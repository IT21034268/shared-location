1,"Dense, Murky, and Confusing","I enountered this text in an introductory microelectronics course. I am a student of electrical engineering with a better than average overall gradepoint. This book was a daily trial. I found the explanations to terse and underdeveloped. Important concepts were buried in dense text. I found the notation adopted extremely confusing. The authors chose a system of circuit diagram conventions that were not clearly explained giving rise to much frustration. My husband is a graduate electrical engineer and he thought it was too advanced for an introductory text. I survived the course by buying several other texts on microelectronics and learning from them. This is a desperate act for a student, I was willing to spend about $200 to get past this text. It is the worst text that I have ever been forced to use."
5,Useful Book for MicroElectronics,"Its a good book with rich examples, quality questions and PSPICE simulations. I would recommend to read this book if you have a knowledge of 'Basic Circuit Analysis'. A good reference book for Electrical and Computer Engineers."
4,A quintessential text for aspiring engineers,"I should start by saying that I'm not an electrical engineer - I'm a chemical engineer by schooling and only dabble in electrical design for fun, or to tackle problems I have to solve. That said, this book is my number one shelf reference for fundaments of analog design. Sedra and Smith lay groundwork for more advanced texts, present clear, efficient examples, and give just enough text to keep the problems moving.This is an engineering text, tried and true, and I've not had any difficulty working the problems in the chapter ends after reading through the text and examples. Maybe my engineering background was better than most of the other readers, but Sedra and Smith seemed to do a fine job in getting me the information I needed to get the job done.Mine's getting worn enough I may have to buy a new copy..."
3,Suits with its price,"Maybe next time the seller should just say about the irremovable pen marks in the book. But since it's price is low, I dont really mind it"
2,This was REALLY late,"This was REALLY LATE. I ordered it on a Friday, and it took 32 days from then until I got it. NOT good. It was a textbook for a class, so I had to make do without a textbook for half of the class. The book itself is fine, it just took forever to get here."
2,Just teach you the equation,"This is not a good book to learn microelectronic.This is because it just teach you many equation and hope u can remember it. I am a university student and i don't think that if i remember the whole thing, i can do all the question. What i want is the method to do it !"
2,Not Worth the Paper it's Printed On,"This is probably one of the poorest text's out there on electronics, mainly because the examples are way too simple for the complexity of the subject. If you can get another text, you'd be much better off"
2,bad book,"you can only use it as a bad reference book. textbook? no way. try Neamen's book.in this field: razavi's; sedra's; neamen's, Jaeger's, I prefer Neamen's and Jaeger's."
3,interior is good but the hard cover is half off the body,in total the book meets my expectation except one side of the cover is really teared off from the body.
4,"Vast amount of information, a most value-for-money textbook","I am a to-be undergraduate majoring in IC design and brought this book for self-study purpose to prepare for my course next year. The structure of the book is neatly organised and is definitely one of the most value-for-money text that I ve ever bought, considering the vast amount of information available in the text itself, the accompanying cd-rom and additional online resources. The point-form summary at the end of each chapter is exceptionally useful. There are also more than enough problems and design-oriented exercises to help students gain a more thorough understanding of each topic covered. I would highly recommended this book to anyone attending a course in electrical and electronic engineering."
2,Marginal quality,"I was excited with this book. Some people told me it's a classic microelectronics textbook, yet I found a glaring deficiency in this book - the lack of in depth explanation and examples. The text material is clear and pretty fun read, but it gives a false sense of security that you understand the subject. And when the homework problems tell you that you don't fully understand the topic, the text does not help much in further understanding. I feel like the book is laughing at me now (you don't understand the concept, and I won't explain it to you, hahaha!). Bad book with an attitude problem! =)"
1,Only for students who love to memorize.,"Authors try too hard in explaining the basics, but are too lazy to explain the more ""challenging"", more practical topics. Beware of words like thus, obviously, etc. which are used as an excuse to not explain things. Like, you'll be reminded constantly that Vbe ~ 0.7V, but when it comes to giving explanations for some of the most important points, they'll let the reader figure out the reasons themselves. So please don't tell me there isn't enough space to explain ""everything"". In other words, if you're a student that likes to memorize rather than understand what's going on, then this book is for you, because the authors fail to inform. And there is plenty of material for you to memorize. The problem of not getting enough EE students to emphasize on analog circuits is partly due to poor textbooks on the subject. If Sedra was writing a book about dogs, a line in his book would go: Because dogs love to lick on bones, flying saucers are round."
2,Very bad book for beginner,"I am a Computer Engineering student at University of Toronto. If you notice, the authors of this book are from my university. I agree that this is a very bad book for beginners because I just finish an Introduction to Electronics course. This book contains too little examples and all of the examples are too easy compare to the exercises. This causes many students to have a difficult time understand the practical concepts. The books has so many errors on the examples. This also makes beginners to be fustrated and it is very time consumming trying to figure out what is wrong while learning at the same time... Last but not least the reason why I think this is a bad book because it doesn't explain how to apply all the concepts to real world problems... It just throw at you all the theories, numbers, and units and not to mentions many are wrong."
2,A mediocre book at best,"Sedra and Smith's book is at best a cookbook of formulas and diagrams with no real explanation of the material presented. It's the textbook used at the University Of Manitoba and sadly used at many other universities. The book is a big disappointment for someone like myself who loves electronics.There are some great books on electronics, ""Art Of Electronics"" by Horowitz and Hill, and ""The ARRL Handbook"" but my pick for the BEST book on LEARNING electronics is ""Electronic Principles"" By Albert Malvino. This is the best book on electronics, bar none. Find this book on Amazon.com, read the reviews. The only negative review is that it is overly geared for beginners. A weakness like that is the books greatest strength. But I use the book on the job daily! Then buy it, read it, and you will not be disappointed!"
4,Good for beginners,Its an excellent book for undergraduates entering into the world of Microelectronic cirbuits. Also for grad students trying to refresh their memory on Analog concepts -- great book.For Analog guys definitely the book to have on their shelves.
4,good for the money,This is a good stereo for the money. It has a good sound output and the video panel has a very nice definition too. Lacks some good features like viewing the mp3 tags and metadata and the radio tuner doesn't work :(
3,Exceptional Book and a lot of material,"This book is worth the price! It gives you a lot of material to work with. I studied these the second time I took the MCAT for a period of 4-5 weeks. After which I took my old Princeton exams, I aced them without even touching my old Princeton notes. While admissionsmystery .com book is great/insightful for AMCAS application strategy, I think these set of books are great for the MCAT."
4,"A Good, Basic Look at Catholic Symbolic Art","W Ellwood Post's look at Catholic symbolic art is a decent job for acquainting people with the rudiments of the symbols one sees in a typical Catholic church (that hasn't undergone the vandalization of the iconoclasts who hijacked Vatican II).There are better books on this topic, mind you, but this one is very good for a basic look at this type of art."
5,Gentle Peaceful Reading,"I thank God the day my friend introduced me to the Jan karon series about Mitford. The whole set is an experience in faith, humility, strength. I was prepared not to like it, and so thankful I became a part of Father Tim and his world in Mitford, and beyond. It takes you back to the basics of life, and what is truly important. God, our faith and trust in Him, and the value of the prayer that never fails ""thy will be done"""
5,None better,You simply won't find a series of books that makes you feel warm and happy like these books do. Jan Karon is the remedy for a heart that feels burdened by world events.
4,Great book for the right audience...,"If the title doesn't excite you then the book won't. Thankfully I found the title very interesting, and my read was very enjoyable.Rushdoony takes the reader through philosophical concepts necessary for any framework of understanding history and shows how the Christian worldview alone is the only one that makes sense and the only one that gives mankind a sense of meaning, hope, and victory.A very interesting read, but not something I would say is necessary for most people. That is, the concept is necessary, but the level this book is written is only for a limited audience (e.g. the people who would get excited about the title). Although...it would be nice if our history teachers who are Christians could articulate in some form some of the views presented by Rushdoony, in keeping with the idea that Christ is indeed the Lord of history."
4,Somewhat Entertaining,"Bought it for a 10 month old. She enjoys scratching and touching the different textures. Entertains her for about 5 minutes. I wish there were more pages. The stickiness of the frog page has worn off in since I bought it, a month ago."
5,Must-have board books for babies,"This was one of the kids' favorite books when they were babies. Great textures and nice resolution photos allow for immediate interaction.Five different textures to feel (hairy, rough, smooth, sticky, furry). Slightly better variety here thanTouch and Feel Baby Animals.These DK books were published over ten years ago but they are just as useful nowadays. Looks like this and Baby Animals have been combined into a new edition:Animals (Baby Touch and Feel)"
5,Great for toddlers,"I found this book at a garage sale and it has become a favorite of my young granddaughters. They love to feel the lion's fur, rub the scaley lizard's skin, and touch the sticky pads on the tree frog's toes. If you want to take the story a step further there is plenty of room to discuss colors, count toes, and talk about the animals!"
2,It Still Sits on the Shelf,"I bought this for my son because I'd heard children go through a phase where they love feeling different textures. Maybe that's true, but he never got into this book at all. It's still sitting on our shelf in case his younger sister likes it, but he never did."
5,Great Photos!,"This board book has a nice variety of animals displayed in clear, sharp photos. The touch and feel aspect adds some fun for little ones."
4,Best Touch & Feel I've seen so far.,"I have looked at the T&F books in stores and decided to try this one out after reading reviews. I ordered from Amazon. The T&F sections are a good size and my 7 month old enjoys pulling the lions hair, but seems most interested in the window on the front cover :). Besides the lion, there is a lizard with bumpy skin, a dolphin with smooth skin, a tree frog with sticky finger pads - I think the sticky pads could be bigger, but then they would probably get dirty, and a Koala with fur."
4,Baby love flipping through the pages,My 9mths old baby loves flipping through the pages by herself and feeling the fur and skins of the animal! ^_^
3,Cute.,"Do you know why the title, ""One Big Happy"" hesitates at one more word? Because this family is not always perfect, that's why. But it's still an adorable little strip all about patient parents trying to put up with the bratty antics of the spoiled little Ruthie and her smart-aleck mouth. But at least Ruthie is funny sometimes while the icky princessy little April from ""For Better Or For Worse"" is NOT! Dimple-cute humor and nice cartoony art."
3,Functions Well But Screen DPI Very Low,"The unit functions well for the intended purposes but overall has a relatively low screen resolution. I expected a higher resolution for a unit that accepted a video connection for a rear-view camera (among other inputs); it seems like that kind of input would dictate a higher resolution for view qualities. I wasn't impressed with the screen - but other than that, it has a lot of great features that work well."
3,"So-so, and very spillable","These are not as great as I thought they would be. The colors are muddy-looking, not nice and bright as they are in the photo. The silicone does not seem to be of as high quality as other silicone products I have. Something about the texture and relative thinness just seems cheap, almost as if the silicone is a bit porous. (I haven't used it enough yet to figure out whether it holds odors, though.) Most significantly, the small base makes these cups VERY easy to tip over. I had hoped to use them when traveling, to do double duty in serving pudding, dipping sauces, etc., but they are just too tippable for that. I wish somebody would come out with a higher-quality set of stackable silicone measuring cups with more stable bases, classier colors and heavier-weight silicone, with a smooth (not pebbly) interior."
2,I didn't quite think this through,"I thought these measuring cups would be terrific -- give a little squeeze to the sides and it makes an easy pour spout. What I'm finding is that when I pick the measuring cup up, the sides squeeze (DUH) but the stuff spills, oozes or falls out of the cup before it can become a convenient spout. I think the product works well for use as a holder for amounts of ingredients but not as true measuring cups."
5,Versatile and fun,"These measuring cups are great quality and colorful. There are especially good to measure sticky peanut butter or icing - these flip inside out so you can easily get the contents out and clean them. When I first started using silcone kitchen items, I was skeptical but now I love them!"
3,Excellent supplementary book,"This book is an excellent source of additional information. As a beginning programmer I found the contents easy to read...although there is almost too much information you will seem like you're fighting your way through a jungle. The only other problem is that the answers aren't always correct, as you will see if you try to run the problems through V.B. 6.0."
3,My best tool to teach Spanish as second language,"Very good book. Using Dialogues teaches all the grammar and the vocabulary taking beginners students to advanced. Must be use under the direction of a teacher, The teacher must use the grammar book of the same serie and know very well the grammar of the spanish as second language.I would like contact the author.Mercedes Bohorquez[...]"
5,The best description I've seen of Southeastern Colorado,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I guess it is because I relate to it having been born and raised in Southeastern Colorado during late 1930's on. This book is about an area I know well and gives a wonderful description of the area and folks there. A great area to live in with some of the best people on earth living there.The land is hard and unforgiving to the weakhearted, warm and challenging to the determined. Gary did this book justice and my family enjoyed it. I want to buy our own copy to read it again and again. Thanks"
4,It ain't flat on the Great Plains!,"I enjoyed this book, sent to me by a high school friend, as I went to the same consolidated high school in Lamar, Colo. as the author (but 2 years ahead of him)and recognized many of the features of that time and place which he describes so well. I was a town kid instead of a country kid but it helps understand better the kids I went to school with. Gary is a great story teller. I hope he didn't stretch it too much in a few places (I don't remember rattle snakes when my friend and I were hiking outside of town--but maybe it was winter). And no, the Great Plains are NOT flat but rolling praire with great views to the horizon sometimes. It's BIG SKY country and I miss though it has been years since I've been there. Thanks, Gary."
5,Up close and personal,"Mr. Penley gives personal details that review his life on the prarie such that reading this book made me feel I knew him. He included facts and opinions about the history of the area that will help document for years to come what took place in that area. His ability to show emotions with words and his willingness to be vulnerable with the details made this a very interesting book. I read his other book too, and highly recommend it as well."
1,Junk,These CD's were the worst I've ever bought. I'm sorry I bothered to order them and would not use them again. One of them had some weird hissing noises in the left channel and then drop-outs after about 70 minutes. I'll stick to other brands in the future.
2,Might not work well for some burners,These CD's are made for 32x but my burner will only burn them at 12x. It could be my burner but I have bought cheaper CD's than these that have worked perfectly with my burner. My advice is to only buy one pack first to see if they work with your burner.
1,Save Your Money,I bought them because they were very cheap. What a mistake!!They do not work at all in my burner. Just bought a new burner a month ago - burns everything beautifully except these 50 pack of drink coasters. Avoid.
1,"32x, Don't believe it.","I've been shopping amazon for years now and this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. This product does not cut the mustard. Using a CD burner that has burned and continues to burn many a CD, these things weren't readable at 32 or 16, and I've had some failures at 8. I was low on drink coasters anyway."
3,Average,"The three reviews above knocking these cds are posted on every website I see. The CDs are average, I had no problems..."
1,No rebate,"I had the same experience as Tatyana -- purchased the discs because of rebate, then couldn't find info on how to get the rebate. What's up with that?"
4,Sky writing fascists? Check.,"This is the first Bolano book I've read that feels like it's explicitly about Chile and not Latin America as a whole. Alberto Ruiz Tagle is a terrifying creation, the sort of person who seems just as comfortable arguing about Spanish poetry as he would be slitting someone's throat. He isn't just a cheap personification of the horrors of the Pinochet regime (which was completely horrifying), but a genuinely frightening murderer in his own right. Even the fabulist spectacle of him sky-writing poetry over Chile becomes transformed into a monstrous, bloated gesture of doom. Bolano kind of reminds me of J.M. Coetzee in that he's more interested in exploring the damned, barely hinted at collateral damage of a violent history than he is in just re-hashing that history. If you don't have any familiarity at all with the Chilean coup of 1973, a lot of the tone in Distant Star, the general atmosphere, might be confusing. Though I don't think it would be any less menacing."
3,Distant Star,"What is the book about?Distant star starts off around the time of Pinochet's bloody 1973 coup and continues until the 1990's. The unnamed narrator, who I presume to be Arturo B. which is briefly mentioned in the preface, is so busy with Chilean poetry that he is completely taken back with surprise when many students are arrested, killed, or missing in the coup. He has taken a sudden and obsessive interest in a poet named Alberto-Ruiz Tangle who turns out to be an Officer of the Air Forcer named Carlos Wieder. The narrator begins some intense detective work, with the help of his friends, to find the answers he is looking for.What is the book about?I love a good horrific and violent book and this book is exactly that. Although the writing style reminds me of Juan Rulfo, who isn't my favorite, I can certainly see the appeal and value it for it's worth. It's a quick 150 page read that is unique and violent in it's own specific way."
2,Too weird and winding,"I suppose ""weird"" is the best word for this book. I'm not sure whether it's a commentary on ultra-right wing politics, a memoir of the Pinochet era, or a criticism of the literary world. Maybe it's all three.The narrative is hard to follow at times. The digressions seem pointless for anything other than setting a mood. Maybe I can't understand it because I'm not Chilean, or didn't live under Pinochet, or because I'm not a poet. Who knows? I'm glad it's over."
3,Good ... but not perfect,It's a good book but not a perfect one. Sometimes it's confused and the life of Wieder (the main character of the story) is not well defined.
1,A tough read- not worth it,"Boring beyond belief, at least half of the book consists of endless, rambling conjectures about what may have happened to the narrator's heroes, friends and friends of friends during the Pinochet regime. The ""realism"" in the book consists of one vulgar scene after another sprinkled with bathroom profanity. If you can parse its pages for the (somewhat unrealistic) plot, the action has a couple of suspenseful moments, but the ending feels inevitable and unsatisfying, to say the least. The process of figuring out its message is tough - definitely not worth the time."
1,Lasted a few months,"It only ""telescoped"" for a few months before something in the inside won't grab the pole anymore.Poorly made."
3,Works OK,"Watch out for a sharp burr on the end of the pole. After two season's of use the holes elongated. I'll probably cut off the end and drill new holes. The pole works well, but long term durability is lacking."
1,Junk,"Not sure if it's intentional but the seller has sent me a device that seems to be used/refurbished and or some type of return repackaged item. I tested it and it's just not price worthy. It's really over priced for it's cheap parts. It's light, and compared to the one I was replacing is just inferior (which was half the price)."
4,Great emotional movie,Its a unexpacted deep emotional movie .A men that has stopped living a long time ago.Will start to live again when he meets JIA.iTS A RAW BEAUTIFUL MOVIE!
3,"It looses its way somewhere, somehow","I watched it only now. Great script. Amitabh Bachchan's performance was sterling. So what prevented the movie from becoming truly memorable?1. The length. It should have been longer where the relationship between Amitabh and Jia should have been shown developing into a very strong bond, emotionally and physically. And even her exit should have been more emotional.2. The background music - which at most palces gave the movie the feel of a horror/suspense thrillerThe last 3-4 minutes of monologue were brilliant."
2,For light duty work only,"We all know how hard it is to cut a straight line with a Rotozip. I thought this may help, but it's not really good when you have to cut through something like 3/4"" MDF for any distance over 4"". It binds up as you pull the whole thing along if you don't keep one hand on the edge. Better off strapping on a straight edge than trying to use this to keep the saw from wandering."
4,Great Storage,These no longer made fellows containers are perfect for storing and keeping track of large DVD collections. I just wish they were easier to obtain.
4,Small problem,"The crystal is fabulous but I had a small problem with the seller. I ordered 4 and got 1. Communication with the seller, Elizabethsgifts, was confusing and by the time they understood what had happened I ended up spending more on special delivery than product."
4,Perfect...except for one thing...,"This piece is beautiful. However, as the other review states...the one I didn't read before purchasing...mine came with gold finish on the metal instead of silver. I gave it four stars only because the color is a big deal for me. Otherwise, this is a stunning and functional piece."
5,Beautiful,"This piece is a lovely addition to my set of Italian Countryside. The only thing to note is that the metal hardware is actually gold in hue and not silver as it appears in the photograph. Even still, it's very pretty and useful when having guests over."
2,"Metal Lunch Box with Disney ""Cars""","I encouraged my son to buy a metal lunch box this year because I was so tired of trying to clean and disinfect the plastic ones he's used over the past several years. (The plastic absorbs smells and I have vowed to avoid them in the future.) The ""Cars"" lunchbox seemed to fit our needs, as my son loved the movie. I decided to splurge for the $9.99 cost because we had searched many other places and this had not been available. So far, so good.But here's what I hadn't counted on:** The lunchbox is quite small, even for a kindergartener. We will have to cram the food in and pack the thermos separately.** The $9.99 price was bearable, but the additional $5.99 in shipping fees put the cost of this over the top. I forgot to think about that when we made the purchase, so the mistake was mine.My overall assessment: This purchase was a mistake. Cute, but not big enough and too costly!"
4,A great reference,"This book is almost all a student of economics must have in order to face international economy with solid basis. However, it is only a first approach and it would be useful to consult other good texts like Appleyard & Field`s or even the Krugman ones which is quite elemental. If you try it, you won`t feel disappointed."
4,Miss Zukas at the Bellehaven Cultural Center,"Miss Zukas, a librarian in Bellehaven Washington, is asked to catalogue a collection of Native American books and memorabilia in the new Cultural Center. She is replacing Stanley Plummer whose dead body was found in the ladies' restroom at the Center, having been stabbed by a spindle-wielding murderer. She is not particularly pleased at having been ""loaned"" to the Center without her consent and is somewhat apprehensive as to whether she may be the next target of the murderer. In self-defense, and armed with her usual curiosity and powers of observation, Miss Zukas carries on her own investigation. As usual, her sidekick, the freewheeling artist Ruth, assists Miss Zukas in her pursuit of the killer. While working at the Center, Miss Zukas learns a lot about the Indian culture and meets some very interesting characters. With this book, Jo Dereske produces another delightful and entertaining ""cozy"" in her Miss Zukas Mystery Series."
4,Miss Zukas,"Fast read, no gore (a plus for me.) I did not figure it out (also a plus.) Having not read not read any of the other Miss Zukas series it would have been nice to know more about each of the main characters."
2,Basic writing and character development,"The story line was okay, but there was almost no character development. I felt like the whole thing might just have been an edited version containing only first lines of each paragraph, because there was so little to flesh out who these people are and why they relate to one another as they do (or don't). At least the book was free."
1,Good hard copy book but dismal on Kindle,"I have the hard copy of this book and love it. I was thrilled to see that it is available for the Kindle and immediately purchased it so that I could always have a copy with me. However, there is no table of contents and the book's index isn't ""clickable"". Essentially this leaves this electronic copy of the book nearly useless. This is a huge reference book and without a way to navigate its practically impossible to use. What a disappointment."
5,Excellent Bible Study Tool,"Bullinger's is an excellent Bible study tool. The book is balanced and has a long history of use in the Christian community. I bought it to replace an older copy.This book is for Bible teachers, Pastors, and above. It is a bit involved for anyone not involved in deep, continous study of the word. It is not an ""easy to read book."" It is more like a dictionary where you can look up passages or specific figures of speech and see how they are used in the Bible.I highly recommend it."
1,This is the e-version,"I was very disappointed in the e-version of this product, all the sentences and paragraphs are run together so that I found it very difficult to identify the material I was looking for. I may try the printed form next after I can save the money up, but I thought I would try the e-version since it was only 98 cents...and believe me, I got exactly what I paid for. If I could get a refund for what I received, I would, but its not even worth the hassle."
1,I wasted $72,"The book (paper version) is cryptic. If you invest the time, it can be of some value, but it has no table of contents, is poorly organized, and the index is a waste of paper, because its page numbers do not correspond to the pages on this edition. For example, 'Apparent refusal' is discussed on page 962, but the book has less than 700 pages!It is too cryptic to be used for leisurely reading; its index is unusable and it has no table of contents. Why would anyone want this book in hardcopy form?"
2,Not for the casual reader,"Having bought the book based on the reviews, I found it best tailored for researchers or graduate students who want assistance in their exegesis exercises; it is not an easy book to read or use during the course of scripture studies. If you are interested in understand an English translation with nuances of the original language (but biased in their own way), I would recommend Everett Fox's _The Five Books of Moses_, J.B. Phillips' _New Testatment in Modern English._, or perhaps even David Stern's _Complete Jewish Bible_ (Messianic perspective for the last)."
4,as advertised,Fit my seat like a champ. Sturdy and well built. Very easy to install. Does not come with mounting bolts.
3,Started out good...buuuuut,The book started out pretty good and about half way through the pace went racing to the finish. The timing of everything was no very clear and certain characters seem to get lost and pop back up and I'd forget who they were. It was a quick and easy read and it was ok but not anything great. Overall grade - C-
1,Poorly written,"I am surprised by all the 5 star reviews for this novel. Even if you are fascinated by the thought of alien visitations, there is just no getting around the fact that this book is poorly written. None of the characters are really fleshed out, and that kept me from ever really getting into the story."
3,Interesting plot,"The plot was interesting, and included many of the different aspects of UFO mythology, perhaps too many aspects. I found it intriguing, but I was a bit disappointed in the ending. My husband was having trouble keeping track of the action, as the plot jumped around between locales and times, and introduced a lot of different characters without fleshing them out as well as we could have hoped."
3,Good until the end,"This book started out great with a great story line and it gave you lots to think about (is there some truth woven into this story?). However the book fell apart with a horrible ending that read like no thought was put into. If it wasn't for the ending, I would have given the book 5 stars."
1,sounds like a good book,"this sounded like a good story but when the price of the hard back is only $0.20 and the kindle version is at $7.99 there is a problem, i object to paying extra for the electronic version than the printed version when the electronic version costs so much less to produce and handle which is a pity as i think i would have liked it.it is time amazon got their act together and realised they are loosing lots of sales due to this problem."
2,Laughable,"The book is fast-paced and interesting. That said, the characters came off as one-dimensional. The plot is ridiculous -- we're supposed to believe that a bunch of kidnapping monsters who torture their victims are here to ""help"" mankind? The government and military are portrayed as pure evil, coldly killing people left and right to maintain the conspirary. (How original.) The aliens are made out to be some sort of Machiavellian matchmakers in the mold of ""Stefano"" from ""Days of our Lives."" I had to laugh at when they set up an affair between a married man and his boss to accomplish their ""goals."" Overall entertaining but not in the way the author intended, I'm sure."
3,Ummm.....,"This was a good thriller, but I can only give it three stars. Here's why:- Whitley Strieber has had some very profound experiences, which I have found very compelling over the past twenty years. So, after twenty years, I come to find the meaning behind these experiences is the plot from the X-files.- There is an issue with the characters' ages at the beginning; which really annoyed me. I expect better from an author of Whitley's caliber. But, proof-reading should have caught this, as well.- The book does end by setting-up a sequel. The reviews of 2012 do not make it sound like a sequel.Overall, I expected much more from this and was let down."
2,Incoherent UFO-ology,"This novel (if that is what it was) is really just a jumbled regurgitation of various UFO conspiracy internet websites. There is not much of a storyline here, the Greys are not thought-provoking, and in fact you can get more interesting speculation about aliens on any number of internet websites than you get in this novel.I gave this one two stars because I did manage to finish it, sort of. Strieber is capable of writing a good book and a good story, but this is not one of them. Pass it by."
1,"Horrible, front to back","The character development was totally anemic. I was over halfway through the book and realized I didn't give a flip about anyone in the story, as I never got to know them.The only time the story kind of hits a smooth point, is when characters are alone, either reflecting or thinking to themselves. If you get two or more people talking at once everything gets scattershot.And the military scenes were simply laughable, as was about 90% of the rest of the book."
2,Mediocre,"The only reason I purchased this book was that it was suggested as a prequal to ""2012"". The two books have nothing to do with each other. It is written by Whitley Strieber who claims to be an alien abductee. There was so many muddled story lines they were to keep track of."
5,The Grays,I have an hour and half commute to work everyday to and fro. This audio book helped make the drive fly by.I heard about this book on a radio program Coast to Coast AM in the middle of the night. It sounded good there and decided to check it out.Really good story.
5,Me 'n The Grays,"Read it. Started out a bit gruesome, but became most interesting after the first chapter.From events worldwide, this could contain more truth than most people would expect.Good write."
2,Streiber has lost his talent,"Years ago I really enjoyed Whitley Streiber's novels. Wolfen, the hunger and Warday I found very compelling. Unfortunately these days I think he needs to find and pay attention to a good editor. This book's story wanders around his alien agenda but very few of the characters seem more than just cardboard. I found the 'resolution' to fall flat as well. Worth a buck or two to kill time in an airport but not much more."
2,Not so hot,"I like Whitley's stuff. But this one wasn't his best. The parents talked like idiots and acted the fool. The kids were ho-hum and tedious. And in the end I couldn't keep any of them straight, nor did I really want to. I could care less."
4,Destiny's Song,"Kim doesn't waste any time. By the end of Chapter One, the reader already identifies with Destiny, knows her plight and has been introduced to three men, one of whom is the mystery figure watching her from the stairs of the Atlanta home she is visiting. Kim knows how to keep the tension and the action going. This is also a wonderful, romantic escape from reality for those of us who will never have an affair with a famous, handsome musician! Go Kim!"
1,They look like $0.99 items,"I bough them as a gift for my wife. They look like 0.99 items and shipping was the worst part,it took almost a month for me to receive them. I am very disappointed with product and seller."
3,OK for learning Mandarin,"You need a formal teacher to lead you through this. I had one and it worked. Some material needs to be added. After a semester, the book still does not teach you how to say ""good morning"", ""Where is the bathroom?"" etc and the more mundane conversational phrases."
3,Could have been more precise,"As a textbook, The New Practical Chinese Reader leaves much to be desired. The format of each chapter is as follows: Dialogue, vocabulary, random non-concise grammar points, some hanzi information, and a one paragraph culture tid-bit. I feel that where the textbook is lacking is in it's breakdown of the grammar. Dialogues are given but very little it said of actual syntactic structure as well as why and how things are said in Chinese. Occasionally, you are given an asterisk that tells you about a phrase. Also, there is very little that is ever said in regards to Chinese culture which is very important when learning a language. Culture gives back ground and answers many ""whys?"" to a language. I feel the textbook could have contained more information."
3,Not very satisfied with the product,Not sturdy at all. My bottle brush I bought from my home brew store was built a lot more sturdy. This is a cheap product overall. I would not recommend to buy. It's not even long enough for a 6ft carboy.
4,it's adequate,"It works, but it could be made better, the bristles don't seem dense enough. It does the job, but it's hard to reach the bottom of the carboy, especially if you need to scrub with any effort. You have no leverage. I have to go over areas twice or three times to get them cleaned properly."
3,...won't mind if i tell you...,"goo isn't a bad album, but it is one of sonic youth's""worst"". then again, ... goo is actually better than DDN because of cool songs like ""titanium expose"", a really cool kim/thurston duet thing, ""mote"", ""dissappearer"", etc.get ""washing machine"" ""a thousand leaves"" or ""nyc ghosts & flowers"" before this one."
3,Good.,"This album is not excellent nor is it bad, just good. It's the bands first major label album and it holds it's own. Worth looking into, but overhyped.For truly amazing Sonic Youth ablums, look into their 80s career."
1,Poop,"The relentless pursuit of ""White Light/White Heat"" without the balls, brains, passion, and (most importantly) cool."
2,harsh and unpleasant,"Whereas ""Sister"" and ""Daydream Nation"" have a lot of creativity, I just don't like this one. The only songs that I like is ""Mote"" and the ""Scooter-Jinx"" effects. for its long five minute jam at the end but that's it. Otherwise ""Goo"" is unintersitingly melodic and noisy.My least favorite album."
3,Where to next for SY?,"This is the sound of Sonic Youth figuring out where to go after the landmark Daydream Nation. The logical progression was to go onto a major label, but Goo is unconvincing despite containing all the trademark aspects of their sound. Some of Goo sounds like Daydream Nation outtakes, but the band would sharpen their focus on their next release, Dirty, which fully embraces the punk/grunge sound only hinted at here. Somewhat overrated in their illustrious canon, but still recommended."
4,Really interesting to read about the recording process..,"I'm reading a bio of the band right now by David Browne. It's really good, if you're wondering. Totally have to read it if you're so inclined.I just got to the part where they record Goo. It was the record they made right after Daydream Nation (my fav of theirs), and also the first record they made for a major label (Geffen records).Here is what Kim Gordon (bassist, vocalist for Sonic Youth) had to say about this record:""Talking about the record (Goo) with a friend, Kim seemed particularly dejected. 'That's not us, that's not Sonic Youth,' she told him. Later, she told a friend that when she heard the final mixes, she started crying"" (Browne 210).Now, this is my favorite SY record after Daydream. I find it so odd that she felt that way, and that things in the studio were so problematic and difficult."
2,Not necessarily needed noise,"2 1/2Aside for a few redemptive riffs which helped to usher in the new sound of grunge, the arty punk stays muddled in distortion-based power chord predictability."
2,SOME WHAT CHEAPLY MADE,"Although pretty, these wedges are uncomfortable. the straps rub and the rubber soul came off after walking from my car to the office, Maybe 60 yards away.( in optimist mode)>>> I dont mind saving money but come on now... the rubber soul came off. In front off the toe, I think its might be because I usually get the wedges that have a curved up toe. Dont know, Dont care it came off"
2,Layout...??,"This book, as well an several other Peach Pit Press books, did a great job of immediately losing my interest. The layout doesn't seem to flow from one section to the next. It seems like the author thought of a new topic at random, and dumped that information in the book with no consideration for logical order. In general, it seems that most of the Peach Pit Press books that I've read follow this ""shuffling of information"" approach."
3,Bang for less than a buck,"Content is informative. Book condition is marginal, but it was only 90 cents or so. Got the bang for less than a buck!"
2,It's mostly black and white,"How can you do a great Photoshop book in black and white? Turns out, you can't. There is a lot of good reference material here, but it doesn't connect very well. And the full color section at the middle of the book that you would expect to have the color versions of some of the examples had artwork from a variety of artists.I recommend O'Reilly's Adobe Photoshop CS One-on-One instead."
3,Ok book,This book is OK to learn Photoshop but I wish that it had more color pictures and more examples of the possibility of such a program.I saw better book than this.
1,not work like reference book,"I try to use imageready 7 but online help/user guide do not help me.. I try to read thisbook but page 443 do not talk about Windows nor Mac OS color reduction algorithmthat I want to know.in page 475, author do not tell me what's a Out, Up, None, Custom and SelectedRollover is.. (I really want to know)for the big mistake is, no support forum reader-to-reader, email, support, errata check, ..nothing..the pro of this book is it's cover 95% of photoshop 7 but the con is where is 5% left ?then THIS BOOK IS NOT WORK LIKE REFERENCE BOOK anyway!"
3,Better Price Elsewhere?,"I am searching for this album, but does anyone else know where else ""in the world"" that you can order this album or download the songs for less than $231.91(used)....no offense but times are hard and I LOVEEEEEE Yolanda Adams and have just about all of her albums but cannot imagine paying that much money for a album...Gave it 3 stars due to price.........God bless!"
3,Tight Assets:Body Conditioning,"I purchased a copy of this video as I wanted to start using weights during my exercise regime. The upper body work is very good on this video for someone who hasn't used weights - you can start with lighter weights - and the more experienced weight lifters can use heavier weights or do more reps. I'm afraid to say that the claim that the video incorporates aerobic exercise with weights is a bit misleading - that is not aerobic exercise, it is a warm up. Also the lower body work isn't a challenge to someone who can just about cope with the third section in the video 'Cher Fitness - A New Attitude' - now there's a challenge!"
1,Travesty In Blue,"A. H. Lawrence has written a book filled with errors on almost every page. Lawrence's lack of scholarship will seriously call into question the lack of Routledge's editorial integrity if not its motives - unless the publisher decides to recall the product.If you really want to see this book, wait until it is remaindered or piled on the ""free"" table - that should be soon."
1,Shame on Routledge,"This abysmally inaccurate ""biography"" should never have been published. It is obvious that neither Routledge nor A.H. Lawrence had any reverence for the facts, despite the liberal use of plagarized passages from authoritative works. There are many books on Ellington that are well worth having. Not this one."
4,Worth listening to a few hundred times over.........,"I first heard this CD playing at an antique shop on Cape Cod & luckily the owner had a single copy to sell to me. I've listened to it dozens of times in a few short weeks. From the jacket notes, Sarah Brooks is a newly discovered artist by NorthStar music. It's superb ""sit by the fire with a glass of wine"" music. I'm an avid Eva Cassidy fan & there's something about Sarah Brooks that is similar...She's got a great take on old favorites that adds a touch of blues??jazz??...I will definitely be looking forward to hearing more from her. I especially enjoy her gutsy version of ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" and ""Ain't No Sunshine""."
2,"pretty shoes, fragile leather","I absolutely loved these shoes, BUT the second time I wore them they tore where the side of the shoe attached to the top of the shoe. I liked them so much I was even going to buy a replacement pair, but they no longer have them in my size."
3,The Verbal is good but I question the Physical Sciences and Biology!!!,"As stated before there are several passages that can be insanely difficult. I do not know if this was intentional or them just trying to put many concepts into 1 passage. But it is very easy to become discouraged after taking a few of these.Also, I noticed that some concepts being tested in certain exams are not even covered until later chapters in the regular books. For example, test #7 Physical sciences deals with thermodynamics and machines. However, a few questions were asked on topics (in particular Q = MC delta T for calorimetry) not covered until later chapters. So it may be wise to do an initial study of all topics before taking these tests.I would recommend the practice tests given by the MCAT home site first in addition to the 1001 Examkrackers series to really get a feel for the topics. Then if you want more punishment this is for you."
2,no editing,Nobody edited this book. There are too many spelling and grammatical errors too count in this book. Some of the errors are so egregious that you have a hard time understanding what examkracker actually intended to write. I wouldnt have bought this book had I known it.
2,BEWARE,"there are a multitude of typos.... sometimes the answer choices have an asterisk indicating that one answer is correct... some answers are flat out wrong, and the passages are much harder than the actual MCAT passagesalthough it is good practice, don't waste your money"
2,Many errors,"I purchased this book to supplement the other Examkrackers materials that I am using, and am very disappointed. The verbal section of Exam 1 is riddled with ridiculous typos (""Itit"" is not a word) and question 30 reads like a word salad :""...clarify his argument withAn appropriate clarification of the passage would be the stipulation that:his the author's argument applies only to both:A. the present and future...""Yes, it is written just like this, and no, context does not help. This is exam 1. What do the others look like? If they didn't bother to do the easy editing, how can any part of it be taken seriously?Don't waste your time or money with this book."
2,Expect typos.,"I feel that there are a lot of prodcuts out there that are both beneficial than this book. It is good for early morning practice to stimulate your brain, but I would not use it as a primary means of studying.First of all, the book is full of typos. For some, this might not be a problem, but I found it highly distracting.Secondly, the explanations for correct answers was poor. I found myself referring back to other books to figure out the answers.Third, these are only one hour mini-tests, so that introduces two new issues. You cannot really use these tests as an assessment, because they are so short. On the same day, I could score 6/16 on the biology section. Later, the same day, I could score 14/16. Also, being short, they do not help with preparing endurance for the actual exam.While I did not find this book very helpful, I would recommend the 1001 question series. I used the o-chem and physics books, and found those questions much engaging."
1,Worthless,"I was excited to purchase this book, because the idea of a shortened MCAT seemed great to me especially considering the time constraints of my schedule. The book is completely filled with mistakes, typos, etc. Some questions make absolutely no sense. It is difficult to take a timed test if you are spending your time trying to understand what the question is supposed to be asking. The people who rated this book with more than 2 stars obviously have not opened it, becauset the errors start in the first ""mini-mcat."" Extremely disappointed in Exam Krackers."
2,Garbage,"Was this seriously not edited before being published? The frequency of errors, typos and word repeats actually make some questions completely unintelligible. The material was also too easy to properly prepare you for the mcat. The real question here is whether the refund is worth repackaging and walking to the post office."
1,"Book FULL of errors, WRONG copy","I purchased this book several months ago and began taking practice exams only to find it riddled with errors. The verbal sections have excessive typos that hinder the ability to read. There are repeated words, choices with out letters, and questions that stop mid-section. A classmate of mine has another copy of this book that is the SAME edition but does not have any of these mistakes. The book was obviously corrected, and I was under the impression when buying this copy that I was purchasing the most recent version. VERY dissatisfied with this purchase as I now have to go buy the correct copy."
4,Good to use if you're short on time,"I started using this book from the second chapter. Which is GOOD because otherwise I would've tossed it out in the trash if I had started w/ chapter one and saw the 1209812098 typos it had. I think the verbal sections in the later chapters are also full of typos but whatever, it's not a big deal. It's still a decent book for a wide range of practice problems."
2,ok but not great,Compared with the acutal mcats it is not a accurate representation. They seem to cover details that are not even covered in any of the AMCAS practice test or even on the real mcat I took. The verbal passages are horrible. Overall I think its not worth it.
4,"Confusing title, satisfying film","Hewing closely as it does to the basic outline of ""Hamlet"", I expected not to be surprised by ""Let the Devil Wear Black""--but this movie is liberated enough to function admirably well on its own with its own quirks, internal logic, and occasional flashes of real wit.Jonathan Penner, a stunningly beautiful actor, portrays a hero whose history of institutionalization keeps our response to his deep suspicion and contacts with his dead father ambivalent--is there a hideous conspiracy afoot, or is Jack just losing it?? Mary-Louise Parker is suitably fragile as his nut-house sweetheart, and the two share love scenes which, despite their graphic nature, still come off as tender and spontaneous, neither brutal nor obligatory.The supporting performances were equally strong--not a false note in the bunch. Again, I was surprised to find this movie so engrossing, but I was entirely caught up in Jack's dilemma--and he even made me laugh out loud once or twice."
3,A little Pepto will do.,"Hamlet set in the sleazy underworld of L.A.I saw half of this on cable and thought what the hell, So I bought it and was pleasantly surprised. The Acting is Top notch, Great Character actors Maury Chaukin,Phillip Baker Hall. and Mary Louise Parker all do a fine job. The Alas poor Yorik Scene works really Well.So if you like contemporary updates of the Bards work. Check this one out.3 and 1/2 stars."
3,L. A. crime story,"Hamlet hit's L. A. is the basis of this story & that pretty much explains it. It is always nice to see Jacqueline Bisset & she is here. Mary-Louise Parker appears even more so that Jacqueline. The story replaces Hamlet's time & culture with modern day L. A. Hello gun's, hello mob, hello bars, hello, hello, and hello. The script was not totally transparent & I did enjoy it some. I just wish it had varied more from a story that is so well known & of course, already better done. Lazy writing with OK acting & pretty women. 3.5 stars."
5,wonderful,I love this video. I bought hair pieces and wefts and i was able to do the styles. Im so glad i got this video. NOW i can do styles on my clients when i have to do a big bridal party and i dont have to rush. Each style is about no more than 10mins to do. It's fast and quick. I even amaze myself. When will there be another video i would like to buy some more videos from Ron Soto. I would recommend it to other hair dressors if they need some ideas on styles
4,Simple & sweet,The video is easy to follow. Ron shows great techniques that are very easy to follow & any person can use if they are serious about the art of updo's
5,Most played with toy,"I too bought this for my son when he was 2 1/2 and he is now just turning 8 and still playing with it. My almost 3 year old plays with it EVERY day, it still looks the same as when I bought it and of all the toys they have, and believe me they have plenty, this must be the most played with item. They both play at Pizzaman and sell me hot pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner, strangley enough they don't eat pizza!If you are thinking about getting it, go ahead it is the best money you will spend on your child this year."
4,Pizza fun!,"I got this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves to play with her tea set so now we have pizza and tea. The product is great except the pizza cutter keeps popping apart when she cuts the pizza. I always have to pop it back together for her. Overall the product is fun and realistic, it looks so delicious- she loves it so that's all I really care about."
2,Dangerous for little kids,Cheese lid came off and plastic sprinkles went everywhere dangerous for small children and babies. If u throw out toppings kids enjoy
4,18 months and loves it,My daughter loves this toy although the Velcro could be hard at times to break apart. Majority of the time she is able to use the pizza cutter and succeed. She absolutely loves using the shakers to serve us with our pizza. Ace to use for this age and would recommend it to a friend.
5,Pizza anyone?,This was a Christmas present for my nephew. I don't know what it is but kids always love this pizza product. My grandson has a set too and plays with it often. Very realistic.
1,Junk!,"Do not buy this toy pizza, it is ABSOLUTE JUNK! Most of the toy pizzas I've seen from my friends kids are made of rubber and are bigger, this one is junky plastic and small! (unfortunately there was not a description for this one when I purchased it at Amazon and I chanced it, what a mistake) The velcro is so strong that when you cut the pizza the pieces stick right back together (very frustrating for my girls). Therefore... it makes the serving knife useless because you can't even get the pizza apart with the pizza cutter, AND the cutter broke the first day my girls used it. [...] Their toy birthday cake that I bought from them is even worse than the pizza! [...]I honestly feel the two toys that I purchased from him are the lowest quality I've ever purchased for my kids!!"
5,Great play food!,"My 4-year-old son received this for Chrsitmas this year from his grandparents - he loves it. Very realistic looking and the velcro holds together nicely, but without being so strong he struggles to part the pieces! He really loves to use the pizza wheel to cut slices and serve them to us! Overall, this is a very nice set! :-) I'd definitely recommend it to others!"
2,Disappointment,Mr. Radhakrishan's intepretation of Dhammapada and Buddhism in general is twisted. He insist against basic Buddhist teachings many things for instance that there are permanent self and thatthere are universal spirit. Radhakrisnan's view of Buddhism is colored by his own religion- Hinduism. Although some comments of verses are insightful the book confuses Buddhist reader more than makes him more understading about Buddha's teachings. I can not recommend this version of Dhammapada.
5,closet doubler,"The closet doubler really helped us organize our closet, it is very easy to hang up and seems very strong and well made. I should have bought it years ago!"
1,Not good for me,I threw this out after it fell off my closet rod for the third time. The hanger parts aren't long enough for a larger closet rod - measure yours before ordering.
4,Works Great,"I bought this on the basis of good Amazon.com reviews. I've been using it for a week now with no problems. You just put up the two side rods and then hang the horizontal rod between them. I love the adjustable heights. I use this because I share a closet with my daughter. I put her clothes on top (she's too young to dress herself) and mine below. I was worried the hooks on this were designed specifically for the wooden, round closet bars (as shown in the photo), but I have the white plastic/metal rack style of closet bar and this doubler works just great.Would definitely recommend this; easy to use, good quality, and inexpensive."
1,A Waste of Money!,This product was a total waste of money. I couldn't hang anything on this rack because even my smallest cami was too long and hung over the second rack (I'm a size small or medium). I tried using this product in my eight year old daughter's closest and even her clothes were too long. I would only recommend this for an infant's room because for a child or adult it is completely useless!!!
4,great product for the price,"the product is great for the price, however, i'm not too happy with the company (organize.com). they were very slow to ship and never responded to 2 emails i sent. shipping was the cost of the product too...and the fact that it didn't ship fast, it didn't seem worth it..."
1,Does not work well with a tight closet,"This item arrived to me bent.It is very bulky, wide and the bottom bar only works if your top bar is really high.If you are looking to maximize closet space in at tight closet, I recommend the followingSET OF 2 STEEL HANGER CASCADERSI am returning this item."
4,Good,"Good for smaller closets however, the length adjustment needs to be fixed and should be allowed to vary evern more."
5,Just as advertised,This hook is going to be a great tool for reorganizing my closet! I love that you can choose the height of the bar and customize it to your needs. Package arrived quickly and as described.
4,Perfect!,This is exactly what I was looking for to make more room in my son's closet as well as organize it! I would recommend this to anyone.
5,Excellent,"This has saved me SO much space. The low price is just the cherry on top. I highly recommend this product, just check your closet measurements first. I didn't check and shouted ""YOLO"" while purchasing, kind of dumb of me but luckily it fit just fine :)"
5,Works wonders in the closet!,"I was skeptical of this item after reading all the reviews, but it ended up working perfectly. The height of the the two spaces to hang clothing works just right, but do keep in mind that I hang just my shirts on top and bottom. As a female of average height, my shirts are short enough to accommodate the space with no problem. Incredibly easy to install."
2,Not what I expected,"The closet doubler sounded like a great idea, until I tried it in my closet. In my closet I cannot hang clothes on the top rod without clothes hanging about 2 or 3 inches below the bottom rod on the lowest setting. Perhaps it is just my closet, but I recommend that you double check the measurements to make sure it will work for your clothes. I think this would work very well for children's clothing!"
1,Couldn't use it,The arms are too long for the Whitmor 6058-90 garment rack and my shirts touch the floor when hanging on this organizer. Waste of money.
1,Not good,I bought this based on other great reviews but I do not understand how anyone would like this. It is too short so you cannot fit anything on the top bar without it hanging over the bottom there is only about 2 feet of space between the 2. No impressed this will be a garage sale item
5,double your closet space,"This has really helped me organize my closet and provide additional space so my clothes aren't packed in so tightly they get wrinkled hanging in the closet. It was just what I was looking for. Had to rearrange some things as they were dragging on the floor from the lower level, but it works great."
3,That's ok,"That's ok, but it really don't fit well in my closet.But the material and everything else is ok! Tks"
4,Nifty way to get more rack space,Works really well and is sturdy. We haven't abused it by hanging heavy stuff but looks lie it can take it. A good way to get more hanging real estate in closets.
2,short tops,"The bar doesn't hang very low so unless you have really short items to hang on top, this doesn't work very well. I have never been able to use it even for my tank tops. It doesn't even work for my pants that I fold over on the hanger."
2,point\tless,it gives room for baby cloths and your shirts may be touching the floor a waist for me and my girl friend
4,Functional,"Got it for my kids' closet so they can get their own clothes in the morning. It works out great, just the right height for them and the clothes. Good buy."
5,It's been a lifesaver!!,"I have to share a closet with not only my husband, but my daughter as well. We live in a small two bedroom and only one bedroom has a closet. For years we've been having trouble with other closet doubler rods, they were always hard to keep in place and only had one length on it which was hard to decide whose clothes went on top and bottom because it always dragged someone's clothes.With this Adjustable Closet Doubler, it has saved our wardrobe. My daughters clothes go on top and I have the rod just below them, giving my clothes room to hang. Now, they don't slide around on the floor and get dusty or wrinkly. This product has just been a lifesaver! And it was so easy to put together, I thought that it was almost too easy! : )I recommend it anyone who is wanting more space in their closet but with low cost!"
2,Poorly constructed low strength,If you only need to hang a dozen blouses on this hanger it might be OK but if you need to hang a dozen pairs of jeans choose a different product.
4,Love it!,It's exactly what I needed. The fact that the bottom rack is adjustable is great. My daughter is only six so her tops are short but there's room to lower it as she grows. Would be great for babies on up.I just wish I had found it sooner. I'm only hanging shorts on the bottom rack b/c I have other oranizers for shoes in the bottom of the closet.
5,Works perfectly,"I was very skeptical when I was purchasing this item. But when it came I was impressed and it worked exactly how I wanted it to work. It is very sturdy and if you are looking for a quick fix for a little more space in your closet, then this is it."
4,Works well,"This does the job, however the rod in my closet must be lower than ""average"". I had to raise up the lower hooks and now my shirts rest on the rod, I'm thinking the tanks in the picture are short as it is a bit deceptive. The metal is fairly sturdy, although the directions say 30lb maximum. Some purses have a lot of hardware on it so I woudln't recommend hanging heavy ones on the hooks (which are a bit small). I might give mine to my nice who can put it in her dorm closet and double her space. She's a size 0 so her shirts arn't as long as mine which would make this ideal for her."
3,No instructions!?!,"This rack did not come with instructions and it was hard to tell how to put it together. I did figure it out by looking at the picture online, but it did not seem too sturdy. Gravity holds this rack together, so I'm not sure how it will work out in my son's closet."
5,Great Space Saver!,I bought two of these a couple of months ago and they have definitely saved me the needed closet space. Great price and durability!...
4,How High is Your Closet's Hang Bar?,"As previously indicated in other reviews, this rack works well for hanging shorter items. Skirts, ladies shirts, pants (folded over a hanger). It is definitely worthwhile for my side of the closet, but my partner's Men's L & XL shirts reached the floor or got in the way of the bottom rung regardless of configuration. This is far better than other ""doublers"" I have tried, just be sure to measure the height of the bar you'll be hanging it from if you have particular clothing hanging needs.The metal construction seems durable and is able to hold quite a bit of weight. There was some rust/fade spots already showing through the chrome plating, but you get what you pay for and this is an inexpensive solution."
1,don't bother,This product is terrible - avoid. It isn't customizable to different heights - not enough anyway to make room for anything but very small clothes on top - short skirts perhaps.
3,Nice but small and flimsy,This is a nice product but it is too small (the top rack is too close to the bottom one) for adult clothing. I bought this item for my baby's closet and it fits his small clothes perfectly. It is a bit lightweight and it moves around when hanging or removing clothers from it.
2,Not worth the money.,This was very flimsy. The picture must be of toddler t-shirts as most of my clothes won't fit in it without hitting the bar. I have a doubler in my son's closet that was much more substantial. I didn't think this was worth the money. In the future I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it.
2,Will work for kids.,"Okay, look at the picture. Notice anything? Very small items hanging from the top rack. I wear 2x clothing and my wife is a size 4. She's tiny. Neither of our pants or shirts would hang above the lower rack or not drag the floor from the bottom rack. It does work for our 6 year old, but we have toy racks in his closet, and so we are sending it back. It got 2 stars because it was sturdy metal that won't sag with weight on it."
4,This is a nice solution to a small closet,"I use this in my son's closet. It has hooks for his belts, and he can reach his clothing so he is more independent."
2,Not so great,"In theory, this looks fantastic. And once you put it in your closet, it also seems like a great idea. And it is a great IDEA, but its a pain to actually use. The way it is made, it is very wobbly and doesnt stay in place. Basically, you have to have it just so, or it gets wonky, moves around and sometimes even falls off the rod. It would be great if the top and bottom actually screwed together making one rigid piece. But bascially the bottom rod just lays into the bottom, and it just shifts constantly.There are better made versions of this out there. We ended up chucking this and getting one at another local store. Because again, it is a fantastic way to get more space out of your closet, and especially good for kids clothes.So I gave it one 2-stars because this version stinks."
3,For Kids It's Good - Not For Adult Clothes,"I bought this for my closet, to make some more room.I don't hang up my pants, so I intended to use this to make 2 rows of my hang up jackets, shirts, etc. This does not work at all for this. My clothes are too long to do 2 rows with these dimensions, causing the bottom bar to push out and fall off. So, ended up using it to hang my kid's clothes, which fit within these specs."
3,Its alright..,"The closet doubler does what it says, it'll create a second bar in your closet under the first bar. Judging from the other reviews, it seem like it was made for kid's closets. I wish it was about an inch longer, as my shirts are a little bit too long, even though they're standard size shirts. Its pretty stable once you fill it with items. I should have paid attention to the dimensions of the product, but the price was cheap enough to get me to put up with it. I ordered two of these to go on either side of my walk in closet, but I've only been able to make enough space for one since a majority of my items are too long."
3,this is not enough book to give fpgee exam,i am pharmacist from india and now i am applying for fpgee exam and for that preparation i take this book this is good book which cover all ideas about exams questions but i think this is not only book enough for sucessful passing fpgee but this is good book for reading
3,Not Bad,"To be honest, I really didn't use this book to study from.....it's too comprehensive for the pharmacy boards...remember the board exam is just a minimum competencey exam...i actually bought it for the practice exams which are useful cause they not only give you the correct answer in the back but tell u why it is correct and why the other choices are not!! Don't get discouraged if you barely even get half of them right....they are again a little too comprehensive but they do a good job to steer u in the direction of topics that u probably overlooked. I suggest to take the 2 exams in the end as review.......u will appreciate the text book as a reference once u become a pharmamcist and want to brush up on a topic!! If your're wondering what text I used to study from it was the Kaplan text....it is geared for the boards and i guarantee u if u can get your hands on it (I had a friend who took the course and let me borrow the book) you'll be good to go!!!!"
4,Helpful for PEBC's,"I recently wrote the Canadian version of the pharmacy licencing exam - the PEBC's. I did find this book very helpful for studying because each section was laid out well and very clearly explains the important features of each disease and drug therapy. Unfortunately, it did not cover all the important topics. For example, cholesterol and lipids, GERD, and alcoholic liver disease weren't covered. But the topics that are covered are done very well and it makes a great addition to therapeutics notes.A caution for Canadians - I would recommend this book but beware of the fact that not all of the listed drugs are available here (nor are all our drugs listed in it) and that the questions in the samples and practice exams are not very representative. They are a great studying tool to see how much information you got from each section, just don't expect your exam to resemble them much."
2,NOT a comprehensive review!,"I really don't feel like this book is very comprehensive. For example, for a certain disease state they will list the MOA for one drug class, but not another. I guess a good way to sum up this book is INCOMPLETE. I'm studying for the California boards and this book is better than nothing, but everyone tells me Koda-Kimble is the way to study. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Comprehensive Pharmacy Review Practice Exams,The Practice exams were excellent.It is a practice in logical thinking that will no doubt be continued in their area of expertise.
4,A Book To Rely On,"""Comprehensive Pharmacy Review Exams"" book includes a wide variety of chapters that can answer your scientific questions. It can really help you get well prepared for pharmacy exams."
5,"Great product, and great value!","These radios are great, and come with everything you need, including rechargable batteries, and charger. They have the codes that allow you to ignore other users on the same frequency, and a lock function that prevents you from accidentally changing frequency. They DO NOT revert back to the default setting when charged, and you CAN use them while they are in the charger, unlike what the previous reviewer said. The only thing I can think of is that they let the batteries drain completely, and then charged it, which would explain it losing the frequency setting and not being able to be used.In short, a great product. These radios have a much further range than a 2.4 GHz cordless phone, in case you were curious. They are great for families to keep in touch while out at the mall or at the park."
2,Extraordianry series - poor picture quality,"First I'd like to say that I think that Twin Peaks isgreat. However, the poor picture quality that these episode collection tapes have is pathetic. They are recorded with Long Play and therefore have a very blurry/defocused picture ..."
5,Great!,This is a great collection of short stories. Mr. Gaines is a superb talent. I have never been disappointed by anything he has ever written! One of my favorite authors!
1,Don't Bother,"Both of these are five-star discs singularly. Together, they're a disaster. The record company that put out this CD made some egregious cuts in ""Swingin' New Big Band"" to make it fit on a disc with ""Keep The Customer Satisfied,"" and left this customer completely dissatisfied. Longtime Buddy Rich fans know this material backwards and forwards and can't be fooled. Buy them separately."
2,OLD,"Don't be fooled, this is simply a Kindle version of an article written in 1882. Do not waste your time unless you want a history lesson in training dogs."
1,"Not really ""reusable"" stickers as the cover claims","The cover says these are reusable stickers.... they are not! They are less sticky, so yes, you can pull them up and lay them back down once or twice at best. Total rip off and way overpriced for ""75 stickers""The Melissa and Doug Reusable Vinyl sticker book is a far better value for the same price.If your looking for just stickers, I recommend the Thomas Sticker Express (Super Stickerific) which has 700+ stickers which are high quality. I'm not 100% sure if Golden Books makes another 700+ sticker book like this one in other themes, but I sure hope so because this Thomas book is awesome.http://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Habitats-Reusable-Sticker/dp/B004PBN9BC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1358907950&sr;=8-1&keywords;=melissa+and+doug+reusable+sticker+padandhttp://www.amazon.com/THOMAS-STICKER-EXPRESS-Friends-Stickerific/dp/0375841261/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid;=1358906854&sr;=8-6&keywords;=thomas+the+train+coloring+book"
4,the Uniques,love this oldie - brings back the good old days of high school ! Glad to see it's still around and available
2,Where is the imagination?,"I was looking for some good erotica and found this. From the previous reviews, it seemed interesting. Well, lo and behold, I received the book and found it lacking in imagination and full of poor writing. If I wasn't in another country I'd send it back. What garbage."
2,love Kelly Willis - could not wait to hear her Christmas music,been a fan of Kelly Willis for a long time so I was delighted to learn she had out a Christmas CD - sorry to say it did not live up to my expectations - too singer / songwriter for my taste - this is also a duet album with her husband Bruce Robison - all in all in probably works for those who love singer/songwriter type stuff but this is too drab in production for my tatste
4,Worked like a dream....,The paper was heavy duty. The ice didn't melt the papers. It help everything in place with little mess. Would recommend and buy again.
2,NOT the product shown !,"These sno cone cups are NOT the ones they show, nor are they ""heavy duty"" as described. They are slightly thicker than a kleenex, and certainly NOT dry wax coated for durability. I will definately have to use 2 for each sno cone. VERY disapointed."
5,Perfect,These cups are perfect for snow cones but the one thing that bothers me is that you have to be holding them all the time!These cups can't stand up on a table but are still really awesome!!!!!
3,snow cone cups,"They advertise these cups as heavy.....I expected a heavier cup. Was a bit dissatisfied, but they did there job, although rather flimsy."
5,Moses Speaks!,"Heston has given us some of the greatest movies ever made. Who can deny he is among the greatest actors ever produced in America? His book is an interesting Bio and gives the reader a lot of insight into the Golden era of film making. Imagine yourself behind the scenes on the set of Ten Commandants, Ben Hur, 55 Days at Peking, El Cid. Heston takes you there in his own formable style and wit. You will enjoy the story as you have taken pleasure in his movie career. Unfortunately left leaning Hollywood has ostracized him in later years for his stand on liberty, but always a man of great principle, Chuck has stuck to his beliefs and continues to influence millions of young Americans with the truth. We can all be thankful for an actor of his caliber and character."
4,Insightful Autobiography,"Charlton Heston's memoir tells of his childhood, adolescence and the behind the scenes stories of his legendary acting career. An interesting read about the Golden Age of film making, and how a shy boy became one of the most accomplished actors of all time."
5,Attractive and durable,"I bought this for my 10 year old several months ago - it is a very attractive, colorful carrier for his cards. He does not use it around his neck, but carries it in his backpack with lots of other supplies and books. After many months, this case is still functional and in good shape - it does have a couple of nicks in the paint - it keeps his (very expensive) cards in good shape!!"
3,Perfect for carrying YuGiOh cards around with!,"On my way to my friends YuGiOh tournament, I used this. It feels comfy around your neck and doesn't break."
4,The Latter Pieces of Coward's Style,"This is a hugely subjective autobiography, penned by one of the most legendary playwright/lyricist/ composer/ entertainer combinations of the last century. For scholars and devotees of Coward's life experiences and his wittly elegant use of vocabulary and phraseology: it is highly valuable. Also of note are Coward's individualistic, personal turn of phrase and the inclusion of persnal habits and mannerisms of daily living: writing, sitting down to tea, fashion, dressing,social graces and vast friendships. To find more of the legendary playwright's private life and what exactly inspired him to write, other objective biographies need to be consulted."
1,Not worth it!,"Bought one of these about a year ago and the speaker phone portion has always been terrible to unusable. Today, however, I realized that the MUTE doesn't work! How many conference calls have I been on in the last year and thought I was muted when I wasn't? Don't buy this phone."
1,Good out of the package - bad over time,"All memory is battery dependent. If the phone get accidently unplugged from the power outlet, the battery dies fast and you lose all your directory info ans speed dial settings. And, my phone refuses to recognize new good batteries."
2,Display Contrast Makes It Difficult to Read,"If you plan on using caller ID, look elsewhere.Despite how I adjust the screen contrast, its difficult to read who is calling. ...pretty much useless.Other than that, it's your typical corded phone. Nothing special."
2,Worked Great at First - Then Problems Started,"I've owned this phone for a few years, and was initially happy with it. But after a while, problems started creeping up.The first issue was that the ""Replace Battery"" message would continue to appear, even when the backup batteries were replaced. The second problem was that the screen would occasionally light up, and the phone would promptly ""reboot"" and delete all of the saved information and incoming calls. I'd have to go back through and reprogram everything.The final and biggest problem is that I eventually couldn't hear anything through the receiver. The speakerphone would continue to work, and people could hear me speaking, but the audio would simply drop out two minutes into a phone call. Now I'll have to buy a new phone, although I may think twice about buying RCA if their other products have similar technical issues."
1,Don't buy it!,Used for less than a month. The handset stopped working. The only way to answer the call was via speakerphone. Sent it back and received a refund. Looking for a replacement.
1,Junk,"It is a shame that this product is still being sold and that RCA has not removed it from the market place. As per other purchasers, I am on my THIRD replacement and now out of warranty. Every one of the phones reverted to the ""initializing"" state and erased all memory. ""Initializing"" ran on a continuous basis. I never should have got rid of my old AT&T; I thought that I was upgrading to the newest and greatest. I will never purchase another RCA product of any sort!"
1,Annoying! Poor UI design.,"The bright blue backlit LCD display turns on every 30 minutes. This is a huge problem if you have the phone in your bedroom. There is setting to change the backlight but the only options are ""auto"" (every 30 min) or ""always on"" which is no better!When a missed call comes in, regardless of whether you press 'Exit' or 'Delete' to ignore it the 'new call' light still shows up. In fact, when I answer a call and hang up it shows 'new call' for the call I just answered!The controls for navigating and selecting menu items are frustrating and the speakerphone creates a terrible echo.Generally it works as a phone, but if you just want a phone there are better options for the price."
4,"Good Price, 7-10 day delivery","This model is not as readily available as they have a new model out. The price was lower by $40 from the original one I bought 8 months ago. 7 - 10 day no-cost delivery. I like this unit because it accepts two seperate lines with caller ID on both. I do not have a business phone system, but seperate phone lines coming in. Works good for us."
1,"3 phones, all had the same problems","1. Message cuts off after a few seconds. You have to replay the message over and over again to hear as much of it as possible.2. Answering machine dies after a few months. It appears to lock up. Outgoing personal message gets erased, default message isn't there either. It won't answer incomming calls and you can't re-record another message.3. Confusing button layout on base.No this isn't user error or static discharges either. Stay clear of this!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"This phone looks good but does not work at all. I have returned 2 of these phones, and the 3rd one they sent to me doesn't work either! The handset buzzes when you talk into it, the time and date randomly stop working, now I can't dial out. I give up! I am looking for a new phone. After returning 2 of them I have no more time to invest returning the 3rd one and will throw this piece of junk in the garbage! I have avoided RCA products because of past trouble with their TV's, and this phone confirms me NEVER purchasing another RCA product again! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"
1,Not a great phone. It's going back.,"This is a well designed, attractive phone with nice features like separate headset and speaker buttons. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, sound quality is only fair to poor. Frankly, I'm surprised that RCA would put its name on such a low quality instrument. I'd gladly pay more for a high quality home office speakerphone, but I haven't yet found one. I do not recommend this phone."
1,Interference is a huge problem...,"I've got to admit that I liked this phone quite a bit for it's functionality and design. For the most part, the phone worked quite well...when it was working. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the other reviews, interference seems to be a huge issue with this phone. Data activity on my Blackberry Curve (T-Mobile) kept causing this phone to go crazy. It would simply erase all of my addressbook entries and the settings. I've tried calling RCA/Thompson about it, but they don't seem to think that it is an issue with their phone at all. They had a few suggestions for me, but none of them seemed to have fixed the problem. I tried all of their suggestions on 2 of these phones.I'm going to have to pass on this phone for sure!"
5,MARTIN'S BEST!,"Cruel Shoes is Steve Martin's best book, without a doubt. It's a collection of short stories, some only a paragraph long, and you might be lucky enough to get a copy with illustrations of him tormented over his typewriter, empty alcohol bottles and balled up paper strewn around the room. It makes no pretense of having any social value, besides that it's just funny. It's pure comedy, it's ludocrusy, irony, and surrealism. Buy a copy, they can get you one, and maybe you'll help it get back into print."
4,funny and absurd,"There are some classic chapters in here, including the title story and ``How to Fold Soup.'' The sort of humour in Cruel Shoes is a rawer version of what one now sees in Martin's New Yorker pieces; I prefer it. Martin is a master of writing wry, funny, hopelessly unsubtle comedy."
2,CRUEL STEVE,"I love Steve Martin. I think he's a brilliant, witty, philosophical and totally entertaining writer. I guess that's why I was disappointed in this book. The stories are ok, but certainly not the quality of most of his other writing. Great cover pic, however!"
3,Funny Man,"Atlanta, Georgia- Cruel Shoes by Steve Martin seems to be a collection of bits that either were performed on stage or in his mind's eye.As to what to say when the ducks show up. That's easy say, ""oh ducks, oh ducks, oh ducks."" How to get out of bed, well simply get up.Another is how to deal with trouble cows. These renegade cows open the door with mischief. Lesson given, ""Don't fool with renegade cows"".Cruel Shoes by Steve Martin will have you giggling with the insane humor of this deep philosophical comedian.He dedicates his book: ""To the audience, without whom I would only be myself""."
1,The Worst of Steve Martin,"I love Steve Martin's stand-up and movies, but his writing is hit or miss for me. Neither jokes nor stories, Cruel Shoes is a collection of abstract incomplete thoughts that don't amount to much more than a couple flashes of cleverness. On the other hand, it takes a slow reader like me 30 minutes to get through and it is available used from $1.29, so if you're a Steve Martin fan and you want to check it out, you don't have much to lose.Just when I was ready to write off Steve Martin as a writer, I picked up his two most recent books (Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company) and liked them a lot. The Pleasure of My Company is actually funny, and Shopgirl is interesting without really being funny. I would recommend those instead of or in addition to Cruel Shoes."
3,"Demented & Stupid, Also Hilariously Entertaining","This book is very much like Martin's stand-up material, except that he seems to have swallowed a great deal of acid. Check it out."
1,Lowbrow and Dumb,I like Steve Martin but this book is just plain awful. Lowbrow and extremely stupid in both it's concept and delivery.
2,Where's the beef?,"I ordered this book on the strength of reviews by other therapists (I am not a therapist myself but have undergone a fair amount over the years). I was disappointed. Rutledge seems unable to maintain a clear focus on his theme of overcoming and embracing fear. Instead, the reader must sift through an almost stream-of-consciousness exposition that meanders off into general therapeutic theories, anecdotes about Rutledge's clients that don't seem to illustrate his points (if you can locate them), and far too many non sequiturs about his own recovery process and the comments of his wife. Maybe there is useful information in this book, but I found myself far too impatient with the author's disconnected psychobabble to want to look very hard for it."
5,A must have for the vinyl edition,"Well, what can I say?I bought the vinyl edition way back in 1980 something and only thought to search for the CD version a couple of weeks ago. This is the album for anyone who loves great instrumentals and quirky art. The story book is a little difficult to read due to the tiny print but this is a small thing (no pun intended) as the music and art far exceed expectations. I was instantly thrown back to the 80s as soon as the first track started.The music follows a great story line of creation and destruction of a planet and the mood is powerful.I strongly recommend this album to be enjoyed and savoured for what it is, A WORK OF ART.............Dave"
2,Noodles,"Considering the elaborate packaging, this project by Patrick Woodruffe and Dave Greenslade comes off as oddly sterile, particularly as regards Greenslade's soundtrack. Ostensibly a collaboration, the latent profundity of the Cosmogeny is undercut not only by the loose story's lack of originality (Tolkien and Peake at least had a sense of humor) but the noodly music is curiously detached from its supposed subject, as if the two had nothing in common. What humor the unengaging music occasionally does try so hard to convey is inappropriate, as the book itself lends such an air of arch Cosmic Seriousness. Combined, the two give the overall project an air of treacly preciousness. But then, maybe that's the point."
1,Save your money -,"I bought these radios so I could keep track of my son when he was outside playing. They never reached two miles, first of all. And he is rough, so that may account for how ""beat up"" they got soon after we got them. They drain batteries like I don't know what. We had to change them (4 per radio) every week, it seemed, even if we only used the radios on the weekends. For the price I paid for them, I could have just added a few more dollars and bought a better pair that can be recharged. That's what I'm doing now and what I suggest others do before wasting the $40 on these."
4,"A Throwback To The Days Of ""After The Eulogy""","This album, albeit a bit more disjointed than ""Tomorrow Comes Today"", is excellent! Chad's guitar has never been better, especially on the mellower intervals that tie the songs together, and of course, Nathan's vocals are as fantastic as ever. Highlights are ""So Long... And Thanks For The Crutches"", ""Empire"", and the very end of ""A Far Cry"", which is a new version of ""Still Waiting For The Punchline"", from ""After The Eulogy"". All in all, this album is superb!"
4,Wanderlust,The book was very good. Another great story line from Danielle Steel. Don't know how she comes up with so many story lines to keep her readers interests.
5,Absolutely Great!,"Danielle Steel did it again! One of the best books of hers I have read so far. She did a wonderful job taking you back to that time. This book has it all...talks about family, travel, love, death, war and survival. Great read!!"
5,A DANIELLE STEEL Classic,"Danielle STEEL has once again outdone herself... I read this book about five years ago and thought that it was one of the best works Danielle has come up with. The storyline about sibling rivalry was very realistic and the ""urge to roam"" feelings described were right on the money. I could relate very easily with the characters and I consider this a MASTER-PIECE CLASSIC"
4,Enjoyed this book,It kept my interest till the end and I found it to be a little different from her other books.
5,I JUST LOVE IT.....,Danielle Steel always make me get deep into her books and imagine every place and people in her books and this is no different!! ¡Me encanta!
5,an obession,this is the best book I've ever read. it pulled so much emotion out of me - from tears to joy. I could not put it down - it was like the obession I never had. I wanted it to go on and on yet I had to know the ending. If ever I wanted a squeal...
3,A young woman finds love where she never thought it would be,"Audrey Driscoll is the oldest child. Audrey and Annabelle Driscoll parents died on a ship when Audrey was eleven and Annabelle was seven. They go to live with their grandfather. From the get go Audrey takes care of her sister and grandfather. She manages his household, their servants, and helps with business. She gets her one and only desire, which is to travel. On her cruise she meets the love of her life. The problem is his job calls for him to travel and go all around the world. Audrey feels she should be at home with her family. She throws caution to the wind and goes off with him against her original plans. She stays in one place while he goes back to work. He has asked her to marry him and she says no. Through it all they get together. I love this book it is a great choice."
1,Great movie but aweful DVD,"I have a fond memory on this film. I couldn't wait for this to be released on Blu-ray format, so, bought this one.Picture looks like it was transferred from VHS that was recorded on LP format if you know what I mean. Watching the DVD, all I could say was... W T F????"
5,Trinity,I like the Trinity series. This had pretty good quality compared to the older ones. I do recommend it for anyone that has an interest for this series.
5,Trinity movie,I saw this movie years ago and really enjoyed it. I took it over to share with my folks and they enjoyed it too.
3,Fun but not the best peeler,"This is a fun item for people with children, but it is not the best peeler. It would not be suitable either to allow young children to use it - but for a bit of whimsy in the kitchen it is a fun item."
5,Lotsa Fun!,"nice adorable gadget, fun enough to display and not hide away in drawer, blade is of highest quality, sharp and fast, easy to hold in your hand.Love it!S.F."
1,"I want my finger back, monkey!","POOR design all around... yes, it is very cute, but the placement of the blade (unlike all traditional peelers) leaves your fingers in very precarious positions. Also, there is TOO much give in the blade, making peeling a chore more easily conquered with a butcher knife.Last night, while peeling a jicama, I lost most of my pinky nail, and a large portion of the skin underneath it. Please don't buy this for your children to help with cooking, unless you like fingerless kiddos..."
3,Its the Script to the Movie,"This is the script to the movie Barfly. It was a bit awkward for me to read something in script form. Its full of all the Bukowski cliches and there are a few laughs. Not that this is bad but I'd recomend Bukowski's Hollywood which is his account of the making of the Barfly movie, and even watching the film before I would reading the script. Really this is probably only worth your trouble if your a Bukowski completist."
2,not the best,"I LOVE lara fabian, and although this cd is good, it's nothing compared to her others (specifically 'Pure' and 'Nue'). If i had listened to this cd first, i might feel differently but it's just kind of a letdown after the others which are SO good in my opinion. A few of the songs are more pop-y and I don't think the style suits her. All in all though, she still has an amazing voice and I'm glad i bought this."
5,Welcome to the clouds of heaven.,"What a voice, do I like other artist better?...yes a few, but is there another voice so soft but yet so bold? I have yet to find one. There are enough reviews here, so I'll make this short. Don't know french? Neither do I! I say the following about Lara and no one else ""it's like an angel is singing to me."" So heavenly her voice floats on hypnotizing you. But when she wants to let you know something, she strikes with such thunder your eyes go wide! Lara you truly are heaven sent. I will always support you Lara!"
3,Lara Fabian,I am enjoying most of the CD. Personally I feel there was too much rock in some of the songs. Not that there is anything wrong with rock. I have been listening to Led Zeplin and Pink Floyd for 30 plus years. I was expecting the music to be more mellow. Ms. Fabian has a wonderful voice. I enjoy listening to to most of her songs.
4,500 Poker Chip Set,"I really like the poker chips I bought. The set comes with 500 chips, 2 decks of cards, and the dealer and blind chips. The only thing that is slightly negative about the purchase is that the case is a little flimsier than I expected. Other than that, the product is great and the service was great. I got my order faster than I expected and I got a great deal on the item."
3,Case broken upon arrival,"As many other reviewers have said, the case arrived to me in mangled condition. The handle was falling off, the hinges were broken, and the there was another piece also falling off. The chips were in fine condition and the insert/organizer was not the cheap plastic that some have reviewed but made of wood and covered. The chips are not the best I've ever seen but they have a good weight and for the price are as good or better than one would expect.I contacted Amazon about the broken case and they promptly sent out another set. This was a Christmas gift and fortunately I had ordered it with enough time to spare that the replacement made it on time. The replacement had a few minor dents in it, but was in acceptable shape. If you are thinking about ordering this for a gift, make sure you allow enough time to send for a replacement, which yes, is a pain, but all in all this is a great deal."
2,Well...,"Well..the other reviews don't lie. Not the best set, you really get what you pay for. The chips seem to be hit or miss. I didn't even have to open all the rows, one of the rows was partly open from shipping. Just looking at the packaged stacks and few loose chips is all I really needed. They are very hit or miss, mostly miss. I'm not sure why, but they all have this odd gray'ish hue to them, even the white ones. It is hard to describe, they feel like they need to be washed and sanded. I tried rinsing the loose ones I had off, but it didn't seem to do anything. If you've played with higher quality sets, you will probably be able to tell the difference.It may catch your eye with its low price, but after consideration, the manufacturing standards presented in this set are simply too low to overcome and I've decided to return.I left it with 2 stars because if you are not picky and price is all the matters, then they may work for you. But don't say you weren't warned."
2,Missing a red chip,"The box (suit case) was short 1 red chip.... that's incredibly annoying The inside of the case is also built really crappy. The particle board (it wasn't wood) that creates different pockets for the different colored chips was stapled together, except half of the staples missed the mark, and a good portion of the inner slates were too short so there's viable gaps. Long story short, I got annoyingly giped 1 red chip and it's assembled poorly"
2,So So,"The chips and the box are both nice, however the cards are very cheap, and there were no dealer chip. no big blind no small blind chips."
4,Great Set For Recreational Player,"This set is perfect for recreational poker players. The chips have a nice feel and sound great when thrown into the pot. The playing cards that come with set will not last more than a couple of hours in a regular game. The position buttons are good touch, I am glad they included them with the set. The aluminum case is not very sturdy and is not well constructed. If you are looking for a good container for the chips, this case will disappoint you. I purchased this set only for the chips and for the price they are great. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating was because a few of the chips were damaged (3) they were chipped and stained. I liked the set so much I ordered another. I store them in a clear 1000 chip holder. It looks great and presents well."
4,Good bargin for an albeit cheap set,"The set comes in an aluminium box. My box had a number of scratches and dings in it when I recevied it, so if you plan to purchase this as a present for someone, be warned that it may arrive in second hand looking condition.The latches on the case come with a cheap lock on each. The case makes the storage easy, and works well enough for the intended purpose. Two decks of cards inside are paper with plastic coating, not unlike Bicycle cards. They wear out after a few games. If you plan on using the set often, I would recommend getting a set of 100% plastic cards (Copag is really good):Copag Poker Size Regular Index 1546 Playing Cards (Blue Red Setup)Overall, the set is cheap and looks it. However, the price is really good, and as a way to improve your home game at minimal cost, this set will work well. I would recommend this set purely on the basis of the price."
3,500 chips? How about 497...,"The case containing the chips are fine, the dealer and blind buttons are fine, and the chips are also fine. HOWEVER, this set is short one white chip per stack, which is kinda crappy. The white chips, usually used as lower value chips, are the ones that are used most; which means I need all of them. BUT, I'll make due. But for 37$ I would expect all the pieces to at least be intact."
4,Packaging vs Customer Service,"As soon as I opened the box, I saw that the case was cracked. It's obvious how it got cracked so easily when such a heavy product was protected with only butcher paper. Everything inside the case was okay, so I wasn't that angry. I sent an email about this problem and they immediately responded. They gave me options that were acceptable. So all I have to say is that be careful about ordering this SPECIFIC product, on the other hand, they offer VERY polite and fast customer service, so I'm sure their other lighter products should be a safer buy."
3,Poor packaging,This would probably be a great product but the packaging was horrible and ruined the case almost completely. Transporting the chips are very difficult without a solid case. There was nothing done to protect the case during shipping and it sustained too much damage for proper use.
1,Very Unhappy,"I was very unhappy with this purchase, and if I didn't have a poker tournament a few days after the product arrived, I would have returned it.Pros -- The price is very low, the chips have a good weight to them, the two different colored card decks are nice, the BB SB and Dealer buttons are of good quality, the case is lockable.Cons -- When the case arrived it had many dents in it, I was missing 3 white chips, the color on the chips are faded, a lot of the chips have little burs sticking off of them, the chips aren't the same width I was able to make a stack 9 thicker chips (with burs) almost as tall as a stack of 10 chips.I guess I got what I paid for. The biggest disappointment was the missing white chips. I don't think I will be buying from this manufacturer again."
3,VERY heavy,"This appears to be a high-quality set, however as others have mentioned the metal case is flimsy and arrived dented. I was surprised that there is even a lock on this with keys, so if you need to stash ca$h this is great! It is very heavy and would be perfect for a large crowd. A smaller set would have be adequate, however it was not found when shopping on amazon. I would recommend it if you need lots of poker chips and a place to store them."
4,I only have 1 issue: residue on chips,"I've purchased chips like this before, and there is always a residue on them when you first open the box. I don't think it's something you can avoid with clay chips. Everything else is great."
1,Heavy duty case......NOT!!!,"I recieved the item 2 days after the estimated delivery date with a broken case,they said that it has a Heavy duty case,NOT, case is very flimsy like cardboard.Chips were all dusty that I have to wash it and dry.I do not reccomend anyone getting this item."
3,chips have holes,"we received a set that looks like the coating didnt make it all the way around the metal plate inside the chip and the chip looks like it has a hole. functionally, it's fine, but i would have appreciated a set without holes."
3,good purchase,"Chips have good quality, and the case is perfect, protects chips and you can lock it with keys. But one problem: as i am buying a 500 chips set, i was expecting to receive colors in multiple of 50 pieces. But I received 49 black chips and 201 red chips (plus 150 blue and 100 green). I can play and use it normally, but i didn't like this mistake."
4,Great Quality Set!,This is a fantastic set! VERY heavy in a good way! Only reason why I rate this a 4 out of a 5 is just because of the care of shipping. They stuffed it in a very large box with minimal padding. So the bottom of the poker case received a good gauge/crack/hole... other then that I would recommend this set!
2,Do Not Buy,"From the price and picture this product seems like a good buy...stop there! Not only was the case and the felt insert broken and poorly made (cardboard), but the chips are terribly made. The printing on the chips is off and messy. I have one white chip that has red markings all over it that will not wash off. The paint on the chips is sloppy and does not look good.For the seller I could not find a way to contact you but I am requesting a better case and, at least, a replacement white chip for the one that is tainted with red. I am very upset with the comparison of the quality you say this set is and its actual quality. Please respond to me a litrenta94@aol.com when you decide to send me the requested items.I gave this item 2 stars simply because of the extremely fast shipping and delivery time :)"
2,Broken!,"This set of chips looks nice online, but not quite as nice in real life. The box it cam in was huge, too big for the case of chips, I'm not sure if that's what led to the case breaking by the time I got it, or if it was just shipped broken. It came with 2 decks of cards and all of the chips mentioned when ordering it, but the wooden interior of the case is too large for all the chips, and slightly broken because the metal outer case is broken. The metal clasps on the outside of the case don't quite fit together correctly, also because it was broken when I got it. I WOULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 0, MAYBE A 1, BUT I FORCED MYSELF TO PUSH IT UP TO A 2; SOLELY BECAUSE I REALLY ONLY NEEDED THE CHIPS, AND IT HAS ALL OF THEM AND CAME IN JUST A FEW DAYS!"
4,Very Nice,These chips are casino quality... with the exception of values being printed on each chip... That would make it a 5 star review.
3,taxgal,"It was not exactly what I thought I was getting. I had purchased 2 other cases of chips elsewhere that had monetary denominations marked on each chip. In all fairness to the vendor, they didn't show pictures of the face of the chips and I assumed they would all be marked as well. I didn't have time to return them before our party so I had to use them as is."
4,Great chips/Horrible Case,"I must concur with many of the previous reviews. The chips are heavy and good quality. The case was damaged and bent upon receipt. Having read the reviews I knew to expect this and did not bother to return the case. Overall, for the price I still feel like the chips are worth it."
3,"Okay set overall, but case is cheaply made.","I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my husband and am not as happy with it as I had hoped. The chips, cards, etc... are of good quality, but the carrying case is another story. It is cheaply made of a VERY thin metal that bends very easily. I would still recommend this product, given that the price is very good for a large poker set, however, be aware that you might choose to purchase a better quality case, as we will certainly be doing."
2,Neat seller.,"Horrible product. Some of the worst workmanship I've ever seen.- Case was bent on one edge and the lid barely fits anymore (locking is an issue depending on the way you close it)- The metal is far too thin (see above) and I'm afraid to hold it by it's handle for fear of it breaking in half.- One of the metal corner-pieces was already fallen off by the time it got to my door.- The tray is held together by some sort of staples...the divider between the cards and button-holder was already broken, again, by the time it got to my door (Hell...ALL of these problems happened by the time it got to my door)+ At the very least, the quality of the chips and amount you get of them makes it somewhat okay. That said, I wouldn't have bought it if I knew the case would be of such poor quality...should have listened to the other reviewers.I would NOT reccomend you buy this if your looking for a poker set - get something a bit higher quality."
4,"Buy for the chips, pitch the case","It's been said before, but the reason to buy this is for the chips. The dyes are dark and they feel right when shuffled.Everything else can get tossed. The cards are, of course, garbage. The button and LB/BB buttons are pretty standard.The case is not very well made. It is actually a little too big for the chips. I personally don't like when there is space for extra chips in a row. They slide too much when you carry them."
3,"OK Quality, not impressed","For the price it is good but the quality of the box and cards is very poor. Chips feel heavy and makes good sound when ""played with"". Shipping was fast and Amazon is best place to buy as always."
2,Poor case,"When I received this poker chip set, I was shocked to see how bad the case was. Once the case was opened; it took me a good 5 minutes to close it back. The lid was very unstable; and would not close properly. The case is very cheap. If you are buying this; for sure you will be looking for a new case after a few use."
3,You get what you pay for.,"This was a gift for my son's 12th birthday. We researched the poker sets for days and this one looked like a great deal. The package arrived two days before his birthday and when I opened the package I was immediately dissapointed in the case. The contents were fine but the case was put together very poorly and did not close correctly. I had to manipulate some of the metal around the edges so they would not cut anyone. If I had time to return it before his party I would have. Not happy with case, okay with chips and cards."
3,"Chips are good as per my expectations, the case is not so good.",Chips quality as per my expectations. The Aluminum case provided is really bad quality. First one was broken while shipping I had to return and get another one. When I lift the case with all the chips loaded it feels like the handle is going be break.
2,Low quality of both chips and case,"Chips quality is rather low - the colors are not as bright as expected, all chips are somewhat greyish. The chips only come in 4 colors, while normally 5 colors are expected. The aluminum case is very cheap - only its frame seems made of aluminum, but the outer sufrace feels more like thin plastic and came cracked in multiple places."
1,Disgusted,"This Product was not what I was expecting at all. The carrying case is falling apart, and you can tell that it was made very cheaply! Not worth the price! I have seen cheaper sets with much better quality than this one. I am very disappointed!!!"
2,Very disappointed!!!,"Opened the package as soon as it was delivered, all the colors were really faded. Looked like these chips were 15 years old not brand new. I was willing to live with the colors being faded but as I started playing poker the same night I found at least 10 chips that had chips out of them where I could see the bare metal. Almost every single one had scratches and just in general poorly made. A stack of 10 chips doesn't even stack evenly. To say the least this was the worst purchase I've ever made on amazon, very disappointed!! The only reason it gets 2 stars is the price"
4,Heavy duty chips,"Got these chips to replace the quarter size plastic ones we have been using. Love the heft of these guys. The different colors enhance the playability. It's just more fun to play with these ""real"" chips."
4,"Great Product, Great Price",I recieved this chips with the Super Saver Shipping which makes them a great deal for the selling price.There are a few burrs on some of the chips but are easily removed. Great product great feel during the game.My Texas Holdem games are much more realistic and the clan loves to play with these chips.
4,Love these!,"The chips were sent in a box that was way too big. As a result the metal case is dented a a few different spots; however, the chips are professional grade. Comes with a key if you have a need to lockup your chips...Also comes with two decks of cards, which are good enough for young kids at best...Bottom Line: these Poker Chips are fatastic! Very heavy!"
1,Very Poor Quality,I read the reviews and decided to take a chance; I wish I hadn't. The outside of the case had several dents and one of the feet was cracked. The case wasn't able to stay open; it kept closing on us. The felt lining had 2 one inch tears and several smaller tears. We didn't take the chips out of their sleeves but saw that one of the chips on an end was dimpled and the coating/paint was chipped.I would be embarrassed to have people over and play with these chips.
5,Perfect,Heavy box but Great product and price as expected. WIll definately be in use every time theres a game that needs chips.
3,Bit of a flaw,"This was a gift for a couple with whom we play cards since we were tired of lugging our set to their house (this sucker is heavy). Actually heaviness is a plus since the chips have a nice feel to them. The cards included could be a little better quality - we went out and bought a couple of decks of heavy duty plastic cards. The flaw was that when we inspected it before we gave it to them, the felt holding the pieces was cut quite badly and if it wasn't for the hastle, we would have returned it but we just switched our felt with the new set before we gave it to them. Lousy quality control for the money."
1,Don't be misled by 3.5 stars,"I thought 3.5 stars weren't bad, given how many reviews there were. I was dead wrong. The set I received was poorly packaged (by AMAZON!) and one of the feet was assembled off-center. Worst part, the chips inside were not close to what was pictured on Amazon. Yes, you get white, red, green and black; however the white portions of ALL chips were a drab, grayish color. I have a travel set on-hand to compare with, and the whites were night and day. The dice imprint was off the mark in many cases, and the chips themselves appeared to be of poor quality. You will be very disappointed if you order these. I immediately re-boxed and returned."
3,Cheap and poorly made,"This set is what you can expect with it being one of the cheaper options out there. It will serve it's purpose, but I am going to save up and buy some high quality chips in the future. The case is poorly made. It is coming apart around the edges and the interior dividers are pulled apart exposing the nails used to hold them together. The fabric of the dividers sheds and leaves a black powdery substance on everything. The clasps are flimsy and I'm concerned that if I lock them I won't be able to get the case open again. The chips are rough and jagged around the edges and several have botched paint jobs. The cards also smell like cigarette smoke which leads me to believe that their factory in China was filled with heavy smokers. This set is sub-par and you truly get what you pay for."
2,"Chips OK, Case is TERRIBLE","The chips are just ok. If you don't know what you are looking for in a poker chip you probably will not notice the uneven cut or feel to these chips. The case came dented and some of the rivets were bending, with the case cracking around them. This case was advertised to ""last a lifetime"" - yeah right!"
1,Just don`t buy it,"i give this product one star because it`s the minimum, terrible product, the chips where dirt, the briefcase was broken, becaus it`s not aluminium it's like corrugated cardboard with some paint. the briefcase came with the dice space not the blinds space. Don`t buy this product, it`s a waste of money"
1,only for people who prefer price over quality,"after reading some good reviews on this set I was surprised to get a product with so many flaws:1. Aluminum case came with a dented frame2. Interior of case looks very cheap3. The chips barely fit in their niches, dealer and blind buttons don't fit into their niches4. overall it feels as if the case wasn't made for these chips5. black chips stack a bit higher then rest of the chips (starting to be noticable at 10 chips in a stack)i called amazon and they sent me a replacement set which was even in worse condition than the first one in all respectsended up returning both sets to amazon for full refunddidn't even open the cards so i don't know what their condition wasbesides the issue with the black chips, the chips themselves are okay, but i wouldn't say they were high quality"
1,"A chip short, twice","The chips are decent, but the set only had 499 chips, not 500. It's short one of the white ones. Now my only option appears to be return the whole (really heavy) thing, or just put up with the shortage. Weak quality control on this product.Received replacement. It's also a chip short, and the case was damaged in shipment. My bad for not hanging on to the original until the replacement arrived. I could have had a full set with undamaged case. I returned this one too, for a refund. (Sure glad I bought that Prime membership!)Saw identical chips at the nearest Target store, which is 40 miles away, last night. They're similarly low priced. I'm going to buy there instead just so that Amazon doesn't have to eat any more returns and I can do an on-the-spot quality check.Amazon was great about the returns."
2,Disappointed,"Do not buy this set. The price looks good, but you get what you pay for. Mine arrived and looked good at first, but it became clear that the case is absolute junk. There was a hole in it, I assume from where a screw was supposed to be. Although it looks like metal, it's actually cardboard, inside and out! The painting on the chips is inconsistent, and the whole kit smells like cigarette smoke. If I wasn't hosting a big tournament this week I would have returned it. Absolute garbage."
4,good for the price,Poker chips are nice...pretty good value for the price...the case is decent...not extremely sturdy but does the job...would recommend thisproduct..
2,poor quality,this product is poor quality the paint is sloppy and the chip weight is wrong I'm keeping them because I don't have time to get more very displease with this product
5,Perfect for what I was looking for,"I ordered this to use in teaching my (4) sons how to play blackjack without taking their allowance. For the price I was expecting something almost throw away but that is not this product at all. The chips are solid and well made and the case is pretty well constructed, stores easily and is segmented well for the chips and cards. My family has already enjoyed it very much and I would highly reccomend it for the price."
1,Not received yet,"I am still waiting for my purchase and I have thus not received it yet, so can not review the item. Sorry."
2,There's more to transpersonal therapy than this,"I was intrigued by the title in a bookstore and picked up this text. I'll keep it on my shelf but I am disappointed.The author covers a a wide ground which I expected in such a book. He obviously has clinical skill and is making sense of his work in a consistent way.My biggest disappointment was his most common choice of intervention - the Course in Miracles. It seemed to me that most of his interventions were crafted around this text - having the patient read the C in M, and so forth. There's more to transpersonal psychotherapy than this. Interested readers might be better served by Nelson's ""Healing the Split"" or the work of the Grofs or some of the new energy techniques (e.g., Gallo)."
2,Movie decent. Description needed clarity!,There are two different versions for this movie and my only disappointment when buying this product was that it wasn't clear which version I was getting. I relied on some of the discussion I saw that stated the VHS version contained the deleted scenes not available on DVD. There should be some mention by the seller what version he is selling otherwise the buyer may be purchasing something he or she does not want. Please be clear in your description to include which version you're selling! It was a waste of money!
1,Better hang onto your vhs with this one,"Unless and until a dvd or bd copy of this otherwise (at least) four star film is released , you should keep your vhs Director's cut . That Vhs Directors cut has about FORTY more minutes of content . About FORTY more minutes of character developement . Is a FAR superior version than this butchered , 108 minute travesty . These are two VERY different films . With the ""deleted scenes"" included as ""bonus"" material on this disc , that's just about what the distributor is doing to us . The 108 minute version should ONLY exist as a traier for the excellent ""much longer"" version of a terrific Sci-Fi film . Save your coin ."
3,"Yes on 1, No on 2","Lawnmower Man is a great movie with a great storyline and fantastic visuals. The acting is believeable with both Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey doing a slendid job. Lawnmower Man 2 should have been put in the lawnmower. When you hear about really bad sequels, this is what they were talking about. Just get Lawnmower Man as a single and you won't be disappointed."
4,Access Granted!!!,"This is a good scientific movie about a doctor named Angelo running some tests using virtual reality on a mentally challenged man name Jobe. After doing the tests and taking some drugs, Jobe becomes smarter and more dangerous. After doing more tests and more drugs, Jobe tries to take over Virtual Reality and become a Computer god, but Dr. Angelo tries to stop him, even if it means blowing up everything he's worked for. If you love sci-fi, you'll love THE LAWNMOWER MAN!!!"
1,The Lawnmower Man( edited 107 minute version ),if it had been the full unedited version i give it 4 stars.as for me i will only buy the unedited director's cut DVD.142 minute version.
4,Virtual Reality,Excellent movies to watch especially those who like films about virtual reality films.
2,"DVD release of ""Lawnmower Man"" butchers story line","With the release of ""Lawnmower Man"" on DVD, important scenes have been removed and retired as useless extras on the opposite side of the disk. These scenes play an integral part of the original story line, and in comparison to the VHS release, the DVD version is drastically butchered. Why bother; put them back in the movie where they belong to preseve the movie's original essence. You should not have to put a movie back together like a puzzle!"
1,Deleted scenes not what they seem,"The Lawnmower Man has always been one of my favorite movies since the first time i saw it in the theater. I saw it so often i got to the point where i memorized many of my favorite scenesOnly one porblem... when i watched the DVD, parts were missing.i flipped to the deleted scenes menu and wouldn't you know it, there they were, but you couldn't watch the whole REAL Movie with them in. The deleted scenes were nothing more than scenes deleted from the actual movie to give the illusion of adding something to the DVD version.not only shouldn't you buy this movie, you should write many many angry letters to the makers of the DVD"
1,Not What You Might Think!!!,"Lest anyone miss the point other writers weren't making clearly: This is NOT the movie you saw at the theater! New Line Platinum Series has taken the movie apart and reconstructed it as a chopped version on Side A, and if you want to see the twelve sections sliced out you have to flip the disc over!! They've vandalized this movie! Something's rotten here! Really! It's criminal! Damnit!"
2,Buy the Directors Cut VHS or wait for the DVD version.,"This is one one of my favorite computer movies of all time, under WarGames and Tron. When the movie first came out on video I ran out and bought it. Man was I upset. They had cut most of the scenes I had seen in the theater. So they came out with a Directors Cut VHS... Beautiful. Figuring DVD is the wave I expected the cut scenes to be in the movie. No... as an add on. How hard would it have been to just put them in the movie. Protest against this DVD and buy the Directors cut VHS.. and convert to cd your self."
2,Mindless Entertainment,"Certainly not Pierce Brosnan's best work. If you need some background while you do something else, it's okay. Don't be upset that I don't own this SciFi movie. I saw it when it was originally released at the theater. At that time I thought the graphics were great, but it just didn't grab my attention and hold it. I didn't mind going to the lobby for a soda, popcorn, hot dog, nachos, restroom, check out movie posters, make a phone call,... The problem is the story got to wrapped up in the lawnmower mans psyche. That would be okay if it was thought provoking, but it is mostly graphical halucinations and sexual innuendo. Not that illuminating into the characters motivations. One thing stands out in this movie. Some great early CGI. If you feel the need to see one of them catch this one, the second is much worse."
2,The LawnmowerMan,This is basically a great film. The problem with the DVD edition is the 12 deleted scenes. They where in the movie and they are in the VHS edition. So ...
3,ALTERED STATES MEETS TRON MEETS GARY MITCHELL,"Jeff Fahey plays an unconvincing idiot being experimented upon by Pierce Brosnan. The graphics as well as his suit comes from Tron. Fahey acquires superhuman powers from doing chemicals and playing video games (I tried to tell mom that was okay.) He then gets a god complex and thinks he is Gary Mitchell from Star Trek's ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" as the movie moves from an interesting science fiction film to a ""B"" movie. Sex, brief nudity, and the F-bomb. Rest in Peace James R. Kirk."
1,A lot of potential falling to waste,"Computer animation is just starting to cut in as the de facto special effect engine for cinema. Two excellent actors take a stab at an interesting concept -- computer aided learning. What went wrong? A horrid script. Some lazy writer turned this into a boring romp through goofy computer- generated vengeance. The physical effects (or physical components) are simply horrible. This is yet another technophobe flick, and it amazes me that so many computer-philes approve of this drivel. It is as bad or worse than those retarded god- complex star trek episodes. And I'm being nice."
1,"PAN & SCAN, WORTHLESS!!!","This release isn't worth your time. Both films (previously released in widescreen) are full screen here for some reason. I waited months for this release and put off buying the dirt cheap individual discs, which are now tough to find. Thanks for nothing, New Line!"
2,Was hoping for better versions.,"I picked this up in order to help complete my collection of cyberpunk films. In the back of my mind I was hoping for additional footage, cut scenes, etc.There is nothing extra here at all. A very poorly done full screen cut and piss poor menu's.Hopefully one day the DVD will come out in the US will all the additional footage and story additions. Sadly I'm not holding my breath."
3,Ok for the money,This product is ok. After using it for a few weeks I have decided it would have been a better idea to spend the money and get one with a moving front wheel. Also this stroller is a bit longer than I thought it was going to be. We took it camping and it was able to go on any terrain so it does serve its purpose. Overall I think it is a decent stroller but if you have the money a stroller that has the front wheel interchangable between fixed and swivel would be best.
3,Spend a lil' more and invest in a better stroller,"I wanted to see the reviews for this. Someone gave me this stroller brand new. I have a similar instep double. It is hard to turn this puppy, it does not seem very supportive or comfortable and it I am not crazy about the safety belt-just one buckle and since there is no front bar or tray it doesn't seem very secure. It is ok to unfold and fold. I like how it is pretty compact when folded. My daughter likes riding in it. Beggers can't be chosers. I am thankful for it nonetheless."
4,GREAT jogger except...,"This is a great jogger for it's price.....It's lightweight and folds easily and was easy to assemble. All three wheels come off quickly so it can be packed into smaller trunks or spaces. The seat is roomy enough for a good sized/older toddler and the hood gives adequate coverage. It moves along great while speedwalking/jogging but does pull to the left a bit...though not enough to be a huge bother. The only cons: the slight pull to the left, the cup holders are pretty much useless, and the harness system could be designed better. The straps aren't padded and the strap/loop that the belt straps go though at the crotch is very short. All in all, I'm happy with the jogger and would recommend it to a friend."
4,Flesh Field - Belief Control.,"The CD arrived in fair condition but regardless of some very minor wear I am glad to have this set in my possession.Strain for instance is a decent album however Belief Control's era of Flesh Field features a diverse mix of material some may be familiar being used to later releases others will find gems that stand out e.g. ""Caged"" & ""Conquer Me"". Weather you are an avid Flesh Field fan, or general electro-industrial listener I would regard this set a classic for Flesh Field's middle era."
2,This video was far too short and simplistic,"By the time I was settled into watching the video it was over. Too much time was spent in ""fluff"" and not enough in actual massage. Massage with Confidence is a far better video for the money, as well as Massage for Health and Esalen massage. Don't waste your money on this."
4,i like this sieries,"i have not read the mangas, but i have seen the show so mabey the manga is different but here is my review: while the characters are a bit stereotypic and its aimed at younger kids (with very pronounced lessons hehe)it is a nice siereis that i enjoy. the characters accutally have backround information and arn't phony superheroes."
1,Not The Teen Titans!,"If you read this comic book, you will notice that, oh My GOSH! This is sooo not the teen Titans! Raven looks like a gray and purple swim suit modle, and is as sarcastic. Starfire looks a whole lot diffrent, and she leaves a tail of orange, from her hair, as she flies. Cyborg never says , ""Boo-Yah!"" in these books and is a Major in the Serious army (there is no serious army, that is a figure of speech!, acts a little like Robin in the show, and only plays video games once, and that is when all the boys are playing. Beastboy, is a little more stupid than he should be, and keeps acting like ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"".Robin is very playful, and is not absessed with finding Slade. Not a very good comic! It was not based on the original Teen titans book, but if you read the original book, called ""The New Teen Titans"", you'll know this is the good Teen Titans! Still very bad, though..."
1,Ask Yourself Why Are These Units Reconditioned,"It is a real shame that this product is so poorly constructed on the inside. Ours worked great for 6 months and then the top element stopped working. Upon further inspection after taking the unit apart, it became readily apparent that all of these units will eventually fail; it's just a matter of time. The wire used is simply too small and the heat that builds up will quickly take its toll on the cheap components inside. The unit is actually pop-riveted together to keep the average homeowner from knowing what's under the hood. Unfortunately, it's so poorly constructed that it's not worth attempting to repair the burned up parts. It really is a shame because the unit on the outside is relatively well constructed.As another reviewer said, ""...there's a reason this unit doesn't have the UL seal of approval; the eventual electrical short can cause a fire...""I have some spare plates if anyone is interested..."
4,Woodhaven Firewood Rack...WOW!,"Was shipped the same day i ordered it. Arrived quickly and could tell as soon as i pulled it from the box that it was substantial. Other reviews said it was a two person job to assemble, but the wife was still sleeping so i attempted it myself, start to finish twenty minutes max, with little difficulty. The cover was also heavy and gives the appearance of durability. We live in a high wind area, so i will see how it holds up. I too read the other reviews and wanted something that would last. Its better to spend 199.00 once, than have to hassle with headaches, returns and being aggravated. I give it four stars only because i have only had this product up and loaded with wood for about twenty minutes, but couldnt be more hopeful that i wont have to buy another firewood rack for a long long time."
2,Doesn't hold a half cord of wood,"Read the dimensions of the rack 8' X 4' X 14"" that is 37 cubic feet. A Cord of wood is 128 cubic feet. This thing can actually hold about a 1/4 cord of firewood."
5,Highest of quality via USA,"If you're reading this review, then you are probably trying to weigh paying much more for this firewood rack than the others you will find on Amazon. Without a doubt, this is well worth the extra money. It is heavy duty, made in the USA and made with precision. Putting it together reminded me of the good old days when things were made well and when you lined up the holes for a bolt, you had to be exact with the alignment because it was fabricated correctly without the ""China Slop"" you find in other products. They even give you extra fastener parts in case you lose one! I must say that I am sick and tired of buying products that are cheaply produced. This is an awesome product proudly made in the USA and made right."
5,Buying Another One,"We bought our first Woodhaven a couple of years ago from a catalog. They no longer carry it. I came to Amazon to look for another. It is such a well built rack. The powdercoat is holding up great and hardware isn't rusting at all. We haven't had any problem with the cover coming off, but for extra security when it is fully loaded we have a couple of black bungee cords chris-crossed from post to post. We highly recommend this rack."
1,"Sedaris is Great, But Definitely NOT UNABRIDGED","Let me explain my rating. For Sedaris' work, 5 stars plus. My problem is with Amazon listing this as ""Unabridged"". It is not--it is significantly abridged. What is here is great, as you might expect, but some of my favorites are missing (such as ""We Get Along"" from Barrel Fever). Funny thing is, nowhere on the item itself does the word ""unabridged"" appear. Why then does Amazon list it as ""unabridged""? Not good--makes me wonder about their other descriptions. Buy it if you love Sedaris, but don't expect everything to be on these recordings."
5,A must buy,"Very very funny. A must read, or in my case, a must listen to on CD. David is the best storyteller out there. You'll be enjoying his stories for years to come."
3,Unabridged?,"I bought this for my cousin thinking it was a deal, I mean it says unabridged. But it is in fact abridged, they all are. So why do they say ""UNABRIDGED?"" I still like his work, very funny, but I don't like the false advertising."
3,"Could use more ""live"" tracks","David Sedaris is truly one of my favorite authors and I love to read his work. However, if you have never HEARD Mr. Sedaris' voice before, it takes some getting used to. At first it is almost painful to listen to because his voice is so... so... um... he sounds like Woody Allen doing a Woody Allen imitation.Nevertheless, his live tracks are hilarious - a little less ""in the microphone,"" if you will. If I could read and drive at the same time on my long business trips, that would be my preferred method of receiving David Sedaris' material."
1,Leave the reading to someone else,"David Sedaris is a talented and funny author but is a horrid reader. I have read Me Talk Pretty One Day, and have seen a Production of the Santaland Diaries, and was thrilled when I found this collection, thinking nobody could read a piece better than its own author. Was I mistaken! Sedaris reads like he is ready for a nap. Lines that had been funny in print were read as if the author didn't get the joke.Stic to the print copies, you will be much happier."
5,"Funny, Funny","Want to make a 18 hour road trip seem like 2? I've listened to these multiple times, and they are still funny."
3,Particularly interesting account of the area around Big Bend National Park,"the book is a hard read, because it is written in okie dialect. This can get old until you get used to it. But about 1/2 way through the book, the narrative is quite interesting, particularly to those who are familiar with the rugged Big Bend Country. Woody, his dad and friends explored the country around the Sam Nail ranch. You can still see the windmill from this old ranch, if you visit the park. It's wonderful wild country still."
3,Received 300 instead of advertised 360.,"First of all, it took Amazon 2 weeks for shipping and delivering.Second thing, the color came more yellowish than on the photo and lighter.Third thing is that label said 300 instead of advertised 360 thread count.Of course I would return it if I would pay $80, but for $30 and free shipping, I am OK with that. Just don't want to buy similar items from Amazon anymore."
2,Please change the title!,"Wrong size battery for APC BK200 being tall for the compartment. Partially exposed terminals (4 of them zig-zagged, instead of original 2 which should reside in a pocket - husband helped in trying to install and in evaluation) could short with compartment metal, a fire hazard. These are 2 generic batteries put together with double tape. There is no mention of dimensions (LxWxH) as it should like other suppliers. Didn't respond to first email, subsequently did. We RMA'd & returned ours and Amazon (A++) credited total amount, an unnecessary hassle nonetheless! Hope they change the title part which says '-------for APC BK200' and put the dimensions of the complete battery at 'Product Details' to avoid similiar experiences for buyers!!"
5,bath tablets,"These bath tabelts are awesome, very relaxing to the body and soul, I highly recommend this product to anyone who need to get a a good mood."
3,A Pretty Good Faith Fairchild Mystery,"It is always nice to travel to Aleford in Ms. Page's novels. Tom and Faith are not the ordinary Minister's family. In this novel, the church fundraiser turns deadly when a guest dies immediately after eating one of Faith's desserts at a murder mystery party of all things. The suspects are many, and once again, the success of Have Faith depends on the chef's ability to solve a murder. In addition to saving her business, Faith has to rescue the career of a beloved principal from an unprincipaled and overprotective parent. The mystery was very entertaining and there are many plot twists."
2,UNFAIR!!!,"I usually like this author and have read almost all of her books; however, after reading this book I definitely felt cheated. The book is well written, and the characters were pleasing, although I thought Faith was not being true to her character as presented in earlier books in the series. Agatha Christie used to say that a mystery writer must play fair with his or her readers. All of the evidence and the clues must be laid out for the reader to try to solve the mystery before the author resolves it. To do otherwise is to cheat the reader who has invested time in reading the book. No reader had a chance to solve this mystery unless by sheer guessing. Once the murderer is revealed, the reader realizes that it really could have been anyone, and all the clues have meant nothing. I was very disappointed, so I will think twice about getting any of her new books."
4,champagne at risk,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN AWSOME BOOK,GREAT MYSTERY BOOK! I PERSONALY LOVE JOAN LOWERY NIXON'S WORK! I RECOMEND THIS BOOK HIGHLY!"
1,"Defective, cheaply made product--Times two!","What a great idea though. Just lousy execution. Headphones fit like wearing your left shoe on your right foot. I could have lived with that, since I was just going to use them for 45 minutes at a time at the gym, but after I charged it and set it up, there was only sound from one earpiece! Called Nextar cust svc, they said it was defective. So I sent it back to J&R and asked for a replacement (because I really, really, hate how my MP3 wires get tangled in my gym bag). So the good folks at J&R send me a brand-new replacement and I'm very excited. Charge and set up, then find that on/off button is broken (i.e., no way to turn it on or listen to ANYTHING). Could be because the product is very (I mean VERY) cheaply made. Well, you get what you pay for. Returning to J&R for a refund. Too bad."
1,dont buy it,I returned this product because it had a constant buzzing on one side of the headphones but I would even return it if that werent the case. It doesnt fit around your ears at all- there is a gap between the headphone and the ear that feels very uncomfortable. The quality of sound is also poor. It is made of cheap material altogether. The controls are also hard to get used to. It looks brilliant when you think of it- mp3 player on headphones! But it doesnt work at all.
2,farewell to QMS,"The second QMS album after Dino Valenti muscled his way in, ""What About Me"" is an uptight hodgepodge of outtakes and scraps that is desperately trying to give the impression that the band is still together. In reality, John Cipollina and Nicky Hopkins were already on their way out, and David Freiberg, given almost nothing to do, would be gone in a matter of months. The title song, ""Subway,"" and ""Baby Baby"" are about as good as Valenti's songs get, but most of the rest is either forgettable (""Spindrifter,"" ""All in My Mind"") or junk (""Long Haired Lady,"" ""Good Old Rock and Roll""). An unfortunate step toward tarnishing Quicksilver's reputation."
5,if not the best QMS,pretty darn close to it. Great songs. Great LP for it's time. Well worth the listen and investment. Last LP with their best lineup.
5,the best shoes,"robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use. they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off! we've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off, but not these. its worth it to spend the extra $$ on these shoes. and they're so well made they'll last for baby #2."
3,The Late George Apley,"I bought this book because I love the 1947 movie version of the book. Itis quite different, and in my opinion, not nearly as good as the movie. But, since there was a popular play first, and then the movie (also verypopular) of the book, it is a good source to review."
5,Outstanding,"Great sleeping aid - hubby travels for work and has hard time sleeping in hotels but after popping one of those every night he sleeps like a log! I on the other hand suffer from seasonal allergies ... Or should I say suffered! .. Well, it didn't cure me but definitely gave me a great relief from most of my symptoms. Love it and recommend to everyone I know."
4,"A good product, that works",The vendor mailed this out right away and my daughter told me it worked very well. She told me she would order it again.
3,Black Seed Cold-Pressed Oil,Just started useing it a few weeks ago. Don't know about it yet. Need more time. Everyone said that it's very good.
4,Black Seed,Product arrived late. I do not know if it was due to the mail or what. When it did arrive it was in good condition and I have found the product to be of good quality.
3,"Meh, just okay...Might be overrated","I had high hopes for this because of all the great reviews. I had breast cancer, mastectomy, epstein barr (chronic fatigue), insomnia and colitis.It got rid of some eczema on my face for awhile, but it rears it's ugly head once in awhile. My insomnia is still there, my colitis is still there, chronic fatigue is still there. I take about 2-4 teaspoons per day (occasionally squirt a squirt in my mouth, throughout the day). It has been 3 weeks since I have started taking it. Maybe I need to increase my dosage? Maybe I need to give it more time? I've read a lot of studies about Black Seed Oil that shows it really should work on so many things, so I am still hopeful and am still waiting to see. If it starts working, I will come back and re-do my review."
2,Leaky gelcaps,"I can't recommend this brand. The gelcaps are poorly manufactured and they leak into the bottle. You end up with bunch of gooey, foul-tasting capsules (foul tasting because black seed oil tastes foul by itself)."
2,Defective manufacturing,"I can't recommend this brand. The gelcaps are poorly manufactured and they leak into the bottle. You end up with bunch of gooey, foul-tasting capsules (foul tasting because black seed oil tastes foul by itself)."
5,Egyptian Black Seed Oil,"In only 4 weeks, there have been amazing results on recent scar tissue from surgery...cannot say how it would do on old scar tissue."
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this thinking I was getting a set of four. Okay, now I read that it is only one vehicle, I misread, but I did not get any of the items pictured. I got an ambulance. This was not pictured at all. It is very small and I don't think for one vehicle it was worth the price. Viking makes cute, good quality toys. I wish I had realized this was a single item, I would have ordered a larger package. But I am very dissapointed that it was not one of the trucks as pictured."
3,Cheap but well made,"This toy is the difference between a good plastic toy and a shoddy plastic toy. For those of us nostalgic for quality toys (as oppose to toys made to barely last one child's use) you know the difference. The plastic doesn't bend easily, the wheels are rubber and roll really well.The toy isn't anything special, but makes a good gift when you need to buy something inexpensive for someone."
4,Entertaining and enjoyable,"All of six of the episodes are very good. The two I enjoyed the most was about learning about different cultures. The Christian who went to Dearborn, Michigan to live with Muslims and the Christian straight man who went to live with a gay man in San Francisco. I think about the saying ""Walk in another person's shoes before you make a judgment"". Meeting people you don't understand can make a big difference in how you perceive them. I found it powerful to see these men change their hearts and minds even if they still disagreed with some of their beliefs.I highly recommend watching this series."
4,kind of,had to watch this for school. these people pretend like they are pooor. they try to be poor for 30 days.
5,A must-see for everyone!,I show this in my Economics class and it makes a strong impression on the students! Great resource
4,new insign on the gay community,I really enjoy this one and had to buy it. It give a outside a insign to gay people and it make them human to rest of it. God made them for reason too and we should respect them for it.
4,Yurie's review,"I am a Japanese university student,and I watched the prison episode of ""30 Days"" in my English class.This episode shows Morgan Spurlock inside of an American prison for 30 days,and he lives just like all the other prisoners.Most of the prisoners at this prison were DRUG addicts. 16% of the prisoners had mental illness and they take medicines, but some people trade their medicine for some food.Morgan experienced a stay in a room alone for 72 hours.I thought the show was interesting because I could see inside a real prison.I would recomend this show becouse we could know what the people do in the prison and fear of drugs.And we could find the prisoner's pain."
4,Ryoko's Review,"I'm Asia University student in Japan. I watched this documentary of ""30days"" in my English class.Morgan Spurlock decide to go into American prison. There are many people cause a drug addict and a drug dealer. Some people are on drugs. They take reformation, counseling, and some plans. But their dependence on drugs is so hard and serious. They finished all program, at last, they were allowed to go out this prison. Still, most people back to this prison for the drug.I was surprised to see this show. Becouse, the drugs spread abroad in this society and many poeple get drugs from people close to their. Life in this prison, relationship, rule...everything different from our life. It's beyond all our idea.I would recommend this show, because this show reflects in time of American society. I think sense of ""bad"" and ""wrong"" should be better teach than know. This show is so vivid and real. Therefore it has worth to watch."
4,30days,"I am Asia university student and I watched the prison episode of ""30days"".Morgan Spurlock enter an American prison during 30 days.He knows the life of prison ,and I know too.I thought that inside of an American prison is hard,but there are joy too.The prison is interesting.I@would recommend this show."
3,30days,"I learned people in American prison,a life of them and a sistem of American prison.I would recomend watching the show becouse a prison is a world many people do not experience in their life.Watching this is a chance to know diffirent world."
3,Ryuhei's review,"I am a japanese university student and I watched the prison episode of ""30 days"" A normal American man goes to prison for 30 days. He lives with a prisoner. Most of prisoner are caused by a drug. I thought the show was disappointed. Because,The prisoner who finished the prison term back to prison. I thought that it was terror of drug. I would recommend this show ""30 days"" Because I can know the really prison. And I can use this DVD as a crime deterrent."
4,I like this documenntary,I'm Shoji Miyazaki. I'm a japanese university student from TOkyo.I watched of the documentary -30days- in my English class.I used to interested american caltur and black caltur.I like HIP-HOP. I like 2-pac and 50cent and black lob and utan clan.This episode shows Morgan spurlock inside of an American prison 30daysMorgan make a many friends in prison.We dont must drug.I would recomend this show friendry becouse I inspiration-friendly-.
4,Eye-Opening,"Before purchasing this DVD set, I had never seen the show. However, I liked Super Size Me so I figured this would be more of the same. I believe that this show is a great alternative to 'regular' reality TV, because you are absolutely guaranteed to learn something that you didn't know before. The episodes are great and let people approach a subject with an open mind to form their own opinion of what's going on."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,I FINALLY found some spatula's that will last a lifetime. Far superior to any other spatula you will ever try.
5,Awesome!!,"Bought these a gift for my wife and she loves them, I have used them too. Just as described, and the handles don't come off, which is what I was after!"
3,Progressive red color shades differ,"While these spatulas look durable, I expected to receive a set of three which were all the same color. I waited a long time to receive these, and now that they are here, I am not happy with them. The medium size spatula is more of a reddish purple, as in some sort of berry. Mulberry? It even has a different item # on the hang tag. It appears that this one was manufactured in China during a different time period. For some reason, that also gives me cause for concern. In addition to the different colors, these spatulas smell just like ashes, and that in itself would make me find these unacceptable."
2,spatulas,"Too stiff, way too stiff. I prefer a much more flexible spatula so that it will bend and reach the crevices in a jar, etc. Pretty to look at, although a very dark red, but minimally useful for me."
4,One-piece design is great,"After years of frustration with spatulas that detach from their handles when they are washed, these one-piece silicone tools are a welcome addition to my kitchen. Out of the 3 sizes, I find myself going for the middle size almost exclusively. The large spatula is just huge and a little heavy, and the smallest is pretty task-specific for jars and small bowls. They are sturdy, for the most part, but I think maybe just a little too floppy at the end. I also don't care for the textured surface. It doesn't seem to affect the performance of the spatulas, so maybe it's just that I'm used to a smooth surface and this is more a cosmetic preference. They also show water spots whether hand washed or placed in the dishwasher. All the cons are outweighed by the single pro of being one solid piece, though, and not having to worry about handles detaching or getting food residue/bacteria trapped. That makes it worthwhile if you are thinking of buying these."
5,Great spatulas but they are not red as shown in picture,"These are a high quality set that I am very pleased with. The description and photo on the Amazon website made me think they would be a nice bright red, but they are much more of a coral color."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"Thanks to existing review, I also needed a 4th item for the buy 4 & pay for 3 offer. Although the largest spatula of the 3 is mostly too big for most things, the other 2 are perfect. Strong with just enough flex and all 1 piece, not just silicone on a stick. I also like red color."
2,Sturdy but stinky!,"These arrived quickly, and it's all good on Amazon's end, but the product itself I cannot recommend. They reeked when I opened the box, much like an old doll's dirty hair when it's left in a hot car. The spatulas are dishwasher safe, so I washed them, hoping that the initial odor was a fluke. Nope. They still smelled awful, really nauseating. I wouldn't be able to use them on food, especially not to stir delicately flavored sauces and the like. The pros of this product would be that they seem to be sturdily made and flexible. The cons...the only REAL con...is that anything with that strong of an odor should never be used to stir cooking food. Or any food, frankly."
4,better than average new-school EBM/elektro,"This young 1-man project is very much in the same spirit as Assemblage 23 (ironically A23's mastermind Tom Shear helped produce it), only with more midrange vocals and the occasional vocal harmonies. It gets a little same-sounding around the middle of the CD, but gets a second wind on the last few tracks. Dark melodies, solid dance tracks, and a decent overall mix. Look out for this group."
2,What a coincidence!,"This probably the least enjoyable of the Nine Reilly series because there are so many coincidences. Nina & Paul are working on two totally separate cases in two totally different towns, and all of a sudden, the cases are magically tied together with the same people being involved in both situations. I could not suspend my disbelief that much! Also they never clear up how one of the characters (Kim) happened to be at the scene of a certain accident while she just happens to be having an affair with one of the other characters indirectly involved with that same accident. A disappointing book."
4,A great new heroine,"I am thrilled to discover Nina! I have been disapointed with my favorite characters from Patricia Cornwell and Sue Grafton lately. I'm excited to discover a new series to get to know. The ending of this book is a little forced and the parallel murders stretches credibility. However, the fun character development and location make up for the deficiencies. Looking forward to reading the earlier books which are supposedly even stronger."
3,"Good, Depending on What you Want","Entertaining, yes. Believable... well, uh, perhaps this is better left unsaid. There's just something beyond the pale in the predicament in this novel, which remains highly entertaining nonetheless. Its characters are likeable, the plot straightforward, and the issues interesting. This book is a good beach read or poolside froth, but for the readers committed to stories of simmering, complex motivations and labor-intensive research reeking of literary significance, this book is a bit too pop for you."
3,"Decent suspense, but laden with coincidences","The crisis of the story is Nina's hiding of evidence for the sake of a young man she believes in. Problem is, we don't get to know the young man, Jason, well enough to convince us that she would risk her career for his sake. He's supposed to be intelligent, but we never see him do anything intelligent. Basically, he's a blond blank.Then too, the ending is pure Hollywood chase/cliffhanger."
3,not the best in the series,"I've read most of the Nina Reilly series, and this one is my least favorite. It took a while for things to really get rolling, and there were a few too many coincidences for the plot to be believable."
2,Obstruction to success,"I was looking forward to reading this book and the other ones from the same author, but unfortunately, I found it difficult to stick to the book, and found it a shame to have all those useless sexual descriptions that had nothing to do with the case. I am a collector of murder cases and thriller books so it really is rare for me to criticize one of those books but this one didn't catch my attention enough. What misses is some kind of magical touch that some other authors have such as Higgins clark, kelman, rendell (this of course is only my opinion)."
3,Dissapointing,"I had read the first 2 books in this series. I liked them. Then came this one. Apparently no one proofreads these books. First: Nina picks up a cell phone and hears a dial tone???? Second: Nina spots Joe the gardener wearing a straw cowboy hat, minutes later Joe and Nina are talking and Joe is holding his baseball hat in his hand. Third: The trial begins and the name Jason Thomas De Beers is announced. Towards the end of the trial his name becomes Jason Quentin De Beers. OK it's trivial but it bothers me. Shows lack of respect for the reader. In addition to all that, the character ""Paul"" is a true pig. Sees women as his inferiors who would never dare resist his sexual demands. In one memorable passage, he wonders to himself why he did not rape ""Kim"" while he had the chance. I liked Nina and Collier and specially Sandy but not sure I will read the next entry in this series. OK maybe if there is absolutely nothing else for me to read...maybe...I may consider it. Not sure."
2,My first Perri O'Shaughnessy's book was a disappointment.,"A fan of legal thrillers,I was disappointed with the unbelievable plot and lack of any character development. It was quick reading, but more to get through it as quickly as possible. After reading the other reviews, I might read her previous books, being as this is said to be her weakest, but only if nothing else is available."
2,Won't become a favorite author,"Always leery about purchasing an unfamiliar author's books, I decided to take the plunge with ""Obstruction of Justice"". As one implausible coincidence occured after the other, I found the story becoming more and more unbelievable. Understanding that this is one of the author's weaker books, cared for it so little that I doubt I'll be looking up her earlier work anytime soon."
3,kind of flimsy but does the job,"in a standard heigh closet - the top rod is fixed beolw a shelf. when you hang this double rod - there reallly isnt enough space for clothes to go 2 high. it think it would wokr best if you will utilize the lower rod for short items (childrens clothes, petite womens tops, skirts, folded pants). It does not fit suit jackets, folded pants greater than 34"" inseam, means size XL tops, etc)"
4,Good for Kid's Clothes,"The rod was easy to assemble and hang. I use it in my children's closet for preschool and infant clothes. It works great! I wish there were some way to secure the hooks that it hangs from, because it swings a little back and forth, even with clothes on it. Other than that, I am pleased.This rod would not work for men's dress shirts. I tried my husband's button up shirts on the rod (he wears an XL and XXL) and they reached past the bottom rod. I tried them on the bottom rod and they drug the ground. Take into consideration that I am hanging this rod in a standard closet with built in closet rod that is about 60 inches off the ground. If the closet rod was hung higher, it may be possible to hang men's shirts from the bottom rod without the shirts dragging the ground.Four stars for doing the job I needed it to do--hang children's clothes."
4,great space saver,this was a great item I was able to hang all my shirts on it . It saves so much room looks so nice. I feel like I have my own department store in my room.
3,You get what you pay for,"This nightguard was about $300 dollars less than the one my dentist pitched to me, so the price is right. Although I couldn't tell the difference between this and a youth sized hockey guard. If you like, you could always purchase one of those for $1-2 instead..."
1,"Too Bulky, to big!",This mouthguard was too big and bulky for my mouth. There was no way I could sleep with this big thing! It was soo uncomfortable.
3,They replaced it for free!!! Great customer Service! Thanks Chuck!!,I chewed through mine in 68 days and it was supposed to last 6 months to a year and they replaced it with no hassle and no problems. Wonderful customer service.
5,Ultimate Kylie,If you like Kylie you will like the Ultimate collection of her videos. From the young fresh Kylie to the sexy showgirl that she has become... You get it all... All the biggest hits in one place... A MUST for the Kylie collector.
2,Hardly Ultimate - Especially in Sound/Picture Quality,"In addition to other criticisms of this set (an edited Can't Get You Outta My Head video and leaving a number of videos off), the audio is only in 2.0 stereo. This is a big disappointment as her concert videos were released with 5.1 Dolby and DTS tracks. Also, full-frame versions of Slow and Red Blooded Woman were included when widescreen masters exist (and were included on the ""Money Can't Buy"" DVD). Finally, all the widescreen videos are non-anamorphic and look horrible when (if you have a widescreen television) you have to zoom in on the videos."
5,"Leo may sound a bit strange singing, but you get used to it.",Mudlark is a hallmark to the true Kottke fan. He may sound funny singing but you get used to it. His unique style draws your attention and holds you with out needing your concentration. It is almost as pleasent as classical music and is great for studying to.
1,NOT Shonen Knife,"This is from a band called Nananine, as it says on the cover. As the previous reviewer stated, this is not a SK cd, though good in its own right. Be careful!"
3,Take it for what it's worth and have reasonable expectations.,"I bought one and used a file to sharpen the axe blade a bit. The first time I tried out the axe on a log, the blade literally bent nearly 90% out of line. I had to hammer it back into place on my workbench. However, if you take this tool for what it is -- a $20-ish- Made-in-China tool, then you won't be disappointed. This item is a ""survival"" tool, which means it's meant for survival. You're not going to chop or saw down a tree with it. It does come in handy for cutting small pieces of wood, digging small holes, hammering tent stakes, etc. Therefore, it's worth $22."
1,Don't waste your money,This product is junk. The shovel is the size of a large spoon and the ax has a flat head on it. Couldn't be sharpened if you had a grinder. Total set fits in the palm of your hand.Save your money and buy something usable.
2,Major Flaw,"I was not expecting much but received even less. I just wanted a tool for some motorcycle camping. But, a two cent saving on a part makes this less useful. The box cover show a metal pin with a recessed spring/ball that is used to hold the various heads to the handle. It came with a bolt held in place by a carter pin rather than the pictured arrangement. Yes, it works but the carter pin will break or be lost. I know some cold and raining night that I will be changing the head on the tool and drop the carter pin."
3,It's OK.,It's a good idea but in a miniature size. Decent quality. You can use the pick and shovel together if you do a little bending. Not big enough to get much done.
3,Mini,It was much smaller than I expected. About the size of my hand. Also the pin you pull out to change the heads was supposed to be a pin with a locking bearing on it but mine arrived with a cotter pin that you have to pull out and put back in everytime to change to different tools. That wont last long due to losing it or it breaking sooner or later. Solid enough though.
2,its okay,"so i bought this for my bug out bagPros:lightweightsmall and compactshovel is strongpick is good for clearing ice and as a tent stakeCons:the handle is a hollow steel tube very thinthe ax part need sharpinging and is covered with paint, a big no nohammer is useless bc there is zero weight behind itSaw is not sharp and covered with paintpaint has a plasticy feel to it and most likely going to be pain to be removethe pouch it comes with will most likely going to break not a very good material[...]"
3,ok product,"I will say its a good shovel, pick, and saw but the first time I tried to use the axe to.chop a small tree down it bent had.to straighten it out but other than the axe its a great product."
3,You get what you pay for,It's low cost and you get exactly what you pay for. I wouldn't want to depend on it. I'll have to test it a little more but I don't see this becoming a recommend carry all. For the weight I'm still looking.
3,Decent,Xmas present for my dad. For the price it was a nice stocking stuffer. He was entertained by it. Difficult to get back into storage bag. Took longer to ship than I thought was reasonable. I was glad I ordered it early.
1,Cheap Toy,"This shovel is FAR too small to be of use by anyone other than a child. The saw and pick parts are so cheaply made, they bend during use, The hatchet is more dull than the tip of my finger. A total waste of money... If you hike, camp etc... Do not bother with this one, you will be sorry"
4,Satisfied,"It's not amazing, but I'm satisfied for 20 bucks. I was surprised that the opposite side of the ax has a flat spot to bang on when splitting wood or to hammer in stakes. The pouch is worthless and the saw could be much better though. Everything comes dull so plan on sharpening the ax and pick yourself. You may also have to do a bit of bending to find tune the mounts. A bit small, but the shovel seems to be made to be sized for a pooper shovel so I think it is a good size. It is handy. I would not expect to use this as a main tool all the time, but it sets stakes, splits small fire wood, and shovels small holes when camping. If you find one without the pouch for even cheaper do that instead and just find something to carry it in."
1,Good concept but poor design,"I received this item and once opened I could do nothing but laugh. This is a mere kids toy with no practical use. Not one piece had an edge to it do be useful. I ran my finger down every surface without the slightest hint of a paper cut. I hope you are ready to break out a file and spend hours putting an edge to the saw and a few more on a honing stone for the axe, pick, and shovel. I guess a useful all in one design was too good to be true. I hope this helps anyone else even slightly thinking about this product."
1,avoid this product.,"this product arrived semi promptly. i have no complaints about the seller. however, the product leaves much to be desired. i would rather have burned my 20 dollars. this thing is horrific. it is cheaply and shoddily made, the instructions on the box are not comprehensive to say the least, and the product in the box does no match the instructions on the box. the shovel is small, the axe head is more dull than my property law professor, and axe was BENT and the ""pick axe"" is nothing but a piece of metal shaped to a rounded point. it is difficult to change the tool heads. this thing is awful. absolutely avoid at all costs. If you buy this, you are basically throwing your money away."
3,nice little multiple use tool in a compact size,"This item combines several different items, including a small axe and shovel. I bought it for the size, and I keep it in the car for emergencies. It doesn't look very durable, so if you need it for regular use or to chop down a tree or dig a foxhole, get something else."
1,what a piece of crap,"just got it and unboxed it. none of the parts fit correctly, and the metal pin is just there to make sure the parts dont go flying. the shovel flops around, the axe and saw tool are warped to where i cant even get the pin in, and the pick axe is in the same condition as the shovel. the axe isnt sharpened at all, the saw might as well go to a childs toy, and the pin doesnt have one of those metal snap balls, its got some kind of metal paper clip thing to keep it in place. buy one of these at a camping store so you know what youre looking at."
3,Just O.K,Bought the item as it seems to be something that will be handy. Item is smaller than I thought.Shipping was decent. Items fit nicley back into holder.
3,"Small, but great for packing or a bug-out bag",The prior reviews were right on. This is exactly what I was looking for. Wanted something that was multi-function that would fit in a bag. This tool fit the bill and at a great price. Seem solid and easy to switch from tool to tool. Only disappointing feature was the ax. Ax was not even close to sharp. Had to spend a few minutes with my Dremel and a sharpening stone. Now it cuts!
3,Decent product for $1 each,"I bought these in hopes of complementing a set of chopsticks I recently purchased. For a buck, they're really not bad. On one of them, there was a rough surface (probably where they'd been broken from the mold or something), but other than that, they were pretty good. Before buying, however, take a close look at the shipping rates. I paid $8 bucks to ship $4 worth of merchandise."
2,Cheaper elsewhere,"Not much to say about a coaxial cable except that I made the mistake of assuming everything is cheaper at amazon. This cable is a RG59, I found a RG6 (which is better) at Wal-Mart for under $9. This isn't a bad cable; it just isn't the best or cheapest. The only benefit I guess would be ordering it from home and avoiding going into Wal-Mart."
1,"RG59, not RG6","It would have been helpful if they would have mentioned somewhere that this cable is RG59, not RG6. Should still work, but it is an inferior cable standard."
3,Mother of Twins,"I really enjoy most of the Touch and Feel books. Unfortunately, this book isn't completely safe. There is one page that has a fluffy pink feather for the child to feel. My seven month old twins became very fascinated by this page because they could pull out pieces of the feather. I have to closely supervise them as I read this book to them. I would recommend the other Touch and Feel books. My children adore these books!"
2,Shopoholic Mom to Triplets,We have *almost* all of the 'Touch and Feel' books and this is our least favorite. The touch things aren't very good and this book seems unusually short. I'd definitely recommend another 'Touch and Feel' choice over this one.
3,Babys Growing Up,Babys come from mommys. You start off just laying. Then you start rolling.Come on baby let's go roll. Then we startcrolling.Let's go faster come on let's go. We are holding on to stuff while we are walking. Then we just let go so are parents can see us go.And that is how we grow.Bye Bye babys I'll talkto you again.
3,Flawed Remastering,"Beware of this remastered import release from BMG Japan. On track 2,""Say It Isn't So, the song begins in-progress; the first two notes are missing. I have this great album on vinyl, so I am well aware of how the song begins. Someone in Japan must have fallen asleep. BMG Japan should correct their error and issue replacements to everyone who purchased a copy. Very frustrating and very disrespectful to mistreat a great album like this."
5,Boswell Among the Best !,"Although I do not yet own the CD, I have owned the original LP for years and concur that when you put Connee Boswell in the company of the great sidemen in the Memphis Five, you have a winner! Connee, a longtime associate of Bing Crosby, in making some of the best sides ever and with her sisters doing a terrific job, makes her voice another instrument in these excellent takes. My late friend, Tony Sparbaro of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, is on drums and Billy Butterfield of the Bob Crosby Bobcats and several big bands is the lead horn man, with Frank Signorelli and others making up a tremendous driving unit. I totally recommend this CD and hope that it will be available soon at reasonable prices."
3,Philip Short segment,"This conversation sounded too much like apologetics for Mao. Short says Mao killed thirty million but others have placed the figure at much much more than that. Short makes the case for Mao as transformer of feudal China and creator of a modern unified state. But he does not detail the brutality of Mao. He does indicate that the Cultural Revolution was a disaster, and that Mao did not understand 'economics'. His take is that Mao with all his murders, must still be seen as one of the great Chinese leaders of all time, one of the four or five great Emperor figures.He speaks about Chinese ,who in spite of what Mao have done to their families, still admire him as great leader.For me there is not enough emphasis placed on Mao's monstrous cruelty. And on the lack of freedoms in China under Mao."
5,a nineties relationship with GOD the creater,"This is a very heart moving book. I felt that Lonna Traynor was right on all things of life, we must center ourselves back to GOD. This book will make anyone who reads it think of themselves are someone they know."
4,Here comes the social Commentary,"This book is a lot of fun. Totally different from Baker's Company books, it is a mix of fantasy and social commentary though really it's fairly light on magic sorcery, what we have is magic/mystical destiny. One the plus side it's funny as hell, showing a deft sure touch for dialog and situation that Baker is a master of, on the minus side it doesn't really flow like a novel. More like three long short stories, GOOD ones, but very distinct."
2,Not the quality of the Company series,The Anvil of the World is not a Company book. It is a fantasy book. It was not a very compelling book. It lacked the depth and layers that the Company books have. It was pretty pointless.
4,Fun to read,"This is my first Kage Baker book; I got it free for Kindle awhile back. I really enjoyed it but thought others should know that it really is three short stories, interconnected and with some of the same characters, rather than one long novel. Once I realized that, I enjoyed it much more. I laughed out loud several times while reading this book--it was not dark and gloomy, which for some reason I was expecting. The characters were unique and interesting and there were some lovely, unexpected surprises along the way. I look forward to reading more by this author."
5,Just funny and Eddie at his best!!!!,"Eddie is soooo funny as Buckwheat, James Brown as Annie, etc. I owned it on VHS when it was first released back in the day, this tape is just ""Old School"" funny. D1027 MI."
4,DEFLECTS WATER LIKE A MUTHA,MY ONLY ISSUE WAS THIS . I UPGRADED MY BATHROOM NEW TUB AND WALLS ETC. EVERYTHING IS FRESH BRITE WHITE EXCEPT FOR THESE DEFLECTORS ARE A BIT OFF WHITE SO THERE IS NOTICEABLE COLOR DIFFRENCE BUT MY SHOWER CURTAIN COVERS IT. SO ITS ONLY MY OCD THAT KICKS IN BECAUSE OF COLOR. KEEP IN MIND THE ADHESIVE ON THE BACK OF THESE WORKS REALLY WELL. HAVE A STEADY HAND WHEN INSTALLING BECAUSE ONCE THIS TOUCHES A SURFACE YOU WILL HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME READJUSTING THEM IF YOU PUT THEM ON SLIGHTLY CROOKED.ALL IN ALL WORKS WELL AND IF FOR EXTRA PROTECTION YOU CAN CULK THE SIDES TO MAKE IT TRULY WATER PROOF. DEFINATELY WILL BUY AGAIN IN FUTURE.
5,Works like a charm!,Quick and easy to install. The adhesive tape is very sticky so be sure to align properly.
3,Keeps the water out,"This product does keep the water in the shower. Installation is a one shot deal. Make sure it is very tight to the wall before stripping tape, and make sure shower is clean. Most likely, you'll need to apply Silicone caulking, so shop ahead for that."
5,Great shower utility,"I love this shower guard, it really helps my four children to keep water in the shower and off my floor! Prior to this purchase we kept having water going through the floor into the downstairs kitchen and through my kitchen light fixture! This product is an awesome value."
5,Works great,"I installed this splash guard so quickly. It is barely noticable and very sturdy. I used clear silicon caulk on the inside edges. Two come in a package but I only needed one so if this one accidentally breaks I have an instant replacement. It does work very well for shower splash, It is tall and protects from almost the top of the shower to the tub.Can't go wrong on its workability."
3,Yours Till Death,"Yours Till Death: Civil War Letters of John W. Cotton (Library of Alabama Classics)This book is a glimpse into the boredom and misery of the soldiers in that war, and probably like other wars. It is not easy to read due to the lack of grammar and punctuation in the text. It was published as the author wrote the letters home to his wife. After a few dozen pages the reader can begin to sort out the sentences and make some sense out of it, but some may get tired of trying before they get to that point. All that said, I still treasure the book due to the knowledge imparted of that tragic time when men tried to stop the invasion of their land by a government they could not abide. Buy it and take the time to read and understand...willie walker"
4,Vintage NGDB,"Great stuff if you're a big fan like me. Early '70s, interviews with band members, all live with some of the banter they're so good at."
5,Stars & Stripes Forever,"Yes! This is enjoyable and entertaining to the nth degree, I roared with laughing approval when I heard Glocoat Blues."
5,Classic Bluegrass!,"If you like Bluegrass, you will love this cd, I had it back in the LP days, and seen it in cd so I jumped on it. Buy it!!"
1,Less safe than label implies,"I bought this product at Target, but plan on returning it before I even use it. Why? I checked this out on the Environmental Working Group website, where they rate hundreds of sunscreens based on how safe their ingredients are. This product contains Octinoxate (and several other chemicals) that EWG raised the danger flag on.Octinoxate is a human endocrine disruptor-- it affected reproduction processes in animal tests, can disrupt cellular activities in humans, and can accumulate in human tissues, according to the site. The other ingredients have also generated concern in scientific studies. The site has detailed info about the ingredients and their side effects.EWG lists the best and safest sunscreens on its site. From now on, I'll check first before buying sunscreen... even those that say ""natural"" on the label!"
1,Natural!,"that's so cute some people call it natural... heee. i guess a product chock full o' chemicals and perfumes, skin irritants and allergens, can be natural. we could just poor some petrol over our head and call it a day."
3,alba sunscreen,"This sunscreen is a bit oily probably because it was left in the mailbox in sunny Florida. The emulsion must have separated due to heat, will not buy again via mail."
5,Best sunscreen on the market,I have tried many sunscreens while on vacation due to my pale skin and the lack of sun in Seattle. I am now a repeat purchaser before any vacation. The sunscreen rubs into my skin like a lotion which helps for sweating and water activities. The best part is that I do not smell like chemicals unlike other brands.
3,hmmmm.,"Of all the brother's stories that I've read from the Westmorelands, I like this one the least..the story was slow...i still have not finished reading it...I have moved on to Clint and Cole...even Durango, but this one I did not like...It was slow and hard to follow.sorry BJ"
3,"Good, but I've set higher standards for Brenda","Let me just say that I have every book that Brenda Jackson has out...even the ones that were out of print, from the Silhouette Desire series, to the Mass Market paperbacks to the Arabesque to hardcovers. This is the first book I have ever read from her that has me saying ""It's just okay"".Now, I'm NOT saying that the book is bad. It's good.I didn't feel the intimate connection between the characters that I usually feel.I am still looking forward to all of her upcoming books."
3,very good,"As a collector of all things Steele ans Westmoreland I absolutely could not get enough of this story. It was so worth it and I highly recommend anything this author writes. I promise you you cannot got wrong. I love how she pulls the reader into the story and keeps them there from start to finish. Bravo Ms. Jackson, bravo!"
4,Who Woulda Thought He Would Fall In Love...,"Brenda Jackson does it again with this book...Although it wasn't one of the best she has done, it is a good read! I love reading about the Westmoreland clan. I loved reading about Stone and how he falls in love with Madison. You should read (only if you have read the other books about the Westmoreland's)."
3,could have found a better way for them to meet,this one was so hard for me to read..and the daughter was one the dumbest mission to find her mother who had clearly told her more or less she was fine...and i have to agree with what someone else said about her books..why are they in such a rush to get married
5,Stone Cold Awesome,Madison and Stone were destined to be together and from day one you could feel the heat and passion between the two of them. Brenda Jackson truly has a gift for words and always seems to know the recipe for success when it comes to her books.
5,"Some of what i expected, and then some","Parts of the cd are full of the usual sample anticts from Cut Chemist that i expected. A The few songs that have mc's are solid lyricly, and the beats are more than that, they could be played as instrumentals and still be dope. The cd is a little short, but that doesnt make it anything less than great. The Garden is an epic song of strings and things with great production. A few of the songs are really catchy and will have you singing them all day (A peak in Time...He ho He ho, HEHO heho HEho, hehohehoheho. youl'l know if you lisen to it). All in all i'm very pleased with the album, and highly recomend it if you really enjoy underground hiphop, indie west coast production, soundscaping, turntablism, or pretty much anything. plain ol dope"
4,four songs you'll love...,"and the others are good, too. I'm particularly fond of ""Spat"", which rolls nicely into ""What's the altitude"". Spoon has a great groove, too. ""The Garden"" seems to be the song that gets radio air-time around here, so you'll recognize and dig the track."
3,Cut Chemist,"I anxiously listened to ""The Audiences' Listening"" this morning on the headphones - hoping to devote myself to the full experience. And after about 45 minutes, I was left thinking ""Is that it? Really? That's all?"" D'oh!Now by no means am I saying that this is a bad album; it's just definitely not 5-star material. This did not blow my mind, or blow my headphones. In fact, it's hard to say there's a lot of standout memorable cuts on here.The beats are good, but so are a lot of other people's records nowadays. The cutting & scratching though is cool, since that's rarely heard anymore.I guess I was hoping for the second-coming of DJ Shadow's Endtroducing. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe this album is just ""good"" - 3 stars, nothing more nothing less. I'll definitely pick up his future stuff, Jurassic 5's, and Ozomatli's in the future though."
3,Interesting,"Interesting short story. Very true to PK Dick style, which is a bit bizarre. It is short, so there's nothing to loose."
2,Bad Ending,"The premise for this short-story was good, but the end was lack-luster and ultimately disappointing, at least it was short so too much time was not wasted."
3,Good concept - Bad Conclusion,"It's a good story, but the ending is weak. I get the metaphorical context, but I just didn't find it satisfying."
4,black god of the metro,good book just what i needed to review some things that i had been thinking about for years
3,Scrambled Eggs and Whiskey,"I liked less than half of the poems, but the poems that I liked were very good. I am glad that I have the book. I will try another book by him."
2,Football Girl,"This book is about a player that you thought would never play. Her name is Jill Winston. She plays, not soccer, but football. Jill plays for the Panthers. When the coach saw her play basketball, saw how high she could jump and much better she was then some of the players, he said she was the miracle they needed. He put Jill on the team and said when the QB throws the ball to Jill and she catchs it, she gets out of bounds without getting tackle to be hurt. The problem they had to get over was Jill going out with one of the players and how he would act. They got over that Jill's boy friend was mad at first, but he got over it in the long run. She was a top wide receiver and lead the Panthers to win the Championship. At the end Jill returned to basketball her favorite sport."

4,Very Good photos,Much better than the first book. The first while good was to technical. We all love Ray Harryhausen for his visual work and this book shows it off beautifully. I highly reccommend it.Phil
2,"No here, not there","Unfortunately this dvd is not upto the quality of other salsacrazy products. Neither is good to learn salsa nor as a workout routine.The salsa steps are covered too briefly and only from the man point of view (so ladies can't learn their steps), but at the other side the steps you need to learn are too complex for a workout.If you want to learn salsa get The complete salsa mastery from SalsaCrazy. For effective workout, get something else."
1,it's a basic step lesson video,"It's a basic step lesson video, there is not much 'workout' to it at all. The instructor teaches all moves with the leader's footwork. ""Whoo, almost lost my balance"", he says at one point. It seems like the same basic step over and over with slight variations, like a tap. It's not 'fun and energetic' - it's repetitive and boring. He does the same routine 3 times with different music. For the price, get something else."
1,Salsa Workout,"This was not what I expected. This was not so much a fitness dvd as it was a dance lesson dvd. And it was not encouraging to show what I learned on how to Salsa and then get told that is not the right way to Salsa.Very disappointing, I wanted a Salsa workout dvd, was willing to settle for this even though it was not that good of a ""workout"", because I was going to learn to Salsa, and then to discover it was not teaching me to Salsa properly.Returned item for full or partial refund.Do not recommend."
1,not a workout at all,if you want to learn basic salsa steps this is great. if you want something exciting and fun to do this is not your video at all. it is boring and lacks excitement. i do not feel that i had any sort of workout afterwards.
2,Awful shipping idiocy: Signature required on delivery for $8 cable,"This pertains to shipping. On Amazon, you can't separate the product from the shipper sometimes. Whomever is shipping this does not understand the concept of convenience, or why people buy common items online.I bought this online to cost myself one less errand, to avoid a 2 mile, 20 minute trip to Lowes or Radio Shack, because I had a lot to do and wanted to get this purchase my plate. The seller attempted to give me that errand back by requiring a SIGNATURE for a UPS delivery on an measly $8 cable. So now, having missed two delivery attempts, I must now drive FIVE miles to the UPS hub to pick this package up. So the seller can protect themselves from an $8 loss.The point of purchasing common items online is convenience. Don't inconvenience your customers with petty signature requirements.UPDATE: THE SELLER WAS AT LEAST NICE ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A REFUND, SO I WILL UPGRADE THIS TO TWO STARS."
3,"High loss cable, do not use for high def","I bought this cable after rearranging my living room. Works fine for standard definition TV but do not use to connect to a high-def cable/satellite box. High-def channels came in pixelated and jerky due to high signal loss in cable. After a cable tech finally came out he determined that this cable was the issue (replaced with higher grade, no further issues)."
3,mistaken order,"Presumably, in reading through the varios types of cable offered via Amazon, I clicked on and ordered the wrong one. I received a regular coaxial cable. I wanted an ulta thin cable for my hd tv so I could run it around door frames, etc. with as little as possible cable visible. After 3 attemps at trying to get some information from the seller as to who had made the mistake, I was finally told that it was my mistake, it would cost me about half of the original price to return it, and that they did not carry the cable that I wanted. It does the job, but it is not what I wanted and was extremely unhappy with the service I received."
1,NOT READY TO USE,"This product did not come ready to use. I had to buy the Poe injector which supplies power for $35.00 separetly, and then realized it did not come with the instalation software. I contacted the seller and it took them over 1 week to reply. I still cannot install it.IT WAS NOT SPECIFIED IN THE PRODUCT DETAILS that I would need to buy the power supply Poe separetly, and that the instalation program did not come with the product."
3,Trees - On the shore,A rare piece of music ! Not that many bands made music like Trees.It's a mix of folk and soft pop.
2,Repetition is a poor substitute for scholarship,"I chose to read ""Empire,"" after seeing several highly complementary reviews. It was entirely too repetitive. The basic theme is that the eastern european jews who came to the new world and eventually founded the great Hollywood studios carried several traits in common and a desire to beat the gentiles at their own game while relinquishing ties to their judaic pasts.Swell. But how many times do I need to read it? And how profound is it to inform readers that too great a focus on material success and skirt chasing often has deliterious effects on one's home life and spiritual life? And that capitalism can be cruel? If you want to read about the world that these truly impressive studio moguls founded, I would suggest ""City of Nets"" by Otto Friedrich."
4,"Highly informative, save for occasional factual errors.","I merely wish to correct a factual error contained in Neal Gabler's otherwise highly readable book. And the error appears in the TV documentary as well. My brother Lee J. Cobb's original surname is NOT ""Jacoby"" but Jacob. The play on the surname ""J. Cobb"" was actually conceived by our father, Benjamin Jacob. I cannot imagine how this bit of misinformation took root. And it seems somehow to be spreading. Of course, I will enlighten the author as well."
3,Patience!,"Waiting til my husband's birthday and he reads it. Then I'll read it. Soyou'll have to wait for a critique. As far as speed and quality of item, verysatisfied with the book. THANKS!"
1,plays like a hollywood script,"I had to see the movie for some odd reason. I agree with the last review on many points. The film makes it sound like the Jewish people were the sole inventors of film. It is horribly cliched, and makes etremely odd, partial points, like that ""My Fair Lady"" is an example of the jews trying to fit in. It plays out like a script written by the moguls themselves. Waste of time."
4,Excellent insight into the construction of American myth,"Insightful analysis of how the wide-open land of opportunity was not an ever-present American ideal but was in fact invented by those who most wanted it to be: poor, persecuted immigrants. Unlike the racist and elitist establishment cinema of the East Coast, Jewish Hollywood promoted recurring themes of equality of opportunity -- haunted by nightmares of persecution. The movie 'Hollywoodism' may be in some ways better than this book, because you can see the evidence for yourself. Nonetheless, recommended."
4,The men who made Hollywood,An indispensable social history of Hollywood and the movie industry. The history is compelling reading for those who want to know the inner workings of the movie business. All the myriad of details are expertly woven together into a compelling story and enhanced with interesting photos
4,Great depth,"Great read! I would recommend this book to everyone. You will not be disappointed, and you will not want to put it down."
4,Very detailed,This book seems to follow every curve and bump in the Hollywood history road. Very interesting and revealing but sometimes you get the feeling you are just plodding along in too much detail.
2,opinionated,"I find that the book has many examples of poetry from many different styles and viewpoints. However, the text itself as a learning tool is not up to par. The author allows his own personal opinions to show in his writings and many of the concepts discussed could be better explained."
3,Huyen,I think this book is ok for learning wise. Its boring if you are looking for poems to read. There are a lot of missed spelling in the poems. Some are not even the same lines as the original. I read through many of the poems in the book and look through a lot online and they don't even match. I'd never by this book if I didn't need it for school.
5,A splendid source book,"This is a wonderful resource for anyone in love with poetry. Packed with great learning about the various closed and open forms, the use of poetic devices, and rich examples drawn from the greatest poetry ever constructed. There is a great deal about the poetic imagination and how some of the acknowledged geniuses have generated their best work. It is a book you will revisit time and time again."
3,Not what I thought I was getting,"Shipping was prompt and the product was in good condition, but I had searched for a FIFTH edition of Western Wind, and this came up, listed as a fifth edition. When it came, it was a FOURTH edition, pretty much useless to me. Totally false product description."
3,Three and a half stars,"First of all, I want to explain- Just because I gave this book 3 1/2 stars does not mean it's a bad book. I just do not casually throw around 4 or 5 star reviews like most other people do. 5 stars for this book??? Really??? So... it's on the same level as, for example, Pride and Prejudice? Yeah, OK. Anyway, on with my review. I thought Enna Burning was better than Goose Girl. It was more exciting. I am looking forward to reading the third installment in this series. I give it a solid 3 1/2 stars- it's not fabulous but definitely a good story. The second half was especially engrossing. The ending felt rushed."
3,Slightly Dissapointed,"I really enjoyed reading Goose Girl; the ideas seemed fresh and the story felt original. I dug right into books two and three but unfortunately the magic was gone. Enna burning dragged on and seemed a little too predictable. There was a little too much of the obviously incorrect ""I think everyone hates me"" emotional conflict. It almost felt like I was reading twilight.There were some highlights like the final chapters and the first chapters. I think the storyline is solid enough, but it just didn't seem as polished or suspenseful as book one."
3,Cute,"My first impression upon finishing the book was ""it's cute"". Then, I reminded myself that the book's intended audience is twelve and that made me feel better. Enna Burning is equally as clean as Goose Girl, it's predecessor, and is a creative and inventive story of Isi's friend Enna who learns how to speak to fire. The land of Bayern is now at war and Enna believes that her new skills can help save her homeland. Enna has a mighty adventure as she learns how to control the fire and not let it control her. The writing is simple but that is appropriate for the audience and I believe that my daughter will enjoy this series in a few years."
5,Book of Bayern series,My granddaughter loves this series and has readthem all thanks to Amazon and the wish listsystem...This is a adventure series for youngteenagers.
3,A little creepy and unpleasant,"My 13-year old daughter and I are both reading this series and were both a little disappointed by this book. There's something creepy about it. It has a darker feeling than Goose Girl and was, at times, downright unpleasant to read. The idea of so much fire and burning people alive was disturbing. The main character is often impulsive and makes bad choices. I thought the beginning was a little slow, the middle was very disturbing with so much fire and death, and the ending felt overly contrived, with everything suddenly wrapped up nicely with a bow. But I've really enjoyed Shannon Hale's other books and will certainly continue reading this series. I think she does a great job of providing exciting novels for tweens who aren't quite ready for adult novels -- and yet they're well written enough to hold my interest as well. I just found this particular book more unpleasant than fun. And my daughter agrees."
5,Favorite,"I trust Shannon Hale as a writer completely. Although I am resigned that the rest of the series after the Goose Girl will not have the same sweet, serene, fairytalesque voice, Enna Burning comes very close and is a delight in its own right.The plot is haunting, intense, and intriguing and I have respect for the main character as well as a growing love for the side characters in their loyalty.A wonderful sequel told in a down to earth voice."
5,Amazing,"I was hesitant to read it because of the change in the primary character, but I am sooo glad I did! I liked this one even better than Goose Girl! It is even more action packed, with also more tender moments, and all of your favorite characters from the previous book still play major roles. So good!"
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,"I love this book! Is it wrong to love a sequel more than the first in a series? cause I do. I love all of Shannon Hales' work (yes, I have read them all and wait rather impatienly for more) and this is my most favorite. In fact it is one of my most favorite books of all time, right up there on the shelf by Harry Potter. Read it! but definitely read the Goose Girl first, you'll find you can't stop and you'll read them all too."
4,Not as good as The Goose Girl,"I'm not sure why, but I've never liked this book as well as The Goose Girl. I'm not as fond of Enna, especially since she seems to fall for the bad guy so easily. I like the very end of the novel the best... perhaps because I like Isi so much better, and she had a much larger role there. I didn't like the war between the two countries in part because so much of it was from the point of view of Enna while she was under the influence of the fire language. I didn't like that it had so much sway over her. Fire doesn't just burn, and destroy, it can also warm, and provide light. The only aspects of fire Enna ever seems to receive are the negative ones.Overall, apart from those negative things, it was a good story. I feel it's just very much a middle book, and has middle book syndrome."
5,Shannon Hale is an amazing author,I recommend reading all of Shannon Hale's books beginning with Goose Girl. They are great for young adults readers as well as adults.
4,Basic cheap coax cable.,"If you need a basic cheap coax cable, then here you go. It is cheap, it feels cheap, looks cheap, and is cheap. It is super thin and light weight. The insulation feels cheesy. It works, that is all!"
5,Sammy Hagar's First True Rock Album Is White-Hot,"Sammy Hagar's second solo album is his first true rock album on his own, and it's white-hot. Heavily influenced by Ted Nugent and the Outlaws, this CD rocks hard and never quits until it ends. The best song here is ""Rock & Roll Weekend"", but there are plenty of other goodies here as well. Hagar's advocacies of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, increased funding for law enforcement/community policing, and capital punishment or life without parole for kidnappers make SAMMY HAGAR an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,I think that it is one of the best,i have plenty albums of his and i think its the best.and i expect to listen to him and see his concerrts evey time hes in town.:):):):)
5,one of hagars best,just saw sammy in concert in pa. he is at his best don't miss seeing him if you get the chance he played red it was great!! T.P.F
2,"New Packaging ""Not for use in flashlights""","I recently bought these batteries because i needed new batteries for a flashlight. When the product arrived their was a small white sticker that said, ""Not for use in flashlights"". The description that Amazon has does not say that. Considering it would cost more to ship back than i paid for them i decided to try it. I only have turned my flashlight on for a few seconds at a time, but so far it is still bright. I don't know why they the new packaging said ""not for use in flashlights""."
1,Ultralast lithium battery,Used one battery in a night owl optics vision. Lasted only one month. Have put the second one in so we'll see if it lasts any longer!
2,Not suitable for long term storage,"I bought a 50-pack of these from another vendor back in 2007 for the amazing price of $34.50. Twice in the product description they were advertised as having a 10 year shelf or storage life. It was said that they had a ""low self-discharge rate (0.5% per year at room temperature)."" Last week I put one into a new flashlight and noticed the light seemed dim. I found that running one in a flashlight for just a few seconds would drop the voltage by 0.2-0.3 volts. Out of the 26 batteries that were left, only 5 had enough current to keep the flashlight reasonably bright, and only one would run it at full brightness. So tonight I tossed out 21 out of 50 batteries. I might as well have thrown $16.56 into a shredder. They aren't advertised with a 10 year shelf life any more, for good reason, so don't buy more than you can use in a couple of years or so."
5,excellent value!,"something like %400 cheaper than a store, including shipping. they fit right in to my 5mW laser and so far working perfectly."
2,Disappointed to say the least,"I guess I was expecting to get some lifespan on the battery, even if they were only $2.50 when I purchased them... I popped them into my camera, took photos of the sunrise which took all of about 30 mins and looked at the battery life and it was already depleted 50%! Needless to say I have about one more shoot of battery life so I'm using it sparingingly. All I have to say is you get what you pay for!"
1,Not happy with retailer,"The batteries were opened when they arrived, not worth the hassle to return. Poor impression that this looked like a returned item when I received them."
1,Do not buy it.,"Bought it for another product in the same batch from Amazon.Thought the other one is DOA, made an exchange, same thing happened, started to suspect the battery could be the problem, change to the other one, it works. Use multimeter to check:one measure 3V, the other 1V. It should be called UltraCrap. Do not buy it."
1,not workable!!!,The batteries were very weak to the point of un-usable !!!But the trouble of returnining them was not worth the time as to the cost of the batteries !!!Would not recommend this product to anyone !!!
5,batteries,GOOD PRICE Fast delivery. havent used yet but expect to be very satisfied these are used to power a special tactical light that I use at work
2,Lithium battery,"The description said Size 123. I have a '2', but this is too large. Amazon said batteries can't be returned."
1,These didn't work at all,I put them in my smoke detector about a month and a holf after I received them. They didn't work at all.
1,Worthless,"These lasted two charges. I mailed them back for a replacement, which took months, and those failed as well. Wait for a more reputable company to make this type of rechargable. Otherwise, you can find them for as little a $1 each on ebay."
2,"Same price, worse performance","I bought the Ultralast 2-pack as a filler item. Out of the box, one cell measured 100% on myZTS testerand the other one measured 80%. Not acceptable, AND hazardous to use in 2-cell lights (the weaker battery can burst and start a fire).It is not hard to find Energizer, Duracell, Panasonic, or Rayovac CR123A batteries online for about $2.00 each. Or even off-brand Titanium or Battery Station for $1.00 each. But every cell from these manufacturers shows 100%, in my experience."
1,just plain lousy batteries...,"I bought several packages of these to use in a smoke detector. I was tired of running out to the store for a new Duracell every few months, and at half the price, I figured, if they don't last quite as long, what's the harm?As opposed to the Duracell, which lasted six months in my smoke detector, I have had to change these batteries once every 3-4 WEEKS. Judging from the number of positive reviews, perhaps other devices are better matched to these batteries, or possibly there's just really poor quality control. Either way, I wouldn't recommend these to anyone for any critical application."
1,Out of Date Batteries from Amazon,The reason these batteries were so reasonable is that they expired several months before they were delivered. And there is no way to contact Amazon other than to return them which would cost as much or more than the cost of the batteries. There should be some other way to get Amazon to replace them without having to send them back!
1,"DON'T RENT THIS, IT IS NOT THE WHOLE SEASON!","Beware! I rented this and it is not the whole season. It is only episode 1 and 2! I did enjoy it, but am giving it 1 star to keep people away until Amazon fixes this mistake."
5,Palanhunks Louater,I think this single is great I love it Can us tell me somat why is everyone having a go at Chaz a mean it was a good deseison
4,Not long enough,"I very much enjoyed this book and I learned quite a bit. Unfortunately, it didn't discuss a couple things I was hoping it would, and in my opinion, it wasn't long enough. All in all, I'm satisfied that it reveals the true history of blacks in this country, and Barton is as fair as possible to democrats, considering all that they did. Its a good read and skims the surface of the black heroes in this country."
5,why is this history not taught?,"I literally cried when I read this book!!! I am a 57 year old white woman that never knew there were so many black founders. Yes I said founders. I did not know how crucial they were for the independence of this country. Did you know that? Also did you know in the 1700's blacks could vote, they sat on the Supreme court and had a seat in congress? Did you know Democrats took their voting rights away and President Woodrow Wilson, Democrat segrated restrooms, diners, fountains etc? He also enacted pro-segregation policies within his administration, and so very much more? This book is based entirely on recorded history complete with 472 footnotes so you can research for yourself. I have no political agenda with this review and firmly believe you really will have your eyes opened and have a deeper appreciation and love for your country and how the government destroyed the black family in the late 1800's and early 1900's."
5,The REAL History,David Barton does a fantastic job of clarifying history. If I were African American I would be quite angry that this information is not out there and taught to EVERYONE from an early age. What a wonderful history of a people that has all but been ignored. It shows that blacks have had to struggle for everything they have gotten and who the REAL racists are. What a sad commentary on the Democrats and what they have done to try to keep these people down just because of the color of their skin. Shame on them!I bought 3 of these books so I could share with others because I want people to KNOW THE TRUTH!
5,Spread the Word,"I read the reviews of some of the readers and I would like to add my piece as well. I like history, especially American History and was amazed at the content of this book - half of which I did not know. I have been buying the book and giving it to people. I suggest that all the readers do the same. Buy them and place them in college common rooms, schools, libraries. Just leave it lying around."
5,In Black and White,It was a well documented history of blacks in America following the Civil War. I am concerned there may have been a political agenda. I have not attempted to verify the details but believe them to be accurate. I wrote a book review and have loaned out my copy to interested friends.
5,Excellent,I'm a white man but I'm mad as hell that this black history was hidden from me when I was growing up and going to school. I can only imagine what a black person must feel when being denied the truth about there rich black heritage. Woodrow Willison should be dug up out of his grave and hung by his neck.
5,American history in Black and White,Absolutely stunning to read. I am amazed at how little of our real history is ever taught. In a time where our politicians seek to divide us as a nation this is a book of unity that many of us never really knew. This history is one many blacks should be boastfully proud of and the contribution of their people that altered our nation's history. Significant history that altered the course of our nation's birth. This makes me even more proud of our nation and her people. A must read for all who sincerely desire to learn both the good and bad of our nation's history.
5,Truth may surprise you.,"This is important, especially for blacks, but for all who love freedom. Don't let the media and politicians con you."
2,Not what I thought,This reads like a propaganda piece with some truths mixed in. I was hoping for a history of black leaders and heroes of our great country. I know there were numerous black founding fathers and heroes and this book does touch on them and contributions of blacks through the years but this is more about how they were stamped out of history and who is to blame. Not interested in a blame game book. Gives us the facts please.
3,"Good research, poor writing","This book is highly researched, meaning references for everything mentioned. The information will certainly be useful to anyone who wishes to know the facts about how the black man [and woman] has helped make America the wonderful country it has become. What will make readers upset is the fact that former slaves brought to this country were, when given the opportunity, almost universally Republican wherever they had the chance to vote until the days of unionization and the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. The racism practiced by such supposedly enlightened Democrats as Woodrow Wilson is remarkable.The major flaw of ""Setting the Record Straight"" is the total lack of proper editing; the writing itself is so poor it becomes a distraction. Also, it is quite clear that the author could not keep his disdain for the liberal left within check. I doubt that such a person would get very far into the book, despite the fact that the truth is being told."
1,Sexist advice to keep girls financially uninformed,"As graduation presents my brothers get books like ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias and ""One Up On Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch. They're logical, solidly researched and well written. I got this book as a graduation present and am apalled that a woman would actually write such lightweight fluff and try to pass it off as good financial advice. The only substantive thing in this book is the overabundance of exclamation points! I believe that women can make great strides financially but not with inconsequential books like this one!"
1,Old Author Gives Out-Of-Date Advice,"Like having your great grandmother try to tell you about financial markets based on the crash of 1929. This author who is much, much older than she is pretending, glosses over the important financial information that we do need to know. So what do we get instead? A horrendously written book, with no substance but with an overabundance of exclamation points !"
1,"If your IQ is under 75, maybe","If you have enough money to begin investing, you're going to find this book insulting, demeaning and condascending. Sounds like it was written by someone merely trying to cash in on the insecurity of girls when it comes to money. Shame on the author!"
1,Disorganized! Lacks substance! Poorly written!,But it's loaded with exclamation points! ... The author shouldn'thave tried to write a vast book with a half vast idea. Then sheshould not have tried to make up for the lack of good writing byoverdosing the reader with exclamation points! There are good bookson this subject but this sadly isn't one of them!
1,Much Too Superficial -- Money Is Not Like a Bad Hair Day,"Tried it. Didn't like it's overly cute tone. The author says that managing money is like coping with a bad hair day. That was my first indication that this author didn't have a clue. I've been trying to pay off my college credit card debt for over two years now and not making much progress (and this book did not help).Getting back to the author's hair analogy: With a bad hair day you can at least wake up the next day with an entirely new, and more attractive, hairdo. Unfortunately, if you're having a bad money day, I know from experience that you're probably also having a bad money month and probably a bad year or more. You can't just go to bed and wake up with your money problems solved. I wish it did work that way but it doesn't. It's too bad that the author doesn't know at least that basic fact about money."
1,This book is milking your fears and wasting your money,"Whether you know a lot about mutual funds or next to nothing, you need up-to-date information in order to make smart money moves. This book totally misses the mark (I foolishly bought it for my daughter), so don't waste your money.You'd be much better off either going to FREE WEB SITES, such as Morningstar.com or Money.com (from Money Magazine) or Smartmoney.com (from Smart Money Magazine) that provide current and EXTREMELY well reseached information on mutual funds and all aspects of money matters.If you do want a good investment book, consider Peter Lynch's One Up On Wall Street or Andrew Tobias's The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need."
1,Childish,"I don't know much about money so I need information. I'm not stupid, however, so I don't appreciate being talked down to by this book. And what's with all the exclamation points! They just fill up pages and show how little is really in this book!"
4,A Charming Little Book,"How Reindeer Fly is a sweet book, my daughter recently met the Author at her school. The illustrations are brightly colored and would appeal to young readers.We also liked the ""Magical Stardust Crystals"" included with the book. It would make a cute Christmas gift for children starting to read."
1,A Dangerous Suggestion,"Look kids, taking crystal makes you fly! I decided not to give this book to my niece after I actually read it. Poorly constructed poems aren't necessarily bad for children, their own poetry would be similarly basic with forced rhymes. What concerned me is the author's premise. If we need to keep Joe Camel away from children, we need to keep reindeer crystals away too. Adults I showed it to, quickly interpreted the story as how Santa Claus keeps his reindeer high on crystal meth that his elves produce in a lab. A cute gag gift for adults. A definite ""no"" for Children. One star for cute illustrations."
3,no gracias,"Kun's ""Audiotopia"" is incredibly dense and mostly mundane. Its ideas are buried in academic blather and pseudo-technical vocabulary like ""audioracial"" and ""univocality."" Suitable for graduate students in dire need of quotations for middle-of-the-road American Studies papers.The closing line of ""Audiotopia"" sums up the chaos of the book's thesis:""There were no 'open mouths,' no 'strong melodious songs,' no symphonies and no orchestras, just a house full of strangers huddled beneath a sky still ringing with sound.""Indeed, this book is a house full of strange, obvious ideas."
3,review,"The nail polish was worth the cheap price, and worked well for a night out, but didnt last more than two days. I used it with a top coat and it looked great the first day, but started flaking off on the second."
4,Nailpolish,I bought this nail polish for my mother. She loved it. She loved the color. It was a great price for such nice nail polish.
5,I love this book!,"I may be a little biased, but one year my friend's fiance that just moved to the USA from London visited another friend's classroom and read this book to the children. He ""practiced"" reading this book beforehand to his finance's pet cat, and every time he said ""Buck-Buck the Chicken"" she and I cracked up! I recently found out that they are expecting, so I just had to find them a copy of Buck-Buck the Chicken for him to read to his son!"
5,HOME NETWORK OVER YOUR HOUSE POWER LINES,"Wow, the NETGEAR XE103G worked as advertised as soon as I plugged them into the wall electrical sockets and attached ethernet cables! No more low signal warnings, just pure speed at any location in my house. I saw significant gains in speed as soon as I plugged in my laptop using an Ethernet cable. I have never seen a ""plug and play"" device work so flawlessly. I'm now thinking of buying the HD unit with 200Mbps versus the XE103G 85Mbps. But, remember power line 85Mbps bets 54Mbps wireless hands down."
4,Worked immediately - fast with no problems,"I would have rated this 5 stars but for the price. It seems a bit expensive and if wireless had been an answer probably the way I would have gone. I have been having wireless network problems and wanted something that would extend my lan in the house without lots of wiring. This is a great answer. I read the directions (made sure it was not plugged into a power strip), plugged in near my router, went upstairs, plugged it in there and it worked, no problems and as fast as when right next to the router.I must admit there was also a somewhat unresearched idea that my data is safer on a wire network than wireless, even with the encryption that I used when my wireless worked."
4,Delivers as promised but not anywhere near 85Mbps,"These puppies worked well as soon as I plugged them in. With 4 adapters (2 kits) I get between 15 and 25 Mbps all over the house. I use them to connect my TIVOs for multi-room viewing and they are plenty fast to transfer my recordings around. I also have one connected to a WIFI access point to extend my 802.11g network to the basement, which doesn't have a good signal from my primary access point.I'm not sure how sensitive the adapters are to particular wiring but I did notice that on one outlet I got 25 Mbps and one right next to it I got 17Mbps (different circuits). I have a recently-built house and am not sure whether the performance would vary with an older electrical system."
5,I found these adapters to be as easy to use as plug n play,I have a newer construction home and was worried that these ehternet adapters might not be compatible with my home wiring. They work beautifully. These were purchased to connect my Slingbox AV to the home network. I simply plugged one of them into the wall receptacle and the router and the other into the wall receptacle and Slingbox and was ready to go. I have since purchased the wireless extender. This is a very good product.
2,Inconsistent performance,"I was excited about this product, but was disappointed when I hooked it up. It hooked up in a matter of seconds, and I was pleased to find that it connected to my router right away. I was surfing the net in no time.But, within 5 minutes my connection got lost. Then it would come back, then it would drop...very frustrating. I got tired of it and packed it up and sent it back."
4,It works Great... one glitch though,"I bought this item because I didn't have any room for my AOI (printer/Fax/copier) and all my PC stuff in one area. I thought I get a powerline Net adapter and use my house wiring to be my network for my AOI. I plugged it in and within 5 minutes the network was Up an running. Web access anywhere in house... Printing from wireless laptop and well happy days for all.The only glitch I have found, since I leave my AOI ON all the time, is that if your power blinks OFF/ON, the item on the constantly ON side of the network adapter needs to be power cycled to get back on the net for some reason. I got no clue why this is, but that's what I found out; otherwise it works fawlessly."
4,Almost perfect,"I have a long thin house with a broadband feed/router at one end, a spouse's office at the other and a couple of computers in between. With all the cable and switches it seemed I was forever restarting something in the network to keep my spouse happy. No more. I plugged one of these puppies in to the wall and connected it to a lan port on the router, walked to the other end of the house, plugged the other into the wall and connected my spouse's switch. It just worked. I give it four stars because the units feel kinda cheap and plasticky and it doesn't take much of a nudge to dislodge the cable from the unit (I have jumpy feet while I'm working). If the price drops a bit in the future I may get rid of the ethernet cabling all together."
5,Awesome,I'd been using wireless for gaming for the past 3 months and always had lag problems even if the latency said it was around 50. I got the set of these and they work awesome. Just plug one into an outlet next to your pc and one next to your router. Run the cat5 cables from one to the pc and one to the router and you are all set. Now I can do my gaming without the lag I got from wireless and have yet to have any problem with these. These are truly plug and play. Now if only they were a little cheaper.
4,Some stats,"Ok, here's the skinny.With Tivo's wireless adapter it took 21 hours to download a two hour movie.With the XE103 it takes three hours or 700% faster.With Tivo's wireless adapter, youtube video took three time their length to download.With the XE103 they stream.I would have given five stars if I could have streamed movies, but I am still happy with this product overall."
1,"Gambling, losing and product return.","I've seen spotty reviews on the technology, but I had a need at home and on several client sites for a bridge option the tech offered, so I decided to try it out. After many hours of isolating circuits, disassembling the service box to determine the bus bar phase layout, etc. I gave up on the units due to intermittent and slow connectivity. The software that came with them was clunky, slow and resource intensive and did nothing to assist with connection diagnosis. After two days, I reactivated my wireless bridge setup (WRT54GL w/DD-WRT; works like a champ except when the microwave is on.)"
1,any wireless solution could beat it,"after I got these adapters home, the first thing I did is to try it on one outlet panel. Yes, two adapters next to each other on one power outlet panel on the wall. Guess what's the speed on QCheck? 20Mbps. And for a distance my $30 802.11g router can give 4~5Mbps, this power-line adapters only give 2Mbps."
1,Worked great......for a month,"I bought this stuff and brought it to Chile. It actually worked great...until, one month later, one of the adapters broke down. Funny thing is that neither Amazon nor Netgear could give me a feasible solution to exchange the faulty product. Now I have to send this thing back to the US, so they can declare it faulty and give me an exchange (or a refund). Amazingly, Netgear has a tech support in Buenos Aires....that, of course, cannot take part in this claim, because the item wasn't purchased in south america.Bottom line...if you don't live in the US, don't buy it."
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this product to extend internet into a room that did not have a hard wired connection, however, the product only worked when each of the XE 103s were on different outlets in the same room. When I placed the second XE103 15 feet away but in a different room, I was not able to connect. The blue light and the green lights don't help much in troubleshooting, as they can all stay on and you still don't have connectivity. Netgear support is painful and frustrating. And they tell you the product won't work if the rooms are on different circuit breakers, which is very often the case for different rooms. If you do buy this product, make sure you can return it."
5,Fantastic product!,"I'd read the mostly - but not unanimously - favorable reviews for this product, and I was halfway expecting it not to live up to its claims. We have a large Xerox color laser printer with an Ethernet connection in a room down the hall from our network router, and I REALLY didn't want to have to run 100' of Ethernet cable around door frames (or run a cable up through the attic) just to connect it to the network. But we needed a solution to get it running - and fast. When I received these adapters, I followed the very easy instructions, and literally 2 minutes later I was able to print via our wireless network (Airport). Seriously, I am impressed with how quickly these were up and running, and I really appreciate not having ugly cabling running across our walls. So far they have been working flawlessly. These were well worth the investment. Highly recommended."
5,Easy to use! Works Great!,Netgear did it right with this product. Just plug it in and it works. No complicated router instructions to worry about. It has replaced my wireless network (where I frequently had dead spots) and now every pc in the house works great. I've also hooked it up to my TiVo machines to access the programing through the internet rather than using a phone line. I found a great feature was browsing my computer files through my TiVo machine on my TV and setting up a slide show for my family pictures. All done through the Netgear Wall-Plug unit. TERRIFIC! I recommend this highly.
5,this is amazing,"All im gonna say is that this is one of the best rammstein albums,all their albums rule.Mutter is a great heavy album that you will love all the songs are incredible,screw nu metal oh and by the way ""ES IST ZEIT FUR RACHE!"" HELL YEAH!"
5,"Simply a Fantastically written CD, with Power and Art!","I don't want to add to the fine comments of the previous reviewers. But I must say I am simply amazed at the power of their art, the clean clear and gentleness of melody and counter point. This is Rock and Roll not Bach Partitas, so shouldn't it be reckless and ""noice"". On the contrary, After hearing their fine efforts on the Heartbreak CD, the progress to Mutter is simply amazing. Comparing the two, Mutter the more mature, more deliberate, more inventive and less ""in a hurry"" then Heartbreak.I most admire the base lines, classical string treatments and melody inventions. More so because I was raised on Rachmannoff, Lizst, Brahms, and Copeland. There is a classic sense in this Rammstein music. It will bear watching for many years.Also, pardon me for being 55 years old but I find many good things in their lyrics and style and listening to this ""...will not infect your soul and cause the country to lose the war"". Quite the opposite... :)"
5,A Concealed Masterpiece,"Rammstein is one of the best bands out there. I think some shy away because of the fact that it is a German group, but they shouldn't. If this heavy metal band were American breed, they'd be the top dawg. However, because they aren't, they don't get much airplay on the radio. The thing that makes Rammstein so special is their diversity and consistency. The best song on the album is ""Zwitter"" but other hidden gems are ""Rein Raus"", ""Mutter"". ""Links 234"", ""Sonne"", and ""Ich Will"" are the three singles by the group, and the XXX single ""Feur Frei"" is probably the worst song on the album and its a good song!"
5,The best CD from Rammstein yet!,"I've been a fan of Rammstein for a while when I heard they were working on a new CD. I waited for nearly a year for it to come out. I bought it the day it was released. Listening to it in my car on the way home, I was awestruck! Rammstein had evolved into a musical monster! Now there are guitar solos and complicated drum beats! The guitars are featured more and Till's voice is erie as ever! It is by far the heavist, most musical Rammstein CD ever! It is my new favorite. If you have any intrest in hard rock, buy this CD. You will thank me."
5,another excellent album,"I've only had the chance to listen through this CD once so far today, but I can tell ya, if you're a Rammstein fan, you will be pleased. There aren't as many cold riffs (which I thought was bad at first), but really they've grown musically over the past few years.. you can feel their new emotion with the music. There seem to be a lot more odd electronic samples used in the songs too.. and every now and then in the middle of a tune you'll be treated to some of their old hard ways.BUY THIS CD! Or try to get the enhanced one if it exists.."
5,Feuer Frei!,"Great album. Power and energy to the vein.I really believe music influences my day and my state of mind.Sicne im listening to Rammstein on a daily basis i feel i got more energy to do more stuff. Im like the rabbit from duracell... i go on, and on, and on....This is a great album you should listen before your football game so you kick everyones a**With songs like Feuer Frei!, Mein Herz Brennt, Adios, Links 2 3 4 you will have enogh energy to playa 24 hour game!"
4,Definitely the BEST Rammstein cd,"I bought this cd last July after someone I liked said Rammstein was one of her favorite bands - and now I know why. ""Mutter"" is the cd that started my whole German rock/industrial phase. It's worth every cent.The most memorable songs on the album are Mein Herz Brennt, Links 234, Feuer Frei, Sonne, Ich Will, Adios, and Mutter. This album is pure quality and just as catchy as any American industrial album. Give it a shot."
3,"Not amazing, but a worthy cd","My main complaint with this cd is that it is pretty simple music for my progressive metal tastes. Generally the songs stay on one time signature and have only 2 or 3 riffs throughout the entire song....and yet, I find myself putting this in over Opeth or Nightwish or Dream Theater or Nevermore sometimes. Why? I think, despite their flaws and nu-metal associations (I do not think they are nu-metal, but being popular and metal apparently automagically makes you nu-metal to some people), Rammstein have a unique sound to their music that makes it worthwhile to listen to occasionally. Recommended if you want something different in your metal diet."
4,"A very good, but lookalike!","This album is very strong and good. The first six songs are very good, but it's all lookalike, the same with the other five songs, the worst song is Reinraus, and the best are Ich Will, Feuer Frei and Sonne. The others are all good, but when listening to the whole cd, it starts boring after Mutter.Keep on rocking!!"
5,3/4 Albums so far. AND ALL OF THEM ROCK!,Mein Herz Brent[10/10]Links 2 3 4[10/10]Sonne[10/10]Ich Will[10/10]Feuer Frei![10/10]Mutter[10/10]Spieluhr[10/10]Zwitter[10/10]Rein Raus[10/10]Adios[10/10]Nebel[10/10]
5,"Teutonic mad men spawned the best cd ever. ""MUTTER!","If you listened to ""mutter"" then you'll soon see why americascrazed about the six german masters of dark metal. They spawned their success with ""Herzeleid"" now making their forth album the best. On ""Sonne"", Tills voice of an end of the world theme makes the song one of the best. ""Mutter"" with it's a more mello-dramtic touch has it's advantages toward any mello theme by todays modern rock. (...). ""Nebel"" with it's creepy sounds has a high point meaning BoBO (Female vocalist in ""engel"" and special versions of ""Alter mann"") sounding beautiful as ever in the back grounds with Till hitting the high notes and sounding wonderful as ever. Get Rammstein! Then enjoy."
2,SLOW DELIVERY,"I am a big Rammstein fan, but i ordered this cd over 3 months ago and it still hasn't arrived. If I wanted to buy this cd, i would just go to the store to purchase it."
5,Classic Metal Album.,"Mutter is probably the most representative Rammstein album of them all. I have all of their CD's and DVD's available in the states, and this album is almost a greatest hits album all by itself. Aside from Du Hast, all of their most popular songs in the states are on this album. If you're just starting your Rammstein collection, this is a great place to start, but don't stop at this one. Rammstein has proven that they know how to make great music again and again. Perhaps the best metal/industrial band EVER!!!"
5,Classic Rammstein,"I loved ""Du Hast"" the first time I heard the song. The music was loud and abrasive yet melodic like their German brethren the legendary KMFDM. ""Mutter"" quickly picks up where ""Sehnsucht"" leaves off but with better production and the inclusion of the strings in their brand of metal/industrial music. I love ""Sehnsucht"" but ""Mutter"" totally blew that album away. The songs are heavier,louder, and angrier. Considering the tone of mood in this country this past week, ""Mutter"" is an excellent album to vent out one's frustrations to the terrorists who crashed the WTC, Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. I may not understand a lick of German but I can certainly hear the angst filled throughout the entire album. I loved how the band incorporated a string section in songs like ""Spieluhr"" and ""Rein Raus"". The string section and the thunderous raging industrial beats compliments each other I think. I am going to have to place ""Mutter"" as another favorite album of 2001. Just killer music."
2,No no no,I don't like Rammstein. It's not the kind of music I listen to. But if you like buy it! Cuz it's from Germany! *hehe*
1,ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRggggggggggggg,Maybe interesting if u don't understand the lyrics -> I do and thing about it...
1,NECROPHAGIST can destroy rammstein with a single riff.,"NECROPHAGIST is the only Real Metal Band from Germany that matters, they are a million times better than that Power Metal Junk and Electronica based mainstream Rammstein.Want proof? listen to their album ""Epitaph"" and die!"
4,Very good,"Better than the last Album, but not as good as the first. Has some excellent songs, such as Mutter, Ich Will, and Sonne. Rammstein are great, singing in that voice in German with those heavy riffs makes it sound so damn good."
5,Ich liebe deise cd!,"Wow, Rammstein drops the bomb again, and its nothing short of deadly. A great cd put out by one of my favorite bands, and even greater when I can understand most of it. Guess german lessons pay off, eh?Well the top song here for me is ""Sonne"". Great song, has a catchy tune, and is very undieing. Sticks in the head for days to come.So remember, Rammstein is not specific to any social group. Being a goth, I must say that I love the organs and choir pieces. But others will love other parts!Pick it up now before I kick your teeth in, Du krank katze."
5,Schönheit in der Kraft,"That means ""beauty in strenght"", and that's exactly what this album stands for. ""Mutter"" is a brilliant album in every aspect. Songwriting is superb, the songs being concise, heavy yet melodic, with a beautiful sadness in all of them. Lyrics are also quite good. The album sounds pretty cool, the bone-crunching guitars match perfectly with the delicate, melodic synths. Till's vocals are much more mature than in the past 2 albums, they're very emotional and real. ""Mutter"" shows that neo-metal can go beyond the ""doom-and-gloom"" lyrics and the A.D.I.D.A.S. aesthetics: love, loss and compassion can actually be shown without losing a bit of strenght. Excellent album."
4,Almost perfect!,"This album is a bit too short, and doesn't compare with Gary Numan or anything down that line, but Mutter has no bad songs. I love this music. In track 3 you can almost feel the lead singer's emotions as he cries in the chorus. If I knew German though, I'm very sure part of the music of listening to Rammstein would be killed."
5,Rammstein's best CD,"This is probably Rammstein's best CD. This CD has 11 songs. All which are great. But there is one thing that you should keep in mind before ordering this. At Best Buy.(Nation Wide) They sell this CD if I remember right for 14.99. And. It had 2 discs. Im not sure If this one does. But on the second disc of the one best buy sells it has their music video ""Sonne"" Which is in great quailty. And another song halleujah. So I would say get this CD, But by it at best buy."
4,Fuckin' Rock Harrrrrd,"Ich muss ehrlich zugeben, dass Rammstein echt merde sind. Gut für euch. Danke Jungens."
2,First half is good,"Whats the deal with the 5 star reviews here? This is not a 5 star album even if you are a fanboy. 1-6 is good solid stuff, but the rest of the album is quite repetative and boring. ALot of very boring and predictible riffs and drumming. I know that they are not a technical band but I could easily snooze through most of the songs they aren't too creative. I am a fan of their other albums though because those ones are better written than this."
3,It's pretty cool but not what sensucht or herzereleid was,"Yeah it's cool, its awesome but it can't beat the sweet jams of sensucht and herzeleid."
3,Very different from the anime,"The only thing that this manga has in common with the popular anime are the names, and perhaps Allen. Character designs and personalities are very different. The story has some similar plot threads, probably enough to interest hardcore Escaflowne fans.I liked the anime somewhat, but the manga doesn't really have any of the same beauty or magic that was added to the anime. Still, the artwork is attractive, and it is still has a few unique elements for a fantasy manga."
1,Not very good,"Although this manga in future volumes has it's moments, it's not very good. It was written and published after the anime had started. This is not the original story! For fans of Katsu Aki's works (Psychic Academy, Futari Ecchi) This was one of his first manga. The art is pretty average, the plot has very little to do with the anime. The Characters, except for the names, act Very differently. Personally, i disliked this series quite a bit. For a manga that sold only decently in japan (and if at all, only because it had the Escaflowne name), It's a wonder to me that they licensed something so... ick. Then again, with the exception of a few titles, tokyopop loves to license lots of these obscure manga."
4,heart bursting out of his chest,"I was a lowly late night disc jockey at a small college when I first heard ""bang,bang..."". It went on high rotation. Best cuts - Tinker,Tailor & Without Expession - still have the vinyl! What a voice & what soul! For all those wanting ""Highway 61"", I have the vinyl ""Move Over For... Terry Reid"". Best cuts - stay with me baby; may fly; & rich kid blues. I wish I still had my ""River""! Love the man."
4,Loveitloveitloveitalwaysalwayshave,"I have loved this album since first discovering it in a box of my dad's old records and have become his self-proclaimed patron saint ever sinse. No one I talk music with escapes my rambling tributes to him. Has its dated moments, but the guitar intro to ""Tinker Tailor"", the steady, exciting climb of ""Something's gotten into my Heart"", and the fact that no song has been recorded that sounds anything like the crazy ""Bang,Bang"" more than make up for its few faults. Very, very glad its finally on disc. But how much longer will I have to wait for ""River""?"
2,A copy of Hitch,"This is a copy of Hitch where Salman Khan plays the role of Will Smith. Katrina Kaif plays the role of Eva Mendes, and Govinda is the Indian Kevin James. There is not much difference between Partner and Hitch except that Partner is a Hindi movie, and therefore a little Indian Masala (Spice) is added to it in the form of some hilarious comedy. Raj Pal Yadav's character of Chota Don is very funny.Since this is a Hindi movie, it extends a little longer than Hitch. If you have seen Hitch and loved it, I would suggest not to watch Partner because Partner comes nowhere near Hitch."
3,If 3.5 stars was an option..,"AYE, this book drove me NUTS! I read until she grew up, and then I took 2 weeks off the book because the story was already so real. It made me depressed just because I know this happens to people.Once I picked the book back up I got really into the story. LH writes great, strong characters so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.The storyline was well, and real, but for some reason this book just didn't blow me away like the others. It was a great story, and worth the time, just not her best."
5,Can I give it a million stars?,"Okay, where to begin? This is without a doubt one of the best romance books that I've read since ""Outlander."" Yes, it's that good. The bathroom scene alone was worth the price of admission. The only glitch in an otherwise fantastic book was the heroine, Faith. I found her to be a bit feeble at times...maybe a little too emotionally crippled. But, a small complaint, nonetheless. Gripping/emotionally charged storyline, super-sexy hero, intense and fun sex scenes, and interesting sub-characters. What more could a reader ask for?"
3,"it was a good book, got a question though","If gray's father really fell inlove with the woman who is married, what in the world was he doing with the heroinnes mother? He was so inlove he was still sleeping around on her? it just made it seem a little fake that someone ""in love"" would go sleep with some [slovenly] woman while the woman he supposedly loves is stuck married with a jerk."
3,Bleah!,"A largely-passive heroine with a jerk for the ""hero""/love interest. Love story didn't ring true. Expect to see this couple in divorce court in a year or so. At least it wasn't as bad as ""Dream Man."" Don't waste your time on either book or (sorry, Ms. Howard) on this author's work."
4,WONDERFUL !!!!!,"This is the first book by Linda Howard I read, but it won't be the last. I could not put it down !!"
3,Mediocore - not Linda Howard's best.,"This book disapointed me. I found the main characters as well as the plot unintersting. The style is forced and although well developed. Linda Howard has written better, much better"
5,Linda Howard's After the Night is a hot read!,I recently read After the Night. I enjoyed both the primary and secondary plots. Faith is a woman driven to provide a place for herself and to resolve old conflicts with the one man who has haunted her all of her life. The hero is a man used to getting what he wants. The settings are rich in texture the sex it hot and steamy. The subplot of murder holds your interest and the secondary characters are also richly drawn. If you like Linda Howard books you will love this book. This one is a keeper
5,One of her best,"Linda really hit her stride in the 90's. ""After the Night,"" ""Dream Man,"" and ""Shades of Twilight"" are some of her best works. Guy's character is a little dated, described with a ponytail and earring, but otherwise the storyline and romance is excellent."
3,Not much Suspense Here!,"I bought this book based on the reviews and the first two pages I read in the bookstore. I had Mr.Perfect in my other hand. I wish I would have gotten it instead.But I had to see for myself what all the praise was all about.I did finish this book quickly, but I was not that impressed.The book begins well but Faith is not the kind of woman I hoped she'd turn out to be.Grey is an abusive man even in the sexual content of this book.What women would seriously live her life out this way? Hopefuly very very few.My three stars are for the first portion of the book, before Faith grows up."
3,I Liked it!,"I really would give this book 3.5 stars if I could. I liked the premise of the story, the idea of a wealthy man falling for the girl who used to be from the wrong side of the tracks.I liked the fact that Faith had a crush on Gray since she was a a young girl and that it never that really died down, but in fact grew into love as she grew older compelling. The idea that there was a slight age difference was also a good idea becuase he couldn't reciporicate the atttraction when she was so young. She was able to build her life and become successful. Then she was able to move back to Prosper and present herself as the successful lady she had become.The mystery added to the story was also good although the identity of the person who committed the murder was a bit predictable. That could be figured out from the very beginning.The chemistry between Faith and Gray was really good. I wish it had ended a bit differently but overall it was a good read."
5,One of her best (one of many),I read this book in 1998 and have continued to reread it again and again through out the years. Linda Howard is a talented author who can combine mystery and romance perfectly. If you like both you will love this book.
5,Howard just gets better and better,This is one of her best. I could not put it down. The characters were so strong and so well drawn I felt as if I knew them. Worth every penny!
5,Great! Up to her usual high quality,"I was disappointed that you put a lengthy tirade against this book at the beginning of what are a series of great reviews. I read everything Linda Howard writes and the language used is real life along with the strong emotions of desire, love and hate. Linda Howard always makes her people human, i.e. Gray's fear of haircuts! I say, Linda, keep up this winning style."
5,A GREAT READ,"I really enjoyed this book. The public restroom part was hilarious, and the part when Gray throw's Faith out of her home made me cry. I liked the fact that Faith isnt some helpless female who cant make it without a man.And Gray well his character is adorable.I picked this book because I read so many good reviews on it, and I'm so glad that I was'nt dissapointed."
5,One of my favorites from Linda Howard,"I'm just an average person but I'm an avid reader. I first discovered Linda Howard in Death Angel and I was hooked. This book is amazing, the depth of the characters, the plot, the emotions. I was so involved in this book that reality ceased to exist for me.The part (trying not to give too much away) where Faith is gathering up the items from the front of the house and everyone is standing around watching her just broke my heart.If you're on the fence about this book, take a chance and leap, it's worth it."
4,Steamy romance with great hero!,"""After the Night"" is exactly what I was looking for: a contemporary, steamy, fairy tale with just enough of a twist to keep me turning those pages but not enough to keep me from a good night's sleep.The sex is fantastic, hot as they get. The hero, Gray (**fans herself to keep from swooning**), is serious worship material, up there with the best of them. He's funny too, and enough of a bad boy to inspire even the coldest of us. Faith, the heroine, is likable and sympathetic and absolutely gorgeous. Their romance is credible, the chemistry is to die for (I expected no less considering the fact that Gray was cajun), the sex is enough to burn up the pages. The plot was interesting, though at times it very much needed a strong ""suspension of disbelief"" in order to accept the story.This isn't Linda Howard's best, but it was so satisfying a read I can't possibly not rate it with 4 stars.It is the literary equivalent of comfort food."
2,NOT As Good as It Gets!!!,"I have to say that I was disappointed with this book. This is not the kind of romance I enjoy. It was vulgar, the hero was crude and the heroine enjoyed it. I found myself getting disgusted with the hero and wanting to tell the heroine to ""WAKE UP!"". I also guessed how the ending was going to turn out so not much suspense there."
5,I Just Had TO Give This Book Five Stars.,"I don't give too many books five stars but I couldn't see any other way around it. Not only did L. Howard write an entertaining story, but she created a nearly flawless hero, even though he was by no means perfect. If you like your males ALPHA and demanding but not abusive then Gray Rouillard is the man for you to spend a day or two between the covers (of the book, of course)with.And about the heroine, she had a lot of character and a strong backbone to overcome her ugly childhood. But in this case perseverance paid off. She won the (sigh) hero.If I had any complaints, it would be that the book could have been a wee bit longer. I would have liked Faith to be able to find her mother and the rest of her family even though they had not been good to her. And for us to be there for the wedding would have been nice.If you have not read this book, I do recommend it."
4,Whew! Pass the Ice Water!,"This is my first Linda Howard book. At the beginning I thought there was too much story about nothing, but that quickly changed. This book was well worth the read. Oh, and that bathroom scene was absurdly comical - LOVED IT! I would definitely recommend this book for those who love a good story and a wonderful, sensual romance. I will definitely read Linda Howard again."
4,It is what It is,"Both the people who hated it and the people who loved it are right in my opinion. This an 80's Romance novel, complete with GORGEOUS Alpha male and the swooning hopelessly in love woman. Though to give Faith her due, she may be hopelessly in love, but she is a very capable young woman with demonstrated qualities such as perseverence, caring and loyalty. And Gray may be a macho jerk, but he makes a woman's blood MOVE.The chemistry between the characters basically rolled off the pages with great big waves of steam. The mystery was very well crafted with plenty of twists along the way. The character development was excellent, and even though you might not always agree with their actions, their motivation and reasoning were well supported.I've enjoyed reading this book many times. It's great entertainment."
5,5 stars all the way! Great read.,"Faith is a young girl, whose father and older brothers are drunks and trouble makers. Her mother has a loose reputation and is mistress to a wealthy man. The family is run out of town, Faith is humiliated, ends up in a foster home, studies hard, makes something of herself which is impressive. She is a neat character to follow. Gray is the rich man's son who is drawn to Faith, yet hates her because of her mother's affair with his father. There is a good mystery, a killer, and love. An excellent read. Sexual content: moderate. Copyright: 1995. Genre: contemporary romantic suspense."
4,Sensually good read,"I guessed one of the ""bad guys"" but not the other one! It'll keep you guessing and rooting for Faith when whe returns to her hometown. Gray is a meanie who does a 180 in the end."
5,Again & Again,I loved this book. I could not put it down. And once I was done reading it I wanted to read it again and again. I still have it on my nightstand ready for me to pick it up and start all over. Linda Howard is a great author and I'm getting ready to start another one of her books. I can't wait!!!
1,Horrible,I guess I'm one of the minority who really detested this book. The romance sucked but what's more is just how horrible the writing was. Did Howard really write this trash?
1,wow....,"I usually love Linda Howard, but wow. I know im gonna get blasted but... the last thing i ever wanna read in any book is the suffering and death of a child - ESPECIALLY IN A ROMANCE BOOK. What kind of woman would ever want anything to do with a guy who allowed a child to be treated like that? HE watched as two innocent children, crying and terrified in the middle of the night while being thrown out of their house,and did nothing. This ruined the whole book for me, and he never even said he was sorry. Not sure it would have made a difference anyway."
5,One of my Linda Howard favorites - top 3,"I love the stories where there's an unconsumated attraction between the characters and then they're suddenly thrown back together many years later to find the time/distance only made the attraction more intense. Faith is a fantastic heroine and Howard draws you into her emotional struggle to go back home and face the demon of her family's bad reputation. The sparks between Faith and Gray (the man who's father ran away with Faith's trashy mother years ago) are abundant, especially while he tries to run her out of town to avoid reopening old wounds."
1,tawdry,"If there were a 0 stars rating, this book would get it. I thought it a waste of paper. And yes, I ADORE Linda Howard & devour everything she writes. This one, I could barely read. I found it impossible to relate to the heroine and the hero - and I use those terms loosely! The ""hero"" was just plain mean; the ""heroine"" lacked pride, backbone, and common sense. Where was her brain? No, don't answer that. Maybe there are ""characters"" like them out in real life, but if there are, I don't want to read about them. The relationship (and again, I use that term loosely) between the two main character is tawdry, abusive, demeaning, twisted, and just plain out sick. Let the psychiatrists read the book and try to figure out the warped minds of the characters. The majority of the reviews raved about the ""hot"" sex scenes. Those scenes left me ""cold"" because there was no loving, no romancing, no sharing, no caring, no giving, no uniting.....as my title indicates,to me it was just plain TAWDRY!"
3,Repeats itself all over,"Ok the idea of this book is great. However, really getting tired of reading the same things over and over again every 10 pages or so. Seems the book has only a few things to say and I bet I could have read MSDN for the info I am getting.Who knows perhaps after page 100 something new will be said."
1,Oh my Gosh!,Only tasteless people would buy this garbage! Look at its ranking! Its a really bad CD! Really Bad!
3,Bad judgment as historical injustice,Elliot Horowitz tries to make a new reading of Jewish history as a whole. He wants to argue for the idea that violence on the part of Jews has been in the Diaspora an important and predominant factor. However the number of illustrations he can muster to prove his point is few. And what he does instead is provide a skewed misreading of Diaspora Jewish history as whole.It may be true that Jewish history for two thousand years consists in more than victimization. But there is no proportion whatsoever between the horrifying violence done to Jews in these years to the trifling in comparison violence done by them.
3,My dog hates them :(,"My dog has bad knees and needs to wear rubber-soled shoes on his back feet as he slips and injures himself on our wood floors. I started with sandals but his ""toes"" kept sticking out and getting caught. I bought these thinking they'd stay on better - uhm, no. I know his size from the sandals, so I bought a 3. The leg part is the right size and I could go no smaller, but the foot part is so loose they SPIN on his feet! This would only be good for a larger dog ... I suppose one that has really tiny feet! The shoes themselves are great quality, though... just not wearable in the size they're made."
5,Another WINNER!,"Yep! I call ""Photoshop CS - Creative Studio"" as another winner from Peachpit Press! Although a strong basic working knowledge of Photoshop is required to make the best use of this book, even a novice would benefit from the hundreds of time saving tips, shortcuts and appendices. The creative exercises are clear and concise. This is a real ""nuts and bolts"" sort of recipe book... no dry or unwanted ""humor"" to wade through, just a LOT of real INFORMATION! (This is NOT an instructional book for Photoshop, but a creative supplement). As an ""intermediate level"" user of Photoshop CS, I found this publication to be an extremely valuable creative resource."
2,A Sense Of Place,I expected a more classical collection than this is. I should have researched the CD in a more thorough manner.
3,Smeared with atmosphere,"Next to a noticeable debut, Wyatt's quick follow up can feel sloppily rushed, but still manages to offer enough notes-for-thought to justify a listen."
1,Save Your Money,"Robert Wyatt has his moments, and this band was capable of some great work, but this CD is best used as a coaster for your beer can. After one listein I hurried down to the used CD store to help them rotate their stock with it. Caveat emptor!"
2,Little Red Record,"The little ""red"" record sleeve is of much more interest than the disc it holds. Based on a Chinese People's Army's poster, this perversion of Maoism could have caused them a lot of grief had they landed in the society of their passion and fascination."
5,A Great Advice Giver,"Even though this book is classified as a how-to, it felt like more like a reader to me. It is almost as though Frances Manos was my neighbor, having her impart her garden experience over the fence or a cup of coffee.This book gives advice on how to create beautiful cottage gardens. You will learn the secrets of using perennials, annuals, fruits and vegetables to make your garden unique and wonderful all at the same time.Her writing style is easy to read and encouraging, not pushy or boastful. You can feel her enthusiasm for getting others to garden as you read this book. Although this book takes a while for you to get into, you need to read it from the beginning to end so that you don't miss out on anything."
4,"Very mild with some subtle orange flavor, and distinct bitterness","This is a high-quality chocolate made with all natural ingredients, but not my favorite. It's got a very mild taste that to me is very far from chocolate. It lacks that smooth, fatty rich taste on the tongue. The bitterness, however, is definitely in here when you first chew it, with an orange-y finish that increases in intensity in your mouth. It's an interesting effect, but I can't say that I love this. The bitterness lingers for a while, so be aware if you're used to very sweet chocolates.According to what little German that I can understand, this chocolate is handmade (since 1890) and made without coloring or preservatives. It's beautifully wrapped and makes a wonderful gift (I got it from a German friend), but just be sure that the person likes bitter chocolate before you buy this. Price written on the back is 2.2 Euro."
1,It's Hard-Fantasy,"When I got this book it jumped ahead of my big backlog of 'to be read' books cause I was intrigued to find out about these children who had special abilities yet were 'imprisoned' in a special school designed especially for them.I found the book interesting up until the point they 'discovered' their origins and then the book became very hard reading. Once they discovered who they were the development of the characters felt a distant third to the overwhelming greek mythology element introduced and the constant barrage of the other characters questionable morals & ethics.If when you read a book you need to like the characters in it I would recommend to avoid this book, it is not for you. When I describe the genre of this book to people I would call it Hard Fantasy, so if you enjoy Hard SF you may find it interesting (so long as you have an ok knowledge of greek mythology)."
2,just not enough here,"This book feels incredibly incomplete. The author has an intriguing idea and the plot sounds interesting, but ultimately both the story and the characters are barely developed. This entire book should be condensed into half the pages and included as part of a larger story. It does not stand on its own and unless you are a huge fan of the author or love greek mythology I would not recommend wasting your time and money."
2,Strangely disappointing...,"I found this book at my local library. The story sounded interesting, as a few other reviewers noted, like an adult Harry Potter. The book's narrator, Amelia, is a teenage (?) girl who's really not sure about her age or why she and her 4 fellow orphans are the only students at their school. Amelia suspects that there are secret powers and mysterious worlds just beyond her grasp. I enjoyed the first 100 or so pages, but when the author starts to reveal the true nature of the children and their keepers, things start to go downhill. Wright now tries to give all the background information - and there's a lot of it - to explain Amelia's world and why she's at the school. I am an avid reader and I really struggled to get through the remainder of the book. Too much historical background and explanation really brings the tale to a standstill. Though, I'm curious to discover Amelia's fate, I do not think that I'll be reading any more books in this series."
1,multi-dimensionally dissappointing,"Beginning the book, I was nervous that the different qualities of the children would turn out to make them one more version of mutant superheroes. But the opening is good, appealing, atmospheric. And the book builds well at the outset, developing characters with mystery and interest. Then we encounter the ancient gods who speak smart-aleck and the relationships with the ""young adults"" becomes only puerile and lascivious. Ponderous physics speculation became the high point. I got halfway through; I see other reviewers say it ended on a cliffhanger. I will not waste more time with it. The sexual mores especially were disturbing, the lack of a world with any interest just depressing."
3,Worthwile!,"This was definately a novel worth reading. I look forward to gettibg my hands on the next installment. Mr. Wright has a way with words that i found delighful, though I did have to stop and look a few of them up."
2,SLAVE GIRLS OF GOR in 4-D,"I enjoyed this cleverly constructed fantasy with mythological themes, but am troubled by the domination & submission storyline for the (four-dimensional!) female protagonist, which from the evidence of this first volume is really nothing more than SLAVE GIRLS OF GOR in a PG-13 mask."
4,cables,"get this, 3 Y adapters, 3 RCA couplers, an AC/DC converter and let the kids play video games in the car on long trips."
4,CD showcases Toby's soulful voice,"This album is beautiful! Her voice shines through this one more than her debut album because there's not as much going on in the songs to compete with her voice. I hear a retro vibe going on and the first song made me think of Carol King. The sound is much simpler and I think this one is more of a showcase as to what she is capable of. There are fast and slow songs, retro and modern which just makes me love the album!"
4,Toby finds her voice!,"Toby is back and has found her voice with ""Bird On A Wire!"" Her first album, although polished and catchy, lacked a solid, directional voice. Stripped and emotional, her second album presents what she's really all about - strong, beautiful vocals over live instrumentation. Yes, Toby has abandoned the synthesized drums and production found on ""Little Things"" and has adopted a live performance vibe for the studio...and you can tell she feels at home. (Personally - I didn't mind the pop-produced Toby, but these songs and this sound are better for Toby as an artist.) The album exudes an egoless confidence - her vocals have become even more heart-wrenching and her lyrics notably more assured.""Don't Wake Me"" opens the album with a gospelesque foot-stomper, ""Better,"" ""Slippin,"" and ""Alone"" are the catchiest radio-friendly tracks, ""My Sweet Song"" recalls Motown sentiments, while ""I'd Be Lost"" and ""Good Find"" provide a welcome Nora Jones feel."
3,Better in person,This artist is remarkable. Her voice and style of music is great. I heard her in person last night and she is better than her CD. I bought the Cd and she autographed it which is cool. She has a great personality and is from Jersey which makes her so much better.

3,My favourite album cover of all time,"The cover is of Leo and a guy in a rubber mask in front of Monument Valley. This album also has my favourite ever song title - When Shrimps Learn to Whistle. This also happens to also be my favourite Kottke song. Why then have I only given it 3 stars? I've tried to love the rest of it, but it doesn't hold my attention like so much of his stuff. Sorry to disagree with you Minnesota music fan: I think it may grow on me if I just keep on listening. Here goes!"
3,Useful with caution,"Photographer's Guide to Yellowstone is very useful for finding good photo spots and for choosing the best time to shoot. He also gives a valuable warning about protecting lens from geyserite spray. However his ""how to"" tips can lead to a lot of murky and oversaturated photos, particularly when photographing the blue, azure, and aqua colored hot pools in the thermal areas. Not every shot should be taken with a polarizer!"
5,Great concept.,"I found this book extremely valuable, and I wish similar books were available for every photogenic destination (a few others are). Given limited vacation time in each park (Tetons & Yellowstone), we were able to plan ahead and be at the right place at the right time(s) of day to get excellent shots and then onward to other activities.The author was exactly accurate about what time the rainbows appear from successive North Rim overlooks, for example, and we hiked between them with great results. Ignore the recommendations about filters if you like, but select from the location descriptions to maximize your trip photos of the famous (and semi-secret) views. Yes I brought home a lot of cliche images, but my friends and family don't know that and they're thrilled with the ""classic"" enlargements."
5,Excellent for planning a photo trip to the parks!,"I have used his book to schedule what I will visit and photograph at different times of the day and marked the good locations he described. It will stay in the front seat of my car to check as I go from place to place. I even made a schedule of what to see at sunrise, morning, afternoon, and sunset. I would like to have a book like this for every natural area I plan to visit and photograph. But I basically ignored his suggestions for filters and what seems like an overuse of a polarizer. Otherwise it has been a great help to plan my trip."
3,Semi-useful,"The book gives you all the standard places to shoot and a few not so common ones as well. Geared towards film photographers, it's badly in need of updating to reflect the growing use of digital. Some good advice on shooting times and techniques, relies maybe too much on the use of warming filters. A good resource but not a must-have."
4,A great guide,"As a beginning photographer, I found this guide to be invaluable on our trip to Yellowstone this fall. It is clearly written and complete in its coverage of the park. I would recommend it for anyone from beginners to advanced intermediate photographers."
2,OK for beginners,The Photographer's Guide to Yellowstone and the Tetons is a brief overview for a person with limited experience. Really not for an experienced photographer.
4,Lack of Index,"I would have given the Photographers Guide to Yellowstone & the Titons a 5 Star Rating if there was an index in the back of the book for easy reference while out in the field. It is difficult trying to remember what page the subject that your looking at is on. That being said, it is still a good reference book on the area and I do not regret buying it."
3,An intriguing true story that raises lots of questions,"While I've never believed in ghosts, this family's story rings true and I have no reason to doubt that they did experience something out of the ordinary. The picture of life as modern-day ""homesteaders"" in rural Wisconsin is intriguing and the portrayals of the children are engaging. I happen to know this family, and I know the warmth and sense of values that they bring to being a connected and caring family. The book made me feel that I'd better not make hasty judgments about experiences that I can't immediately understand. Worth reading!"
4,Some ghosts are benevolent!,"The truth is often more amazing than fiction as this true story shows. It centers around three very benevolent ghosts who assume the duties of watching over the family (and their guests) who live in a house where three people have died in days gone by. It's a family story, related by the father and verified through documentation. Since the narrator is an adult, I'd classify the book as for adults. It's high interest with low reading level so that it could be enjoyed by adults learning English as a second language. Kids ages 9-14 would enjoy the story, but they may not like having it related by an adult. Some parents will find the use of an Ouiga board and the consulting of a medium to be objectionable. Nevertheless the story is told well, the characters ring true, and the reader will come away with new ideas to ponder insofar as ghosts are concerned. Recommended for readers who like ghost stories."

3,"Good, solid read, but lacks the depth of High and Low.","King's Ransom seems like a very unlikely source of material for Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, better know for his samurai epics. However, Kurosawa pulled it off brilliantly, making one of his best films. The source book, by Ed McBain, is solid and well written -- and exciting read. However, it lacks the depth and the staying power of High and Low. The story, as told by McBain, is a straightforward detective story. There are no larger issues contemplated than whether Douglas King should pay the ransom for his chauffer's son, mistakenly kidnapped in place of his own son. Kurosawa, in contrast, turned the story into an indictment of Japanese society with its rigid views of where everyone fits in the caste system. We understand Douglas King's motivation, but he never generates the sympathy we feel for Toshiro Mifune's equivalent character in High and Low. It's a good book, but unlike High and Low, it doesn't really stay with you afterwards."
5,Kindle product,This is the first book I have purchased with my new Kindle Fire. I am enjoying the book and love the Kindle.
4,Very good,I was very happy I picked this book. It was hard to put it down. Mysteries like this keep me going. The beginning is a real shocker and keeps your attention.
4,interesting delimma,"This isn't normally the kind of book I read (it being a mystery), but I'm glad I did, because it really wasn't a mystery. More of a suspense or cop story. I like the interesting moral dilemma this book poses..would you pay a half million dollars in ransom for a child that is not your own? And what if paying this ransom ruins you? What would you do? I think McBain could have spent more time on this aspect of the novel. Also, this book contains some of the best dialogues I've seen. I could picture a couple of good actors acting this out on the big screen. The biggest problem i found with the book was McBain wrote it 'soft.' I would've expected more swearing and adult content from kidnappers, but all in all this book is a must."
4,better book for a woman,"Some of Ed Mcbain novels are not good for a woman or at least me. This one was good. some have too many characters and are hard to keep track of who did what. some are too graffic, but this one was good. I didn't have to skip the bad parts."
1,Never Ordered This Book,I never ordered this book from Amazon so I am unable to review it. If this item is shown on my account it is in error.
1,None,this is a tereble book. dont read this book. i dont like the title either. tereble title the kings ransom. title is eh. i rated it one star. do not reread this either. this is not 5 stars. this is only one star.
2,Not So Helpful,"Unfortunately, this book does not provide much immediate help for a couple in trouble or a deeper understanding of relationships. There seems to be a good underlying theory but the stories are not in enough detail to relate to and the practical advice is limited. I believe the author knows this subject deeply but her editors should have caught that someone without that background will be challenged to understand it from this book. On the bright side, start reading this and you may quickly prefer snuggling with your partner."
4,IMAGO IMAGO IMAGO,"A very old Italian song says ""I am the mirroir you dont want to see"" and I could not believe my ears when I heard it. So this concept of projection and Harville's ""imago"" has been around for a while? It is so wonderful to be able to see your own foibles in others and how wonderful life becomes. I also say that inTHE MEMORY OF VINEGAR AND OIL: Origins Unifiedand also in ""You Are Who You Hate: The Healing in Dissonance""."
1,calling all codependents,This book is awful. The premise that you can find a partner who is trainable is ridiculous. Compassionate manipulation should have been the title to this book.Bonnie needs to check out some books about codependency and do some self assessment.
3,OK book for woman,"I read this book thinking ""this book is written by a woman from a woman point of view""....if you are a woman, read this book, and it may be helpful. With me as a man, it did not click too much. Besides, I do not believe in ME, ME ME. What ""I"" Want. I believe in ""What is the best for her"" even if I do not get what ""I"" want, that is all I wish for my partner. I have learned NOT TO cling on to ANYTHING, or ANYONE. Because NOTHING is permanent and is constantly changing including our body and spirit. So why make an effort, just go with the flow regardless of what ""I"" want....What SHE want is more important for me, and will always love her no matter what changes may arise."
3,better than most...,"Besides outright contradictions, this book is pretty helpful. For instance, ""break up with your lover, but don't have any contact, but it's OK to sleep with them. ""(I'm paraphrasing here). Lots and lots of contradictions....; despite that it's a good read and I like the singles section. The examples are less generic then The Passion Trap & Getting to Commitment (the later did not apply at all to any of my issues). I'm pretty sure the guy I've been seeing has already read this book. lol"
1,A disappointing and self-indulgent collection,"Many of these poets are very talented and should have known better than to get involved with a project which is ultimately a selection of the musings of urban sophisticates. Rather than a true tribute to Shepherd, this book is for the most part a showcase of pretentious work that should never have been published. Although there are a few gems (Campo, Hacker), these poems are mostly along the lines of that unfortunate narrative which features a New Yorker walking up the avenue thinking about the planets and a jug of milk: self-indulgent, sloppy, and (if you're lucky) forgettable."
5,Great Fun!,"This is a fun book with an unlikely sleuth. Lots of plot twists, and a nice, healthy dose of simmering lust to boot. And even that has its own plot twist. A good read."
2,Earpiece didn't work,I sent the phone back because the you couldn't hear very well from the ear piece....I turned the volume up as far as it would go and still couldn't hear well.
3,Style slightly slays substance,"3 1/2Wyatt adds more humor to soften the intensity but can (when inclined) jam no less hard, proving his solo worth with this accomplished set of experimental ramblings."
5,An avid reader of futuristics,"Gemini Turns is a futuristic conspiracy against a hardened and dispirited space Captain.The predicament of Earth necessitates trade talks with a fierce Seclusionist alien race and Captain Garrett is coerced into this mission with a dubious crew: two identical, alien twins and a pair of cloned androids.This story is elaborate, riddled with betrayal, treason and hidden agendas. Between the lines, I detected an inconspicuous romance.The author deals with strong emotions and asks the question: Who is a real human? The answer comes from the Androids' point of view.A. M. Duquette brings a new dimension to artificial intelligence.This story is spellbinding and will keep you turning the pages right till the send. I strongly suggest it."
3,better books out there,I was disappointed with the book. My daughters and I read it and all of thought it lacked something. I can't say we grew from anything written in the book. There's better books out there to help find peace within.
4,Patterns in a well written pamphlet,"This is a pamphlet, not a book. Also, the illustrations are in black and white, so the only color is the cover. Fortunately, the entire selection is represented as swatches on the back cover so you can get an idea how they look when done.The best part is the writing is very clear, and the instructions are easy to follow. I think the cost was a bit high for the product; I should have read the description more carefully. But it is something I can work from and that is what I wanted, so it will do."
3,Happy,Can't wait to start new project. Now just waiting for other order to come in that is the monks cloth.
3,learn to make monks cloth afghans,"these are more difficult to make than I thought. I tried several times, and then just put it up for another day and time"
4,Great Resource,"I saw the title of this book and picked it up - we are trying to build web services via SOAP at my company and we are not migrating to .NET for a while yet. The book proved worthy of it's title. This book covers modern implementations with legacy technology. Thank you to the authors. I suspect that there are quite a few companies out there that, like us, need to see VB6 references for a while yet (Microsoft has seemed to replace their VB6 documentation with VB.NET documentation on their site).I recommend this one!"
2,Not that good,"Not sure the one that is shipped is genuine, becuase the smell is good but it is not strong enough."
1,do not smells like Bvlgary to me,"I ve been purchasing this perfume for my wife like for 3 years now, all of them bought at Macys, this time i decided it to buy it online and for our surprise, do not smell like Bvlgary omnia to us, i guess its not the real deal, its what we feel."
1,horrible,"This perfume is very watered down. You can hardly smell it at all. I am very disappointed in this product! This is unacceptable, I expect when I order an item that I receive that item, not a watered down version of it!"
2,The smell does not last,"Im upset with this purchase, did not have any problems with shipping but the perfum is not good, i been using this perfum for long time never had any problem before but this time bougth it in a different place and the scent does not last for more than 10 min"
3,Pleasantly different,"I pretty much bought this on a whim. I had no prior idea what it smelled like. I gotta say not too bad for a random purchase. This scent is not a light girly scent. It smells more fitting for someone with a mature presence. I'm a young lassie so it's hard to incorporate this scent into my everyday, but I do wear it on days I feel like being more mysterious. I like this because it smells slightly unfamiliar and unexpected, but it has to be used judiciously or you may end up smelling old."
1,Love the scent - but the product was poor...,"The perfume is amazing - great scent that is said to be for evening but I wear it every day. Unfortunately, the product I received from Tuccini was weak and didn't last. Likely a fake considering the price. Two thumbs up for the product and I won't purchase from the seller Tuccini again."
1,Not Original Name Brand.,"Not What I Expected , I Thought It Was An Original Name Brand.!Should Specify That It's An Imitation Brand"
3,Not my Favorite Garlock Book,"I've read a lot of Dorothy Garlock's books, but this was not one of my favorites. Maybe it was the time period that didn't appeal to me, but it seemed it was a bit contrived. Everything fell into place too easily.It was a good read according to some of the other authors, just not one of Garlock's best."
4,Depression revisited,"I was too young to understand the Depression and its cause, but this book was a very good reenactment of how it might have been and how the poor put up with life. It was an innocent time too because most of the people helped each other even tho they had nothing themselves. The year is 1932. The story simple and interesting. The romance was sweet. Nothing hot, just a nice book with a real bad guy thrown in for everyone to hate. This was my first Dorothy Garlock read and I just might look for others."
4,Big and Thick...But Damn Good!,"I am Mary Tudor was an excellent book. I love English history, specifically that of the Tudor line, so I was very impressed when I read this book. There is good character description, a good plot, drama, emotion, you name it this book's got it."
1,Don't bother with this stuff,"This stuff doesn't hold. Use museum wax instead. I tried this stuff to secure my antique crystal glass items onto the smooth glass shelves of display cases. It just oozes out from under the item and makes a mess all over the shelf. If the item is near the edge of the shelf, it oozes out and drips down the cabinet. If your cabinet gets bumped the likelihood of the display glass falling is almost as great as if there were nothing to secure the glass at all. Don't waste your money. For opaque items, use museum putty."
1,Use at Your Own Risk!,"Amazon's ad states that this stuff ""works on most surfaces and glass"" and that it ""won't damage furniture."" However, here's what the manufacturer's instructions that come in the box with the product state:""We recommend the product for use on impenetrable objects and surfaces only. When we say 'impenetrable,' we mean a surface or object that is completely impervious to moisture or water. It must be completely waterproof. Objects considered completely waterproof are glass, crystal, porcelain, Formica, tile, polished granite, certain varnished wood, metal and many others. If you use the product on any other surface, you run the risk of staining which may not be removable.""On the next page there's this warning: ""Be sure to read all written material and use this product at your own risk.""Given the possible negative consequences of using this goop to hold down glass objects on my tables, shelves, and the fireplace mantel, it's going back to Amazon or into the trash."
1,Weird stuff,I thought this was the same material used by credit card companies to stick the card to a transmittal letter for mailing. I used it to attach a pocketcam to my dash and the next morning the pocketcam had fallen off and the gel had flowed down the dash. Weird! This stuff is like The Blob flowing and oozing all over. I would not depend on it to hold anything in an earthquake.
2,Didn't work for me.,"This didn't work for what I needed it for. When it got hot out it melted, very disappointed! I don't reccommend it."
3,"not great, but does the job",You have to be very careful and follow the instructions pretty much to the letter. If you use too much the product starts to spread and will not hold the item in place.It is just ok.Recommend the earthquake putty instead of this stuff.
5,RVers friend,"This is a great product for use in RVs. My husband and I travel in our motor home and this helps keep items in place while moving around. It makes less to pack and allows us to have some pictures, etc. To make it home."
3,quakehols gel,"I haven't used this product yet. The seller shipped it quickly and it was as predicted. I bought it to hold Christmas decorations (such as ribbons, greenery, etc.) in place around serving platters."
5,Pertronix 1181 Electronic ignition conversion module,"A great item to convert your GM product to electronic ignition. Works well and is easily installed. I know of many installations that have been in service for years, so the parts are reliable. Install a new high voltage ignition coil at the same time and gain some performance and extend the life of your sparkplugs."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"Great product: I installed this in my 63 chevy truck, had a HEI igntion at first but the unit was too big and was hitting the firewall and couldnt get the timing set properly. Only gave 20 bucks for the HEI at the junkyard including wires, so I watch YOUTUBE on this Ignitor from Pertronix to get reviews,ordered it, installed it and what a difference it made in my 350 engine, my only concern it that the gauge on the wire are a little undersize ,but its a great buy from AMAZON."
3,Last Seduction was shot full-frame!,"To the reviewer who wrote ""Buyer Beware,"" this film was shot for HBO -- in the full-frame format. Hence, no widescreen on the DVD. The way it looks on Artisan's DVD is the way it's supposed to look. Full-screen does NOT always mean pan-and-scan!"
2,Not pan & scan: Open matted,"... The film was initially shot in the academy ratio (full frame) as a tele-movie. When it's released in theatres it is matted. So the currently-available DVD should be showing the entire frame, not cropped.Still there's no excuse for Artisan's barebone tratement for the title. Not even a trailer is there! We waited so long for it to come out on DVD again and it must be one of the biggest disppointment of the year."
3,Just Disc Info,"This bit of info is only pertaining to the Disc released by Lionsgate on 2002-11-19.The disc is 1.33:1.The back of cover reads : ""this disc is formatted FROM its original version to fit your TV screen"". The original version 35 mm Spherical with Panavision lens - so it's in essence ""open matted"" for this DVD... that is to say, you are seeing MORE that the director intended (not less, so its not pan and scan).Video Quality is 2.5 / 5(Polygram Home Video version is `1.85:1 released in 1998, so i assume the quality would be more poor.)here is a link to the explanation of Academy Flat / Spherical Processing so its easy to understand why you are seeing either 'more than the director intended' with this disc, or at the very least, just want the director intended with this Full Screen presentation - dvdactive.com-editorial-articles-aspect-ratios-explained-part-one.[...]"
4,FemmeFatale to end them all....,"This movie could be harmful to your health if you are fascinated by bad women, there have been other femme-fatales,Davis, , Stanwyck,Turner, Stone, Theresa Russell, Barrymore, but Fiorentino defeats them all as ruthlessly as Kroy defeats her opponents in 'last seduction': it wasnt termed a filme-noir legend for nothing, Fiorentino is ably supported by Berg, Pullman and others, but no taking credit from her, they couldnt have done it without her....but for the HBO telemovie release,Fiorentino would have gotten Oscar or Golden globe and be a household-name top-rung star.....tantalisingly, some of Bridgets attitudes in certain areas are shared by Fiorentino, apparently...."
1,BEWARE!! Pan & Scan,"Nice job Artisan. You've done it again. Apparently Artisan has chosen to be the keeper of the flame for pan & scan. After ruining the DVD release of ""A Midnight Clear"" by giving it the same treatment, Artisan has decided that pan & scan was the best treatment for ""The Last Seduction"". Do these people hate cinematographers and directors?From now on I will always equate Artisan with inferior DVD releases."
2,Not Body Heat,"The Last Seduction, a descriptive title, aptly predicting the plot line of this ""thriller,"" weakens the prelude to a grifter-mission-impossible. Surly the producer might have conjured a jazzier title.Linda Florentino is pretty with clothes on or off, one of those tall slim Hollywood gals with augmented lips. She talks tough and dirty, outdoing her men toys in the saddle, so if the viewer wants some steamy stuff, okay, ya got it. The problem: the plot is unbelievable. A good thriller, take Body Heat for example, gives you the steamy romance and a plot device that doesn't intrude. If the mechanics of the swindle are forced, well, we have only Florentino's next hot scene to look forward too.Weirdly, Bill Pullman, the smarmy medical student turned pill pusher, Fiorentino's hubby, shines up the plot, keeping it ""real"" when he is on the screen, which is not often. A little humor goes a long way in a tragedy. Just ask William Shakespeare."
1,Not Impressed,"Linda Fiorentino's portrayal of a cold, calculating sexual predator was lackluster, and unconvincing at best....as was the plot. Peter Berg carried off his role and was the only reason I continued to watch. Though mentioned on an episode of Sex & the City, for a hot sex scene, I found it dull. This movie was a disappointment."
3,So-so movie tough to take,"This was an ok movie but I had problems with it. First, it is too long and can't sustain the plot or interest for 110 minutes. Second, many of the plot twists were telegraphed. Third, there were holes in the logic of the set up. Finally, the main character, although sexy, was just too evil and unsympathetic."
5,Injustice!,"I can only echo the sentiments of other reviewers here. This is absolutely, hands down one of my all-time favourite films. It's bad enough that Linda Fiorentino didn't get an Oscar for her performance in this stylish, black comedy... film noir, but now we cannot even buy it! For the unititiated, it's plot concerns an unrepentingly manipulative, dupliciticious, backstabbing, double-crossing, oversexed, cold, sarcastic, bullying and wickedly intelligent woman, whom we can only love and admire as we watch her stoop to increasingly amoral steps to outsmart her almost-equal-to-the-par conman/doctor hubbie, all the while dragging a hopelessley struck (as in love and dumb) young, small town hick along for the ride. Not for those with soft ears or hearts, I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS FILM IS NOT AVAILABLE ON VHS OR DVD! Please, sate our hunger and let us feed on this awesome paen to the [extremely] bad girl as hero!"
3,Now Available on DVD!,"A nice dark little movie, where the good guys don't win and the guilty go unpunished. It is pretty unusual to have such a strong female character, it was entertaining to see a woman as tough as nails and unflinching. The male characters were considerably less developed. You are bludgeoned with the ""men will do anything for sex"" message - so what if that cliché happens to be true. The slight parallels to Double Indemnity are fun, but Linda Fiorentino would mop up the floor with Barbara Stanwyck. This is a stripped down, bare bones DVD. The sound is simple stereo, not that is matters because this is not an action flick."
3,Injustice to Great Film! Not Widescreen/ Poor Print Quality,"This is a fantastic modern film noir...I won't repeat the praise other reviewer's have already given it. I am disappointed the DVD was released in Full Screen only, and the print quality leaves something to be desired. It's a 5 star film on a 3 star DVD. Lets hope it gets re-released in a format more befitting a great film."
4,"sharp, vicious femme fatale flick","This movie is NOT for the faint of heart. The anti-heroine (Fiorentino) is cold, ruthless, and entirely consistent. This movie fixed one of my greatest beefs with most villians - DON'T MAKE STUPID MISTAKES!This is one sharp woman, and woe to the men who get in her way."
1,Wonderful movie and an advertising lie,"Wonderful movie and an advertising lie. I hate, hate and HATE it that I was told about format it was closed-captioned, and then I got the DVD disc with no English subtitles. It significantly reduces a value of the cultural artefact. End of review! Damn it.Zoran, Amsterdam"
4,Why the LAST Seduction?,This broad is a pro with no moral sense. A manipulator with no heart or conscience. Except for the murder aspect I'd say I see her in action in my social settings every day. Good movie about a particular type of woman.
3,Linda looks better in green.,"I've been waiting a long time to see this movie, and I just finished watching it five minutes ago. Frankly, it's not what I'd had it built up to be, which was a bit disappointing. However, examining the movie as is, it's good. But if you're looking to see a thriller with Linda Fiorentino all sexy and suspect of murders, JADE blows this movie out of the water. I was ready for a story about a murderous BLACK WIDOW femme fatale and she definitely wasn't it. Don't get me wrong, she's great. The plot just wasn't what I thought. At times it was more funny and slapstick than dark and intriguing."
4,Great,"My husband is a huge Who fan and this is one of his favorite albums..Oops, I mean cd's! Showing my age.."
5,Headphones,"First time I heard this was over FM radio wearing headphones lying in bed, listening. They played the whole thing and they had short interval of somthing weird and then played the next cut, did this for the whole album, it was 1970 somthing.IF you havent listened to this whole thing with real headphones without distraction, do it, trust me, do it, I would not lie.Good lesson for guitar players also."
3,"Good, not great.","This is a good, extended version of a classic record. It doesn't hold up as well over time as the old vinyl, but whatever. The extra tracks are nice, but now I realize why they weren't included in the first place."
2,if u didn't know any better,"If u have never ever heard the original Live at Leeds ,a six song sonic blast of power unlike anything you'd ever of heard before. I guess i am tainted by the original record I had. In the era of revisionist history and completest then this is fine, I just know if i heard the first track heaven and hell instead of the blistering young man blues,i would of passed on this .So if you don't know any better then buy this one ,if your looking for that great blast of power from the past then ,well its hear but its all messed up . So buy it like I did and put the original 6 on the i-pod and the other tunes in the shuffle play list. and if your wondering what the original 6 was, don't buy the bull of this expanded track really improve on the original ,that's crap.1. Young Man Blues"" - 5:512. ""Substitute"" - 2:053. ""Summertime Blues"" - 3:224. ""Shakin' All Over"" - 4:155. ""My Generation"" - 14:276. ""Magic Bus"" - 7:30"
3,average,"My reasoning behind giving the almighty Live at Leeds an average rating has to mainly do with my dislike of the song choices. If you like the songs that are featured here, most likely you will be satisfied with this live Who experience.For me though, many of these songs are good in their studio versions, but not really the kind of songs I ever feel like hearing in a live setting. I think that's my main problem with the album.Oh sure, some of these songs are improved, and even stretched out quite a bit, but for the most part, I'm happy enough with the studio versions. The remastered version DOES sound a lot better though, so that's a good thing. It's still not THAT great of a sound though. I've heard better (even from the Who themselves)."
2,not the original,"My dad has the original vinyl album of this and it is nothing like it at all. First off there is an extra 8 songs added to the ""remastered' cd. I would not reccomend it.here are the six songs:1. Young Man Blues 4:452. Substitute 2:053. Summertime Blues 3:224. Shakin' All Over 4;155. My Generation 14:276. Magic Bus 7:30"
5,ne plus ultra,"...which is Latin for ""it doesn't get any better than this."" Hands down the best live rock album ever recorded. There are others that come close -- Hendrix's Band of Gypsies, the Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East, the Stones' Get Yer Ya-Yas Out, a handful of others that capture a time & space -- but this one gets my vote. Pure unfiltered rock bliss. ""Young Man Blues"" by itself grabs you by the collar (or whatever) and won't let go. Go ahead and invest in the double-CD reissue that has the full-length performance of Tommy if you want to, but you will probably play the first disc more often. Play it loud, it'll do you no harm."
5,the birth of heavy metal,"if you want to hear where led zepplin stole their sound, then listen to Live At Leeds. If you want to hear the GREATEST ROCK DRUMMER EVER then listen to Live At Leeds. If you want to be witness to the birth of heavy metal then listen to Live At Leeds.Everything else is just a pale copy of this masterpiece."
3,Who Live at Leeds,"I used to think the remastered version of Live at Leeds was an improvement over the original LP, which was a classic in itself. That was, until I found a copy of the bootleg ""Live At Leeds Complete."" The problem with the remastered ""Live At Leeds"" after hearing the boot is obvious: the original tapes were tinkered with. Entwhistle overdubed new vocals and bass parts, as did Daltry and possibly Townsend. The boot features the entire show, which includes ALL of ""Tommy."" As a double disc, it's over two hours of primal, undubbed, unedited Who (""Shakin' All Over"" contains an entire part where they go into ""Spoonful"" that is edited out of the remaster!Alan Wright"
5,Amazing!,"i am (was) not a Who fan, but it's pretty much common knowledge that The Who were a great live band and i saw the great price of this CD and decided to buy it. i was not disappointed. no, in fact, i just love this album! simply amazing recording, flowing from track to track (except towards the end), with truly valuable liner notes. the songs are great, but the true magic is in the energy with which they are performed. the digitally remastered sound is beautiful. you don't have to be a Who fan to get this live album, it's a piece of 60s history (yes, i know it was recorded in early 1970)."
2,Nice extra tracks; inferior sound quality.,"I just received my copy of the 'Deluxe Edition' of the classic album The Who Live At Leeds in the mail today. On hearing just the first few notes it was clear that this version doesn't sound as good as the 1995 release. I bought it for the extra tracks but I have to say i'm very disappointed in it sonically (the 'blanket' effect over the instruments & vocals from the Dolby Noise Reduction is immediately obvious) and I agree with the other reviewers who complained on that point. This version doesn't have nearly the 'ass kick' soundwise of the preceding 1995 release. I'll be looking for a copy as well of the 'Live At Leeds Complete' CD and listening to my 'old' 1995 version instead of this one. Maybe Pete will take the cue from some of these reviews and 'do it up right', both in terms of the completeness of the show and the sonic issues."
5,"If everyone owned this, there would be world peace","It's real simple:1. Play this as loud as you can2. Close your eyes and imagine yourself at the show3. Sometimes just focus on the drums, sometimes on the bass4. Sometimes take it all in and realize just how REAL and RAW this recording is.5. Everyone should own this.Again, play it as loud as you can handle."
2,Get The 1995 Version,"The Tommy set is just not mastered well, and they over did the first disc, the 1995 version sounds great, and unless you have to hear the tommy set, don't bother with this."
5,Truly a Desert Island Disc,"Catching a great band at the top of their game, Live At Leeds is unsurpassed in the annals of concert recordings - the gold standard by which others should be measured. On an average night The Who would reach musical (and decibel) levels other bands could only dream of. On a particulary inspired occasion like this one they were untouchable (Pete later remarked ""I can only remember concentrating very hard""). With a distinctly percussive yet melodic sound all their own, they blaze a trail here that will leave the listener wowed by the sonic energy coming from those famous Hi Watt amps.Buy this CD, enjoy it, and marvel at how essentially 3 soloists and Rock's best singer could meld together to produce some of the best rock 'n roll ever."
5,The Who showing true form,"For anyone who does not regard THE WHO as one of the greatest rock bands ever to play; listening to this album may very well change your mind. This is by far the hardest The Who have ever rocked. Each of the band members jam strongly on their instruments, Entwistle plays loud and beautifully, Daltrey howls out the vocals delivered right on time. This album stands up very nicely to Led Zep 2, and Let it Bleed.Almost all of Tommy, a lot of stuff from A QUICK ONE, and a big bundle of their singles can be found on this record being played to their fullest potential.My personal recommendation: The Who has a distinct voice that is their own. But if you like the Stones, Beatles, Hendrix, or Zeppelin, this is an album that should be in your collection. Favorite cuts: Tattoo, Substitute, Happy Jack, A Quick One, Overture, It's a Boy, Amazing Journey, Acid Queen, and Pinball wizard. Buy either this or Quadrophenia first, they are the best two WHO albums."
5,"""Live at Leeds"" Bleeds Rock","I had not heard Live at Leeds since I was a kid, but I knew it was a good CD. But I didn`t know (at least as my present self) how great of a CD Live at Leeds is, and therfore how great of a band The Who were. They were truly incredible! I guess sometimes memory fails the issue when it comes to art, music, and sensations. I`m sure glad I bought this CD. You might be too."
1,Somebody's gettin rich(er) !,"Gosh, when will the NEXT reissue of this album be out? Why they couldn't just put it all out at once is beyond me. I'm not made of money, Petey!"
1,Wrong one,"I ordered the wrong cd, I needed the double disc. Was able to return it no problems and reorder the correct one."
4,Ancient Treasure,"It had been years since I owned this on vinyl and, as it was on sale, I took a chance. Figured the worst that might come of it is I give it to my old bandmate, Ken, in FL. Well, he's gonnahaftawait.... Having this recording took me back to the night they released Tommy and I was watching the band at the Fillmore East. Here's the Who in their prime and loving every minute of their performance. I don't think that I can say that again until their 9/11 Memorial show. Definitely a ""keeper"""
5,My favorite Who album,"That is what i call a rock show! I just can't stop listening to it, especially the Tommy portion. A must have for any Who lover."
5,Mini-vinyl reproduction Live at Leeds,"The greatest live album of all time has been re-released in shrunken down form with all the original inserts, the remastered music and new booklet - there's even a Japanese booklet with interesting lyrics as well. Apart from the MCA full size vinyl CD replica, this is as close as you'll get to the original package.The music contained is The Who at their absolute peak. Keith Moon plays and sounds much better than on Live at the Isle of Wight. Don't miss this limited edition."
5,A GREAT LIVE ALBUM,If you ever wondered what the allure of the Who was; this cd will explain all. It has the original lineup and they all sound great. The best version of Magic Bus is performed brilliantly. This is a must have for any WHO fan.
5,Who's Best,"This may be the greatest live album ever made. At this point in their career, The Who put on one of the best shows in the business. For todays young listeners or those not familiar with the band's history, you will recognize the incredible influence these guys have had on Rock from Punk to Grunge to Garage. The C.D. also makes a convincing case that Keith Moon was the greatest drummer ever, and John Entwistle the premiere bassist. For diehard fans, this is simply a must have. If you've only heard the abbreviated version of this album, get the deluxe edition. The former is like judging a movie after viewing the trailer."
5,"The Who,","Let me sart off saying that this is probaly the best live album you can pick up by The Who. First off this is the Who at there finest and best. Everyone is really enthusiastic about peforming. The songs they play on here are great( subsitute, my generation, i cant explain and MANY MORE. Plus the quailty of the recording is amazing, if you turn it up full blast and close your eyes and you can imagine the Who playing live in 1970. Summertime Blues was a cool song on here also... Now though with a version with the whole concert, though if you dont want to spend[...]dollars than i would recomend this CD on amazon. First of its only $[...] so its a great deal. Buy it today, great for any Who fan, buy it today."
5,A MUST-HAVE,"It's The Who. Live. At Leeds University. Duh. How come you haven't bought it already? Powerful live set from seminal rock four-piece, blah, blah, sizzling energy, innovative songwriting, blah blah....Keith Moon....buy it. Listen to it. Have mind blown."
2,NOT A COMEDY,"SPOILER Review: I'm not quite sure why this movie is listed as a comedy, it is in no way shape or form funny. It is a thriller/horror and as one other reviewer stated more like Fatal Attraction, however without the satisfing ending. The movie is well acted and I was ""in"" the movie, so much so that I absolutely hated Angelique. I cannot stand any woman that dates a married man, then whines when he won't spend time with her, and always tells friends that he will leave his wife any minute. And then when you realize that she's just a nutter, I hatted her because she practically ruined that man's life, killing his baby, ruining his career, and leaving him disabled. I think if you can overlook those huge character flaws, then you might enjoy the movie."
3,"Looks a lot like the old ""Fatal Attraction""""","A woman who make believe in a life and a love that does not exist, pesters a doctor, try to destroy his life, his wife,his career, his unborn child, a totally psychotic woman. Just help me open my eyes to the number of crazy peoples that may be around the corner and usually they look nice and normal, but you never know what go in their heads..."
5,Great Foreign Film With A Twist,"This little gem of a movie is unexpectedly wonderful. It seems like a beautiful French love story at first and twists into something quite different.....But I won't give it all away.Audrey Tautou is perfect as the young student who falls in love with an attractive Doctor. Her innocence sucks you in and she is absolutely believable as a youthful exuberant woman in love. But beauty is what it is and sometimes it is what it isn't, be prepared to be taken on a surprising ride. Sometimes love takes on new meaning, especially for the young and easily influenced.This film is artfully directed with beautiful colors surrounding the scenes. It is all things French.....and highly recommended!"
4,Not at all what I expected---which is great!,"Audrey Tatou is Angelique, a French art student who is madly in love with Loic, a cardiologist. He is married to a lawyer, and they are about to have their first baby. All she thinks about is Loic. At the beginning he seemed so attentive. As time wears on, he seems to stand her up a lot more. Is he going to leave his wife for her, or is he promising something that will never happen? I can't say any more, because that would spoil the whole thing! See it for yourself!This movie is told in two parts--first from her side, and then, from his. Nothing is the way it seems in this little thriller. One thing for certain: Audrey Tatou can not only play the sweet, innocent little one from Amelie. She has depth as an actress."
4,"If you have insomnia, do not see the film late hours","The peformance of the leading actors is excellent and very dramatic. Several times I felt as need to scream ""Call to police, she is stacking you..."" for no avail........ But this is the true situation I guess when people do not see and not aware what they are doing until too late..... Impulses are everywhere and you feel sorry for the character involved. If you want ot learn how to be observant in life and watch out for the ramifications .. please see this movie. Also it is very well shot and the actors perform beautifully . Recomended for the very sensetive but well paranoid minds......."
5,"Charming, Alarming","This is one of my favorite movies.It is endlessly seductive and surprising.Essentially, it is two movies, from two polar points of view: the female's and the male's.It takes a winsome romantic love-story, and turns it on its head.But even though the plot is fraught with delusion and confusion, the love-story remains charming and alluring, if also terrifying.The acting is superb. Casting Audrey Tautou as the female lead was inspired. She is so girlish and open-eyed that her transformation is all the more shocking.The sunny photography is also brilliant. The movie seems set in a perpetual brilliant summer, even at the end when the lead gets away, leaving her pill-art to be scraped off the wall.Fun and frightening."
5,Love this movie!,"I am a retired French teacher. I used to use this film in my classroom and the students loved it. Every year I showed it, they would beg me to watch it again because they wanted to see how the plot could really have evolved the way it did. I lost my copy so I had to have a new one to share with my movie club friends."
3,Another good French movie,"I saw this movie in the theater here in the US. The movie is over all worht seeing, it's full of nice twists and innovative approch to direction and movie writing. The story it self is not novel, it's just a regular man-woman relationship. However, the approach the director uses is pretty original and captivating. When watching this movie you have to be patient, cause you might think it's just another love story between a pervert man and his submissive mistress, however, if you are patient enough you would be pleasantly surprised. I have to mention also that despite the nice, innovative directorship approach, there were many flaws with the story line and some times it didn't even make sense.Finally, I have to give two thumbs up to the sound track, I personally thought it was awsome."
4,"Not for everyone,","But, if you like twists/turns you'll enjoy this. I think this should be seen two or three times to really ""get"" it. Of course, Audrey Tatou is as charming as ever, she really has a lot of range as an actress and she's adorable,too. The plot/story is told by all the participants through their own eyes and it would depend on which version you believe. I thought it was different and entertaining a bit confusing, maybe, but that's why it needs repeat viewing. This has French subtitles, which didn't bother me, but some may not like that."
5,The rare '10' movie!,Well done. Many twist and turns will keep you on edge of your seat until the fantastic ending. Creepy. Well done!
4,And then what happened....,"Watching the first 20 minutes of this film I was mystified as to why my friend had recommended it so highly. It was a nice movie but the plot was as old as the hills and then....Sorry, can't say more without giving it all away. See the movie before someone tells you too much! Lots of fun -"
1,Seller sent a cracked DVD,"I love movies and will randomly fill up an amazon.com shopping cart with DVDs that are hard to find. I have never opened up dvds right away to make sure there are no scratches/problems. When I finally got around to watching He loves me, He loves me not (which was after the return window), I found out the DVD was cracked. Lesson learned, I guess you have to inspect dvds when they arrive. Even though they come in secured sealed cases."
1,"He loves me, he loves me not",Well we could not view the film as you sent us a film for US format and not a european. Thanks very much money wasted!!!!!!Its very unprofessional of you as a company!!!!
5,... but what about all our plans?,I saw this movie shortly after seeing Amelie and I was convinced that poor Audrey Tatou was being led on and manipulated. Our sweet little optimistic Audrey could never do anything so disturbing.Could she?
5,Amazing,"This movie is amazing, we watched it in my French class and I just recently purchased it. It is one of my favorites."
4,Watch out for the quiet ones!,"Audrey Tautou was perfectly cast for this role. She has this innocent, angelic, waifish air about her. You would never expect a frail creature like her attempt murder. The first half of the movie is very convincing. You have no trouble believing that this naive young girl fell in love with a doctor. The enormous dark eyes... The red rose... And then the illusion falls apart! The movie would not have been as effective with a more ""vampy"" female lead. When the woman comes across and sexually aggressive, you expect the worst from her. You already perceive her as a cold-blooded seductress. By picking A. Tautou as the lead, the director totally beguiled the audience."
4,A fascinating train wreck,"What an imaginative movie! This renews my hope in the creative possibilities of cinematic media, where such lamebrained attempts like any Jennifer Lopez movie have reigned. Although it may suffer from the fact that it can't be seen more than once a year, this is definitely something to see. Audrey Tautou is refreshingly different from her breakthrough role in Amelie as the intense but vulnerable Angelique, a promising artist in love with a doctor who refuses to leave his pregnant wife.Angelique, in turn, remains doggedly faithful to Loic despite the advances of a lovesick friend and the exasperation of her co-worker. The strain begins to wear her down, however, until she realizes that something must be done.A clever twist to our assumptions about romance. Well-crafted."
3,Fair Book!,It was an ok book. Not really that good. Had to force myself to finish it since I paid for it!. Outcome was very predicitable and glossed over.
2,Flat story,this is not nearly as good as some of her other stories. It is more of a far-fetched romance novel than a mystery.
5,Awesome,"This is one of the most useful books I have ever bought. I had three particular problems in mind, and I wasn't buying this book specifically for them; it was more for reference. But I opened it up and it had clear, concise, and easy instructions for doing what I needed- much better than the information I had gotten through hours of internet searches into the problems.This is a must own for any PC owner, ESPECIALLY if you have Windows."
2,big changes in computers,This book has much good (and I think correct) information on computers no longer for sale. Of antiquarian and nostalgia interest.
3,"Good material, good narration, below-average writing.","This is good material. The narrator's voice is great.It is not worth the price.For the price you would expect this to be proofread.Simple grammar mistakes such as,""different than,"" instead of ""different from,""""comprised of"" instead of ""comprising,""a ""good omen,"" (which is an oxymoron),and even ""looked badly,"" and ""felt badly,"" which makes my ears bleed."
3,pretty but not so comfy,"The ankle on these boots does not give, so be prepared to walk stiffly for quite a while."
4,Disclosure,"Whether in a business suil or a bikini Ms. Moore looks good! A very good story, fast moving and exciting."
4,entertaining movie,"First, I like both Michael Douglas and Demi Moore. The movie is very entertaining and has a ""gotcha"" scene at the end. I really liked it!"
4,Can a movie ever be as good as the book its based on?,"Michael Crichton's 'Disclosure' tried to give us another angle on the sexual harrasement issue: now that women can reach high management positions, can they also harras the men working under them, or is sexual harrasement still only occurs to women by men?Movies, by nature, are more about visuals & flow, while books are about details. In this instance, the lack of details did help the movie in one instance: the lack of high tech jargon may have made it more accessible to people who aren't interested in it. On the other hand, if people were asked what the most memorable scene in the movie was - it would probably be the sex scene in Meredith Johnson's office, not any more vital, lesson teaching scene.The cast was very well type cast."
5,Sexual Harassment Turned Upside Down,"This is a reversal of the typical case in most workplaces. I remember most people in the movie theater were yelling for Sanders (Michael Douglas) to proceed to have sex with Meridith (Demi Moore). There was a big disappointment when he did not. Some statements were funny, particulary those of his wife. It was also amusing how he turned the tables on Meridith at the shareholders meeting. The movie shows that he did the right thing, because he avoided the awkward situation of his boss becoming the mother of his child."
3,Somewhat stiff and stilted,"The concept behind this movie is intriguing - a sexual harassment suit in which the guy is the victim. Michael Douglas is great. However, Demi Moore can't act at all. Much of the script sounds like a bad political speech rather than actual dialogue. The music would work for an international spy thriller, but sounds out of place here. I'd like to see this concept, with Michael Douglas, but redone a bit better."
3,Not as good as the book,"Disclosure is a typical movie that is based on a book. I don't know how many times I have said to myself ""well it was okay, but the book was better."" Well that is exactly what I said about Disclosure. In the book Michael Crichton did a good job of making you feel sympathy for Tom Sanders and hatred for Meredith Johnson but the movie doesn't. I just feel that Tom is foolish and gets what he deserves. Also the way they do the harassment scene in the movie is horrible. It looks to me that Tom is enjoying himself too much and not resisting very much. The virtual reality parts are not as interesting and thought provoking as in the book. They seem to be a last minute thing that they had to add in or else. The acting was good and that's why it gets 3 stars. But overall the directing and the book to screen transformation is weak but if you want mild suspense, and mild is almost and overstatement, then watch Disclosure. But don't expect Oscar worthy material. 3 Stars"
5,Great Service,"THIS ITEM ARRIVED IN THE CONDITION PROMISED, AND BEFORE EXPECTED DATE.WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER."
2,.,"This film will only be ""controversial"" and ""thought-provoking"" to the bland, white, middle-class working drones it is catered to. This is basically just your typical ""adult-oriented"" Hollywood fluff. It could've been worse, but it's only very marginally entertaining (the ""virtual reality"" stuff is just plain silly), and it's certainly a far cry from profound."
4,A good movie adaption to a Great book,"I was very happy with this movie. I always watch the film version of a book after I have read it, and this is one of the few I really enjoyed. Of course, like most movies that started as books, there are a few differences, but nothing big enough for me to complain about.Douglas and Moore do a great job in this movie and make it very believable. This is based on a true story after all. The parts were picked out perfectly also. Even though I didnt picture Michael Douglas as Tom Sanders when I read the book, he does a great job of becoming this character.Overall, this movie is a great thriller with good acting. I would think that 3 out of 4 people will walk away from this movie with a smile."
2,Dis-Clothes-Her,"A movie that tries to foil anything politically correct can't be all bad, and director Barry Levinson's Disclosure sets up a number of intriguing situations along its sexual harrassment superhighway. Problem is, what starts out as having potential sinks quickly into the mire of writer Michael Crichton's shallow characters and insipid plotting. Despite some snappy dialogue and a wealth of opportunities to tongue-lash the villainess (Moore), Disclosure lacks the tension that this kind of high-tech jousting requires: the virtual reality scene near the end of the film seems particularly tacked on. Somehow I feel hesitant recommending a film that is supposed to be dealing honestly with the complexities of male-female relationships in the workplace, but that ultimately reinforces the stereotypes it claims to be shattering."
3,The message conveyed is better than the film itself,"DISCLOSURE is one of those films where the messages ring loud and clear, but the overall film falls just slightly flat.The themes of power trumping all,corporate greed and the reverse roles of sexual harassment are extremely potent and well conveyed.The films leaves you with much to consider when it comes to rushing to judgments.The story, though, gets a little off base at times with the Virtual Reality bit that seems to distract from the driving energy of this movie.Definitely not the slickest Barry Levinson film I have seen.I was actually a little let down.All-in-all adefinite one time viewing.This film could have been so much better than it ended up. The ending was rather tacked on after some good suspense."
5,Awesome praise music feauring a men's choir.,"This is really an awesome CD of praise music from a men's choir. It really rocks!! The songs are great. I highly recommend this CD!!The playlist follows: Songs are these: Let All the World Sing Praises, Holy Is the Lord, Hallelujah Hosanna/Halala, Every Time That We Are Gathered, With My Whole Heart, One Voice, If the Lord Had Not Been On Our Side, Strengthen My Hands, Sacrifice Of Praise/We Are Free, Yes, We All Agree."
2,Short Battery Life,The battery lost power after only a few weeks of powering a weather station whose original battery lasted 6 months.
2,Ultralast UL-123/1 3V CR123 Photo Lithium Battery,"I bought these for my Inova X5MT-WB X5 flashlight but there was a sticker placed on the front of the packages received that reads ""Not for Use in Flashlights."" This sticker was not shown on Amazon's product page.THEN AMAZON ADVISED THAT THE BATTERIES CAN NOT BE RETURNED BECAUSE THEY ARE A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL!!!!!!ALSO NOT STATED IN AMAZON'S PRODUCT PAGE.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
1,Take a pass on this book,Not worth the time and money- this was quit disappointing .Save your money to buy something else more worth while.
4,Anti-Coloring Book,I work with kids in K-6 and I bought this for them. The book is very cool and it has been fun seeing what the kids do with the different pages!
5,"Fun, creative, absorbing - what more could you want?","I grew up with these books, and am thrilled they are still in print. The Anti-Coloring books are a wonderful alternative to mindlessly coloring between the lines. And at 9 years old, my oldest is not even close to outgrowing this series. Highly recommended!!!"
3,Good but check the age range and content carefully,"I ordered two of these for six year olds but ended up putting them aside for older children. I'd say eight or ten would be the youngest. Also, I was surprised that one page asks the children to draw what they think God looks like. I'm not totally comfortable giving that as a gift. I believe there was also a question about a crime and another about someone they hated. I hope most six year olds don't hate anyone yet. I'm not sure I even want them thinking about it. Anyway, just keep this in mind before you buy. The concept is great, but not sure about the product."
5,Love for prompting imagination,"I remember loving this coloring book as a kid, and was surprised to find so many variations! This is a great coloring book for prompting imagination and drawing instead of just coloring in the lines. (Which has it's place, I enjoyed that too) I remember loving the big empty space I could just invent stuffWhat I remember the most was that my Dad photocopied the pages and kept them in a drawer so that I could draw on my favorite pages over and over and over and over... It was the best idea ever! The book stayed clean and I could pick my favorites as many times as I wanted, and never worry about my brother ""stealing"" my page or anything.If you like this idea, you might also try the ""Oodles of Doodles"" book - the pictures are more simplistic (like they were drawn with a crayon) but it's the same principle. :)"
5,For pop-up book collectors,"This review focuses on the pop-ups in the book. This is an oversize book (12"" x 9.7"" x 0.4"") with 5 wonderful pop-ups (elephant, gorilla, lion, hyena & crodile). I have many pop-up books in my collection, but I don't remember seeing other pop-ups like the ones in this book; the pop-ups in this book are more realistic or ""lifelike"" than other pop-up books (the eyes and the body move as you open the book). The story is fairly simple and short, with a little bit of a surprise ending. Most young children would love this book.If you examine the paper engineering, it looks fairly simple, but considering how good the pop-ups are, I would say that the paper engineering is very clever. Another big advantage of this paper engineering is that the book can easily be opened and closed without an risk of creasing, tearing or damaging the pop-ups, so it is an excellent pop-up book for children to look at on their own."
1,Kaki should stick to her roots,"For those of you who love Kaki's acoustic guitar from her first CDs will not find much to like here. Perhaps you will literally see red. The eclectic and original melodies of her first CDs are missing here. This one is way over produced with too much garbage drowning out the one thing I loved Kaki for - the amazing guitar playin. Kaki, please stop singing. Just play your guitar and keep the experimentation out of the public's eye. Tracks 9-13 are about the only good tracks on this CD. The singing is childish and annoying. This is such a dramatic change from anything Kaki has done before. I hope she doesn't do it again."
1,garbage,"Awful guitar playing. Awful singing. Ridiculous lyrics.A melody would be nice. I remember one time I saw Kenny G, and Michael Bolton was the opening act. It was the single worst musical experience of my life - until I heard this record.If Kaki King is the most important new musical visionary to emerge in 30 years, then surely it's a sign of impending Apocalypse. The truth of the matter is that Kaki King's relative importance in guitar music is equivalent to being the best jazz piano player in the National Hockey League.If you're seriously interested in hearing the cutting edge of solo guitar music, listen instead to the brilliant Erik Mongrain. Kaki King is to guitar music what Richard Marx was to rock and roll.Avoid this CD at all cost."
5,Different but I love it,"No doubt this album will cause a lot of disturbance among Kaki King fans. It IS NOT her two previous albums. But it is a great album taken on its own merit. It is low key and IME great for late-night moods. I won't argue that Kaki King is a great singer, but her tone suits the songs. The album is a bit experimental in feel, but for me anyway it's good to see Kaki venture off to explore her own territory. It's 80's sounding, jazzy, moody, laid back, intense, a moment of Stevie Ray Vaughn. This to me is what is missing from so much of today's music - the edge, the risk taking, the music for music's sake. Whereas before Kaki was primarily a technical prodigy, now she has become a true musician and I look to watching/hearing where Kaki goes in the future. My guess she has the technical side down and now she wants to explore the music. And does not want to be pinned against the wall.Kudos to this determined, brave girl! Stick to it and do it your own way."
2,Awful!,"This book is just flat out bad. The ""techniques"" given are nothing more than executing a couple features in the program (i.e. things you would discover on your own after playing around for say...5 minutes).It is almost robbery to have a $40 list price on this book. There are reference books out there going for half the price as this, and they're MUCH more thorough.Do yourself a favor and buy ANY other Illustrator book besides this one."
5,4 Thumbs up,"It's great, my son LOVES it, very well made and worth every dollar. It is indeed a Master Replica!!!"
2,Not as good with storage problems,"Bought mine from GoHastings through Amazon website. When arrived the box was all torn up and taped. Inside, there was a piece missing that holds the lightsaber to the storage holder. If this happens to you, easy fix, just cut a piece of the cardboard box, take the transparent plastic holder piece and draw a template on the cardboard. Then cut it out and it should fit into the other slot holder that is missing. This is assuming that we're supposed to get 2 of those plastice holders. If not, then shame on Master Replicas.The lightsaber had many scratch marks on the blade. Looks like it went through a few battles. Beware when they sell ""New"". It isn't New."
3,Pretty But The Blade Is VERY Dull,"I was impressed by this item's sound effects and how bright it was. However I purchased it in order to do numerous mundane household tasks, cutting wood, fending off wolverines, etc. After about two hours of hacking at a pine tree, it stopped functioning all together and the tree was no worse for the wear. Very disappointed."
1,This translation is terrible,"This is not a review of Boccaccio, just this translation that originated in 1886. The 19th century English literature is fantastic. There is no reason that a translation of the bawdy Boccaccio should not reflect the wit of Austin, the 3 dimensions of Dickens or the wonder of Melville and so many others.I am sorry to say that this translation, unless you like the faux archaic touch such as, ""Thou doth protest, prithily, my lady,"" just plainly sucks. To call it prim and proper is not enough, it is downright prissy.Of course, the price on Kindle is wonderful but it is not a bargain.If you can suggest another Kindle translation, please reply."
5,A realistic masterpiece!,"The ""Decameron"" is a collection of 100 short stories written by the Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio between 1350 and 1353.It's about a a group of seven young women and three young men who flee Florence during the plague and end up living together in a villa in Fiesole for two weeks. To pass the time, each person tells a story to the others in the group. In this manner 100 stories are told which revolve around different amorous episodes, the lust and greed of the clergy and the adventures of a few merchants. The author elevates different moral values like the power of intelligence, quick wit, ethics and good manners and takes up different social behaviors like the tricks that women play on men or that people play one each other.The book is realistic, historical, philosophical, satirical and human."
5,Beautiful,The Book of Man -- A story of a mans love for a friend -- for his lover and mother of child -- and for his son. I read the book in one sitting. Barry goes back and forth in memories -- so ya gotta be quick. Couldn't put the book down. ....amazing!
2,Leadership,Selected this based on title alone for my Officer Candidates to read and review. It was not at all what I expected and was universally panned by the Candidates.
1,How Many People?,Just how many people can make money by teaching other people how to make money? She has nothing new and certainly no product considerations. Save your money.
2,Too Basic,"If you're just starting your journey as an infopreneur, than this book is a good starting point. If you've already spent some time researching this industry and/or already have your own publishing business, you already know most of this.I was very excited to read the book, based on other reviews, but it didn't take me long to realize that I wasn't going to learn anything new. The information is so basic, the author never really gets into any detail about anything. The book can't get you past deciding what type of infopreneur you want to be, because each chapter is so short on concrete how-tos.What I did like about the book were the interviews with successful inforpreneurs, but I was hoping they were longer. The few tips I picked up were from those interviews, which means they were from other people the author interviewed. Still, if you know nothing about this and are just trying to get an idea of how to go about it, you would probably find the book useful."
4,Great reference book to start with,"I found this book to be a great reference tool for getting me accustomed to the language and media available for online marketing. If I can learn at least two valuable pieces of information from a publication that I didn't know prior to reading it, it makes it worth the price.Recommendation: if an Amazon book listing has a ""see inside"" option, take a peek at the Table of Contents. It's a good indicator of whether you can expect general informaton on a topic, or in-depth. Clearly, if the ""how to sell a book on Amazon"" section is 2 pages long, you can expect generalized content. If you want an in-depth read on that subject, find one written specifically about selling a book on Amazon.Again, several pieces of information in this read were valuable to ME. I'm sure other newbies to the genre will feel the same way.Gail StrumbergerAuthor, ""Shock Therapy: Planaphobic"""
2,Good If You Are Looking to Find Out About Book Publishers,"I did not find this book very useful. I felt that she covered very basic information. Usually when I read these types of books I also enjoy the Case Studies / Testimonials. The interviews she used were not very interesting and the main takeaway I took from them were - setting up your own web business means that I can make money even while I sleep.If you are interested in getting your book published, she does provide you with good resources on how to do so. However, if you are looking for exciting Website books - this probably isnt the right book for you.Nadine - www.herstoknow.com"
2,Of Limited Use,"If your business is writing and selling self-improvement books, then this for you. It gives examples on how to publish and distribute your trade.If you are trying to target a niche (e.g. members on your NON-Self-improvement directed website) with the hopes of generating data that could be useful to them, than you should look elsewhere."
3,A Little Heavy On Publishing,"It's a great book if you're looking to publish a book. I expected information on how to actually structure the content of an information product, like an e-Book, but there's nothing like that. For me, the best part of this book are the infopreneur profiles at the end of each chapter...very enlightening."
4,Wealth of Ebook Info,I still have to re-read this book and absorb all the great information. It is a keeper...one to go back to again and again.
2,For the beginner's beginner,"This book is for people who are almost entirely unfamiliar with the info product field. If you're a writer who's already pushed to get your work out there, if you've started a semi-successful website or blog, or if you have a semi-successful service- or product-based business, I'm going to guess you already know a thing or two about marketing, e-commerce, etc.As such, this book is too basic. Each chapter was like a good first chapter of a whole book that could've been written with more detail and guidance. I wish the author had taken chapters 7-10 and wrote more about those topics alone, and included more in-depth coverage and real insider tips.Bottom line: If you're looking to dip your toes in the water, this book will do the trick. It's a simple and cursory glance (in the style of ehow.com) at the whole info product field. If you're already in the water (say, knee or waist deep) and were looking to boost your game or refine your knowledge, you'll be pretty disappointed."
2,Focuses on Traditional Publishing,"When I bought this book on Amazon I was hoping to get some tips and resources for the burgeoning world of online content -- eBooks, reports, newsletters, etc. In that regard, this book was a disappointment. 90% of the content relates to authors who are publishing for print. If you are getting a book traditionally published or self-published, you may benefit. If your focus is online content, I would keep looking.I feel like the title misrepresents the content. ""Getting your book published"" or ""publishing and marketing your book"" are more apt. If I didn't feel a little duped by the promise of content, I would probably up my rating to 3 stars. Only chapter 6 and maybe part of chapter 7 (less than 20 pages) focus on anything other than the traditional publishing model."
4,Great book for entrepreneurs who need to reinvent themselves!,"Stephanie Chandler wrote a great book. I especially liked that she profiled experts such as Dan Poynter who are clearly top at how they are using their content to create a business. I especially liked her chapter on creating buzz as a book author. The specific samples that she gave can be duplicated and used immediately. If you want to understand how to monetize content, this is a good book to purchase.Melinda Emerson@smallbizlady[...]"
4,Opened my eyes to the possibilities of online sales,"I didn't no much about online sales before I read this book. I was so surprised by many of the ways people are making money online, and now I am trying to emulate them and do it myself.Some things you might not know!- One lady sells tips booklets online and makes an extraordinary amount of money. These are not even original tips, but she on-sells them and they are only a few dollars so you end up buying a few. Great idea - use it in your website.- If you have a book, make it an e-book, then split it into chapters and sell as cheaper products. Includes ideas for multiple ways to use your own content.- Referred me to ""The Publicity Hound"" whose e-zine I love and is full of useful information for marketing and publicityRecommended if you have just started with online business."
4,An overlooked album,"I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I have this on vinyl and only after buying it on CD did I like it! What's that about? A bad pressing??This is straight up a fantastic album. When I first started playing the guitar I think I wore out my copies of ""Mudlark"", ""Greenhouse"" and ""Dreams and all that stuff"". This album continues in that same fine tradition.This is record is so good that if you bother to go find it, ""Hayseed Suede"" is sampled on a Madvillain song! If the hip hoppers are digging this deep, it's gotta be good. get it and learn how it's done by the Fernand Leger of fingerstyle guitar."
1,Extremely poor reproductions,Guess my title says it all. This book was a big disappointment. The reproductions are so faint it's not worth buying.
3,Typical Dover book,Nothing new to see and disappointed. On kindle some pics are sideways and hard to view. Need better art books for kindle
3,"Interesting device, but a little slow","I enjoyed working with this device, and it was definitely worthwhile for the learning experience, but it was slow, so that I had to move on to a different solution. I wouldn't trade it, except for a better way to get a disk conveniently on the network.Regards,proclus[...]"
3,A bit silly but I enjoyed it,"I read this book in just a few days while on vacation. While I certainly wouldn't put it anywhere near the Outlander series, it's a good escape anyway. The hero is so clueless I giggled most of the way through the book. I don't normally read romance novels but if you want a serious story I'd skip this one."
2,Readable but don't recommend it. This is a formulaic romance novel.,"It has the required characters and plot movement but it was lacking somehow. I compare this story to a soft drink that lost its fizz. There was nothing sparkling, surprising or delighting. A few times I wished it would be over. The hero is gruff and loses his temper a lot. He meets her and then over a short time, his heart starts melting for her. I would prefer more interesting interaction between them to justify his heart melting. Surely he has been around females in the past that he didn't melt for, so why this one?Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: five. Setting: 1311 Scotland and 1996 New York City. Copyright: 1996. Genre: time travel romance.For a listing of my reviews of other Lynn Kurland books, see my 2 star review of ""Dreams of Stardust"" posted on 6/23/08."
2,"Fun, but the heroine can be irritating!","I found the concept intriguing, as I adore Diana Gabaldon, but was disappointed in the characters. Elizabeth whined a bit too much and there were conflicting character traits; in the beginning of the book she's a slob, yet the first thing she does upon arriving at Jamie's keep is complain how dirty it is, and then she cleans it! And Nolan's character was a bit too gratuitous... This was a fun read, but ultimately not satisfying."
1,Waste of Time,"A complete waste of time. So many people jump through time so often, that the whole concept becomes laughable. The challenge of time-travel novels is to make an unbelievable concept seem possible. This novel failed miserably. Also, the characters were not developed enough, some characters (such as Jaime's brother) just appear at the perfect time with little or no explanation, and for a historical romance, there's absolutely no history. You would be much better off reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander."
5,"""THE BEST TIME-TRAVEL ROMANCE OF ALL TIMES!","""A DANCE THROUGH TIME"" is by far the best time-travel romance ever writen. I love this book, I have lost count how many times i've read it. I know it by memory. The fact,that is so sweet and funny. It remained me of ""BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"". How rough and mean he started out in the beginning only for the heroine to discover, what a prince lay underneath"
1,Best Book I've Ever Read!!!,This book was one of the best I have ever read. It was charming and funny. The character were well drawn and the setting was realistic. I love this book and can't wait for the others to come to my area!!
1,She's phoning it in,"I believe Ms. Kurland has the ability to write a book as enjoyable as Dianna Gabaldon's series of books but for some reason (perhaps her editor's) has not truly applied herself. The premise of the book is entertaining and the series of adventures which befall the characters are interesting but they are not sufficiently developed. Ms. Kurland makes flat statements and expects the reader to suspend all rational thought and blindly accept the premise that is presented. The shame of it is, if she expanded on the various situations, had the characters live what she is describing, had more dialogue and less exposition, these books could be truly entertaining."
3,"An interesting concept, but somewhat dull.","Although this book has an interesting concept (and I am intrigued by time travel), it was somewhat dull. I enjoyed some of the story and did finish the book. However, the characters seemed a bit sophmoric (particularly the female) and Ms. Kurkland needs to take a course in writing love scenes -- this book is definitely rated ""G."""
3,Quite cute,"If there was ever a book that would make you believe in love again I think it would be this one. Kurland's characters are so perfect in their own flawed ways, they are truely believable and very real. There is no perfectly in control of her self Barbie seducing a senstive Ken, but a Highlander laird who vows no women will disrupt his life and a sweet, fragile NYer involved with a man who does not really love her. Between the battles, the time hopping, Jamie's grumbling, and Elizabeth's sweetness, this book rates as a top notcher. Granted, not her best work, but much better than those Romantic histories that end up making us average women feel lees than enough...at least we can compare ourselves..and our mates (wink) to her characters. Pick this oine and the rest of her romances up..you'll not be disappointed."
5,"Excellent, another wonderful story",I adore Time-travel books. Whenever I find one I send of to Amazon for it as I cannot get that many in England. Jamie and Elizabeth are brilliant. As soon as you meet Jamie you will fall in love with him. I loved the part of the story when Jamie is talking to Elizabeth's dad on the phone. It makes me laugh so much even before you get to the part. I have read this book about 6 times and I never get fed up with it. This book is a must for any Time-Travel or Lynn Kurland fan. Well done.
1,Don't waste your money on this onel.,"After reading the Diana Gabaldon books, I looked for something similar. Lynn Kurland's books are always listed. So I bought one and couldn't finish it. She tells the reader everything rather than showing us the scenery, the landscape, etc. I believe this woman is actually published. My 4th grade students write better narrative than she does. I didn't check, but I'd guess this drivle is about on a 3rd grade reading level. So my advise is: ""Don't waste your money on this one."""
1,A pale imitation of Outlander...,"Like several others, I bought this book because I was completely enchanted by Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. I don't normally read ""romance"" novels but Gabaldon blew me away. After reading her books then a 4-part scifi series (the Hyperion saga--another great read) this book was a bitter disappointment. It reminded me exactly why I don't read romance novels. The plot didn't build...the charachters just ended up in situations. Nor was I happy with the charachter development--same complaint. The bright spot in this book is probably toward the end, Kurland's concept of time and time travel is interesting, although not developed enough.This is really a poorly written book."
1,Ugh!,Ugh! That's what kept repeating in my mind as I read this book. The heroines oneliners will cause your eyes to roll. Without any real character development the only thing that brings the hero and heroine together is the fact that they are of opposite sex. This is a sit-com (a bad one) of a book.
1,Too silly to finish,"Although the thought of time traveling to another century to find a the man of your dreams seems appealing, the story was so utterly unbelievable, it spoiled a perfectly good plot! I couldn't finish this book and I always finish what I start. Try reading Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series for a really believable but unbelievably intoxicating experience!"
3,Entertaining,"This book has some very amusing moments in it, but Elizabeth's crying and whining is so annoying that I had to keep putting the book down. This is the first book of L. Kurland's that I have read, so I will give her another chance. Hopefully, the heroine will be a little bit stronger."
5,A modest book..good reaad..Great story,"This was an excellent book. I read Romance novels every weekend and I am used to reading novels that have heavy sexual encounters, light wit, and extended story line until the heavy sex can come into play because of course the girl is always a frightened virgin who happened to save herself for the right man (even if he does live 700 years in the past).But this book was wonderful...There were innuendo's as far as the love scenes were concerned..it may be considered a little light and some what teasing and misleading for those who are used to Beatrice Smalls novels, but for those of you who are lavryle spencer readers (like I started out) this brings you back to modest, love that leaves you to imagine the physical actions between the hero and the heroine...not everything needs to be spelled out step by step...A great novel with charming characters....A good read."
4,Love time travel,"I just love a good time travel novel, especially when romance is mixed into the adventure. I'd put this one up there with ""Twilight"", by Nicholas Stember."
3,A Good Time Travel Romance...But Not Her Best.,"This book started out great but towards the end starts to loose steam. Maybe It's just that I prefer to keep the hero of the story in his own time. It's just hard for me to immagine a medieval Highland laird fitting into the 20th century so quickly. Also, the author brings in Patrick, Jamie's younger brother, too late in the book. I think it would have been better to bring him in earlier in the story. In this book's defense, it was nice to see the heroine, Elizabeth, stand up for herself and not be so easily controlled. I also enjoyed the picture the author painted of medieval Scotland. All in all it is a good read, just not her best."
2,Confusing and stiff!,"This book is not for the beginner and it is harder and more confusing than necessary. Also it is somewhat stiff in the overall tone. There are better, easier and more complete books out there."
2,"A thin but still pleasing set of F1 ""profiles in courage""","With 100+ photos but only 4-5 pages on each of 13 Formula One World Champions, this Alan Henry book is neither comprehensive nor detailed. Yet it still manages to delve behind the helmets and provide some riveting moments in the careers of each of these tremendously gifted athletes. Henry's profile of Englishman James Hunt is particularly good, but many will question the logic (if any) that went into selecting the drivers for this book, since it leaves out so many great F1 champions."
1,Useless,"Man, you can find the information (the terrible brief information) about each of the drivers here in any cheap Internet web site!"
2,JUST FOR THE PAYCHECK,"It's sad when an expert newsman like Alan Henry writes such a weak book about great F-1 champions. He can ( and indeed have !! ) write much better books than this one, where the photos save the day ..."
4,Babes in Toyland Live,"Billed as Babes in Toyland's last live performance, Minneapolism contains 17 live songs, including some from my favorite album; Nemesisters. Babes in Toyland was the band that got me into female-fronted punk rock, but I had no idea this album even existed until I found it by happy accident in a used music store. Unfortunately it does sound like an amateur recording, and the quality isn't always great. But it's PUNK ROCK!! What do you think it's supposed to sound like?"
2,Where's the sound?,This album would get 5 stars if i did'nt have to turn my CD player on full bast just to hear it
1,I thought this book was a waste of money and time,"Pretty lame. All of it was just common sense except for the ""blame it on your parents part"" which I thought was totally off base. I thought the simplicity of the way it was written and the tone was actually a bit condescending."
3,A little disapointed,"Blames Mom and dad for reoccuring problems with relationships, which I don't agree with. I breezed right through this book and I didn't really learn anything new from it."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book was plain horrible, it didn't help me at all.Go for the similarly topic-ed book by Delphine Hirsh...MUCH BETTER!"
2,Don't call that man,"The book was interesting I appreciated the ideas and concepts, but I have read better books. I thought it was more teenager than I liked."
5,Ignore the dippy graphics and lame title,"This is the best book I have ever read on the topic of getting over a wrenching breakup, and I have read a bunch. I cringe every time I see the cover, but I have read and re-read the section on The Ambivalent Man which described my own situation perfectly and have determined is profound. Seriously, if you're just about to die from heartache and can't seem to move on even though your ex is, this book will really help make the edge of that pain a little less sharp. Don't let the outside fool you--this book is full of excellent information and makes me wish I had found it sooner."
3,"If you're clinging to the past, this is a good resource","This book is a good read even if you are not experiencing a compulsive urge to ""call that man"" but are ready to explore reasons why you are clinging to a past relationship. I am in my mid-20s and found many parts of the book, particularly the explanation of the ""grief/mourning process"" of a lost relationship, very clear and helpful."
1,Disappointed After the Hyped Reader Reviews,"...not so great...i've read many books on the subject to date and this is not one of the better ones -- people say it was a concise capsule on 'not calling' but i dunno.....very pat, a smattering of what is in one of the many other books on this subject -- it's like a list -- not really helpful, nothing you haven't heard somewhere else put out far more in depth."
1,God-awful,"This book is not the best choice for such a delicate matter. I had nowhere to turn, and somebody passed this on to me. They had 'read' it, but hadn't 'used' it (BIG difference). The beginning of the book was very good. It was VALIDATING to read about just how much other guys (and gals) like me, feel the way I do. It was also inspiring to know that 'guys like me' who aren't supposed to get their hearts broken.Whether this is true or not... didn't matter. the point is I was validated for feeling awful and feeling ashamed of myself on top of that. The book really takes a dive after about chapter two. The techniques here are out of date, old-fashioned, and hurtful to both parties. I never did get 'over' the person involved; not with this book anyway. Try out 'how to survive the loss of a love' instead by McWilliams: Much better stuff. I highly recommend it."
5,This was the best book I have ever read!!,"I don't know what to say or where to start to express how I am very grateful about this author, because her book changed my life forever!! I had hard time with letting go the ambivalent man as she called them! but I am now feel confident and triumphant!!! Thank you so much for the helpful advises!! we love you all"
1,This book made me even more angry,"In short, this book is inane. It is not introspective in the least and it did not make me feel better. It made me feel even angrier that I was having to get over a break up. It's not worth the read if you're really trying to understand what happend without subscribing to cliches."
4,I can so relate!!!,"I read this book after a break-up. This guy will not talk to me, explain anything to me, and he wants nothing to do with me. I felt so lost, so i bought this book, partly because of the title.Even though I still continue to think about him and email him once and awhile,get lonely and miss him, and REALLY WANT TO CALL HIM!!! it still really helped me out. I could relate to all of the girls stories in here some way or another. Its a wonderful book and it really shows you that your not the only one whos gone through this situation. And at times like this, that is the most comforting thing. The exercises are good, except theres a little too much on the ""father figure"" part. But besides that, this book is wonderful, and hey...if occupying yourself reading this book is gonna take your mind off the jerk who broke your heart even for a bit, then its worth it.(because you can't read and talk on the phone at the same time!!) I definatly recomend it."
1,No way I could recommend,I considered this a boring boring book. No way to keep a person interested and no real help to overcome emotions
4,A little gem of a book,"Don't let the hokey bookcover fool you - this book has tons of great insights and suggestions - packed into a quick read. A must read for any woman thinking (or obsessing!) about ""calling that man"" after the break-up. Don't do it - read this book instead."
2,Not matt black!,"The porcelain is decent quality, but the colour is certainly not the matt black it appears in the picture! Instead it's a sparkly lightish black, or a fake metallic gold. Not at all what we expected, and certainly not what we hoped."
4,Excellent Collection!,"Definitely hits a lot the high points. Would be worth five stars except for the price ($35??) and it's missing one of my favorites, Truth, Rest Your Head, from Olympian. If you're willing to spend $35, Rising for Sunset might be a better value. That's live recording of great Gene songs. The band sounds quite a bit different live, a little rougher around the edges, and has some arrangements that are quite a bit different from the studio versions."
5,its a Loomis Rod what else needs to be said.,"I own several so I knew what I was getting. Excellent choice for winter run Steelhead. Use this one for back bouncing skein. Sensitivity allows for detection of subtle bites. Eyelets are large enough to minimize icing problems, however in certain instances it still does occur.The tip has enough pliability and have never had problem requiring replacement on any Loomis rod I own.As a side bar, for any Walleye fisherman, the Walleye series are phenomenal jigging rods. Really quick on the set, even in deep (40 plus) feet of water. I have several other Walleye rods and for jigging you can really see the difference."
4,halfpack2000@yahoo.com,"i think this lp is a very good one. i especially like the song day and night.rock and roll you out,and you don't like us are also excellent.i bought this album in 1974 when it first came out. I'd never heard of man or any of the bands any of the members had ever played in.i am so glad that i bought it on a whim.no disappointments,just good guitar,lyrics,...it's not heavy like the scorpions or judas priest,but it's just as good!check it out!kick out the jams!"
5,"Two Great Albums, One Great CD","Brinsley Schwartz are best known as the founders of the pub movement, but these albums come from their early country rock period, and surprisingly, they are both excellent. Fans of classic rock artists like The Band, The Dead and The Byrds will find much to admire here, as will fans of modern alt country acts like Wilco and Son Volt. DESPITE IT ALL is better than the eponymous album, because the psychedelic influence is less, but it's a fairly small difference. Tracks of note include `Slow One', `Hymn To Me' `Funk Angel' and especially `Country Girl'. These old albums are hard to find, even in good second hand record shops, so I suggest if you want em, buy em here."
1,Caveat emptor,"Editorially this is a fabulous collection, both albums. Unfortunately the pressing I received was completely out of order and distorted. Beware."
3,a bit too cutesy for me,"Former PA of successful movie-making Hero who has sexual-trauma issues agrees to get married to widowed Hero to secure her custody of her young stepbrother. Although their marriage is a temporary arrangement, Hero truly desires a permanent marriage with heroine b/c he's been in love with her since he 1st met her when he was married.This Singh book was meaty but it seemed a bit contrived. Singh seemed to want to hit every Harlequin romance novel cliche (i.e., wealthy alpha male, virgin heroine, marriage of convenience, pregnancy). She did a good job on expounding on the r/s, which made the book a more worthwhile read. It was lacking in emotional pull though. Dialogue was sometimes unclear & I didn't like Hero's babying the heroine & calling her cutesy love names. I did like hero's integrity & his sensitivity & determination re: heroine. Love scenes were sensual. Overall, it was a cute romance but it could've been better.Somewhat recommended."
3,AWAKEN TO PLEASURE,"Disappointing after my first Singh novel two days ago.The hero depicted on the cover is so not the hero described by Nalini. Nothing at all.And why set these books in New Zealand? Coulda been in Shamokin for all the setting told us.She was a whiney, poor me, supposedly sexually abused but not really heroine. I was sick of her whining.He, the gentle lover who miraculously turned her fears to morph her into a devil in bed. Huh? Yeah and after only the day after their marriage of convenience nuptials.He strong armed through the threats of his Italian mob connected family back in the old country.He became more ethnically Italian as the book went on decorating his pillow talk with Italian words of endearment. Huh?It was mediocre at best. I sure hope this was the worst of her novels cause she's gonna get old to me real soon otherwise."
2,FUSION MOODY,"Hey, it's James Fusion, complete with synthesiser, electric bass and a noticable conga drummer - with an R&B beat. Not my bag. If it's yours, there are four more tracks of James with synthesiser backing on MOVING FORWARD."
5,Terrific Book,"I really like this book and I currently require it for my students in my speech classes. As a theatre professor, I've used many texts over the years and this seems the most practical and engaging. My one recommendation would be to purchase the CD that comes with it."
1,"great film,poor video",The Hired Hand is a great film but the quality of the video was so poor that it would not play correctly in my machine.I look foward to the DVD.
1,Flat-footed Fonda Failure for Die-hards Only,"Oh dear: ""masterpiece""? really? Did I watch the same film? ""The Hired Hand"" is amateur night all the way. Fonda can't act, he can't direct, and he sure as hell can't direct himself acting.Imagine a musical scale made up of three half-steps. That's his acting range. Kind of like a male Raquel Welch or Halle Berry. He ruins everything he's in with his soulless incompetence.The film begins with some interesting visuals, but from the first lines I knew the movie would suck hard and that I would wind up not giving a flying f--k about any of the characters. And I'm no psychic, not by any means.Visually it's ugly, making do with whatever the light happens to be. Silver-blue and lots of washed-out mid-day green."
2,Not my favorite...,This is just an average eye cream and would do well for those in their teens/early twenties who have normal skin. It didn't do much for my dry skin area and didn't seem to do anything for the fine lines that are just beginning to appear as I enter my late twenties. I find Neutrogena's Healthy Skin eye cream to provide much more moisture and better for reducing the appearance of fine lines in the eye area.
3,it's just OK.,"I've been using the second bottle now and it is OK if you have normal skin, but if you have dry skin or find line, it doesn't help at all."
1,this is music?,"Jeez, if you really like playing dissonant eighth notes using only two strings, with a backing track that's so jazzy it doesn't even sound good... then this book is for YOU!I bought this book after I bought a 7-string thinking I could learn something new and interesting. It would be nice if the other strings were used occasionally, and if you listen to the practice CD, the only thought you'll be left with is ""Why would anyone want to play music that sounds like this?""I can see a very small amount of usefulness here if you are such a great jazz guitarist that you don't need ""keys"" and ""music"" holding you down. Just about any other jazz guitar book would be a better buy than this one."
4,Very good devotionals - Check out the companion CD,"This is a great collection of devotionals, mostly written by Gigi Graham Tchividjian with some poetry included by her mother, Ruth Bell Graham. This is a great book to use as a devotional to spend time with. Each chapter is centered around a hymn. It is well worth noting that there is a companion CD with instrumental versions of the hymns also available. It carries the same title as this book and is by Jeff Johnson, Brian Dunning & John Fitzpatrick. The CD is a great companion piece to this book and this book is a great companion piece to the CD. Both are highly recomended."
4,Raw and visceral,"The writing is pretty vivid. I have to keep reminding myself ""These are Nazis fighting"" because I keep thinking of them as just anyone...which I supposed could be part of teh larger point of the book."
2,nice hat BAD fit,i purchased this had for my husband and when it arrived it did not fit. it is oversized.
3,"Plain fitted Hat - Khaki, size 7.",I ordered two of these hats. However when I got them and tried them on one fitted me perfectly but the other one was too tight and needs to be stretched out. I like the hat that fits but I think the seller should place a little more control of the sizes it ships to insure they are what they say they are.
2,beware,my daughter and niece both received these for Christmas - my daughter's car won't stay running unless we duct tape doea and boots down and my nieces runs through batteries after about 1 hourthe kicker here is trying to find motorized cars without replacing the whole set - GOOD LUCK
5,Great Product,"I haven't seen the commercial for this product, however it works great. It works exactly like the 'tape' lint rollers except you don't have to replace the 'tape'. You just drop a little bit of dish detergent or liquid soap on the roller and hold it under a faucet and the lint and hair come right off. You can also put some dish detergent or liquid soap in a jar full of water and swish it around in the water and the lint and hair will come right off the roller. Plain water doesn't seem to work much at all, but soapy water works awesome for removing the hair and lint."
3,So So Product,I was excited to order this and give it a try but turns out its not really that better than my lint paper rollers. Yes you don't have to rip papers off rollers but it doesn't pick up that well. One roll on your shirt and you have to rinse it under water and wait for it to dry or else it won't pick up any more lint. It's kind of frustrating actually. I'd rather stick to my precut paper lint rollers from petco.
4,Drying the lint roller,When using this type of roller after the hair/dirt is washed off I swipe my hand down the roller to remove excess water & then quickly wipe with a piece of lint free cloth. Then I squeeze it until I feel the stickiness return. Takes about 30 seconds to do this & it's ready to go again. Much better than sticky paper rollers....
1,not practical,having to wash off the cat hair after every use and wait for it to dry makes it impractical. Guess I'll go back to the old way.
2,Not worth the money,I took a chance purchasing this product even after reading the not-so-good reviews. I used it maybe 20 times and threw it away since it wasn't picking up the cat hair any more. It's a waste of money.
2,Not very convenient,Works okay. Washes off easy. But found it to be a pain to have to wash it off every few strokes. Then can't use it right away bc it will need to dry.
3,Requires continual washing,"We acquired several of these to deal with hair shed from a new puppy. The roller works as advertised and easily removes the hair, however, after cleaning a small area, definitely less than the front of a man's shirt in size, the roller must be rinsed and allowed to dry. It then is fully reuseable as advertised but the time required to do all this makes the roller of value only when you have a small area to clean.Within that limitation the rollers work fine."
2,Meh,"This item is NOT very sticky at all and only lasts a few strokes before you have to wash it off.. even if there's not a lot of lint/etc on the roller. It does what it says, and i guess not bad for the price, but i'd pay a little more to have more stickiness. I guess I was thinking it would be as sticky as one of those sticky rubber ""hand"" toys that stretch and grab paper and small things ... after they get dirty, you wash them and they are super sticky. not this thing. Oh well."
1,Not at all useful unless you are near soap and water,"I have pets at home and sometimes wind up at work with fuzzy pants. I loved the idea of a lint remover with a roll that did not need replacing. However, these fill with lint in just a couple of swipes, and need to be cleaned several times just to de-lint one pair of pants. While it's easy enough to clean, it does require running water to remove the lint from this roller. It's just not at all convenient for me, I'm back to the masking tape roll."
3,Handbook of Magazine Article Writing,"Although most of the information was valid, the book was a 2005 edition and some information was seriously outdated. Trends, styles and demographics too old to be useful."
4,writers digest handbook of Magazine article writing,I really haven't gone through all of it. Had some decent information that I am sure I will put to good use.
2,Very very basic...save your $$$,"Granted, this is a few years old, but it was likely out of date even then. The information in this paperback is readily accessible online virtually anywhere-you aren't getting anything exceptionally helpful or detailed. The information is so general that one would suspect it of fitting in more with a high school English class than for a freelancer. Additionally, you aren't given the contact information as Writer's Market supplies.A few things: plagiarism is covered in 2 or 3 pages. Not only is it very basic knowledge, but it doesn't even explain the different styles of citation. ""Editor"" tips are also basic...a little bit of time on Google and you'd likely yield more precise information from better sources.Save your money...."
4,Help for the helpless,"Although I felt there was a little too much time spent on other authors' personal experiences, overall the explanations of how to be a success in the magazine writing game were well written and understandable. This is a good source for the beginner and the experienced author alike. The Writers Market for the current year is an ideal companion to this book."
1,Press `Back' and try another title,"The world of pattern recognition has a nice theoretical background and this guy just ignores it, thus it's hard to read and understand something from it; you may try reading a more complicated subject from a more complicated book (e.g. read probability from Kallenberg's monograph) and expect to understand more things on the world we live on. Additionally, the notation is awful, maybe it's the reason that he seems to have used TeX (which makes up the star), but worse than a novice math author; my own assignment reports have better notation, and are more rigorously written but I don't want people to waste paper and spend energy on marketing this thing.If you're a student, REALLY think of spending $100 on more useful things."
1,fall apart overpriced mirror,This mirror is a ridiculous price for the quality. It started falling apart 1 day after using it and never did work the way it was supposed to. It would not even stay propped up and then the mirror started coming unglued and falling off the backing.
2,A Rip Off,I bought the mirror in June and was thrilled with the 10X magnification with light. I used it everyday until August 24 when the cord developed a short. Now all that I have is an unlit 10X magnification mirror. I am so disappointed in the quality. For the price and only 2 months of use this item is a rip off.
2,meh,"I really like the size of this mirror, and its adjustable height & horizontal swivel. In that sense, it is really good for traveling. But it simply fails because only one of the two mirrors is actually lit. What a poor design choice. Note to Zadro: if you're going to include two mirrors, you should include two lights. I really don't need my face in the regular mirror to be lit from below like some creepy horror-movie face. So I end up: 1.) using natural light (which sort of defeats the purpose of having a mirror with a light), or 2.) tilting the mirror on it's side to use the light from the magnified mirror, in addition to some other light source for the other side of my face. That is a pain. I think if they included a light on the regular mirror, and not just the magnified one, I would give this mirror 4 or 5 stars. Please, Zadro, fulfill my perfect-travel-mirror-dream and light both mirrors."
3,Lighted Make up mirror,Very handy and has a bag for travelling. For the price I paid; I was expecting a bigger mirror than what I got.
3,not long lasting,"Loved this mirror...it just didn't last more than two years...the light burned out. I like that it was compact and could be folded away. I didn't use it for travel, it always sat in the same place...but I am here to buy something different that will hopefully last laonger than two years."
2,not so great,I really liked this mirror when I first got it. I was excited that it seemed portable. It ended up being a pain. The weight of the mirror would collapse itself when I was using it. The weird design ended up being bad because you cannot maneuver the mirror very well. The cord was really short so I couldn't use the mirror in very many places. There's a built in alarm that would go off every day and I never set an alarm on the mirror. The bulb eventually burnt out and almost electrocuted me.
2,No Longer Has AC Adapter Included - they charge EXTRA for that!,My wife really likes this make-up mirror and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if they hadn't changed what is included. This is the third one she's had since she first found them. The other two came with the AC Adapter. So when I ordered this one I ASSUMED it would be the same. Stupid me! They now makle you buy one separately! And if you try to purchase from Zadro (the manufacturer) they will soak you more for the shipping than for the adapter! (The adapter plus shipping is almost one-half of the price of the mirror!)WHAT A RIP OFF!
2,too small and low,"I find this mirror much too small and unless you are putting it on a shelf too low. The lighted mirror is the lower one and it only raises an inch or two up making it necessary to bend down to look into. If you have a shelf for it, that would work. I kept it anyway to use when traveling as it is portable and will run off of batteries. I just hold it so I can see!"
2,Lighted mirror,"I just want to say that if you want a lighted makeup mirror, don't waste your money on this one because it has ""bells and whistles"". It apparently has an LED clock and alsrm clock, but I could never get it to work. The light does not work, but the alarm goes off every morning at 4am and I am not able to reset it. The magnification is very good(too good) but you could spend a fraction of the money for a drugstore cheap version."
3,Issue with Size,"The Product is well made, however, I find it difficult to use. Both mirrors should be a bit larger in circumference."
4,I like this product,I like the portability and adjustability of this mirror. It takes up little space and can be stowed away very compactly. It serves my needs very well. I was disappointed that only the magnifying mirror is lit. I tend to use the normal mirror more often. The other is the clock loses it's setting when I stow it away. It has to be reset and left out if you were really wanting to use the clock feature. As far as I am concerned...I was looking for a mirror and really could care less about the clock.
5,recommend,It is great for someone needing glasses to apply make-up or to do your eyebrows. Also great to take along for travel.
3,Wish it held up better,"Zadro Ultimate Lighted Make-up Mirror two times I have had to have the mirror replaced. The top mirror broke off both times. Too bad, because otherwise it's a great little mirror."
4,zadro ulimate lighted make up mirror,I bought this mirror because my Sharper Image travel mirror broke. I really loved that mirror bacause it had a nice snap on cover for traveling and the light source was bright. The Zadro mirror is a an acceptable replacement even though it could use a few improvements. I do not like the flip style mirror because it is not removable. This causes the mirror topple over when I am using the magnified mirror side. I also think the light source could be much brighter. It does fold up nicely for traveling though and the price was right.
1,disappointed,"looking forward to the mirror arriving. It worked great for one day and then........nothing. The light would not work, what a disappointment. The only good thing I can say is that the mirror itself was of good quality."
2,poor quality,this item would be perfect if not for poor quality. The lighging is very dim and the mirror does not stay in place when the height is adjusted.
4,Nice little radios,"These Audiovox have met our expectations. They have a great range - not any bleeding of channels so far (even in the mall) and they are lightweight and compact. We used these in our cars on our 700 mile move last month, and they worked great on the interstate (no CB interference and we even took them into the rest stops as a safety feature). My only complaint is that the belt clips are not very flexible, and both clips broke fairly easily (within 2 months). I would recommend these if you're looking for an inexpensive 2 way radio system."
4,dynamic live performer,"I was stationed at camp pendleton in the mid 60's and had the oppotunity to see johnny at the whiskey a cple times before being shipped to the far east. he is such a dynamic live performer. based on that i bought these 2 albums on vinyl at that time and i still have them some 40 years later, and relished the opportunty to get them on cd. i also have back at the whiskey a go-gorick burr usmc 1964-1968"
1,Not what I remember,"My mother had Johnny Rivers Live at the Whiskey A Go Go on album back in the mid sixties. It was completely different than what is offered here. I distinctly remember several songs that aren't on this collection. He did his own version of Suzy-Q. Also had Stop in the name of love, and Land of 1000 dances. If I thought about it long enough I'm sure I could think of others that aren't there as well. I was only 12 or 13 back then. I loved that album and wore it out completely. So where did these songs go? This being a two album set that's currently offered I have no way of knowing which songs are supposedly from which album? But I do know that this isn't right. I really wanted to buy that album again but this is so completely different and wrong!"
3,not there best effort,"I love the black keys. I have all there previous albums, and this one is probably thier weakest one to date. Its still an alright cd to listen to, but it is just not up to par with the rest of there work in my opinion."
3,"Far from original, but decent enough","Magic Potion starts out with a bang-the rickety, punishing ""Just Got To Be"" really impressed me, enough that I thought I knew I was going to love this album. Not so. I'm afraid it begins to peter out and become quite repetitive and uninspiring as it drags on for another 40 minutes. Not worth a buy, but not terrible music.For those of you who are wondering what this sounds like, think White Stripes plays Bad Company. In fact, the whole thing sounds like a Bad Company album with the bass and some shiny, radio friendly production stripped out. If that does it for you, buy away!"
5,An air guitarist's dream,"Great rock that one can listen straight through - 'One I love' is a slow haunting ballad, so emotional and loving that the guitars weep."
5,The best album you will ever hear,"This was my intro to Black Keys. Really, ""You're the One"" was, and it expanded to the rest of the album. I listened to it non-stop for 2 months. EVERY song on here is highly recommended. Also, it's the perfect mix of being mainstream enough to hear it in, say, ""Chuck"", but not too mainstream so your friends still think you listen to cool, obscure bands.Listen to the previews, and if your ears are not blown off the sides of your head, then you might not like this. In that case, go listen to Jay-Z and Justin Bieber. Those who do have good taste in music will be downloading this album with gaping holes where their ears used to be."
4,Another solid album,"First off it is another solid album from the Black Keys. In my opinion Black Keys albums get better the more times you listen. Their albums are the kind you just listen to and don't look for certain songs, you just push play and let it go. And this is another example of that. It's raw, gritty, and unfiltered great music. I only gave it four stars because I believe their isn't as much varieties of style as other albums. Every song sounds about the same, but it is still very good. I never listened to any songs before I purchased it, I know who the Black Keys are and that is all I needed. If you are a Black Keys fan you probably already own it, but if your new to them, give it a listen. Once you get one of their albums I promise you will get more."
4,King's best since The Eye,"Well, King took a break from writing really in-depth stuff for a while with Spider's Lullabye and the Graveyard, but he's back in all his horror with Voodoo. If you are a King fan and have lost touch, grab Voodoo and it'll make you want to crank up his older stuff again. It's a refreshing return to his older style, with wild guitars, high-pitched and multiple dubbed choruses, and excellent musicianship from his faithful sidekick, Andy LaRocque, who, IMO, is a dynamic and explosive performer."
2,atleast it was better than the graveyard,after the crap production of the spiders lullabye and the graveyard it was nice to hear a cd of kings sound good again. too bad other than the loa house and one down two to go the cd musically is pretty boring. during this period of his career i was wondering if mabye roadrunner records knew he was on a decent downhill and thats why they let him go to metal blade. but other tan 2 cool songs and dimebag doing a solo on the annoying song voodoo this cd is a miss. next please.
5,you could easily fall...,"I have always liked Mercyful Fate much better than King Diamond, but I was more than pleasantly surprised with this album. I think it is King's best, and this is definitely the best guitar work I have heard on any album in years. Andy La Roque retains that awesome 80's guitar sound, full of catchy riffs and blazing solo's. Most bands today can barely hit a decent note, let alone solo. At any rate, this is a great album, and once again, King and co. produce a great METAL album. Newer ""metal"" bands should take a lesson (do you hear me Metallisellout?)"
4,"""David, what's the matter...?""","""Voodoo"" has to be the best Diamond album since ""Conspiracy"". King and LaRocque, with the rest of the band, are in fine form. The best story since ""The Eye"". All the songs have great timing and execution. Hebert is a fine addition to the band. Songs like ""LOA House"", ""Voodoo"", ""A Secret"" ""The Exprcist"" and ""The Cross Baron Samedi"" really stand out. LOVE the Louisiana setting."
5,The favourite recoding in my (large) collection,"I bought this album on vinyl many years ago on my first trip to the USA (aged 17) on a whim. It proved to be one of my most prized possessions, and when it got scratched in the late 80s I was so sad. Finding it again on CD (on a British label?) was like finding a lost brother.All the tracks have been the sound-track to parts of my life - the sense of being caught up by events in 'Dreidel', of the value of work in 'Bronco Bill', of how any romance can fail in 'Oh My', the hope of new love in 'If We Try' ... and so on. I return again and again to the music and lyrics here and regard this as Don McLean at his very best, capturing the essence of real life with lyrical and musical excellence.My favourite track is 'Falling Through Time', and that's where I am in life and love right now. This is not 'American Pie', but if you like that and enjoy gentle, moving folk-pop, this will become your best friend too."
5,Saw him on stage in a packed house in Austin,1976. My children and grandchildren carry his music on their mp3 players!He's a classic.
4,Well worth the money,"I enjoyed some of the cuts on the LP version enough to buy the CD. Narcicissma, Dreidle, and On The Amazon are quirky but fun to listen to. The other songs on the CD (including Don McLean's version of the Roy Orbison hit ""Falling"" are more than enough to make the CD worth the money."
5,Terrific,"This book is clear, well illustrated, easy to read, complete, and thoughtful. If I were stuck on a desert island and needed to build a house (and, er, had access to a good lumberyard) this would be the book to have. I have been reading through it like a novel, and feel I'm learning something on each page. It is written for thoughtful students or beginners, but is well stocked with tables and charts that give you all the detail you need to select the right size floor joists or concrete foundation walls for a new dwelling."
1,Good but old fashioned,"Note the quaint, outdated ""dwelling house"" in the title. This book almost describes how to build a 1940's house, with references to plank subfloors, counterweighted sashes, asphalt siding, etc. Even the writing sounds old, as from another era. Newer information is conspicuously tacked on, and an updated chapter by a different author is clumsily written. Too bad. Kind of ruins what was, in its day, probably a pretty good book.Anyway, the author's clear writing makes it enjoyable to read, so a beginner would probably still learn a lot."
5,Super Solution,"My indoor shorthair had severe hairball problems, despite almost daily doses of Laxatone or other similar products. Introduction of this food has virtually solved the problem...plus ""Mr. Finicky"" actually LIKES it!! Highly recommended and no more expensive than prescription or veterinarian-sold products."
3,big and heavy--but pretty,"This is a very pretty, very ornate belly ring. The blue in the stones is really striking. It is huge and kinda heavy though, and the photos don't show how huge it is. But I like it, even though I only wear it for special occasions."
4,Absorbing and Suspenseful,"I have just reread this book after many years, and it was just as charming and engrossing as the first time. Nevil Shute's work never fails to bring to life the characters and make real the settings, generally of young people trying to make their way in a world fraught with the upheaval of World War II. ""Landfall"" is a simple story built upon heartfelt emotion and the edginess of danger. It sets the cold technical and strategic details of war against the fumbling confusion of young people trying to find their way through the wilderness of first love. The plot is absorbing and suspenseful, the characters appealing, and the style first rate."
5,Therabath Pro Paraffin Bath,My wife has arthritis and this product gives some temporary relief to her pain. It seems to be quality constructed and works as stated in the literature.
4,TherabathPRO,"Does what it is supposed to do, but it would be nice if it had an on/off switch on the unit since I don't use it every day."
5,Therabath Paraffin Wax Bath,"I bought this for my father who was experiencing a lot of pain in his hands. After just one use, he reported that his hands felt so much better. He's had this bath for a month now and is still using it twice a day. His only complaint is he has to leave it plugged in 24 hrs a day because it takes so long for the wax to melt again once it has hardened."
1,disappointed,I purchased my spa less than a year ago and it no longer heats up. What a disappointment. I thought spending the extra money would give me a product that would serve me longer than a year. I don't recommend investing in this item.
1,Unhappy with Parrafin Bath,I returned this item - it did not heat the wax. I used it twice and then it would not heat and melt the wax. I was disappointed.
1,Questionable Return Policy,"I ordered this item online. Upon receiving the package at my home, without openingthe box, I decided I didn't want the paraffin bath. So I contacted this company toobtain a RMA number. I was given a number by a staff member. I immediately took the package to my local UPS Store and returned it to the seller. Weeks have gone by and I still haven't received a refund!!! Haven't even received any communication from company."
1,too small,I ordered the complete set of the Supergirl Stars and Butterflies floor mats the front floor mats are too small they don't even cover the floor I had to buy some other small mats to cover the floor they are pretty but small
1,not what I thought it was....,"Seems this one, by Manning, is obsessed with crossdressers/TV themes. The art isn't as good as others, the stories shorter. Wasn't to happy with this one in general. If you're not into boys dressed as girls taking it um.... .... ... run and hide...."
2,Nothing new,Most diet books will help you lose weight if you follow the plan religiously. The only problem is doing just that. The only thing that has worked for me to this point is not eating anything related to wheat.
3,It's a diet book,"I guess I'll never learn that a diet book is a diet book. Another one that doesn't seem to fit in with real life, on-the-go lives."
5,Stop looking for other weight loss books,"If you are serious about losing weight (body fat) and are interested in keeping it off for good, then this is the book for you. Not only does it provide you with solutions on how to lose weight, but it also contains the tools so that the weight never comes back on! Now that's what I'm talkin' bout'. No joke!!!Bam baby!!!"
1,same old same old,"I just received this book and am sending it right back! This is the same old tired don't eat fat, don't eat egg yolks, in fact if you look at a daily sample menu don't eat calories. While I agree with his tried, old , and true suggestions of exercise both weight resistance and aerobic as well as eating frequently to maintain metabolism his virtually fat free fruit and veggie eating regimen is more well suited to the Hollywood anorexic set. And by the way, though he says don't diet, his plan looks like a diet to me. Look people, we know what we need to do. Avoid fast and processed foods. Eat a diet rich in fruit, veggies, and yes egg yolks because that is where all of the nutrition lies. It's not easy and we frequently stumble because the answers are simple; it's the implementation that is hard. We are not perfect, but the egg INCLUDING the yolk is. Eat well and skip this book. I am so glad that I did not buy his infomercial babble as well. Try ""The Maker's Diet"" instead."
2,Fat That Doesn't Come Back,The book was more about him than anything else. It just went on and on and only about 50 pages were worth reading. This is definitely not worth the money. I am so glad I didn't get sucked into his $200 DVD stuff on TV.
2,Not what expected,I thought it would be an overview of the package you can buy directly from them but not so.The few examples of the food have nothing to do with how this program is being sold.
5,"Living a healthy, happy life....","I have never had a problem with weightloss but this book is more than that. Don't let the title fool you. This book is for anyone who is interested in living a healthy, happy life. It gives you the essentials for comlete health, starting with your self-esteem and visualizing your goals, to how and what to eat, and finally with the importance of cardio and resistance training and the roles all of these play in your general health. I have found this book invaluable and refer back to it often when I have questions. Finally a book that takes a honest, no nonsense approach to health and fitness. And it makes sense that if you live a healthy life you will naturally release fat, that will never, ever come back."
3,From the Chicago School of Guitar,"I had never heard of Harvey Mandel until I saw him in a small Philadelphia venue, called the Bijou Cafe, around 1978. He appeared with John Mayall.Harvey really performed dutifully for the rock/blues legend, John Mayall...but there was a point where the crowd departed its attention from the headliner and was screaming HARVEY...HARVEY.....!!!!! Mayall relented and Mandel stepped up.What a memorable moment.While I enjoy this album very much, I depart with most of the praise found on this page. It is more in the Jeff Beck vein than the Roy Buchanan, Elvin Bishop, or Rory Gallagher style. I enjoy much more the rock/blues sound than the fuzzy, hard-guitar jazz of Beck's ""Wired"".Technically, this album is fine, but just know what it is your buying. If you favor Beck over Bishop, then buy it. If you feel contrary to that, then go buy something else. If you are ambivalent, err on the side of saving your money for something you are more sure of.All best. Lee"
5,Exactly what I needed!,"I was having a problem with shorter latches due to them being attached to a concrete wall. Overtime the concrete began to crack since it was so near the edge and eventually there was nowhere left to attach a latch to. I finally found this latch, which allowed me to mount it much further back onto the concrete wall, where the wall is much stronger. This very heavy duty latch has been working flawlessly since I installed it about 4 months ago. There has never been a time when it didn't latch or get stuck. I would definitely recommend this latch."
1,A complete mess and not worth the while..,"This is my first (and last) book in the series. The start is very promissing, but suddenly you find yourself in the middle of a theater-play-like situation and the end is a completely awfull hunt for the ""bad girl"", on a lake. Its an unsuccesfull mixture of three different styles. Skip it."
1,Ugh!,"My God this book sucks! I am an avid reader. I have a Nook, a Kindle and 18 bookshelves of books. I read ALL the time. This is one of the worse books ever written. I am on page 339 - get to the damned story already - this is supposed to be a thriller - I'm not thrilled."
5,"Very Good Series, and Getting Better","Nina Reilly is a complex, interesting, realistic, and likable character. Jeff Riesner is a devious stuffed shirt you love to hate.Motion to Suppress, the first Nina Reilly book, was very good, and each succeeding book has been slightly better than the one before. I am looking forward to Acts of Malice.watziznaym@gmail.com"
4,A MAN'S MID LIFE CRISIS!!!!!,"What a fast pace wonderful enthralling story!!!Going through a mid-life crisis, Mike Markov decides to leave his spouse for a younger woman, who happens to work in their company. When Mike tells his wife Linda they he is leaving, Linda pushes the younger woman off a boat they are partying on into the water and she can't swim!!! Then in temper she pushes Mike in after her!!!!!Ultimately, the case goes to court where Nina and her cohorts representing Linda find twists and turns, some caused by her own client. Still, the intrepid Nina and her crack staff give their client the best representation an attorney can provide.BREACH OF PROMISE is a fabulous legal thriller because of the adept writing of Perri O'Shaughnessy look at a male's mid-life crisis from various perspectives without placing blame."
3,Not her best,"I am a big Nina Reilly fan and I have faithfully read the first three in order so I could watch the characters grow and develop. However, this was the most disappointing story thus far. I had pretty much figured out who did it and the resolution of events at the end was very drawn out. But, since I like her characters so much I'm going to keep going in the series. If you didn't like this one my advice is to read another in the series and give it one more try."
3,"Interesting premise, good leading character, but slow.","I've read all four Nina Reilly books. I thought this had the potential for a great story, but the trial was very erratic and somewhat slow. The pace picks up at the end but its not a very believable chase scene. However, the story still makes good for light summer reading, and Nina Reilly is an enjoyably leading character who always wins but never seems to get ahead."
1,Hardly gets moving,"Couldn't agree more with the reader from US who gave it a one star rating.Book is dull,slow moving that I gave up reading it.Was trying to give it a chance after all the 5 star reviews but I couldn't bring myself to continue the slow moving plot.The tight and fast suspense of authors like John Lescroart ,William Bernhardt and Lisa Scottoline for me anytime."
2,"Wrong, wrong, wrong","This book is wrong in almost everything it says, for example:In the trial of Mike and Lindy the jury SUPPOSE that Lindy lie when she said that she wanted to marry with Mike, but Nina proof that Mike made perjury in middle of the process, and all the jury were against Lindy because she is a liar.The jury waste three days to take a decision, and then happened a ""little"" problem and when the judge make another jury they have their decision in three hours.The worst of all the book, Paul, the boyfriend of Nina, he attacks her on the judgment, when the judgment ends, Paul investigates what happened with that ""little"" problem in the jury and he knows that if he does that Nina will lose everything she has, why he did that?At the end of the book, what happened to Mike and Lindy is pathetic, but that Nina still loves Paul even if he left her is more than pathetic."
3,Be aware,"I thought this was a beautiful dish set and ordered it, but was disappointed that the dark brown embossing was uneven, and sloppily painted in some places. Maybe I just got a defective set, but I was disappointed (which is rare with Target's products)."
1,STOP!! IT'S NOT AS DESCRIBED!!,"This product was a huge disappointment, and so was the entire transaction process with the shipper Home Decorators. The product is described by the selling company as ""hand fitted stained glass"" with ""bronze painted on base metal"". They are neither hand fitted, nor stained glass. The ""bronze"" is actually just brown, and there is nothing metal on the item at all. The hand painting is of very poor quality (a 6 year old could have done that) and the underside of the shade is an odd iridescent color, not painted like the top (even though is says stained glass, it's painted). Also, there are seams showing where the glass was poured. It took 2 months and about 20 emails to get my full refund. Expensive product--Buyer Beware!"
1,available in your local dumpster,"this book was horrible; i loved 'Emergence' but didn't really like the whole parrot thing in that book - this book expands on the idea and creates a whole new world where everything is as stupid as can be. it's quick (too quick), witty (trying too hard), and the ending is just plain dumb.i can understand why there's only one book in this 'trilogy', and thankfully it's out of print - be grateful!"
5,"this book is addictive, I want more!!!!","I enjoyed this book tremendously & I have searched in vain for the following volumes. It is very entertaining, witty & whimsical & I wish that the author had continued to write. He has the same greatness as the big name writers like Heinlein, Asimov,etc all have. He makes you laugh & he has a good imagination, Mr Palmer, if you read this,please finish the trilogy, thank you from a satisfied reader."
1,this is the Woooooorrrrssstt!!!!!,"i never saw somebody wanted to make best of from a huge Rhinoceros.TUBULAR BELLS,TUBULAR BELLS II and TUBULAR BELLS III are three different points of view - each of Bells has different music.TUBULAR BELLS I - 2 long pieces - 25 minutes each - very dark and meditativeTUBULAR BELLS II - more joyfull and new-age styled.many synthsTUBULAR BELLS III - electronic music with many interesting ideas.many styles mixed.Anyway - these compilation is propably made only to lower the budget hole in MIke's wallet.better buy all three parts of BElls separately instead of buying this NIGHTMAER...."
2,OK book,Its an ok book. If you really looking for specific treatments not the greatest book. You can do without this book unless you can purchase it for very cheap.
5,A must for any serious baseball card collector,"the 2005 edition of Beckett Almanac Of Baseball Cards And Collectibles, which even includes Canadian cards from 1912 to modern times - and coins, pins, stickers, team yearbooks and more. There are thousands of photos which lend to easy identification even in black and white, there are card grading tips and guides for beginners, and each section is introduced with a specific set of notes or collector's tips. Conclude with a glossary of hobby terms and series indexes and you have a top pick which represents a virtual 'bible' - and a must for any serious baseball card collector."

3,Great show....,"I love Farscape, so any review I do about them that has less than five stars hurts me. But I have to say, the double sided DVDs sometimes seem to freeze or skip. Not alot or I would have demanded a replacement, not that there are any, but double sided DVDs are just not the best way to get a show out to the public, even if it somehow makes them cheaper.On the other hand there were a lot more extras in the Starburst edition than the other DVDs and the other seasons are available to get NEW, not used, so I am looking forward to the other seasons. Too bad the first season is so hard to get and costs so much. More people would become Fans and spend more money on the DVDs."
4,nice,"durable, but just wish it was bigger. my son loves it and loves the idea of saving his money. however, wish it wa bigger and better if it was harder to get the money out, because my 4 year old can get the money out too easy."
3,Spiderman bank,"The bank was smaller than I expected, but that wasn't the seller's fault. I didn't pay attention to measurements."
3,Hmm,"While this was a great book, there were some editorial issues. The cover was used on previously published book. And Grayson, the main male character, was often described ambivalently. Sometimes it was hard to tell if he was Anglo-American or not. The author and the editors should have caught those mistakes before publication. And the author needs to make it clear what background Grayson derives from."
2,Misleading,"First the cover of this book is very misleading. It has the same cover as A TOUCH AWAY BY Lisa Riley. The story itself is just Ok. I found it somewhat boring. I kept looking for something that was going to reach out and grab me, engross me in the story. I finish the book becuase I started it. List makers please do not put this book on your list of interracial romances. This is not a interraical couple"
3,Not interracial love story,It was ok but the pacing is off and it is not an interracial love story. The cover will fool you because in the book Grayson is discovered as Earth coloring and that his first wife calls him a bougerouis black person.
5,THE most perfect cookbook of the brand new millenium,"to be brief: every one of these recipes that I have tried work. Camille Le Foll is some kind of a cooking SAINT. The book not at all incidentally is very beautiful and small. This is how to cook at home. Simple, delicious, no fancy pants but no compromise on quality and taste. Totally French, absolutely fresh."
5,good light,nice light/ easy to use/on another day i would have gotten a brighter lightbut this scares fewer fish away
1,Did Not Work,The flashlight does not turn on. It was dead on arrival. I am going to return it as soon as possible.
4,"Great horror, suspense, comedy","...all wrapped up in one. Liked this director's other movie, Triangle, and enjoyed this movie even more. As I am British person living in the US, I enjoyed the dry British humor even in dire situations. This really was a good horror movie, not too gory, but enough to make you wince. Best of all were the different characters and their interchanges and the realization that they were being hunted. Well worth the rental and highly recommended."
2,A tired slasher film theme updated to include Office Space humor,"Severance is an attempt to mesh the silliness of Office Space with the gruesome horror of a 70's slasher flick. Seven members of the Palisades Defence company are on a Eastern European tour. They stop off for a weekend of team-building at a luxury resort, but get lost and find themselves amidst a group of mad killers who enjoy picking them off, one-by-one, for no apparent reason than the fact that they are there. The attempts at dark humor are uneven, at best, and no rhythm of horror and humor ever develops. The characters don't develop either, and we're left hoping that the next kill will be the last, just so the movie will end."
2,"It's a little bit of ""Office"", ""Deliverance"" and ""Lords of War""","A multinational munitions company sends seven of their employees to Hungary for a team building exercise. The team's picked off by the locals in various, sundry ways.""Severance"" has elements of both horror and comedy, but doesn't quite succeed as either. If this was going to be a slasher film, the real violence should have started a lot sooner--halfway into the film is a little too late and the buildup for 45 minutes just wears you down. On the other hand, there are some fairly funny places in the film. Hilarious? Not really. From what others had told me, that's what I'd expected and was sorely disappointed only to have chuckled in a couple of places.I'd rent this one--on a cheap day. See if you like it, then buy it."
2,Bloody awful,"""Severance"" disappointed me. In my opinion, it is neither especially funny nor suspenseful. A 90-minute slasher movie should not take 45 minutes for the slashing to begin. The characters were two dimensional (uptight boss, stoner, brownnose, hot American) and the film did not make me care for any of them. The villains were forgettable and without a gimmick, and their backstory as either escaped loonies or soldiers who were experimented on was weak and unoriginal. If I had made this movie, I would have made the bad guys a group also on a team building exercise--only their exercise is to kill a bunch of people."
1,A failure,"This film could have been great as comedy-Horror, but failed on both accounts and just looked stupid."
4,Surprisingly entertaining (and graphic) indie,"SEVERANCE is a very nice surprise - an unpretentious but satisfying comedy-thriller that builds up a palpable sense of unease, before the killing starts. The first half-hour is dry British comedy, and very well done - you end up liking ALL of the characters, even the annoying ones. And suspense mounts, as you see these likeable characters moving deeper and deeper into danger. The horror, once it gets going, is brutal - and a little brutalizing to the viewer, as black comedy gives way to mostly humorless gore. This slasher second-half is not quite up to the first half of the movie, with its original blend of office-politics comedy and menace. But the survival-horror is undeniably gripping (if a little prolonged). Beautifully shot and acted, by a wonderful cast. Highly recommended."
3,"THERE'S NO SUCCESS WITHOUT ""u""","Those of us who have worked for major corporations are familiar with those infamous team building sessions where trust and teamwork are forcefed via silly games and phoney sentiment. That premise gets a novel workout in this bizaare ""horromedy"". Only the teambuilding takes a backseat when the team starts getting wastee by unknown assailants.SEVERANCE is above average compared to our torture and pseudovampire movie, but it is a little disappointing in its sudden slide from a comedy horror movie to a plain slasher who will survive movie. The movie's deft comic touches fade away by the end. Laura Harris and David Dyer stand out in the talented cast and the movie's use of WE'LL MEET AGAIN over the ending credits is a refreshing vacation from most of the horrible songs featured in most horror movies. All in all, SEVERANCE is worth a look."
3,Fun!,"This was an enjoyable film with good character development and well acted. It is a bit corny, but it had some good moments. The bad guys weren't really spooky, but being a somewhat dark comedy, I don't think it detracts from this movie. Worth renting if you enjoy 'we got to get out of this sticky situation' type movies."
4,Comedy and horror - well done,"I went into this expecting a generic/cliche slasher flick - group goes into the woods, stereotypical stoner, jock, hot chick, geeks, ahole boss, etc.It does that and then gives them their own somewhat bizarre and overdone personalities, such as the boss's attempt to be PC.Rarely does a movie successfully combine horror and comedy, there were definitely some tongue in cheek moments here. Maybe no side-splitting laughter to be found, but I'd say it was darkly twisted and I laughed several times throughout.I'd say it closely resembled 'Cabin in the Woods', if you enjoyed that movie, you might appreciate this one.If you're looking for gory torture/porn, look elsewhere. This has some gore to it, but it isnt Saw or Hostel. I'd say this movie conentrates more on the humor than the horror and does it well."
5,Read this review before you buy it!,"If you are a horror movie fan you need to watch this movie. In most horror movies ppl do dumb things that drive you crazy. For the most part, the ppl in this movie do the right thing. Of course because of the way horror movies work out, it never works for them. This movie is funny, but not overly so. It still takes what's going on pretty seriously, but you can tell the movie makers were having a good time with it. The acting is very good, and the movie moves forward at a great clip. All in all this is a great movie that deserves more recognition."
3,A good slasher with enough humor,"Again, this is not the British answer to any movie, certainly not Friday the 13th. It stands on its own. It is a slasher and thriller that has enough humor at just the right spots to keep you watching. I liked the beginning and tie in of the beginning later in the movie. Without the humor it would have been two or two and a half stars. The acting is good and the predictability is kept in check throughout. Yea, it is a dark comedy slasher, that about sums it up."
4,great gothic-doom debut,"If you are a fan of My Dying Bride you should check out this album. Wonderful string and woodwind compliment some classic and electric guitar work. Songs are well-written romantic doom and gloom - truly sad. The lead male singer has a unique voice which at times is gruff,but he can also sing clean and often does. The female singer is very good,sexy sounding in fact. (Although I'm not a big fan of Theater of Tragedy, Beseech uses similar male/female singing leads.)All in all an interesting,hypnotic,and well produced debut!"
3,It does what it should do.,Nothing spectacular... it feels a little cheap... but it works. The sound quality is equal to that of the Sony product I replaced. The sticker-label is peeling off after only a week.
1,Worse than Useless,"I decided to forego the whole ""millionaire"" thing and use my brainpower and Loral's system to take a trip to the moon. Here are the instructions:1. Find a mentor who has successfully built a space ship and flown to the moon; he's probably right next door, but if not, ask around until you find him/her.2. Build your own state-of-the-art rocket ship, with the help of your mentor of course.3. Fly to the moon.Why couldn't I have figured this out on my own sooner? STUPID me!!Now I can place this book in the loo where it belongs; only it ain't for readin' if you get my drift."
1,Waste of time and money....here's a better idea,"This book a total waste of time and money....if you truly want to get out of debt and create success...look at Dave Ramsey ""Total Money Makeover""...it is wonderful!!! I was $57,500.00 in debt, not counting the house and car...that amount was just credit cards!!!!! With Dave's 7 baby steps I am now, in 1 1/2 years down to 8,643.00 in debt and that will be gone by August....I have not had to sell anything, take on extra jobs, I just learned how to manage my money and make it work for me....Dave is funny and I promise that this is easy and it will make a difference in your life!!!! God Bless and good luck to all"
5,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book.Strenghts: The details are simple enough for anyone to follow. Its kind of a light bulb moment for me. Why track debt payoffs with my current paycheck, when I could be obtaining wealth and paying these debts off much more efficiently?!?! Simply thinking. Just needed someone to kick it in to gear and Loral does that quite well. I am now on my way to utilizing my skill set to create wealth and have even signed up for some of Loral's webseminars to keep focused. My husband has even joined in and we couldn't be happier! ([...])Weaknesses: I think the book writing could have been organized in a different manner. Its organized in a chunky-fasion. Not in a flowing presentation. Hard to expain, but in no way defers from the quality skills Loral presents.I have just starting reading her new book: Cash machine for life and it is awesome!This book and others of Loral's collection is definitely a great addition to my world of knowledge and book collection!"
3,Not a bad book for the price,"I'm one of the many people who ordered this book for free (just paid shipping & handling). I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing, but there are some good tips about starting to build wealth, such as 'paying yourself first' and working with a team of investors and professionals. I agree with some of the other contributors to this site who have expressed concerns about some of Loral's real estate investment techniques; I would just like to read a review from someone who has actually used the book to create wealth. Most of the reviews give a glowing recommendation but no real-world examples from their lives, and the others are lets say not enthusiastic about the capitalist economic model."
3,Great star bad end.,"The book gave a powerful introduction to the overview for a millionaire life. But lacked the nuts and bolts. For example, telling one to have 40% return is supremly different than showing where one might find such an investment."
2,very much lacking in specifics,"This book is more of a general overview rather than a step-by-step process on how to become wealthy. It has some good ideas but lacks any substantive specifics on how to accomplish them. I get the feeling the book is more of a marketing tool for the author's other products which, by the way, are extremely expensive. Caveat emptor."
3,Millionaire Maker,"Disappointing read - too much jargon used (Loral's copyrighted words for certain processes). Also, the assumption that anyone can start a small business and have it generating excess cash is a bit ""pie in the sky"". Small business is hard work and stats show how high the failure rate. Most average people would be better sticking to their job, thereofre being more eligible for a bank loan and getting rich a little slower using other people's money."
2,Sound great but almost useless,"General information that sounds really cool but with nothing practical about it. The outlined ""principles"" clearly didn't help the author make it financially, so she decided to write a book and get as much money as she could from the poor souls who went for her overpriced coaching. Loral is playing with people's hopes and rags-to-riches dreams. Thank God for the library, so I don't have to spend money on her useless books."
3,Not so new information.,"Interesting book with an interesting aproach of the subject, but not exactly so new information. Most of the topics covered are also covered in other books of the same subject. The language used is very direct and and easy to comprehend."
1,Disappointed,Just another book that talks around everything without giving clear objectives as far as the goals. very General and theoretical. Would Not recommend it and wish I had invested my money ito something other than making her a Millionaire.
1,"Scams, Suckers, and Who's Really Making Money","I heard the informercial on the radio and I really was excited. Based upon what was said, I felt that the $9.95 would be a worthwhile investment. Once I got on the phone, I was sucked into have the rest of her program sent (multiple payments of $69.97). The book was completely opposite from my expectations that were based on the informercial. Loral is primarily making her money by selling books and coaching session.My advice is to keep your money. In fact, buy $10 worth of lottery tickets would be a better investment (and we know that playing the lottery is for suckers).So if you want to learn how to make money in real estate, read Robert Allen's book."
1,Waste of money.,"The idea that everyone can just go out and purchase 10 rental properties for $45,000 each is absurd. Where is the author living in never land?"
1,Wishful Thinking,This book did not tell me anything that I nor anyonelse did not already know. First of all it takes money to make money. The author leaves contact information in the book and never responds as she says in the book. It is allot of hype and foolishness. Either you need money or credit and allot of luck and prayer. Never think or believe that you will be rich by hard work and sweat alone as stated you can by the author. One big sham!!!!
3,interesting but unreslistic for the masses,"I agree with about 90% of what she says, but most ""average"" people will have no clue as to how to put it together."
5,Think like the Wealthy!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THis is very good book for those who want to make money, get out of debt and organize their finances. I don't know whats up with the bad reviews because I am 23 and this book has already gotten me on the right path. Very good read for those who want organization with their money and want to make more money"
4,You call this writing,This book is disjointed and unorganized. The author clearly needs help in not using words before she explains what they mean. Hard to follow!
5,Good advice,Good read. I bought to help me get into real estate. Good prices and shipping makes Amazon a great place to shop.
4,The Millionaire Maker,"The book seems to be well organized and has a definite plan for helping you change your way of thinking. In some ways it is a little weak on specifics. Just when you are ready for the details of how she solves a problem, she leaves you with general answers and goes on to the next subject. This may be OK but it's a little frustrating. All-in-all, a worthwhile book."
3,Book should be free,"I like her ideas, but you really don't learn anything new if you have basic comman sense. This book is trying to get you hooked so that you can sign up for a $6,000 seminar. If the book is free, then it is worth it since it is bascially a commercial for the seminars"
2,suggest Reading Millionaire Mind instead,Book is so so. Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Ecker is much better in this category. I bought the book to go to her seminar. Same rating for the seminar
4,The A-Team,"It was an easy to read book, not only in the general vocabulary used, but also in overall content. The importance of working with a team of people who are experts in the fields that you need to be only familiar with was really driven home. I think that mayhave been the most important thing I got out of it. The only thing that may have been a draw back was the area that focused on creating your own business. I don't think there was necessarily enough explanation on this point."
1,This book has blank information.,"I would not give this book any stars, but the system makes you. The tables in this book telling you how to allocate your funds are all missing. Plus she doesn't talk to any normal people. Everyone one but the teacher has something like $500,000 in an IRA or 401K that she raids and used to buy real estate to create passive income to save the day. The plan she uses dosn't make sense either. There is no way that you can take money out of your IRA or 401K with out paying a penality that I know of.Also recommended: The Successful Investor by O'neal The 4 laws of debt free prosperity by Harris & Coonadt Beyond Positive Thinking by Anthony Your Pilot's License by Eichenberger Change Your Thinking Change Your Life by Tracy"
5,Timeless R&B at it's best!,"This album is a gem.....classic R&B sung by the master himself, Mr. Bobby Blue Bland. Do not let the release date of 1974 scare you...there is absolutely no ""disco"" sound only pure ""sung from the soul"" R&B with a fantastic back-up band. Each cut is unique to itself so that it never gets boring; each song is a timeless classic of love lost or of being down and out. When you're feeling blue this is the album to turn to!"
3,Not one of his best,"I was RAISED on Pigmeat Markham, as one of the generation of children in the 60s and 70 who sneaked to hear this while our parents weren't home (this stuff was once considered raunchy although Mr. Dewey markham rarely used any profanity on record). Unfortnately, these are later, weaker routines for the most part. Not nearly as funny as his classic Chess recordings (Pigmeat at the Party, Anything Goes With Pigmeat, Mr. Vaudeville, The Wolrd's Greatest Clown, and Here Comes the Judge, etc). If you want good Pigmeat, seek those out and leave this alone."
5,Vintage Pigmeat,"I've been a huge Pigmeat Markham fan since the Warped tour. He is the future of rap music. Look at him on the cover of this album, no I said look at him!! He has that Usher look that will drive the ladies of hip hop crazy. Obviously, you start and end this thing with the title track. ""Crap shootin rev"" is 2005's ""Yeah"". It will probably win several grammys and you'll see a Beyonce-Pigmeat duet at next year's awards show. Carson Daly is afraid to have Pigmeat on TRL because he's afraid of the controversy. Pigmeat is the black M&M. His video for crap shootin rev would easily be #1 on TRL if Carson would let it on the countdown. Carson just has a problem with Pigmeat due to the whole Puffy thing. Pigmeat Markham will not be denied though. Look for Crap Shootin Rev to top the album chart in the next couple of months. It's that good."
1,For Lupica Family members only,"Dont' read this book if you want a recap of the 98 baseball season. Do read it if you want to know more about Mike Lupica's kids, their favorite player, the name of their little league team, and the rules at the Lupica house for the boys bedtime.If you are related to Mike Lupica or are a friend of the family, by all means buy the book, you'll love it, since most of it is about people you know. For the rest of us, who bought it thinking we were getting the story of the 98 season, it is a waste of money."
4,Almost Great,"An entertaining month-by-month account of the many reasons why 1998 was such a memorable baseball season, including the stories behind the stories. Unfortunately, the book is marred by the author's penchant for name-dropping. The common fan who spends a week's pay to take his kids to a game will have trouble relating to the the privileged Lupica clan as they stroll through Yankeee stadium with Buck Showalter, share intimate conversations with baseball legends old and new, and receive gifts of personally autographed bats on their birthdays. Not to mention great seats for all those games. Sure, we're just jealous, Mike, but rubbing our noses in it shows a lack of class."
1,yikes,"I recall the summer of 98 fondly. Unfortunately this book didn't contribute to it at all. This is easily the poorest writing I've ever had the mispleasure of reading. Furthermore, the author was never able to arrest my attention and really allow me to relive the moments. It just fell short in every way."
4,Good book savoring the '98 season,"Overall, I thought this was a very good book. Lupica tries a little too hard to find ""coincidences"" and ""reasons"" for everything but other than that it is very well written. It gives the '98 season from many different perspectives."
4,Memories Forever! Great Reading,"Outstanding book for all ages, especially for father & sons. My dad & I in the 50's & 60's followed the game in this manner and me & my boys did the same in the 70's, 80's & 90's. There are many memories to relive, not only from the greatest year yet, 1998, but also many years of growing up & listening to games on the radio, imagining I was there, then going outside and ""pitching a game"", throwing against our fireplace bricks, Ralph Terry or Whitey Ford winning another. Memories, Memories, Memories!!"
1,Ugh!,"I was really looking forward to this book. I am a great Yankee fan and wanted to be able to relive the '98 season. I happened to be in a bookstore (just browsing, of course)and began reading a copy. On page 19, I found a glaring error: Lupica reports that the Cardinals have won 7 World series when most fans know they have won 9. Finding this type of mistake so early in the book makes me wonder how many more like it, that I will not recognize, there are and really ruins the experience for me."
2,Don't waste your time or money,Johnson is just too crass. I've liked some of her books before but not this story! I did like Ms Winston's story and the others were so-so.
1,Very disappointing,"Why did I bother buying this book? . I didn't like Susan Johnson's A Tempting Wager at all. The back cover said that the story was about 4 bored debutantes. Hardly debutantes when Georgie (heroine) was married for 7 years and Emilie was Tallyrand's mistress. I only bought the book as I had thoroughly enjoyed Susan Johnson's Playing with Fire in the Rough Around the Edges anthology. This was only the second SJ story I had read, and if her other stories are as crude and badly written as A Tempting Wager, then I don't think I will bother with anymore. I was so disappointed with A Tempting Wager that I couldn't bring myself to read the other 3 stories in the anthology. I will have to save them for a rainy day."
2,Great cover,The cover was the only thing interesting about this book. Each of these stories were so unbelievable. Susan Johnson's A tempting wager was the worst. The others were a little better. However the The Maine Attraction was best of all four stories. If you are in the mood to read some very silly stories. Then this book is for you.
5,Nice!,"These are a nice set of extra headphones to have around the house. I paid a dollar for them. Nothing fancy, but nice to have on hand."
3,A classic Leo Kottke recording.,"This is an important recording as Leo Kottke was starting to sing more than he had in the past. I appreciate the variety as the album is not 100% instrumentals and I personally like the honest no-frills vocals. Add to that T-Bone Burnett's productions skills and you have a pretty good recording. However, I prefer My Father's Face, a later recording again produced by T-Bone Burnett"
3,Please explain,"I just this moment finished reading ""Invisible Man"", and though I sense I've missed a lot of its meaning, I wonder what all of the fuss is about. I was tripped up by Ellison's ambiguity, only occasionally interrupted by flashes of understanding, though this may be my fault and not the book's. However, I feel it is not entirely accurate in its portrayal of the Communist cynicism, among other bits. I have one vital question concerning the story, which none of those I have talked to thus far have been able to explain to me, and which I would appreciate an answer posted here to: why is he invisible?"
5,Invisible Man must be in High School English courses,"I did this book with 11th graders and it was a blast. It is a great book for any English course, but especially powerful for American Lit. classes. I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X concurrently and it is a great parallel. I suggest reading both Malcolm X and Invisible Man at the same time----you are able to get more out of both intriguing novels."
5,Certainly one of the ten best 20th-century American novels..,"INVISIBLE MAN is a Bildungsroman, hilariously recounting the missteps of a black boy trying to make his way in the black and white worlds, neither of which he understands. The novel conludes ambivalently with the expressed idea that ""the world is possibility,"" but denies this dramatically when the hero is literally forced underground, in a subterranean hole illuminated by thousands of light bulbs, representing his disillusionment. Up to this point, this young black Candide has made every misjudgment possible, being used by everyone he comes in contact with, including the Communist Party (here called ""The Brotherhood.""} Both American history and American race relations are seen through a sophisticated prism through the microcosm of the novel.The work is beautifully structured and styled. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Poor guy. . .,"First off, I had to read this book for school. Usually I don't like ""Classics"" and destest reading them, even though I love reading in general. This book was ok. The themes of race/class division and the duplicity of the human race were valid and sometimes interesting, but the book just annoyed me. At times it bored me, but mostly annoyed me. Why is this young nameless man so naive! He gets kicked down, abused and injured in so many t bizarre surreal ways it's amazing he hasn't died off due to natural selection! Ellison also adds so many interesting events that he just doesn't follow up on, we HAVE to read about this guy! I think he learns some things in the end, but as this is, I think, an optomistic book in general I predict he'll still get stomped on."
4,lightining,"I've only read a couple of novels in my life where I could feel the author's intensity, like he was on fire with the muse when he wrote it. One was a portion of The Idiot by Dostoevsky, the other was this novel.It can't be sustained.The novel falls off after the first half, but how can you sustain perfection?"
2,Didn't deserve the praise it received,"I hate to be so crude about my opinion of the book, but it was awful. First of all, I had to read this book for school, and though this may have biased my opinion slightly, I just plain found it dull. It had a wonderful beginning, which made me excited to continue, but after that it rambled to the point of dullness. He would go on and on for chapters describing meaningless things making it very difficult to pick up the novel to keep reading. The epilogue was one giant jumble to me. I couldn't understand the language at times, and the theme he was trying to drive home could have easily been described in a few short paragraphs. The central theme is essential, and it is a milestone in African-American literature, but it is a very boring milestone at that."
3,High School reading..,We just needed this book for a high school reading assignment and wanted it cheap. So the book was in good condition and met our needs.
3,Invisible Man,"This is an important book in the sense it sheds light on the trials and tribulations of an educated black man in the mid 1900s. Not my favorite piece of literature, but it was well worth my time and was easy to read."
3,I wouldn't exactly call it the best novel in the 20th cent,"I chose this novel to read for English. It was not the kind of book that I couldn't put down, but I was able to stick with the story. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was nothing exciting or revolutionary about what he decided to do with the rest of his ""invisible"" life. The worst part of the book is the 10 page report I'm being forced to do that deals with the aspects of racism in the novel. If anyone has any ideas or helpful points about racism in the novel, please email me."
2,"Dated, Rambling, & Slow",This could be a good book if it was condensed. This is something I would seldom recommend yet in this book I think it is a must. The reason is that the story keeps getting side tracked with lengthy preaching and oratory that does more to turn me off than to inform me.
3,An almost complete marvel,"Joe Morton's rendition of Ellison's Invisible Man is gripping, indeed totally involving. This is a very important novel, one that is brought full circle in its last chapter and epilogue. Those who only listen to the tape, therefore hear an unabridged but incomplete performance. Most disappointingly, it is missing the last chapter and the epilogue. This is particularly disappointng as many, if not most, who read this book for the first time do so because it is assigned in high school; a good number of those would benefit from listening, as often such a long book is beyond their capacity in a limited time frame."
1,The Most Boring Book in the World!!!!!!!!!,"The Invisible Man is the first book that I read in which every word was boring and pointless. I understood what it was about, however I felt it was pointless. The prologue was even boring! All in all you can read this book and be the judge of it yourself but prepared to be bored out of your mind unless you enjoy reading about how a african american is betrayed over and over again."
1,eww,"BAD BAD BOOK. Noble goals, but just bad. And the ending, which envolves a coal mine, is stupid. NEVER read this book."
1,Invisible Man is a waste of time!!,Invisible man by ralph ellison gave me the worst agony of any book i've ever had to read in school. it has absolutely NO plot and it is totally biased. i hated it- and if your under the age of 65 you will too.
1,b.s.,"Let me start off by saying I am not impressed by this book. And dats all I gots ta say bout dat. yassah. If ever there was a book that should be banned, I think this might be one; Catcher in the Rye was so much better. Oprah might like it doh."
2,Over-hyped,"Long-winded and boring. Those who admire style over substance may enjoy this novel. Ellison reminds me a little of Joyce, i.e., the writing, prose and style are inventive and, at times, beautiful. However, unlike Joyce, the story goes nowhere and any revelations seem naive. Though the story was/is hailed by many as brilliant, the narrative seems flat and Ellison's characters are mostly realized as overly-broad caricatures. In the end, the novel's premise is fundamentally flawed as Ellison seems unable to distinguish between racism, hatred/distrust of the poor and institutional (religious, corporate, governmental, etc.) oppression. Though they may look and feel the same, they are not."
3,Doesn't deliver.,"A novel with great aspirations that, at times, truly captures the reader. Far too frequently, however, Ellison rambles and lets go of the powerful hold he spends so much time developing.I was constantly annoyed by how easily the protagonist allowed himself to be played the fool. Again and again he proved to be not much more than a follower of bad ideas who, when finally forced to open his eyes, does not accept personal responsibility, but rather hides in his poor, invisible cover.As a look at the black struggle in society, IM is startling. As a tale of a Man's struggle against society, it is feeble in comparison to such untouchable works as Hesse's 'Steppenwolf' and Ellison's own partial inspiration, Dostoyevsky's 'Underground Man'."
2,Invisible Man,"I purchased this book because I understand that President Obama read it many, many times. I thought I would try to find out why he read this book so often. Well, I read about 25 percent of the book and could not continue any further. It is racial and not inspiring in terms of all of us getting along! I am looking for something more rewarding."
4,The Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison,"This book is amazing hands down. I love the ideas of invisibilty, blindness, and oppression. However, the seller did not state that they wrote into the book and the prolog was written on. Also some other pages had foot notes inserted by the previous reader. All in all, after looking over those minor problems, good book."
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!,"An inspiring reading from Joe Morton. I had read the book, however when I listened to this audio version during a long road-trip I felt as if I had discovered the work anew. Joe Morton's performance is wonderful beyond words.I have listened to a lot of audiobooks, but this is my favorite!"
4,Invisible Man,"A LITTLE too long and a little out of date, but still a must read for the younger readers to understand what it was like for the blacks in the 50's and beyond."
3,a book whose reputation outstrips it's merit,"I am an invisible man. ... I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.... When they approach me they see only surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination--indeed, everything and anything except me.So begins Ralph Ellison's wildly uneven, overlong, emotionally excessive & oft-times hysterical, 1953 National Book Award Winner, Invisible Man--a book that's desperately in search of an editor.From it's opening scene at a Battle Royale, where young black men fight until only one is left standing, to it's closing scene in a Harlem riot, Ellison is always going over the top. As one can see from Irving Howe's 1952 review the book's shortcomings have been obvious since it was first published, but that same review makes clear the struggle of the white establishment to treat it honestly. The result is, I think, a book whose reputation outstrips it's merit.GRADE: C"
5,Invisible Man peers into mankind's struggle for Identity,This story will live on forever. Its fundamentals express that of all human kind. Ellison explains how we all search for who we truly are in life. You can see how other individuals make such a great impact on your life. The protagonist captures your intrigue throughout his exploration of life. This novel is not to be overlooked.
4,It's good...but slow,"The book was well written, it had a lot of confusing flashbacks, and at times got irratating because it was so slow. But overall it was an excellent book, really one of those better ""it helps you figure out who you are"" books. Makes you think."
3,What I think of Invisible Man,Although this book is excelently written it never stopped irritating me. I just could never get over the fact that the main character showed such leadership skills and such potential to make a difference but never seemed to quite live up to the potential he had
4,School,My senior daughter had to have this book for class. Of course I found this out the day she was supposed to start reading it. Great service and shipping time.
4,Thought-provoking; loses the reader at times,"This book is deep. At times so deep that I had no idea what Ellison was talking about. However, hidden amongst the pages and pages of the nameless main character's thoughts, are thought-provoking passages that make reading all six hundred pages of ""Invisible Man"" worthwhile. While I felt that this book was unnecessarily slow, I was never very anxious to reach the end. This book makes you crave resolution; and when you don't find in the final pages of the novel, you look for it in life."
3,A good book to read,I thought that this book reall concntrated on the way the narrator felt about is role in th world and how he actually made it through and learned so much about himself. From the different settings of the story yoou can see what he learned from each place. He also compared the things He saw in new York to the new things he learned from where he came from down South. Often through this story he called himself Invisible and soon realizd that it wasn't true and that he merely had to find himself in the midst of his troubles. The book was good if you like to read about the way things were before you were born.
4,"Good Book, Well Worth Reading, But...","Good Book, well worth reading, but it's too long.The story is good, moving and helpful to understand the powers and forces at work on Black men and all disenfranchised people of the early 20th century, but it is too long. Too much discription and detail that sometimes get in the way of a moving, well told story.For the modern reader, the story that is told in 580 pages would best be told in 350 to 45O pages. Having said that, it is important to remember that this book might well be considered an example of the writing style of the early 50s. If that thought is a consideration, this criticism would be unfounded and lack validity.Wade your way through the Introduction and early stuff and get right to the story, Chapter One. It is quite good, quite moving and at times, quite sad and alarming. It offers new depth and insight into the Black experience and perspective."
2,Iwas assigned this book and most books get better b,"When I started it was because I was bored. I then had to read it and it just so hard for me to keep reading.I love to read, but this book was dull it was like never ending.I wouldn't recommened it."
3,not my type,"though this is considered a great american novel, it was not everything i had hoped for it., i would not have read this book if it wasnt for my senior english ap class"
1,Disappointment,"I read The Invisible Man thirty years ago and thought it was excellent. This time, however, I've been disappointed. The prologue is very fine, after that, however, Ellison pushes his situations to such an extreme that they strain credibility, become ridiculous, almost comic. The descriptions of several situations seem almost adolescent."
