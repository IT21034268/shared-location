5,Excellent Relaxing Music.,"Earth Rhythms is great for realxing just about any situation. Whether you use it to fall asleep for a nap or to soothe a screaming baby, it works."
5,Love Story,"The Magic of Ordinary Days is a wonderful family story that incorporates a little WWII era history as well. Skeet Ulrich and Mare Winningham lend their superb acting to this love story, and Keri Russell is very believable too. I have watched this movie multiple times and recommend it highly to anyone who likes G Rated love stories. It exemplifies the quality we have come to associate with Hallmark."
5,best of Mariah Carey,This is probably the best performance ever of Mariah Carey. If you're really fun of Mariah buy it you will not regret it.
5,Mr. Tickle does more than make you laugh unwillingly....,"Mr. Tickle makes you laugh WILLINGLY.I know, I know. You are saying, ""But I don't like to be tickled. And I don't want my children to feel that tickling is socially appropriate.""I had similar reservations before approaching Mr. Tickle, but I ordered it anyway. Mr. Tickle gets his just rewards, let me assure you, but in the meantime, he seduces readers into the world of Mr. Men. He does not just Tickle the people in his town. No, that is more...Sesame Street (The Tickler, The Man Who Starts with the Letter T, Volume 13, I think, of The Sesame Street Library).Mr. Tickle helps the people of his town BOND TOGETHER. He is that slippery sort of antagonist who acts as a protagonist. Britain called for a hero, and Mr. Tickle answered the phone."
5,Very cute,"I remember reading this book a long time ago, and I loved it. I still do. Mr. Tickle has always been my favorite Mr. Men character because he liked to have fun by tickling people. In an episode of the Mr. Men and Little Miss show, Mr. Small got stuck in a tree, and Mr. Tickle used his long arms to get Mr. Small down. That shows that even Mr. Tickle knows there's a time to be silly and a time to be serious. I'd recommend this book to kids, because it's wholesome, something that a lot of books today aren't."
4,Patience,This is a great book for young children to learn how to count in Spanish and English. The rich colors used for the illustrations connect the words with the pictures. I enjoyed the style of the artwork from the illustrator from page to page.
4,The Detective Chapman!,I've enjoyed these Roger the Chapman mysteries that take place in the 1400s. This particular story took a while to get started as there were so many family connections and it was hard to remember how all these people were related. Still it was yet another clever plot with an original ending that only Roger could figure out. The background of those times are also interesting and there is a lot of historical facts interwoven in the stories. I was delighted to find this book in the local library since I've had problems trying to locate all the books of this author. I look forward to reading more!
5,I grew up with this!,"When I was about, oh, nine years old, my Mom got me this album. I lived in Maryland then, only actually 15 minutes away from Barry's house. He performed once at the local mall, and I got to meet him.I love this album still, and I am 34. I gave my sister the album when she had her first child, so I am going to buy the CD. Barry Louis Polisar will live on in this house!"
1,What a waste of money,"I have a Looney Tunes album from when I was a kid that my kids and their friends find hilarious. Naughty songs is neither funny or enjoyable. I have a great sense of humor and enjoy silly stuff and ""bathroom humor"", but this is just horrible to listen to."
5,worth it for the Rosanne Cash essay,"brilliant writing by a brilliant under-appreciated artist/writer/ songwriter who transcends the limits of many genres, boundaries, expectations"
5,A series which hand-picks the year's best music writing,"Da Capo Best Music Writing 2002 is the third volume in a series which hand-picks the year's best writing about music, covering all genres and providing a host of literary articles reflecting on music's personalities, evolution, and content. From a survey of the underground New Orleans rap scene from an insider's stand to a composer of haiku for Eminem and details on Bob Dylan and Louie Armstrong, Da Capo Best Music Writing 2002 holds something for everyone."
3,Not as pictured.,"I did not like this ring. The silver was very light weight and instead of what appeared to me to be caviar beading on the gallery as shown in the picture, there was a cut out pattern. The onyx was very dull. Maybe there should be more photos of the ring from different angles so that the potential buyer gets a better idea of the ring's design. That being said, the ring is pretty. It was just not what I was looking for or expected. However, the seller was great. I received the ring quickly and the return was painless."
3,Textbook came in ahead of time,"The textbook came in earlier than expected...a plus; however, when the description said it would be practically new, ripped or torn covers don't constitute the description, ""practically new"". Good on the pages in the book but be honest with your descriptions next time."
3,German Songbook,"This paperback has around 35 classic well-known songs, arranged for piano/vocal. The music has not been dumbed down as it is in many compilations. Almost all the songs are exclusively in German, only a few have English translations. It has all the verses of each song, often times more verses than you normally find. I have had my first copy for nearly fifteen years, and I have turned to it again and again."
1,The product does not match the photo,I am sure this product is fine but beware the picture does not match the product. This is a hydraulic pressure switch not a cable switch. It is not worth my time and cost to return this product as the shipping cost is the same as the part. The seller needs to correct the picture!
3,Wrestling's Secrets Exposed,"A ""serious"" video for wrestling fans, so the hype is still present. I liked this video, in spite of it unfortunately starting with 7 minutes of advertising. Along with showbiz secrets it shows how the wrestlers receive the techniques used in the ring, without injury. Very useful for serious jujutsu and aikido practitioners who will recognize many of these techniques and the risks they pose, whilst seeing how other people handle them. A few techniques such as ""Atomic Drop"" were missing but they may have been trying to walk the line between exposure and ""Kids, don't try this at home"". Not quite variable enough for a good teaching video but still useful.At this price other martial artists should have a copy in their library. They will provide a more appreciative audience than the majority of wrestling fans for whom this would be a tame video."
1,Too little too late,"Like the title saids:too little too late. We already know about the secrets like the blade,the tables and the legdrop. Vince McMahon told us the secrets back in the 1980's. As the Nostalgia Critic would say: ""That was entirely pointless!"" We also already know about how the moves are done,the fake punches and the piledriver. Overall,We already know,so why brother buying this? I give this tape a 1 out of 10."
4,Pretty good soft-core jiggle flick.,"The premise to the story (if you care) is that a group of girls set out to save a failing jeep tour business by acting as bikini-clad tour guides. The bikinis naturally come off on the tours and the customers line up. The story is occasionally entertaining, but the ladies are very attractive. Some of the ladies are natural and some are enhanced, and there is a fair amount of nude scenes. If you like pretty girls running around topless, this is a good pick."
1,2 broken and no email response,2 of the 4 wind chimes were broken and still awaiting response to my email.Fabulous Chinese Bamboo Wind Chime and Mobile
2,chimes for rosies,"the chimes were falling apart , as soon as I unpacked them,Thhey were not made to keep them together and secure"
4,"Quick witted, Funny, Honest Look at Life in New York","Of course truth is stranger than fiction and with Tuff it's hard to distinguish between the two. The story is outlandish enough to be true with Winston waking up from a shoot out thankful to still be alive with no wounds and a new gun to boot. Walking in Winston's shoes, traipsing the streets of Brooklyn, Harlem and everything in between--He's an overweight lover, husband and father looking to survive the dense hole called life. By the end of the book I was just glad I made it out alive."
3,"Funny, but...","Like his ""White boy shuffle"", this book is hilarious and has several areas where it would be hard not to bust out laughing... However, like with WBS, there isnt much of a storyline to follow... its more like little funny slices or ghetto life.The ending leaves you feeling unfulfilled... like.. ""You mean, this is how it ends? So, what happened? ""Not sure Id recommend this book to anyone... Unless I knew they had a seriously warped sense of humor."
4,A Great Character in Somewhat Disjointed Settings,"Winston Foshay - Tuffy - is one of the most memorable characters I have encountered in fiction in the last few years. His language, his relationships, his reasoning, and his taste in film worked for me separately and together. The surrounding characters in Tuff fall into the 'interesting, but not quite deep enough' camp for me, certainly enough description for their supporting roles, but none of them strong enough to be the Tuffy's foil or an authentic sounding board for his reflections. The settings seemed a bit confusing. While entertaining a sumo exhibition lends very little to the plot and only a little to Winston. Overall though, an enjoyable book that I would recommend."
3,Time traveling electricians meet spider-cannibals!,"A team of electricians investigate a deserted Chicago building and find an empty laboratory, which holds a seemingly broken nuclear reactor. But when the core is suddenly activated, our heroes enter an alternate universe. There they encounter a bizarre race of cannibalistic spider-people. Originally aired on the Sci-Fi Channel, stars Richard Grieco and Kate Greenhouse"
3,Not Bad......,"Great start, good ideas...well directed...but how long can the qualitylast...depending on the budget... As the movie goes along, it staysafloat but barely... Why, cause its has the capability of becomminga great movie, but due to lack of budget (in most cases) we end up witha good movie...that could have been great. Most of the acting is passable, and we also have a actor that the camera loves a lot and iscontinously getting playgirl angles on his face....too bad...brought themovie down a knotch, but overall love the portal effects...good actingon the scientist part.A watchable movie...may keep it"
3,AND THE PROBLEM WAS?,"AND THE PROBLEM WAS? Four electricians are transported to a parallel world while attempting to shut down an old project in a deserted building. This other world is filled with cannibalistic spider-humans, but on the up side we learn it has no tattoo parlors. Rather than deal with all the positive aspects of the world (no greasy bikers) they decide they need to destroy the spider queen and escape this world. The movie starts out with promise. The spider people have that ""zombie"" feel to them. This movie was not a career builder for any of the ""actors"" in it. Horror, violence. No nudity or F-bombs."
5,Multiplication ROCKS!,"I love Schoolhouse Rocky as much as anyone, but I am feeling a little ambiguous about this CD. I purchased it for my daughter to help her with her multiplication, and wouldn't you know it? She took the CD sleeve to school for a test and got caught cheating. Now I don't know if that was because the songs on this CD aren't as catchy to my daughter as they are to me, or if my daughter was simply being lazy. Either way, Multiplication Rock hits its intended target."
1,Not what it seems,I was so unbelievably dissapointed. This item is actually about 1 inch by 2 inch. The picture is very misleading.I would not buy from this company again
5,Maika'i,"Inspiring. Talks not only to the story of the great person Eddie was, but to what he means to Hawaii and the pride of their culture and roots."
5,A beautiful story,"What a legend. I loved the book, it's so well narrated and full of aloha. It tells the long journey of a simple human who reunited tremendous values like courage, determination, friendship, sacrifice and love, to finally find eternal rest at sea. Everyone should read this book to learn about how to be better in life."
1,Scott does not know it all !,"I have spoken to Mr.Coleman and he admitted to me, Butch's sister, that he did not verify his scorce(s) when he wrote Butch VanArtsdalen was the son of alcholic parents. This is a slanderous lie, and if our parents were still alive I would sue Mr. Coleman for it. If Scott would do this to the VanArtsdalen family,I can only wonder how much of the book is actually true.Also, I do not see why he chose to attack Butch, since the book is about Eddie Aikau!Shame on you Scott & Stick to your subject!Sincerely & Always Butch's Sis"
4,grace,"Grace is certainly a strickingly different album to Times of grace, not 'heavy' no vocals. the album does not really revolve around the traditional band setting but is better described as a montage of sounds. This does not make Grace a bad album however, it is an intruiging concept and a fascinating listen. I would reccommend it to anyone regardless of musical taste for the sheer 'art' of it."
2,Too much hassle,"After spending $180, I'm terribly disappointed. When I first tried these the fit was so fickle and shifty I got disgusted and put them in a drawer. After a year or so I decided to give it a go again with new ear foams. They fit great, but don't you dare try to move a muscle and god help you if you run or workout. To make matters worse, the cord is so heavy and long that it literally yanks the earbuds out of your ear....ugh!!!!!!!!!!! I have no problem with the sound, but the tolerances needed to get that sound require you to fiddle for a few minutes then remain motionless. I wouldn't mind if I was paying $50...but I paid a lot more."
2,shure e3,I recently purchased this product from Amazon after an extensive research. I also bought creative zen vision M mp3 player. I have tested Shure E3 many times comparing with Creative's earphone. I was very surprised with the result so that I wanted to give it one more chance by testing it with my friend's latest Ipod. But the result was the same. I'm very disappointed that E3 lacked low frequencies. No bass at all. But highs and mids are very detailed. Listening music through Creative bundled earphone was much much more pleasant.
5,"The main photo is wrong: the earbuds are WHITE, not gray.","The Shure e3c consumer model earbuds are white, as are shown on the ""see more pictures"" page. The default photo displayed in the ad does not match the model being sold. The gray earbuds are the Shure e3 earbuds (older model). I hope that the Amazon web team will correct this photo error so that its customers will not be led astray by this mistake (and then have to return the product later on)."
5,Simply the best so far.,"My iPod sounds like a totally different device altogether. There's no loss with the in ear E3. The first 3-4 days it didn't sound that great but once I got the yellow foams, WOW!Got these for $135 at MicrophoneSolutions.com (Coupon Code F135E3200). Simply the best addition to my iPod!"
4,"Good product, but a little expensive?","So, I have to say from reading forums/reviews across the internet, these truly are great headphones if you can manage the right fit. ONe important thing to note however, is that by and large people are going to try and overcharge for them. Froogle.com was very useful in helping me understand this, and most importantly, it helped me find noonshopper.com, where they have these E3Cs for $127 and 7.50 shipping!!! Unbeatable!!!"
2,Too fragile,"It's a good thing the warranty on this item is so good because I am now returning the headphones for the second time. The stem is too fragile and it breaks easily. Sound is great, but certainly not when I can only use one ear and have to keep returning!"
3,Not what I was looking for,"I think my application for them was not what these were really meant for. They really lacked in the bass department. Everything else played well through them, but just not what I was looking for. I went back to my Creative Labs and those things produce great bass."
5,This is a MUST-HAVE CD!,"The Road Less Traveled leads off a strong album that never looks back. This is a refreshingly different, great CD. Buy it."
5,Bill Parsons is THE PANTZ,Special Delivery is a great cd full of songs with a meaning. The Road Less Traveled is excelent as well as St. Fred and Silver Shinings. They are interesting and great. A must try....
5,Grandma's Sweater,"I really enjoyed this delightful book. Mary Aquino has a way of of bringing her characters to life. You think that you have the pattern down, and then the book takes a few twists and turns that you would never expect. I am looking forward to reading other books written by Mary Aquino."
4,"Granny and Red are Delicious - a review of ""Red Riding Hood""","We liked this book but I don't think we'd give it 5 Stars. Five Stars should mean a knock-you-socks off book. This is nice, but rather typical of Marshall, and more or less what you see with most Red Riding Hood stories.Which is not to say that there isn't humor nor merit in the book. I love that Granny gets cranky at being interrupted while reading in bed (she has a stack of books by the bed), and that in one picture there is an empty box of after dinner mints laying open on the floor. [Granny in fact comments that it was so dark in the wolf's stomach that she couldn't see to read.]Four Stars. [B-]. Good Read-aloud. Marshall's usual clever artwork. Story follows the older versions in that grandma and Red are swallowed."
4,good but reader beware!,"I did like this book, but I gave it 4 stars mostly to draw attention that this book might not be for everyone. My children (ages 4 and 6) were definitely a bit disconcerted when the sweet granny got eaten up. Certainly not what they (nor I) was expecting! Of course, it all gets happily resolved in the end - but I had my reservations getting through the book myself. So if you have especially tender-hearted young'uns in the audience, you may want to go for the ""sanitized"" versions of this classic."
5,Fun and Cute,"This book is too funny. As a kid I was always read the ""nice"" version of this story - where the three little pigs all run to eachother's houses and escape the wolf. Well, not so much in this one! They get eaten! And then the wolf gets his just desserts LOL"
3,This is the Weathertech Cargo Liner for the Land Rover LR3 2005+,"I don't own this yet, just wanted to get this info onto the page for other users. This is the Weathertech Cargo Liner for the Land Rover LR3 2005+"
1,This book is not an effective guide to teenagers.,"This book not only will not help you with your teenager, it could very well make your life a living hell. It talks a lot about how to play mind games with them and talks nothing about the trust building and responsibility training that is necessary to work with any child. Example: If your child chooses not to take a shower or put on deoderant, this book suggests dousing them with the grossest smelling perfume that you can find. This not only shows complete disrespect for your child but it teaches the NOTHING except cruelty. If you need help a better book would be - ""Uncommen Sense."" It is an excellent book and gives you great advice."
3,"Great colors, shoddy paper","I love the soft, pretty, unique colors of these pads for making lists and taking notes around my office, but the paper is really cheap and feathery in texture. Anything but the cheapest ballpoint ink bleeds like crazy on it, and since I use a fountain pen that's a problem! I need to write with larger than normal letters to make sure the ink doesn't bleed so much that I can't read my writing. So pretty though!"
2,How old was this product??,"Well, it is a note pad, but it looks like it has been sitting in a window for 5 years. The nice colors were all faded to the same shade of blue/grey with only a bright binding to show how it used to look. Office staff asked for nicer colors so we ordered these, but nothing could be more depressing and washed out looking. It is not worth the cost to ship it back, plus we need note pads to write on, so we will just have to make due; however, they look terrible."
5,Very Well Written...,"This book is the best cultural history of horses and humans from earliest times to the present that I am aware of. I especially liked the passages on horse racing and horse games around the world, from the Scythians to the Sioux and from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the quarter horse races of the Old West. The author makes connections between ancient and modern races, and describes race courses, audiences, and horse breeding techniques around the world over thousands of years. I had no idea that so many cultures played on horseback, from the tournaments of medieval knights and the polo of India's Moguls to the pato of the gauchos in Argentina and the chicken fight of the Navajo. This is both great fun and food for thought!"
5,fascinating and magical,"This is no straight history of the relationship between mankind and horses. Chamberlin somehow manages to convey the horse spirit in terms both mundane and mythological. One feels the muscled power of the beast, and can both see and hear a breath expelled from velvet nostrils on a cold rural morning. I picked this up in idle curiosity and was smitten with Big Bird. Could not stop turning the pages. I now ""get it"" - what all those horse lovers are about. Very cool book."
2,No vale la pena,"Es un churo monuemtalque comparada con la calidad de peliculas que se hacien en esos tiempos en Mexico, daba la apariencia de ser algo poco mas digno. Por lo menos se puede hablar aqui de mala actuación siendo que en otras peliculas ni actuación habia. Recomendable si se quiere perder 2 hras en hacer nada o como ejercisio de resitencia mental"
2,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,i had expected funny comedians since its a paul rodriguez presentation but i was disapointed. would not recommend it to anybody
2,Disappointing,"I'm not above a little mindless chick lit, and in fact have read dozens of Red Dress Ink books, but this one just isn't very good. There are typos, and the writing style leaves much to be desired. I also feel that the ""friendship"" between Lizzie and Clare feels off. There's all this underlying tension and in their relationship; even before Clare gets mad at Lizzie for her actions, they don't relate to each other the way real best friends do. I also find Matt to be completely unlikeable. I have to admit: I'm no quite finished with the book, but I am not too impressed so far."
5,Great Addition to Red Dress Line Of Books,"Without a doubt - one of my newest favs is ""Name & Address Withheld"" by Jane Sigaloff. I found this latest Red Dress book better than most of the others I have read. Some of them have been lacking - some have been great. This one jumps to the head of the GREAT line. I found the characters interesting, the dialogue witty, the story entertaining and the romance believable. I look forward to more from this author. A really nice treat! Highly Recommended."
1,Not what I expected from Red Dress Ink,"Without blowing the plot, the hero is hardly the type of hero I'd want in real life or in Red Dress Ink life. His ""responsibilities"" leave something to be desired. And while I love British authors, the American editors went over the top with this one - too many British references and slang that I just couldn't figure out.The idea of this book is fun but the story itself fell short."
3,Good Fluff Book...nothing more,"This is the first RDI book I read. It was good fluff, which is why I ordered it. I do think that some of the characters could have been developed more, but strictly my opinion. My review is probably clouded by the performance of other RDI books, which shine. This book was predictable, even without reading the description of it. Good book if you just need something to read. It did have it's strong points though. I enjoyed the fact that all agony aunts aren't the ""Dear Abby"" types."
5,A New Twist on the Boy-Meets-Girl Story,"Name & Address Withheld is the refreshing new book from the Red Dress publishers. Unlike most of the other books in the RD collection, this story goes a little bit deeper that the average ""boy-meets-girl"" story. The book looks at how life isn't always perfect, and things sometimes don't happen like you had imagined...like maybe you will meet the guy of your dreams and it will turn out that he is married. I'm not encouraging others to become a mistress, however, this storyline makes you remember that sometimes life doesn't present itself as a perfect fairytale."
2,Don't get your hopes up,"As i picked up this book, i thought it would be very exciting and one of those books you cant put down. i was left frowning after the finish. as i really did enjoy the book while reading it, some parts were slow, as they are in all books. however, when i arrived at the ending i was left with more dissapointment then ever, a friend of mine felt the exact same way. so if you read it beware of the lousy feeling you will have when its all over."
2,I don't like it.,"I found the story to be boring, draggy, the author does not seem to have fresh ideas."
1,The Worst,"Gawd, why did I buy this book? Truth is the cover writing makes you think you are getting a story of a witty London working girl in the style of Bridget Jones or Confessions of a Shopaholic. What a let down. All of the characters are stereotypical with the exact same personality. Ridiculous coincidences---just very poorly written. Tried to get through it in the loo bur finally realised life is too short to suffer so. After 3/4 of the book I couldn't care less how it ends."
5,Great preschool-aged DVD,"We purchased this DVD for a recent road trip. The price was great and the length is perfect for a long jaunt in the car. It's a bit long for me to allow my three-year-old to watch in one sitting at the house, but when she's stuck in the car it's guaranteed wholesome entertainment. My little girl is sensitive to ""scary"" things in shows. She loves Clifford, and I love her watching something I don't have to worry about her being afraid of."
3,"""The Shot Heard Round the World""","The cartoon ""The Shot Heard Round the World"" was mediocre. It is aimed to teach little children about the Revolutionary War, but the writers left out a lot of information. They mentioned major battles and events, such as the Battle of Lexington and Concord, but did not go into detail. If older children listen to this song, they would not learn much. The writers did not mention the Battle of Saratoga which was the reason France and Spain joined the war. The writers also made Valley Forge sound too simple. They did not explain how the men at Valley Forge barely survived the winter. If the writers made these few changes, the cartoon would more educational for both audiences."
3,classical pink floyd,"I bought this for my nephew and he is 17 years old. Although Im very impressed with th musicians on this cd, it's definately not my cup of tea. For teenagers who want to experience a 'different texture' from this classic band."
2,Don't Expect Pink Floyd,"I enjoy string quartets and looked forward to this. Whereas Mozart, Beethoven and other classical or romantic composers are the masters of quartets due to their counterpoint and fugue, Pink Floyd music does not translate into string quartets. There is no power here, no dynamics; all necessary to Pink Floyd music. I kept wanting some electrification! The piano is capable of power, but not allowed to sound off in this recording and only provides an accompaniment to the mellow strings. It was boring. Does not have the complexity of the masters to maintain interest. Go to the classics with all their structure to enjoy string quartets for listening pleasure. Or, this could be a nice change for background at a dinner or reception where it's not cool to blast the speakers with real Pink Floyd."
1,Just awful,"I am an avid collector of all things Pink Floyd, including tribute albums. Of course none of them live up to the real thing, but this 'tribute' really does a terrible disservice to their music. For something of this ilk, go with either the Symphonic Pink Floyd ""Us & Them"" or the Royal Philharmonic Tribute. Only buy this one if you own EVERY other tribute CD ever made for Pink Floyd's music."
3,Grids do not line up with multiple sheets,"I bought this product so I could trace out an full scale layout for a double rifle case I wanted to have a custom foam insert cut for. I pulled enough pages from the book to lay out a 53x15 inch grid section. While trying to line up the pieces of paper so it was one giant grid pattern, I ran into problems with the grids from the individual pages were not lining up with each other. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the pages were not cut perfectly strait, they were at a slight angle which threw off my entire project. Luckly enough when I contacted the company who was going to be cutting my foam insert, they informed me that the grid did not need to be perfect, that they would make the necessary corrections when they fed it into there machine. So crisis overted.I gave to remainder of the pack to my girlfriend who loves to draw, but she has stopped using it, as the pages fall out every time she tries to use it."
5,Sounds Great!,"I installed these in my 2008 Nissan Frontier to replace the factory ones, 100% better sound quality at a great price."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking to change out the stock tweeters, but they where to big for the space available. I dont have anything against them and if I could find some pioneer tweeters to fit the space provided, would not hesitate to replace them. ONCE AGAIN NOTHING AGAINST THESE TWEETERS, JUST NOT WHAT I NEEDED. So be careful when you ordering, I made the mistake to believe any tweeter would fit."
5,dynamite comes in tiny packages,"Even though these tweeters are small, the sound output most definately opens up the highs and the in-line crossover works flawlessly too. I'd recommend these tweeters to anyone who wants to hear the high notes in their music; You'll be shocked at the difference and amazed at what you've been missing."
5,Great Tweeters,"I replaced my stock speakers with Sonys in my '99 Escort ZX2. They made a big difference. Then I added these Pioneer tweeters, and they really brought out the high notes. They are small, black, and easy to install. You can't go wrong."
3,not too confident about these,"they're just too quiet. i have 2 5x7's in the back of my car, and a 6 1/2"" sub under the seat, and these 2 tweeters up on the dash. i found that the sound was semi-balanced at best between the tweeters and the 5x7's in the back. they just don't seem to have enough volume. i'd hate to have to hook up another amplifier JUST for those 2 tweeters but that's about what it woudl take to get the sound i was expecting from them. they're good quality, there is no distortion or anything, just not loud or balanced enough from what i have experienced."
2,Unwanted words,"Although the music is very nice, the excerpts of the story ruins the beautiful music composed by John Williams. If it wasn't for that, this would be a 4 or 5 star album. At least there's one track without the story being told, and that's the only track I ever listen to."
3,Voice-Over Ruins the CD...,"When I saw Angela's Ashes in the Theater a few years ago, I was so taken with John Williams' beautiful score that I rushed right out and bought the Soundtrack CD. I was VERY disappointed to find that about 80% of the Score is drowned out by the over-dubbing of dialogue from the film. If I wanted to hear film dialogue, I would get the DVD and play that. It's too bad that Mr. Williams' lovely music is forced to play second fiddle to an actor playing Frank McCourt, and the CD packaging says NOTHING about every track having a monologue over the music. (There is an import version of the CD that omits the annoying voice-over, but that didn't do me any good......I had already bought this version.)"
3,Music - not words!,"Don't buy this terrible Sony release! The music is wonderful, but Sony decided to include some audio excerpts from the movie for the US release. When I buy a soundtrack CD, I want the actual music, not dialogue from the movie. - That's what videos are for!Fortunately there is a solution. Decca released the same score in Europe WITHOUT the annoying dialogue. It can be obtained through some mail order services that mostly deal with soundtracks. - The Decca release is well worth the hassle!"
4,Who needs the narration?,"I love John Williams' film scores, and ANGELA'S ASHES is no exception -- however -- who needs the narrator popping into multipal tracks? As a purest who decries the glut of so-called ""soundtrack"" albums featuring over-produced singles you never heard in the film, this is just one more example of a poor choice. There is hope, however. I just read that the soundtrack with the narration was only released in English-speaking countries! If anyone has a line on where I can get the CD sans the narrator, please post it here or let me know at: MAD51103@AOL.COM Thanks."
1,Amateur class NOT master class,"When you by a book with the word masterclass in the title you expect that the books aims at the semi pro/pro user/reader. that is not the case with Andy Rouses book it is aimed at the total beginner...with large typograhy, stupid looking info boxes and dull images it has more the look of a childrens book than a masterclass book for intermediate/experienced users. I really, really regret i spendt money on this useless product...my advice : stay far, far away from this book."
5,Another great vampire story,"This was really a great vampire story - Lois Tilton is definitely one of my favorite vampire authors. No cheesey romance, just great horror!"
5,Clear Teeth & Coffee too!,"My gardener, George, is dating a dental hygenist. As a result, he's become OBSESSED with keeping his (in his words) ""grill clean"" - refusing an icy cold cola drink the other day for fear it would stain his white-stripped teeth. It made me think... is there a way I can have my morning cup(s) of coffee without all the ground particulates, and teeth staining color? This syrup solved the problem. Add it to hot water, and waa-lah! Clear, coffee flavored beverage."
2,Not a whole lot of exercise here,"I was excited when I read about this DVD since I like the ""beach music"" and am always looking for new ""chair"" exercise DVD's. Although it's better than the ""Chair Boxing"" DVD (produced by the same company) it's not much of a workout for those who consider themselves to be in the beginner/intermediate stages of exercise.The audio is ""OK"", but it looks as though it has been filmed in the person's basement or patio.Not recommended. :("
2,Not for seniors,This is too fast paced for the elderly. It was too much for me and was not what I was expecting.I will never use the one I bought so it was a waste of my money
2,Don't bother,Not worth the money. The exercise routines are boring and I didn't feel I had any real workout.
3,A good horror movie,Do your self a favor and try to forget the hype - especially the hype coming from horror sites (whose writers really shouldn't be so squeamish). It's not THAT violent and it's not THAT disturbing.If you do that you might enjoy it more than I did.
4,You Want Morbid?,"This movie will makes your worst nightmare seem like a Saturday morning cartoon. The intense suffering of the hapless victims does serve a purpose, but you won't know what it is until the end. You'll need a strong stomach to get even halfway there. I'd like to put my ex-wife through this.Note: If you like this one, check out the Human Centipede movies."
3,Such a disappointment,"After reading the positive reviews, I was really anticipating adding a gnarly, harrowing, and unique horror flick to my collection. WRONG.Not in the least bit scary. I dozed off several times while watching it. Certainly not groundbreaking, or unique.Totally overrated!!"
3,Martyrs,"""Martyrs"" is a difficult film to watch, as well as review. I, myself, didn't enjoy it, but didn't feel like I wasted my money buying it, either. After all, it has all the elements that make up a great horror film - there's a lot of blood, it's filled with perilous situations, and the acting is great, which is a plus. The only problem is (and it's a big one) is how the film makes the viewer feel afterwards. It's not a good feeling. I, personally, felt mildly depressed. It's like reading Nietzche, or watching ""Salo,"" or looking at a Bruegel painting - some great works of art are not meant to make a person happy, but they should make a person think. After watching ""Martyrs,"" the only thought that I had going through my mind was ""what's the point?"""
3,Almost . . .,"I saw this at the store and I nearly bought it on impulse. Instead, I read the reviews here first. That made me want it even more. But now that I've seen it, I cannot consider it a messed-up clasic like Ichi or Irreversible. I give the director credit for trying, but he overreached.The first part, the main story arc, was very good. Also, I was surprised by the . . . departure . . . of one of the main characters only an hour into the movie. And I liked the direction the movie went in after that.(Sorry I'm being vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.)However, the whole 'Martyr' aspect- the motivations, the reasons behind it all- it seemed like a stretch. The metaphysical aspect was jarringly unnecessary. Plus, it ground the movie to a halt.Finally, it all would've been redeemable if only the final make-up effects looked a little more realistic. Sorry, but the rubber suit . . . that completely shattered the illusion for me."
3,"Avoids Convention, lacks commitment.","I purchased this movie seeking something. Not sure from the onset whether I was hoping for a revenge flick, an over the top torture circus or even a little lesbian psycho bitch fantasy or something completely unexpected. As I watch the credits roll, I get a little bit of everything rolled up in violent sushi roll. My only qualm is a lack of the character's POV during the transformation through the last third of the movie. No friggin' spoiler, I just wish I was given a little more insight leading into the coup de grace. Sure, I can make an inference & the film is fine as it sits, I just had to justify my 3 stars. It's solid, worth the dough, staying in my collection, just didn't deliver that 'gotta tell all me friends to check it out' factor.On the fence? If you liked ""Old Boy"" or ""Audition"" - Recommended!"
1,If u like sadistic torture porn,"This movie was getting interesting reviews so I thought I'd check it out. Wish I wouldn't have. If you get off to torture porn this movie is for you. take porn and switch it with torture and you get Martyrs. this movie has no redeeming qualities unless, once again you like torure porn."
1,disappointing,"i love Movies from other country's,i never watch american movies anymore.i waited for Martyrs for 2 months,i bought it today,watched it,i was very disappointed.not very violent,nothing to disturbing,just a Blah type movie,maybe i didnt enjoy Martyrs cause i am Desinsitized (SP)?? nothing is disturbing to me anymore. also stay away from (Frontiers) *Blah* of a movie.i dont mean to be so mean but eh..."
4,not for everyone,"wow what a disturbingly good movie this is one alot of people probally wont get but deserves credit its gory, suspenseful, and scary at times in many ways than what were used to.Brilliantly acted and looks so real u just have to watch it yourselves and decide i will say if u have a weak stomach and didnt care for hostel or the girl next door then avoid it other than that worth a look"
3,NOT for the faint of heart,"If you like scary Movies as I do you MAY like this Movie. It was recommended by a friend...however this is a very violent disturbing Movie. Also hard to understand the plot so had to watch it a couple of times to understand the entire story...without a ""Spoiler Alert"" and giving away too much I will say once you watch this it sticks with you from the brutality towards young women. It is not an American Movie but is dubbed so well you can't really tell. It has been compared along the line of ""Hostel"" BUT even tho it is very brutal there IS a plot and message Hostel didn't have. Not scary but VERY freaky, so you have been warned it IS brutal."
5,Genre Transcending,"The first hour is creepy, scary and brutal. The last forty minutes are brutal and ferocious as already stated in another popular review. One reviewer wrote on a popular horror website, that the last half hour is tough to sit through. Boy, was that review accurate. There is really nothing else to say without ruining the story. Watch this movie without knowing any details or major plot points. Avoid spoilers at all costs. You've seen gorier movies than this but, this movie is more phsychological in its horror. This movie had me thinking long after it ended. This movie was a blind purchase for me (as well as, High Tension, Inside & Frontiers), I have yet to be disappointed with French horror (just ignore the twist in High Tension). The gut-wrenching realism of Martyrs is what impressed me. Bottom line, when it's over, tell yourself....""It's only a movie."""
4,Solid and gruesome horror film from France,"This extremely gory horror film from France is obviously not for all tastes, but it is very well done and interesting for those with a strong stomach. It starts as a somewhat run of the mill - if extremely bloody - example of the torture porn film genre - a seemingly deranged woman enters a home and kills all the members of its seemingly nice family. But as the movie progresses, it turns into something else - the woman was kept by this family when she was a child in a dungeon - and it has a stunning and very original twist in the final and brutal last half hour - not going to reveal too much here, but this family was part of a sect seemingly trying to decipher some of life's existential mysteries. Overall, one of the best horror films released in the last few years."
4,This is MESSED UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm watching this as I write. It is messed up!!!!!!!!!If you don't mind gore, you probably won't mind this flick. But if you are squeemish at all, please....don't even attempt to watch this film..At this point I'm watching a girl relocate a body from the shower into the hallway. This is pretty intense. The gore is realistic for sure, no CGI.The gore is top-notch. the storyline isn't bad as I'm watching this flick unfold I wish that the basic story were a little deeper than what is presented. 4 stars for the gore, 2 stars for the acting........otherwise a 3 stars flick. I've seen comparisons to ""Inside"", and yeah, while the gore level is about on par, the basic story, while interesting and at times pretty intense, is not on the same level as ""Inside""."
1,excrement,"I foolishly thought this film would be other than worthless, paranoid, horrifying graphic, pretentious crap.Having viewed ""Salo"" and even the fascinating documentary ""Graphic Sexual Horror"" and found them interesting I thought I could watch anything.This film was gross in detail of injury, silly in plot, and alas boring.I want a refund, and my time back wasted watching this."
1,suckkked!!,This movie sucked big time.Yes it was bloody and gory.But it was not scary or a movie that sticks with you.It was just disgusting without a point.Save your money!
1,Stupid movie,"Really weird. I cannot recommend this movie and am sorry I bought it. The best I can say is, it fills in some dead time."
1,Disappointed,All I have to say is when I ordered the Martyr's Unrated version which I had been told is not cut in anyway shape or form I was excited and decided to order it off of Amazon what I got however was not the movie shown in the picture on this site but something completely different from what I ordered it did not come with a slip cover and it did not say Unrated on the DVD itself anywhere at all . Therefore I am giving this a bad review only because I did not receive the correct version that was advertised in the picture and am wondering what had happened whether there was a mix up or if I just ordered the wrong version of the movie.
4,Brilliant,"I am a huge fan of horror and gore films, though lately I have been unimpressed by many films of this genre. However, Martys is sheer brilliance. It isn't just the story, the gore, the music, etc. It is every aspect of this film that makes it so gut wrenchingly frightening.This film doesn't rely solely on gore or torture porn, it is seriously scary and brutal to watch, but if you are a fan of horror or can appreciate film as an art form, this must be seen."
4,Well i didn't see that coming..,This movie will take you in so many directions your head will spin. You will definitely find yourself sympathizing a lot.Some of the scenes are so difficult to watch because the thought is so horrific. I was literally in awe of some of the things that happened in the film. It dragged on at times but always kept you interested to want to find out WHY and WHAT will happen.The main reason it didnt get a 5 is because i watched this AFTER Frontier(s)..awesome movie and the ending was so ridiculous i actually sat there in disbelief throughout the whole credit roll.I can't believe they failed the ending so badly.Not for the fainthearted or the ones that cry easily. Some scenes are still burned in my memory.
4,Truly a Sick movie !,When I watched this I didn't know rather to cry or throw up ! I have to say this is what real horror is all about. But I truly felt sorry for these people when normally I'm laughing. Beware if you have a weak stomach especially the ending sequence. I was so shocked at how much violence was in this movie they even showed children being murdered ? This is a good movie but I just can't give it 5 stars because it's too depressing. I watched this once and once was good enough for a while. Watch this at your own risk and definitely prepare for the end. Because the people in this film are truly sick and unmerciful to say the least. This movie is truly Gut wrenching and that's putting it nicely !
2,Sick in the head,"Anyone that finds this film anything but sickening needs help, this is not art as I have read nor is it horror or even a good slasher flick, it's just plain old torture with a twist.That being said, the movie did hold my interest up to a point then it just got stupid. But if you are into sick minded torture be my guest. I've about had my fill of watching this trash, namely; (Frontiers, Hostel, and anything else that involves torturing young girls).Do they really think or hope there will be a sequel to this waste of time?"
2,Hmm a little ticked off,"My copy just arrived today, and it has a totally different cover from the one advertised on here.I personally really like it, its quite creepy, and gruesome, but this may bother others.Also the running time on imdb says 99min, and its advertised on here as 100min, and mine says 96min.. so im hoping that this isnt some weird cut version.I live in australia, and i went out of my way to order the unrated region 1 version, because it was 1 minute OVER the running time, and the region 4 (australian) copy says 97min, which is 2 minutes UNDER the running time.And as a result i end up with a version thats could very well be cut by either 3 or 4 minutes? Not cool amazon..I hope i didnt waste my money..Im giving 2 stars, because the artwork on the cover (that i recieved, not sure about the rest of you) impressed me, but having a complete and uncut version is whats most important to me."
1,Pure Crap !!!!!!,This is such a senseless movie. I do not like this movie at all. Not recommended at all. I do not even give this a one star.
2,speak french?,"movie is filmed in french and not indicated as such. having to read subtitles was distracting, otherwise full of blood and gore-great it dont mind reading."
2,ALL I CAN SAY IS HOSTEL,"THE MOVIE TO ME WAS BORING. THE IDEA OF DOING THAT TO SOMEONE FOR THEM TO REACH A CERTAIN POINT IN DEATH WAS STUPID. I LOST INTEREST WHEN THAT GIRL WAS BEING BEAT! ALL I CAN SAY IS THE HOSTEL MOVIES... OH YEAH, IN SIDE OF A BEAUTIFUL HOME IN A CABINET WAS A BASEMENT AND IN THE BASEMENT WAS A SUB BASEMENT! GET REAL! AND PREDICTABLE. JUST VOICING MY OPINIONS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SEEN THIS MOVIE MAY NOT LIKE WHAT I SAID BUT IM TELLING YOU, HOSTEL."
1,THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE!,"Like other reviewers, I agree with the fact that this movie sucks.This is not a horror movie!What you get is :Young women's scenes being hit by perverts the whole time.A woman get removed all her skin.In fact it's a movie made by some degenerate director of French cinemathat he/she doesn't have neither the most minimum idea of what is the cinema of horror.If you want to see horror cinema look forGeorge Romero or Wes Craven titles as examplesof what a horror movie is about it."
4,An incredibly harsh and graphic horror movie with a point,"This movie is what happens when a mad scientist creates a hybrid of Hostel, The People Under The Stairs, The Passion of the Christ, and Hellraiser. This is an impressive horror movie that tries to be more than just an excuse for gore and scares and largely succeeds.That said, this is an extremely harsh and graphic film, with a lot of unsettling subject matter and visuals. Not recommended for the faint of heart.One could argue that this is just an artsy exploitation flick. To that, I counter with the simplest of arguments: exploitation films exist for the visceral thrill, whereas art continues to live with you after the experience on emotional and intelligent levels. Martyrs will stay with you for a while, will make you think and remember the characters, and for that alone, this film rises above pure exploitation."
2,Killing Madness,"It's a terrible story of mad researchers (or who?) sadistically ushering people to a brink of a death to study near-death experiences from their victims-turned-presumably-MESSANGERS (martyrs)of the other worlds.Crazy, insane, perverted idea, and movie is even much more of questionable reasons."
1,Martyrs Was Painful to Watch (but not in a good way),"I am a HUGE fan of horror/slasher type movies and I can watch just about ANYTHING- but this movie left me feeling sick and disgusted with myself after is was all over. I am sickened that this was even made in the first place. The plot summary intrigued me and I thought it may be something like Darkness (Spanish horror movie)- but this movie ended up having no plot or resolution. For most of the movie you were watching a very large man violently pummel a small, chained woman. It felt like I was watching a snuff film. The beatings went on and on and on until they had almost killed her and then they skinned her alive. I will not even go into why they said that they were doing this because the reason is so absurd. Basically, if you choose to watch this movie you will just watch a man graphically beat on a woman for about an hour or so. If that is your choice of entertainment then perhaps you should seek help."
1,"If you enjoyed this, get help","This is not actually a film. A film is supposed to be a story.What this is, is a flimsy and poorly contrived pretext to show graphic torture. It's a snuff film. There is no redeeming feature whatsoever, no merit, nothing to be gained. As a horror afficionado who doesn't mind being shocked, I have a very liberal idea when it comes to censorship... but this filth should be banned, unless you believe snuff movies should be available for purchase.Someone who wishes to be an artist but has no soul cannot create beauty. All they can create is something that shocks people with souls, or scratches the itch of sadists. Hence this ""movie"".I advise you to avoid anyone who claims to have enjoyed this ""movie"". Such a person has a spiritual sickness beyond human power to cure. To such folk, I wish you all the best and hope you find the healing you need."
5,chef-d'oeuvre!,"A quest for retribution spins horribly out of control in this unrelentingly brutal, gut-wrenching and emotionally devastating French stunner. A modern masterpiece, not for the easily disturbed."
5,My new favorite of the genre,"This is a very well-made movie. It has an excellent and thought-provoking story-line. It is also extremely disturbing, and will take a while after seeing it to fully digest what you had seen. I bought this on DvD at first. I watched it (and I did need a few breaks) and let it sit for a few days. Any movie that is original, provokes an emotional response and causes me to think about it for a long period of time goes to near the top of ""my list."" I later bought it on blueray and gave my dvd copy to a friend.I heard somewhere that Fox is remaking this and changing the ending. Sometimes it seems like all we do is remake movies. I am never going to see our remake of this."
5,Runs great,I finally received this after almost 2 weeks of waiting. Right out of the box it ran great. Hooked to two log cars it looks great. I would liked to have had a brighter headlight but that's not that important. I'm well satisfied with this purchase. I have a couple other Backman Spectrum Locos but this one runs the best
3,Should have been better!,"I think Rough Cutt used to write some really good songs and after hearing once I live Rough Cutt concert on the radio which was really heavy I expected alot. Unfortunately the heart is torn out of this CD with the recordings of Black Widow, Take Her and Dreamin' Again which sound as if they were recorded in an oil drum. Also the three studio songs are not from the Rough Cutt I used to know, as they are really grungy. The rest of the CD is good so only three stars. I cannot believe it as they apparently spent months selecting recordings for this CD. I wish a had a copy of that live concert on the radio."
4,Backing cardboard not thick,"I'm a professional writer, so I've become a bit of a snob about legal pads. I was looking to buy an Ampad type that has an extra-thick back (they're great -- it's as stable as a table-top). But that product wasn't available through Amazon Prime and, being a cheapskate, I opted for this pad to avoid this shipping charges.Something in the language of the description led me to think it had the extra sturdy back, too, but that wasn't the case. (That could easily have been my fault, after swimming through the descriptions of 20 different pads looking for an analog of that Ampad pad...)That said -- well, it's a pad a paper, right? Perfectly fine, very smooth surface, etc. No complaints on that front.All in all a fine product, just not exactly what I was looking for."
4,I'll give these pads the benefit of any doubt.,"This was my 2nd purchase of this hole-punched, 6-pack. The quality of the first purchase was excellent but the second purchase...not so much. The hole-punching process caused the sheets to stick together around the punched holes on all 6 pads. I had to separate the sheets by hand as I used them. My guess is that the hole-punch blades were dull and needed to be sharpened or replaced. I was just one of the unlucky customers who received these poorly punched pads. I will give this product the benefit of any doubt and purchase again when it comes time to reorder."
1,Misleading title for product,"When I purchased this product It looked as though it was more than just one ream for the price. I only received one. When I called they said it was advertised for one, not if you read the ad closley."
4,Contains all the Impressions songs I wanted.,"This CD had all the obscure songs I wanted by the Impressions. It was the best I could ask for; the only reason I gave it 4 stars is their songwriting was not completely to my taste. ""Fool For You"" is great and I haven't heard that song since 1970. (That song's unusual sound comes from its uncommon 9/8 meter.) Other songs I remember from long ago are the social commentary song ""Choice of Colors,"" ""Amen,"" and ""It's All Right."""
4,CCM award,"Fall was selected as indie album of the month by CCM magazine. This was their second CD, other than compilations with other groups. One of the rarest FOP productions. Might consider ""Fresh Roast"" from Focus on the Family"
3,early work,"Five o'Clock People is an amazing band, but this album is more formative than definitive. For fans, it's worth collecting. For potential fans, I'd recommend starting with The Nothing Venture (easier to find, too) or another of their later releases."
3,Il Trittico,Volume had to be boosted. There was no libretto which was very disappointing. Perhaps Amazon could mention this in their description of the product. I'm reluctant to order other operas if they have no librettos.
4,Probably the Best of Serge Blenner,"I have most of his music. One thing for sure. There is nobody on the face of the earth who makes music similiar to Serge Blenner. His music has rock beats, unique instumentation, and just a very tiny hint of religious feel to it. One of my favorite artists."
3,"Jag, second season, had flame outs","First season of JAG was a great way to introduce the show. I saw second season taking the show in sort of a different direction. Didn't quite mesh into the ""flow"" of things. It's good to watch, to be able to see how the characters developed. I certainly feel that later episodes really got the show really going well."
3,"Good, especially for the patriotic and romantic.",The quality of acting as well as the dialogue increases with every season as you get familiar with the actors.
1,Disappointed,The item arrived promptly but I am unable to view it as it is for Region 1 and I need Region 4 but this was not stated in the ad.
3,JAG Season 2,"Although the extras are minimal and the episode commentaries are not especially informative, the episodes themselves are a must have for all Harm and Mac fans. This is Catherine Bell's first season with the JAG corps and the beginning of the nine year relationship between her character, Sarah MacKenzie, and David James Elliott's Harmon Rabb, Jr. This season was JAG at its best, light hearted and fun, while at the same time exploring some serious issues."
3,It's ok,"It's not as good as I remember it being on TV, but it isn't bad. It's certainly better than the first season was, but I don't know that I will be getting any of the other seasons."
4,grows on you,I had never seen JAG until I was watching NCIS. Thought I would check out JAG since it was the same producer. Season 1 was very slow and hard to get into but I read reviews about the changes in season 2 and purchased it on faith it would be better than season 1. Season 2 is great and I've already ordered season 3.
3,"What happened to the ""cliffhanger""?","I agree with all the other reviewers that this is an excellent, well-written action series.However, I'm rather angry at the producers for ending Season 1 with a cliffhanger (i.e. Harm has been arrested for murdering his ex-girl friend), then abandoning that storyline without resolving it.Season 2 opens with a brand new episode, totally ignoring the unfinished final episode of the first season.That is unfair to fans of the series and an insult to their intelligence.:-("
3,Is it all there,The copy we received does not have the follow up to the previous seasons final episode. I think some of the episodes may be missing.
2,Entertaining!,"For a B type film Caged Women 2 is not too bad! Director/Star Ivan Rogers does a fine job acting and brings his character to life. Acting by other members of the cast is not too good but i would have to give them an A for trying. I not only found this movie entertaining but i was in it (I am one of the faces at the start of the film). I thought the color and sound used in the film were excellent and was actually better than what i thought it would be. Ivan Rogers got the most out of what he had for this film which reflects favorably upon his directing and acting ability. For something to do on a rainy day why not rent or buy this movie, sit back with some popcorn, and enjoy. Don't forget to shuffle the kids into another room as parts of this film are for adults only."
1,slim till dead dvd,"I was very unhappy with the dvd. I ordered it in english. The front of the box is in english, and the movie inside the box was in Chinesse. We cannot watch the movie. I will not order from you again."
1,"Love Joe Walsh, hate the dvd","I agree, save your money unless you don't know how to tune a guitar (and I can tell you how for a lot less money). The dvd looks as though it was recorded 20 years ago. Sound and video quality are lousy. There is pretty much no instruction except for a couple of different tunings and a brief how-to on slide. Joe is a great player in my opinion, but not a great teacher, at least as evidenced by this video."
5,convex mirror,thought i wold try it on my motorcycle drilled two holes on face shield and whamo i see what i could not see before great saftey addition not bad for twenty one bucks
4,Convex ski and MORE Mirror,"Very funtional, nice and it serves its purpurse well even for other then skiing.It gives a nice rear view of the boat, the water,and the passengers wich makes it a good safety ficture.The white color version should have be made more available.The price is the best that I found anywere, Good thing!!Good product overhall; I got two extra ones a gave them to my friends."
5,PEANUT,"NICE MIRROR, NICE PRICE...IT IS A VERY GOOD SIZE AND GIVES A VERY NICE WIDE ANGLE VIEW OF WHAT'S BEHIND ME, EITHER BEING TOWED OR ANOTHER BOAT OVERTAKING ME...I WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT IT....LUV IT.."
4,sturdy,I bought this as a replacement of the other brand of mirror that broke so easily. This is a sturdy mirror and a better one for the boat.
2,Cheap Design,"Plastic surrund is thin/flexible, and it doesn't appear or feel well made. Also, the screws that mount it to the windshield frame contact the frame, which will cause scratching and marring. It's going back and I'm going back to CIPA."
2,style vs substance,"It's an interesting approach, but randomly throwing a bunch of symbolism around does not necessarily generate meaning."
1,Much ado about nothing,"Watched 15 minutesBored to tearsTrippy space movie about ...Oh yeah, fast forwarded, didn't miss anythingGone already!:("
4,Psycho-jail going space,"Probably, it is a French answer toOz,Star Wars,The Terminatorand a German movie of such experimenting in local jail on the Earth (I will further recall its title), as somehow mutated (or created artificially to dub on inmates) criminal settled at the special space station-aliens' laboratory used to researching earthlings' criminal brines and habits.Homo sapiens had won-but did the Earth win from their returning home???It is a nice futuristic sci-fi horror anyway."
5,This is an important book for all men.,"Although I haven't read it, my uncle wrote it so it must be good"
4,"great, well-balanced guide","While this book is a little hard to follow for someone who isn't familiar with PSO, it is a repository of excellent information, especially the maps and the Maglopedia. I personally think it gives just enough information to help gameplay, without giving away so many secrets that it's no longer fun."
3,One Thing,"I really needed the guide to explain the ultimate mode since I have the dreamcast version number 2. THis really helped in everything else, but it was kind of a bummer to stop there."
3,We need more,"The best thing about this guide are the detailed maps and quest walk-thrus. Other than that, it's lacking in other areas. While the mag guide section is O.K., it doesn't tell you anything about evolving mags beyond the 2nd evolution. And it doesn't tell you hardly anything about the rare mags. There are glaring errors and misinformation throughout the guide, but this is understandable since the guide was rushed into publication. What is inexcusable is the total lack of pictures, descriptions, and ways to find the rarest of the rare weapons and armors in this game. But if you're looking for a good source for mag raising and PSO maps, then this guide is O.K., just not great."
5,"Excellent Guide, Outstanding Author","Very informative, well written guide in investing in coins. The author possesses unquestionable authority on the subject and has a remarkably well-honed ability to write on an academic topic in an exciting manner. He is sharp-witted and enjoyable. The book is very complete and most importantly - relevant and timely. If you wish to invest and collect coins this is a must have guide."
4,A rare coin reference book with a historical perspective,"This reference book offers general history on various rare coins. It also offers some tips on how to find the best deal and sell for maximum profit. Overall, I would say that this book is more leaning towards the historical aspect of rare coins. So if you are interested in finding out the history behind each coin, this is the book for you."
4,Great intro to coin collecting,"Not only is this book helpful to the novice starting out in coin collecting, it provides useful insight to people with more experience. This book offers a lot of information to anyone looking to collect rare coins. It provides historical insight into numismatics, as well as historical insight into the coins themselves. The book breaks down into various areas including types of coins (i.e. copper, silver, gold, etc). There is a lot of information in this book, but it will offer details and insight into the many various aspects of collecting coins."
2,this book has ads,"I appreciate all of the useful info from Mr. Bowers. But I dont like the ads throughout the guide, or his occasional sexxed up bend on the facts. I would have much rather appreciated his facts presented in a classy academic manner with no ads."
2,Coin Handbok,"I could have done without this book. Its design is flawed, and the binding is stiff and brittle. I prefer the Redbook or Bluebook."
5,Good,I should've check that this was wide-ruled since I wanted college-ruled but whatever. It works just the same.
1,Save your money. It doesn't work.,"I have very thick toenails so this product looked to be a godsend. I followed the directions exactly. Final analysis? Doesn't work. Save yourself some money and do this instead: fill a large bowl or bucket with very warm water and either bath oil or olive oil. Make sure you have a towel for your feet, and a good book or magazine to read. Soak your feet for at least 30 minutes - 45 is even better. Take one foot out of the water, pat dry and cut the nails Immediately before they start to dry and harden. Keep the other foot in the foot-soak while cutting the first foot's nails. Then repeat with the other foot. If your nails are still hard to cut, soak for longer. This of course works really great when someone else is doing the cutting and all you're doing is soaking and reading :-)"
4,good protagonist,"well paced novella,,characters and world building I want to know more about,Farewell Horizontal does share a failing common (and probably necessary) to free e book offerings, it is incomplete,"
4,Good read about a strange place,"As always five stars must be reserved for something special but this is a solid four. Also as always, did I enjoy the story? Yes I did. The hero isn't always very likable but he is a plugger. The setting is strange but not fantasy. It is all plausible except possible the body stealing. If you like science fiction you will like Cylinder and the inhabitants. If you are not a science fiction reader you will enjoy the story. No noticeable problems with proofreading or editing."
3,"Not Jeter's Best, but Surely Worth Reading","It deserves to be read. It is an ambitious experiment: can a novel reproduce a videogame? Jeter succeeded in doing that. The novel is a videogame. But it is a videogame on paper, peopled by characters with a soul and a (sometime) questioning mind (one of these is Sai). The apparent plot is a frantic adventure in a surrealistic virtual world whose shape is a scandal for reason. But here and there Jeter suggested that things aren't exactly what they seem (he was a friend of Philip K. Dick, after all), and there's more in this novel than the breathless quest of Ny Axxter in a grotesque cyberworld (maybe the ultimate cyberworld). Basically it is a satire of many aspects of the videogame imagery/subculture, and a discussion of its covert ideology. Not as food as other novels by the same author, Dr. Adder and The Glass Hammer, but a novel worth reading. And subtly funny most of the time. 'Tis a pity it's out of print!"
2,Hmmmmm,This book was recommended to me by a friend. I will take his recommendations with a grain of salt in the future.
3,Disappointing ending,"This book started off well, with an interesting world creation and descriptions. The main character is likable and he ends up in an interesting situation of having to save his own life by doing something no one has ever done before. However, the end seemed rushed and contrived. You are left with many questions that are not answered. Overall this book was dissatisfying."
4,Farewell Horizontal,"This is a very edgy sci fi book, that not everyone will like. Your mind has to be very elastic to encompass the world created by Mr. Jeter, to understand what is happening in this saga. Personally it is not my cup of tea, though it is well written and very creative on the edge sort of work. It's just a little too far out for my tastes, though a lot of new agers will probably love it. Hard living on the edge of a destroyed civilization, where a man struggling to survive on his terms, finds that the system that he is supposed to use and trust as absolute, is absolutely corrupted by the top people he wants to get lose to and who in the end are out to eliminate him, due to his knowledge. Fast paced, rock 'em sock 'em gore type of novel that the Gen. Exers will love. I give it a 4.5 on my scale out of 5 Stars."
1,Office Discount Supplier,This supplier ran a bait and switch scam..I would never ever recommend purchasing any item from them. Once they charge your credit card and have your funds they should be obligated to either send the order as promised or not charge your credit card at all. not make you wait and they use your money for a month or longer.. my review of this company..the worst.
4,Pretty Good,"The polarizer came quickly and undamaged. Its performance is great as I'v had no problem taking away pesky reflections when at the proper angles. There are no problems with the quality of what its suposed to do. I do not like the slim filter personally because i cannot attach my ND filter holder (screw in) to it, nor is it possible to even put on your lens cap. My small fingers are able to adjust it easy enough but sometimes it gets lodged onto my lense for some unknown reason. Also, amazon had charged me with shipping (which I expected), but when the delivery guy came to the door he double charged me for the same price."
2,A&E Bios are are Sensational. *,"A&E; Biography gets worse as it goes along. Sensationalist*, unattributed claptrap.I feel deceived and it wasn't even fun. They even edited classic works of art to serve their purpose.(*See, I fooled you.) Flotsam. The colors are pretty and the music is nice."
5,Window Visor,I had a different In Channel on the former truck. I kind of had a problem installing them. On the new truck I purchased the tapeless window visor and found them to be easy to install and better built then the other ones. I recommend this product and seller. They where here with a couple of days.
4,real nice print,Very finely done print suitable for most any room. There are some other radiographs of the daffodil from the front but the side is the most elegant i think. I really like mine and recommend it.
1,Don't waste your money,"I am a longtime Ratt fan who owns their entire collection and have seen them live many times. They never disappointed me -- until this one. Bottom line, this ""album"" is horrible, and the band should be ashamed for taking their fans' money this way. Something well short of the original Ratt posse delivers what can best be described as an unpolished, garage-band product. And believe me, I'm being generous. I still love Ratt, but I have to Tell the World that the boys should feel nothing but Shame Shame Shame on this one."
5,Raw is GREAT !!!,"This is what a CD sounds like when MGNT doesn't get involved ...ARTISTIC CREATIVITYThere are some repeats, but with a different beat.Ratt On !!"
2,Tired.,"I like Ratt's music, but the musicianship was poor on this C.D. The band sounded tired. There are a few of good songs and I am a fan so.. Their latest, Ratt Infestation sounds like they're back on track. I'd like to see them live."
3,"Not their best, but not the worst.","I was disappointed at the number of remixes...but they are good remixes...except for the remixed Arcade material (Stephen Pearcy's other band).The remix of ""Lovin' You's a dirty job"" was pretty cool...the fact I could really hear their bass player for the first time was definitely cool.Not as cool as the latest album...or their more classic albums...but not as bad as Motley's new material either."
3,Mixing new crunch with 80's metal power cords,The new thacks on this album show the deversity of one of the 80's best least known guitarists. Werren DeMartini is in prime form as the rythum section deminstrates there deversity to mix new styles with old metal beats. Pearcy's vocals are trying at times and almost drowned out at others which isn't a bad thing. The taste of new material is probibly an attempt of a new record label to test the market and see if a commitment is worth the capital. What ever you say about the boys this is a must have for true ratt & roll fans. If round and round is all you have herd from the group then this is a real shocker. I will recommend this album to any one with either two ratt albums in there archives or interested is something new but familiar.
3,HMMM,I really enjoyed the blusey rythyms on this album and the first track...Steel River...wow! What a freaky departure. I like that though. Not like the last 1000 def leppard records that I all sound like Hysteria. I think it is really cool that these guys keep on after all these years..Rock on!!!
3,Not smooth,"Product seems to do the basics, earning three stars; I cannot comment on the spare battery charger, having not tried it. Coming from the Blackberry world, where there are some very nice, easy charging stands for my BB Bold, I was looking for the equivalent for my Nexus One, feeding power into what appear to be charging points on the body of the phone. What I got instead was a stand with a clumsy USB plug feeding into the phone. I don't know if the problem is a design limitation of the Nexus One or just this stand. It takes the usual micro-USB fumbling to get the connector into the socket, a frustrating disappointment, but it does work. I don't bother taking this traveling with me, since it's just as easy to use the USB cable directly and prop the Nexus up on whatever's handy."
4,Works well,"I was having a hard time finding a suitable product to adhere a carpet pad to a concrete basement floor so I could stretch the actual carpet without the pad bunching. I purchased a cheaper product from my local Lowes that didn't work well. While this product was a bit expensive, it worked very well. I believe I could have stretched it a little to allow it to go a bit further, but since I had never used this product, I followed the recommendations listed on the label."
3,A fine supplementary to a more rigorous book.,"As a math undergrad I found that concepts were explained in an easier to understand way in this book than in my course textbook (Abstract Algebra by I.N. Herstein), though some instructors might not appreciate the layman language (especially if it shows up on a test!), I thought there were not enough solved examples, plenty of unsolved examples though."
4,Abstract Algebra Review,This book does not provide enough examples to beginners. Also this book does not cover Galois Theory in detail but the exercises are well ordered .
2,Not at these prices ($100+),"I am only giving it two stars because it is way over-priced. As a means of getting introduced to Abstract Algebra is really good. I also know that there are other sources that are also good. For one look at Groups and their Graphs by Israel Grossman. It is not as extensive as Pinter's, but will give you a great running start at this subject at a small fraction of the cost. Also try web resources, or your local university library."
5,Superb introduction to abstract algebra,"I fully agree with the comments of the previous reviewers. This introductory book on abstract algebra is simply superb.The author uses a discursive language, pretty unusual for a book of this type but extremely effective. While going through this book, you have the impression not of reading a textbook but of ""listening"" to the author talking to you.I am not a professional mathematician, and therefore I don't feel entitled to judge about its mathematical rigor but I have read and studied similar textbooks on the subject (like Fraleigh and Gallian) and the clarity of this book surpasses them all.The author provides lots of exercises and some worked out solutions.Definitively this is my strongest recommendation for a book on this subject."
5,Can't put this book down,"I've only began reading the first few chapters, but I can already say this book is a masterpiece. So clear and easy to grasp! A must read for anyone interested in algebraic structures."
5,Immensely satisfying,"I truly enjoyed this book. Basic abstract algebra is developed in a rigorous yet conversational manner. Each chapter has numerous problems that challenge the reader's understanding and often foreshadow what is yet to come. What is unusual about the book is that the author sets out a specific goal: prove that the quintic polynomial has no general solution using radicals, i.e, no solution along the lines of the quadratic equation. Each chapter builds on what has come before, and by the time you get to the last chapter, you have become adept at the various abstractions. Structures like homomorphisms, quotient groups, rings of polynomials, and ideals all become clear. After finishing the book, I felt like I had, with the aid of an excellent guide, climbed a difficult mountain with a spectacular view and was proud to have summited. I can't remember finishing a math text with such a satisfying feeling. If only he had written a successor book. I'd buy it in an instant."
5,Good Introduction,"As someone who came to this book knowing absolutely no algebra at all, this book was great. The chapters are nice and short, but contain plenty of exercises, for which there are selected answers in the back. It covers a lot of material, and will prepare you take on a more advanced book like dummit and foote. It is also cheap. All in all this is the book you want if you are looking to self study algebra."
2,Nothing to write home about,"It is a short read. Not much detail here. He starts with the text already translated and that is a disappointment. It seems that most of the real discussion involves the original text.With that said, most readers will not want to spend days learning French, Latin and other languages to be able to read the quatrains. So the average reader may enjoy this quick and dirty examination of Nostradamus and his predictions. Consider it a beach read."
4,Cider House Rules,This is a moveing sound track as was the movie. I enjoyed it and I have it on my computer all the time as I work. It makes you thankful for things you have in your life cause of the wonderful family I have and was raised in.
5,The Cider House Rules,"The soundtrack gave me goosebumps. It truly captured the mood of the story in a melancholy, yet entrancing way. Rachel Portman has a gift for making you a part of the story with her music."
5,Music From Cider House Does RULE!,"Rachel Portman does it again. She is one composer that stands apart from the rest. After a number of beautiful offerings, (Joy Luck Club, Emma, etc), she gives us another incredible and skillfully directed score. Whats especially great about this soundtrack, is that you can sit back and relax to Portman's music over and over and not tire of it. I actually heard this score before seeing the film. Of course then I had to purchase the DVD because I wanted to see the story that goes with the beautiful music. A very moving film with music that enhances it. I highly recommend this score to everyone who appreciates subtle themes that are gently weaved thoughout the entire soundtrack. This score RULES!"
4,Rules to be heard,"The Cider House Rules: Music from the Miramax Motion PictureThe soundtrack is wonderfully evocative of the theme, time, and place of the movie. It is both simple in theme and yet grand in its musicality. I highly recommend it."
3,"Catchy, but...","I bought this CD because I could not get the MAIN THEME out of my head (since they played it in OSCARS) so many times. I liked the main theme, and the other tracks that included that melody. But the other tracks weren't so catchy and it sounded like a big blur."
5,Inspiring and Reflective,"I have collected dramatic score soundtracks for over 15 years. This soundtrack ranks in the top 5%. The piano and orchestral accompaniment make this recording a must for all serious collectors. It will uplift and inspire you, as well as invite you to see the film again and again."
5,Incredibly beautiful soundtrack,"I was bowled over by this soundtrack. It is absolutely stunning. Simple yet lush, unpretentious yet poignant. Words are just inadequate to describe the beauty and emotional impact of this music. Easily my favorite soundtrack of all time."
4,He understands ---,"I've had the priviledge of seeing & hearing (and chanting along with) Dave Stringer in person twice. Given that he explains the meaning of the words when introducing a chant, I'd have to say he understands.At one of these workshops, I learned the story of how Dave came to chanting. He originally went to India with a documentary film team. He became so enthralled with the chanting he encountered there that he ended up staying and studying there, immersing himself in the culture and the language.Some of the songs (e.g., ""I and Me"")on Brink seem to bring an American sensibility to the concept of chanting. This could confuse or annoy purists, but one of the things about Stringer that appeals to me is his ability to convey the universal aspects of chants.It's hard for me to imagine what this album would sound like to someone who has not seen Dave's passion in action, but it is both deep and light-hearted, an important contribution to the chanting genre."
5,Excellent old movies,I bought this for a friend that loves westerns. He said the quality of the films is great for movies of that age.
4,Old Movies,I gave this set of western movies as a gift to my brother. He has enjoyed watching the old time western stars he hasn't seen or thought of in years. Good choice if you like the old legends.
1,OK FOR FILM HISTORY BUFFS,"First of all, I agree with those who complain about poor lighting, scratchy sound, clumsy plot lines, and wooden acting/directing. After all, 37 of the 50 films offered date from the '30s to the early '40s. Possibly there were a lot of start-up film makers then who produced films of little lasting interest to any but the most ardent buffs. You will find in this collection the usual barroom brawls, individual fistfights, tough-looking men riding horses at top speed, in groups or singly, firing pistols with apparently 50-round magazines, and of course slim blonde heroines with shrill voices and zero personalities. A number of films seem to have damaged sections, making plot-following even more difficult.I purchased this ""collection"" several months ago from Amazon on sale for $10, so I can't complain too much. Moreover, I was recovering from a broken hip and consequent hip replacement surgery, so I had a lot of empty time to fill. I had hoped for better."
4,cord cutters Cowboy fix,"This sort of replaces the Western channel for the kind of shows on TV when I was a kid. Great nostalgia, mostly B-movies though."
3,It was a Christmas Present.,This was a great Christmas gift for my grandfather.. He loves old western movies and this was more than he expected.. He loved the variety of movies on the DVD.
4,Western Legends 50 Movie Pack,"The Western Legends 50 Movie Pack is a must for any fan of westerns of yesteryear. This package includes a lot of western actors that I haven't seen in years and a few I had forgotten. These are classic westerns that will bring back memories and also take you back in time when you did not have to be concerned with offensive language, illicit sex, and blood and guts found in so many movies today."
1,"Lies, lies and more lies.","So, I purchased this for my father-in-law for Christmas. Just received a call from him that says the entire thing does not even contain anything with John Wayne it it. There are western movies sure, but well over half the items are not even the ones listed. I would refrain from purchasing this unless you like surprises."
1,Very poor quality of picture and sound.,Picture and sound was of extremely poor quality. After looking at one and 1 half movies we turned it off. Would not recommend it to anyone.
3,not what i expected,I thought these would be great for my 2 year old but they are creamy and wet. They look nice when finished but definitely need to be supervised. Not what I expected although they are nice. I will keep them for when she gets older.
1,Old and Tired,I bought this for my husband for Christmas as he loved the Buffoons when he was younger. Sadly we were both disappointed with this recording which sounds like some old men trying to re-capture their glory days and make a few pennies at the same time. Don't waste your money on this.
2,Teach Yourself Violin (Step One),"This book and accompanying CD is not for someone who knows absolutely nothing about a violin and reading music. The first pages of the book are good then it ""jumps right into it"" making you feel like something is missing. The CD is also advanced. I expected something more on the lines of fingering and wrist techniques, reading music, etc. If this is what you need and are looking for, it's not in this book."
3,Typos distracted me,"I thought this book was well-written and compelling, but the abundance of typos in the text distracted me from the story. I'm surprised that Manet would be published by somebody who can't even hire a decent proofreader. I know this complaint seems trivial, but it really does take away from the story when you see typos all over the place."
3,"Great story, problems with typos","I loved the story of these two lovers in Cuba. Manet is a brilliant writer. He really evokes a strong sense of time and place. My criticism with this novel, however, is the fact that the typos in the text disrupted the flow of the story. I'd be reading along, and then hit a typo, it would break the spell. I'm surprised that, in this day and age, a publisher can't produce a book devoid of such problems, beginning with the imprint being mispelled on the title page. But, it is a wonderful story, which is to Manet's credit, that he can overcome the failures of the publisher to produce a perfect product. I recommend this book--but be forewarned about this glitch."
3,"Good, but not enough information on the MS Outlook client.","This book very in depth on the exchange client, but I was disappointed that it only offered one chapter over MS Outlook. I was hoping for an indepth explanation on how Outlook works with 5.0, instead I got an overview on how to use Outlook."
4,Interesting,"Don't let the size of this book daunt you. It reads as breezily as a 500-page PEOPLE Magazine article.I was never a big fan of Capote's; my memories of him are more from the last years of his life, when he was drunk on a lot of talk shows. But I found this book interesting and have since bought a copy of ""The Complete Stories of Truman Capote."""
2,I've read better,"This has to be the second worst book that I've read in along time. His flings and the details that the writer goes into aren't always that interesting. The writer does name names and some are a shock and make you think. However, saying that the book could of been pared down at least 75 pages by omitting some details of his love life I didn't care to know."
5,Exceptional,"**Very highly recommended for the Capote-obsessed.** Clarke has every piece of information about Capote that a reader can dream of, and this in turn clues the reader in to what drove Capote. From childhood to death, Capote's life becomes an intriguing story that rivals his own writings."
5,Only book you need to eat right,I have read MANY books on eating right. This is the last book you will ever need if you are searching for how we should really eat.
5,What a Blessing!,Finally a book that explains what our bodies need and don't need when it comes to food. It's amazing the toxic things we so unquestioningly consume. Dr. Russell has given our family the guidelines we have been looking for and it's no wonder that we're all feeling so much healthier. No more quilt for eating the foods that are so good for us. I'd recommend this book to anyone trying to find a simplified and biblical approach to eating.
4,What the Bible Says About Healthy Living,A very good book but it is too full of repetitions. This book could have been condensed.
5,What the Bible says about Healthy Living,This book has definiately made me review my opion on certain foods and I needed to make some hard choices. I can say it is not only inte4resting but as a nurse seems both scientificly and spiritaly sound. I have recommended this book to my family to read.
4,Good book,A good book to learn about what we were intended to eat and how to live according to the bible.
4,Electric Razor Shaving Solution,"Works like a charm with my electric razor, brings up hair for a smoother and closer shave. Not too complicated, pour a little into the palm, rub into facial hair, wait 10 seconds, shave. Number one ingredient is alcohol, thus it has a bit of an initial bite, or sting, plus a couple second potent alcohol smell. Leaves the face feeling smooth, and with a very mild chemical scent. Impossible to find at any department stores."
5,Fascinating view of Columbine High School shootings,"I had the opportunity to see PEACEJAM at the Newport Beach Film Festival. It was really moving and inspirational. The most interesting part of the movie was the description of the Columbine High School shootings, from the point of view of two of the young people who were in the cafeteria at the time it happened. Also, it gave the story of Richard Castaldo, who was in the movie, ""Bowling for Columbine"". I really enjoyed this documentary and learned a lot from it."
4,VERY ENTERTAINING AND MOVING,I'd heard about this organization and assumed the DVD would be like watching a big lecture. Not so. Watching it with my two daughters we were all amazed how moving and entertaining it was. Hardly a hard sell it really gets to you when you hear the kids tell their stories. And just when you get nice and relaxed they spring Columbine on you in an up close and personal way like I've never seen before. My kids and I were wiped out and inspired by film's end. SEE THIS NOW.
1,"very little tree, too much synthetic music.",The title says it for me. I love environmental sounds such as surf wind et.. Ibought this CD with the expectation hat it would be just the sounds of trees in a breeze maybe rain but what I got without any waring was the opening sounds of trees then the restrictive and artificial sounds of synthesizer music. Whatever comforting effects the trees were about to have was destroyed for me. Now some may find this kind of blend fine but I would like the item descriptions to say if a CD is just the sound or is enhanced. I could have spent the 8 dollars on something I would enjoy rather than regret
4,"Atmosphere Light GS-4A3 (Red,Green,Blue)","Just got 1 set. Here to buy a 2nd. Overpaid for the first set. $47.99 is a good price for the set of 3.Well made. Love the light bulbs (xmas lights). Great on/off switch. Holds the charge while off.Great size. 1 set is enough to brighten a 10x10 area, but 2 sets would be perfect."
1,Unwatchable,"I was so disappointed in this. Regardless of the content, the audio must be in sync with video, but especially with music. I had previously viewed the VHS release several years ago and I don't recall it displaying this problem. I believe it must have been in making the DVD and it is simply unconscionable to release a product, especially from a high level artist without paying attention to the small details. In the profit scheme this production task would not have taken very long to correct. It's bad enough that I'd feel ripped off it I bought it for a buck at a garage sale. Maybe there are versions of this out there that are better, as I watched a couple of the videos on YouTube first, assuming they came from this DVD. They appeared fine, so I ignored other reports of audio sync issues. Buyer beware."
1,dissapointing,watched about ten minutes then gave up on the out of sync video and audioi'm an ardent fan but this is a waste of money.should never have been released like this
3,Nice DVD for JT Fans,"This DVD was nice, except it could have been longer. Home location, barn setting was nice, serene images and laid back style. JT is great at this type of thing and the fans should love this. I was hoping for more side interviews from him... personal stuff, maybe him commenting on his home scenery and personal tidbits on his songs... still very nice."
3,Better next time !,Having all the other DVD's ... This one is too static.. not a great sound.Better stay with the others.. like the Tribute one ! Musicare album is super !
1,A drag!,I remeber seeing this on PBS years ago and was very excited to have it in my collection. The audio and video are waaaay out of sync and it's a real drag to watch. Got burned on this one. Makes for a good listen with the picture turned off!
3,disappointed,"I never send anything back but I am sending this book back. I was very disappointed in the content of the book. A portion of it was from 'The Early Years' which was a bit dated for me. And I am just not really a fan of the Sater style...for high-end custom homes, they look a bit canned in places. Anyway, if you are a fan of this builder and just want a pictorial of his work, this is the book for you. If you are trying to get ideas for a home I would move on to something else."
3,il magnificio,"I have to disagree with your man above. I think Ennio did the best he could with a bad lot. The guy above ignores the fact that De Palma (a very hit-and-miss director in my view) and Morricone have collaborated to excellent effect before in The Untouchables. And that was excellent. As it is, big movies ask for big scores, and this would have been better with somebody like Craig Armstrong on it instead. But you can't say that Ennio Morricone has done a bad job. I grew up with his music around me as I was fascinated by Leone's movies. I do wish Morricone would make some less orchestrated pieces again..."
1,Amazingly bad score from a recognized composer!,"Many people that have seen the film ""Mission to Mars"" said they hated it, but could not exactly point out why... Well, the reason is the horrendous score by Ennio Moriconne! What were both DePalma and Moriconne thinking? There are scenes in the movie that have some impact potential, yet the score makes them laughable! It's as if Moriconne messed up the recordings and gave M2M the wrong score! The movie would be much better if it was re-released with a different score... Some people reported that the score performs well on its own merits, but when I heard the album at a friend's house I found it bland, tired and unimaginative."
4,Music From Mars,"I haven't given this CD 5 stars simply because Mr Morricone's standards are sky high anyway. So it won't go down as one of his best, but this score is still better than most. Sometimes dramatic, sometimes beautiful but always interesting, theres even a hint of The Thing in there. I haven't seen the movie."
3,Teeny Tiny Sheepie,"When I bought this little sheepie he was called a hugging sheep. He is absolutely adorable, but too tiny for anyone bigger than a gerbil to hug.Why isn't he bigger?For his size he seems overpriced, but maybe I'm used to cheap goods mass-produced? I don't remember noticing where he was made."
3,Hot Air Styler Feedback,"I've been a long time user of the Revlon hot air curler dryers. I will continue to use them. I have had to replace some because the brush portion can be removed to either change the brush size or just to dry the hair without the brush. I think that portion of the mechanism is a little vulnerable to breakage over time. Also, I did not receive the same item as shown in the photo. It's still good but misrepresenting (style #). I would recommed this item. It's not great for thick hair. It't perfect for fine to medium thickness. I have sort hair and it works great!!!"
2,Not so hot... literally,"This particular hot air brush doesn't get hot enough. It works OK, it should just get hotter! If you have curly hair and are planning to use this product, don't bother. It may work better on straight hair, but I can not attest to this."
1,Poorly made,"The fact that this brush rotates freely and has an interchangeable head is the downfall of this product. The heads just snap on and off, and they have flimsy plastic teeth to keep them in place. So, when it is in your hair it will actually snap off while you are using it.Also, the thing that keeps it from rotating is made out of plastic, so when you are running it through your hair, it will start clicking a little and rotating slightly even though you aren't pushing the button.Please don't waste your money on this. I have been using this type of blow dry brush for 7 years and this is the first one I've had a problem with. I replaced it withRevlon RV446 1200W Ion Select Ceramic Hot Air Kitwhich works well (but is a little too loud) and Conair also sells some nice ones."
3,Too much Air Blowing,Too much air blowing the hair around...not able to get a good curl because of this functuion. I prefer the previous Revelon hot air styler that I purchased a few years ago with a smaller barrell..it was easier for me to handle.
3,Item not as pictured,"When I received the item, it was not as pictured. The base of the barrel on the brush portion looks sealed/closed when actually the smaller one has vents which allow hot air to escape and blow your hair while trying to style it. Not what I was looking for. Was hoping to receive the one in the picture."
1,I don't think it's new as claimed,"Is this package really new as the print-out white label claims? Anyone can put that label on. It was not in a box as the picture showed, it came in a plastic see-through bag. It doesn't even have instructions as a new product would have. I am dissatisfied!"
3,almost perfect,"Revlon RV444C Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic, Blackseveral years ago my daughter baught one of these to try out; from that moment on I was hooked, it did everything I needed it to do to get the job done beautifully. Unfortunately it soon burned out. Again; not too long after the perchase of my secound as well as the third styler the bristles receded into the barrel. I have tried others but none seem to do the job as well. In my opinion, they need to fix this issue, minimumly make the brushes available as a separate perchase."
2,Already broken,"I bought this hair dryer about 3 months ago. It has 3 heat settings, cool, low, and high. I've noticed for the past few days that the low setting was not making contact some of the time. Today the low setting cut out completely, and I can only use the dryer on the cool or high settings. I would return this dryer immediately, but I don't have the receipt. I like this type of hair dryer because it makes it easier to work with my hair, but Revlon makes a lousy product."
5,Love This Product!,"Revlon Thermalaire Ceramic Hot Air Styler/Dryer - RV444CI use this hot air styler/dryer everyday. I've owned two other Revlon hot air styler/dryer over the years & loved both of them, just as I love this one. The ceramic heat on the 444C is not as damaging as metal stylers and the two brush barrels change easily for large or small curls. I have small hands, & this one is easy for me to use."
1,Difficult to use; does not curl; does not dry,Hate it but could not return it as I dont want to pay for the mailing cost
1,NOT HOT ENOUGH,"I have very thick straight hair and usually dry it then use the curling iron. This blow dryer is not hot enough to dry my hair, even if I take small strands at a time. It doesn't seem to curl my hair either. I guess I will try to dry it with a regular blow dryer most of the way then try and curl it with the brush, which will defeat the purpose of why I bought it. Also, I've switched brushes a couple times and now the brush falls off while I am blow drying my hair. I feel I waisted my money. Another product I won't use."
2,Why did they change a great product?,"I have owned one of these Hot Air Stylers for many, many years and thought I should replace it with a new model.What a mistake!!! The handle on this Styler is so large you can not get your hand around it. I suppose a large man could get a good grip but I have never seen a women's hand large enough to fit around it. The next thing you will notice is the fact it does not get as hot as the old model. Even worse is that air blows out of vents at the bottom of the brush in the top of the handle so your hair is blowing all over the place.The only good thing is that it is much more quiet than the older model. Maybe I am just too set in my ways but I would love to have my old model back."
3,cheap,"this product is very cheap in the making of it. But it is the right size I needed, clients still bought it anyway."
1,Dissapointed in my Hot air brush,Don't waste your money!!! The air blows out of a small hole and it takes forever to dry my hair and its NOT that thick!! Last week It burnt out!Now it doesnt work! Total waste of money!!!
1,Just plain awful...,"There's a reason why this thing is so cheap: it doesn't work. It doesn't spin at all, so either the spin button is broken, or something inside the mechanism is busted. Perhaps I got a defective one; all I know is that it doesn't work. I did get the ""hot air"" part to work, but I agree with other reviewers that it seems like the air flow isn't strong enough (nor hot enough) to dry and curl your hair.Also, Amazon sent me this thing in a plastic case with absolutely NO documentation or instruction manual with it. Since this thing was so cheap, I don't want to spend the time or $ to send it back for a refund, so I'll probably just pitch it. So buyer beware: don't waste your money on this thing!"
1,new design terrible,When purchasing this on Amazon the photo is of the OLD model which was what I was loooking for. Not helpful when you are sent the new model which I could have purchased locally. The new design of this product does not allow it to be used as it was prior to this change. Air flow is newly directed and unable to achieve desired reults of older models. Then the website did not allow me to return the product - only exchange. Had to spend two phone calls and numberous explanations to accomplish returning...not a pleasant experience and still not able to find the older model.
1,Revelon RV444C Hot Air Styler & Dryer,It was very poor quality. Kept turning while using and afraid it was going to fall off. The button to turn it off and on stuck more than once and now is completely stuck! I bought two and am returning them both!!
4,revlon RV444C hot air styler,This product works well on fine straight hair. It gives the look of a fuller head of hair. I have used Revlon styling brushes for years. Still like the old model that did not blow air through the brush. It seemed to work better for me.
1,Disappointing,"I only got 2 months of use out of this product, which I bought at a local store. After that short time, it would only heat for a minute or less before the heating element turned off and it blew only cool air. Fortunately, I was able to return it to the store for a refund. It wasn't very expensive, but 2 months is absurd. Won't buy this brand again, that's for sure."
2,wrong product than advertized,"I see they have changed what was originally advertized. The original item stated ...Ceramic, Black and Purple, which was the style my wife loved. I ordered two, due to the fact that it is an older model, and Revlon said that Amazon bought all their stock. The one's recieved were ...Ceramic, Black and Red, which my wife has currently and does not like. Needless to say, they were sent back for a refund"
1,Does Not Work,"I orderd this item, despite the bad reviews i read. All the bad reviews i read were correct. The barrel does not spin as described, in fact, you press the button and it does absolutely nothing. I returned the 1st one, acepted the replacement, and sure enough the 2nd one did not spin either. This product should be removed from the market. Waste of time. Gave it one star becuase you cant put zero stars."
3,Doesn't rotate...,"Bought this yesterday and couldn't wait to open it and try it out this morning. Right out of the packaging it doesn't rotate AT ALL! Looks like I have to send it back for a replacement :( Hopefully in a few weeks when I get the replacement that one works!Aside from not rotating I really like the product...the barrel gets hot enough to create some curl and it does have a smoothing effect. I wouldn't use this on wet hair, the ""blow dryer"" function is a bit weak!"
2,Boo! Hiss!,"I had a way older model just like this one that was fantastic!The rotate button was so easy to use BUT on this one it is anabsolute joke, not to mention the brushes WILL NOT stayon the wand. Into the garbage it goes!"
2,Revlon 440C Hot Air Dryer and Styler,This item has too little wattage to achieve the straight (no curl) effect I want. Perhaps the manufacturer assumes the customer understand the difference between wattage and styling. I did not. It would have been helpful if more information had been included in the description.
1,Just wrong,"I have used a similar item for years until the heating element broke in it. I bought this one to replace it and was horribly dissappointed. The air flow is so weak that you HAVE to use another dryer to dry your hair before you can use this to curl your ends. The barrel loses its grip with the slightest resistance, which means that every time you hit a tangle the barrel rolls and straightens your hair instead of curling it and you have to take the dryer and push the barrel back on it. And then it broke after only 3 weeks of use. What a waste of money! I will keep looking for the old model that I used."
1,used,"I did not order a used brush/dryer, but it arrived with a large scratch on one portion and there were hairs in the smaller brush attachment!!! I wasn't happy."
1,It broke after 2 uses!,"I got this because I thought it would cut my time in half when blow drying my hair. Here is why I give it only one star:1. The first thing that I noticed is that there is not a lot of power behind it, but it did add shine which I liked. 2. The first time I used it, both barrels came out as I was using it. I have kind of thick hair so i always separate it into smaller sections so as not to overpower any tool I'm using, but this couldn't take even small amounts without falling out of the dryer.3. It is supposed to spin, but even before I ever put it to my head, it never spun. The only think it did was loosen if it got tangled in my hair4. The second time I used it the barrel split in half in the middle of using it, again on a small section of hairOverall a good idea, but poor quality. Frankly i expect more from Revlon."
1,it didnt work!,the hair dryer/curler looked used and it had hair rolled on it...it said it was new on the amazon review. The barrol didnt even spin!
1,This thing should be recalled!,"This Revlon product should be recalled. The barrels don't stay in while you are drying your hair. I've even had them fly out across the room. I'd return it, but I don't know where the receipt is."
3,"It's OK, not Great","Sucker for the REVLON name ... I thought this to be a sidekick and possible replacement for an OLD Vidal Sassoon hair dryer/styler kit that's no longer available. This definitely is geared more to curling with it's cool temperature for setting a curl. But it doesn't put out enough heat to quickly rough dry my hair while finger combing. This is so cheaply made I'm hoping it lasts until I can find a dryer/styler I like better. I don't think this would survive many trips in ""checked"" luggage. I'm still looking for a hair dryer/styler that is more solidly manufactured with more power, a concentrator and durable brushes.For now it's passable, but REVLON should be ashamed to have it's name on it. Eventhough, BOTH my Vidal Sassoon and this one are made by Helen Of Troy in China, this is very inferior. Before you ask, the attachments are NOT interchangeable with my Sassoon."
1,PIECE OF JUNK! Can't believe Revlon would put their name on this product. Don't waste your money.,"Very weak hair dryer and the barrel never would seat properly. I only bought the RV444 because the store did not have the RV440C. Just found my receipt so I can try to get my money back.A much better choice for about the same price: Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue.None of them seem to last more than a year or two but they are easy to use."
2,Totally Cheap Redesign,"My previous Revlon 444c hot air brush just died after about two years so I bought the same model again-- but the new 444c is a total redesign and not what is pictured on Amazon's website. The newer model has fewer rows of bristles in the brush (much smaller surface area) and the handle base is not only fatter but constructed of really cheap and flimsy plastic. The brush attachment is a little wobbly too. Compared to the previous model, I don't think this one is going to last 6 months. I've lost loyalty to Revlon now. Pay attention corporations--I'd rather pay MORE money for a better quality item!"
3,Does the job,"I've used several hot air brushes. This is not my favorite, but definitely not the worst. I prefer ones that have bristles like this one as opposed to hard plastic. It grabs my hair better.This one has an interchangeable head. However, I only use the large part. The pieces move and pop off too easily, so I glued the large rod in place. Works like a charm now! :)The on/off switch is a little touchy. Also, wish it got hotter on 'Low', so my hair wouldn't get so many fly aways."
4,Good Choice...,"My other (brand) hot hair brush is the 'comb style' type; this is my first 'brush style'. My preference is the harder comb style over the brush style. It seems hair type, thickness, etc. would certainly play a big factor - my hair is thick and course.This brush style works... it smooths hair, adds volume, and curl; it just takes a bit more effort to 'hold the hair' or get 'through the hair' because the brush bristles are not strong enough to go through thick hair.This is a very good choice, I am not disappointed in this product. If you have thick or course hair, understand that you should use smaller sections for styling; for 'lift' - just holding the curling brush under the hair close to the scalp works pretty good...Bad side... If you don't pay attention, your hair will get caught in between the removeable brush and handle."
4,"Great features, but power switch may be a problem.","I have owned this product for the past few months. I love the brush sizes and that they are interchangeable. Great tool for loosening curly hair for a softer look. The quick curl-release is great. It also has several temperature settings . . . low/high heat and cool for setting the curl. The barrels also cool down fairly quickly after use.My only complaint is the plastic power switch. It pops off at times and is tempermental about making a connection at start-up and switching the temperature settings. It may just be my unit or could be a flaw in the product. Check out the switch before purchase, if possible.I paid only $17.00 + tax at Walmart. I am looking for a similar product with the same features but sturdier construction. This one is not worth $30+."
3,No easy way to clean,"All in all, I do like this product. But my one big gripe is that you can't clean it. Before I use the Hot Air Styler to dry my hair, I put some mousse in it. Eventually, because of continual use and heat, reside will build up on the bristles of the brush part. This is natural. The problem is that you can't clean it off very well.The best way to get the brush clean was to unscrew the casing and take out the brush. Then soak and wash/rinse and replace. But when you try to replace it, there is absolutely no way to get all the bristles back into the holes. I would LOVE this product if there was a convenient way to clean the brush! Otherwise you're going to want to chuck it and buy a new one every couple of years. Hmmm, maybe that's Revlon's goal. You never know."
2,Does not last long!,"I bought this hot air brush at KMart, its the only one they have with a larger size barrel. This is the third one I bought in a less than a 2 year period. I use it daily, and it gives great results. However, it does not last more than 4-6 months. The point at which it breaks each and every time is where 2 flimsy screws are attached to the barrel. I am now looking here at Amazon to find a different brand, for when my current airbrush breaks I will not buy another Revlon one. If it wasn't for the barrel breaking off so soon after purchase I'd give it 5 stars."
1,Rotating Barrell ###%@%^&&,"I have had a half a dozen of these hair dryers over the years before they introduced the rotating barrel ""feature"". This is THE most annoying thing you can imagine. It is impossible to control once it starts spinning and it is impossible to keep it locked in so that it doesn't spin. This product is the only thing I know that can make me curse first thing in the morning. I was so happy with the old hair dryers without this ""feature"". I have switched to a similar product by Conair."
3,packaging,I've read that you are trying to get manufacturers to come up with some other packaging for products they sell thru Amazon - please don't give up - this tough plastic enclosing the product is horrible to deal with.
2,It broke apart in 30 days,"It worked Ok for drying and smoothing my thin, straight hair, but not great. It blows air from the handle, not from the bristles holding the hair, The hair not wrapped around the bristles flies away because of this. It was not the best hot air brush design I have used. 30 days after purchase, the barrel broke from the handle, so now it is useless. I do not recommend this hot air brush."
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"I thought that this book would have provided more detailed information on corporate administration. It just provides samples of various sample forms etc that one may use. I guess that this is helpful to some persons who are looking specifically for that sort of thing but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. Since I have already bought the book, I will refer to it from time to time to see if there's anything applicable to an area that I'm working on."
4,An excellent book for the young reader.,"Join the net force explorers in their latest adventure when something is amuck at the local fencing studio.This series of books is aimed at the younger reader and as such tend to be easy books to read. Even so they keep you coming back for more and it's hard to put them down once you start.This was a good paced book, easy to read, yet captivating at the same time. This one is worth the money, buy it today you won't be disappointed."
3,It's o.k.,"Overall I like the product, but there are two concerns I have. The alarm buzzer is not that loud and the knobs for volume and tuning are not easy to turn as they do not have a lot o texture for you finger to connect. I love it's sleekness and size. My last system took up half of my nightstand."
3,Shipping,"Its exactly what I was looking for. However, 1-2 weeks shipping is a ridiculous amount of time to wait to get this item. In todays market it should not take any longer than 1-2 days."
5,THE BEST,"If I were a billionaire I would buy this company outright.Every product is delicious, particularly this one."
2,Funny smell,"I love Dermatologica products--except this one. The lotion is moisturizing, but I could not tolerate the smell so I returned it. I also don't think it's worth the money."
5,top quality,"Best to have at hand for note writing and lists.... love the color green, not so run-of-the-mill. Quality paper in a size that is perfect as the post-it squares just don't provide enough surface writing area. Very pleased and am on the second bulk order."
4,NICE PRODUCT - BUT TOO PRICEY,"These legal pads are a very good product, but pricey. If I could have gotten away with white or yellow I would have purchased those at Costco or Sams for a small fraction of what I paid for these, but for the project I was working on, I needed green."
4,UNDER THE WIRE,"On this one Trent Gardners voice is sounding like John Andersonon steroids and the drum machine pounds away sounding likeangry barking dogs but this is still a very good solid CD.You will need to put some hours in at your local libraryto know what the songs are about and it has a steep listeningcurve but all in all I like it....... The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, strategems, and spoils; The motions of his spirit are as dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus. Let no such man be trusted. (William Shakespeare)"
4,Well I like it!,"I bought their debut by chance and was hooked. My very first heavy prog purchase. So I had high hopes for Impending. Well after a few listens I nearly dumped it, but gradually the material began to come through. Estadium Nationale, Waterfront Wierdos at 11 minutes each exceed the quality on thier debut. Storms & Mutiny (the other epic) is more difficult to get into, but is a great song after the first frenetic few minutes. Songsmith and Under The Wire are forgettable. I can see why Magellan gets such polarized opinions. You either love them or hate them. Subsequently, Test Of Wills and 100 Year Flood are not to my taste."
2,Save your cash -- there's better prog,"I started listening to Magellan because they were a source of progressive rock that I hadn't already exhausted, and which was available in stores. That was really before internet shopping took off. Now I don't have to listen to them any more. Half the time the lyrics are like a book report, half the time like a request for donations from some leftish organization. And can't they find a real drummer?One star for guitars, one for keys."
4,I like it.....it's good progressive rock.,"Hey man, don't knock it if you can't do it. Magellan can do it! They can groove, rock, and jam....so, what's the big beef? Imitation is the best compliment, as it were, but I don't think Magellan is really imitating anyone. I think they are the inheritors of Gentle Giant, more than YES. They are and original group, and do quite well on their own. This was the first recording I had been exposed to of theirs, as a result of the tribute to yes cd performance(a friend had turned me on to them, again, my buddy Boone). It took me a few listenings to get into it.....and my favorite track is ""storms and mutiny"", as it couples my passion for music with my passion for history. I also like ""Waterfront Weirdos"" as well.....as it points out the injustice and tragedy of homeless people.Hey, it's a good effort.....4 out of 5 stars.--JZ"
3,Bombastic Impression!,"Oke, well. You can say we've heard it all before and it sounds like a mix from Yes/ELP/King Crimson and Dream Theater but what the hell. These 3! guys make bombastic, heavy keyboard dominated sympho rock. The lyrics are not that great and sometimes didn't seem to fit in, but the whole album itselff gave me no bad feeling and was very interesting to listen to. It's the first time I heard an album of them but I will certainly look for more. The mechanical drumming didn't bother me, but it would be nice i've they tried to find one of flesh and blood. It will sure add a more humanly touch to their music. I rate 3 stars. They have to try to find a more identity of themselves."
3,"Nothing special, but still better than most mainstream horror flicks","Calling Dead in 3 Days a German take on I Know What You Did Last Summer would pretty much sum up all there is to know about this film, with the only exception being that Dead in 3 Days is far superior, and in reality despite the many horror/slasher conventions it follows, is better than a majority of mainstream American horror flicks. The film follows around a group of attractive grads who all receive a text message telling them, you guessed it, they'll be dead in 3 days. Before you know it, they're being picked off one by one by a hooded killer. There's some decent gore, and even some decent scares to be found in Dead in 3 Days, as well as some gorgeous cinematography as well. Other than that, Dead in 3 Days doesn't offer anything that you haven't seen countless times before, but the film is still worth a look at the very least for die hard slasher fans."
3,Austrian Slasher Flick.,Not much different from American slasher flicks. There will be a sequel. A couple off good scenes.
3,Great CDs....not worth 70 bucks,"These Schoolhouse Rock songs are absolutely phenominal except that there is NO way I would ever spend 70 dollars each for them. I used to have these CDs and I bought them for like 13 dollars each brand new. For some reason, they now are no longer available except online for a very hefty price. I will be glad to buy these albums if the prices are ever lowered, but 70 bucks? For a CD with 9 songs? That is ridiculous. These prices need to be lowered big time."
5,Great Series,The Schoolhouse Rock Series is one of the most creative and educational music and video recordings ever! My kids were raised on the TV broadcasts and Multiplication Rock LP and now my grandson can see the cartoons and learn the songs. This is wonderful stuff. Highly recommended.
2,Wolo 3015-BR Hawkeye 4 Clear Lens,This light is good for night time use but for use in daylight it can't be seen any distance it is not any good for use in the daytime would never buy this light again wanted a light that i could use in the daytime as well as the dark with the use of the Blue or just use the Red light when i need to and the red and blue together is great as long as you use it at night.
1,not very good light,manufacturer has a good idea but the design of the clear exterior lens is poor. the light is not visible in daylight and is nothing like other led lights at night either. could be changed and made a lot better.
3,Songs are OK but no pause in between tracks,I like about 2/3 of the songs while the rest are so so. What I don't like about this album is that there is no pause between tracks which sounds a bit strange if you are just listening and not dancing to it.
2,best dance hits,Was looking for a good workout mix. This album is compiled of slow songs remixed to club beats. Not inspiring. Songs also from early 90s. Came in good condition though. Just wasn't what I wanted
5,My Review,"I bought this CD, and I loved it! This CD I would recommend this cd to all Dance Teachers, who need some music for there dance rectials. Everyone will love it to, It's great music for people taking jazz dancing!"
4,collection of guitar wizard's best work,"Fans of Leo Kottke will have all these tunes already. This is a showcase for Kottke's remarkable technique and innovation on 6 and 12 string guitars, and his droning unforgettable voice."
5,great read!,"I picked up this book based on a bookseller's recommendation and loved it so much that it moved me to write my very first Amazon review.The writing is sharp; several passages had me laughing out loud (how many books do that?). The characters are quirky yet real. Despite their absurd situations, they are very human.My favorite parts of the novel are when Ellenberg weaves Gravinic fairy tales, past history/legend, and (surprisingly) heated games of checkers into the plot. The twin questions of How do I know this is the person I want to marry? and What do I want to do with my life? are also part of the story, a bit more mundane but very real for most people.This is one of those books where you enjoy the ride and don't want it to end."
3,The book is alright not what I exspected from the series,The book was filled with the funny family I have come to love. The books plot and story left somthing to the imagination. The story at various times was slow moving and draged on. The story still keep your intrest but you had to skip pages to get to the point which was dragged on for two pages when it only needed one. I liked the story but wouldnt read it again.
4,Old School Gung Fu Flick,This is one of Gordon Liu's movies that encouraged me to take up weapons. The fighting scenes are excellent and the Shaolin is very good. There is a fighting scene were Liu Kar Liang and Gordon square off. Its just spectacular. This is a Must See Movie.A Kung Fu Instructor's sun wishes his father would teach him martial arts but he doesn't because the young man [Gordon Liu] is to hot headed. But an expert takes him in as a student and he learns in 3 years and the rest is Great Kung Fu! Get this one Now!
1,Too Expensive,"I'm not sure if there was a typo, but the price doesn't seem right. I got it for less than $20 bucks and it says here that the price is over $100. Check out the French version and you'll see that the price is not supposed to be that high. I'd look for this book elsewhere"
4,"Solid board, good quality paper","The TOPS Docket Gold Legal Ruled Pad features 20lbs quality paper as well as super sturdy board in the back, making it very comfortable writing holding just the pad without a clipboard.I use these for taking reading notes."
1,Used Bulk Paper,Quality paper but it arrived unbundled in bulk. Some pads were: dirty from box grit; had blurred lines from water exposure; and looked like someone had scribbled on the top page and tore it off. Yuck!
5,Very Nice Ring,"This is one my fave rings. It comes with a string around it so it won't fall a part when you take it out of the box & it will fall apart when the string comes off. It will fall apart when you take it off unless you are very careful, but it is one of the easist puzzle rings I have.I love this ring & the company has a video you can watch & learn to how to put it, & other puzzle rings, back together. The indviual bands are thin & can bend so you have to be nice it, but it is well worth the money."
4,What you see is what you get-design wise,"I was looking for something different, and figured I found it. I have no celtic heritage, and a lot of the weave style rings seem to point that way. I was really pleased with the ring and dealing with silver insanity- it was really fast shipping. Shortly after I got it, however, my curiousity got the best of me and I took it apart. It sat on my dresser about a week before I remembered it and decided to find a solution. I was NOT given instructions, but I looked up ""puzzle ring"" on youtube and found a solution. So glad I did, because now I have a functioning ring.If you buy this ring, don't take it apart unless you're prepared to spend some time in front of the computer."
3,No Graphics,"Perhaps it is my fault for not reading the product description or reviews more thoroughly, but I was disappointed when I received this product to see a sticker on the front of the cd case which said ""no graphics."" The song selections are good, and the children at our event still had a good time singing these well-know songs. However, because this cd has no graphics, the words to the songs are not displayed on the screen."
3,Big Chunks,"Chunks were larger than my dog was used to, and he didn't tolerate this food well. My dog is elderly though, so I have a poor sample from which to judge."
5,loved by dog,"I can't seem to find this dog food anywhere else. Price fluctuates, but I hardly notice since I've got this in my subscribe and save!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Green Lantern: Emerald Knights is yet another of the bring Hal Jordan back so we can use him type of stories.This time, he is again hanging out with Kyle Rayner, and ends up opposing his future self, among other things. Muchness of green stuff to be found here."
4,My hair likes this oil,"This could have been one of my staple oils because it works well in my hair, but I think I may stick to hemp and coconut oil."
5,happy with the purchase,"clear odorless oil, i use it as body oil and massage oil.good product! totally worth the $$ :)"
5,great product! - and super fast delivery,"This is the best natural oil for making moisturizer, scalp and skin treatment or for burning fragrant oils. Fast delivery too!"
5,Grape Seed Oil ROCKS,Arrived quickly and in great condition. Love using this product daily before applying my make-up and at night after taking off my make-up. My skin loves it! Also use on my hands and feet. Excellent quality from Now Foods.
4,Grape Seed Oil,It appears this oil works pretty well in sealing my hair and not giving the stringy or greasy feel some oils seem to do in my hair.
4,Love grape seed oil,I love grape seed oil and have been using it for a long while. This one is fine and besides being a little on the pricey side a great buy. thanks
4,liked it,"I liked the way it looked and the bottle felt, looked like a glass but was plastic and not that heavy. the only down thing is that I'm not sure if this product is a cold press or not, and not sure if it can effect the result while using it on skin or not, might be more important for eating I guess. I'm mixing it with coco butter lotion and vitamin E, sometimes rose hips before use and sometimes alone and so far been happy about it."
3,NOW Grapeseed Oil,"I am usually very happy with NOW products, but this one I have concerns about. The description or bottle doesn't say whether it is expeller pressed or pressed with hexane or another chemical. Most reputable products will have this information listed. I wonder if this has been processed in a way that is detrimental to the quality of the product. It does make a great skin moisturizer. You can find organic grapeseed oil for much cheaper on other web sites."
3,"i love this product, but ..","i love this product but i would not buy it again because the description or bottle doesn't say whether it is expeller pressed or pressed with hexane or another chemical. The other now product oils that are expeller pressed brag about it, and this one doesn't mention it which makes me curious."
5,Grapeseed Oil,Arrived in good time. I add this oil to my body lotions and its make it that much better.
1,Moisturiser...,"I use grape seed oil as a moisturiser not as a cooking oil since nothing comes close to extra virgin olive oil in cooking and health. I purchased this when Costco was not selling any grape seed oil... It is a great moisturiser, only second to almond oil for the price and certainly not for the price that NOW FOODS is charging these days. After all it is no better than Kirkland's grape seed oil which is priced around $8.50 for 68 ounces, from a trusted source. But more importantly Now Foods grape seed oil certainly did not feel any better on my skin either. Ridiculous pricing, four times more expensive. Now Foods needs to get realistic."
2,It is what it is!,"This oil is just like any other oil. It is slick, greasy, and not quickly absorbed when applied to the skin. I was also hoping to be able to cook with it, but the label promotes its skin conditioning abilities and only threw in one line about its edibleness. On here, it is marketed as Now Foods; however, the label that is on the bottle says Now Solutions. I am a bit confused. I will continue using it only on my skin and hair, but probably won't purchase it again."
5,Caution: Slippery when wet,"High quality oil, big value for the price. Quick shipping. Very happy with this product. A little goes a long way. Will shop here again."
2,terribly disappointed,"After buying the day and night creams, I was terribly disappointed. I hated the feel of this cream/serum. Maybe I'm using it wrong, everybody else seems to like it. I tried it for two weeks, and after it finally dried it left a sticky, filmy layer on my skin."
5,Wonderful oil at a wonderful price!,"I purchased this to use as lotion along with essential oils. Perfect family size and light, absorbs well. My son also has toddler eczema and this keeps his skin happy! Great item! (Perfect for babies too!)."
3,light and moisturizing,"I purchased this as a waterproof eye makeup remover.Although it does take off the makeup (as with any oil), itirritated my eyes. At bedtime, my eyes would water profusely.I was surprised, since it's supposed to be so pure and light.May not clog pores, but take care around the eyes. But I do pat thison a damp face when my skin gets dry and flaky (I actually have oily skin).Does do a good job with making skin soft and non-greasy."
5,Must Have!,I won't write a long review but if your not one for greasey and heavy oils then pick up this oil. I've been using it for a year and adore how lightweight it feels on my hair and face. Has to be my favorite oil I've ever used.
4,surveys all Neumann's churches,"For the scholar of medieval architecture, Otto's study of Neumann can be enjoyable. The author analysed Neumann's churches that he carefully designed. The discourse is quite detailed and really best appreciated by someone already conversant in this field.The book also includes a set of colour plates of the exteriors and interiors of several surviving churches of Neumann's design. But note that the narrative does not confine itself to existing churches. For those lost to the ravages of time, Otto has plumbed what documents are available, to reconstruct their layout."
2,Battery for cam corder,"Advertised as a replacement for NP-FP70. Would not work in Sony Cam corder that takes NP-FP70 Batteries. It charged up ok, but the camera would give a message to use lithium type battery and turn off. Help!"
1,Did not work,I bought these to replace the original batteries that came with my Sony Handycam. They are exatly the same batteries it came with in 2003 but they would not work in my camcorder or in my charger.Returning item.
3,Old School,This is an old text book that is good as a historical review of how they did it 40 years ago before LDH. If you own an old pumper this book is a good reference source too.
3,Entertaining,"A good read if you are already into the series, but not the book to sell you on the series.The parallels between this series and the Hornblower series are deliberate, although Honor leans more toward the main character of Perils of Pauline than H. Hornblower. But Honor is as tough as sharkskin and as cagey as a Sackett when it comes to taking punishment and maneuvering her opponents into acts that will ruin their day.David Weber has clearly used the conflicts between England and France in the 18th and 19th centuries as the outline for this series. But that's all right! He does it quite well and the series is internally consistent. Mr. Weber is doing us a great service in continuing this series. We can do no less than buy his books to reward him."
3,Calvary to Honor's Rescue!,"Honor finally loses bad. Not only is she captured, but she is sentenced to be executed by the head of the Peep's Bureau of Comunications. She also loses sight in one eye, and is dependent upon others for everything. What I loved about this book is how David makes the truly evil bad guys believable, and that there could be very good guys fighting for the Peep's. An excellent yarn with plenty of good sub-plots to keep you up all night. What I like about this series is David's views on politics and military stratagies."
2,A terrible disappointment,"Very unlike David Weber. This book is incomplete. Most of Weber's work is both great, rollicking reading and literarily sound. Generally, if you open to the middle of one of his books you find the middle of the story it tells. Not so in In Enemy Hands. The center of this story is about 50 pages from the end, plus it doesn't so much end as simply stop. It reeks of ""editor says print now, give me what you've got."" DO NOT read this book unless you have the next one waiting."
4,great light reading,"hey, this is really great light reading. Good is good and bad is bad: the good guys on the good side win, the bad guys on the bad side lose, and the good guys on the bad side do the right thing.I've read all of them, and I'll read the rest. This series is as good (albeit about two levels down) a read as the nautical series by O'Brien."
3,great story hidden within excessive prose,"Exciting action, interesting characters and social conditions along with the whiz-bang SF that is well integrated into the story made this an interesting read in spite of the author's excessive prose. I found myself skimming frequently to get to the next block of action or dialogue. This was my first read of this author and I intend to try his other work."
3,Picks up at the end,"The author spends too much time in characters' heads. Conceivably this could be interesting but not here. About 1/4 of the way through I got fed up and skipped over about half of the book, reading only a paragraph here and there. However the last third or quarter is so riveting that I stayed up 2 hours too late simply to finish it, and the next day I bought the book that comes after this one. My general impression of Weber books is that they start slowly, filling in character, but they accelerate, so that at the end they are very exciting and moving - it's the endings that keep me coming back. Same occurs here, but the beginning of the book is too slow."
3,Not his best!,"I am a real Weber fan, but large parts of this book are somewhat dull. Never thought that I would say that about a Weber book. Large chunks are devoted to convincing you that being the head of a sucessful coup is dangerous and inconvienent, go figure. All is not lost. This book is a modified cliffhanger, and the next one should be great."
2,Tired of the lectures,"OK, I read a lot of science fiction, especially military SF. The first few books in the Honor Harrington series were a wonderful homage to Horatio Hornblower and a nice bit of fresh air in space opera. Books 1 through 3 were quite good, 4 through 6 OK, and then I was sorely disappointed by this one.The story was OK; the plot was OK; the development of the overarching series as a whole was OK. What was NOT ok was the fact that Weber descended into so many author filibusters that it A) felt like a full 1/3 of the book was Weber telling me I am not concerned enough with the plight of women and B) I wanted to stop reading the darn book. In the end I finished it, but Weber's ridiculous screeds almost put me off the entire series."
3,"In Enemy Hands - more of the same, but not as good","This was my least favorite of the Honor Harrington series. The characters were even more cardboard in depth than previous novels.Someone else's review said ""everyone that is good is good and everyone that is bad is bad"". I agree completely.Now, I like the Harrington series, but maybe more for the combat scenes than I had realized (which were very few in this book)"
3,Wait for the other half of the book!,"I love Honor Harrington and the whole universe that David Weber has created. I especially like the rewards that he bestows upon the righteous endeavors and heroic activities of his leading characters. This story is only half done though. It is obviously a pre-quel to a second book in an already long saga of stories. It seems unfair to the fans to have to wait for months for the end of the story and pay double for the story. One other comment, David's villains are being drawn with to much attention to their horrid-ness. We don't need any more depravity in our recreational reading. Suffice that the bad guys are bad. Please don't go to such detail about how bad."
2,Skip this one and go on to the next book.,"OMG! This has to be one of Weber's worst of the series to date. Page after page after page of of blathering on and on about things not even remotely relevant to the story. I have read the previous 6 books in the series and was HUGELY dissapointed with this work. Save yourself the $$ and just remember the following. 1) Whitehaven has the hots (now) for Honor. 2)Honor surrenders to the Peeps 3) Some ""good"" Peeps help her escape. Skip this one and go on to the next book."
2,A disappointing Weber !,"Well, that's not so bad, six good books in a row ! I was wondering when it would start to decline. Weber's books used to be packed with actions or emotions, here we have a lot of unnecessary description of people and places instantly forgotten. I hope the (almost) only good space-opera writer will fight back in his following books."
2,Not as good as the others,"I loved all the Honor books before this one, but this one was just too boring! I guess he was setting it up for future books but nothing happened until the last 15% of the book. I'll try the next in the series, hopefully it will be back to the great story it was before this one."
4,A distinctly different book,"A very distinct departure in style for David Weber, in which something seriously bad actually happens to our heroine without there being a real happy ending. Granted, escaping from the hands of Ms. Ransom is a good turn, but being stuck on a prison planet is still bad. In fact, you really get the idea he's lifting some concepts from both history and 1986. A few books back, it took a while for me to get the allusion to Robespierre. Once you make the connection between Haven to the French Revolution, it becomes far more interesting."
5,"It's in the Honor Harrington Series, what more do you need?","Excellant book from an excellant series. Great action, interesting technologies, and fantastic characters. While obviously an us-verus-them from the West vs Communism perspective, the stories work, and catch back up. I love a good series, where, as in real life; everything connects. This book focusses somewhat on the repercussions of what happened ""On Basilisk Station"" - 6 books ago! Of course, the last book dealt with some of those repercussions as well. It's not ""thrown in"" either, as I said it works. I suggest not buying this book, but rather buying the entire series:)"
2,Average,This book is average. My daughter doesn't really like it...nothing in the book catches her attention.
1,This is a coloring book!,"They describe this as being a board book with great illustrations, but it's not. It's a coloring book! I was very disappointed when receiving this in the mail because we're big Eric Carle fans and I was expecting to find a book of his colorful characters and numbers. A real let down."
4,Great book to act out,My two year old loves this book. It's fun to watch each type of animal get aboard the zoo train. We make train noises and count the animals.
3,Not As Good As It Gets,"We are huge Eric Carle fans and found 1,2,3 To The Zoo disappointing. The drawings of the animals were great but a little description of activity would maintain the interest of the child. i.e 1 Bear is Jumping Up and Down, 2 Seals are clapping their hands, etc.We found the book very lacking and unmotivating for our daughter."
4,Make learning fun!,"I have always loved driving to the zoo on Wednesday when the entrance fee is waived, but I have never loved counting. This is exactly the sentiment my child expressed when I made my first attempts to teach him the single-digit numbers. Of course, such pursuits are hopeless at an early age until the child develops distinct fingers around his or her third birthday. When this happens, however, it is a very good idea to pull your child aside and teach him exactly what it means to live under a decimal numeral system. Be sure to have a book just like this one at hand. I would also suggest numbering multiple species, or like me you may find your larvae calling all bears ""one"" or seals ""two"". I'm sure someone else will set him aright."
3,Not much in this one,"This is one of Carle's books that are suited more for toddlers than older kids.There aren't many words, just a count of the various animals on their way to the zoo.Because of this, and because the book is oversized and hard to read/shelve, it may be better to buy this in board book format - or, given the minimal content, to skip it altogether."
5,Sad still lives,"Calm, respectful black and white photos of car crashes, taken in the 1950s and 60s by a Swiss police photographer.It's hard to explain why these images are so evocative and so much better than car crime TV shows and auto wreck websites.Apart from a few solemn bystanders, there aren't any people in the pictures. The stillness of them is particularly striking. No blood and guts -- only the stories implied by twisted metal and chalked-in skid marks.Highly recommended."
4,Neat book!,We purchased this as a book for homeschooling. It's written in a very entertaining way and filled with a lot of neat experiments and hands-on activities.
4,Students loved Blood and Guts,My students loved learning and reading about the information in this book and many other Brown Paper School Books. It sparked their interest to research many other aspects of the human body!
5,Excellent!,I LOVE this CD!!! The music is very gorgeous and it flows very well. It is a must have for every lover of Celtic and New Age music. The mix of instrumentals and vocals are nice!
2,SOME THINGS TASTE GOOD BUT BE WARNED!,Well I bought this book hoping that I could have more breakfast ideas especially now that my children are going to school full time and I dislike processed cereals. I am a domestic engineer who has studied culinary arts specializing in pasteries. All I have to say is that the recipes that I have tried taste alright but the timing is off. Some pancake recipes call for a little much baking powder that gives the hotcakes a soapy flavour.
5,Love It!!!,"I've been eating Cross & Blackwell's chow-chow since I was a child, and there's nothing like it and no replacement that I've found. It's impossible to buy in groceries where I live, but now I can buy it online! It's not quite as great as it was when I was younger, when it had whole pearl onions and largish chunks of cauliflower in it, but the taste is the same. It would be even better, though, if it were more as it was before. It's a great condiment."
3,Small Pieces,"As are all the previous Habba blocks I purchased this set is adorable, colorful, well made and loved by the little ones. However, there is a problem with this particular set. Even though it states that it is for one year olds a up, there are two very small pieces that I had to put away as they are choking hazards to babies under 3. These pieces either need to permanently be attached, enlarged, or the age range must be changed to over 3."
5,Brilliantly terrible!,"For years now I've been collecting covers of Beatles tunes. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised (e.g. Mel torme' doing 'She's Leaving Home'). Sometimes I feel like someone is sticking a dentist drill in my ear (e.g. The Springville, Utah 7th Grade Choir singing 'Help'). Most of the songs on this album fit into the later catagory. May West said; ""when I'm good, I'm good- when I'm bad, I'm better"". Well, when she sings the beatles...she's worse!This CD is campy, ecclectic and perfect for running people you don't like out of your parties!"
5,Comprehensive Guide for the Experienced,"If you have no idea where to start with painting and drawing I recommend ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"".This Artist's Handbook is a terrific resource for those with some experience who are looking to expand their range of skills.The section on using pastels was particularly helpful.A great value, quality art book!"
3,Not quite as good as The Frenchman's Love Child,"I have read just about all of Lynne Graham's books and was disapointed in this one. The heroine bugged me.If you're a big Graham fan, like me, you'll get this one anyways. I did like how the heroine was gifted in math and helped the hero's nephew with his math. I really liked her other recent book, The Frenchman's Love Child, much better. I would also suggest other Graham books like A Spanish Groom, Tempetuous Reunion or Fiery Baptism."
2,Pippa picked a pickled pepper,"While the story started pretty well for me, I had a real problem with the heroine. Perhaps I just don't understand how ppl with low self-esteem think.Andreo was definitely placed in great light for his patience and persistence with a difficult woman. He must really care for her.Since one of Pippa's good points is her intelligence; even more than Andreo's in math, I would have liked to see something at the end to know what became of her career if any."
5,CRUCIAL VOLUME IN THE SERIES!,"Even if you recognize no other song on this disc, it has the 12"" versions of Boogie Wonderland and Ain't No Stoppin Us Now, which makes it a MUST HAVE. Get it before it's out of print. Track times for this volume:1. heartbeat (9:47)2. ain't no stopping us now (10:45)3. ain't gonna hurt nobody (3:09)4. do you wanna get funky with me (9:09)5. boogie wonderland (8:22)6. you're the one for me (5:53)7. the beat goes on (6:43)8. shackles (5:25)9. we got the juice (5:14)10. hot stuff (5:56)11. bussle (5:13)"
5,For my grangaughter's birthday.,"For my granddaughter's birthday, Been buying them since her birth. This is the first time I purchased from Amazon.com, I'm very pleased with my purchase. Fast delivery!"
4,Great Product - Bad Vendor,I really like the product and it does make a great margarita but buyer beware. The web site for ordering is not very clear and you may end up getting only one jar and paying $30 for shipping when you can get three jars for the same $30 shipping cost (does not include the product cost). I complained to the vendor but they didn't seem to care. I ended up paying $52.50 for one jar (including shipping) when I could have paid $97.50 for three jars which would be an average of $32.50 per jar (including shipping).
2,"Disappointing, but not surprising","A hodgepodge collection of performances from Santana from throughout the years. Much of these videos I've seen before, and chances are if you're a fan of Santana, you've seen some of them too. The only difference is, the annoying commentary during songs. It's not that I don't enjoy listening to Carlos talk (he certainly has a way with words), but not in the middle of a song. I'd rather hear him play than talk. This occurs in just about every song.The splicing of about a dozen different performances of Black Magic Woman was definitely bizarre and confusing to the viewer. I wasn't expecting much from this DVD (despite a fantastic track list, I was expecting disappointment) so I'm not too upset. But the commentary during songs irritates me to no end (take a look at my Allman Brothers Live at Great Woods review). I'm still waiting for a really good DVD of Santana performing some of these great songs."
5,Book for father-in-law,He was pleased to get this book as a gift. He has an older model airstream and this was the perfect gift for him.
2,Not what I expected,"As much as I tried to like this book, it really didn't do it for me. The book was more a story about Wally Byam than Airstream. I was looking for something more about the evolutionary history of the land yacht and the more common experiences of their owners. Too bad - the book about Airstream is still to be written."
5,"Superb graphics, archival photos, and historical text!","This coffee table book is a great gift - striking images, an original topic, really interesting text, and it's reasonably priced. The book follows the inventor of the Airstream, an eccentric wanderer named Wally Byam, as he spreads his gospel (""Adventure is where you find it, any place, every place, except at home in the rocking chair."") and organizes Airstream caravans around America and around the planet. We see these Zelig-like aluminum torpedoes with every famous backdrop: the Egyptian pyramids, rice fields in Thailand, the leaning tower of Pisa, and Red Square in communist USSR. The photos are at once kitschy and nostalgic and hokey and beautiful, and the layout of the book allows each image to really resonate before leading you to another page or chapter in the life of Wally Byam's ""land yacht."" A terrific piece of Americana, and a great, reasonable find..."
3,"Not What I Expected, Either!","Though never having owned an Airstream, I've always been interested in its development and history as the 'Cadillac' of travel trailers. This book was, for the most part, a disappointment. I was primarily interested in the trailers themselves. There are very few illustrations of floor plans over the years, of the development of the interiors and exteriors--after all, today's trailers are quite different from 40 years ago! A great deal of space is dedicated to a few Wally Byam caravans with some large, page-filling photos.In the end, this can make a nice coffee-table book for Airstream fans. I'd still like to see a more comprehensive research into the trailers themselves and their development."
2,Verbose!,"This book contains an interesting and plentiful assortment of photos and illustrations, but it is a drag to read. It is verbose and frequently veers off course to matters only loosely connected to Airstream's history. And the storyline jumps around and virtually disappears, time after time, into thickets of fluff. Overall I found it took unusual effort to find the wheat amidst the chaff in this book, and to follow the often sketchy, weaving trail of the story. Were I not so interested in Airstreams, I would not have finished it. I recommend it only to those likewise enamored."
3,"Good, just not as expected","While this book offers much for those interested in the people behind Airstream, it offers little about the trailers themselves. Still, a good and interesting read."
5,"good music, good message","the 'science' isn't 100% up-to-date on these tunes, but they're so good that it doesn't matter. each song on this cd (and all the other schoolhouse rock cds) is stylistically unique, and they're all well-written and beautifully performed. these songs have been stuck in my head for decades now.btw, 'scripture rock guy', you and your oh-so-subtle plugs SUCK."
5,Heavy Duty Light that matches Price Pfister Catalina faucets.,"Well made light , came with a broken globe however customer service was great and they shipped me a replacement. Finish was clean, glass looked good. Very heavy fixture not cheap. Overall good looking at a great price. I have the brushed nickel finish, it looks great with my Price Pfister brushed nickel faucet."
1,Frost King V27GA X-treme Rubber Weatherstrip,"When I removed the protective plastic strip from the back of the weatherstripping and attempted to stick the weatherstripping to the surface of my door, the weatherstripping immediately fell off. It seems the residual advesive left on the plastic protective strip was stickier than what was on the rubber. Maybe this item was in storage too long prior to shipping, and the adhesive transferred from the rubber to the plastic strip. Whatever the reason, I had to return the item."
3,Lost souls,"'El invierno en Lisboa' is an interesting exercise into a group of characters, lost in their daily lives and connected by loose ties of friendship, love and hate. Written in 1988, when the author was 32, the book contains traces of the distinctive style that Muñoz Molina developed later on in the 90's."
4,Go Angels,"Great looking towel with deep and rich colors. However, The towel would have been a little nicer had it been thicker."
4,RIDE IT!,"The title song alone is worth the price of admission. The other songs are well done, though a few of the vocals are a little rough."
5,What a great book!,"What a great book! Most how-to books can be dull or hokey, but the advice in this book is interesting, creative, fun and often hilariously funny. The authors take an important topic and make it very accessible. I was pretty nervous about starting a book group before I encountered ""Good Books Lately,"" but now I'm encouraged and excited! After just starting this book, I felt like Ellen Moore and Kira Stevens were good friends of mine! This book's a great reference that I'll use and recommend often."
4,Good Books Lately,"Everything one could want to know about starting a book group in a helpful, informative, and entertaining format. A great read from authors who are not just PhDs in English but clearly women who love reading and writing. In addition to detailed descriptions of just about everything one would need to know to get started and keep going, the authors provide lists of books that have proved to be most popular with reading groups. Loved the part about their meeting with Oprah. This is the sort of book just to keep handy to refer back to when you need inspiration or validation in what you're doing whether it's preparing for a group meeting or analyzing a book on your own."
5,Explore the Castle,"It's sort of a shame that this is the first and only review for this book. Graves' ""White Goddess"" is an idiosyncratic but brilliant treatment of mythology, and ""Good-bye to All That"" may be the premier World War I memoir. So, what happens when you take a writer with such wide ranging interests and experience, and pop him into an ancient mysterious castle, with a stalwart hero and a treasure to be found? Well, you get what may be the most restrained, spare, interesting and resonant treasure hunt ever. Reading this is probably not going to transform anyone's life, but it will introduce a young reader to quality, assured, literate writing. And did I mention it involves exploring an abandoned castle?"
5,"WOLVERINE 10"" FIGURE","This Wolverine 10"" figure comes with 2 knives. It's easy to articulate better than the 5"" figure of this version that marvel came out with. You can actually move the arms. In the 5"" figure version of this, you can't, but thats because that one has a feature of a button on the back that allows the arms to swing up and down. This 10"" figure does not. I think this one is the best though because articulation of the arms is always a plus! :)"
3,meh,"I have had the filter for about 3 months.It filters the air very well.The only real problems are that the carbon for scent removal is before the hepa filter,ideally it should be after.So after a few weeks the air that omes out of the filter smells kind of like a vacuum that needs a new bag.But the price is good,and it puts out a lot of air."
2,brrrrrrrrr!!!,"Noisy but I could put up with that. However, the air coming out of the unit is as cold as if it was an air conditioner. I can't imagine how that would affect the heat in a room in the winter. Going back to the brand I bought last month. I don't recommend this one for anyone unless they like ice cold air blowing out of the unit all the time."
3,Simple and functional,I live in upstairs apartment and this product gives me relief from the smokers below. Low speed is very quiet on this four speed unit.
2,The power button keeps freezing,"I already had a desktop model from this company, so I was excited to get one into the living room. But the timer is a mystery and the power button gets stuck on so that you have to unplug the unit to turn it off. Rather disappointed."
5,"as described, maybe better","Imagine coming home to a clean-smelling room and knowing that you were doing your best to get pollutants out the air. That's what this purifier did for our master bedroom. My wife said the room smelt ""fresh"" when she first walked in after it had been running for a couple of hours. Can't ask for much more."
3,Good but is not working after 10 days,"We purchased this product for our 2 year old son. He has constant ear infections and runny nose and many people recommended an air purifier. Well the first 9 days this product worked great- he woke up every morning without a runny nose. We were thrilled until last night. We plugged it in and the smell of smoke filled his room. We contacted the company for warranty information, they were very friendly and will replace it. BUT they don't have inventory right now, asked us to call back in 3 weeks. Well that is JUST GREAT- how many trips to the doctor will we go to in between now and then. :("
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this filter because my previous trusty Kenmore Hepa filter was very old and I couldn't find filters in that size any longer. I gave this new Holmes filter a few night's worth of trying it out, but it seems that each time it was on, my allergy symptoms were worse. Not sure what was happening or why. Too bad. I bought it based on the great reviews it received but unfortunately, I did not have the same experience."
1,bad interior design,"dirty air must pass through 2 filters - first through a charcoal filter, then through a hepa filter. when first installing the filters you will notice the hepa filter has a nice rubber seal to separate the intake part from the exhaust part, or so you would think. after using this for a couple of months i looked down the exhaust vent and noticed lots of debris. upon inspection of the filters, i noticed the lager parts of dust that go through the charcoal filter will actually go through AND AROUND the hepa filter. the hepa filter needs a little more pressure (better seal) between intake and exhaust to work effectively. one could rig it, but why. although it gets most of the dust, i don't recommend this for people who need true hepa quality."
2,Broke after 8 months...,"The first filter replacement came around, new filters were put in and it never worked again. I've owned this unit for about 8 months. I used it nightly on the lowest setting for a little background noise and air filtration. I'm pretty disappointed in the longevity of this air filter. While it worked, it was great."
3,"just received and it's been used, not new","I just opened the boxes and on the bottom of the unit it has green markings so I know the unit was returned from someone else. I should have received a ""used or refurbished"" discount since it's not new. No instructions at all with the ""new"" unit. I had to figure out myself how and where to install the carbon filters. Will know later how it works and if it will be returned. Disappointed with Amazon purchase as they did no inspection of the product before it was shipped."
3,Performance,A low speed noise has developed. The noise is not present at speed settings of 2 or higher. It sounds like the impeller is rubbing against something intermittentley. I will investigate further to determine the source of the noise.
5,Great bowls!,"Love these bowls! Bought them for my new kitchen, and they are fantastic! They coordinate perfect with a set black and tan plates that have the black matte bottom like the bowls themselves. It's too difficult to match reds when you aren't buying in person. The inner color red is a deep brick, and not so much the ruby it looks in the pictures. Largest bowl can work for salads, and the smaller ones are great for smaller items. I've gotten numerous compliments on them, and am super happy."
2,Could sap the pep of a popular cheerleader,"All the goth kids in my neighborhood are so horrified that mundane ol' Rhino has so nailed their musical ethos that they are donning bright polyester seperates, growing out their natural hair color, and tossing their Tim Burton DVDs in the trash. Nice work Rhino!"
1,Rhino knows Goth...,"Repackaged Goth music courtesy of Rhino. Thank you for telling us what goth music is and what artists are goth. The masses no longer have to think, we only have these record companies to decide for us what category a certain genre of music belongs to.And what the hell is the no talent, severely lacking in originality act like AFI doing on this compilation? What A F_cking Insult!I suppose the next compilation would target the Industrial crowd. Oh! Oh! I can't wait for Linkin Park to be in that compilation!"
1,Fell apart after less than 6 months,"We received these as a gift at Christmas. We loved the feel of them but noticed that they were starting to get little thin spots and runs in the fitted sheet, then last night one of those spots actually tore when I was turning over in bed. We haven't been rough on them and have followed the washing instructions...and yet here we are with a whole set of sheets that is useless because the fitted sheet is torn, and they don't appear to sell individual sheets. I've had much cheaper sheets that lasted a lot longer. Not impressed."
1,Believe the reviews - DON'T BUY THESE SHEETS,"After 1 wash & 1 use, I returned these sheets. I always follow the washing instructions but that didn't matter. These sheets were on our bed for less than a week when I noticed the threads pulling apart in several spots. I bought these as a replacement for other high thread count sheets I've had for YEARS. Those sheets still do not show the wear that these do after only 1 use. The quality of these sheets pale in comparison to REAL 500 thread count sheets. I purchased 300 TC from Amazon that were much better quality. Save your money and your time. Buy your sheets elsewhere."
1,Wrinkle Free? No!,"These sheets may have fewer and further-apart wrinkles than others, but they are not wrinkle free. However, the fabric is soft and lovely to the touch."
3,The Gold is Beige,"The fabric in these sheets seem nice and washed well. However, the color is more beige than gold. I had wanted a deeper gold color, but decided to keep the sheets anyway since they were a good buy. How wrinkle-free they are remains to be seen. I've found that can only be determined after multiple washing."
5,FALL APART AFTER 6 MONTHS,"These sheets were wonderful. They were so soft and the right size, finally, for a king-sized bed, especially if you have a topper on the mattress. The sheets washed beautifully too! However, it is now 6 months later, the fitted sheet ripped and now the set can no longer be used. Save your money and pick something else."
4,Terrific sheets,"Love these sheets. They truly are wrinkle free. They feel great, wash great! I can't wait to get another set!"
2,Awesome sheets that don't last long,"These were probably the most comfortable sheets I have ever had on my bed (even better than the 800 thread count set we previously had). They were extremely soft and light plus they didn't wrinkle after being washed. UNFORTUNATELY they only lasted a couple ""cycles"" on the bed before holes were worn through them at the foot end. If you are an active sleeper like I am your feet will wear a hole in them after they have been on the bed a couple times. If they were cheaper I would still by them because they are that comfortable. If you are an inactive sleeper with well manicured feet I would recommend these. Otherwise don't waist your money."
2,DIFFERING OPINION,"I agree with other reviews in that the product looks good, and is easy to use. I disagree, however, with comments regarding accuracy. I could get a different reading by 2 - 3 pounds within a couple of minutes. Hmmm."
1,"Very bad, broke quickly",I expected some quality for the high price. Its legs broke very quickly and now is unusable and I have to throw in the trash. Do not recommend buying this item.
2,"Criminal Poisoning: Investigational Guide for Law Enforcement, Toxicologists, Forensic Scientists, and Attorneys","I was disappointed with this book when I recieved it. The book has been written on a basic superficial level and was not what I expected. If the intended target audience are those with little or no science background, then this might make interesting reading. There is far too little chemistry and toxicology in the book for anyone who wishes to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of the field.Criminal Poisoning: Investigational Guide for Law Enforcement, Toxicologists, Forensic Scientists, and Attorneys (Forensic Science and Medicine)"
4,Great adventure story,"If you like books like ""My Side of the Mountain,"" this book will appeal to you. It has the same elements of a teenager finding his way to adulthood. With the gorgeous backdrop of Alaska, there are confrontations with bears, a corrupt salmon packing plant and a test of survival skills in the wilderness. I have read this book a few times and, given the opportunity, I'd do it again."
2,Enjoyable but not durable,"I bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She's 18 months old now. She loves looking at the pictures and saying the names of people. However, she was able to start ripping the plastic sleeves apart and taking out pictures after having it for 1 month. At this point, the photo album is completely destroyed."
3,A BIT THIN ...,"The towel is just ok. The color and logo detail are fine, however, the towel itself is very thin, not absorbant and fluffy. A much better quality pool towel can be purchased at Walmart or Target for $5.00 (I know, as I did)."
2,Fair quality,"The logo on this towel is great, but the quality is fair to poor. One run thru the dryer and I imagine I'll be using it for rags."
2,"Product probably good, seller stinks","Product probably good, seller stinks. Be careful buying item from this seller, very difficult to contact, very slow in shipping. Caveat Emptor!!"

5,Great Video Card !!!! Five stars :-),this video card was very easy to install and easy to use. Im so happy with my dual monitor set up (so worth every penny i spend).
3,GOOD PRODUCT,"Didn't hear any complaints from the person that requested this item, will probably be purchasing more when it is requested"
5,"The apple fell everywhere, could they pick them up?","Apple tree wa base on love betrayal and loss of innocence, camille is the mother of camille jalisha and corine, there mother is running a cat house where she is having her men come and there is will give them sex for money. Jalisha is the oldest of the two there mother tell them when she have companie do not come out of there room but they come out and be looking in the key hole and watch they mother have sex with these man.Camille gets mad at jalisha and as her can she do better then her and camille put's here out there at sixteen having sex when I finish the book something I read move me: The apple fell from the tree rolled down the hill and has planted firmly in the ground this is so true."
5,Interesting and inspiring life story,"In Dreams by Elizabeth Grandbois is the first-person account of how this remarkable woman is fighting Lou Gehrig's Disease.Grandbois shows impressive spirit and demonstrates the merit in pressing on in the face of great adversity. Parts of her book brought tears to my eyes and it was inspiring throughout.In Dreams also features some outstanding poetry by Grandbois, a Foreword written by Murray McLauchlan and an Afterword written by Michael B. Davie. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, cover to cover."
5,Living With The Wolfman ~ Season 1 DVD,"This dvd is a must have for wolf lovers! Shaun is a brilliant researcher and though his methods may seem a bit unorthidox by some, he truly gets to the heart of the wolf. Never before has someone been able to get an inside look at wolves, and pack dynamics... directly from the wolf's point of view.In this dvd, Shaun's fiance, Helen, is introduced to the pack in hopes of becoming a wolf nanny. Helen brings humor and a bit of innocence that was very endearing. It was wonderful getting to see the wolves through their eyes.Definitely worth it! The only thing I didn't like, was the fact that it got canceled after the first season!My recommendation... check out his other DVD documentary from the Discovery Channel, ""A Man Among Wolves"". You'll never look at wolves the same way again!"
3,Not Drawn By Warren,"Although Amazon lists this album as created by Adam Warren, only the text is by Warren, while the pictures are drawn by a host of rather mediocre artists. Most of the time, I found myself thinking how hilarious this could have been if drawn by Warren himself, but now most gags fall to the ground with a thud.With many different artists, the graphical style is changing too much, and none of them manage to produce anything above the mediocre. The stories are as good as you would expect them from Warren's hand, but the whole album just demonstrates how important it is to have a talented artist rendering the author's vision.This book is a lot of wated potential."
3,Meanwhile,"This TPB is issues 66-70, and has issues 43 & 44 added. The first part, isses 66-70 art work is done well, the story line is well written, well the last part of the book, isses 43 & 44 was well writen and entertaining, the art work had much to be desired.The first part, Caitlin has to help Ivana to idetify a new Gen Active. Interesting play into the story from the radio, kind of cute.The second story can be a bit confusing, it was about Roxy and Grunge, and had lots of flashbacks.The thrid story is about, Sara and and has to do with her past and her Uncle, a nice story.The fourth is about a pop song that grows to dominate all media outlets, and is driving Caitlin crazy.I gave it 3 stars as the stories were good, i think they were just average."
5,O2 sensor,Perfect- My 240 now gets 22mpg instead of 13mpg. My mechanic was right. It is a perfect fit with the right connectors

5,great product,"the vent visors worked wonderfully. Easy to install , and love the quality... would recommend to alli will buy this product again if necessary"
5,Moving true story of someone who overcame great challenges,"This is an interesting story of a man who overcame great challenges in his life, including self-pity and poverty. It was easy reading and worth the time."
4,An amazing true story!,"As co-producer and creator of the Fox Television series: ""BEYOND BELIEF: Fact or Fiction,"" I have come across some very interesting, true stories. When I found the true story of Michael Dowling, I knew I needed to learn more about this incredible human being. I searched the archives in the Minnesota State Historical Society. I talked with his survivors. I wrote the book BLIZZARD based on his life. I am currently working on the ""ICE CANDLE"" the screenplay based on the book. Most people say they have a different outlook on life and the challenges that come their way- after reading BLIZZARD. It's the story of a survivor, who at age 14 survived a fierce blizzard, only to lose both legs, an arm and most of the fingers on his remaining hand. Yet, Michael Dowling went on to achieve things in his life most of us only dream of. I hope you enjoy it. Let me know. -the author... LR Lehmann llehmann@burgoyne.com"
3,What's the point?,"Musicians playing on tribute albums dedicated to unique stylists like SRV have two options: Play it exactly like the original, or give it a complete makeover in their own style. The first option leads to pale imitations of the original- check out the otherwise excellent Rick Derringer on ""Pride and Joy""- and the second option is often so far from the original that the whole ""tribute"" acpect gets lost in the mix.Everyone on this disk pretty much went for the first option- do it like Stevie- and that's a pity. The disk is full of good performances that can stand on their own, but in explicitly making it an SRV gtribute, the listener really has no choice but to compare each cut to his or her memory of the original, and given that choice, it's better to stick with the original."
4,Best non-Stevie playing SRV tracks,"All the guys playing on this SRV tribute do a good job. Their playing is technically good and highlight the SRV legacy. However, if you are looking for the best, go back to the SRV originals. The playing is mostly true to the SRV sound but somehow lacks the excitement that SRV generated. Almost worth having, but a best of SRV is a better buy, or generate your own with MP3."

1,Hi from a French Ally McBeal fan !,"Hi all ! I'm sorry to confirm that the entire Ally McBeal five seasons are available here in Europe at as a low price as 40 euros for each season. Each season includes six dvds in one single smart box with a booklet included !You have choice to listen to English or French language, subtitled in English for the hearing impaired, French or Nederlands.Don't believe me ? Have a look at amazon.fr. But you need a multizone capable home dvd reader, cause those dvds are region 2 zoned.On my side, cannot understand what drove the 20th century Fox to deprive you all of the whole collection ?"
1,USA GYPED!!,This is by far one of the most creative shows ever on tv and we still don't even have a complete 1st series! Come on fox! you blew it! don't buy this cheap product go to ebay where you can now get the complete series from china with english in a non region dvd
2,incomplete and unacceptable for that reason,"If you don't have a multisystem TV and DVD player to utilize PAL, you can use a computer, PC with a DVD program or Mac to watch DVDs that you get from Amazon UK. I don't know why, but the entire 5 seasons are available in the United Kingdom, and I thought that Ally McBeal was one of the most delightful televisions programs to come along in years, and was sad when it was canceled. The abreviated box set available in the U.S. using the NTSC format is just that --- abreviated, and cannot do justice to a great series. As an American, I think we deserve better. Having traveled with the USN extensively, I have a multisystem television and DVD player. But you can also use a MAC or PC to watch."
4,Ally McBeal episodes,"12/30/2004Here is what Fox has to say about releasing additional Ally McBeal episodes. You may send them e-mail to: FoxDrop@4icc.com if you are so inclined ...""Fox has no plans to release more episodes at this time. I will forward your request onto our corporate office so they can see what the public would like to see on DVD.Thank you,Fox Consumer Services""FoxDrop@4icc.com"
1,I know why they won't release Ally in the US.,"Many television series will never come out in DVD box sets becaue they contain too much music. It is financially unreasonable for the production studios to purchase the rights to every song in the series. The copyright laws are not enforceable in other countries and thus the UK is lucky! So, a show like Ally, essentially a musical, will never be released in the US! But in the days of TiVo that would be ok, if a network would pick it up in syndication. Why did FX drop it? WHY?????(The same goes for shows like ""The Wonder Years"" and ""Moonlighting."")"
1,Where's the rest of the seasons???,"I was planning on buying this cd as a gift for an Ally Mcbeal fan but after reading the reviews I changed my mind! This show was great, I cannot believe the entire collection is not out on DVD, I'm going on amazon.co.uk to see what I find?"
2,"great show, bum deal",There's no reason to offer the consumer short weight; these cds are inexcusably short in the # of episodes.
1,n Ally McBeal Fan,"It's a shame that this series has not been offered for region 1(United States). But being a great Ally McBeal fan and because it was one of the best comedies in recent memory, I went and bout the complete 5 Season series (European Region 2) and then bought a DVD player that could play them. There's always a way to overcome stupidity !"
5,Absolutely great!,If only all the episodes were available on video! These (and other) episodes are always so wonderful to watch over and over... no longer do I have to watch the fuzzy tapes that I recorded myself. Such great high-quality.. and best yet.. NO COMMERCIALS TO SKIP!
2,Disappointed,The season one box set should have had a lot more episodes than it did. I was very disappointed with the limited number of episodes in the set. And the music video and other guide was a waste of veiwing.
5,"More, please!","Ally McBeal is a great funny and touching show, with a splendid cast and unbelievable level of writing. This set is, basically, a sampler for the first season. The episodes are very good, and you can watch them time after time and still enjoy them.The main drawback of this set is the fact that none of the other episodes are availble. WHY????????? They ARE in GB, so why not on the states? And while you are at it, bring us ""The Practice"", too!It would also be nice to have some extras like commentary or interviews included in the DVD set, but at least give us the shows themselves!!!Oh, 20 Century Fox, why are you so cruel?"
1,"Where is Season 1, 2, 3, 4, 5","Why hasn't this show been re-issued on DVD for each season??? There are DVD's for every show that has ever aired, even ones that have only had 5 episodes. Ally was on the air for 5 years. Why have the complete seasons only been reissued in Europe and Japan?? Please bring us the US complete version of Ally McBeal!!"
2,where are the others!,"How can they possibly expect an ""ally"" fan to be happy with a boxed set that contains less than half of the episodes of the season? And when will the other season come out? if they ever will?!"
1,Amazon~Contact FOX!!!,Amazon could you please do whatever you can to contact FOX and or begin a VOTING poll to attempt to get Ally McBeal on DVD by seasons!~It is pretty sad that an american made show is completely available in Europe in all 5 total seasons!~What kind of marketing message is this communicating? WHY is it not avaiable to us here in the US? What is going on? I would rate this a negative star rating if I could and agree it is a waste of time and money to purchase for anyone wanting to really enjoy this wonderful series!!!!!~Runa
4,Where Oh Where Is Ally McBeal??,"Ok so a token effort here from the studios to get us to part with our hard earned cash........hey guys, we've done that! So now where are the rest of the episodes from Series I and while your at it, you shouldn't start something if you don't intend to finish it, so where are Seasons II, etc...A great show that has won the hearts of millions of viewers around the World, so why not reward those loyal viewers with what they want....Ally on DVD forever!Region 1 usually leads the way but here you guys are left slacking as Europe now has Season II available via 2 Box Sets (yet even Europe doesn't have the rest of Season I!!).So please Mr Studio Finance Manager and Mr Studio Marketing Manager take a good look at what potential earnings you are missing out on here....you know it makes sense!!"
2,Why aren't they all available????????,David Kelly why haven't all of your Ally McBeal seasons been put into boxed set? They would be VERY popular!
1,Not worth it!,"I LOVE this show, but the DVD box set is definitely not worth it.They should just release all series instead!"
1,Hurry up Please,"How is it they can get Dawson's Crack - opps sorry Dawson's Creak (about a group of sad over intellectualized, teenagers, who use words which most of us normal people don't even know the meaning to.) on to DVD but they can't get great shows like Alley Mcbeal on to them? Come on, what is the world coming to."
1,UPSET!,"I love the show Ally Mcbeal, and I am upset that there is only one season released here in the US! I ordered three seasons from the UK website only to get them in the mail and find out that they are not compatible with the systems of the U.S. so either way I am still with out any of the episodes!It cost me $32.00 to send it back to the U.K., and I'm not even sure amazon.uk will refund the cost of the sets! So I am out of over $100.00 trying to buy the series of this wonderful show. I am upset at the entire situation!"
5,I purchased this as a gift for someone,I purchased this as a gift for someone. She absolutely loved it! She is a huge Ally McBeal fan and could not wait to watch it. The price is right. I really would have liked to purchased the other ones but they were not available.
4,Loved it but confused...,"I had really had low expectations when I ordered this, (but it was so affordable) since the series final year was pretty weak, but when I again, saw the first season's fresh approach, I was thoroughly delighted, UNTIL...<enter drum roll here> I realized that this was not a FULL season one -- there were only a few episodes.I am eagerly await a complete season one of Ally McBeal -- I hope it's in the works. Until then, this teaser is a hoot and if you're in doubt, this will certainly help you remember why you first started watching the show!"
3,UK Please!!!!,"Hi to whomever it was that suggested buying Ally Mcbeal from the uk website. I was wondering, how do I get it sent over here?? They won't allow the shipment because my residence is located in the states. Got any advice?"
1,Anerexic White Chick Lawyer,"The title describes the entire premise of this show but I will explain further. She is a saucy, skinny, white girl, who just graduated from college and is in a law firm were it seems that people don't actually work because of this horrible premise the shows creators had to fill in the blanks with sexual references and all out idiotic jokes (look at the dancing baby). This show sucked and that is why it is off the air."
1,Waste of money,"Don't buy it. Rarely works, and when it does, your afraid of it breaking/falling apart in the air.Not worth the money. But the idea of it was great;)"
1,waste of money,"Dont by this plane if you intend to fly it. It only has rudder and throttle controls, so controlled flight is limited. Please note, on the reviews of this product....the only positive reviews are from the manufacturer. The reviews from real people all accurately describe how crappy this plane actually is."
1,Defective - seems to be a trend...,"This product has a lot of potential fun and educational value but I and some other reviewer clearly got lemons. I'm very fastidious about following directions but this my never flew more than a 25 feet horizontally and never rose more than eight feet without veering off to the right and slamming into the ground. The rudder's range of motion was limited to left of center when it should have been able to move equally in both directions. I believe that the engine was mounted askew and there were no fine tuning screw mounts to address this issue. Regarding durability, the propellers break easily. The fuselage of the plane is very durable but the wings and rudder are very flimsy. Quite a dissapointing purchase."
3,Not very Easy to Fly,"It`s very important that the first battery charge is fully un-charged without flying the airplane. After that charge, the battery maintains a ok charge time for its capacity.The few times I tried to fly it, I end crashing in the first turns.To say that I have flowned nitro gas trainers before without crashing.Maybe it`s because the plane turns when at a low altitude, it has a tendency to turn before it reaches a decent altitude. If you can control that, then it will fly ok.For the price it costs, it has a very acceptable level of performance.The lights look very nice at night."
3,decent for smaller dogs,"This worked great until recently the latch looks to have been damaged, it can be easily open. My 40lbs lab is on this for a few hours a day, sometimes trying to run further than she can, i'm thinking thats why"
3,"Works great, but rusts fast","For an outdoor tie out I thought I should be fine with leaving the tie out outdoors, right? Well, the metal rusted within a week of use. Still works fine but lost its luster. Overall, I'm happy with the product, it's serving its purpose well, just wish it didn't rust so fast."
3,works ok but have reservations,"it definately restrains my dog but he has broke loose twice, i have to put duct tape on the lever action to keep it from inadvertently sliding from his movements"
2,tie out cable,"it works fine but i wish it had different type of snaps on it, i live in sandy area and they pack with sand and i cannot get them open. also the plastic coating on the cable cracks easily. now it is like many short pieces of coating that are rough on your hands when you run cable through to get to snap. knots failry easily and i have no idea how the dog did that!"
4,Good enough,The product was adequately described on the website and the shipping was fine. The only issue we had is that we normally purchase our tie out's from stores where we can try it out. We've bought them at various places and all seem to have the same quality. This one is the exception. The clasp is a little cheap and smaller. For a couple dollars more I could buy a better product. We won't purchase this item again since we'd rather have something that will last a little longer.
4,Good Live Music Indicates Devotion To Their Forte,"I like Earth, Wind & Fire (especially live). The only setbacks of ""Greatest Hits Live"" (and I know that the the live ones aren't always gonna duplicate the recorded) were: 1.Maurice White could have included more ad-libs (as in ""Can't Hide Love""). 2.Some of the songs were, of course- short, but some just too short for my taste. 3.The horn riffs on the breakdown of ""After The Love..."" were omitted. 4.Someone else sang lead on ""Shining Star."" But besides that, everything was tight. Anybody who grew up in the 60's/70's, or anybody who likes good retro R&B should own this. If you don't own this... get it (if you can find it). Fortunately, you can order here at Amazon."
1,A waste of money,This would have been a lot of fun had it not fell apart the second day my 4 year old daughter slid on it. We were very disgusted with the whole thing.
1,Don't waste your money.....,"The whole product description is a sham. The slide itself does not inflate like it states or shows in the picture. Spiderman does not shoot water from his hand, it barely drips. And the ""pool"" doesn't hold water - it comes out of the side and makes a muddy mess. Whatever length you get, it's at least 5 feet shorter than what it states on the package.My niece (10 y.o.) and nephew (6 y.o.) wouldn't go near the thing, not even after grandpa and their two Aunties tossed themselves down the slide to show how ""fun"" it was. The slip & slides from the 80's were more fun.This was a complete waste of money - and a huge disappointment for my nephew who is into Spiderman!!"
4,review,I bought this slide for my sons 3rd B-Day Party. It is suprisingly well built & reasonably priced. The one draw back is that it needs 2 seperate water FEEDS to operate properly which is not brought to your attention during assembly.It was definately a hit with all the kids.
1,Tokina 3x 52mm has bad reviews,"My father in law gave me this as it did not work on his camera (bad image quality). I tried this on my Nikon D40 attaching it to the 55-200mm VR kit lens, and the image quality is bad (autofocus doesnt work too well either with this on). A couple of reviews and comments on the web also gave this lens negative comments."
4,a singer who could sing,"i bought this cause i didnt know her name. i listen to singers. i listen alot...near 25,000 LPs...1000's of CDs...so if i dont know the name i give a listen. NOT BAD...not beverly kenney or billie or krall or carmen, but a very good COOL sounding singer in the Bethlehem Girls vain. a NICE little kinda up-tempo disc with a singer who could sing."
5,Great Story,"Great way to tell the Christmas story - from Mary's perspective. Gift was for my young niece and nephew, but ""screened"" it with my teenagers, and they enjoyed it, too."
1,I was appalled!,I loved the idea of this story and love the illustrator's work so was excited to purchase this book. I was so disappointed. Most of the story seemed silly but I could have gotten beyond that part. It was the final chapter that appalled me. How can you talk about killing babies and children when you are writing a children's book? the author actually used the word kill several times. I realize that scripturally it is correct but it was unnecessary. If the author felt that part was important then it should have been worded differently.I would not recommend this book and I sent it back to Amazon. There is no way I would read that to any child.
2,"Lovely illustrations, but portrays Mary wrong.","Pretty good overall; lovely illustrations, but Mary is portrayed as a little clueless. I doubt she screamed in pain as Jesus was about to be born, and why has the author portrayed her so ignorant? In the story she has no idea why the wise men arrive to pay homage to her child. Didn't the angel tell her he was to be the SON OF GOD, the King of Kings? Did she forget? In an effort to show the human side of Jesus, the author has gone too far; perhaps adding a bit too much detail (pus oozing from Jesus' wounded head, pain of childbirth) for the age 4-8 crowd. Incidentally, most beleive that Jesus was born in silence, without pain, preserving the virginity of His mother. A few small changes would have made this book wonderful; I didn't read it to my kids."
4,"Great tracks, not-so-great whole","Despite my delight with certain specific tracks (Charlie Sexton's rendition of ""Tennessee Plates"", and Vangelis' ""Song of the Sea""), the disk as a whole seems somehow less than the sum of its parts. Perhaps the choice of tracks to include contributes to this; I felt that Richie Havens' ""Inside of You"" was a little too sedate for the film and disk, and redundant in light of Wade Hubbard's ""You Can Fly"". Still, there are some very impressive tracks on this disk, and I'd have to give it a definite thumb's up."
3,"10 to 11, don't question, just get in.","Great stuff from the Fab Five of Indie Rock/Free Roll. You know what to expect here. It's Pavement, or as Kannberg calls them in the liner notes, ""teh Pave!!1!"" The sound quality takes a hit here and there, and there are some especially noticeable voices in the crowds. And I'm not just talking about track 9, when a fan loudly requests ""Shoot the Singer"" and all hell breaks loose. (I'm pretty sure Bob was using the Mini-Moog as a weapon at some point. That would explain why track 10's Grounded has a bit of crackle to it.) I'm giving it three stars as there are no real surprises here, and I can't honestly reccommend this over the upcoming Enhanced CD, with video footage of ""Westy,"" a 30-foot high, fire-breathing skeleton with horn-rimmed glasses."
5,thought provoking,I like how peter goodgame backs up and proves all points with scripture. The outline and timing of the rapture is convincing. I was surprised to learn that he does not have a long line of degrees behind his name. c rhyne
5,Dynamite aproach to understanding prophecy,"This is an excellent book. Peter nails pieces of the prophetic puzzle in place in a very well thought out, objective, and thorough approach to identifying and explaining the interconnections between the prophecies of Daniel, Ezekiel, the Olivet Discourse, and the Book of Revelation. This is a very refreshing viewpoint that goes a long way to placing these various prophetic scriptures in a very real perspective, each to the other, and to the events unfolding in the Middle East. The Day of the Lord does not come in with a wimper, it comes in with a BANG!"
4,Another excellent hard bop recording,"The whole record has an excellent drive.

2,A self-exploration piece gone awry.,"What I say above is most definatly the easiest way to define this novel. Though verbose, with beautiful use of words, it lacks one thing; a solid plot. It seems to me that it is just a medley of events, a ""day-in-the-life"" foray which continues on aimlessly to the end."
5,An engaging CD,"This is truly an engaging CD that makes me want to dance, to think, to laugh, and to cry. It is not often that I have been so moved by music. This seems a perfect marriage of Phillip Carout's compositions and Christian Matjias' artistry as a pianist. The selections on the CD elicit many and varied emotions all at once. One of my favorite selections is ""A Scottish Dream"" which is perfectly melancholic without being melodramatic. Another favorite is ""Pillow of Dreams I."" The unbridled energy of this track makes me want to dance and to take flight like a bird. One could disappear into this CD in a reverie and find it difficult to return."
2,don't bother,"I have read a lot of Janelle Taylor's books and this one was a waste of my time. The story was hard to get into and the characters's were hard to connect to, I literally could not finish it and that is not normal for me. I think if it was free I would have still gotten it but I wouldn't waste money on it. It was horrible."
1,Not Impressed,"I got this light from a store and it [is bad]! it has 2 lights so it chomps up batteries and unless u have it straight up it will not light up the whole screen and even when u do that u can get glare from the 2 lights and both sides of the screen. And if u want it on the angle so there is no glare there is a 2cm thick patch of darkness in the middle of the screen. Thats whats wrong with the lights itself, if u look at the back of it it has this big bulky box where the batteries go. If u want a good light get the wormlight it is good it needs no batteries and it is small and portable and it also has minimal glare.So if u want a good light dont get this go for the wormlight by nyko."
2,Not an option!,"I bought this light and its for sure that it doesnt work since the bulbs are always bottering and are a big distractions, besides the batteries run as hell.And altough u have new batteries the centered part of the screen is not really covered. So u can see ""fine"" in both of the sides but not in the middle.So dont buy it!"
3,Very Useful..If your GameBoy Survives,"The Traplight is extremely bright as far as handheld lighting systems go. I remember the old Lights for the Original GameBoy. They were weak with magnifying lenses on them...and were horrible in every sense of the word. The Traplight is extremely powerful, it does well and the glare left by both sides covers more of the black area that isn't part of the gameplay screen. My Complaint? Horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE Design in shape. It's a REAL pain to get it ONTO the system, and it will wear and tear the battery compartment over time. It eats batteries like a Christmas Turkey, and is just plain difficult to put on/remove. If it had some kind of 'unfolding' feature where it could be snapped in place easier, it'd be a sure winner with no problems whatsoever."
5,Best of three lights bought!,"Just opened the gameboys (early Christmas) and each one tried a different light. Wormlight doens't cut it, Pelican trap light favored by one, but the trap light was really nice. The light on the side interferes less than the others and lights it up really well when played in bed in the dark! It also protects. I am going to buy another! Enjoy!"
4,A 13-Year-old Game,This is a good light. I gave it a 4 because my traplight runs out of battery's to quickly but my friends dont(returning it for another one). The only bad thing is the center of the sreen has a little black spot but best light ever
5,original stuff,"arrived on time, in its original package, in really good condition, i think it was never open, works fine"
1,Pirated book,"Please don't buy this book. Editorial Pax produced this Spanish version without authorization from the publisher, Free Spirit Publishing."
4,de Tocqueville's Democracy in America,A classic and must read for anyone wanting to gain insight to our nation's history.
2,Not like the others,"I am an avid Animaniacs fan and was very disapointed with this cd. I was really being nice by giving it two stars. To those who are interested in this cd because of the Animaniacs Christmas Carol episode, don't be fooled. This is nothing like the show, which was a major let down. There is hardly a trace of the famous Animaniacs zany-ness we all love. If you want a hip hop version of the famous story, this may be for you. But to all those who had higher hopes, buy the Helloo Holidays movie and enjoy the season in a truer Animaniacs fashion."
3,"Different edition, Less typos.","I seem to have acquired a better edition that the other reviewers here. Anyways, this collection of short stories and almost serialized stories was a good read.Definately for the action/conflict oriented sci-fi reader."
3,"I've seen all of this before, except for 1 short story","This book is just a rehash of vintage Drake. Except for one short story, it's all previously published material. Not to say that if you haven't read any of this before, you will be disappointed. Not at all. It's just a shame that the publishers are trying to market this as a ""New"" book by Drake"
2,This should be a series of short stories. Not a novel.,"I'm sorry, but it seems like the author would get bored with one plot, and completely leave it behind unresolved. No thanks. I finished it, but not without having to force myself to keep going."
4,Why's Everyone Buggin'?,"Hey, maybe it's just me, cause everyone else who read this book said it was a failure. But i'm a huge David Drake fan, and this book, after Caught in the Crossfire was another great novel in the Hammer's Slammers series. I wasn't annoyed by the admittedly bad editing, and I felt that the sotry had many wonderful aspects, along with the amazing tank technology. Maybe it's just me, but I'd reccomend this book to friends."
3,"Only one new short story. Many, many typos.","The Tank Lords brings many of the Hammer's Slammers stories into one book, but only one new story. The many, many typographical errors make me wonder where else the publisher cut corners"
2,"Good stories, bad editing.","I enjoyed reading the stories. There were two reprinted that I had not seen before, and the new one was extremely interesting. The major flaw, however, was the poor editing. Someone had obviously gone through the text with a spell checker, but had not taken the time to read the stories to see if the correctly spelled words made any grammatical or contextual sense. While that may be (barely) acceptable for one or two instances, it is not acceptable time after time after time. Whoever the editor and proofreader were for this book should either be fired or at least have their pay docked for each error. If I were David Drake I would be upset to see my writing trashed by the publisher in this way. The book would have received a 9 or 10, were it not for the painful reading caused by the errors."
3,"Mostly ""Rolling hot""","This is mostly a reprint of ""Rolling hot"", available separately from Baen, prefaced by one story and followed by three stories and an Appendix and Afterword. I guess this is an okay book, for those who like the style. I guess I like Pournelle better; less senseless carnage, more optimism."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"The only thing going for this book is the tank technology. As for plot, character development, purpose, themes, etc., it had none. Also, the typographical errors were distracting."
1,What a waste of time,"The author of this book seems to have made pretty sure that the word ""cyan"" appears at least three times on every page. If that is all that you require from your reading material, this book will satisfy you. Otherwise, it stinks. No plot, no characters, no conflict, no interest."
4,Insane- Great instruction,"After watching Boost 1&2, I definately felt I was ready for more, and this is it. Wouldn't recommend it for 1st timers(BOOST is better for beginners) but if you've got the basics down and you want to push your limits, BOOSTING will be the tool.Sure this would be an amazing DVD for anybody wantng to turn pro too as it has everything in one package."
2,Music for Musicians,"Too many notes will kill you. Maybe my expectations were a little too high, but this is another 'hey, look at us, we can play our instrument'-CD. Just bunches of notes, a guitarsolo, a keyboard solo and then move up to the next song. A slow one this time, 'cause almost every prog-band has to do a ballad. Just through the amazing craftmanship and skills of these three giants i can hear clearly that they are not very good in songwriting. That's something else."
1,Moon Babies?,"... This album is probably the worst album made in the last five years. I bought it with such high expectations and I'll admit I was a little turned off by the name, but I thought that there might be some explanation for this terrible title, but there isn't. This album stinks and I hope that whoever is considering buying should go listen to Bob Dylan instead. [Sorry] if you disagree."
1,"I bought 4 of these, so not sure which one this is.","If this is the Decca CD. Look else where. After trying 3 of them, having the same problem with Act 2. I finally just bought a VHS tape, which works and sounds great."
3,B,We received the movie on time but the shape of it wasn't the best. We had to return the movie because it didn't work proper. The seller was very understanding and took care of the situation in a timely manner. I don't blame the seller for the dvd issues I just know how bad my husband wanted that movie so it was a little disappointing.
2,Something was not quite right,"I normally like chick lit, but this book was disappointing. The situations rang false (even though they were based on the author's actual experiences), and the characters just didn't seem real. The constant mention of Majuro got annoying.I stayed with it only to see what happened, and the ending was satisfying. But this was not one of those books where I was sad to leave the characters when I closed the cover."
2,Group of friends rescue a someone and find a beautiful woman on an island who is not what she seems.Could have been worse I say,"What would you do if rescuing people turned out to be a mistake. After thier boat bottoms out trying to save a drowning victim a group of friends discover a beautiful woman on a deserted island. After inviting her to join them the group starts to experience strange visions, along with having problems trying to leave. It may be skewed because the movies I watched before this were pretty boring, but this one actually wasn't too bad. It has some overused characters, the cocky boyfriend, the pretty girlfriend, the best friend in love with the girlfriend, and the strange hot girl who everyone falls in love with instantly. If I was up on my mythology I probebly would have noticed some things that may have made this more interesting, but overall there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. I give it a C+.Would I watch again? - Probebly not, but you never know."
2,A good start,"This started off good, but towards the end got kind of B-movie-ish. Watch it with your girl/guy and create you're own ""ending"" about half way through, you won't miss anything."
2,Just not interesting,"First of all, don't be fooled by the cover art. Other than one quick, largely anti-climactic scene, there's no correlation with the cover and the movie contents. Second, while the concept was generally interesting, it completely lacked punch throughout. The movie was definitely professionally done and has high production values, but the film just meanders scene to scene without bringing it all together, resulting in one blah bit after another. Additionally, the film tries to create a sense of constant confusion due to the siren affecting the characters thoughts. While this idea had great promise, it also fell flat. Rather than creating dramatic confusion and unease, it created simple actual confusion that unnecessarily and completely devolved the film into a incomprehensible narrative. To some degree, its almost worth a rental, especially if you've gone through the usual fare, just don't expect a great story."
1,IGNORE THIS SIREN,"SIREN is one of those movies you can't believe you watched, let alone bought! Don't fall for the deceptional cover cause it has nothing to do with the movie.The mythical story of sirens who lured sailors to their death with their seductive singing could've made an interesting premise. However, the script for SIREN bounces all over the place, inserting senseless allusions to what is real and what isn't. Throw in the inevitably boring lesbian scenes to add to the confusion. The siren herself is about as menacing as a slug and while lovely is hardly worth dying for. So much of the movie doesn't make sense, and it's really boring. The ending is both predictable and unimpressive.An ambulance ride with sirens blazing is more terrifying!"
2,Better as a porno,"The acting was atrocious, but the sex scenes were awesome. The director should have just turned it into a porno, then it could have been the best porno ever as the plot was more than enough for a porn movie but not quite enough for a theatrical release. It's never a good thing when you don't care if all the characters die."
5,"It's Great, thats why it won the Grammy!","I'm a Beausoleil addict! I agree with everything Riverdude said about how wonderful this CD is and I bought this one from David Doucet himself from the back of his car so that makes it even more special to me. Newcomers and diehard fans of Beausoleil must own this one! Oh and Riverdude, sorry sweetie but the drummers name is Tommy Alesi, not Jimmy."
3,not so hot,"I really liked Enchant when I first heard them and I think Blueprint is a fine release that really showcased their talent. That said, I must confess that Wounded just bored me. There wasn't a single song that reached out and grabbed me like Thirst or Oasis off of Blueprint. There was such a sameness to all the songs that even after many listenings I still couldn't tell you the name of one. I am still a fan though and just hope that newer releases will recapture that freshness and originality the earlier ones showed."
3,A film for technology buffs,"Have you ever wondered, can someone really design and build a plane from the ground up in just 30 days? This film accounts this interesting problem, starring Bob Cringely. This film contains many interesting obstacles that are overcome with many interesting solutions, with the use of technology and modern-day information. Even though this tape is not for everyone, anyone interested in computers or technology might want to give this tape a look."
4,Worth the price for The Voice alone.,"The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the fact that there could have been more songs on the disc. There is plenty of room. That said this disc is worth it to me for this version of The Voice alone. It has a wonderful expansively panoramic and coherent soundstage that doesn't seem to be found on other albums that contain it. On the Gold 2-disc collection, for example, the sound is slightly crisper but at a huge loss of that gorgeous, sweeping sonic mosaic on this album. In fact the whole disc seems to be a very good remastering job. A trait that seems to be shared by most of the 20th Century Masters/Millennium discs. I consider it a worthwhile addition to my moodies collection."
2,OK for a Knock-Off,"All of these 20th Century ""Millennium"" series are pretty bad. For one thing, it's not the millennium yet except in the world of exploitative marketing. Anyone who can't even count or read a calender shouldn't be assembling compilations of music by bands this worthy. Maybe in 2001 (the actual millenium ), there will be a better collection available."
3,"not a weak track anywhere, but a pretty damn pointless CD anyway","Due to the extremely limited appeal of this CD, you'll most likely be able to get a used copy DIRT CHEAP. By limited appeal, I'm not saying that these songs are bad--in fact, none of them are bad. If you do see this dirt cheap and don't know a thing about the Moodies, it does provide you with a 'quick fix' of the group. But that's really the best that can be said because there are simply too many other Moody Blues compilations around that are easily superior. I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is THE most pointless Moodies' compilation ever released--I do give this one the edge over 1985's similarly scant ""Voices In The Sky"" comp--but still, with the single disc ""The Best of the Moody Blues"" having all of the tracks found here plus 6 more, this ""20th Century Masters"" disc is basically just a waste of space."
1,This Is Not the Best Single-Disc Retrospective,"""Knock, Knock"" (Who's There?) ""Ivana"" (Ivana who?) ""Ivana know vat you vere tinking ven you bought dis CD, dummkopf!""Listen, don't be suckered into buying these chintzy 20th Century Masters products. Nine times out of ten there's a better alternative. That's certainly true here.For a mere $ more you can get The Best of the Moody Blues, which not only includes all eleven songs from the 20th Century Masters CD, but also six additional songs: 1)""Go Now"" from the original Moody Blues (and a top 10 in the U.S. in 1965), 2)""Tuesday Afternoon (Forever Afternoon),"" the second single from Days of Future Passed, 3)""Voices in the Sky,"" 4)""Isn't Life Strange,"" 5)""Blue Guitar,"" a Justin Hayward solo single from 1975 and 6)""Forever Autumn,"" a Justin Hayward single from Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds in 1978. These are all terrific songs and certainly make a better single-disc retrospective."
1,The worst Moodies compilation in existence,"Any, repeat, ANY Moody Blues greatest hits or best of compilation in the world is better than this piece of crap, yet another in the series of ""Millenium"" cd's where 10 or 11 random singles are carelessly thrown onto a cd.Can you possibly take seriously a Moody Blues best-of that includes ""Slide Zone"" and ""Blue World"" and OMITS ""Tuesday Afternoon"" and ""Isn't Life Strange""?! I mean, HELLO! We're lucky they even included ""Nights in White Satin"" at this rate!... Trust me, if you want a greatest hits set for the Moodies, get the ""Best Of"" cd or, even better (if you wanna spend a few extra bucks) the Anthology. This cd is most certainly NOT worth the investment."
5,the great moody blues,never had any moody blues music so only heard on radio and they are still playing concerts today it good
5,"Great sound, good hits:","You will be very pleased with this CD, good sound, plays good, great for the price: Rock on and play it loud:"
1,not worth it,"this game is one of my alltime favorites.i have owned it on sega cd and 3DO. when i saw it for dvd i thought, ""great finally an arcade perfect translation"". boy was i ever wrong. the pauses in the game make it boring and dull.and in certain scenes you used to have to hit the button at the exact right time or you would fail, now you are prompted by a yellow dimond in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. all and all it's not worth the 30 hard earned dollars it costs. pick this one up when it appears in the discount bin for $10"
4,A Great Buy if you Don't already own it,Since the days when Sega CD came out with Dragon's Lair it was a pain in the butt to play because the controls were badly done. The remastered DvD redid the controls and handles great but the whole fun of Dragon's Lair was to go through the game and win. (not to metion purposely dying to see the death scenes). But when you fail it jumps real fast and you barely get a peek on how you die. In the arcade game and Sega CD version you saw a short 5-10 second movie on how you just failed and died. Other than that its great DvD it also works well at parties.
2,"great transfer, but too many pauses while playing game.","Remember Dragon's Lair from the arcade? This is the same game but you play it with your DVD remote control. The video quality is top-notch, but the gameplay leaves much to be desired. I expected the game to pause when you make a wrong move (in order for it to seek the disc for the death scene), but this DVD actually pauses when you make CORRECT moves. The pause is about 1 second long. It makes levels such as the chessboard/knight excruciating painful to sit through. I don't understand why there's a pause if you make a choice whose animation sequence directly follows the move. In short, I'd only recommend this DVD for die-hard Dragon's Lair fans. If Space Ace performance is anything like this DVD's, I'll be sure to skip buying it. What I'd like to see is a re-release of all of the Don Bluth LD games on one DVD, with all of the performance bugs worked out.* the search for the ultimate Dragon's Lair home experience continues..."
1,Broken plastic at the pin,"Opened the box. Plastic at top of the face that holds the pin was broken. Pin fell out. I now have two pieces and an angry little boy....3 days later.I immediately ordered another since the kid was so angry. When it arrived, I looked at it before even cutting the packaging. I can see the band is broken where it connects to lower face of watch where folded back under the watch. So that is 2 of them broken. So you definitely don't want to buy this watch. The kid is using the other one with just the watchface after he tore ofF the other band.... Can't believe that this is still up for sale."
2,Ok product,product looks ok. long handle helps. The screwdriver head could have been more durable. Couple of hard twists kind of scratched off pieces from the head. tried it on my macbook pro screws - not on any hard machinery.
1,Not working for me,This didn't do the job for me: I have a 00 screw in my Nexus One but this screwdriver does not seem to fit even if this is confirmed to be the screwdriver I should use (see [...] ). It seems to big and its head is not as flat as it should.Disappointed.
2,"Good purpose, but Not Study","The purpose is served in that it fit all of the screws that I desired, but it lacked the ability to stand up to very minor use. I used it to take the back off of my MacBook Pro, and after taking off and putting those 15 screws back on, it is slightly bent; that is annoying but not worth my time to return."
4,"Works great, but loses magnetization quick",Worked great for changing out the RAM in my Macbook and HP. The magnetic tip lost it usefulness about half way through the HP job.
3,Does the job,"Thi screw driver does the job for may be a couple of times. The quality is not that great, it is wearing off upon a little bit use. Not like the technicians use in Apple store but okay for price and do a little bit of job. I would recommend a better quality screw driver for long run"
3,Did the job,I used this screwdriver to open my MacBook Pro so I could add more RAM. It did the job but was kind of flimsy. I don't know if I could use it again without the metal twisting out of shape.
4,Wow. It looks just like the one I bought at dollar tree.,"Electricians carry these to terminate electronics in alarm and security systems. I saw a pair at Dollar tree, flat and phillips set. You can probably order at their website if you can't find it in your local branch.The best feature is the rotating cap so you can spin it easily for quick removal."
1,JUST USELESS! do not trust the reviews,It does not fit the macbook pro(mine is 2011 early version).Just waste my time.Do not trust the so called reviews.Look at the pics carefully.Should a cross screwdriver be so sharp??
4,"Good, slightly damaged upon arrival","Good, compact screwdriver. Works well for servicing Macbooks. The only issue I had was that the stem of the screwdriver arrived slightly bent. Not sure if this was an issue with shipping or if it was faulty. Either way, not quite bad enough to send it back."
5,Perfect!,"This was exactly what I wanted. I needed a screwdriver small enough to open up my Macbook so I could clean it out, and this one did it! I loved the fact that the tip of the head is magnetic to grab the small little screws without them dropping and getting lost!"
5,surviving fidelity,THIS BOOK HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY THROUGHOUT MY ORDEAL..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!ITHIS BOOK FELT LIKE IT WAS WRITEN JUST FOR ME.T TOOK ME TRROUGH THE PROPER STEPS FOR ME TO HEAL. I WENT THROUGH THEM ALL AND CAME OUT OK...
3,Nothing really wrong with this book but it won't work for everyone.,This book is one that is filled with assignments for TWO people. It probably would work if BOTH parties would cooperate and do the assignments. It won't work at all if only one person does it.
2,Do they even like LINKIN PARK??????,"Well, out of all of the tribute albums that I've heard this one definately earns the right to be called a complete waste of time and effort. Does the vocalist (who's trying to compare to Mike Shinoda) on the Points of Authority track even know the lyrics?"
1,Just Plain awfull !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this CD is a disgrace to all linkin park fans. It takes good songs and ruins them
1,A Disgrace to all Linkin Park Songs,"To put it short, this CD is horrible. Dont waste your money on it."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CD","Ok, I am a huge fan of Linkin Park, but damn, could this cd be anymore disgraceful? I didn't own it, and now I never will, and I don't think anyone should unless they can't live without every LP item on the market. No one does LP songs better than Linkin Park themselves. You want my opinion, save your money for a LP cd, merchandise, or concert tickets, but don't get this cd, you're gona waste your money."
1,SUCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is terrible,they mustve made this crap in a meat market caus dey butchered it Id like to punch the well ... idiot who did high voltage he deserved to get shocked by high voltage
1,dont bother,this album has got to be the worst tribute to any band of all time. half of these guys dont even sound good. they suck. dont but it.
1,The worst tribute ever.,"The only thing I have to say about the artist/s who made this album, is that they are the most talentless people on the face of this earth and have dishonored Linkin Park fans worldwide by making this horrible ""tribute."""
1,THIS IS SAD,"I am a linkin Park Fan, and this sucks, how dare they take the music from Linkin Park and try to make money off of it.. I would not recommond this to any Linkin Park Fan."
1,un-1337,They sound like linkin park...minus the talent. Buy this CD and forever regret it. It's shameful to see that this filth bears the name Linkin Park. *Sigh*
3,You have to be joking,I mean Linkin Park rules. But they only have like two albums. Now I would say that the second one the best. Dont get me wrong.
1,I can think of some better things to do with my money,"like putting it in a bag and throwing it off a cliff, or shuvveling it out a window"
1,Rename: Insult to Linkin Park,"After hearing about 4 songs I had the urge to trash my media device (I say ""about 4 songs"" because I'd skip the songs midway usually). The vocals were annoying and made me cringe most of the time. The sound/music aspect was good, but it's harder to ruin great music. The vocals were definitely bad though. Another customer rated it as ""karaoke,"" which is a good way to describe it, but I'd add ""BAD Karaoke"" to be more accurate. If you want to hear crappy southern accents singing your favorite songs and/or poor rapping, go ahead and buy this. Otherwise, please don't support this horrid effort of a ""tribute."""
1,WTF??,"Even though I do like LP, they don't deserve a tribute album. I mean, c'mon, they only released 2 CD's (not counting the remix album) and thhey get a tribute album? There's something wrong with this picture. Likn ther previous reviewer said, a band that has been around for quite a while and released at least 6 albums deserves a tribute CD. I'm gonna stop here."
3,Ok for a tribute band,"I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting with this CD. I was fully aware that it was NOT Linkin Park but merely various artists. After the initial shock of some of the vocals I was able to tune out the occasional squawking and really listen. I am a HUGE fan of Linkin Park and my overall opinion is that this is not bad for a tribute to LP. Not great but not bad. I really enjoy some of the remixes that they've done. I think the key is to remember that this is NOT Linkin Park but simply a bunch of guys who really, really like the band and want to pay tribute! I appreciate their efforts!"
1,whats with the versions,"I'll sum up my report on this CD like this. *ahem* Don't buy this crappy CD. the voices are horrible, and the ""version"" thing is REALLY dumb"
1,horrible,This cd is HORRIBLE.I am a big Linkin Park fan.I listened to 1 sample track and came to a decision that it sucks.I listened to With You and the backup vocal person sounds like a freaking girl.This is the worst thing I've ever heard.I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE.
3,It's okay,"I was expecting a lot more because the songs are Linkin Park songs, but the remade tracks by different artists were so-so. Nothing that great. It's fun to always listen to ...I guess the way I would describe it is that other artists are doing ""karaoke"" with Linkin's songs. I think those that are looking for something fresh should look at buying reanimation rather than this CD."
2,"Linkin Park kick ..., but this is a disgrace","Ok, I'm a huge Linkin Park fan, and Hybrid Theory and Reanimation are 2 of my favourite CD's. That being said, this 'tribute' contains all the songs that have been done twice before already, except really bad versions of them. If you're a hardcore fan, you might want to pick this up just cuz it's got the funky beat of all their great songs, but to anybody else it's a real disappointment."
1,wtf...,"What the hell is this, this f#cking sucks! I think this was made by a bunch of hardcore linkin park fans who are amatuers at actually making music itself... horrible.."
1,Horrible,"This Cd is nothing more than some wannabe rockers trying to make some quick cash of the huge success of Hybrid Theory. The most disgraceful [stuff] I ever heard. If you want a good LP tribute, check out the String Quartet Tribute to Linkin Park which can be found on this site as well. As for this CD, it deserves to be smashed to pieces and thrown into a flaming pit."
1,Listen to the other reviews...please,"What an incredible waste of time and money. To purchase this CD is like sticking you finger in a pencil sharpener; you may be curious, but in the end you'll realize that you'll get hurt by buying such an amatuer CD. Please, respect LP and buy their CD. The best LP CD's are Hybrid Theory and Metoria. So take my advice and buy a REAL LP..you will tank me later. =)"
1,what a piece of Crap,"c'mon people, if you buy this, your crazy!!!!! I've only listened to the clips and i think it sucks!!! I reccomend that you buy a REAL Linkin Park CD. Whoever put this pile of junk together is a disgrace to LP and all of it's fans!!!"
1,Can we give this less than 1 star!,"This is the worst effort (if it can be called an effort) of a CD I have ever known, although it's very funny.Even Adam Sandler would be jealous of 'One Step Closer'."
2,Could have been Better,"Could have been Better, but most Tribute albums put the wrong artists on the songs, just listen to any of the songs on the metallica tribute album, they arent good, but with a switching of artists it could have been good"
1,This doesn't make sense,"A tribute to linkin park. Is this a joke? They are an okay band, but they only have one cd. This is ridiculous."
1,Horrible,"Ok first of all Rozz this awful Cd was not made to ""rake in money"" for Linkin Park. I think they can make enought money for themselves. When Hybrid Theory launched they sold 4.81 million copies and was the best selling album of 2001. Im sure their cut of it was plenty. Ok aside from ignorant people (Rozz) who know every band in the world and who influences them, this CD sucks. I listened to the sample tracks and nearly vomited. The songs are repulsive and disgraceful. Linkin Park fans stick to Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, Meteora, and other fine single cds."
4,Very informative and at proper level,It's hard to find certain books geared toward medical professionals that is not written in lay terms. This book isn't the greatest I've seen but it's pretty good at providing the appropriate information at the level a medical professional would understand.
3,Mass medical info,"I am taking my first medic class and purchased the AMLS book for the AMLS cert. It is a very good book. It takes the big medical problems and goes into depth with each. It gets a bit long and drawn out on some things and a few things went over my head, but some good information"
5,The whole story,"If anyone ever felt that their training was all heart attacks, mass casualty events and cervical spine immobilization then this is the book for you. Advanced Medical Life Support isn't actually an advanced life support course in the same vein as Advanced Cardiac Life Support or Advanced Trauma Life Support. It is however a comprehensive book of 'how' and 'why'. This is the text for all of the situations that don't require a C-collar or an AED. The majority of the book is filled with the vague everyday complaints that leave EMTs wondering. There is a lot going on inside the abdomen after all, and this book will help demystify those processes and leave the EMT with as clear a picture as you could hope for without ultrasound. This book is an absolute must for military medics who are responsible for conducting sick call or going on humanitarian missions."
4,Best ALS Review Course,The course (which includes this book) was the best CME I have had in a LONG time -- which covers more than twenty years in EMS.
5,It's all true!,"Yes, this is a 5-star progressive metal CD, even though you never heard of the band and so far as I know they never made another. I rate them right up there with Dream Theater, though their style reminds me more of Ice Age (another great prog metal band). Grab it while you can!"
5,Excellent Prog Metal,"'Insights' is by far one of the best prog albums I have ever had the pleasure of purchasing. Not only are the lyrics well though-out, but the music and technicality are outstanding as well, not to mention gloriously melodic at some parts. If you are a fan of Dream Theater, Ice Age, Dali's Dilemma, Rush, or Enchant, you too should enjoy this wonderous addition to the Magna Carta armory."
5,great dutch progpower.,"Dutch prog with great guitar and vocals in the line of Dream Theater. Both guitarist and singer also appear on the Rush tribute Working Man. It's just fantastic, everything is just perfect. In The Netherlands there's a second album wich is called Divided wich is less Dream Theater and more of a style of their own. Check this one out, it's even better than the first one."
1,Boo Hoo,Never got it. Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo Hoo Boo HooBoo Hoo!
5,gee-gee's review,"i'm a slave fanatic a slave nut,and this album from the beginning to the end is strong.this is without a question the best fungk album ever! buy this album and it will speak for itself. mark adams is the king of bass!"
4,Easy herbs,I grow a lot of herbs and the chopper makes chopping them so much easier. I layer the freshly chopped herbs with Kosher salt in a glass jar with screw top lid and always have herb seasoned salt ready to use in cooking. The mixture last several months.
3,A Little Goes A Long Way,"I think this soup base is good but it's very salty to me. I've used it in casseroles and bean soup and on some cheesy vegetables and while it does taste good, if your recipe calls for salt, I'd watch how much I added because this soup base is pretty salty on it's own.Final impression: I felt the cost I paid was reasonable and the taste is good - not great but it's salty so a little bit goes a very long way. Even using it 2-3 times a month, I doubt I could use up even one jar of this per year. I don't think I would buy again and will be searching for something with a bit more ham flavoring and less salty taste."
5,seasoning,"This product is excellent for seasoning vegetables, without having the ham and fat involved."
3,Good but short (better for advanced beginners and coaches),"I've been playing hockey for a few years and was looking for those little tips that make all the difference. This video has some of those. It seemed oriented more towards beginning players: all the main parts of the shots were discussed, but the small things one learns from perfecting a shot were not discussed. For example, while the body and arm movements of a wrist shot are taught in great detail, little mention is made of the wrists and hands. The video assumes a lot of knowledge sometimes and almost none at other times.The last half of the 35 min. video is a set of drills to improve your shot. More useful for team situations than individual practice.Overall, I think the video is worth it. I found some minor mistakes I was mistaking, and definitely powered up my wrist shot a bit, as well as making it more accurate. The snap shot tutorial was particularly interesting."
5,Strong pop/rock songwriting through out,All the songs here are well written pop / rock pieces. All the songs! A rare event.Vocally and instrumentally the execution is skillful and does not rely on flashy production. Cupcakes - well worth a taste.
3,One Amazing Song,"Track #3, ""Future Girls Future Boys,"" is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. If you don't buy this CD, find a way to own that song."
5,AS GREAT AS THEY ARE LIVE!,"This album is definitly perfect for those misfortunate people who have never seen this band rock it out live. I swear I didn't know who they were (being stuck on the east-side), but I saw them live in Florida and they were just too awesome for words! The cd totally captures their energy, the ripping guitar, and the rhythm that can drive you crazy. You'll be jumping around your stereo thinking your in the club with these guys. All I've got to say is this is such a must have album, and I can't wait for the next. If you like the Smashing Pumpkins, don't expect this cd to sound like them at all. The Pumkins can't compare to these guys. In fact, they could learn a few things from them! ROCK IT OUT CUPCAKES!"
2,Not so exciting,"This stuff is very plain. I know that's what The Mom & Dads took pride in, but still. Anybody that fancies polka would be much better served buying a Frankie Yankovic album."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"It's good quality and a great idea. We love having the time showing on the ceiling so we can see easily the time in the morning. A couple design flaws in my opinion:1. There is no battery backup, and setting the time is not intuitive. Everytime the power goes out, it really takes effort to reset it. Every other clock in our house has a battery backup.2. You can't have it only show the time...it always flips between the time and the temperature. I don't need to know the temperature first thing in the morning, and I feel I'm always waiting for it to flip from the temp to the time in the morning. It's only 5 seconds between the flip, but in the morning, it seems like an eternity. Imagine having a clock that only tells you the time half of the time that you look at it...the other half you have to wait."
1,engineered to last just long enough to be out of warranty,as other reviewers have stated the life expectancy of the projection bulb is approximately 12-18 months--limited warranty expires after 12 months. my clock lasted exactly 14 months and failed in the exact same manner described by everyone else. oregon scientific must have their engineering down to an art!
2,cool but not practical,"This thing looks cool but is not practical. It is hard to set and doesn't have a battery back-up. The projector blocks your view of the base. However, the projected image looks great but is too bright for a bedroom clock. The indoor temperature is a nice feature. I can't believe that Oregon Scientific designed this product without a battery back up or a self setting feature!UPDATE! I am now 2 weeks out of warranty and 2 pixels on the projector are burned out! Oregon Scientific has not replied to my email in a week. Rating should be 1 star now."
1,Better be very cloudy if you want to see this in the day,"I am projecting the time across a 14 foot room indirectly lit by sunlight.No lights are turned on within the room. I have to draw the curtains tosee the time.A plastic lens protector comes glued across the lens. I had to remove theprotector with solvent and even using lens cleaner tissue, the lens appearsto have gotten scratched.I willingly gave up battery backup and atomic time setting but it doesn'tproject well and even the base is dim and hard to read from 10 feet away."
2,"Bright enough, but some design and production problems","As another reviewer noted, it's ridiculous for a clock at this price point not to have a battery backup (or be self-setting, as are all of their other projection clocks). My main issue, however, was with the plastic ""protective"" film over the projection lens. Its glue residue remains on the lens after peeling back the plastic. Soft cloth doesn't remove it. Anything abrasive will scratch the lens. Oregon Scientific support doesn't return emails. Result: the nice bright image remains blurry at any focus."
1,Looses connection frequently,The adapter looses optical connection frequently due to the looseness of the turning/spinning mechanism. I run pure optical and these werebadly needed. I ended up disconnecting them and going back to my old routing. I was really hoping I couldrelieve cable tension with this product. Also when I finally unplugged the adapter the inside metal piece came off and stuckto my existing cable end and was hard to get off. Craftsmanship was not good.
4,gift for my nephew,The DVD seems to be enjoyed by my nephew and was received from the vendor very quickly.
5,my toddler loved it,"my daughter really likes elmo and this dvd was no exception ans she also likes silly mr noodles i loved all the lessons about books, dancing and music"
2,SUCKS!!!,This movie was NOT educational my child cried every time I put the movie in it was a waste of my money.....never again will I buy an Elmo DVD
5,The best Elmo DVD in our house,"We have about 8 Elmo DVDs, and this one is by far the kids' favorite. They especially love the Dancing episode."
4,"My son loves it but it repeats part of the ""What Makes You Happy"" Elmo's World video","My son loves the Elmo's world DVD's so we have a large collection of them. When I purchased this I did not realize that one of the three segments is the same as one of the segments in the ""What Makes you Happy"" Elmo's World DVD. Had I known that I probably would have purchased a different DVD with three segments that he does not already have. The segment that repeats itself is the dancing segment. Anyone with a child who loves Elmo's World knows that you'll end up watching the DVD's over and over again. He doesn't seem to mind seeing the same segment than twice in two videos, but it can drive me crazy. Other than that this is just as good as any of the other Elmo's World DVD's. I like that it introduces books since my son started watching this before he was interested in having us read him any of his books, and now he seems more interested in his books. I highly recommend it if your child likes Elmo."
3,Just ok...,"this is the third Elmo DVD we have purchased for our Elmo-obsessed 18 month old and I have to say it is our least favorite. My husband and I are very disappointed in how the ads for other Elmo-Sesame Street products play automatically with this DVD (as opposed to a preview other products option in the main menu). As to the specific Elmo material, my son doesn't seem as interested in this DVD as he is in the other two - the Great Outdoors and Babies, Dogs and On the Farm. I'm sorry that I can't explain why, to us adults it seems like typical Elmo fare. Having to skip past the ads in the first segment and stop them at the end of the third is what keeps my review at three stars rather than four."
4,There is a difference in Elmo tapes!,"This tape is especially good, even for Elmo videos, which of course we have every one. My 17 month old loves to sing, dance and ""read"", so this video is very entertaining. I also think it is cute, and we try to watch it every other day to break up the monotony of Elmo's World."
5,Great buy!,Some parents seems to forget that a great kids DVD is one that entertains & teach your child. This DVD does that & more... it's also one of my favourites because I try to watch every DVD with my child.
5,Engaging and fascinating,This is a WONDERFUL book - amazing insight into the human condition. Everyone should read this!
1,The New Encyclopedia of Handguns,This book deals more with machine guns and sub machine guns. I was looking for historical information on pistols and revolvers. I gave this book to the local library. Not worth having.
1,Broken,One of the toggles was broken when it arrived (glad I only needed 5). Very old and very dusty.
2,The Singing is Not Very Good,"I have contributed this video to the library because I couldn't stand the singing. Both leads sing uncharacteristically but consistently flat in the early part of the opera. The chorus is limp and other minor parts are are sung with too much wobble to be distinct. The strongest part of the singing is the excellent Lescaut of Pablo Elvira, but it just isn't a big enough part to make up for the rest. The orchestra plays well and the last two parts of the opera are well staged."
2,could have been something better,"I was very excited to listen to this when I purchased it. Although the show got mixed reviews I was pretty sure I would enjoy it because it had Adam Pascal (RENT) and Heather Headley (Lion King) in it. Plus, I loved Elton John's songs in the Lion King. Sad to say, this CD isn't very great. The music Elton John wrote for this is uninspring. It lacks any kind of showstopping tunes and and the songs really don't further the story. It listens more like a regular album with each track as a new pop song. Pascal and Headley have great voices and you can hear why Headley won her recent Tony award. Sherie Renee Scott is completely wasted in the show. She has a great voice but doesn't get good material to work with.Overall, this could have been a great show and Elton John could have written something a lot better."
1,Just Horrible,"I enjoy many different types of musicals from Beauty and the Beast, Annie Get Your Gun, to Jekyll and Hyde, and Joseph.....Dreamcoat.I was so excited to purchase 3 Cd's this past month which were Whistle Down the Wind, Scarlet Pimpernel and this AIDA.I've listened to WDW about 20 times Scarlet Pimpernel about 40 times and AIDA once. I love both my other purchases.Listening to AIDA I found the lyrics terrible and not one song made me want to listen again. While some of the voices on this piece are good, the music just stinks!I was so looking forward to this CD as it appeared great from other reviews, only to be dissapointed. I havn't had the pleasure? of seeing the show.Maybe I'll try listening to it again, it might grow on me, then again, maybe it will just grow mold......."
1,Incredible piece of trash,"I see why people are disappointed with this show. There is nothing original at all: from the bland music to the sets, everything is COPIED. Everything reminds you of OTHER shows. Skip this and get The Lion King. Now THAT's an incredible musical!"
5,"Fortune Favors ""AIDA""",i bought the cd because i was going to be in the high school production when i first listen to it before i read the script i felt i knew the story through the voices and emotions the actors put into their music.
5,On Broadway ...,"Aida restores your faith in the unlimited potential of broaway musicals. The combined genius of Elton John's music and Tim Rice's lyrics leave you feeling like you're bathing in the afterglow of a shooting star - it's absolutely meteoric! Remember the first time you saw the Lion King and the music from ""The Circle of Life"" nearly lifted you off your feet? That's what this cd does, to the tenth power! Each song is an expertly crafted piece of drama and music, and the positive message of siezing your own destiny will get you through those dog days at work. I listened to this cd 7 times in the same day after it arrived at my pad, and it was worth every cent. If you want something to inspire your spirit and make your brain bristle, invest in this compact disc. You'll be glad you did."
1,DRECK!,This is truly one of the worst musical theatre scores in recent years. Elton John makes ALW sound like Sondheim. This is a dreadful show which has been a long time hit with tourists from Podunk.
1,Like every other Musical,"There used to be something called theatre. Disney, has destroyed the concept of theatre and ""Aida"" is the worst show they have put out yet. ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" musically are much better than this.After hearing Verdi's ""Aida"" this does not compare. But even if you are not a fan of opera and a fan of musicals, this CD sounds like ever-typical musical, such as ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and all of the rock musicals. The music itself is repetitive and the voices for the most part are not very good. The show lasts on its name and the people who produced it, Disney. Tim Rice and Elton John has destroyed the original opera in all the ways possible, and turned the once loved love story into a show where you want Aida to die, so you can leave. The music is unemotional and when they are in the tomb, dying, the audience does not feel a bit bad for any of them. I beg you, Save the [money] and get a real peace of music."
5,Wonderful,"This is not only an AMAZING musical, but also a wonderful soundtrack. It has a heartfelt and very moving story and score and extremely complicated to put on. Also, in reference to another reviewers remarks, unless you happen to be from my high school, IC in Memphis, you are sadly mistaken about being the first to get the rights first in the nation. Today was the last performance and our cast did a wonderful job in showing just how the music in Aida can apply to all generations and move the audience."
1,Amazing...amazingly BAD!,"Indeed, as many, many reviewers have pointed out, there's nothing original in the score, and the singing, led by pop (not musical theater) wanna-be Heather Headley, leaves much to be desired. Why get the copycat of The Lion KIng? Just buy the original Lion King CD and you'll be more than satisfied!"
4,Overall Good Recording,"Aida is not your normal recording. It has a variety of different styles of music in it. Heather Headley sings the title role beautifully...so well that she won the Tony for it, but anyways, Adam Pascal does a good job with his role as Radames. The only thing that I didn't particularly care for was that his voice in my opinion isn't suited for musical theatre. Adam is actually a rock singer, but he still does a very good job in his leading role as does Sherie René Scott. The music itself is beautiful by Elton John and Tim Rice (also won the Tony for best new music). This recording is definatly one of the better recordings in my collection. I would certainly say that Aida is worth buying!"
1,"Horrible musical, horrible recording","Heather Hedley's non-musical theater voice is bad here as in all her other recordings, and the voices of the other cast members don't make up for it. The unoriginal music will annoy you, the lyrics torture you, and you'll want to throw this in the trash after listening to the first few songs. I'd give this a zero rating if that option was available. Don't bother planning to see this and don't waste your money on the recording."
1,BAD! BAD! BAD!,"I can't believe a show could be this bad! The music has absolutely no originality and Heather's voice is amazingly...ANNOYING!As one reviewer has said, this show has a major identity crisis. The voices of the lousy actors singing the lousy songs don't make listening to this terrible CD any better.Skip this one and spend your money on more worthwhile Broadway CDs."
1,The worst POP concert I've ever seen!,This is a pop concert that masquerades as musical theater. And not even a good one at that. The voices aren't good and the lines so trite I wanted to laugh while the actors were delivering them seriously.Just go see The Lion KIng. Nothing beats the original.
1,This show is a dog.,"I saw this show on Broadway last Saturday night. I want my $190 back. The story is laughable -- they have turned Aida into The Little Mermaid (starcrossed kids who can't marry for love -- yawn) -- and the songs are a bunch of banal pop tunes. Heather Headley is wonderfully talented but Adam Pascal (whom I enjoyed in Rent) doesn't sing, he just screams. I was bored stiff and could hardly wait to leave the theater. And the CD? It perfectly captures every bland and uninteresting detail of the score. Save your money -- Music Man and Kiss Me Kate are much, much better."
1,Possibly the worst soundtrack I've ever listened to,"Sorry, Aida fans, but after listening to the CD, I must say that all the reviewers who say that this is horrible are correct. The score smacks of un-originality - the tunes are reminiscent of other movie recordings such as The Lion King. The songs and lyrics are uninspiring at best. And the fact that a weak cast leads this soundtrack doesn't help at all. Heather is not a good singer and her style is not for musical theater at all; she sounds like one of those American Idol contestants.You're better off purchasing the soundtracks of other Broadway shows. There are MANY of them available on amazon.com"
3,Some good some bad,When I frist got this CD and when I saw the show I really loved it but now It is just Ok to me.There are something's I like and there are something's I do not like.The one thing I really like is Some of the singing but the music is way to poppy for Musical's.
3,Nice Ear Candy,"I was put off by this show basically after hearing ""My Strongest Suit"" and then I connected this show to ""The Lion THING"" which I detest. I dearly love Elton and thankfully these sound bytes helped me overcome my own prejudice -- plus a great price.The best part of the cd, for me, are the last four songs. When I come home, they are the first things I want to hear. I Know the Truth - touching hindsight, beautiful melody; Elaborate Lives with Ms. Headley taking the lead is WAY better than the first version. Enchantment Passing is just that -- 52 seconds of bliss. Ms. Scott gets to show the softer side of her voice with the closing reprise of Every Story is a Love Story.I like the ballads, they speak of Elton. I agree with the one reviewer who said the few weak lyrics are over shawdowed by the truly wonderful lyrics. Only one shock/mock line per song, please. However the world needs such beauty during times like these."
5,You *MUST* Buy This CD,"I was lucky enough to see this fabulous show in March of this year. I was totally blown away. Adam Pascal, Heather Headly, & Sherie Rene Scott are an absolute DREAM CAST. The performances are powerful, passionate, and breathtaking. I was worried that the recording wouldn't live up to the power of the live show.....but when I picked up my copy last night.... my fears quickly vanished. WOWOWOWOW! If you like musicals, (even in the slightest) you will LOVE this CD. Elton John's wonderful score & Tim Rice's BRILLIANT lyrics ((TONY AWARD WINNING Score & Lyrics, may I add)) make this the most memorable Broadway hits since ""Rent"". You will NOT be disappointed."
1,"Bad, overrated copycat!","Songs and music have no originality, and the voices (especially Heather's) are bad.Get The Lion King instead. Now, THAT's an album and a show that's worth your money!"
1,Horrible!,"This is a pop album that masks itself as musical theater. The music, which reminds listeners of OTHER shows instead of directing attention on this one, smacks of a major lack of originality, and the singers, particularly Heather (who seems to want to sound more like Whitney Houston or some American Idol contestant rather than a theater actress), don't make the recording any better.This is the worst musical theater CD I've listened to to date."
2,Missing a track,"This CD was missing a track from the album! It was supposed to have 22 tracks, but the CD only had 21."
4,"From Verdi to Sir Elton, from Ghizlanzoni to Sir Tim","I have been a fan of the Verdi Aida for some time, so I had to see what my favorite librettist and one of my favorite pop musicians did to it. I must say, i was pleasantly surprised. The story was changed a bit, and i guess the show has a book I don't know about, but everything came out clear. People who do not know Elton John's style of writing pseudo- recititive in verses to make the musical hook even more interesting or Tim Rice's style of lyrics which look trite on the page but ALWAYS hide some deeper meaning (usually something pessimistic, though) might be a little turned off. However every song is exquisite, although the show is a little heavy on the slow songs. ""Like Father"" is classic Elton John, while ""Every Story"" is classic Rice. A good blend, and i hope to see more collaborations between the two in the future."
2,A pop score masquerading as a theatre score.,"Elton John has deserved most of the fame he has earned in the pop music arena. He has proven with Aida, however, that he does not remotely belong on Broadway. While the cast (including Rent's Adam Pascal and Tony-winning newcomer Heather Headley) give some wonderful performances, the material simply has no reason for being presented in the theater. Hearing modern pseudo-country-rock songs come out of characters who are supposed to be living in ancient Egypt is anachronistic and ridiculous. The music seldom serves the drama, and never seems completely appropriate for whatever is going on onstage. If you like Elton John, you'll probably like Aida, but if you're a theatre fan, please pass it by, and search out something more deserving of Broadway success than the music in this ""corporate designed to be long-running""--but emotionally meaningless--hit."
3,It's just ok.,"The only real selling point for this album is Heather Headley. Don't get me wrong: the story is moving (and old), and there are some other good singers on the album. But the music is a little strange and, while Adam Pascal was fine in Rent, he's no Broadway actor/singer."
1,Umm.... Yeah,"Is it possible to give negative stars? This is the most sappy music I've ever heard, and all of the songs begin to sound identical if you listen long enough. Verdi must be rolling over in his grave. Rather than see Elton John's production or buy this soundtrack, treat yourself to the original opera."
5,"Great show, great CD.","I ordered the CD several weeks before I went to see the show, and I found both absolutely wonderful. Heather Headley is a rare talent. Those who did not enjoy either the CD or the show must have been in a bad mood or something because there is nothing bad to be said for either the music, the show, or the performers, and the scenery and costume design were both fabulous. I would go back to see it in a minute if given the opportunity. Wonderful, wonderful show and CD. Unless you are hypercritical and can't relax and enjoy a good thing, don't hesitate to buy the CD or go see the show. You won't regret it if you're in the right spirit for it."
4,The music is good,"From all the negative talk I was very suprised with the CD. Most of the songs were wonderful and the leads all have amazing voices. Heather Headley is amazing, she is a wonderful singer. Her voice was just as good as it was in Lion King.Overall it wasn't the most moving or the best musical of all time, but I think in its own right it was a very nice musical showing the power of love and that deserves some respect."
4,gellio said...,"gellio ""This work ...will never survive long on Broadway.""It is still playing and going strong. So much for fortune telling.BTW Notice your ""beautiful"" musical Jane Eyre sure didnt last long...."
5,Simply Fantastic!!,"I recently saw ""Aida"" at the Kennedy Center, and I knew from the moment the performance began that I would be purchasing this CD. This is a true work of art and worth every penny!! I love ""Every Story is a Love Story."" Anything that Tim Rice and Elton John compse is simply fantastic!! Even my boyfriend truly enjoyed ""Aida,"" and we have considered seeing it again, but in the meantime, we'll have to relive the musical through the CD."
2,Not Impressed,"The CD and show are rather bland and are really not worth investmenting in. Tim Rice's lyrics always seem to be silly and quite simple in most of the musicals he's done and ""Aida"" proves to be no exception. I am a fan of Elton John, but he clearly did not come through in this production. Most of the music sounds the same and a lot of the songs about Nubia just renstate the same idea over and over again that Aida needs to protect her land. There are a couple of great songs such as ""Written in the Stars"" and ""A Step to Far"", but other than that there are not any other stand out tracks.The show itself is quite amazing if you ignore the music (which, is pretty awful considering ""Aida""'s a musical). The sets are fabulous and the dancing is just fantastic. If there was a category for that the show would get five stars.Overall, I think ""Aida"" had a lot of potential but came up short."
4,AIDA IS AWESOME!,"I think that this CD is a HUGE improvement from the lackluster poppy all star concept album. Heather Headley and Sherie Rene Scott are two incredible singers. It's no wonder that Heather won the Tony, and that Sherie won the Clarence Derwent award for most promising female performer. Heather has a beautiful, powerful voice and really gets to show it off in a couple of numbers: The Gods Love Nubia and Dance of the Robe. Sherie really has range as she goes from a touching ballad to an outragously funny in Every Story is a Love Story to My Strongest Suit. Adam Pascal is good too in his performance but he sometimes comes off as a bit to rock n' roll-ish. A couple of numbers really don't fit in, Another Pyramid and Like Father Like son. I didn't care for either of these in the show either. The show itself is amazing and if you have the chance to, go see it. It's wonderful no matter what the nay-sayers claim. Aida is a great cast album and an even better show."
1,The WORST soundtrack I've ever listened to!,"No originality, no originality, no originality.Heather's voice is bad, bad, bad.The songs lack charm, lack beauty, and lack sense.Yes, an ABSENCE of enchantment passing through! Don't waste your time and money."
4,"Not a masterpiece, but still an awesome entertainment!","I caught the show a few days ago and I can tell you, this is not another Rent or Les Miz...but it's still an awesome entertainment and isn't it actually the broadway showbiz is all about? It's something much better than what some critics make you believe. To say the least, it's an eye-popping visual delight and it still has Adam Pascal in it. The dialogue is a bit cheesy but the delivery of the cast was flawless.And the music truly grows on you. The Original broadway cast has three perfect leads. Sherie Renee Scott, Heather Headley, and Adam Pascal are just perfect for their respective parts. And I confess I really didn't care for the music that much but I assure you it gets better and better.Try listening to it! You won't regret it. The music is quintessential Elton John, so if you don't like him, better stay away."
5,Music for the heart,"I am a big fan of musical theater but I often have to see the musical before I truly fall in love with the music. There were two musicals in the past that I fell in love with before seeing them, they were Les Miserable, and Miss Saigon. Now I am adding Aida to that list. I first got the Aida cd that had popular recoding artists singing their version of the songs and I really didn't enjoy that. For Christmas I recieved the original cast recording. One day I was cleaning my house and I put the cd into my stereo. Well I got a lot of cleaning done that day because I think I played the cd 5 or 6 times. It has been several years since a new musical has touched me in the way this musical has."
1,"After Aladdin and Mulan, this show up for special DVD next?","Aladdin and Mulan have just released their new 2-disc special edition DVDs. This movie, The Lion King should be next. Among the memorable numbers here is The Circle of Life, which has become one of Elton John's biggest hits...Excuse me? This is NOT The Lion King? But the songs sound exactly the same!Oh, this is musical theater -- you mean, a real, Broadway production??? You must be kidding!!! There's nothing that sounds close to musical theater here! In fact, this is as pop and Disney as any show gets!Really? This is NOT the good animated movie I've seen about lions? Oh, so you mean this is THAT show dubbed as one of the worst musical ever staged on Broadway, with one of the worst cast recordings ever made? And the show has closed? Oh, not surprising then..."
4,Scott and Pascal Make It Worth Buying,"Not the best musical ever, certainly not another Wicked or Rent, but not as bad as most of these reviews are making it out to be. The soundtrack, while rather bland at times, has a few stand-out songs like ""Every Story is a Love Story"" and ""My Strongest Suit."" The CD is worth buying just for those two songs. I was personally completely unimpressed by Headley, but completely fell in love with the emotional sound of Sherie Rene Scott's voice. Also a good performance by Adam Pascal, but not his best."
1,"A bad POP concert, indeed!","There's nothing theatrical about this ""musical."" It's just a compilation of copied pop tunes performed by non-singers. The show is bad, but this soundtrack (this doesn't deserve the term ""cast recording"") is worse. Don't waste your money!"
2,"Laughable Lyrics, Repetitive Tunes but wonderful performers","Elton John's music is Very unoriginal and Tim Rice's lyrics switch from pretentiously over-sentimental to Disney cliches. The one thing that makes this cd worth listening to is the three leads: Adam Pascal, Heather Headley, and Sherri Rene-Scott. I agree with many people when they say ""It should be a rock concert... not a musical!"""
4,Simply Beautiful--a masterpiece,"Having just seen the show today, I am still on a running high from seeing such a spectacular show, and bought the soundtrack at the theatre during the intermission.The play itself is a thing of beauty--the sets, costumes, dance and songs bring you to a catharsis of emotion--upbeat and fast-paced at times, funny and satiric at others, and unbearably tragic near the ending.Some of the magic is lost on CD, I must admit. It doesn't have the ""live"" feeling you get from watching it incorperated with the sets and choreography. But the songs still shine through.Adam Pascal, who I have been a fan of since his RENT-days, is great as Radames. Heather Hedley's voice is beautiful, and Sherie Rene Scott is wonderful as Amneries; the beauty-queen princess who reveals her backbone as the play goes on.Elton John's influence in the show is as blatant as his name above the show title on the Marquis--but thats just fine. He and Tim Rice did a great job with this show."
5,Best Musical Ever!,"Wow, wow, wow!!! I love AIDA! EJ and TR did a fantabulistic job! If you like the music, see it live, absolutely amazing. Not Me and A Step Too Far rock. The voices are just perfect. Heather Headley and Adam Pascal are superb. Nothing can top this!"
2,"Boring, indeed","There's a quick full frontal of the teen girl, but that's about as erotic as this 1988 French film gets. It's a coming of age tale, but we never really care about any of the characters because the script is so solemn and dull. Drones on for almost 2 hours, as well. Not great."
1,Bad Movie!,"This move was a complete waste of time and money!Talk about a build up to a let down ending... This movie is not erotic. In fact, it's not even entertaining. I thought the French were better at making this kind of movie... I guess not though."
5,classic,"Great product perfect condition, finally got to see a rare childhood favorite in its original form. Recommended highly and will be collecting the rest soon."
5,Randy Travis puts out great Albums,"This is another great album put out by Randy Travis. I keep loosing (or friends keep borrowing) my Randy Travis greatest hits albums, this album has most of his greatest hits on there, plus a lot of new music.Great Buy"
5,"Fine quality, works like original SONY","Saved a bundle of money on this. Works just like the SONY brand. Be careful, others do not. Fast service from vendor too."
5,Works Well but Not the Battery in the Photo,"I purchased this battery as an extra battery for my Sony DSC-T5 compact digital camera. The 2 Sony brand batteries that I have owned for the last 5 years have held up well until recently. Lately, they have not been holding the charge quite as long. This new CTA one, after months of use, appears to be holding up the same as those did, but at a lower cost than the Sony brand. So I recommend it.Note: The battery that I received is not the battery in the Amazon picture. My battery has a white label that says ""CTA FOR SONY Li-ion BATTERY"" on it. No big deal though. Actually it is easier to see with the white label."
5,Great for custom builds,"Not much to say about this. It straps easily onto your wrist and clips onto the case. We don't intentionally try to create electricity, so I can't say how well it works in that aspect, but it was an inexpensive little thing for a little extra piece of mind in a valuable custom build!"
3,"Tight Fit for an Adult Male, Otherwise Very Nice","It is a good strap with a good length / tension alligator clip to provide grounding on your computer frame. The velcro strap is nicer than some wrist bands which have elastic bands because it can more snugly fit more people (i.e., doesn't slide up and down your forearm). For me it is almost too snug, however. The package says ""one size fits all"", but I am just under 6 feet tall and of medium build and it barely got around my wrist enough to lock the velcro strap in place. So if you are over 6 feet tall or have large wrists you probably want to try something else."
3,Static Wrist Strap With Ground Wire,"Cables Unlimited ACC-1400 Anti Static Wrist Strap With Grounding WireThe Grounding Wire should have a spring loaded plug terminal the size of the grounding terminal on a standard three prong cable. The above mantioned product can not be pluged directly into the ground socket, it is of smaller diameter. I regret having spend the price I did and not be compleatly satisfied. Thank you for asking for my opinion.David Nakov"
2,Poorly Made,"The radio has a pretty good tuner and its nice being able to tune in .05 Mhz increments (e.g. 89.45 Mhz for our local PBS radio station). My C Crane radio has spent almost its whole life on the refrigerator, with probably only 8 trips to live by the washing machine where I fold my laundry, and work on bicycle parts.Despite the fact that I seldom move this radio, the LCD display went bad after 18 months and now I cannot see anything while tuning. Moreover, one of the springs in the battery compartment broke off and now its quite difficult to remove and change batteries. And, this is after recharging the batteries maybe 10 times total in the life of the radio.Tuner quality gets a 5. Tunes like the $130 radio that it is.Build quality gets a 1. Built like a $13 radio, seriously.overall quality is 2.5, which I rounded down to two stars."
1,LCD failures,"I bought one of these when they first came out and it worked fine enough. Then my wife wanted a radio for the kitchen and I got the silver one. The LCD's on both of these went bad after the warranties were up of course. I can's use the original at all because of it and the silver edition is almost unviewable. The settings are not intuitive so keep the book handy. The handle, of course, is awfull. The preset buttons are noisy. I sometimes wake my wife up changing stations using an earphone at bedside. Something this expensive should have a remote. I bought these from the company and got no reply from an email I sent about the LCD failure quite a while ago. It has been a couple of years since I bought the last one. Whether or not C Crane addressed the LCD problem I don't know."
1,CC Radio is a poor choice,"I have two CC radios, both of which failed shortly after the warranty lapsed.Both of them had extreme difficulty with intermittant LCD display failures, and ultimately both radios reached the point where they would not even power up.I know other people that have had similar experience with the CC, and also with other Sangean radios. Everyone tells me ""buy a Sony."""
1,"Only Used Gently, then Died!","Bought several years ago. Had it in bedroom on side table. Rarely used. (It still looks like it came out of box). Alarm feature okay, sound was good. Suddenly would NOT power up. Called Crane, attendant advised to try this and that. Still not powering up. Only option, send it in for Repair, for a mere ($59) plus I pay the shipping to them. Not happy camper here. If Crane doesn't stand behind their products better, than business will not stand by them. Save your money and buy a SONY. Very unhappy."
2,Exact same troubles with our CC Radio,I had no idea that the issues we are having with our CC Radio were so epidemic. LCD display is intermittant and the preset buttons are flaky. And after reading all these reviews I've no intention of sending it for a rebuilt radio...just to have the same issues return at a later date. How many years have these problems been known about this flawed design? It's simply planned obsolescence. They won't see another dime from us.
2,Disappointment,"I bought this radio approximately four years ago and wanted to share my thoughts.Plusses:Preset buttons, on/off button, weather alert button on top of radio easy to find and use.Easy tuning with automatic scan or large fine tuning knob.Weather alert feature.Weather band.Digital tuning.Solid case.Minuses:Digital display went awry after two years. Impossible to read.Speaker died after 4 years; had to be replaced.Preset buttons do not always work, ""finicky.""Hard to use some buttons on the front.Reception not that much better, if at all, than cheaper radios.Sound quality not better, if at all, than cheaper radios.Overall, a disappointment when considering price paid and advertised claims."
1,Expected much more,"For the price I expected a radio of exceptional design and engineering. I've had my radio for over a year and it is on now ALL the time. It HAS to be, because the power/sleep button froze just after the warrantee ran out. This necessariy means I can't use the alarm or the weather alert function (since they are turned off by the self-same power button). I'll admit, the tuner programming buttons are helpful, but the fm antenna is the same old inflexable telescoping that can easily be bent or broken off. The am reception, to my thinking, is really no better than cheaper radios. The tv band is a nice addition, but most of the interesting stations are on UHF (beyond channel 13) which this radio can't receive. And, for the money, this radio should have LED buttons that would enable easy operation in the dark. In general I advise you to save your money."
2,LCD a BIG Liability - Wait for better Guarantee,"I own one CC Radio where I can't even read the LCD since it's garbage. I must tune in the blind until I hit the right station. I contacted them and never received a response. Same thing happened to my father's CC Radio. I'm never buying another until they fix this problem and improve their attitude toward customers. Too bad, this is a great radio otherwise. Until the fix, do not buy this product. Sangean produces their radios. Do others have this problem with other Sangean products?"
2,LED and WX band problems,"I purchased this radio about 5 years ago. It worked perfectly for the first two years. Then the WX band (weather band) stopped working. I finally ""fixed"" it by giving the radio a hard whack in the area of the power button. So now, the WX band works about 50% of the time, and the other 50% I can get it to work with 1 or 2 whacks near the power button. I also have the disappearing LED problem (maybe partly due to the whacks). In my observations, both the WX failures and the disappearing LEDs occur when the ambient room temperature gets into the upper 70's F. (The second floor of my Cape Cod gets a little warm in the summer.) I am not one to fuss with contacting manufacturers and dealing with return shipping, etc., so I decided to live with the problems until I run across a different radio."
3,Quality Control Problems,"Like many of the other reviewers here, I bought this radio for the touted excellent AM radio reception. It does a better job than most radios in the crowded Los Angeles bandwith. Unfortunately after about one year the radio no longer gets AM reception. This is due to the fact that the button that switches frequencies is broken and apparently FM is the default. When I contacted C Crane about the problem they said it could be fixed for approx 50 dollars. If I thought there would be no other problems with the radio I would repair it. But after reading about the display issues, etc., I suspect that this could be the first of many problems. The radio does have excellent FM reception and the stereo is high quality when played through the headphone jack. I think I will keep it as an FM radio and purchase a less expensive replacement."
3,Please fix this (potentially) great radio!,"I own two of these radios. I use them all the time and I would gladly buy two new CC Radios if Sangean would just FIX THE DAMN THING. The other reviewers have it right. It does funny things...the memory buttons don't work right half the time, the display fades in and out, it turns itself on even even when not set to do so. But it has great sound, runs forever on a set of batteries, and doesn't cost much."
2,Same problem..over and over,"I have had two CCRadio Plus units for several years. I think the reception & sound quality are terrific. However, the digital tuning and clock fail and it is impossible to tune the radio or set the clock. Both units failed in the same way. When the first radio failed, C Crane replaced it...it failed in the same way. The second unit failed and was repaired at MY expense only to have it fail again. The kitchen unit is locked into one station which we listen to over breakfast. The bedside unit will not auto-tune & with care I can tune manually...often the readout is scrambled so it's blind tuning. I don't understand how the same problem, reflected in all the reviews has not been corrected. I also think that expecting the customer to pay for a recognized design flaw is simply awful."
1,Don't Buy A CC Radio,"Listening to all the hype by Art Bell and George Noori, I was taken in. I bought the original CC Radio, and after app 16 months the LCD went out. C Crane charged me to repair it, plus postage to and from their shop.Another year or so, and the LCD crapped out again. I contacted C Crane and they stated that parts are no longer available but offered me a $40.00 credit towards a new radio. I did some research and found something I thought would be nice, and the $40.00 credit will not work when I try to order.I have a 22 year old Sony AM-FM dual cassette player in my garage that stays on almost constantly (except when the wife unplugs it) and it still works, even plays the cassettes.Stay away from C Crane, CC Radios, and anything from Sangean!!!"
2,CC Radio Plus a Disappointment,Several factors make this Radio a little disappointing. The various settings such as timer clock frequency etc.are very difficult and time consuming to program. I am still unable to get the timer on timer off working 100%. A call to C Crane was no help. The reception is not as good as my 40 year old GE. I have tried the suggestion on the outside antenna which caused a better signal however with noise and interferance with other stations. All in all to me it is very over rated.
2,"Great radio, but.....","I have had three of these radios over the years, and find that they provide excellent reception. However, I have had a serious problem with all three; the screen gradually becomes unreadable, with various parts dropping out until little or nothing is left. Now, to be fair, my problem occurred on earlier versions of this radio, and they may have resolved the issue in the current version. But my faith in progress does not extend to my buying one of the new ones."
1,QUALITY PROBLEMS,I have two CC radios. Both are beyond warranty and both have non functioning LCD displays. One of the radios will no longer turn on. C Crane Co will gladly fix both for 25 dollars apiece plus shipping. I love radio and was searching for a quality unit. This is not that radio.If C Crane spent more time and effort to insure quality and less time and money on advertising their products would be worth buying.
1,Not worth the price tag at all,"I had this radio shipped from the USA to the UK so that I could pick up AM reception in England from RTE, the Irish broadcaster. A regular medium wave radio can get weak reception in the UK from Ireland anyway, but after all my expense, (and the addition of the completely useless Terk antenna), the reception I got was still very poor. So, I bought a GE superadio for a whole lot less money and it gets me perfect reception. Don't buy this radio for AM reception improvement, get a GE superadio instead."
2,LCD FAILURE AFTER FOUR YEARS,"I too have had a CC Radio Plus for approximately four years. I had excellent reception, but the LCD display has failed making it useless as far as I'm concerned. I initially received the radio as a Christmas gift about four years ago. The first one I received did not play at all and had to be returned for a replacement. The replacement was promptly received with minimal hassle, but now the LCD display has failed. This looks like an engineering failure to me based upon the number of LCD failures I see documented here. It's too expensive if it only lasts 4 years."
2,Vanishing LCD,This would be a four star radio if the LCD panel worked. It crapped out after about a year. What good is it if you can't tell what radio frequency your on ! Now I just keep the thing on my favorite station and leave it there. The best thing about this radio is the weather alert.
2,CCrane Radio is problematic.,"C Crane CCRadio Plus Multiband Portable AM/FM/Weather/TV Band Radio, BlackMy CCrane was purchased in 2000 and recently returned from its third retrip from Ca. The first when I bought it and the second for the LCD repair. Finally this week the high maintenance radio with noisy preselects returned from a speaker problem repair and I find the battery box (I hope this is the problem) is not working. I have not recommended this radio for many years and this year have bought a standby radio that is so far good. It is the Sangean PR-D5.Too bad I paid so much for the CCrane and two repairs. If I return it one more time it will be a $400 radio!"
3,"Works, but terribly assembled even by chinese standards.","Voltage converters are very basic, just a transformer, so its hard to mess them up, but when this item arrived the transformer inside was loose. I oped the case to tighten the screws (one was totally stripped), and the shrink wrap on most of the wires had moved exposing bare wires all over the place, apparently no one ever shrank the shrink wrap. With most of the soldering joints exposed i was also able to see what a bad job they did soldering the wires. This voltage converter looked like it had been thrown together in one minute."
1,Yet another ...frisbee...,"How do these guys look at themselves in the mirror? This is the STYNX half of the ""Arch Allies"" CD from 2000 and nothing more.This band lost all credibility, class and relevance on June 5, 1999, the last day of Dennis DeYoung's tenure...Utterly reprehensible."
1,What is the point of releasing this?,"With the exception of the horrid ""Everything is Cool"" and a painful to listen to version of ""Lorelei"", this is the same album as the Styx side of the Arch Allies CDs released last year. Can we please here some new music from these guys? It's bad enough that they keep releasing live compellations, but now they are releasing repackaged CDs of the same live performances. How can anyone take this line-up seriously if they can't break the links to the DeYoung era music. Give us something original."
2,At the River's Edge: Live in St. Louis ~ Styx,"this is not so bad, but the songs of Dennis DeYoung are bad, because Lawrence Gowan sings on them. He can't sing half as good as Dennis. The rest of the band plays good, but they should not do Dennis's songs live without Dennis. Lorelei doesn't sound so good either, James Young used to be a good singer, but not anymore. Tommy Shaw sounds very good here. Edge Of The Century doesn't sound so good. It kinda sucks. I like the studio version a lot more. So if you want a live album, then you must buy Return to Paradise."
2,"If You No Longer Want DeYoung in the Band, then Act Like It","Seriously...Gowan is ok, but he's no DeYoung. If they want to do Styx minus DeYoung, then do Styx minus DeYoung songs. Last time I saw DeYoung live, he didn't sing any Tommy Shaw or James Young songs.It's not that I dislike Gowan...he's good. When I saw Styx live with him, it was a great show. Gowan has a lot of charisma, and a keyboard that spins, but the DeYoung songs were off, because he wasn't DeYoung, and that kind of ruined it for me. Maybe ditching the DeYoung stuff and introducing us to some Gowan originals would be better."
3,YET ANOTHER LIVE CD,"Styx is back, with another new live cd, sort of. The only thing new about this cd, is, Everything Is Cool, my second favorite song from their BRAVE NEW WORLD cd, the first being Goodbye Roseland. Rest of the cd comes from the double cd that they and REO SPEEDWAGON did together- ARCH ALLIES. Is it worth buying? Yes if your a diehard STYX fan like me, or if you don't own ARCH ALLIES. BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE LIVE CDS. DON'T REALESE ANOTHER ONE, UNTILL AFTER YOUR NEXT STUDIO CD."
1,4 Live Albums in 4 Years... Ugh!,"Ok, Styx, enough is enough! This is the 4th live album since 1997 and is getting old! While a live version of ""Everything is Cool"" is neat, it is not worth buying this album for. JY's version of ""Lorelei"" is terrible as is ""Heavy Water."" Save your money. The only real live album by Styx is ""Return to Paradise""!"
5,Quality Beach Towel,"This is a nice, plush beach towel with vibrant colors. Nice large size.Great buy for a baseball fan"
5,teenage memory,"the andrew sisters were a wonderful trio and you don't get music like this any more. the blending was fantastic and brings back memories from my teens.i like very little moise that is produced today so i am glad that amazon sells music that i enjoy and can listen to. keep up the good work amazon, marsha"
5,Well put together,You only need a buzz from the sounds of propeller driven planes above or the ring of a bell from a ship departing port for the high seas for combat to complement this collection.....
1,Won't take it back if it does not fit,"I purchased one of cover king's covers for a different brand car and it did not even come close to fitting and because it was a ""custom"" cover, they would not take it back or make it right. So I have an expensive dust collector in the garage right now. Just a caution to anyone considering a custom cover from cover king purchased through auto barn. I'll never do business with either company again for any reason."
3,'Tales From Yesterday: Yes Tribute' (Manga Carta) Various Artists,"Was never even aware of this 13 track Yes tribute CD release until I stumbled across a super-low priced copy.As for tribute ablums go, it's decent. I still say,there are simply too MANY tribute CD's out there. Tunes I dug the most here are Robert Berry's re-working of ""Roundabout"",World Trade's ""Wonderous Stories"" (very well done),Enchant's ""Changes"" and Jeronimo Road's contribution of ""Starship Trooper"". One thing I'll say about each and every artist on this CD,they KNEW plenty (enough,anyway)about Yes to turn in a good tribute title. Not bad at all."
1,Something in the punchbowl,"I bought this hoping to hear re-workings of the originals, but instead found attempts to mostly re-create the songs note-for-note. The only real exception is Robert Berry's version of ""Roundabout"". He actually took some time and re-composed this song, and the result is a completely different yet interesting version.I find the rest of this CD to be embarrassingly painful to listen to, and recommend that you surf swiftly past it. My only comfort is listening to the originals after putting this CD on. Similar to the good feeling you get after ceasing to hit yourself in the head with a hammer.You're right-I didn't like this one."
3,"Some good, some I don't like quite as much","There's a mix of some really good covers and there's some where the vocals are grating because they are closer to something you'd hear from Deep Purple or Guns'n'Roses. The actual musicianship overall is excellent, with some interesting variations and some that sound very close to the original songs. If it wasn't for some of the singing on some of the songs, I would rate this much higher. As it is I regret buying this music because I'm not sure how much I'll actually listen to it."
3,"Turn of the century, and that's about it...","In all honesty, the only piece that I consider to stand out within the album is the version that Annie Haslam (former Renaissance voice) and Steve Howe (Yes' guitar man) put together around the classical 1977 Yes tune ""Turn of the Century."" The rest of the pieces are either identical covers of the original Yes songs or arrangements I didn't quite like as much.However, Yes fans might be more willing to give it a chance."
5,Great Product.,"I use this in my 07 Toyota Sienna.It fit right into the box in-front of the passenger seat above the glove box.I have a crazy setup installed with 3 video headrests (with built in DVD) and another video screen in the front mirror (with rear view camera) and each one can watch what they want.I'm using 2 inputs (connected to the back of the pioneer), One is an ipod video that always stays in the car and the other is a portable GPS that also always stays in the car, the third input (in the front) is being used for Iphone and anything else.The reason I love this product as opposed to all the other digital routers is that with the pioneer, I can control everything from the driver seat without too many remotes that my 2 years old don't know what to do with. I can simply check what each of the other output is getting on my front mirror monitor and keep everyone happy.WE LOVE IT."
3,Good service,"I sent this item as a gift. It was received in a timely manner, and I have heard no complaints about its condition. Unfortunately, I cannot say more at this time, since the gift will not be opened until later."
4,"meditative, concise,scholarly",A book that summarizes the essential themes of John's Gospeland offers thoughts that help relate the Word of God to daily life.Its concise style shows Brown's scholarship and his fidelity tothe truths that John's Gospel offer to the searching reader.
2,Great band. Lousy recording.,"There isn't much out there from the great X-Pensive Winos so it's worth a look, but the video and sound quality are awful. A good cell phone could do as well. A better title from the same tour is ""Live in Boston"" which is an import from Argentina and can usually be found on eBay and occasionally on Amazon. It's not exactly HD, but it sounds fine and the camerawork and editing are excellent. The band interaction really comes across and they were on fire that night. Between the first couple of songs, KR says ""We're the Winos. it's Saturday night and we're here to rock"". They delivered."
4,what did he say,"He plays a killer guitar, but can't understand what he says. Maybe that's why I ordered it. Thanks!!! Came in just like I thought."
5,I have it for breakfast,"An easy to read and inspiring book. I keep it on the breakfast bar because dipping into it is the best way to start the day! A wise,gritty approach to life which shows how you really can make the most of it and you."
5,The best oatmeal ever,"This is a wonderful product. Like one of the other commenters I've tried every brand of oatmeal on the market & this is simply the best. Really, it's so good that all it needs is the tiniest amount of sweetener & it cooks up quickly & evenly as well. Love this stuff. It's available at some Stop & Shop markets in Massachusetts. Will definately be buying more of this!"
2,wrong item,"The product that I ordered was the wrong item. When I called to find out how to return it, the person on the phone was really great, said to keep the item as a gift and refunded my money promptly. We then took all of the boxes of oatmeal to a church who feed the needy. As far as the shipping, it was wonderful and the people on the phone were GREAT."
1,Scattered notes don't make a coherent book,"This is mostly bare system reports without a word of explanation. What text there is is incoherent or just notes thrown in without plan. The systems are simple and are a step further towards your own designs but as it is, this should not have been published as a book and doesn't rate against what else is available."
2,"Interesting information, but sparse detailed explainations.","I was disappointed in the book's lack of explaining the various systems. I am currently using one of these systems, but it took a good deal of work on my part to extract it from the book and program it into my own application program. The book's language is so cryptic, incomplete, and filled with distracting titles of the algorithms; that unless you spend the time to decipher the hardcopies of the computer application program (which is almost essential to own in order to get utility out of the book) you may be disappointed in the book. It requires a good deal of effort and patience on your part to get useful results from the book. With all that said, I am still interested in his other book and will probably order it."
1,Not even used,I heard this guy speak in a TradeStation event. I didn't think he was the best presenter but he had a few interesting things to say. Based on that I thought I'd see what he could do in writing. I should have paid attention to the more mixed reviews. I bought the book for $3.00 used. $3.00 shipping. It wasn't worth the time or money even at that price.
4,Great book for the beginner,"The Trading Systems Toolkit is a quick read book for the beginning futures trader. The emphasis on system trading and the need for strict adherence to the system is what the beginner needs for the first experience in the markets. Mr Krutsinger does a good job of specifying the key points of a good system, gives multiple examples of each, and discusses how to generate more ideas. This book should be a welcome addition to any traders library."
5,"If you can't take the course, read this book","I took the course but then I bought this book for reference, it contains all material covered in the actual course and more."
3,Good one but can be far better...,"Good one for starters..but only good...not the best. Could have been better with lab examples and their 'corresponding' screens rather than defining a setup, and displaying the screen of some other configuration. Some errors and confusion, especially when specifying commands in the Global or Interface config mode."
3,Good Book,Good foundation for studying for the CCNA. Read this and study Lamalle's CCNA and you should pass the test. Lamalle's book is a must to pass the test
2,"Overall decent, but missing some key info.","Hello...where is the section on LAN switches/brides/hubs? Not in this book. ISDN is also a bit too brief. I just passed the CCNA exam and there is an entire section titled ""LAN switching"". This book is great for understanding IP addressing (which I had a total of about 3 q's) , access lists/network security and is huge for the OSI model. Do not rely on this book alone to pass the exam. Take a class for hands on routing, buy this book and Todd Lammle's Study Guide, (not the big fat book), and you will pass no problem."
3,"pretty good but has too many errors, doesnt cover ISDN!",I took the ICRC class and bought this book to study for the CCNA book. The book maps pretty well to the ICRC class but it has a lot of errors in it and it does not cover the ISDN details. But the coverage of IP addressing and subnetting is awesome. Get this book and the Lammle CCNA book for the CCNA test.
5,Great Book,"Just scored 91% on CCNA exam using this book and Lammle's CCNA study guide. Both books are good, but this book is so well written and has so much extra info that I'm sure I'll be using it as a reference book in the future."
4,Well organized book,"AFTER READING THIS ICRC BOOK, I WAS CERTIFIED AS CCNA WITH 90% AND WOULD LIKE TO APPRECIATE THE WAY THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN AND EXPLAINED.IT IS SYSTEMETIC AND WELL ORGANIZED AND ALSO IS A GOOD SOURCE FOR THE PROFESSIONALS NEW TO CISCO ROUTERS"
1,DO NOT USE THIS TO STUDY FOR THE CCNA!,"This was a horrible book considering its main purpose, as implied by the title, is to prepare you for the CCNA...I used 3 sources to study for my CCNA, 2 if you exclude this one...which you should. Use Lammle's book from SYBEX..MUCH better, no matter what level of experience...along w/ possibly the Exam Cram."
2,Just an introduction...,"I'm rather newbie in the Cisco router world so I tried to find a book to help me get up and running my new Cisco 803 ISDN router. While I did find some helpful informations about boot processes and basic configuration theory, I am rather decieved of this book because every subjet is only treated superficially. Besides examples given are taken from IOS 11, not being up to date anymore within the last version 12.0. There are no basic command references at all, which makes the use of this single book for practical configuration purposes insufficient. (And if you try to get more help on the cisco website you're drown in a huge amount of poorly organised technical infos!) Also ISDN is not treated at all in this book. It maybe a introduction book to internetworking, indeed the first 4 chapters deal with this topic. Only starting from chapter 5, the introduction to basic router configuration really begins, unfortunately nothing more in substance..."
4,"Excellent for the exam, Excellent as a review.","This book starts at the beginning of what a new networking engineer needs to know and works through several examples of how this works in the real world today. It covers TCP/IP, AppleTalk, IPX, X25, Frame Relay, and more, if you count the appendicies. Unsurprisingly, it's also the best study guide for the CCNA. The writing is vague in places, but on the whole a review of the state of technology this clear is remarkable."
5,Great Book ! Great Author,"This book is really helpful if you're just starting out in Respiratory Therapy, the illusrations are great. The book is easy to read and understand. Great reference book. There are charts and quick references you can either cut out of the book or photo copy and have as a handy pocket guide."
3,Nice introduction,"The explanations and details have been simplified for easy digestion in an intro course. My anatomy text contained many many more details in the overlapping chapters. The online course materials are quite lacking. The accompanying CDROM is mostly useless. If the book is required in your respiratory care curriculum, that would not be a bad thing. It works."
2,How does this fit in the learning process?,"I bought this with the ""Just Listen'N Learn"" (the beginners level), hoping that it will help me continue the learning process. The first part is not the greatest, but it is a decent introduction (VERY light on grammar, but O'K on useful vocabulary and phrases). The ""Plus"" though is just plainly hard to use. The is a huge gap between ""JLNL"" and ""JLNL Plus."" It may be O'K for someone who already knows Spanish on an intermediate level, but you have to brace yourself for some hurdles:- again, grammar is reduced to minimum,- structures, tenses, etc. are used without an explanation,- a lot of words and phases are never translated,- dialogues get really boring.Overall, just (barely) O'K to enhance skills, but you will need to rely very heavily on other sources to get through it."
5,Great Resource,"This was the only advanced Spanish-learning ""system"" that I could find at the library. Anyway, I brought it home and it was terrific. It is certainly challenging, but it will improve your Spanish quickly. The speakers speak at a rapid pace and use natural-sounding dialogue (they don't use textbook pronunciations--they slur certain sounds together, chop off ends of words, etc), which helps to train your ear and understand native speakers better. In addition to the listening exercises, there are writing and speaking exercises. Overall it is an excellent product."
5,"Beautiful, but too short","Frontier House was my fav show this year and I was excited to get the music for it. The songs are rather short and it wasn't long enough in my opinion. However, the songs themselves are beautiful, with a slight country twang and some wonderful violin accompaniment. A perfect match to the show and its surroundings. I find myself listening to it over and over again."
4,Companion to the DVD,I enjoy this CD. It wasn't exactly what I had expected when I bought it but I came to enjoy it over time and now it's one of my favorites and about ready to be replaced.I had thought it might have more of the songs that were played at the fair and the wedding (in the show) but as it turns out it is the background music to the series - which is wonderful and at times haunting. There is alot of violin and guitar on this CD.If you enjoyed the series and like soundtrack music you will probably appreciate this.
5,Blessed Vows,"In all the books in this series you feel like your in Montana, in the snow storms, in the action.I love how Rachel is a really nice person, someone who is genuine. Jake never expected to findsuch a woman as Rachel. She's good with kids, knows how to cook, but yet has a spunky personality.Divine Appointment, their meet was. But Jake is a guy and didn't realize...so...lol, dundundunnnn, then what?You have to read to find out, what happened next."
3,"Not her Best, But Not her Worst","I'm at a crossroads with this one. Rachel, which the author used in the previous book, HEAVEN'S TOUCH, was very set on marriage and finding ""The One"". This book compliments the theory that so many women rush into romance and marriage. Rachel falls head over heels in love with Jake, her brother's best friend. But Jake doesn't believe in true love, which Rachel does not know. Jake recieves Sally, his deceased sister's daughter, who is very clingy to her uncle. On one encounter with Rachel and Sally in Rachel's family diner kitchen where he discovers Rachel would be the perfect companion for Sally. Jake romances her and proposes, which with her hopeless romantic spirit, agrees. But Jake's romancing ways change when they get to their new home and Jake has his stuff in a different room.Interesting book, no balance. I felt the ending was way too rushed and that problems solved in a few pages are not very strong. I give this book 3 stars."
4,"Useful, easy read","Very enjoyable reading. I learned much from Matt's odyssey through the poker world. I was particularly intrigued by Matt's analysis of expected value for particular situations. I recommend the book, particularly to players that have caught the poker ""bug"" in the last 3 years."
1,Worst poker book known to mankind,"I was going to throw this piece of trash away about a third of the way through, but then I decided if I was going to write a review, ethically I had to read the whole thing. Tortuously I ploughed through it to the bitter end. Now I've come to where I can finally write the damned review, and I realize it isn't worth a review.So I'm simply going to say this is the worst poker book I have ever read. More than that, it may be the worst book I have ever read. None of you may like this non-review, and I really can't blame you. But I can state with assurance, you won't be able to say I didn't warn you."
4,A look into riding 50 years ago,"I liked it because of the pictures and interveiws from the 60's. It was before the ""Biker Lifestyle"" was known beyond people that actually rode motorcycles, and before it became mainstream and acceptable as it is now. You can see they were working class Guys that were tough, but not sinister or criminals. Unlike the guys in the 1% clubs today ivolved in shady activities and the upscale guys dressing up on the weekends pretending to be bikers. Even the Author noted the end of the old Chicago Outlaws that he rode with. These Guys were motorcycle riders and were involved with racing, traveling, and partying with each other no matter what the club colors were. You could tell they liked Harleys but rode all brands. The Harley Sportster was popular because of it's performance. Now and since the 1980's it's labeled as a girls bike because of it's smaller size and lighter weight compared to the big twins."
4,The Bikeriders,"Purchased this book due to its significance in the history of photography. The addition of the color images was a nice touch, if you don't have the original version i would recommend this book as an alternative."
3,The Bikeridiers,"This book was very interesting and gave in-site into motorcycle riding, and riders of years past. I found it a little bit hard to read. this is written in the sixties with all the lingo of the day. Through all this I feel any motorcycle enthusiast will enjoy the reading. I also enjoyed all the pictures. They show the styles of the era and the way people customized their bikes."
5,"Good Night, Good Knight, Good Book","Delightful beginning reader that is also a delight as a bedtime, good night book. It centers around the efforts of a knight to help three little dragons get to sleep with the usual glasses of water, bedtime stories and a lullaby. Repetition in words, actions and illustrations both facilitate its function as an early reader and as a sleep inducer. Vocabulary like, crumbly tumbly tower, clippety-clop make it fun and the juxtaposition of the very loud roars the knight hears and the little dragons with their jammies on and their inocent requests are delicious. The story may remind readers of ""The Wolf's Chicken Stew."""
4,Puffin,"I have had two traditions all these years for my children, my grandchildren, and now my great grandchildren and that they are (1)to get a Christmas ornament for that year and (2)a book for a Christmas present along with other presents. I got this book for my great grandson. I am sure his parents read this to him but I don't know how he liked it. I thought it was a sweet book for a young child."
1,A reason to be deaf,"These guys are about as musical as Brittany Spears. They were playing in my town and I bought this to prime myself for their much-hyped show. Needless to say, I steered clear of the show, and was reminded of that great P.E. adadge -- Don't Believe the Hype!"
1,Celtic Schmeltic,"Unlistenable! Possibly the worst vocalist I have EVER heard. 10 tracks of train wreck. By far, this is the WORST CD I had bought in the last 5 years. There is NOTHING Celtic OR musical about this band. P.S. Who writes their lyrics? Ronnie James Dio?"
2,Not What Expected!,"I received my order today (1/5/12), one day after it was mailed (?) Wasn't expecting so soon since it took 7 days to ship after ordering (12/28/11). Anyway, the book did not come as described. The condition read as ""Used - Like New"". It is in good condition, but not LIKE NEW. There is underling, cover is curled up, slight liquid damage to pages near the back, and food crumbs between some pages. I only buy a certain type of books. If you were honest about you description, I would have past on this deal even if the price was $5.00. I don't like markings in my books."
3,good,I teach yoga and am always looking for new music. This cd is good and workable but not quite long enough for my class needs.
2,disappointing,I bought this for my yoga stretch class. The music is both weird and annoying. not what i expect from a yogafit cd. Was a total waste of my money.
4,Poignant and compelling,"This is a poignant, compelling story that those of us who are baby-boomers will soon experience ourselves, if we haven't already. Mr. Shine bears all - his personal pain, frustrations and annoyances - dealing with the inevitable death of his father and realizing the experience is bringing him close to his brothers once again and the past they share. He indicts the medical community that, he felt, treated his father as a temporary occupant of a hospital bed. Like impatient FAA air traffic controllers, nurses and doctors were unwilling to be inconvenienced by adult children who were reluctant to let the scheduled departure take off on time. A quick and fulfilling read."
2,inconsequential,"This book didn't manage to make me feel anything. I simply couldn't get myself to sympathise with the heroine. Sure, she is just a kid, lost in life, looking for honest human relationships and struggeling with the superficiality and indifference of the world around her, but at the same time a lot of her misery seems rather self-inflicted. Even if this might make me sound ultra-conservative, it's not like she lacks the means to make other choices and no circumstances force her to spend her life between clubs, drugs and designer clothes.As for the shock value (a cynical teenager taking drugs, drinking and having random sex with everybody in sight) it is all a little too constructed to be truely shocking and there are other books about similar issues (American Psycho) that do a much better job in getting to you."
1,A Disappointment,"This was a huge disappointment. The Advertisment says it is solid gold, it is hollow.The gold also wasn't gold, it seemed more copper colored, and it didn't clean up well. I returned this before I even got it home."
5,SQL Server 6.5 Admin Guide- Value for money!,This book is an excellent start to learning how to use SQL Server v6.5. It gives an overview of the features that the SQL Administrator would need to know for handling day-to-day tasks and problems with it.I thoroughly recommend this book. Well worth the money! Easy to understand for both beginners and advanced users.
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. He didn't break down the strumming pattern or the picking techniques. He goes through the each chord used which is great, but when there were no other instructions after that - just video showing him playing. Perhaps the dvd is not geared towards beginners who require a little more information than just the chords used for a song."
3,Sobre este DVD,"Es un dvd que trae la tablaturas, pero las explicaciones son muy rapidas y debes de estar regresando a ciertos riffs para que te resulte facil poder tocar la cancion, creo que la combinacion de las canciones no es 100 % en el mismo genero ya que mescalan Slaughter con Goo goo Dolls"
4,Effective but sticky,"This sunscreen was recommended by my aesthetician. It's too sticky for my taste, but it works and it doesn't irritate my skin. I warm it up with the fingertips before applying to minimize the stickiness. A little goes a long way, it really lasts forever."
4,as good as the previous volumes`,"Kerr has a good series going here. While I always seem to compare stories to my two personal favorite authors, Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan, this series has definitely landed a close third on my list behind Goodkind. I enjoy Celtic storylines and her characters do come to life well. It can slow down at times, but I am half way through and enjoy it. A book that I look forward to reading when I get home is a rare thing for me to find now days, and this series has supplied me with several."
1,Mine was a waste of $180,I received it opened it got the CD out Place it in my PC and it looked as if it would work and you go into a subfolder of this CD and boom it's corrupt it Lags up your Computer and you have to eject it to stop it from behaving the way it was. I need this CD Now and It look's like coby dosen't care about this failure of a product or any of it's products at all. but the hardware was all good it ran great it's just that i formated it because it was acting funny i have to have this CD a -clean copy- so i can use it to recover this PMP a message pops up for the recovery CD and to connect it to the PC to reinstall the required files from this CD. :(
1,Too Bad........,"....Coby does not support this player anymore..Consistant lock ups and non sync vid audio....Used the stylus over 3 times in 10 mins to anti freeze this device.The only thing good about it was the detachable battery..If coby had stuck to this product and improved the firmware,they would have ruled this market..Seems like they bit off the ""Apple"" Ipod and built in battery disposables continues..."
1,Avoid this device if you have Windows Vista.,"If you have Windows Vista, avoid this product because it will not work. Both the CD ROM and the instruction manual are not helpful, as they are not based on a Vista operating system. This past Monday (2/22/10) I tried contacting Coby via e-mail to troubleshoot my issues with using this thing, and so far almost three days have passed and no response. It turned into e-mail hell with the seller I bought this from while they were trying to provide troubleshooting instructions, but the recommendations the seller made were based on the instruction manual (as I already said, the instruction manual does not help if you have Windows Vista). If you have Vista, save your money and look for another media player.If something magically happens and it starts working with Vista, I'll update my review and my 1 star rating."
1,Slanted History,"John K. Alexander's book is a waste. First of all, it isobvious that this guy has a personal agenda to slander and discredit the founders and framers of the Constitution and Country. He takes facts--which are poorly researched--and twists them to support his thesis. But the most important reason I would not buy this book is because John Alexander seems to enjoy and revel in slavery...Buy another book on this matter."
4,JUST WHAT I WANTED !,THIS ACTUALLY LOOKED BETTER EVEN IN PERSON. DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL STANDING MIRRORS. UNUSUALAND PRETTY FOR ANY ROOM IN THE HOUSE.
5,Very good product,"This is one of those products that you use and then think, where has this been all my life! Adds a great flavor to soups, gravies and other chicken dishes. I would leave out the salt to dishes I plan on adding this too."
5,Works Great - Cannot Find It,"I have been taking Axid AR for about 16 years, and it works great for reducing acid reflux problems. It was originally prescribed by a doctor for me.The last place that I could buy it was at Wal-Mart. They don't have it any more. Now I see there is nobody on-line either. What happened?I would buy more if it were available (at a decent price)."
2,Computerized flash cards,"I have mixed feelings about this product. It's a computerized flash card system which is fine. I question though, the value of the words they incorporated and ask me to learn. Do I really need to learn the French word for bumble bee? Giraffe? I feel more thought should have gone into selecting the words to learn to make this more practical."
1,Disappointing . . .,"I generally have had good experiences with Panasonic products so I thought I would be pleased with this fax machine. Instead, I had problems with both my original purchase AND its replacement.With both machines, I could not send any faxes! When I would insert a document, I would hear a beep confirming that it sensed that paper was in place for transmission. When I dialed a number and it came time for the fax to be sent, the motor would make a sound yet my paper would not go through. I tried assisting the paper through by gently pushing it but it still did not work. I repeatedly got a ""Paper Jammed"" message. I am returning my replacement to get a fax machine of a different brand!"
1,THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY BEFORE BUYING PANASONIC,I spent [...] on a Panasonic phone. The store I bought it from had a 3 month return policy... the problems with my phone started 3 months and 11 days after purchase. Panasonic are absolutely not there in support - their solution is to send the phone back to them for repair or they will send me a refurb (at my expense... thanks a lot). Meanwhile - my solution - BUY A NEW PHONE until they get around to returning mine to me! Great! Thanks! Never again....
1,"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this machine!!!","I bought this machine 3 weeks ago and it worked fine. A few days ago, I started getting ALOT of static on the line, and the channel changer had absolutely NO EFFECT. Now, there is so much static on the line from the cordless phone I can't even hear my conversations. I called their ""help"" number and they just told me to bring it in for service. What a joke. They didn't even try and see what's wrong. I guess they must get plenty of calls regarding this model. Save yourself the headache (and the money)and avoid this machine like the plague."
5,Walk through cold fire ROCKS!,"It is surprising to me that there is such a following for this book, I always thought I was the only one. How wrong I was! This book totally rocks! It is the ultimate teen drama and I wish that Cin would write more. Even though I first read it 13 years ago I have never stopped loving it. And I don't care that it is categorized as a ""juvenile"" book I think it applies to the teenager in all of us."
5,Wonderful book!,"Like most everyone listed here, I read this book as a teenager and loved it! I have been looking for it for years and only remembered the title, but not the author.Read the book!"
1,Criminally Bad,"This is one of those songs, like TLC's new song, that is about as simplistic as you can get. What is the message in this song? Smile, and your life will drastically improve? That's such a childish way to think, and it would be better if she actually tackled a real issue instead of trying to be so chipper. The rapper doesn't help matters; she is annoying, and her little cute a$$ statements make the song even more syrupy. Do not buy this, unless you have no idea what good music is."
5,JENNIFER LOPEZ MOVE ASIDE/ VC IS DA BOMBBBBB!,"SMILE IS JUST THE BEGINNING -- WAIT TILL YOU HERE THE REST OF THE ALBUM. VC RULES!!!!!!!!! Finally, A female band that sings from the HEART and has something to say that makes a difference. Buy the album, listen to the music, feel the energy and the power of a real person and not just an overhyped superstar that couldn't care less about the music and the people listening to it."
5,Great Pop Song,This is simply a great pop song - people should stop over analyzing and leave it at that!
5,It's a great song that never gets old!,Vitamin c is a cool band and woowee! that girl is hot!I'd recomend it for people who just like to have fun.
5,cool blend of ska and pop,"wow! i think this is a pretty cool single. I got it on a sampler and it's awesome! vitamin c(what IS her real name??) mixes all of the types of music I listen to:ska,pop,and a little bit of alternative rock. i am definately gonna be the first one to buy the full cd when it comes out."
1,Woman trapped in a kiddy pop song's body,Vitamin C sounds just like an 18 year pop star but she looks and acts like a 30 year old woman Hmmmmm. Put a smile on your face Diane Arbus. Get a real musical life Vitamin C and don't torture us with your lame candy ass pop.
1,Yuck,"Cool hair color, bad song. Vitamin C should be lip syncing to Britanny not making records. Save your money."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE/DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE/DON'T BELIEVE,"This record sucks! I sold mine. Phili music fan must be Vitamin C's mother, boyfriend or someone from the record company. Avoid this music at all costs. Get Christine Aguilera or Limp Biskit instead, You'll be much happier."
1,"NO, it can't be","Someone actually beat out b'witched for worst new artist of the year?Yes i think we have a winner,Vitamin C needs a dose of Vitamin T... TALENT!!!!"
2,It was a tad disappointing,"I think that Vitamin C is an ok band. ""Smile"" was not a good song at all. All they did was keep repeating smile over and over. Personally I like Limp Bizkit ""Nookie"" better."
4,"Okay, so what's the point?","I played drums on Over The Garden Wall's version of Firth Of Fifth. I agree that there is no point in releasing a CD of cover songs that are pretty much identical to the original, but let me explain. We were a bonafide Genesis Tribute Band! We prided ourselves on our ability to entertain people and make them feel that they were actually seeing and hearing the Genesis from the past. When we were asked to contribute to this CD, we literally had to record and mix the song in ONE day with 2 or 3 takes, and NO click track. We did not have any time to work out a clever arrangement or approach. Looking back on it now, we probably should have just said, ""Why bother?"" but we figured that this CD would help us get more gigs.Our version sort of combined the studio release with the live Genesis version."
1,Let's have a serious coversation,"Would you buy a tribute to Elvis or the Beatles or Dylan or The Stones or Yes or Bowie or Stevie Ray or Prince or Pink Floyd... or whatever if you could listen to the ""original stuff @ it's finest""???? I think not. And this is an example of that. Nothing but the original. Now, if in 100 years it gets played ""live"" like Mozart or Beethoven; well, that would be another story, wouldn't it be????"
2,Fan's #1 Request - Don't Screw it Up,"There are songs that should never be re-interpreted or covered, and if released as a tribute, should not shame the original work.I was in several bands, I'm no stranger to criticism, so I'm just going to be blunt. The Carpet Crawlers is one of the most beautiful songs sung by Peter Gabriel, and it is not a challenge to be taken lightly. The singer on this tribute is not soulful, morose, soft and lovely, but is instead whiny and in no way soothing. More importantly, they somehow turned it into a whiny soft-rock song with soprano - I booooo you. I mean, wow. I appreciate that the singers are not English, and maybe there are cultural differences, but once I heard the strings kick in, that was it. Fail. Epic. Irredeemable.I condemn this cover, equate it with the ET video game of the 1980's, and wash my hands of it."
1,Stinks,"I love all the classic 70's Genesis albums. The problem with a tribute album to a progressive rock band like Genesis is that the original tracks were so detailed and complex. This leaves little room for interpretation for any musicians who would wish to put a new slant on things. The late Kevin Gilbert does some interesting things with ""Back in NYC"", and Robert Berry's revved-up, metallic version of ""Watcher of the Skies"" is fairly exciting; otherwise I find little to recommend here. Many of these songs are done by obscure artists who end up sounding like second rate Genesis cover bands."
4,Returning to their Roots,"It is about time this group returned to the music they are most familiar with and grew up with in the South. The vocal harmonies are still great, although I miss Toubo who passed away some years ago. Perhaps he was an inspiration to them as was one of their NJ fans,Vera. She had long suggested they do a gospel CD. Glad to see Joe took her idea and used to the group's advantage. With the proper marketing this should do well for them. Let's hope the warm, rich harmonies will help get gospel music back to some measure of what it use to be ""Go Tell- The Good News. Bless you guys, your maturity is finally showing. Sweet Joe from the wilds of North Carolina."
5,"Long time Fan, Thanks B. T.",Love the Persausions totally. Always admired this great acappella group. Wish I could sing with them.
5,Enter The Cone Zone,"This book is GREAT! It was all I expected and better. I laughed out loud alot, and the pictures, although in black and white, are hysterical! A great touch is the pictures of Conan and Andy's reactions. This book is a great buy!What are you waiting for? Go buy it!"
5,What a great great book... FOR ME TOO POOP ON!,"Conan O'Brien's brilliant writers, Andy and himself put together this original work a couple years ago and it makes me laugh every time I grace my eyes with its bible-like paper (although the pictures, which are in black in white, would look better if they had been left in their original colour glory)."
5,attention grabbing,"I have enjoyed reading many of Hansen's books, and this was a fun one to read. I feel that I can really get involved in the story lines and characters. This is a love story, but also full of drama. There was just enough of both to keep your attention and finish it quickly. After I finished it I was looking for another one of her books that I hadn't read yet."
1,religous book,"disapointed - I was looking for a suspence novel and found a type of ""jesus loves you"" ""christman miracle"" story, with superfitial characters and predictible plot lines, cottoned with ""praise the lord"" moments. hated it."
4,It is definitely worth owning.,"I would definitely recommend this album. While I don't really care for the remixes of ""Tremble"", ""Omnibus"", or ""Catch"", I would say that the majority of these tracks are worth having. DJ Geoffe did an excellent job mixing this album--I like his usage of the phasing/flanging effects. While some of them may be considered ""cheese trance"", I really don't see the point of elitist ""progressive"" trancers who scoff at the uplifting/hard trance genre. Let the people listen to whatever they feel like. I also enjoy many types of rock music, which always use the same basic instrumentation. I don't complain that they ""just find new ways to use the same things over and over"". There are only so many synthesizer settings in the world, you know. If you have a problem with this style, don't listen to it. But don't criticize other people for their tastes. That being said, I will step off the soapbox and suggest that you give this album a second look."
4,Very Good CD,"If you've never heard Trance before, then you need to get this CD. It's not the best in the world, but it's a fabulous collection of really great, classic stuff. Buy it!"
1,Not worth it,"This guide is NOT worth the money. The information contained in it is very intresting, but not at all useful for improving your game. It is more of an advertisement for the cars in the game than anything else. All of the information contained in the book is in the game itself. For example, car weights, horsepower, and cost. I am very disapointed in the ""game value"" of the guide.There are course by course giudes to help you learn each track, but the information is not all that great. The book will for example say that turn 4 is a 75% throttle turn for most cars.There is, however, one good piece of advice in the book. They tell you that the key to a fast lap time is racing your ghost. This is what I have done since the original GT and I have found it to be the best way to improve. A level 4 turbo will not increase your lap times unless you can keep the car on the track.Forget the guide, save your $ to pay for part of another game instead."
4,be a better race driver,"This book is a must have for anyone new to Gran Turismo, for al those who played any of its predecessor this is a chance to learn about the new cars and tracks. The book gives you information about the tracks, how to take the corners, car tuning tips and most important the car settings. By Reading the book you will become a better player, even the most experienced gran turimothusiassed will learn a trick or two."
3,Good Racing game,"I was very happy to have bought this game, the one problem is that you start out with 18,000 dollars; the game developers shold have made it either 20,000 or 22,000.The tracks get some getting use to, what is also cool is the music that plays while your driving. To get the license, there are about six diferent ones, certain races require you to have a certain license. Some of them are very hard to get, mainly the time that you have to complete it in, which I find a bit unreal.If you have gameshark you get get the code to have all the license.Overall it's a fun game to play, but after awhile you get a bit bored playing it."
3,yankee swap,"In this book, Lisa's friend Merrill comes to ride at Pine Hollow. She is a good rider but lacks confidence. When she does well on one school horse, she decides to buy him. The Saddle Club launches a scheme to keep the horse and prove to Merrill that she can ride anyone well she chooses.Personally, I thought the Club members should have been more realistic. It wasn't like any of them rode Barq anymore, so why not let him go home with Merrill? That seemed a little selfish as well as unrealistic."
4,Teaching Math and Reaching Students,"This book is perfect for any teacher that wants to teach children math, so that they will learn with understanding. This book examines the elements that are necessary in a classroom that teaches with understanding. This book also examines several different, diverse classrooms that serve as examples. This book is an excellent resource and will help any existing or pre-service teacher better understand mathematics and how to teach mathematics within the classroom."
5,"Excellent, comprehensive source of CBT techniques",This is a very useful tool for helping depressed individuals by using cognitive-behavioral techniques. A number of forms that can be used in treatment are included. Common cognitive distortions and treatment strategies are clearly described.
2,Who want's this? NOT ME!,"The local Best Buy has a ton of copies of this album in stock. That must mean it's going to be flavor? Naah, probably just means they are popular and gets tons of airplay. Oddly enough, it's none of the above. I still have no idea who these kids are, which one is which any ways? I know by the album cover that one is Asian, I'm not into stereo-typing, and I don't know who is who, they both are avarage, and that's not good. It's a shame he is repping for the Asians, Key Kool, Mountian Bros & even Jin do a much better job. This album isn't complete trash, but it has nothing that stands out. And it has nothing that compel music fans to buy it. Even the ones with Master P standards. They could improve with time, but something tells me that time won't be too friendly to them, and this is going to be their one moment.The first single is ""Who Want's This""Never ask a question you don't want the answer too. Because most people won't want this."
3,It's About Time Somebody Remember What Rap Is....,"Although some of the other reviewers didn't like this album, it's become one of my favs. For those that weren't around 15 years ago, this album is really close to what rap was then, and what it should be now. Lyrics are what makes the rapper....not how ""gangster"" they are. These kids are flowin on the mic, and not a whole bunch of ""... 'em up"".....other rappers need to listen!!!"
3,Letdown...,"Actullie the beats are on album are pretty tight and there's three good song ""lets roll"" , "" who wants this"" , and , ""tell me"" which was the reason i bought it but fo real, the rest of the album with weack songs like ""its on"" , ""lets get naked"" , ""gully"", and all the other tracks? Realy dissapointed me coz i thought diz would be a good album and its not good its ight counting the tight beats and three good songs the rest is just plain boring and the lirycs gets to be realy mediocre and corny... Naw, i don't recommend smilez & southstar's "" crash the Party"" coz it ain't realy worth nuthing."
1,What? Are you deaf??,"Ok, anyone who thinks this rappin is tight is straight up wacked. In their song Tell me, they rAp about ""chillen in tha hood."" That's when contradicting comes in...I thought they were from the south. Like I was saying, I think personally that THEY ARE TRYING TOO HARD. I give them 1 *star* just because the following reasons. 1)they're new 2)they got OK rymes 3)they dont like fully [stink]. Bur trust, they are not the hot bots on da streets. KYHU. (keep ya head up)"
1,A God awful CD,"How can I possibly put into words how bad this CD is? There are a few decent hooks on this CD, but over all, a big enthusiastic two thumbs DOWN![.] They DO have good energy (to give them some credit), but their lyrics leave much to be desired. It's the same thing over and over and over. I mean, ""Your friends were my friends, my friends were your friends, your dough was my dough, my dough is my dough, mano y mano"", come on, give me a break. That mano y mano part doesn't have anything to do with ANYTHING. Here's a tip to all you guys out there. Don't waste your money. This is a LAME CD![.]"
4,Orlando!!!!! Great Album from these O-Town Rappers!!!!!!!!!!,"Smilez and Southstar definitely deserve props for making this album. Almost all of the joints on here are tight. I felt that there could have been less skits and a few more songs, though. My favourites are: It's Gully, Tell Me, and Now That You Are Gone, which is touching becuz I just lost a member of the family. Smilez and Southstar are fo sho gonna have another tight a** album comin out, so quit hatin."
3,these guys aren't worth it....,"alright, all the people talking about how good these guys are, what do you usually listen to? These guys aren't hip hop, straight up...Nor can they stay around the rap game very long unless they improve quickly...However, I do have to give them a 3 and not far lower, because, and I'm embarassed to say it, the song ""Tell Me"" is tight as hell. I heard it at a friend's place and had to go and download it when I got home...With how much I liked that song, I figured I'd check out the rest and that there'd be more good songs, I was extremely disappointed to say the least, the rest of the songs are weak, almost laughable...I got much love that one's an Asian, but he's not going to help improve the image of Asian rappers, that has to be left to Jin and the Mountain Brothers."
2,(Bad),"There are a couple of songs that are decent, and one really good song (Tell Me). The album is fairly (bad) though as a whole. The beats are not anything special, and the lyrics are seriously lacking in depth, meaning, and effect. This is just, pretty much, wanna-be gangster rap ... I would say download the one song and forget about these Orlando guys because you will never hear from them again."
3,1 hit wonder?,"like most albums, these cats have a few tight cuts. instruments play a key role in making ""tell me"" and ""now that you're gone"" pretty sweet. except for these two songs, the cd's a hot boyz rip. ""tell me"" is worth buying the album for."
1,im not a hater i just buck alot!,this cd is straight garbage...obviously you dont listen to real rap if you listen to this trash. these cats are too soft and they try to look hard. i swear to god let these idiots roll thru my hood they gon' wish they had some stuff to smile about! but on the real what happened to rap?! where did all the ill mc's go? oh yeah i forgot HEAVEN! nah just playin but once jay goes its all over cuz nobody else is gonna take the throne. but all i gotta say is this...this cd rite here is the reason why most hip hop is straight garbage! these dudes give rap a bad name!
2,this puts me to sleep,this does'nt interest me at all these guys are weak and they should quit save your money.
1,Bad,"This CD ..... Some of the beats are tight, like in ""Let's Get Naked,"" and ""It's On,"" but S & S can't rap, they messed up those songs with some stupid lyrics and bad hooks. Those songs are the only decent ones, the rest are garbage. Every damn lyric is basically about girls and ""clubbin."" Isn't their something else better to rap about?"
1,Horrible,worst thing ever made. there is no sugar on the peep. the chocolate is very thin and i dont think it is even chocolate its more like a watered down or imitation chocolate
1,I love these but.....,"I love these but for this price I assumed it was a pack of 5 or at least 4! No, it is for one piece of candy - total rip off! I understand that it is not sold by Amazon but they are letting it be fulfilled by Amazon and that should not be! Would never buy from this seller again just because of the rip-off factor!"
2,"Very Dissappointed, No Digital Readout, no rack mount kit.","I ordered this product thinking that it would come with the rack ears as shown in the pictures along with the digital read out. The model I received looks like it had been refurbished, didn't include the original packing, no documentation, ears, rails, etc and looked nothing like the pictures. Now I'm going to have to hunt down and purchase the ears / rack mounting supplies separate increasing the cost of this project. Very disappointed!"
1,Unreliable after a year,"I reviewed the scale upon first getting it & was pleased, however, now, a year later, the scale is unreliable. I would not recommend this scale."
5,Salter Electronic Bathroom Scale,"This scale is an excellent purchase. Weight measurement is very repeatable and appears accurate. It is helping me stay focused on my weight loss program. We used it to check travel luggage weight. Measurements were ""right on"" with airline check-in scales."
1,stinks - weak Jethro Tull ripoff - irritating vocals and so,"I had heard this was a good group, and bought this CD on a recommendation - it sucks and my copy will soon be in a used CD store. They might be good in a bar (if you're trashed) but they're a Jethro Tull ripoff (and a weak one at best). The songs on this CD are irritating and disjointed. Run away - don't buy this one - yeech. They wouldn't let me give this one 0 stars - so I gave it one."
1,PASS THE EARPLUGS PLEASE!,"Thank goodness that Amazon lets the public review music for the sake of saving others from this fate worse than death. Do yourself a favor, if you want to hear GREAT Celtic rock, get a Wolfstone album, get a Brother album, get a Rock Salt and Nails album. DO NOT SUPPORT THESE IMPOSTERS!"
1,It went directly to the used CD store,"What people see in this band I do not know. I got this recording on the recommendation of a friend and am reconsidering our friendship. These guys are about as Celtic as Michael Bolton is funky. They have picked tunes from a traditional songbook and butchered them as most bands with no relationship to the source do. Unauthentic, uninspiring, unlistenable, unceltic. Their label -- Magna Carta -- must need a tax write-off."
1,Celtic . . . really?,"Bob Miller's review is right on the money. If you want to hear great Celtic music, get a Brother album, get a Wolfstone album, get a Solas album. Do your research. Boycott these imposters! They only serve to dilute Celtic music and do the greatest of injustices to a great tradition."
4,Scare your neighbors with this one,"Wow, what a loud score! This is one of those black mass choir scores, on the lines of the Omen trilogy. However, this score is so much more evil and sinister, which is to its benefit. Nearly every track begins with some sort of a loud crash of instruments. The first track brings into mind a classic good vs evil struggle, while the sinister Leviathan track just eminates pure evil through its repetitive whooshing of a devil horn.(It sounds very dark and powerful) Some tracks are just as strange as they are spooky, for example the Hall of mirrors which features scary carnival music. This cd also features a few tracks from a lackluster 70's film. The music sounds a little flat, but the final track is pleasant. Over all, this cd is an excellent and scary ride. I reccomend this for fans of dark choirs or dark, scary music in general."
3,The Suspense of It All,"What happened? Will there be a ""threequel""? I am interested in finding out more about the new characters Miss Tilles introduced us to in this novel. The suspense of it all has me on pins and needles.Debra FuquaJackson MS Readers Club Rewiewer"
3,Sweet Revenge,I have read all of Jessica's books and I loved them all except this one. Alought it was a good book I wanted more and I think she was just adding in stuff and it didn't flow as well. I hope she don't push and make a third. Jessica is a great writer and I can not wait until the next book.Jessica good luck and keep up the writing.
5,David Lutton / Restauranteur,"Suite Talk is a great guide for everyone in the Service Industry.Dan's focus on the basics achieves the key results we all strivefor when servicing the public.I read the book, and smiled as I learned that using these simpleideas can improve my restuarant, and any poeple business that you may be involved in. Simple, honest, and realistic ideas drive this book, and make it a must read if you want to ""Wow your Guests"" in the future. Thanks Dan!"
1,Got a problem with the reviews,"As an industry professional, I was hopeful for a book that would give me new insight - enlighten, or recharge my batteries on the way I do and look at the hospitality business. I read all the reviews before I purchased this book and was extremely disappointed. Let's just say, my expectations plummeted after reading the book (which was very difficult to do). It is a rare day that I have to force myself to finish a book, but this one was tough due to the lackluster writing style, lack of thought provoking material, and lack of unique concepts. Someone actually called this book a Masterpiece? Okay. I will call it a Vanity Piece because I think that's exactly why it was written."
5,Suite Talk for the service industry,I found Dan's book to be quite readable and applicable to my company which happens to be a dental office with about 20 employees. The concepts are very simple yet powerful. It isn't a lot of academic mumbo jumbo- it is practical and easy to implement (from someone who has been there). Sometimes concepts become so complicated that they lose their power. Not so with Dan's ideas. I found it to be extremely valuable and readable. I have shared it with my partners and team members. Everyone at my office will read this book.
5,Suite Talk,This book is a MUST read for anyone in business. It is a quick and easy read that will leave you with simple and practical applications of customer service. Each story is entertaining and personal but most importantly leaves you with a relevant lesson to improve your business. Make sure you get a copy for every team member.
2,"Rob Thomas is great, but...","The sound quality of this disc is quite bad. Your money will be better spent on the new MB20 disc, or buy other new music, like 3rd Eye Blind's new one."
4,A must have!,"When I heard Rob Thomas was in a band before Matchbox Twenty I wanted it straight away. I went around every music shop I could find but no one had any Tabitha's Secret. Finally someone said try amazon and there it was. It only took about three weeks to come and I was so happy when it did. When I first heard it I was a little disapointed. Rob's amazing voice was still there but the backing music wasn't the same standard as mb20's. Now im much more used to it and love it to bits. My favourite songs are Paint me blue, High and Dear Joan. They have really interesting lyricks and Iwouldn't be without them."
2,Poor Sound Quality - Great Band,"Please don't waste your money on this cd unless you are collecting. The sound quality is so poor that it is completely distracting. In addition to that, that last thing I want to hear while listening to a song like ""Dear Joan"" is some drunk guys whooping and hollering like it was footbal game. The ONLY good point I can think of is that you get to hear Rob talk a little. But even that can't get me to recommend wasting money on this cd. It should never have been put out, its like buying a damaged product. Spend your money on any of the newer cd's, which are great, or try ""Don't Play with Matches""."
1,Great tunes But Nothing New,"If your purpose is to own all of Don Williams' CDs then buy this. If you are looking for new product, ""Silver Turns To Gold"" will not contain anything new. While the collection ""encompasses some of the songs that have a special meaning to Don Williams"" -- for the price of this rehash, I should have just passed."
5,Darn good product,"Product was very simple to install, plug and play. Instructions were perfect, directs you to web for most up to date lightscribe drivers. Roxio installed fine (on a Vaio), but didnt seem to run real well, but no matter because I had been running full Nero for some time. All features of this new double sided, lightscribe drive were available under it.Burns DVDs lightening fast (as compared to my old 2X), and the lightscribe is ""pretty darn cool"". Eliminates most needs to do labels! (I say most only because it takes much more time to burn the label than to burn DVD so may not want it on all...). I did not try double sided, but that was not what made me buy.Buy it! Or, wait until Lightscribe 1.2 hardware comes out (supposed to be better contrast on labels)."
1,DO NOT BUY - Read Below,"HEED MY WARNING!I bought this product and a few months later it started getting noisy, I have e mailed mad dog support several times and only get a response saying they will get back to me in 24-48 hours, its now been about 2 months and there is still no response. Their phone number leads nowhere... I started searching the web for information and found many very similar and even more alarming complaints than my own. Please, before you consider buying this read what people have written about their customer support... right now nobody even knows if the company still exists since NOBODY can get in touch with them. I urge you to google search MAD DOG SUPPORT and see the many different websites where many people have all too similar complaints."
1,Almost useless,"While filled with really good photos of the afv and tanks of WWII, the technical data is non-existant. The lack of useful armor ratings, muzzle velocities, and armor penetration values makes this book useless for anyone trying to get meaningful data. Good for kids and not much else."
1,Ick,"I didn't realize that this was a tiny book when I made the purchase. It fits into your pocket with room to spare. It does have some few interesting bits, but it wasn't worth the price I paid for it. If it sold on amazon for 1 cent maybe (with the shipping) it would be worth it."
3,A complete guide,"This book provides a complete guide to all tanks of World War II, drawing on information from the ultimate military authority, Jane's Information Group. There are also special sections on the development of the tank from the 1930's and on armoured tactics."
1,This song is boring,"This song is typical of boring and uncreative songs. This wanna be RnB/Dance Track cant make up its mind if its Aretha Franklin or Martha Wash, I would love to spin this record if Club 69 or Victor Calderone did a mix."
1,dissapointing,Britney meets Garbage with each aspect distracting from the other. No personality. Sorry
1,Buyer Beware; Amazon is selling opened units (missing parts),"I have a long history of ordering items from Amazon - and have always been more then happy. However, my most recent order arrived today and I am very disappointed. When did Amazon start selling - previously sold - items as new? The package I received had obviously been previously opened; The SD card is missing; The GPS unit was not secured inside the package; Other parts were freely scattered about; I assume there should be a manual; The CD package containing maps was opened (and came complete with smudged CDs). I could go on. I paid for a new item, paid extra for 2nd day shipping (so it would arrive in time for an upcoming trip)and instead got a totally unusable product."
1,Don't be a fool! WORST PRODUCT I'VE EVER BOUGHT!,"Had it 6 months now and it has crashed my palm 90% time I've used it! When it did work the routes didn't make any since. (routing through neighborhoods instead of freeways????). I have called TT support 11 times, talked to 3 supervisors and have received 3 promises of a replacement SD card with pre loaded Navigator. For 3 weeks I have not received anything (including 2 ""I'll call you back as soon as I get this straightened out"" from the Tech support Representative) Their Web and live support are a JOKE! On their support page, I've tried to search for a solution to the many problems I've had and halve the time I'd get re-directed to BUY more products! DON'T THINK IT WON'T HAPPEN TO YOU.....PLAY IT SMART/SAFE AND GET A DIFFERENT PRODUCT."
3,One big sticking point,This book is good. He gives you good ideas to futher chew upon and study. He gives great challenges to someone who thinks they are a good christian or close to God. My problem with this book is that it seemed like he had a chip on his shoulder...there was an incident where he gave a work of his art as a gift and the person rebuked him in a horrible manner. I agree it was awful how he was treated; but to use a book to trash an entire community or group of people because of that is poor taste.
5,This is a good book to read on the hawaiian history,"I found this little book rather sad to read on the hawaiian history,its well done the way the author puts his point across,so true and yet so very sad,if you are interested in the hawaiian history please read this."
3,Hit or miss,"My title sums this up. Once again we get a compilation with some of the greatest musicians ever assembled covering songs by one of the greatest bands ever. The results-in some instances brilliant, in some decent, and in some horrid. Mark Slaughter's glass-shattering scream at the start of Anthem covers the horrid pretty well. Portnoy's drumming covers the decent. Sure he is fast and can do weird times ok, but he misses the subtle nuances and panache that make Peart a legend. I actually prefer Castronovo's work on this one. Michael Romeo's godly ""how the heck did he do that?!"" lead guitar in Analog Kid covers the brilliant. If you enjoy the Shrapnel tribute cds, check this one out. If you are a stalwart Rush fan, you may want to steer clear."
1,"It's not Rush, and the whole idea Stinks","No one can capture the sound of Rush, except Rush. While the musicians here are certainly quite skillful to be able to even make an attempt at duplicating these complex tunes, duplications of music belong in only one place - the local nightclub. If they want to make good use of their musical talents, then please write something original."
3,prog heros combine,hey. i like rush but this is not as good as the real stuff. tribute cds usually bite. this is not bad. this and the helloween tribute are pretty good. if you like some of the people on the cd get it but if you are looking for another version of rush songs dont.
4,"Go ahead, buy it!","Not quite as good as the Subdivisions tribute, but I reccomend both. Whatever you do, don't buy the Red Star ""insult"" it's horrible!"
2,"Bad example of a ""tribute"" album!","Obviously the musicians playing on this album had nothing better to do than trying to duplicate Rush's songs. This is exactly how a tribute album should not be like, but it's the same problem with nearly any other album of this kind. O.K., the musicians are talented, so why didn't they try to bring some new interpretations? Plus, I have a very own problem with this record:I my opinion Rush were so successful and enjoyable, because they always added great pop melodies to their sound. But this tribute album offers a harder rocking sound, and Rush's fine songs are demoted to dull and cliched heavy rock tunes. This album may be of interest for hardcore Rush fans, for the rest of the world it's not worth a listen."
1,Blech,"It would appear that there are quite a few musicians out there who desperately need work. This album really isn't more than a showcase for Magna Carta, in hopes to attract new people to there line up of progressive bands or their numerous tribute CDs (it would appear that is all they can produce). As for the musicians and there musical prowess... Well, it is self-gratifying and over indulgent. It is one thing to show talent, it is another to do this. I'd call this project similar to physical self-gratification: nothing that benefits anyone other than the person doing it.Let me put a finer point on this. The musicians are not making a tribute to the band Rush so much as they are using another's creative output to further their own career.I grieve for anyone who buys this."
1,Pure Dirt,"Why would someone try to duplicate something pretty much the same way that it was done by the original artist? I think these guys are good enough to do their own music but this record was a complete waste of money. If your gonna pay tribute to Rush or any band for that matter, do it in an original way. This is not a good buy for a real Rush fan."
2,"Ain't nohtin' like the real thing, baby...","First, disclaimers: lifelong Rush fan here, although I have albums they've done I don't like much. But overall, I think Rush is the most distinctive and original band there is.That said, this stuff is only for people who want to hear someone else do Rush's music...if you really love Rush and what they do, stick to the Real Thing."
2,Could Have Done Better - anti Dream Theater,"Mike Portnoy and the rest or Dream Theater are just .... All they do (if you noticed) is try to cover RUSH. Go to a Music Downloading APP. such as Kazza(tm) and type 'Rush Cover'... at least 80% is Dream Theater. and they ... ne ways. Mike Portnoy Is not Neil Peart, and he'll never be. -SorryOverall the album was ok, except the over-usage of Mike P. and the horrid singer Mark Slaughter. ...if they plan on doing another album, they should try other artist like Tim Alexander Drummer of Primus and maybe Guitarist Greg Howe? ..."
1,This doesn't deserve ONE star!,"If you like all the bands that play on this tribute, have at it. If you're a real rush fan, go buy a gold edition CD or one of the live CDs, because this album is a SAD tribute to RUSH; it sucks...BAD. I am a long time RUSH fan, and I can tell you, these people should have never made a RUSH tribute album. They tried too hard and skipped all the difficult and complex pieces. It's like Rutsey decided to redo all the drum tracks that Neil so carefully crafted. The singing is incredibly horrible. Just listen to the audio clips! Just make sure you're near a toilet... This CD is AWFUL."
2,Not so close to the heart.,"Artists with floundering careers and overactive egos are not a fitting tribute to the magical chemistry of Rush. A band that has managed to stay intact(for the most part) deserves more than this. I would have been more impressed if this album was full of interpretive tracks. I give them an ""E"" for effort, but unfortunately this album fails to capture the point of Rush's approach to songwriting. Maybe an all piano album by Ben Folds would have been better... then again, maybe not."
2,Not Good at all!!,"I admit Mission sounds better than the original (The vocalist is wonderful) and La Villa kicks *&&*, there isn't many good tunes on this album."
4,a tribute woth buying this cd rock better than red star,"Frist off I love Rush most tributes are pertty bad and their a waste off time this tribute is better than most tributes cds this well thought out and frist this cd was ten years the cast has minor stars from the 80,s like jack russell from the great white and bach from skid row and major progrock bands from today like Fates Warning and james labrie from the band Dreamtheater I was hope bigger stars than this. but guessing by the list this from magana carta . steve morse an great choice jack russell verison OF ANALOG KID OK THE GOOD track 2 BYTOR AND SNOW DOG AND AND TRACK 5 LA VILL STARNGIATO AND YZZ TRACK 11 AND FATES warning version of closer to the heart and track12red barchetta .The bad THE trees track 4 Jacob,s ladder track 8 and natural science track 10 and track 13 freewill track 3. the analog kidanthem track 7."
1,Bob proves ignorance and hatred can earn you fun and profit!,"This guy is something, I swear. You have gotta love him for being able to trash every religion on Earth, except for his own, in one small volume. Between supposedly kicking the Devils butt and churning out ignorance, when does he have time for golf? Keep us smiling Bob, you would definitely be missed. By the way, If anyone is really interested in learning about the Church of Satan, Amazon books just happens to sell the Satanic Bible. Hail Satan!"
2,"Gets two stars, it was entertaining. I laughed until I cried","So I guess that false prophets only surface in non-Christian religions? This book did open my eyes to one truth... Modern Christianity is the antichrist. I know alot of christians will read this, so here goes... THINK FOR YOURSELF, DON'T BELIEVE THIS STUFF. Larson lives in fairy-tale land. I love God, I talk to him, he talks back, and believe me, GOD DOES'NT CARE IF YOU DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE, AS LONG AS YOU BEHAVE."
2,Too biased!,Don't buy it! It's full of incorrect statements and frankly a very boring read. There are better books on cults.
1,Calling other religions cults is just bad manners,"How dare this author label other denominations as cults! This is pereptrating religious intolerance and creating conflict amongst religious groups.This is a great book if you are looking at how to criticize another's religion. If you wish to learn about other faiths, study them, not someone else's personal agenda...."
1,This book is absolute trash! Negative 5 stars,"This author is absolute ignorance personified. If you are a ""christain"" don't waste your time reading this book. If you think this is a ""christain"" perspective you are SO WRONG! This guy puts yoga and the KKK in the same category. What an absolute moron! Why would anyone in their right mind think this is a christain book? Let me tell you folks, anyone who spends his life's work on a book about hatred of everyone who is from another culture is just REALLY STUPID!!! This book has absolutely nothing to do with Jesus or REAL CHRISTIANITY. Jesus was a great man, and I believe, the son of God. But I don't try to belittle anyone who is a thinking person with an actual brain. God created EVERYTHING, except IGNORANCE. If you want a Christain perspective? Read the Bible! Don't throw your money away on this garbage. Even if it is only $1.28. That is too much!"
2,Information? Yes. Fair? No.,"This book does contain some interesting information and can lead someone to more sources of information. However, the entire pretext of the book is - ""If you don't believe how I believe, you are wrong and/or misled."" I can't agree with this. There are other religions and beliefs that are certainly beneficial and valid. Larson's overzealous persecution of other religions causes his beliefs and words to lose their power."
1,His labor of love is a labor of hate!,"This man is an ethnocentric hater of all world cultures. He likes to take a superfical view of other religions besides his own. If one has to look at something like cults and religion, one must take an objective approach to the situation. His approach is: if it's not Christian, it is evil. He has many inaccurate information in his book. First of all, the Shiva lingam is NOT PHALLIC! It represents the pillar of light and knowledge to the Hindus. Also, ""man"" is not helpless under the reincarnation cycle, ""man"" works for ""himself"" to acheive that good judgement from God. Don't buy the book, for the book represents conformity and the censorship of new ideas of spirituality."
2,Little more than a series of book reports,"LNBC was compiled and edited by Ministry staffers (esp. Muriel Olson) on Ministry time -- about all that Larson did was collect the royalties. And it shows. The ""research"" is cursory at best, and any real insight is notable by its absence."
2,A Christian bigot spin,"Amazing! This guy must have problems! WHOA! The book simply denigrates people of other faiths and says their wrong because they have things that are not supported in the bible(You know, the book that says bats are birds!)If I were a Hindu I could write a book just like this and place Christianity in it and say ""YO BOB! Right back at you!"" To me this book is a little biased in that looks at things in a one sided view. Further more the book takes things out of context and creates half truths about other faiths.Okay! So maybe not all religions can be true and maybe some of these religions have a few issues and things like how Prophecies made by the Jehovas witnesses never came true, but I can easily point out problems with Christianity as well.My Advice is if you really want this book be forwarned, it is not what it seems."
1,A noble effort but highly inaccurate information,"I have decided to take time to write this review in order to protect those seeking understanding. I have studied the world religions and the occult for over 15 years. I am a protestant exorcist, so these studies are relevant to my field. I do not disagree with Mr. Larson's christianity, however I do disagree with misrepresenting the doctrines of other religions. As a christian myself, my integrity will not allow me to give a false testimony against another. Some of the information that this book lists as the belief and practice of these religions is highly inaccurate (I hope not purposely misleading). I have unfortunately found this to be true of some of his other work as well. I do not recommend this book. I recommend a strong knowledge of the Bible combined with historical studies of the faiths in question, if you wish to gain an accurate knowledge of the comparative differences between christianity and the world religions."
1,Larson smears the great religions of the world,"It's obvious that Larson has never met or corresponded with many adherents of the religions he trashes. His take on Hinduism, Buddhism, and other religions is just plain dishonest, filled with misstatements, innuendo, and blather.As for Buddhism, if a Christian really wants to know what that's about compared to Christianity, ""Living Buddha, Living Christ"" by Thich Nhat Hanh would be recommended.If you want the truth, don't waste your money on Larson"
2,Highly Misleading,"This is allegedly a treatise on ""cults"" and a delineation of their ""errors.""Don't be fooled: When Larson says ""cult,"" he means ""every religion that isn't his particular brand of evangelical Protestantism."" (In fact, some of his ""cults"" are not even religions!)When he says ""errors,"" he means ""beliefs with which he disagrees, or practices of which he disapproves.""And as if that weren't bad enough, he makes comments about some of these groups which are at least pointlessly insulting if not downright libelous (comparing Unitarian Universalism to schizophrenia, trotting out the tired old defamation of Pagans as devil-worshipers, et cetera).In short: If you're in absolute agreement with Bob Larson, you'll probably feel vindicated. If not...read M.T. Singer's ""Cults In Our Midst"" instead."
4,Great Children's Reading,"I grew up reading the Little Miss and Mr. Men series, and I have only rediscovered them. They are great little morality tales, with simple characters and a simple lesson.Little Miss Late features the great cartoon art of Mr. Hargreaves, and teaches young children the ramifications of lateness.Great children's reading. I am amassing a collection for my future children."
5,be sure to read the specs !,"I got this amp to run 2 opitdrive lanzar 12""s and in the specs it says u can run it at .5 ohm.

I got it fixed at ran then at 2ohm . U can hear them 3blocks away LOL.. i reccomend getting this amp lanzar is top of the line!!!"
1,Deserves A Zero: Possibly The Worst Progressive Attempt.,"This, may very well be the worst attempt of any band in this genre. When you hear GREAT bands, like Dream Theater and Symphony X, you know after really listening to them, that not just any band can put together true progressive metal and pull it off. In Magellan's case, it sounds like weird experimental-type stuff that NO ONE except the band can enjoy or even understand musically. My advice would be to check out other bands, like Dream Theater, Symphony X, Liquid Tension Experiment, all leaders in the progressive genre, and masters at it. ZERO RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF PROGRESSIVE POWER METAL."
2,Waste of money,"This c.d. isn't worth more than 2 bucks at best. Track 4 has some pretty cool guitar riffs, but none of the songs have any dirction. They sound like a retarded version of Dream Theater, and I have a feeling that they were trying really hard to copy them."
4,Test of Wills is just a fun look at the prog metal scene,"I bought this cd after listening to another piece by the same writer, trent gardner. I was extremely pleased with the other piece's time changes and complexity and depth to the writing(Age of Impact, by Explorer's club). I bought Test of Wills hoping for the same. What I got was a slightly scaled down version of the original. The strange time is all there, and even a bit in excess, but it's got fun grooves and cool drum patterns that make you wish Terry Bozzio was playing on this one of Gardner's treats like he was on Explorer's Club. Overall, it's a quality album, and if you're new to Magna Carta Records this isn't a bad place to start."
5,CRITICS CARNIVAL,"OK so there is some vintage prog influences to be found herebut this acts main man is Trent Gardner (MR MAGNA CARTA)he in himself is a melting pot of ideas, fresh and originaland has worked with many greats like STEVE HOWE and STEVE WALSHto many others to mention here. The bottem line isthis is a great CD, music for musicians ,cutting edge progressivealso very much suited to the thinking person, however it is a tadbombastic. 9.5/10"
4,the popular radio of my childhood,"For me this is some of the best cowboy music ever.For many years Gene Autry was the king of the singing cowboys.My first real remembered listening to him was in my Dad's car on a sunday afternoon drive on the Radio.Western movies and music of this sort is like jazz, a very American productthat may not be very appreciated by New York intellectuals,but is recognized the world over as being an American type of music.I like this batch of songs."
3,Melody Ranch radio stuff....,"If you're looking for the original ""hits"", don't buy this. If you're into rare radio from the ""Melody Ranch"", and want to hear rare, live, alternative tracks, this is for you. I'm a big Gene Autry fan, so I couldn't turn this off! ""Don't Fence me In"" is slowed down, missing the instrumental break, has a cool choir back-up, and was quite a shock to me. These are not the original Columbia recordings, most are radio broadcasts, but the sound quality is great, and all 3 CDs flow nicely. If you are from the era that spawned this wonderful music, I'm sure you will swoon! I was looking for the recorded versions that I was familiar with, so this collection was a bittersweet find. Still, well worth the money!"
5,Inspired,"I can't think of a better word to describe this book than - INSPIRED! You will be blessed by this book. Grab a cup of coffee or tea, get comfortable on the couch and.....enjoy."
3,Misses the boat,"American Experience biographies are usually exceptionally well-produced and narrated. Generally they are the definitive examination of their subjects, but they dropped the ball in this look at the life of Harry Truman. Truman led a fascinating and multi-faceted existence, but the entire documentary falls flat. The only riveting segment was the coverage of the '48 Truman-Dewwy campaign, but the coverage of Truman's early life and later years was disappointing. There is scant illumination of the life of Bess, Harry's beloved wife and an integral part of his story.Truman lived for another 20 years after he left the White House, but you'd never know it from this treatment. They blandly narrate Harry's remaining years in a few minutes and then hastily conclude the biography. It's a shame because Truman is an American icon and deserves a fresh, vibrant treatment. This is perhaps the most disappointing American Experience biography I have yet seen."
4,The danish way,"It is easy to hear (and see) that Brge Rosenbaum (his original name) is still a large part of Victor Borge when he returns to his own childhood and H.C. Andersen. He is not reading, and he is not using any one of the available translations, he is telling the stories that he knows by heart - and he knows the stories so well, that he is able to take liberties, without harming the story-line. He does not believe in the current idea of toning down the gruesomeness of the stories, knowing that this too is an aspect of humanity, one that we (even as children) have to confront to overcome it."
5,TOPS Notebook,Just what I was looking for. I wanted one just like the one I finished filling with memories of driving my Corvette.
1,Class book too late :(,"The book itself was not brand new. There was writing on the front cover and pages inside the book were folded. It was not in a ""brand new"" state. I also tried contacting the vendor by e-mail and I never got a response. I then tried Amazon directly and they told me the book was already shipped but it took 3 weeks to get to me. The book was not brand new and the 3-4 day shipping took 3-4 weeks. I needed the book for class and had to read it in less than a week. Next time I'm sticking with the bookstore even thought they are expensive I know what I'm getting."
5,"Great product, work to get in",Great product MOOG is a great brand its used only on the highest model of my car. If you have time install them yourself but if not have them installed. I did them myself and it took some work but it got done. it helps that they are greasable too.
1,worhtless,"I bought 2 for a boating trip. First one developed a pin hole in a corner the first time it was used. It only touched the fiberglass boat and a wood dock. The second one started leaking a few days later, not sure where.I hoped they would last at least one trip, but no such luck.To get a partial refund, I would have to pay for shipping it back, so landfill is the best option."
3,"Does its job, but just that.","While this water carrier serves its purpose, the thickness of its plastic makes it neither fully collapsible nor rigid enough for resting on anything but a very flat surface. It's functional, but not flawless."
4,Wedding Gift,Can't wait to use this. We actually got two of these (the blue and this clear one) for when we go camping. it's make of good materials and it was delivered to us in a very timely manor.
4,"No surprises, this is my second set, sold the car with the first set.","A sturdy product and easy to install. I much prefer the in-channel mount over the exterior version for a cleaner look and more secure mounting.Manufacturer's packaging was .. OK....nothing broken but the foam pieces stuck in between the parts to prevent chafing of the plastic were too small, too thin and not properly placed to protect the compound shape at the ends. My set had some unsightly chafing marks which I buffed out with headlight lens compound.This set had the same problem with preventing windows closing that my previous set had in that the sharp edge on the bottom corners of the rear window shades hung up on the top edge of the glass when rolling up the windows which prevents closing. I filed a bevel on the bottom edges inside the channel with a nail file to allow the edge of the glass to ride past that corner and continue closing."
1,Cheap cardboard backing,"This has a very flimsy cardboard backing, which makes writing on the pad (without putting it against a table or wall) difficult. My previous pads (from Publisher's Supply Inc) were much better."
3,Big let down after Diary of a Blues Goddess,This book really never hit a full climax. It was interesting yet a bit boring and unrealistic. I was able to finish it but skimmed much of the end.
1,Horrible,"I hate to be so negative, but I just thought this book was awful. I've read most of the Red Dress Ink books and loved them, but when I picked up this one, I was so bored. This is very much unlike other RDI books, and not in a good way. When it was over, I immediately took it to half-price books. For the love of Pete, save your time and money and read another RDI book."
5,"Sandra Bullock, read this","OK, so maybe after making 28 Days, which plays fairly continuously in most rehabilitation centers, Sandra Bullock wouldn't want to play the hard-drinking heroine of this book. But it will definitely be a movie one of these days. Witty, sophisticated, a marvelous surprise for one who hasn't read a romance since since her Victoria Holt days in highschool. A character real enough to make me wonder what Cassie is up to right now in. . .but I won't spoil the surprise. This one is ripe for a sequel."
5,Absolutely Loved It!,"I thought Spanish Disco had a great story line that captured my interest from the very first page. By the middle of the book, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I am anxiouly awaiting the next novel by Erica Orloff!"
4,S&S rainsticks,"This product had everything in the kit necessary to make the project, even a table cover. We had 3 adult helpers for a 20 child class aged 6-11. Adults used hot glue gun to put on both end caps, so the kids could use the craft quickly without beads spilling on the floor. We prepped the project with one cap on end of tube and pipe cleaners already taped inside. The jute was precut with the beads and feathers hot glued to the ends. The children then decorated their paper with markers, pencils, jewels, or stickers, then glued the paper to the tube. This made the project about 30-40 minutes."
3,We want the original publishing date!!,"I want to know when the content of any book was previously published. When you don't do that, I believe you are being deceitful, dishonest and /or lazy. These are not good attributes when posting a book by such a delightful author who lives his religious beliefs. Shame on you.Keep on writing those great books, Father!!"
4,Fits the Buzz Lightyear Shooter!! Better Foam!,"I bought these refills in the hope that they'd fit the Buzz Lightyear Space Shooter - THEY DO! They're a sturdier foam than the original disks, but shoot just fine.Four stars instead of five on the price, LOL, but at least they WORK."
4,Good refils,"The discs are perfect refills for the gun. And if you play with them alot, you're bound to loose some, so refils are the way to go."
4,refills work fine,these refills work well with the shooter I bought; very durable. A little hard to load but other than that its fine
2,Underwhelmed,"This looks like is is all metal but it has a bunch pf plastic parts. The oil control either is ""a lot"" or none - very hard to get ""just a little"". The pressure regulation seems OK."
5,A Must buy !,"I recently met Sam at a ski trip from our church in Memphis and I bought his cd ""Beg the Sky"" and I love it! My favorite songs are Sunflower Land and Ten Times Stronger, which make very good motivational songs for anybody in a period of crisis; be it small or large."
4,Sam pours his whole self into each song.,Sam's first ever album is great. You can tell just by listening that has lived each moment he sings about. But his joys and struggles are defintely things that almost everyone can relate to. His emotions are are our emotions. Sam just knows how to make them all beautiful and heartfelt. There is no doubt that God will bless this great new artist.
5,Don't Go Another Day Without,"I might be a little biased, having known Sam as a friend for 3 years, but I gotta tell you, this CD is something else. ""Two Friends"" literally made me cry when Sam played it when we worked together at a camp 3 years ago, and still brings great emotion. ""Finest Hour"" and ""How I Wish"" are two of my new favorites. With the mix of wonderful music, and heartfelt lyrics, the only way to go wrong is to not get it! Can't wait for the follow-up CD!"
5,Be Your Own Doctor,I cannot believe the wisdom of this Ann Wigmore-she has been able to put on paper how to use the things freely given to us to help heal our bodies-we just need to do it and get well. This book was pricey and old but I didn't care about that -all I wanted was the information.
3,Pick up if you're a Yeshead or Sherwood fan,"Of both WT albums, I definitely think this one has the better material, although, it's not at a Yes/Conspiracy level. The highlights for me are ""One By One By One"", ""The Evolution Song,"" and particularly ""The Wake of the Storm"", clearly the best track of the non-Squire infused tracks. The version of Say Goodbye is not as good as the one on Conspiracy, even though you can hear Squire's vocals more on this release.Definitely pick it up if you're a 90's Yes/Sherwood/Squire fan, definitely an interesting listen.The one con: Not an easy album to find; I had to mug Bruce Gowdy on the street and steal his copies."
4,Euphoria,"An excellent progressive rock album loaded with intelligent lyrics and muscianship. Perhaps not as strong as their first album, but nevertheless a welcome addition to any prog rock fan's CD collection. Tracks ""Dark Sky"" and ""Golden Age"" are World Trade at their best. Its a pity Billy Sherwood (the main creative genius of World Trade) has now taken up residency with Yes. The world needs more World Trade albums based on what Euphoria offers."
3,Try their first album instead!,"""Euphoria"" does not represent World Trade's best work. The first album, ""World Trade"",(1989 on Polygram) is the real thing featuring solid writing, dynamic performances and excellent progressive sensibility. Unfortunately that debut album is now deleted (since all but a few critics ignored it) but it's possibly available in second-hand CD stores."
5,Great stuff for Yes/Squire fans,"If you know ""Conspiracy"" - the latest joint venture of Chris Squire and Billy Sherwood - you also know World Trade's ""Euphoria. That's not a conincidence: Most of the musical work has been done by Sherwood, and Chris Squire even has co-written two songs. Both have been playing together on the last two Yes albums (""Open Your Eyes"" and ""The Ladder""), so it doesn't come as a surprise that the music is heavy reminiscent of the more recent Yes works. It's really fun listening to this music!"
1,Prog Lite from a former (LATER era) Yesman,"This cd came out in 1995. Combine the mid-tempo four-square rock beats of bands like Collective Soul with a sort of Yes prog-rock aesthetic (okay, maybe more like Asia than Yes), and add really corny Ozzy-style ""Oh my God we're all doomed"" lyrics, and you've got ""Euphoria."" With all the post-punk new-wave music that has come out since the Sex Pistols declared bands like Yes and Pink Floyd ""dinosaurs,"" it's difficult to listen to this cd and not laugh. No wonder I missed this one when it first came out (I only got tippped off to it while revisiting the early prog rock bands of the 70's with a friend who has a more extensive overview of this camp of musicians). This came out the same year as ""I Care Because You Do"" by Aphex Twin. Buy the Aphex Twin disc. Instead of being 15 years BEHIND the times, Aphex Twin is 25 years AHEAD."
5,El Destroyo's Second Album features Femme's Brian Ritchie...,"El Destroyo's new the alterna-star lineup (including the Violent Femme's Brian Ritchie and former 4 Non Blond Roger Rochas) and Brian Ritchie production credit may find El Destroyo more listeners. At the core of the folk-pop band's sound are the naive melodies of Jimmy Friedman, moving from Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen depth (""Central Park"") to Daniel Johnston inanity (""Hey Everybody,"" ""Christen Brett"") and Saturday morning cartoon melody (""Those Kids""). The instrumentation is classic: retro, '60s folk revival, new wave, and a dollop of power pop meet ultra space age bachelor pad. ""Everyday"" has a breezy string melody by Yuki Ki Chai and some crazy atypical dusky vocals by Friedman; ""My Voice (Yeah-Yeah)"" repeats the formula with a twisted Lee Hazelwood/Nancy Sinatra groove. ""Heaven"" is Cohen meets the Beatles. All over the map, and fans of eclecticism will flip over the musical borders smashed by El Destroyo."
2,Sardines for sale,"I like spicy food and I like sardines, but I don't like these. I simply cannot finish my pack of 10 cans. I like other Vigo sardines and I wouldn't say these are low quality, but something about the mixture of these strong flavors doesn't work for me. I can taste them for hours."
4,"Hot, but not hot enough","Sardines packed in oil (soy, olive and EVOO) are too bland for me. I've tried them with green chilies, chipotle and Louisiana hot sauce. These Vigo are hotter than the others, but not by much. I kick it up a notch with Tabasco Habanero or Jalapeno sauce. If you like 'em midly hot, these may be just right for you."
3,Ok for the price,"On the whole a good effort that falls a bit short--not very hot and spicy, a bit too much salt, and a rather inconsistent texture of the fish among separate cans. Ok, but could be better."
2,A few hypersalty mushy sardines per can,"On my personal scale of 0 (worst) to 5 (best) IMHO, these affordable sardines that I have bought and tasted repeatedly in 2011 are rated by me as follows:odor 2/5;presentation 3/5;taste 3/5;texture 2/5 andquantity in can 3/5.I will not buy again."
3,Soldiers fight more then the Taliban,"Soldiers fight more then the Taliban in this film. Oops we woke up a demon and now we must pay in odd and spooky ways. This is a very original tail with a good cast and odd setting. The female Afghanistan is very pretty and creepy as the woman who is put in the middle of this mess or is she more then that? There is some nice gore effects but the demon it's self is pretty iffy CGI, but you can not have everything. The acting is good and the fast pace will keep you locked in and trying to figure out how are boy's are going to get out alive. A movie with a fresh story that is worth a look."
2,A decent little horror film,"I caught this on starz the other night. Unlike some of the other reviews I thought the cast in this movie was great. The story is just average but the movie never bored me. Kind of reminded of the movie The Thing, except in the desert. Decent."
2,Better alternative,You can get the two disc set of all the best Fat Boys tracks on the origional fatboys website for 15 dollars free shipping. It would also be money directly supporting them.
3,Can't Listen to the Whole CD,"The Fat Boys will be great eternally. However, the CD is only great at the beginning. The first few tracks are irresistable! This music bring back the memories of rap's beginnings. Stoked fans like myself, waiting by the radio with my fingers ready to depress Play and Record to catch and etch songs onto my cassette. ""Jailhouse Rap"" is my all-time Fat Boys favorite, but there are a few bars missing, you feel me? Why did they dit out bars from this song? I was definitely upset when they shortened that song. I really want to see the video which brings me to another complaint: enhance it! Give us a couple of Fat Boys' videos on the CD for the true fans who know that BET is not going to play Fat Boys videos every now and then."
2,beaware,"The Fat Boys are one of my favorite old school hip hop groups. Their first cd is a classic. I am only giving this cd 2 stars because the songs FAT BOYS, CAN YOU FEEL IT, JAIL HOUSE RAP and a couple of other songs are not the full version, they are the cut short version. I bought this cd thinking all the songs was the full version. I feel i was ripped off. So true Fat Boys fans beaware, STAY AWAY. Buy the vinyl version of the Fat Boys first cd to get the full versions."
5,Leave your brains at the door-It's all about fun,"Like Austin Powers, Freddie and the Dreamers, and the Three Stooges (with Curly), do not rate this CD by normal, serious critical standards. This is all about FUN and LAUGHS from something so OUTRAGEOUSLY bad that it's GOOD! The Human Beat Box, for those of us who remember, had a wild sound that defies written description. The HBB, along with Kool Rock Ski and Prince Markie Dee (I can't believe I remember these names!) use this to great effect in songs like ""Can You Feel It,"" ""Fat Boys,"" my favorite ""Don't Be Stupid,"" and ""Wipe Out!"" This is rap strictly for the sake of having a good time, something that is rarely heard these days. Yes folks, this music is good and stupid as it was meant to be, so don't rate this with the same standards as you would with Natalie Cole."
5,The most misunderstood/underrated rap supergroup in history!,"Don't believe for a second that the FAT BOYS were just a gimmick or a ""one hit wonder"" due to their hit ""WIPEOUT"".The FAT BOYS were so much more -- mentored by Kurtis Blow and centered around Buff the Human Beat Box, the FAT BOYS:1) Represented a time when it was okay for hip hop to be about having fun and accepting yourself;2) Are credited with creating the art of Beatboxing (yes this is definitely disputible!);3) Were talented rappers who always came off with great rhymes, quality songs, and were so seriously underrated that most people these days don't even know what they are missing.You should really not hesitate to get this release if you in any way, shape or form, consider yourself a fan of REAL hip-hop."
4,Good product,"Pros:1) Lighter weight (compare to others that uses actual weight)2) It works from upper body to lower body (bench to squad)Cons:1) Since it uses bows, I do not feel much of negative weight (It has some negative weight)Conclusion:Since lots of sports stores carry bowflex nowadays, go there try it first. It is almost effective as GYM (My body is less sored than GYM). Saving me a time to go to GYM and I work out more. It's worth money (I bought a use one - paid much less)."
1,Poor Movie,This movie has an agenda and it a poor excuse for a movie describing the Vatican. It is obviously done by non religious people who take a look at the Vatican from a secular viewpoint.
3,COLLECTED ESSAYS ON LIFE AFTER DEATH,"Gary Doore, PhD, EditorWhat Survives?Contemporary Explorations of Life After Death(Los Angeles, CA: Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc. 1990) 287 pagesEssays on life after death by: Steven Levine, Ram Dass, Colin Wilson,Kenneth Ring, Charles Tart, Sogyal Rinpoche, Stanislav Grof,Stanley Krippner, D. Scott Rogo, & several others.Most of these thinkers come at the problem with 'new age' perspectivesand various forms of old and new 'spirituality' and shamanism.Colin Wilson believes in life after death because of paranormal experiencessuch as communication with the dead.Tibetan Buddhism is well represented.The book presents no unified conclusions, but it is a good place to begin.If you would like to read reviews of other books on life after death,search the Internet for the following exact expression:""IS THERE LIFE AFTER DEATH? THE BEST BOOKS"".James Leonard Park, skeptic"
2,All About Kayaking? More like Kayaking 101.,"A better and more honest description would have been ""An Introduction to Kayaking.""The DVD introduces you to the different types of kayaks & kayaking along with accessories like paddles & safety gear, but doesn't even show how to do something as elemental as rolling a kayak upright. If this is supposed to cover everything about kayaking, it's interesting that they advertise a whole series of DVDs on aspects of kayaking at the end. I didn't appreciate the misrepresentation of this DVD, and would have looked elsewhere for information had I known it was so elementary. It is an expensive advertisement for their other kayaking DVD's."
1,gray paper,Only bought because I wanted purple paper. It is really more of a gray color. The book itself is nice quality.
3,Rusk Ceramic,I was really excited to get this iron...it gets really hot hot hot....burnt a whole curl off....I suggest using it around the 350 setting otherwise....scary!!! I've had it for a few months and Im getting use to it now...but be careful..
1,There's No Way Out for the wwe Superstars,I don't think this years wwe No Way Out will be any good I'm actually predicting Career Suicide for John Cena for this years wwe No Way Out I'm predicting that Randy Orton Cody Rhodes Ted Dibiase and Manu will lay out John Cena in the Parking Lot and John Cena will recover and go out to the ring and challenge all four of them to a Hell in a Cell Match at this pay per view that's right I said it John Cena vs Randy Orton Cody Rhodes Ted Dibiase and Manu Handicap Hell in a Cell match at this pay per view if he does that there's no doubt in my mind that it will be Career Suicide for him.
4,My Son LOVES IT,I bought this for my son for Easter and he's a HUGE wrestling fan.He LOVES this DVD.
5,Very Happy...,"My father has had nothing but fantastic things to say about Happy Traum and his edcational videos, so I decided to try one myself. Of course, I assumed that I was a little better at fingerpicking than I actually am, and so I got started with this disc, volume 2 & 3. In truth, what sold me was the opportunity to learn Fishing Blues. Man, I love that song. But this disc has been humbling for me. Not to say it's too difficult; it's very solid fingerpicking and he takes great care to explain it. But I've realized that I've still got a few basic fingerpicking things to learn. I have no regrets about buying this disc because Happy is so good, I plan on mastering disc #1, and then this one, and then more. I just realize now that I maybe should have bought #1 as well so I could be sure I had the nuts and bolts down. Check out this series; you'll be glad you did..."
5,Absolutely Stunning,"This is absolutely stunning. The collision of two geniuses, Perlman and Ashkenazy, playing two works by the greatest genius who ever lived, Beethoven. I've had this recording for years now, and I've listened to it plenty of times. Everything is just so expressive and beautifully played.Whether or not you are a purist, you will reach for this recording. I strongly recommend this.If you want to see more reviews of this product, checkBeethoven: Violin Sonatas ""Kreutzer"" & ""Spring""."
3,Incomplete Item Description,"The item is pretty enough, and the size is as described. However, it's got an underwire, and it doesn't say so anywhere in the product description. If the item had been properly or completely described I would not have purchased it."
2,Not one for the bookshelf,"Marima Castinet is great. This book isn't and I'm not just talking about the ever present errors and inconsistencies you'll find in Lemay's books.Beyond the errors and inconsistencies, there's a lot of gray areas and I often wondered if the author really knew the subject. I found this book didn't give me what I needed to use the product--and I'm a fairly proficient Java programmer."
1,Very low battery life,This Sony NPFF71 battery is giving very low backup time. I am getting only 45 minutes of video recording time on my DCR PC108E Handycam. This is a 1560mAh battery. It should give 3 to 4 hours of video recording time.
3,"Great product design, but BEWARE what you order!!!","The product quality is excellent, but BEWARE. According to Antonette at Kamp-Rite, there are supposedly TWO DIFFERENT product numbers for this tent-cot, one with a rainfly (#DTC 443) and one without (#TC 401). After reading the reviews from previous buyers indicating they had a rainfly included, I went ahead and purchased. FogDog did NOT list an item number.Lo and behold, no rainfly.Contacted FogDog, they refer you to Kamp-Rite. Contact Kamp-Rite and they tell you too bad, you bought the wrong one. You need to buy the fly from FogDog for another $30 + shipping + tax.Complete BS. NO tent is ever sold without its matching rainfly!I suggest NOT doing business with this vendor. I'd buy from Vermont Army-Navy instead, they're less expensive anyway. You just have to time it so they have it in stock."
1,Very Poor service,I have been waiting for this product for more than 3 monthes and am still waaiting. Not happy with amazon at all
1,Amazon is slow to ship it;'s products,I have been waiting since October for this thing. I also have a pair of pants that are months late. This is crazy they would not allow one of the other sellers on their site to pull this. No wonder they are in trouble with the Gov. all the time. Oh for the days when companys knew what customer service was. Now service is the kind of service that Bulls give to Cows.
4,Yellow ink cartridge for Brother MFC,"The Brother ink cartridges are true to color and look great printed. My only dissapointment is that the colors don't last very long compared to other home printers I've used in the past. If you buy the MFC printer, go ahead and buy at least 2 cartridges of each color."
3,It's OK,"Way too much of this book is devoted to the history of pottery. The beginning of the book repeats information found in countless other pottery books addressing the reader as a beginner. Then, the instructions for the projects seem to leave out information assuming the reader is experienced in working with clay.I wanted more specific, clearly-written steps in how the author creates her own work."
5,Great handbuilding book,Loved this book. It has nice pictures and good information. I am glad I have it in my collection.
4,Buyer Beware!!,"""Crappie Wisdom"" is a good book, don't get me wrong. I just thought I'd leave a review to make other buyers aware of something I wasn't aware of. InFisherman has another crappie fishing book called ""Slab Secrets"". I just wanted to make everyone aware that it is the SAME book as ""Crappie Wisdom"" as far as material and chapter coverage goes. ""Crappie Wisdom"" has more pictures of people holding up fish but reading material wise they are the same. If you do not have either book I recommend one or the other...great reading material in there that covers a lot of the basics and other useful info."
4,Learn Crappie Fishing,Crappie Wisdom is a good for beginers and old timers. You learn the basics and a lot more. It will teach how to catch crappie and put them on the table ready to eat. How to and illustrations on just about everything you need to know to be a successful crappie catcher. The contributors are well known and experts.
2,Not good,"This is the rich ""Southern Lady"" magazine, not an information sharing format (that I had hoped for) Was not at all pleased."
5,One of the Best in the Business,"As a user of harrriet lane for years...This book goes beyond. As an easy to read, comprehensive resource for almost everything you will see as an inpatient house officer, I would recommend keeping it with you at all times. It is filled with all the questions you find yourself often looking up on those late night calls. It gives you the one line answers you are always looking for. It has information on conditions from the most basic to the most obscure and what you need to know about them. It provides answers to treatment, diagnosis, and guidelines.Most of all it helps you treat patients, provide better care, and teach you at the same time. It includes chart, bold type, and subject heading formats. This book is AWESOME!!! Get yours today"
3,Should be called Everyday Life in AMERICA in 1800's,"I was disappointed when I received this book because I had assumed from the editor reviews that this book was about life in the 1800's in Europe as well as America. That's how it's marketed, but I'd say over 95% of the facts related refer to the United States. If you're looking for a reference book on America in the 1800's then this is good, but not if you're interested in European manners and customs of that time period."
2,"Mediocre, missing essential information, poorly constructed","This book lacks any information about education. Such an essential subject - affecting children and adults alike - should certainly be included.Nor does it include information about art (visual/performing) or literature pertinent to the people at the time.It also has no index, so that searching for anything is ridiculously slow.Visuals are lacking - textual descriptions of hair or various equipment are poor substitutes for an image.Essentially it is a poorly organized dictionary, and stating that it is ""a guide for writers, students and historians"" is an overstatement to say the least!"
3,Misleading,"Maybe I misunderstood based on the title but I believed this was a book that was about daily life in the 1800's. Simple. It is, but you also need to have knowledge of much of the literature of that time as well - including having read Dickens and many other Victorian era writers. If you haven't read many of them you might find yourself lost as I did. For those who are avid readers of this this type of literature it is very thorough and I'm sure interesting."
4,"Useful and informative, but...",A useful book that I've referred to often for short historical fiction. My ONLY complaint about Mr. McCutcheon's reference books in general is that he seems to have an ongoing and frustrating aversion to having an index.
4,Was okay - not as much info as I'd hoped for.,Bought this for research for a novel I'm writing and was a little disappointed in the lack of relevant info.
3,No Frills Serviceable Unit,"I replaced my old Sony Dual Cassette unit, which failed to work after many years ( I am getting fed up from SONY products), although hardly used. I like Pioneer products, right now I have their CD R unit, a very nice piece of appliance.So why only 3 stars for this unit, although the sound quality is good, the Dolby works well?It is without any frills. No remote!! Hardly anything lights up. It looks dead on the shelf and it is not really that cheap. Sure, no one buys cassette decks, unless they have a stash of cassettes not yet converted to CDs. So an unit costing 150$ or so should have some aesthetics!It is still mechanical. After powering up the unit, one has to press the button to start and wait. Annoying. I haven't checked the recording meter, but so little LEDs, that we are used to.Still a serviceable unit. Hope it will last.A word about the dealer: VANNS. Very reliable, quick shipper and no mailing charges, just like Amazon."
4,Good Preview for Trip,I bought this to learn more about the country before a trip. Good premise and well carried out - I felt I knew quite a bit the country and its politics as well as about each woman. And a lot about women's lives before birth control!
5,Sutherland/Pavarotti in fabulous form!,I always buy these reissued discs with some trepidation but this is absolutely worth every cent. It is an excellent remastering and Sutherland and Pavarotti are simply marvelous. This has to be some of Donizetti's most glorious music and the spirit and enthusiasm of the entire cast comes through the speakers from start to finish. Ive played it through three times since it arrived and almost cant get enough of it - great stuff. Sutherland in her heyday was a phenomenal singer -you could buy it for her voice alone.
4,Great Sounding Radio for the Money,"Seperate woofer and tweeter give this retro looking radio a great sound even at loud volumes. Quality can be found in the wood case, LCD panel and smooth knobs.Great radio for the kitchen, den, basement, etc.Pulls in FM stations effortlessly.Its not a Tivoli, but its a third the cost."
1,Seemed nice at first then it went to heck...,"I was pleased with the style, performance and the initial perception of quality when I got my Sangean radio. However, I only had it about two weeks when I noticed the digital display starting to act a little wonky. At first it was some flickering. Then it became extraneous lines. Then it turned into complete gobbledygook. Rendering it virtually useless since I couldn't tell what station it was on while tuning it. Eventually the digital disply completely went blank.I feel like I got burned. I guess I could've gotten a lemon out of a bunch of otherwise good products but when choosing an unknown brand like Sangean it leaves me skeptical of their quality and also leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt I'll ever purchase another one of their products and I can't recommend them to you either."
4,A Very Nice Radio,I purchased this radio to replace a GE product that sounded very good. I needed an FM radio for the bedroom that would look nice and perform well. My favorite station is a low powered one that is difficult to receive and my priority was for a sensitive enough tuner to receive that station. The PR-D2 does an admirable job of receiving all the FM stations in this area that are possible to receive. The sound is quite good for a relatively small radio. Very clear and well balanced. A little more bass response would be nice but not required. The appearance is very nice. Kind of an Art Deco look that would fit in with a Poirot set very nicely. You can't go wrong with this radio for the price. Sangean is not an unknown brand and in fact makes the products for many better known brands.
2,"Interesting design, poor quality, mediocre sound","I had to get a replacement for my first one when the display ran into problems. In researching online I saw that Sangean had display issues on the first lot of these radios. The design is cool, but the audio is nothing to write about, and I would expect better from the 2-way speaker design."
2,Good with Flaws,"I was very happy with this radio until after a year. The display started to fade & now it's totally gone. I contacted Sangean (via Email) I was told to send it in but never did. I use it now in my basement. If it wasn't for this problem, I would give it a very high rating. Excellent sound & reception. The batteries also lasted a long time."
2,Display leaves a lot to be desired,"I purchased the radio after reading the reviews that the there were problems with the display thinking that the company had corrected the issue. Sadly, brand new, right out of the box, the display was faded and hard to read. I contacted Sangean and they offered to exchange it. I also asked would the TV function work in 2009 when broadcasts went digital and they said no. That pretty much sealed the deal for me and I returned the radio for a refund."
2,"Didn't fit, prompt response for refund though","I guess you're spinning the roulette wheel with this product. It came quickly in the mail, but did not fit my Ipod (it looked like it should fit, but no matter how I tried to shove, the Ipod end was just too wide). So I contacted the seller, and the company responded next-day, offering refund or replacement. I opted for the refund, and still have the (useless) cable, but the 2 stars are for the great customer service"
5,Ipod Connector,This Ipod connector is an excellent producteverywere i went they wanted at least $20.00 for this itemi got it for few cents at amazon.comand still working it fits like a charm on my ipod
5,Awesome product.,I resell these on Craigslist for $10 each. They sell like magic when someone needs a cable. Cables are $15-20 in store. Great product brand new at half price for them!Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable for iPod and iPhone (White)
2,Did worked for a week,It worked for a week and then it stopped working. I had to use the original cable to connect the Itouch with my pc. This replacement does not work. It seem very cheap material.
1,"same song, different verse","Same thing as the other reviewers -- works fine as a charging cable, but will not recognize as a synch.I'm sorry I spent money on it and could not in good conscience recommend it to anyone."
1,Bad experience with this cable,"I bought this cable hoping for a reasonably priced alternative to the outrageously priced Apple cable. This cable worked fine to charge my iPod when plugged into an inexpensive 110V USB charger. But I had major difficulties when I tried using it as a synch cable. I had frequent USB lock-ups with this cable plugged in to my laptop (i.e. mouse and keyboard freezing). And when I foolishly tried to update the software on my son's iPod over this cable it trashed the iPod firmware, requiring a full reset of the pod and reload of all music. Given the very low price I guess I shouldn't complain too much, but it went into the trash shortly after it arrived."
2,Apple Sync/Charge USB Cable.,"These cords were not produced by Apple. The packaging states they are SF Planet. The cord will not work on an older computer it totally blanks it out everytime we plug it in. It does work on the new laptop, but it seems to slow it down a bit."
2,Works for data but not charging,"phone says ""charging not supported with this accessory"" - sometimes it will still charge just verrrry slowly. Data works fine, though."
2,IPHONE CHARGER,IT WAS CHEAP IN PRICE BUT IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME.. MUST OF BEEN DEFECTIVE ITEMS THAT I HAD GOTTEN.
1,Had to mark in 1 star because I couldn't mark it none,"Bought 2 and wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. Where the cords attach to the USB and charging ends, they have came apart on one of them and the other charging end doesn't even fit into the iPod. Waste of money. Don't buy it."
2,not good,"did not work over 3 days. i would not recommend any one purchasing this type of cord at all, no"
1,Don't Buy!,This item took forever to ship and when it finally arrived It was not compatible with my 4th Generation IPod Touch.
1,Dont waste your money,you can go on and on buying these cables for 1$ from china or japan but they will always stop working. GUARANTEE they will stop working. ive bought several all stop working. better off buying original from apple and taking good care of it
2,Misleading prod. description!!,"The product description is ATO add a circuit which is not correct since the product is actually a mini fuse add a circuit. I found it after receiving the product that it is not made for ATO type fuse but made for mini fuse. Again, it is not made for ATO type of fuse/fuse block"
3,Not as good as her other singles,"This cd is just ok,the Freestyle mix is great,but the Latin house versions should of been alot better.Michelles best single are ""Mr.Player"" and ""by your side""The remixes.Those two have way superior quality of Freestyle than this single and the original ""by your side"" cd.Hopefully her next single will be alot better."
4,Great little gate - but a little narrow,"Good quality and works well with all the other fencing. The only problem I encountered was that the sidewalk is wider than the gate. Not a huge problem, I just cut the connecting ends off one fence section and use that for one side of the gate. Leaving the bottom supports on helps it stay in place unless I move it. This whole package was a very practical and economic solution when living in an apartment because I can't install permanent fencing."
4,A heartfelt journey that makes you look deep inside yourself,"The tragedy that surrounded Kerry O'Neill's death was one that shocked not only her family, friends and shipmates, but also the nation. I remember, because I was one of Kerry's shipmates at Annapolis.This book not only takes you through a father's painful challenges of coping with the loss of a daughter, but through the memories of that daughter. Kerry was a blazing light with incredible potential, tragically snuffed out.I highly recommend reading this book. It will fill you with sorrow, but it will also show you a glimpse of a woman who was loved by all who knew her. It will show you how the memories and her spirit renewed her father's faith.Most of all, however, it will make you look at yourself, at what you have done in life, and make you reach for a higher goal. Because none of us should ever stop until the race is finished.Carpe Diem"
5,Perfect for brides and grooms,"As someone who doused a burning centerpiece during his own wedding reception, I can relate to this book. It's the perfect bridal shower gift -- good light reading and a manual for anyone planning to survive her wedding with sanity (or at least sense of humor) intact."
5,Great book!,"Each chapter is a different funny story. A well written, enjoyable, easy read (especially in the bathroom! ha!) It'd make a great gift for anyone who's even been to a wedding, let alone IN one."
4,A misunderstood book,"First, let me state that I totally disagree with the previous bad review of this book. The book is not hard to read by any means, but to fully understand and comprehend this book you need a solid background in Marxist theory. I found the book to be very enjoyable and enlightening. The first half the the book, based on Taussig's on research on devil pacts and baptised banknotes in Columbia's Cauca Valley, is very good. The second half of the book, based mainly on the research of June Nash on the ""devil-worship"" of Bolivian miners, does not flow as well. It seems to be a bit jumbled, but nonetheless has some interesting ideas and is worth reading. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Marxism and religion or the anthropology of religion."
2,A tough way to learn advanced finance,"I'm a finance undergrad and currently in an MBA program and had to use this book for my advanced topics in finance class. The book is a difficult read. Hard to mow your way through the subjects and come out feeling like you learned something. CD is only mildly helpful. I also purchased the study guide and it was just as poorly designed/organized/written as the book.If you have to use the book for a class, plan on getting one of Aswath Damordaran's books to supplement it. Damordaran is just hands down a better teacher, author and makes finance fun again."
1,Financial Book Review,"I am an MBA student and had to use this book for my Advanced Finance class. It is the most usless book I have purchased for any MBA class. VERY hard to follow and it provides very complicated and unclear examples of how to solve problems or understand concepts. I also got the study guide which was more helpful than the book itself, but it also was horrible. I am not sure why professors choose this book. I used my other finance books and the Internet to help me get through the class, as this book was hard to read, not well organized and offered little help to answer questions that required financial calculations. You better be up on finance topics, statistics, and know all the little symbols because that's all the book provides you. It does little to help you apply real world solutions to ""theoretical"" problems."
4,An excellent companion to the corporate finance series publi,"Brigham has created another fine book to be used as a companion to his corporate finance text. The only problem is that some chapters are duplicated from the corporate finance text. The chapters are nicely laid out however, and it is easily readable."
3,MISLABELED. A SELF-CONGRATULTORY VOLUME OF PRAISE FOR THE YALE DAILY NEWS,AS A NEWS EDITOR I CANNOT FATHOM THE REASON FOR PUBLISHING THIS.PERHAPS ITS DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTORS GAVE MONEY TO THE OLDEST COLLEGE DAILY.
5,Polarize this!,"When you really do want your pictures to be all that they can be, go Heliopan. I thought the price on Amazon was great (beat my local store by $100). You know you want this....buy it. I use one on bothy the 70-200 and the 100-400. Actually I'm glad I had it on the 70-200, the other day I found the polarizer had been shattered (I'm sure it was either the cleaning lady or a nephew that knocked it off the shelf that lens sits on when I am not using it (earthquakes don't dislodge it, it really does require a human to pick it up and then fumble it) the lens survived without a scratch. I recommend this for all your outdoor lenses."
5,Who Else Wants To Learn Master Salesmanship?,"I'm thankful to Jeffrey for taking the time to research Patterson's work - it's invaluable for today's sales professional.What I liked best about this book was how Gitomer got to the essence of what Patterson was all about as a salesman, and later business leader, and boils it down into easy-to-understand and use principles of master salesmanship.It's absolutely inspirational to me to see examples of how Patterson got fitness and sales process parts to be successfully standardized across a huge sales force, and how well it worked to boost sales quickly, and permanently.Hats off to Gitomer, he did it again, in this excellent foundation/sales insights book that's easy to read and priceless to own. Get it now - fun stuff, and helps you become a better sales pro, too.Ken Calhoun"
2,Not enough meat,"Jeffrey Gitomer makes some good points but nothing I haven't seen before in his weekly columns or ""Sales Caffeine"". I was surprised at how short/small the book was and even more surprised when I saw the extensive use of large fonts, short chapters and wide margins. This is more like an 75 page book - not 130. The main thing that I got out of it was a desire to learn more about John Patterson -- he was an intriguing guy."
4,great resource,"Gitomer does it again.If you found this book to be a review, you really need to get his ""Sales Bible"". Clearly the Patterson book is research into John Patterson, founder of sales principles still used today.If you are buying one book from Gitomer, make it the ""Sales Bible.""The ""Sales Bible"" is a must for any sales person. I refer to it almost weekly, and I've since become self sufficient from a home office. It turns out my best sales manager is ""The sales bible"" and myself. This is the absolute best self motivator.As far as the free e-books, Gitomer is a master marketer. When he has a one day sale, it's not B.S. It really is a one day sale. He's a honest sales rep that means what he promises. Novel concept!Looking for free tips? Go to his web site and sign up for his sales caffine emails. I used his free advice for a year before I even bought a book. Gitomer understands customer loyalty and building relationships and value.If you don't agree, you just don't know Gitomer."
1,I was tricked into buying this book,"I was tricked into buying this book by another author who offered an ""amazing free access to a $250.00 e-book"" if I sent proof of purchase to their web site which I did. The free e-book never happened and they wont answer my e-mails. This book is the type I recall reading when I started selling 45 years ago and is sooo far out of date."
1,ITS NOT MUCH and you dont even get what you pay for!,"A quick 136 page read is not all bad, however the author Jeffrey Gitomer, keeps telling us of Patterson's principles and then sends us to his (Gitomer) website to register for the anwser. I contend this is unauthentic marketing and a contradiction to Jeffery's claim of giving value. GIVE US WHAT WE PAID FOR AND THEN TRY TO SELL US. This is the perfect example of what not to do in sales. He assumes I have read his other books and that what he says is gold. Please give me what I pay for next time, if there is one.John HalloranCertified Gold Exchange, Inc[...][...]"
3,Decent album from Starflyer,"Starflyer 59 is one of my favorite bands, and has been ever since I heard ""Hazel Would"" from this album. I must say that I liked ""Gold"" much better than this album, but if you're a fan of Starflyer's heavier style, then this album is for you."
5,"Sf59 is sure swell. Why, they're tops!","Starflyer 59 is one of the most creative bands around. Their style is unique and will never be duplicated. A few words for Mr.""Blah Blah Blah"" Boros: you can never love God ""too much."""
2,Blah blah blah,"Not very interesting. Mellow and spacey but simply boring. Plus, these guys love God a little too much."
5,GREAT STUFF'N'STUFF,"I bought it today listened to it, liked it, listened to it again, loved it, and just died because of it--it rules!"
5,The start of it all,"This album is ten years old but in a way it never ages. This is a shoegaze masterpiece plain and simple. The album cover is just silver, and the music inside is dark and brooding; leading the listener on a space fueled guitar droning journey. This is how music was meant to be, it sucks you in, and before you know it; it's all over. Jason Martin's vocals are hushed and it provides the perfect compliment to the wall of guitar sound found throughout the album. I like the song ""Sled"", but really you can't go wrong with any of them. If your heartbroken or just want to hear some real talent give Starflyer a try. These guys have been producing some of the best music for the last ten years, and it's your loss if you don't listen."
3,A sonic wall of fuzzy sound!,"Six years ago, my ears first heard the buzzsaw sound of ""Blue Collar Love,"" and Starflyer 59 has been in my CD player ever since. Unfortunately, many of Jason Martin's lyrics are inaudible. This is unfortunate, because when you can understand him, he's usually got something pretty worthwhile to say. He doesn't come out and say what he's thinking, you kind of have to dig for the meaning in all his breathy, swirly vocals. ""Blue Collar Love,"" and ""Monterey"" are by far the best songs on the album. The band has had better releases since this one, but fans of this style of music will want to have it just for the first two tracks."
4,Wonderful experiment in acoustics,"Alvin Lucier sat in a room and recorded a piece of text that explains the process of the piece. He played back the segment of text through speakers and recorded it through microphones on the other side of the room. He then took that recording and repeated the process, subtley enhancing the natural reverbaration and harmonics of the room with each recording. By the end of this 45 minute piece, the text is incoherant and all you're left with is an eerie and haunting amalgomation of overtones and harmonic texture. It is really incredible to hear the piece slowly unfold into a vast desert of returns and space. Highly reccomended for those ready for something very diffferent."
3,Stylist-songwriter,"The artist is in the mold of contemporary coffee-shop-PA-friendly Country with a pleasant yet insistent lead vocal, often competing with the unnecessarily aggressive guitars masking some very agreeable chants. Should have kept it simple on this collection for a modestly-sized, healthful neighborhood haunt.I think slowing down the tempos and keeping the rhythm guitar on the beat would have helped; pushing Laura's voice up just a tad would have made a big difference, especially in standout tracks like the title tune; Don't Come To Me; and the superb meeting of panoramic lyric and the lilting lead vocal line on the meditative beat ballad, Rust In The Carolinas."
2,Not what we expected,"Lou Rawls has a great voice, but guess this is just too ""night-clubby"" for our taste. Thought this would be more of a blues album, instead of a cocktail room scene. This is okay if you like that sound, just wasn't prepared for the music...should have researched it more I guess."
5,Just What I Wanted,"I had heard Lou Rawls singing on the radio last week and I realized that I did not have any of his CD's in my collection. I especially wanted the song ""You'll Never Find..."" This CD has all the songs I wanted. It's just great!"
2,Not charged up at ALL,"I charged the battery used it for a very limited time ,it did hold the charge at ALL. I am dissappointed with the product I was hoping to get home movie made with my son as he left on deployment,THAT DID NOT HAPPEN...Regretfully disappointed customer,Melissa F"
4,Could've been better...,"I had been anticipating Mario's new album after constantly hearing Just a Friend 2002 on 106 & Park everyday and went out and bought it the day after it was released. I was disappointed when I first listened to the album, but it's starting to grow on me now. There are a few songs I skip over, which are C'mon and Braid My Hair. I'm not feeling the beat in C'mon, and I just can't get into Braid My Hair. I think he's got a really great singing voice, though. My favorite songs are What Your Name Is and 2 Train. I'm also feeling Holla Back, Girl in the Picture, Never, and Chick Wit Da Braids. And I sometimes like to listen to Put Me On. I thought he could've put more songs on the CD, 'cause it's way too short. But overall, this is a pretty good album. It's worth buying.P.S. There's a really cute poster of Mario included. :)"
4,Mario- the new guy,"Mario is full of talent. He has broken into the music world with his first hit Just a Friend, which is about him trying to get a gurl, but her saying he's just a guy friend. And I also like 2 Train, about him meeting a gurl and her having to sneak around to meet him because she ain't aloud to date yet. Both songs mentioned have up beat, makes you feel good lyrics. C'mon is another love song, where he's trying to get the gurl to come with him and again I like it, but it's not my fav. Overall, the CD is good and i reccomend it to basically teenage gurls who can't get enough of these talented young boys with pop songs and up beat lyrics.--Ashley"
1,This shucks!,"Hello, I'm 11, I hate this cd. Thank you for your time. I only listened to 1 song and watched one music video. I felt there was no need to and I was better off stealing candy from the Kwik-E-Mart. Has anyone else noticed the ""interesting"" dance move those young wanna-be rapper are doing these days? I personally hate it and think NOBODY should look like rubber for the sake of selling albums! Moving on, you probably think I don't listen to music or like old bands (nothing against old bands). I personally listen to Eminem, Outkast, Aaliyah, P.O.D., Linkin Park (yea, I know so many people who hate teen pop hate them to, I know they're not origional but I love their music), Alicia Keys (but I do agree she was overhyped) and Enya. PEACE OUT!"
3,Come here for the truth about Mario,"This is Jospeh's youngest daughter,When this Cd first came out i couldn't believe that somebody actually found a boy with talentBraid My hair and Just a friend made it all the way with me.Hopefully we can keep him just the way he is, i just got his new Cd the turning point, so maybe he decided to follow the sex crazed omarion and his brother marques but who knows.Mario you were on the right track with this CD don't follow the rest of them"
5,"Solid debut from a youngster, good old fashion R&B/Soul","Even a 44 year old like myself can appreciate a excellent CD from an extremely talented new artist from J records. Superb melodies, great hooks, modern lyrics (""Holla Back""), and just plain good songs are all featured on this excellent recording. Favorites are ""Could U Be"", ""2 Train"", ""Holla Back"", ""What Your Name Is"", just to name a few. Hands down, Mario 'IS' the best new talented artist to come around in years.........this is the real thing....he has a voice!"
3,Mario- Mario,"Well i will tell you that mario is extremely talented considering he was only 15 at the time of this album. That helped him alot. Because while you can tell by most of the tracks are elementary party songs. But its the occasional mid tempo love song that really shows the promise that Mario really has. Such as on the Underdogs produced track ""What Your Name Is"" which has mario singing to his girl about how age aint nothing but a number. It has a real soothing mid tempo beat to it. Then there is the track ""Chick Wit The Braids"" which also shows his talent with the mid tempo tracks. But he tends to faid away from his mature subject matter on songs like , ""Holla Back"" and ""Put Me On"", but thats to be expected from a 15 year old singer. But that still makes it immature song matter. But none the less Mario has got some serious talent and i see him being around for a while.Grade:C"
4,Can you braid my hair.,People i loved this cd.Alot of friends were on me for getting this because he was so young and I was feelin his style.This is another cd where you can play all the way through.I think it was a great first effort. Too bad he didn't stick with it.
2,I would've expected more,"It was a pretty good start for Mario and the songs are ok but hearing songs like Just a freiend, C'mon, and Braid my hair you would expect more songs with a funky tune or slow melodic beat. Hopefully mario will do better in the future."
2,the next thriller no way,"okay it seems kids remaking old rap songs are [popular] now. i would not consider this kid nowhere on michael jackson's level, at least mike when he was young stood out and was a pioneer that paved the way for these thugs in training to follow. None of these kids out singing, rapping or whatever will ever go to mike's level so stop trying clive davis really wanna cash in on the hip hop-r&b thing. Lack of creativity big time this is really for teenage girls going through a teen idol phase."
3,"A decent ""B"" movie...","Val Duran, our hero, works on the set of several B action movies, not unlike the book itself. It would have (and often reads like) a solid screenplay. There is not a lot of depth to the characters and frankly it is hard to care about them. There are some interesting points to each of them, but they are not explored. The ending was a good solid suprise, but it does not rescue what is a really a fairly interesting story, but no more. There are some laughs... This book was not a waste, but there are so many better thrillers out there..."
4,Enjoyable read that James Hall fans should try.,"A big improvement over ""Dead Silence"" (which featured a bad guy so all powerful he was meant to be able to go around stealing fighter jets) the enemies here are all more believable. Elmore Leonard has been mentioned as a reference point for this book but it seems to me to carry echoes of James Hall's work - especially where tight squeezes underwater come up (or rather don't). A nice plot twist adds to the enjoyment and I look forward to more from Robert Ferrigno."
2,Stylish but Weak,"I was able to compare this amplified antenna directly with the Zenith UN-amplifiend indoor HDTV antenna. The Zenith was at least 25% to 50% better at pulling in the weaker stations.This RCA antenna LOOKS very nice with its wavy styling. But then you have to pull out its rabbit ears and set them askew to pick up a decent signal! That kills the styling advantage. And its soooo touchy about its positioning to pick up weaker stations, you practically have to do a voodoo dance and wave a plucked chicken around the TV to get some stations that the Zenith pulls in with barely any trouble.So don't let your wife talk you into getting the RCA for its looks. Buy the Zenith instead!"
2,RCA Antenna,"I ordered this, hooked it up and I got nothing, even tried an antenna booster..still nothing. Its a brand new TV with dvd player. But the antenna did not work for it. I returned it and had to pay for shipping. So I was out $7."
1,antenna breaks,"I don't have many good things to say about this product. It looks cool, and it pulls in stations better than a non-amplified antenna.It is easily broken. the telescoping antennas break off at the base during the frequently needed adjustments. Now mine doesn't even look cool because I have had to replace both antennas with some speaker wire that I had laying around the house. I think the wire actually gets a better signal. My advice is to get a different amplified antenna, anything has to be better than this one."
1,cheaply made,The thin atntenna broke in two within the first month.In less than two months both antennaes broke off at the base. Now it pulls in no signals.If I had known it was so fragile I'd have not purchased it. Initially I did get a good reception. none now
2,WOULD ONLY BUY FOR CITY USE,I bought this because of the larger amplifier asI live out in the country. I could only get one stationand only in black and white. The Tv stations are 40miles from here. I returned the item.
2,Disappointing,"This is the first Little Bear video I have purchased for my two-year old daughter. It is also the first ""Nick Jr."" video. I must say I was extremely disappointed in the video's quality (picture not clear) and the amount of advertising at the beginning (almost 10 minutes!). I wanted a video about Little Bear and had to sit through (the remote for the video was nowhere to be found) advertising for Blues Clues, Rugrats, and other Nick Jr. products before finally getting to the ""feature presentation."" Very disappointing."
3,good value for three cool songs,"this is worth buying because of three really cool songs: dizz knee land, girlfriend, and not enough time. the rest of the tracks are only so-so."
5,MEJOR BANDA DE MEXICO,"I LOVE EL TRI MUSIC,I LIKE THE TYPE OR ROCK THEY PLAY I HAVE LIKE 6 OR 7 OF THEIR CD'S AND I LOVE THEM ALL."
5,"Awesome indie, all dialogue","Almost nothing happens in this road film of two brothers driving around LA, yet you don't mind because the snappy repartee between them is the whole point. At turns comic, sad, wry, sarcastic and poignant, this little film also has a nice indie soundtrack that goes perfectly with the homemade vibe of the whole thing. The bit players are uniformly great, from the nosy old man neighbor, to the mysterious desert lady to the transsexual prostitute. The Mexican gas station attendant is the funniest, to me. There's a little twist at the end that sums the whole thing up nicely. Well worth your time."
2,Is Brooke listening? We're still waiting for your video!,"I have Brooke Siler's original book (March 2000). It is still the best book on Pilates method out there, but however good it is - we all know - nothing, but nothing beats a lesson on video. That is why The Pilates Body Kit is such a let down. One would think that in the past three years Ms. Siler was working on a companion video to her popular book. Why the author chose to produce this kit with cards and audio cds is very perplexing, considering the there are so many Pilates method videos out there (good and not so good). Ms. Siler has missed her chance to produce a superior one."
2,Don't waste your money,"The two cd's that come with this are strictly audio ( I was hoping for visual examples of the movements.) You hear a female voice basically walking you through each movement. Really redundent since the cards cover the same material. The flash cards are alright, but really don't show you very many different exercises. The workbook is basically a blank book for you to record your workout progress. Pilates in nothing more than hyped up callistenics/gymnastic/yoga/isometric/stretching moves, which if done religiously will tone the body, but most of the exercises are ones I have alreay seen and done reading other basic exercise books. If you think this is going to do more for you than any other exercise program, stop dreaming and just get to work with what you already know and save your money, wish I had. This product is nice packaging and slick marketing but nothing more. Pilates for Dummies which I bought with this order will be the product I use."
4,Good for those who are not always in front of a DVD,"I bought Brook's original book and found it well rounded. This CD set with accompanying flash cards accompanies that book well. I have taken a pilates class and found the instructor, although certified, lacked an effective teaching technique and sometimes changed the movements to her own adaptation, plus the instructor never provided a backgrounder on the technique. Let's just say I was missing the big picture. Brook's materials let me follow the true technique. Now I can do my pilates exercises at lunch in the gym without paying large fees to off-target instructors. This CD set is not for those of you who require a constant visual demonstration of the moves. This is for those who are interested in doing the exercises and knowing the moves without a DVD prompt."
4,Great cues but very basic exercises,"Siler gives fantastic instructions, and her workouts are filled with helpful cues. I love the CD format because you can bring it to the gym or on vacation. Unlike most other Pilates programs on video that combine instruction on each movement with the Pilates exercise session, this program moves at a pace fast enough to have a real workout. There are separate instructions on how to do the movement. The main criticism I have is that even the Intermediate session is very basic and includes only the exercises that Brooke Siler's paperback book describes as Basic. I hope she comes out with a more advanced CD."
5,Makes it easy,"I think that this kit made working out a pleasure. I found the CD easy to follow and educational. It improved not only my body- but my state of mind.I would suggest this program for all of you who hate to work out and ""forget""....Brooke's kit makes it FUN!!!"
1,TOO BAD,AD SAY NOTHING ABOUT FOR USE IN AUTO. IF THEYCAME WITH A (IR) INFERRED TRANSMITTER THEY WOULD WORKFINE I GUESS. BUT THEY DON'T. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVEA INFERRED UNIT FOR GET THIS ONE.BY THE WAY WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IR MEANT.
5,another addicting Rhino compilation,"Wholee god this is rock at its finest! If you enjoy one-hit-wonder songwriting, flawlessly catchy melodies or guitar-based pop, this comp is a MUST. For myself, it's still one of my prized CD possessions, and the first one I'm saving if my place goes up in flames.And what's more, if you're not singing along and air-guitaring to this baby in no time, Amazon.com will refund ALL YOUR MONEY! Right?.... guys?... right?I only had one minor complaint -- I also thought Cheap Trick's cut could have been better, but alas, there's just so many from which to choose."
3,Another Bette Davis Movie Video!,"ok.. this film is not very good... it is minor film in the career of Miss Bette Davis. BUT.. it is a fun film to view... too see how hard Miss Davis works to entertain her audience! Yes she overacts in this film... she has to... it storyline is bad...the direction is bad. See this film for the fun of it! You get to see her act with her then husband, Gary Merrill. Yes Miss Davis's character is a bad women... but nobody is as bad as Miss Davis when she is bad!"
2,Routine Thriller Recommended Only for Bette Fans,"I'm happy that this movie has finally made it to video--I'd wanted to see it for years. However, the movie sounds more interesting than it actually is, and it is purely a routine production based on a routine story. The English actors conduct themselves nicely, but we've seen it all a hundred times before. Gary Merrill is actually bad most of the time, and his character grows tiresome mighty fast. Bette is Bette, and if you like her, you'll want to see ANOTHER MAN'S POISON. Get a load of her mad laugh toward the end!Bubba"
1,what the hell,estan locos...o ese es el precio.....demasaido caro..para un film..poco conocido por bette...me parece un insulto y un robo..sldos
3,Worth seeing,"Bette Davis, so it's worth seeing. It was curiosity that lead me to purchase this a few years ago, mostly curiosity about the chemistry the film might show between Davis and Gary Merrill, and it is an interesting dynamic to watch.'Another Man's Poison,' however, is not exactly a lost treasure. It is no way on the level of 'All About Eve' but then, not a lot is.An irritating, old codger neighbor rather ruins the flow of the first half of the movie, you kind of wish Davis would just shoot him or something and get on with the rest of the film. Merrill is good. Davis, as almost always, shows a lot of range, though the ending is kind of a disappointment- even when she's over the top, I've come to expect quality and something new in every performance of hers. The final seconds in the film, while certainly over-the-top, seem a bit cutrate, in terms of her performance. I could be wrong.Glad to have it, nonetheless."
4,Awesome collection of his blues/rock years!!!,"What a great way to sum up a decade of Pat Travers on Mike Varney's Blues Bureau label. The first 8 tunes are studio tracks from his first 6 Blues Bureau releases (1992 -1997). The next 5 tunes are live tracks from his Polydor albums (1976 - 1983).Anybody ever seen Pat live knows there is little or no equal in his field. He rips it up like no one else can.If your looking to sample his Blues Bureau releases, this is a perfect place to start. You won't be disappointed.His releases since Best Of Blues Plus Live (1997) are also worth checking out.-Blues Tracks 2-Don't Feed The Alligators-PT Power Trio-Travers & Appice ""It Takes A Lot Of Balls""PT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!! :)"
5,even my son-in-law was fascinated by this book.,De Kooning was a personal friend growing up and I enjoyed this biography as did my non-art background son-in-law at thanksgiving.
5,I Wore This One Out,"This album is like a drug. It puts you in a euphoric trance. This album defines Lo-Fi. Every album Lou Barlow has had a hand in has gotten better and better. This one is classic, therefore One Part Lullaby is even more so. Buy them both."
2,Frustrating - Wasted Talent,"A disappointment, especially compared to the superb One Part Lullaby. Thankfully, they have moved on to make better music."
1,Fell Apart,The cover fell apart from being outside after about two months. Do not waste your money! I would pay the extra $6 for the heavy duty version.
5,Great grill cover,"Sure wish we would have bought this for our new Ducane grill last year, so it could have protected it all winter, too. We used previous grill cover and got by (since it was in garage all winter), but it still got dirty. This cover is top quality vinyl - heavy but does not weigh too much to handle. I love that it covers it all the way down so it protests the open area with the gas bottle, too. The velcro straps will be great to snug down the cover when outside. Don't ""get by"" like we did, buy one to protect your Ducane grill."
4,GOOD PRODUCT...GOOD RETAILER!,Product as advertised. COVER FITS VERY SNUG MAKING IT A LITTLE TOUGH TO PUT ON. QUALITY IS VERY GOOD. Fast shipping.
4,Fits Like a Glove,I am really satisfied with this cover so far. It fits like a glove and gives the patio a nice classy look when we are not grilling.
5,Grill cover,"This is a great cover. It is heavy duty, and look like it will last a long time. It fits my grill perfect!"
5,Nice job!,Great price designed exclusively for my grille and received it almost overnight at no charge. I was very impressed. Nice job!
1,Infinity grill covet,"This product is not an original.The materials are cheap,Weber makes quality products,and this is a generic.I'm very dissatisfied .This is a first for me.You always had been reliable.Gretchen Hile"
2,1976 F100 Steering Coupling,"The part provided did not fit a 1976 F100, therefore, it was usless for the required task. It was about 1/2 an inch smaller in diameter."
2,not good,This part did not fit my 88 4.9 Ford right. I made it work. I am buying one from Bronco Graveyard.
