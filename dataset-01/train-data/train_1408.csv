2,gerber light,"OK,so Ive been carrying my light now for about a week. its about the size of a Bic lighter so the compact size i give 5 stars but the illumination is crap....I'm very disappointed. i keep it on me but I'd be happier with a brighter beam. other than that for the money i recommend it"
4,"Works as advertised, flexible fit, reasonable price",This item is easy to install on your existing pegboard and comfortably holds a variety of cordless drills or other tools. It's nice to have the drill so close at hand and not have to leave it on a bench or table.
3,It's OK,"I thought that a pegboard would be awesome to have and I am now just so so on the idea. This tool holds my drill loosely, it does the job but it certainly isn't awe inspiring lol"
2,"Great Item, Costly shipping","I've used these at home and they are great. However, my local Home Depot was out of stock so I looked online for the 4 I needed. Price here was only a few cents more, but the shipping for 4 of these hooks through this seller was $24! For that price I can wait until Home Depot stocks it again."
2,"Great styling, but so - so performance","I purchased this colander because my old one that I've had for 15 years was getting a little tired. I love the styling of this new colander, but it has some flaws. The elongated holes on the bottom allow small pasta to slip through, and the paint chips easily. It is also NOT dishwasher safe, and even though I have never put it in the dishwasher the paint still chips. I've only had this one a few months and it's looking older than my old one.:("
1,Don't Go West Young Man!,"This game was purchased for a lover of games about the west, military, etc. This game was a WASTE of money. It was dull, boring, and just not a good game. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Useless within 2 months : Revel CCM101,"Completely agree with Phil. The plastic parts where the top pot and the base meet, have worn out within 2 months. There is no plastic anymore. And the chopper stands useless. What I am having is Revel-CCM101 model. Don't have any clue where I can get spare parts for it, or get it repaired. Any suggestions are welcome."
1,Completely inadequate design,"At first sight, the basic design of this grinder appears sound, and at 280W it's got plenty of power. It handles spice-grinding tasks with ease, although extremely noisily. (It shrieks like a banshee. Consider buying some earplugs.)Unfortunately, you shouldn't expect it to do so more than about half a dozen times, maybe a dozen if you never grind more than about a tablespoon of spices at a time, because that's how long it takes the Revel grinder to either melt its nylon drive gear or wear through the bottom of its grind bowl. The blade mounting is simply dry plastic parts clamped together and spinning at high speed with no lubrication whatsoever. Crude doesn't begin to describe it - this grinder could almost have been intentionally designed to self-destruct, and it does so, quickly.If you're shopping for a spice grinder and intend to use it, I recommend ... almost anything but this one."
1,Waste of money and time,This grinder lasted all of three pulses and then the plastic gear melted.I read another review stating this and didn't head it... it's true.Don't buy this hunk of junk!
2,Great While It Lasts...,"I've used several of these grinders over the past 5 years. Several because they break frequently. I continue to use them because for Indian cooking (where you need to make garlic paste and dry spice grind) it's the only option. When it works, it works fairly well. It will not grind spices into a super fine powder, only a medium fine consistency. There are no replacement parts. To elongate use, only hand wash and never run the motor for longer than a minute."
4,Good luck with older versions,"I have one of these grinders that I have used a few times a week for more than 10 years. At the time it was possible to buy replacement bowls for much less than the cost of the whole grinder, and I do have a spare. I did have one bowl where the blade became ""stripped"" from the plastic turning nut on the bottom a few years ago, after many years of service, and I did throw that one away.I have always washed the bowls in the top rack of my diswasher (yes, I do use heated dry) and I've never had a problem with that.The company that produced these grinders went out of business a few years ago and as I recall the product became unavailable. It is now once available again, but I do not know how the quality of the current product (whomever is making it) compares with what I bought many years ago."
5,Best Pool Lounger Ever,This is the best pool lounger ever. I love it. I can catch the suns rays with lots of room to float around in my pool.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I ordered 2 of these collars recently. one is almost 2"" smaller than the other although they are ""one size"" fits all. THEY DO NOT BREAK AWAY when snagged. I like the thinness, but it could kill your cat!"
1,Do Not Buy This!,This product is dangerous for your animal! It is not a safety collar! Luckily I was home when my cat got caught and I was able to cut it off.
2,Ok,"I purchased this collar for my cats thinking that it would be thinner than the 3/8"" collars. My Cat's necks were rather small and by the time I adjusted the collar and the cords overlapped it was the same width as the other collars. I did not like the metal clamps used to adjust the collar and the breakaway part was so difficult to get apart I am not confidant that the collar would come off if my cat were to get caught on something. I have purchased the New Earth Breakaway collars and much prefer them to this product."
1,Don't buy it.,When I purchased this product I thought will look nice on my cat but its not . I can't wear my cat bad product. I've a sphynx cat and her skin very sensitive to an quality product.
1,Fibers can become separated an dangerous,"I was thrilled to find a collar that would not take the fur of my kittie's neck. Unfortunately, I found my cat with her claw caught in the fiber of the collar. It did not breakaway and she could not free herself. I'm glad I was home at the time. Too bad."
3,Does the Job - Design Need Work,"After reading the reviews, I decided to give these collars a try. I found the review by M. Raymer ""Crazy Cat Lady"" especially helpful. The clasp on the 4 collars I got seemed to be just the right strength. One cat has gotten out of the collar once (collar broke away just as it should), but hasn't done it since. I find the clasp opens best for humans if you apply a slight upward pressure with your thumb, not just trying to pull it apart.I agree that the collars loosen up too easily. Per M. Raymer's recommendation, I pulled out the pliers and squeezed the sliding metal connectors to tighten them up once they were adjusted to my cat. I think these connectors need some real work - they move too easily, are cumbersome compared to the rest of the collar, and the edges are too sharp.All in all the best alternative I've found, but it still needs work!"
1,Dont like.,This collar was great in theory but really sucked. My cat kept chewing on it. After a day it looked all snagged up. And then he got his mouth caught under it and was stuck like that until I noticed. Seems unsafe. Why didn't the safety snap work?
5,A Wonderful Touchstone and Resource,"As a wanna-be homeschooler/unschooler with children in a fairly traditional school, I find myself continually returning to this book to re-center myself and to put my role in my sons' education back into the right perspective. It's very accessible and a wonderful compilation of ideas set forth by homeschooling advocates from John Holt on. The suggestions for enhancing school curriculum at home are excellent and have served our family well."
5,Very Fast Performance & Excellent Price,This is the current top-rated consumer NAS on the market according to CNet. Network performance is excellent and the web-base admin tools are easy to use and intuitive. I purchased this for $250 from Amazon with the usual free shipping. I would highly recommend this product for the average consumer that wants to run applications from or back up to a NAS device.
3,"Shaky start, but okay now?","During setup, my MV2020 hung up while doing a firmware upgrade, and then would no longer boot up. After a long period of dealing with phone support, they mailed me a new HDD. Cost me a trip to FedEx and a lot of time, but did not cure the problem. After another long phone support session, they sent me a new chassis. After moving the HDD into this unit, it would boot up, but now had a different problem with the HDD. After talking with phone support yet again, they sent me another HDD. This one worked, and I have finally been able to use my unit. Nearly all of this hassle could have been avoided had they just sent me another unit as I requested in the first phone call.Anyway, after way too much time talking on the phone and shipping components back and forth, my MV2020 now works. Needless to say, I am a bit concerned about trusting it. Time will tell."
2,Cannot Upgrade to Higher Capacities,"I was thinking of upgrading the unit by placing 750GB drives in both bays. Apparently, the 64MB RAM that HP uses limits the total capacity to 1.2TB or thereabouts. It is frustrating that HP would try to save on parts that would have cost them less than than a few dollars. This means that in a RAID1 configuration, you cannot use more than 500GB of total storage.If you have no plans to go to higher storage in the future, this seems like a good product. There is a Yahoo group with active discussion that can help sort out various issues.But my own experience has been that my storage needs keep doubling every two years. I am now going to buy a DNS323 from D-Link (although I have had only mixed results from D-link in the last several years)."
1,HP Media Vault is UNRELIABLE,My HP Media Vault has been unreliable from day one. For starters the drive that shipped with my unit had areas of corruption.The warranty is for only 90 days. That's right. HP want you to use this product to backup your most valuable files. And the quality of the unit is so high they back it for a whole 90 days. Way to stand behind your product HP!!Remember that if you have a wireless network protected by WEP security you need to run this in user mode or give access to your files to your neighbors or anyone riding by in a car with a laptop. Unfortunately user mode is buggy and will lock you out of the vault or force you to reset and reconfigure on a fairly frequent basis.The HP Media Vault is buggy and unreliable. So is the company that makes it.
2,Abysmal performance,"I've had my MV2020 for about 6 months. It was a breeze to set up and worked well for scheduled backups. I recently decided to trust as a primary source for my family photos as I'm rebuilding the PC on which the reside. I loaded 45 new photos (103MB) onto my hard drive, uploaded them to Kodak. The internet upload to Kodak took under two minutes, it took over 15 minutes to move the same photos to the media vault and my PC and home network were heavily impacted for several minutes beyond that.Bottom line, it's great for scheduled back ups, but terrible as a networked storage."
1,Item is super crap and slow,Wish i never wasted my money on it. Disks to copy say 1gb file took over 1hr.. apparently this is the normal speed
1,Beware of power bumps -- data difficult to recover,"After a power bump the MV2020 which we'd had for 3 years died. Called a tech -- he could not recover the data! Called HP, and they can't do it either. This is a backup device that has no backup the one time you need it -- when something goes wrong.Loved it until that power bump, but a backup device that fails in a power bump isn't worth much."
2,Mine Failed - Out of Warranty,"Loyal HP customer no more.While I love this device's features and ease of use, mine failed just out of warranty. Just like my dv9000 laptops (known manufacturing defect - see dv9000 overheating). The once vaunted HP quality is gone. I'd think twice before purchasing an HP product. They seem to self destruct just out of warranty."
5,Best Network Attached Storage on the Market for Home Networks,"I really read lots of reviews on newegg, Amazon, Tiger-Direct, etc. There is alot of NAS out there so there is much to choose from. I know that I paid a little more for this solution than lets say the Buffalo Linkstation; but I think I made the best choice. Setup is easy; the software worked right without alot of tinkering; by wife and I have automatic backup of all important files on our laptpos without manually keying anything. And to boot, if you go to one of the pages of their tech people, you can access your files over the internet. It takes a little work, but I am able to do it. That makes this a great purchase...backup storage for three computers, 1.2TB of storage, and access from remote locations."
2,greatly disappointed,"there are perhaps 2-3 good songs on this CD, and two of them I heard on pandora, so I was hoping this would be a solid cd, its not..."
4,"A good alternative to the ""official strategy guide.""","The unofficial strategy guide to Starcraft is in my opinion an average guide to playing multyplayer games online. I havn't read the official one by Prima, but I have heard that this one is better. It has chapters devoted to each race and it lists the stats of each character, which is very helpful. The only problem I had was that the multyplayer map pictures were hand drawn and not the real computer generated maps. But besides that it was a pretty decent strategy guide, and it's cheaper than the official one."
3,Where have all the Bluebirds gone?,"There are dozens of great, great Fats Waller sides for Bluebird out there somewhere, but it seems they are oh so out of print. This is one disc of fine music, but Fats is so much more than this. What jazz fans want is not yet another single disc smattering compilation of Fats Waller. What we want is access to all those great Bluebird records from the 30's (his best years) on CD. Let's hope RCA will stop sitting on them."
3,"When it works, it's alright","First, it didn't install on my desktop (bad media). The replacement installed fine on my laptop but wouldn't run on the 128mb video card because it was part of my motherboard (a 200-series ATI system). I finally got it back on my desktop, but each section starts with a sound problem which I've had no luck troubleshooting. When it's past that problem the graphics and sound are fine, and the game is a solid FPS with an above-average story considering the focus on graphics. Just make sure you keep the recipt and check the graphics requirements."
1,Careful With This Game,"I bought this since I was a die hard fan of the previous Quake game. Q4 was disappointing. My system exceeded the minimum requirements and still it did not play smoothly, despite tweaking all the video/audio options. Loading times are excrutiating as well. I don't think people should buy games and then have to manipulate their systems to get even the basic requirements out of the game. The developers need to go back to the drawing board on this one. A complete disappointment."
2,disappointed.,"i remember the good old days of doom 1 and how fun that was.. and then quake 1 came along and was even more fun! it was great. anyway, i enjoyed the doom 3 demo except for the whole DARKNESS thing... i don't want to deal with that. so i figured maybe quake 4 would be as good as doom 3 but without having to whip out a flashlight every second and shoot at things i can't see. unfortunately, that isn't the case. quake 4 is just a pretty mediocre FPS.. i'd still rather play it than that crappy FPS prey.. but it's not as fun as, say, far cry or max payne. that's about all i can say really, it's just not that good. i didn't really care for the multiplayer either. if you really want a good multiplayer, play half-life 2's. people never talk about it but it's fun."
1,Loading problems,"When I buy a piece of software, I expect it to run out of the box because I have a decent system. This took forever to load up on four discs and then blanks out when I start it up. I suppose there is a fix somewhere out there on the web, and I'll spend a few hours trying to get it figured out, but for the price, this is not to be forgiven no matter how dandy it might turn out to be (read the other reviews). If I'd saved my receipt (doh!), I'd just take it back for something else. Now I'm stuck."
4,Quake 4,"Awsome 3d shooter, better first player than Quake 2, or as good (remember back then). I wish online play was faster, my P4 2.2Ghz with 2gb memory and 128mb ATI DirectX 9 video card can't handle it. Other than that I am surprised it runs 1player smooth enough. You will like the different types of gameplay and spaceships you aboard. I am only about 5 levels deep into the game. I hope I play it throughout how much I plan to take advantage (milk) my laptop for either way. My laptop runs Everquest 2 super fast, that is a long time I plan to take advantage of the current ""tier"" of DirectX9. I will build a computer afterwards. Buy it! Quake quake quake! What else."
4,A Fun Game But...,"I miss the Arena style Quake. I love competing on all the different levels offered in the Q3 Arena game. Good graphics, but a little easy...just point shoot and you advance."
2,A waste.............,"Awhile back, I wrote a not so good review of Halo (one) and have changed my mind. I simply needed a better computer and video card. So now I've had that for a year or so and have been loving Halo CE. I figured I would try another shooter and bought Quake 4. Big disapointment, to me. Just for the record, I'm not a fan of artificially fast movements, whether it be racing games or shooters. And in this game, well...it seems everything is fast and dark. Especially fast in the multiplayer environment. It's just no fun to when everything happens so fast you don't have time to appreciate if there even are cool looking environments in which to play...unlike in, I believe Quake 3, which I liked.In single player mode, I actually thought I absentmindedly bought a second copy of Doom....same old look....dark corridors inside a space ship. Nothing interesting.Next time I'll check other reviews and especially the screen captures."
2,Quake 4.........,"No co-op play unless you download a large third party add-on. I kept falling through the graphics and when I would try to move, the graphics which were now overhead moved the other way while I remained stationary on a pile of sand. Kind of a unique experience which I fooled around with for awhile. Possibly a graphics upgrade would correct that but the game's not worth it to me. Game play is nothing like the older Quake games. We went back to UT2004."
4,Great game,"I was very impressed with Quake 4. I believe its made by the same folks who created Doom 3 -- which was extremely disappointing: if I had to walk down one more lousy hallway and go figure -- I can shoot AND use the flashlight in this game!!! This is the game that Doom should have been. Graphics are great. AI is great - the enemy ducks and dives for cover. Also, lots of diversity -- inside, outside, driving, etc. I have played just about every FPS and I would rank this way, way up there. Right behind Half Life 2 (greatest game ever), and on par with Far Cry."
4,My kind of game,"Personally I like FPS like this. I just want straightforward no frills gameplay to blow off steam and Q4 fills the bill. Looks very similar to Doom 3 with more color and better lighting. Not as compelling as HL2, and a little overpriced. I'm only a third of the way into it, but I've had no glitches. I still play Q2 even though it's dated. If you liked Q2 you'll like this. Never got into Q3-arena type stuff bores me."
1,not worthy of the quake name,"this game like many recent titles greatly improves in the grapics arena while making gameplay more acessible and ""dynamic"", too bad they forgot what ppl loved about the prevoius game. why waste money to repeatedly buy new computer hardware for games like this? answer: don't!"
1,Not one single reflection.,zpconn obviously can not read. Cpt_Kirk's review states clearly what an API is at the start of the review and then talks about the game engine after. Would you buy an OpenGL card based on current OpenGL games? No. Why doesn't Valve support OpenGL? The answer is obvious if you have played Quake 4. Everyone really has the right to see this game before they buy it because it does not look anything like the screenshots which in themselves are questionable. Really see Quake 4 before you buy it and be careful of viewing screen art that was released a year and a half ago and is not the finished product. Die hard Quake fans will love anything which slaps Quake on the cover. Who are Raven software? Where are the reflections? What game can show off OpenGL? Not Quake 4. Is there any? Doom 3 in the dark. That is it.
1,Innovation is DEAD at ID Software,"ID was the creator of the FPS genre with Wolfenstein and the original DOOM. After DOOM there was DOOM II, then Quake, etc, etc. John Carmack is a terncho-genius and has pushed technology developers to the edge to support ever-better looking gaming expeirences. And then it ends like this. Pressing out tripe dressed in dazzling graphics. I got bored with DOOM3 1/3 of the way in. No story or a lame attempt haven't played since. Same dark narrow passages, same dingy boring design, blah, blah, blah. ID turned into their worst nightmare...potential genius drowned in corporate greed.Buy Half Life 2 or F.E.A.R."
2,get UT instead,"Q4 is sophisiticated and detailed enough, however, as far as game play goes -- it's rather mundane. the graphics are all dark, creating a cozy feel of playing in one's unlit closet, and the movement is rather lame and limited. having played UT2004, i cannot understand why any one would prefer Q4 save n00bs. there is some eye candy to this game, but, altogether, this game is quite a bad pretext to sup up one's pc. just wait for UT2007 to come out and save your money."
4,The 2nd spectacle of next genration fps,"If only these guys would try harder at making an actual game, and less at perfecting their incredible game engines, they would undoutedly use these amazing creations to their fuller potential. Much like it's cousin Doom, Quake 4 offers players immersion into alien worlds like none ever seen. There are indeed some levels that look a little too much like some of the visuals found in Doom, but eventually the overall differences in level design far surpass the lack of variety that plauged the first true mind blowing fps. The gameplay however, has not really taken any evolutionary step along with the graphics, which is generally what leaves most gamers cold. Let us hope that these companies will continue to produce some of the most amazing visuals on screen, but discontinue to except those visuals make up for a lack of engaging gameplay."
1,Just a Quake 3 update,"This game is graphically stunning. The textures are beautiful; the backgrounds are amazing; the fire and explosions are realistic. BUT - the gameplay is horrible. If you are a Quake 3 fan, you'll love this game because it is the exact same gameplay as that old title. But is it worth the price to essentially just buy a graphical game update? No way. On top of that, the single player mode is just plain bad. It is contrived and inflexible, leading you through the levels like you're on a leash. If you want a good single player game (with an outstanding online multiplayer game as well) I suggest Half-Life 2.Wait until this drops to the $20 range and then it might be worth it."
1,Serious Problems Reported with Quake4,"Think real hard before you buy Quake4 for PC. It's all over the web: There is a serious LAG time for tons of users, even those with good systems. Your mouse cursor is faster than the game. A few claim to have the solutions to it, usually involving playing it on the lowest qualities and using a cheapo mouse or low hz mouse settings. These ""solutions"" don't work for everyone, including me. Some reported bad problems with the sound. I had no problems with that before the lag set in. The official sites are no help. I had occasional problems with lag for the first levels. Tweaking the settings seemed to cure it, but when I got well into the level with the hovertank it became unplayable. The video took as much 5 to 10 seconds to catch up with the mouse. My computer handles Halo, Doom3, and UT 2004 with no problem. Quake4 on the other hand ... I can't believe they let it out like this."
5,Sweet and Awesome,"This game is one of the games that started it all ! Now all the games available today are trying and succeeding to jump on the billionaire bandwagon. Thanks because my nephew stole disc # 1 of my 1st purchase @ $59.99, thinking he would get the whole game,"
5,A must Buy game for Any FPS Fan,When i first bought this game i though i would be playing a doom clone with a quake story. I was wrong this game is great the story draws you in and the graphics and sound make and atmosphere that sucks you in and makes you believe you really are a marine invading the Strogg homeworld fighting for humanity. This game is a must buy for any FPS fan and if I can not wait to see what that got in store for Quake Wars:enemy Territory.
4,"a doom type game, good playability","story, graphics and movement are all good. Enemies are a bit odd but pretty good considering the storyline. a fps with decent weapons. Has a good replay value. Blowing away the makron is best part."
3,Quake Lives,"The last version I played of Quake before this was Quake Arena, which I liked, however I've always been a fan of FPS games so I looked forward to playing Quake 4 after trying out the demo.The graphics are killer and the AI seems to be very reactive. There are some very immersive levels and the play is fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping. However, there are a few things that I didn't like about it.1. The gameplay does not change much. Most of the levels are dark interior rooms with horrific, lumbering, enemies coming in predictable waves ala Doom.2. It would have been nice to have more vehicle based missions. There was entirely too much running around waiting for some ornately grotesque creature to jump out of the darkness and not enough ""mission-based"" levels.Overall, the game was worth the money, but there was room for improvement."
4,"Great SP, not great MP","I'm a Quake addict from the Wolfenstein era. Great Single player. Not as scary or biting your nails type of intensity. Doom III is, I think better for that. However, I'm disappointed in the multiplayer. It seems like Quake 3.2. Same maps. Nothing really new. You would seem like your playing the third of the series. Graphics are not like the SP. I wish. They're more like III. I was very disappointed. They didn't even put any effort to get any new maps. Forget about vehicles. I thought I was gonna ride a mech style vehicle. Wasn't worth 60 bucks. Wait until it's 30. In the meantime, the best and most fun MP game I've ever played is Call of Duty United Offensive. Try it. It'll get even cheaper when version 2 comes out next week."
3,Quake 4,"This could have been a GREAT game, but unfortunately it is not. The best thing about the game is the graphics. On the otherhand the story is mediocre, and the game has no replay value. I tried the Multiplayer, but there's really nothing new there either. The good is -like I said ealier- the graphics. Also I like the weapons upgrade, but thats nothing new. I like when your with a team and thought that your teamates did a much better job than most games attempt to do, and they also can take alot of damage. It is a decent FPS but just could have been so much better."
1,Loading problems part II,"I bought this game one day after receiving my new Alienware computer. Aurora 7500 with AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor, 1 Gig RAM, ATI Radeon 1800XT video card with 528mb RAM, XP Professional. After I loaded the game and attempted to start it my computer locked HARD, wouldn't even reboot. I tried uninstalling and re-installing with same problem. Contacted Activision and they sent instructions to ""update"" my drivers, funny for a computer that was just built. Anyway, I followed their instructions and the results were worse, now I had NO drivers and I had to contact Alienware to get my system running again. I sent Activision an e-mail stating what had happened and all they said is ""you didn't follow the directions"". Well, I followed every step and it made things worse. Fortunately, I did save my receipt and the game is going back. Junk."
4,Very Satisfied,I thought this was a very good performance of some of Tanya's greatest hits though not all of them.
5,Brilliant !,This book is a must for anyone interested in spiritual tradition. It shows that Islam Suffis have come to conclusions similar to those in famous Taoist Yoga and in the Kabbalah. Please read the book more than once - it deserves it !
2,Disappointing,"I am typically a MWS fanatic. However, this CD is just... lackluster. None of the songs really grab you like ""A Place in This World"", or ""This is Your Time"". Even MWS's bread and butter piano ballads seem forced. It is as if he had to crank out a cd to fulfill a studio contract obligation.That said, the messages in the songs are dead on. Smith never has pulled punches and the message is convicting."
3,Not outstanding,"Listen to Freedom, then listen to this CD - is this the same person? Or should I say, same producers? I think the producers let Smittie down on this one. The highlights of the CD are: ""Live Forever"", a very powerful ballad, ""Human Spark"", reminds me of the old Michael. ""All I want"" is another strong one. But overall this is not his best outing."
2,WHERES THE MICHAEL I KNOW AND LOVE?,"I have followed michael since his very first album and in these years now, this is the first album that has left me thinking -""whats up with this?"" The song healing rain is a very nice song and a couple others cought my ear, but overall i felt like this cd wasn't worth my money. I also didn't think there were enough songs on this cd. This is the first cd ever that i have to say i haven't cared for from michael. Its not that it stinks or anything like that, but this seems more like something coming from someone new to the scene or like a first album attempt at best. Sorry, i can't honestly recommend this one."
2,Uninspired and Empty,"Slick and clean production, as is typical for a Michael W. Smith album, but ulimately most of the songs fall flat and seem uninspired and empty. Of course, Michael with sell plenty of copies because his face is on the cover. There just seems to be nothing of lasting value to these songs and I'm wondering if Michael will ever get it right. He ""sings"" as if he is doubtful he can make the next note. I've listened to album after album of Michael, and I've liked some of the songs, but at least half of them have sounded unfinished or like they were rushed in order to meet a deadline commitment. Michael could possibly be one of the most over-rated CCM artists of our time. Seems like he never found that ""Missing Person."" I admire his personal life and commitment to great causes, but I continue to be baffled by his popularity as an artist."
3,"Well, honestly.....","Very simply, as a 24 year old longtime fan of Michael W Smith's music, this CD was a little disappointing. It just didn't really lift me up in any way. That's all........"
5,Smitty's Music Just Keeps Getting Better and Better!!!,"Just when I thought he can't top his last album, he does it again! I absolutely love this album and would recommend it to anyone who loves Contemporary Christian music. It's hard to say which songs are my favorite because I love them all.A MUST HAVE for any Smitty fan out there!"
3,ok,It was an enjoyable movie but just not as good as the previous mummy movies of this series. Great special effects
3,mummy,liked it. great cgi. good acting. story a little ridiculous but they pulled it off. dont like replacement leading lady. no chemistry or believability.
5,as suspenseful as the first one,this is a really good movie Imhotep is not in this movie though. in this movie they are not in Egypt but china. just what you expect from the series full of action.
1,No Audio Ouput From Blu-ray Version,"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"What more can I add that many have said previously. The script was really bad, the choice of Evi, previously played by Rachel Weisz (and sorely missing), was atrocious. There was almost no chemistry amongst the cast this time around, as if they knew this was a stinker and they were just going through the motions. Another thing, why 7 years between The Mummy Returns and this one? If there is usually such a long time lag in a series, the interest in the series has usually faded or gone away altogether. Typical Hollywood, completely clueless."
2,Just wasn't good enough,"I loved the first two films, but was hesitant about this one when Rachael didn't return as Evie - and my gut feeling was right.The storyline starts good, but it doesn't take much to see through what each character's ""secret"" is and it becomes too predictable. John Hanna wasn't in the film enough to give it the right touch, instead relying on the newcomer Luke - who plays his role well but...The first two movies had great scripts - this movie relied way too much on special effects and the name brand. Watched it once - I won't bother again."
2,Time for the mummy to die,"Rick and Evy O'Connell (Brendan Fraser & Maria Bello) go back into action against mummies when their adult son (Luke Ford) inadvertently awakens an ancient Chinese warlord (Jet Li) who is still bent on conquering the world.I enjoyed the earliest parts of this film most. The scenes showing the O'Connells chafing under the boredom of their sedate, wealthy lifestyle are quite humorous. Once the action gets under way, it's just a lot of been-there-done-that. Many of the action sequences are nearly incomprehensible due to chaotic, frenetic editing."
1,...and the 3rd movie kills the franchise,"Its obvious there weren't many ideas left to keep the Mummy franchise going but the third installment pretty much ruined any idea of it ever coming back. Sure the movie has lots of action but little substance and no soul. Fast pacing spliced together with forced romance and poor comedy barely hold this movie together.It could have been done well and sent the series out with a bang but with Hollywood focusing on the ""under 13 crowd"", this movie puts the lid on the coffin with no interest in raising the series from the dead."
1,Doom of the Mummy,"Very disappointed in this installment. Rachael Weisz was truly missed! The whole time I was watching it seemed I was waiting for something new and differant, but it didn't happen. Same story line and it got old quick."
2,the mummy,I found this mummy to lack the fun and excitement that the other two movies had. I was expecting more.The mummy chasers are back with their son. This time a Dragon Emperor is out of his tomb and trying to take over the world.
2,Waste of film,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I should of been looking forward to a denist visit and I would of enjoyed that better. Rent it, borrow it but don't waste your money buying it."
3,Something Missing,"This is no where near as good as the first two. That has to be said. But it's not so bad as to be unwatchable.The move from Egypt to China is something I don't think the movie could overcome, but it was different and it was nice to see another country's legends and mythology on screen.The points where it was lacking, and there are a few, is that the chemistry in the movie is completely lacking like in the first two. The replacement wife and Fraser just don't seem to click. Try as they might it just never seems to happen. This time around Fraser and the guy who plays Jonathan just seem like they just met and are still feeling each other out. This movie doesn't have the same zing to it as the others either. I felt Jet Li was actually under used. It's like they just wanted him for his martial arts and that's it.I just don't know what happened. It's no awful, but it's no where as fun as the first two. I hope they don't try for a fourth."
2,Over the hill,This third edition of the Mummy is pushing a good idea too far. Let us all hope that this puts an end to the series.
3,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,"This was a gift and they are pleased with it and happy to complete their Mummy collection, they feel the first ones were better, but is still entertaining."
1,I was disappointed,"I first must admit that I loved the first Mummy movie, the second Mummy movie, and the Scorpion King. I was very excited when I heard this movie was coming and looked forward to seeing it. However, I did not like the ""new"" Evy, I enjoy when the same actors play in all the movies. She just didn't do Evy justice. The son was a bit of a joke as well. This was not one of Jet Li's better movies. I enjoyed War and the One, to name a couple, but not here. The movie was action from the get go, which isn't bad, but it just wasn't interesting like the first 3. I purchased this movie counting on it being as good as the others. My advice, don't even bother watching this movie, let alone buying it."
4,Third Time is a Charm,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (Two Disc Deluxe Edition)I found this version different, but just as exciting as the other two. It still had humor, family values, mixed in with breath taking action and intrigue Maybe the other viewers are not as young at heart. My grandchildren enjoyed it too.Joy Crumpley"
4,A solid entry in the mummy series,"The mummy part 3 is a solid entry in the franchise which has all elements u want to see from this genre like suspense, action, super effects and even laughter.The only thing which was wrong was MRS.BELLO. They should have the former fraser's wife and personally i count this movie as a mummy movie which i enjoyed as much as i enjoyed the first and the second mummy movies. The movie which I DON'T COUNT AS A MUMMY MOVIE IS THE AUFUL SPIN OF FLICK CALLED...THE SCORPION S H IT...(Ooops i meant king)."
4,great escapism,"OK the above reviewers are smoking crack if they think that mummy 2 is better,this has a new mummy played very well by jet li,amazing as always,great humour,neat scene with the snow men in the mountains,maria bello is great as the new evie,her accent spot on,am looking forward to the bluray release,Rob Cohen does a great job directing this one,look forward to morej"
3,"You know, this movie isn't as all that terrible as nearly everyone is saying","I just recently picked up ""The Mummy"" Trilogy on Blu-Ray. I barely remember the first two films but I do remember that I thought that they were pretty good. And after reading all those negative reviews of the third film, this ""Tomb of The Dragon Emperor"", I decided to watch it first before I watch the more popular two.And, I'd have to say that it's not so terrible. As it's own film, it's just as good as any Indiana Jones film, in fact, I think this one film is better than Indiana Jone's Last Crusade and especially the last Indiana Jones film of ""Kingdom of The Crystal Skull"" since this theme seems to be rather similar.So, I'm glad I watched this episode of ""The Mummy"" first, because I haven't allowed my opinion to be tainted by expecting a plausible extension of the appeal of the first two. I'll wait a week or so, then I'll watch the first two with unperceived, unbiased, un-predetermined, expectations."
4,Nice Mummy Movie,"Was please with my purchase... Movie was ok, not really the best. Loved that I got all 3 types for one price and paid much less on Amazon then in the stores."
1,Horrible New Cast,"The main character's wife is a different character, either is the son. It is horribly done and the replacements look nothing like the originals. The story line and the events that happen in the movie were so cheezy I left before the movie was even over."
1,orrendo,"Gesù, non è possibile dare zero quindi mi tocca mettere una stella ma un film così brutto non l'ho mai visto! e pensare che è pure preso in considerazione per gli oscar nella sezione effetti speciali! spero sia uno scherzo altrimenti si sono bevuti tutti il cervello.............."
2,The creative energy of this series has run out,"The acting and production values are okay, but the screewriting is awful. This story just is not interesting. It's time to bring this series to an end. This latest episode is nowhere near its predecessors in quality."
2,They should have never replace the wife,"The wife being replaced by a new actress probably was the key to why the movie was so poorly done. There was no chemistry whatsoever between her and the main character. Jet Li's part was too short, they could have developed his role a bit more, similar to the first 2 mummys."
5,great movie!,This is the latest movie in this series and although they don't have the same actress playing the wife it's still a really good movie. A lot more action and less gore than the other Mummy movies.
4,Good Movie. Nice way to say goodbye.,"This was a good movie. It does the franchise justice, but hopefully the last one. The second one is still the best. This has great special effects,but the story is a little weak. Still a must buy to complete the collection."
3,PaddyCakes,"Ok I'll confess I only bought this because Michelle Yeoh was in it. Unfortunately it's only a supporting role so don't buy it just because of her. If you like the Mummy franchise it's got all the good stuff, plot, action, and romance you're used to seeing in previous Mummies. Plus the the added additon of the fabulous Jet Li in a villian role. Great movie."
2,I can think of better things to do...,"This one simply rides on the other two- BADLY. We can all think of better uses for our time!! In a nutshell- ACK. Best part was the Yeti's- they really did not fit, but they were amusing."
2,bad!,very bad the story sucked and the dialog blew. I liked the other mummy movies but this one was just horrible
2,Terrible and unnecessary,"The Bottom Line:It's not like the first two Mummy films were great films, but the cast exuded low-key charm and the adventures were fun enough; in the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, by contrast, the cast (conspicuously missing Rachael Weisz) goes through the emotions of the ridiculous screenplay while third-rate CGI dominates the back of the screen and everyone watching the film wonders why they even bothered."
3,ghost stories,Fun to watch. Not as good as the first one. equal to the second one whichmakes it one of the better flicks of this nature.
3,Good action...another mummy?,"Good action in the flick. Not a real drop your money at the box office type movie, but all in all it doesn't disappoint."
4,Leo's review on Mummy,"This movie is good as I expected. Brenden and Jet both are great action-bound actors (of course with special effects). Michelle again had the chance to show her martial art skills. Her screen-daughter was a new actress (to me), but she was OK. Brenden's screen-son was also a good supporting actor (the two somehow had similar characters). Some of the scenes shot in China were very elegant (assume they were shot in China).The only thing I don't like is the widescreen version which cut my screen vertical height into half. May be I should have bought the regular screen version if there is one."
1,Way to kill a good thing,Bad script bad actingI had to stop half way through to get rid of the mental pain.
2,Know when to say when,"Like a friend who's had almost too much to drink, someone should have cut off the director before this film was made. Starving people all around the world could have been fed on the money it took to make this drivel. When Rachel Weisz turned down the role that should have been the end of it, but no... they just kept right on dragging themselves deeper into the pit of insanity by recasting the role with a new actress who lacks all of the charm - no pretending Evy didn't live or stayed home this time. We aren't idiots. The film makers, on the other hand, evidently are. The first two movies were great fun. We prefer to pretend this third doesn't even exist. It will never be a part of our collection. We would rather pay more money per film to own only the first two on blu-ray than to pay less per film to get the box set of three (though if the box set offered the Scorpion King and the first two Mummy movies we'd be ok with that, as an earlier DVD box set release did)."
1,"Boring, idiotic. Ruins a terrific series.",Really enjoyed the first two mummy movies in the series. Looked for this one and found it in the young adult section of my local library. Wondered why it was there until I watched it. The script doesn't bear much scrutiny. Very disappointing. I guess they probably won't do another sequel now because this one was so awful. A pity.
3,Disappointment to a great series...,"I had been a huge fan of the Mummy Series. I loved the action and adventure that they held in each movie. The 1st movie was amazing and I also loved the 2nd one because of the family feel to the movie as they included their son. In this movie, I was really dissappointed. The acting was ok but I wish they would have gotten the original Evey (Rachel Weisz). The movie seemed really off without her. Overall though the movie did NOT live up the 1st 2 movies standards. Reallly disappointed especially since I am a huge Brendan Fraser Fan!!"
2,Bad Movie,I agree with the other reviewers that this is the worse of the Mummymovies. Maria Bello was horribly cast as Evy. There wasn't any spark orwarmth in the way she portrayed this character she is totallyforgettable. The only reason I watched this movie is because I'm abig fan of Brendan Fraser and John Hannah. If you are the type whoneeds to have the complete series of anything you watch like methen look for the cheapest dvd you can find.
1,I was absolutely embarrassed to have rented this movie to watch with my friends.,"There should be a curse to keep the director, producer and writers from ever, ever producing a movie again. I enjoyed the first two Mummies, but this really threw me off. It was as if they handed the story to a 13 year old boy to rewrite. They have Abominable Snowman doing jump kicks and high fives - like white ninja turtles with fur. Then they pasted in lines of cheesy dialog between the scenes of CGI effects. The main characters that you pay to see are in minor roles. The story is chopped together with no flow. For some reason, maybe bribe or ransom, they made Luke Ford a main character. WTH is Luke Ford and what he is doing in a movie that I use to like? Allot of people didn't do their job on this one and someone needs to be fired."
1,Unbelievably Awful,"I did not believe that this movie could possibly be so bad until I saw it. I would have left when the Yeti came out except I was surrounded on either side. There is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters-- they all act as though they are on the stage saying their lines by themselves. Brendan Frazier maintains one tone of voice throughout-- irritated and loud. Maria Bello as Evie is too ""suave"" with none of the endearing clumsiness of Rachel Weisz, and it looks as though she and Fraser can barely stand to be near each other much less be married. There is a hackneyed theme of their grown son being estranged from his parents, which is totally at odds with the second movie. It's kind of like whoever sat down to write this clunker looked for every cliche s/he could find so as to include it in the film. Stay home and rent the first two movies if you don't already have them. This one's a waste of time."
1,Cinema version,I have to agree with all the other negative reviews for this movie. It was a real disappoint and will definitely signal the end of the Mummy franchise. The son is too old compared to his father and the new actress who plays the female lead can't compare to the original. Don't waste your time or money on this one!!
4,Anyone seen any Yetti around here?,"This is the newest installment of ""The Mummy"" series (Brendan Fraser), this is my favorite of the series. With Jet Li (one of my favorites) as The Mummy and Michelle Yeoh in a supporting role, you have a great cast! This movie is almost in the league of the Indiana Jones movies. Great fun with lots of action and adventure. Did I mention the battle with the Yetti? This movie is worth watching!"
3,america's critic,the mummy and jet li-- this was a good film cgi sucked butt the yeti was totally jacked up for a multimillion dollar film fix up the cgi loved the army was creative so in conclusion it slightly worthy of being owned.
4,Another Fun Romp with Legions of Mummies,"Mummy 3, as any good sequel should be, tops the previous films. Yes, the script is not as strong, but the entirely new mythology (Chinese instead of Egyptian) was a welcome change. The best entry in this genre for awhile, topping the new Indy and the last National Treasure. Great effects, as usual, and the required epic battle plus the long-awaited showdown between Li and Yoeh. Here Li is finally featured in an expensive American film. Yes, it's always annoying when actors change (Evie), but Bello wasn't bad (they should have given her more action). The new characters are a welcome addition, especially Isabella Leong. Hopefully part 4 will be made."
3,Great action,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was a great action film. The biggest downside to the film was the acting; Which was some of the worst in the history of cinema. Brendan Fraser reprises his role as Alex O'Connell but his wife has been replaced with someone who cannot act and he has a son. The son looks about the same age as Alex, which is stupid and funny. I mean how old is Brendan Fraser now? 40? He still looks like he is in his late twentys. What's the secert Fraser? Anyways, as I said-awesome action film with great speical effects. The acting is like something you'd view on a straight to dvd or cable tv movie. Enjoy the action but the acting will make you fast foward towards the next action sequence."
4,Must have for your Mummy collection,"Quite enjoyable. Good story line. Didn't care for the ""new"" Evelyn. That chemistry that Rick and she had was missing. That's the only reason why the ratting isn't a 5. BUT... the story line is very good and entertaining."
2,Huge let down,"First, I will say that I am a huge fan of the first two movies. I have watched them both a million times. This installment however, was nothing like those. The change in cating for evie was horrible. She ruined the movie for me...the entire time I am ticked at rick for cheating on his true love. I cannot say enough bad things about her. Other complaints include a much weaker stoty line and a mediocre acting job by the actor who played their son. If you loved the first two don't ruin it with this flimsy film."
3,Give this series a rest,"Wow, a Chinese Mummy. Who would have thought that was possible? Please give up the idea of making this series of movies. While it was somewhat entertaining, it was lacking in so many areas. Maria Bello as Evie? Her accent was awful. She certainly isn't as cute as Rachel Weisz. The action sequences were just downright awful. Jet Li should have been using more Kung Fu moves than just walking around. Brendan Fraser is a funny guy. Just not in this movie. Over all, I would say the movie was alright. Nothing like the first two Mummy movies."
1,Serious disappointment,"The first two Mummy movies were so good, that, even without Rachel Weiss, I thought ""How bad can it be?"" It was really bad. It had some great actors in it, but they had nothing to work with. The price was marked way down by the time I bought it but I'm sorry I spent even that much on it."
2,Complete disappointment,"I was looking forward to watching this movie and when I saw it the disappointment was great. It was nothing compared to the first two. The only reason why I'm bothering to give it two stars is that Brendan Fraser was there. He deservess the stars. Other than that, the storyline wasn't that great. I hated the chemistry between him and Rachel Weisz's replacement. I own the first two but won't bother to purchase this one."
1,Very Disappointing,"This movie was a big let-down. I LOVED the first two Mummy movies in the series and could watch them over and over. This one was written so bad that the lines could be laughed at throughout the entire thing (and I don't mean the comedic lines). The wife is a different person and is awful, son talks like John Wayne and is too old compared to the years that went by, and Jet Li was barely in the movie/had any lines. The special effects in this movie were mediocre in 1995 and that's saying something. The story of it completely broke off from what it was in the first two. The wife has no connection to her past like in the second one whatsoever. I would not recommend this to anyone that loves the first two. If you don't want to ruin the series and have not seen this movie, then don't even think about watching this. I have never been so disappointed in a movie."
2,Disappointing : (,I am a big fan of the Mummies...up until this one. I tried to prepare myself for the fact that Rachel Weisz wasn't in it...unfortunately I guess I wasn't prepared enough. The new Evie just doesn't have the same...something...that Rachel had.I was also very disappointed in the graphics...the graphics have just gone down hill since Mummy 1.I honestly hope they just stop with this one.
2,"Awful, just Awful.","I'm glad i didnt pay to see this one in the theaters. The whole plot itself is laughable, they should have stuck with ancient Egypt.The dialogue was on par with The Scorpion King, and the special effects were way over done.The only reason i gave it 2 starts was Jet Li. God help me, i cant give anything hes in less than that."
2,"Not Worth Unwrapping, 1.5 stars","The first Mummy movie was enjoyable. The second ok, this one is just a DUD!Brendan Fraser doesn't even seem to be the main character anymore, the story is more about his son. Fraser's wife, is a new gal, not the original actress.The whole Chinese theme incorporated into an Egyptian type story was just plain stupid.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Let the Mummy Rest in Peace!,The Mummy is back!But tings have changed.After the dropout from Rachel Weisz.Maria Bello was hired to fill in her shoes.Don't get me wrong she is an awesome actress but not for this kind of genre.The whole movie is a bit of this a bit of that and you always ask yourself when will it be over.I think the whole franchise is like a worn out shoe so hopefully it will be over forever.For those who want beat up time do me a favor and R E N T this movie but don't spend one dime for your collection.
1,This is one bad movie,"Two things:1. This is a really bad movie. I couldn't even watch it all the way through.2. If you watch this on your TiVo get ready to sit real close to the TV because it will only display in letterbox, not full widescreen.Letterbox + Widescreen TV = Little tiny movie wrapped by a big huge black box.Amazon, you fail!"
1,disappointed,"WOW! This movie stunk on so many levels, I don't know where to start. My son & I really enjoy watching the first two and were terribly disappointed while struggling to endure through this mess. The story line COULD HAVE been interesting; but the script and the acting was painful to watch. Brandon (whom I love) seemed to be sleepwalking through the movie; and the relationship between him & his son (and his wife) was just stupid. I HATED, HATED the actress who replaced Rachel! Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (whom I also love) were the ONLY interesting characters worth watching. Unfortunately, the martial arts were reduced to a minimum - too bad. Even John Hannah lacked his quirky humor that makes him so endearing. Overall, a big jip!"
1,The Worst of the Mummy Movies,"I'm a diehard fan of The Mummy, and even liked the oft-maligned The Mummy 2. I went into this movie having ignored the trailers and reviews and was incredibly excited about it. Much to my chagrin, it was not only the worst of the Mummy series, but also one of the worst movies I've seen in years.Not only would I suggest avoiding buying this movie, I wouldn't even suggest renting it. If you're new to The Mummy series, stick with the first two movies."
1,Terrible,"What a shame. I was a big fan of the first 2 films. Unfortunately, this one never gets off the ground. Maria Bello was a poor choice as a replacement for Rachel Weisz. This one is a definite pass."
3,Not too good.,I bought this one because I loved the Mummy and the Mummy Returns but this one was kind of hard to watch.
3,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,The movie was a good one but there are gliches in the dvd itself. This is the first time I have gotten one from Amazon that was not perfect.
3,"ok, totally not good but i love Brendan Fraser","Really, not that fan of a plot here. You would think that with all the money thrown into this sure thing. Hollywood could hire some great writers to knock this out, but they didn't. They spent lots of money on everything but the plot. Still good if you are on a plane or home sick!"
3,Fun flick,"I'm not sure why so many people hated this movie. While it wasn't perfect, it wasn't the P-O-S that the negative reviewers claim it to be. Yes, the Dragon Emperor's acting was stiff - there was a lot of chances for some fun acting but he didn't use them - but overall I really enjoyed this movie. I loved the costumes and plot, and the zombie soldiers going against one another was an added treat, even if there were a few historical inaccuracies in the movie. The Yeti were another treat that I really enjoyed, I think this has to be the best portrayal of the Abominable Snowmen I've ever seen! While not the best of the Mummy series, it is still highly enjoyable. 3.5/5 stars"
1,Bad Mummy,Simply awful. We'll be giving away the used copy we bought. Most of this movie was a blurry CGI chase scene. Rachel was very wise........
3,"OK, but not up to par","This movie had a great plot line that could have been easlily fleshed out, but the actors weere flat and uninteresting. Evie and Rick came across as clueless parnets and Alex had almost no personality at all. The only one that really kept to carecter was Jonathan. Very disappoint in Brendon Fraiser. They really need to check their casting and writing"
2,Mummy 3 not as good as 1 & 2,Mummy 3 is not as good as the first two. It is not as funny and you don't like the characters as much.
3,Mediocre Mediocrity,"I could go to great lengths to summarize ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""-write an in depth review calling out its flat story telling and ""meh"" action scenes. I could wax poetic about how Brendan Fraser looks exhausted and the absence of Rachel Weisz and Oded Fehr is felt with all the subtlety of a Boeing 747 landing on your house, but when it all comes down to it-It just really wasn't a very good movie was it? It's too bad too, because I've always had a soft spot in my heart for this series. At least the actor playing Alex looks like he's having a good time even if no one else does-the only bright spot in an otherwise forgettable movie."
3,No way,"There is no way this movie should receive over three stars. And the only reason I grant the extra star is because I understand and respect the amount of work it took to create the visual effects in the movie. The storyline was extremely poor. There was absolutely no chemistry between the married couple. Where in the world did Alex's accent go? He had an English accent as a little boy and now he sounds like he is from Brooklyn.I am one of the biggest fans of the previous two movies. I even liked part two where people were ready to string the director up by his toenails for releasing such a thing. But this one?...oh my. Horrible! I really thought that Jet Li would ruin the flick but he was very good. It was the main actors that ruined it. They really needed to fire the replacement actress and beg Rachel to come back to play Eve.But still after saying all that, I feel obligated to end the trilogy by purchasing this. I want to complete the set nothing more nothing less."
3,So-so movie,"This movie was ok. There were some things good about it and some things bad. First, the bad ones... Rachel was not in it(that was a big let down), Alex was a bit too old, and CG effects could've been a little better. The good, Jet Li and the story plot. That's why my rating is only 3 stars. I liked it but then I didn't. I think for those that have not seen the Mummy movies, watch them first and then this one and judge for yourself."
3,The Mummy 3,"Like most movie series, this one is getting tired. The story line was not as spellbinding as the previous movies in the series, and the fact that ""Evie"" was not the Evie of the previous 2 movies in the series, takes the zing out of it. I hate when characters are replaced. Just write out the character. The series loses credibility when a character is replaced by someone new. Over all I would say that the 3rd in the series was not up to the standard of the previous 2 movies."
1,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (Widescreen),"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (Widescreen) is the third movie in the series and it is painfully bad. The plot is a joke. Bredan Fraser phones in a lame performance and the replacement actress for his wife try as she might the chemistry is just not there. The first two movies were full of fun, wit and good adventure. This move is nothing short of a travesty. Pointless violence, a plot written by Dr Nick Riviera from the Simpsons or maybe even Homer himself, shoddy acting. I was so disapointed considering that the first two movies are good enough to watch again and again. This one I will avoid att all costs. 1/5."
2,Disappointing,"This was not in the same class as the first two Mummy films. The story line was decent but the acting was poor. The chemistry was missing between the actors and it was very disappointing.They need to find the first Evie and bring her back. She added much to the first two movies. She was an intelligent klutz in the first films, which added dimension to her character. This one doesn't fit with Fraser very well. The characters were not well developed and it just didn't do the film justice."
3,Not the best for this exam,"I have used many of Mike Meyers books and found them to be very helpful in passing my exams. However this ""Passport"" series is lacking. This book in peticular has numerous gramatical errors (using wrong words) that make you read the sentences over several times to get the jist of what is being said. Not to mention the CD with the test questions has several wrong answers.Looking past these shortcomings, I felt that I could max the test after reading the book. Needless to say I did not do as well as I thought. Many of the questions that are on the exam are a little more indepth than what the book covers.Dont get me wrong this book will help you pass, but with little room for error."
5,This is the best book ever written,"It doesn't matter where you grew up, EB is the best book you will ever read. The way that Mr. Kemp put it together, it was almost as if he was writing a poem. If you have ever read this, or want to read this masterpiece, I suggest you buy yourself more than one copy. Lend to a friend, a nieghbor, a relative. Whoever. But the words that this book speaks need to be spread. Take my word for it."
2,Slide show,"This video is okay, but I had expected a much more updated video for my classroom, not an old slide-show with faded pictures that are not even all that great."
5,one of the best medieval reads ever!,"I was sad to see this book end, it was so incredible and really drew me in. I felt a real connection to these characters and have read it again several times since because I was so involved with their story. If you are a medieval lover, and even if you're not, Taming the Wolf will take your breath away!"
2,...,"I think I read the wrong book...I keep seeing people say that the leading lady in this is smart but she couldn't find her way out of an imaginary paper bag. She would run into the woods screaming, bumping into trees until she died of either a brain hemorrhage or dehydration."
3,"Fun, but only for the true Muppet fan!","I received this game for Christmas and have played it for the past few days. This game is very similar to Medievil II. You are Robin and you have to rescue Kermit, Miss Piggy and the others from an evil curse. To rescue your friends, you must explore different levels and gather energy. When you have gathered everything from the level you move on to the next one. I love the muppets and so, this game is pretty fun. Unless you are a big fan of the Henson gang; I would pass this one up. There are other games with better graphics and more fun interactions."
2,jargon overrides fidelity to the primary texts,"Mr Baucom likes the falsely scientific vocabulary of theory so much that he both occasionally says the obvious in a way that sounds precious and also sometimes follows the logic of a wrongly framed argument far away from the primary text he purports to discuss.For example, instead of writing the obvious fact that maps were important to the Raj, the reader finds this: ""Within that archive, the map occupies a position of privilege.""A few paragraphs later, the reader learns that Kim's becoming a British intelligence agent somehow erases Kim's identity as the little friend of all the world. Kim is then resurrected as ""the zombielike R17."" Nothing can be further from the actual depiction of Kim in the novel. Kim's identity as a British agent remains as vivid as it was before he takes service with the Raj and his devotion to the lama as intense. And even at the book's opening Kim unwittingly enforces British dominance in bullying an Indian child."
3,"Worth reading, but not top notch","The pros and cons lead to an average, or slightly higher than average rating. I really liked the fact that both protagonists were writers; Julian writes & says some deliciously romantic things. Their misunderstandings were presented in such a way that you came to understand their actions and animosities. Charles is a truly despicable villain. Very sexy book, often emotionally captivating.On the down side, Letitia ....I never liked her. Julian did not handle her well, and neither did Sophia. The Charles situation was never fully resolved, and there needed to be more about what Julian and Sophia loved about each other."
4,Passable...,"This book was okay. I liked the characters and I liked the story line and how it all got started. I was a little disappointed in the development and ending. It was a comfortable read, but it lacked any climax or intrigue. While it was a good book, it wasn't fantastic."
4,Into Temptation Review,Great reading! I love this author and the characters; they seem human with flaws like us. I enjoyed the story very much! High recommend it to any romance reader.
2,Tempted...To Throw my Kindle Down,the troubles between the two main characters seemed to drag on and on and on. I truly could not stand Julian. He acted as if everyone around him should just accept that he was a selfish idiot and forgive him for it. I think not. I dont think he deserved Sophias love. I couldnt stand Julians sister. She was even more of a brat than Julian. After all Sophia went through in her first marriage because of Julians weak character I might add I thought she deserved a little more respect and REVENGE. Instead she chases after Julian. Whatever.
3,its ok...,I happen to be one of those girls that thinks Bam can be funny but usually he is just a bratty self centered kid. What makes him funny to me are Ryan Dunn and Brandon DiCamillo. Without those guys he is just a little bit too annoying.. The movie should have had them in it.. One stooge just isn't as funny without the other two.
3,Not as good as it should be.,"I have been a fan of CKY for years now. I was a big fan of all of the movies CKY did, but the latest is just a sad exteneded verson of Viva La Bam. The biggest diaspointment was the missing members from the original CKY. If you really enjoy Bam and you loved the MTV show Viva La Bam then you should like this movie. But, if you are a true fan of CKY you will be disapointent in the direction that this film takes."
2,Scripted waste of time,"I'm quite surprised to see so many glowing reviews on Amazon. A quick Google search reveals unending amounts of harsh criticism. I got this expecting something like Jackass or Viva La Bam. However it's quickly apparent that nearly everything is strictly scripted.. It's just not believable. Even though Viva La Bam was somewhat scripted it still felt far more spontaneous and improvised, and Don Vito was hilarious! But this is a tragedy of which alcohol couldn't even fix.There were only two scenes that I genuinely enjoyed. The first was when they picked up a guy, pulled down his pants, then blasted snow up his butt with a snow blower. The other was a 5 second scene when Collette De Benedetto steps out of a hot tub. Snow enema, hot girl, that's it!This seriously had epic potential but completely fails as a result of their use of a lame, unbelievable script instead of a more reality based production method.."
2,Personally... not a fan.,"There are plenty of other reviews which explain the plot very well. I just wanted to share my own opinion on it.I had wanted to watch this movie for a few years and just never got the chance. Wouldn't you know that literally 2 days after it arriving it was on MTV. I would have been much happier watching it for free. Its not to say its the worst thing ever, as it did have its good moments, just not really what I was hoping for.My friends hated it WAY more than I as they were expecting basically another Jackass movie, which it really is not, saying its just too forced and disingenuous. Their top 3 favorite things about the movie (and basically the only three things really) were:1: Bam's woman in bed in panties2: The map of Finland tattoo3: Andy McCoy from Hanoi RocksI'm not saying ""do not buy this movie"", just that you may want to check it out as a rental. If you do purchase it I hope you enjoy it more than I did."
1,Just not what it used to be,"When Bam was up to his old hi-jinks on Jackass and (at least initially) on Viva La Bam, he and his crew were fun to watch. The casts were a bit different depending on the era, but there was a stable core to the friend group that lent some enjoyment to watching them act like idiots. To a certain extent, the old material felt real and honest - it was alot like they'd just taken a camera along while they were goofing off.But this new material is absolutely nothing of the sort. Bam's new friends are all complete idiots and self-absorbed jerks, and the show is so scripted and edited that it's basically just Reality TV (tm) for mook-addicted MTV flunkies. ""Bam's Where is Santa?"" feels fake, contrived, forced, drawn out, artificial, planned line-by-line, etc. It's joyless and not funny. It seems the days when Bam (and company) was fun to watch are long gone.They need to go back to the beginning and be real again, or quit making TV."
4,I enjoyed it but could have used Don Vito and the Cky Crew,"Fun Bam Margera film to watch on Christmas or around Christmas but the big problem with the movie is it's missing Ryan Dunn, Brandon Dicamillo, Raab Himself, Rake Yohn, and even missing Don Vito but Vito isn't in this due to the sexual assault problems and he was banned from TV for 10 years which really sucks and his scenes were removed from ""Jackass Number Two"" and they never saw the light and day... to this day nobody has been able to see those stunts. But still this movie is a lot of fun to watch on Christmas Eve and I recommend you get it because its worth a buy. (If you can get the blu ray because the quality is amazing)"
3,.,The book is very strong in concept and characters but it becomes obvious that Eagle is not meant to write a full length novel. Cutting out at least 100 pages would make this really amazing.
3,Not her best,"I found the plot to be a little forced and overly predictable, even for the genre. Kathleen Eagle has written some great romances (esp. This Time Forever), and I look forward to her next one. But The Night Remembers was a disappointment."
2,Not good,"i din't like this book i din't hate it either but i think that it needed some definate improvements, it felt like it was meant to be a mystery book and romance as an afterthought, this was my first book with kathleen Eagle never again."
2,"good, but...","I have the PVL-858. I like the camera, loaded with features, but we live on the east coast, and every summer that I try to use the camera, I get the message ""Dew Detected"" and the thing shuts off automatically. The days are humid here, and I can't use it in the least humidity. What good is a camcorder that is so unreliable? Missed our vacation to Bermuda, and our summers at home and at the beach. ARGH!!!!!!!!!"
5,Splendid Text,"Like calculus, unsaturated zone hydrology can only be made so easy. As a soils professor and instructor of this subject, I have waited for 20 years for a text of this sort to come along. It gives me the flexibility to teach both undergraduate and graduate classes. For the students there are many worked examples and for the instructors a great manual that you can order separately. I get the best of both worlds and the students have what is in my opinion, the finest text and reference in this field. Many kudos to the authors for a job well done!"
5,ezio pinza is worth the price,"It was kind of hard to find, but to hear Pinza's unique voice is worth it. The rest of the cast is almost as good.The bonus is that it was nice to get a note saying ""Enjoy"" from the seller. I would think that means that they appreciate the music."
5,Not just 'improve your vision',"This is a great book. It's not just about improving your vision. It's about opening your mind and expanding your life. The enhancement of the 3d vision is a tool capable of developing your peripheral vision, that responds per reading almost 80 percent of all the (visual) information surrounding you. The practicing of your 3d vision gives you more physical balance, but it also connects you with your intuition and activates parts of your brain which are usually only marginally used. Never heard people saying human beings use only 10 percent of their brain capacity? Give yourself a chance of 'seing' more."
4,A fine addition to the series,"I bought this book shortly after getting Magic Eye II, and I can see how much they've improved their techniques in the intervening years. There are some gorgeous images in this book. I particularly like the butterfly floaters. They've also made it easier to see the images with the help of the two squares at the top of each page, that let you know when you've diverged your eyes just enough. The vision improvement info is another story. Why does Marc Grossman claim you can only do the ""palming"" exercise for 3 minutes? What terrible thing does he think would happen if you did it longer? (Such as a 1/2 hour, which is how long I routinely do it, without a problem.) Also many of the claims seem over the top. Magic Eye can bring you serenity? Make you more intuitive? Even give you feelings of love? C'mon. Nevertheless, for fans of stereograms, this is well worth adding to your collection."
3,"good pictures, bad text","The pictures in this book are good, but beware! About every other page is a full page of text, of self-gloating from the authors! I am sure that their arms are tired from patting themselves on the back; and there are a bunch of stupid quotes from supposed customers of how their pictures cure cancer and the like... I would say that half of the book is a waste of paper because of this. I do not think I would buy this book again, false advertising."
5,Great fun!,Great fun and good for the eyes as well. Converging and diverging the eyes are very important if you want to try to improve your eyesight naturally.
3,Big print 4 people like me.,"Thank you for the blow up size print,so people like me can get a more closer look w/o breaking the magnifi glass to try,and read it. It gives dates for all of the songs so i'm 99.9% sure they are all original radio recordings."
5,Chicago Bears Pro-Line football helmet,I am very satisfied with my purchase. It is a nice collectible.
4,Bears Helmet,"Happy with the item. Carefully packed as well.A little disapointed that there is no orange ""Bears""sticker on the back of the helmet like the players have."
3,Could of been Better................,"I like the songs Cant fight this feeling, by REO Speedwagon, Working for the weekend, by Loverboy, and Wont hold you back, by Toto. I am a huge 80's fan, with a huge collection, containg REO Speedwagon ""greatest hits"" and Loverboy ""get lucky"", and many Toto songs. I like the songs they picked from these bands to put on this album. But the rest of the songs I had not heard of and more or less did not need to here. This had few good songs on it, and I think they could of made this record better. So in my opinion keep searching amazon.com for some better 80's soundracts."
5,Great looking BODY!!,This body looks sweet on my T-MAXX. I Can't wait to get it out on the open dirt and wreck it!
1,Karate teacher,If you dont know one thing about karate this might be a good book for you I gave.50 cents for the book that was to much.dont waste you time on this book.
4,A good module for beginning players and DM,"Well, this module was written by Mike Carr, not Gary Gygax. This is an earliest module for D&D (not included those for OD&D, which is the predecessor of D&D and AD&D.) It is not the best module, though, it is unique. As the only one module with ""Stock-your-own"" complex (one exception should be the recalled version of B3), it is well for a starting DM to judge and place suitable monsters and treasures at the rooms. Tables for stocking are provided in the module. Afterall, the story line and the objective are quite simple....to find treasures and to gain experience. Used item is not hard to find! Enjoy it!"
5,Worth Searching Out!,"This may be the best of all the modules (pre-designed ready-to-play adventures) that TSR published for Dungeons and Dragons. Mike Carr, the original writer (I'm not sure why Gary Gygax is credited above) did a brilliant job fleshing out each room of the dungeon to the tiniest detail, giving adventurers lots to explore and discover. He also left out just enough detail (including the specific placement of monsters and treasure) to allow the DM to adapt the adventure to players or characters of any experience level, and to his or her inclinations. The detailed descriptions of rooms and materials are good enough to be ""borrowed"" and used in other scenarios. Even the map is well-done, although the shade of blue used for the printing is too dim (as is the case with all the old D&D modules). This one is well worth searching out at used game stores or at the next Con you attend."
4,Another nice trio of Xander episodes,"Like the first volume of this ""sub-series,"" these are truly episodes that focus on the troubled life of Xander Harris. ""The Zeppo"" is my favorite, mainly because it strikes my funny bone head-on to think that Coredlia actually knows about the Marx Brothers. Actually, I figured that particular allusion went over the heads of the vast majority of the Buffy audience. But it is nice that Joss tosses a bone to us older fans every once in a while. Anyhow, for my money this is one of the better Buffy novelizations."
5,It makes sense....,"yes, French does make sense. At least now that someone has pointed out what others have not. Mr. Thomas teaches that French isn't as ""foreign"" as it seems. Words that we hear everyday in English are the same words in French. It's all in how you say it (and spell it). Words (mainly the verbs) that I had a hard time understanding, now make sense. I do recommend this CD set if you want to try to parlez en francais. I am going to buy the deluxe set. I just wish that he had a set that could take me to an intermediate-advance level."
3,Very Good .. But leaves you hanging,"I just finished the two set CD of Speak French with Michel Thomas. Though the CDs were extremely good, very interesting and informative, i was not sure what i had learnt and how and where do i apply my skills. I did not even know how to ask any one ""What is your name ?"". There were quite a few basic things that should have been taught which would have helped me atleast start a conversation in french with a complete stranger.But all said, if you want to understand the language in a manner whiich is fun and easy, go for this. That is why i am going for the full set to check out if anything comes out of it."
4,Good series,"I really like this style of learning a new language. I enjoyed the learning to speak German cds much more than I did these. There is something about the female student on the French cd's that is simply irritating. Otherwise, this is a strong product."
1,An ok crash course for travellers; bad for serious learners,"From my experience of learning English as a second language, I have to say this is a very bad way to learn a new language. Have you met foreigners who spoke broken English? You might just become the guy who speaks bad French by learning it this way. Yes it's so much better to be able to communicate than not, even with a broken language. But if you are serious about learning French, check out ""Pimsleur"" and ""French in Action""."
2,you must be joking,"What a wierd teaching method. I wanted to brush up on my French for a trip and this CD, while I suppose it helped with pronunciation, was all about ""la situation economique et politique."" Given the world situation at the moment that was...er...on point, but a bit to erudite for my purposes. Or for anyone's I would think unless you're an academic."
5,Excelente,"Soy venezolano,médico y hablo español e Inglés, decidí adqurir los CD del Sr Thomas en Francés , y encuentro que son excelentes , y de gran ayuda , creo que el mejor sistema de aprendizaje de Idiomas por este sistema, los recomiedo ampliamente"
5,Priced right and work well,Needed replacement blades so I could finish cutting up some limbs and these were priced right. They were shipped extremely fast and did what they were supposed to do. I would buy them again.
3,Thin as others have stated,"I guess for the discounted price, these are OK. But as another reviewer stated, these aren't very good for green wood. I used a blade with a Ryobi 18V reciprocating saw on three 2-1/2 inch diameter oak tree branches, and the blade began to bend on the first branch. By the end of cutting the third branch, I just threw that blade away. It bothers me that these are clearly labeled for pruning, but they weren't very good on green wood."
3,Average at best!,"I found this album lackluster compared to the original hits. It's an appreciative crowd and he does all the songs, but I prefer the originals. Sounds flat."
4,It'll Get You Zouking,"This album has a great variety of artists of the unfortunately little-known Carribean Island genre of music, Zouk. Heartrending in their cries of unrequited love, these songs are guaranteed to get your hips swaying and your feet moving. This album made a big splash in West Africa and can be heard in all the hottest dance clubs."
5,"MOVE OVER KITCHENAID, THE KING IS HERE!!","OH, MY GOD!! Talk about power!! I was going back and forth between ""the known"" Kitchenaid or Delonghi. I was going to get a Viking, but read too many bad reviews.I decided on the Delonghi, firstly, because of the name. I have several Delonghi products and am very happy with them. Delonghi acquired Kenwood, so I decided to read some of the reviews for the Kenwood Stand Mixer and they were mostly favorable (nothing is perfect). Secondly, at 980 watts, it is much higher than the 500+ you get with the top of the line Kitchenaid. Thirdly, I read too many reviews that, while praised Kitchenaid, talked about the motor burning out when making dough. HELLO!! the motor is extremely important!!Let me tell you, this mixer has power!! I made 17 pies, a cake, and 24 tarts for Christmas and making my own dough was a breeze!!Kitchenaid may be the best for some people, but Delonghi is for me!!Be Blessed!!"
1,"don,t know what to think","i had the same delivery problem as another reviewer, ordered the in stock product and had to wait 9 weeks to get the mixer it looks great except forthe wimpy power cord but after plugging it in we found out it doesn't workI will be returning and trying another one, hope it doesn't take another 9 weeks"
1,Disapointing Mixer,"I also placed my order last December and waited until March to get it. After running 5 mins. it would only run at high speed, then shut down all together. Would reset, but then the same result, only run at high speed and then shut down. I also question the 1100 watt rating, do not believe this mixer has anymore power than Kitch Aid. I went to DeLonghi's web site and do not see the mixer listed anymore. Maybe they are not making them? I returned the mix for full refund, Amazon was good about it."
3,"DeLonghi DSM7 Exclusive 7-Quart Stand Mixer, Brushed Aluminum","I loved this mixer -- so much more than my Kitchen Aid mixer. However, I give my mixers quite a workout and the gear mechanism broke. DeLonghi said to send it to a repair facility at the other end of the state which I did. After four months in the shop and with my telephone calls between the shop and DeLonghi on a weekly basis, DeLonghi never got the necessary parts to the repair shop to fix my mixer! Four months was long enough and I demanded a refund of my purchase price. I've been waiting now for four weeks for the check to come through. I'm calling them again today!"
5,Excelent product !!!,"I'm impresed with the power of motor of this mixer and It has 10 (TEN) years of warranty!!!. It can mix any kind of dough, from the softest to hardest with high velocity without any problems... Just I love it!Highly recomended!"
5,One of the Best Ever Family Shows,"The Best of the Cosby ShowI actually have the whole series on the Cosby Show, starting with Season One. I still get numerous laughs from the show and am in the process of watching them all again. I think it was one of, if not the best, series ever!"
5,"Good, Clean Entertainment!","I was very pleased with the quality of the DVD, Best of the Cosby Show. Naturally, I knew it would be funny because as a young person, I watched the TV shows all of the time. I ordered from Amazon because I knew it was a company that could be trusted."
4,Nice sampling,"This is a nice sampling of the better Cosby episodes. I liked the show, but didn't want to purchase and watch entire season sets. This set has most of the episodes that I remember from the series run. Don't expect superb picture quality, but it looks at least as good as the original broadcasts. There are no bonuses. Episodes are in broadcast order. For example, the first is from season 1, then you get one or two from each of the seasons that followed, in chronological order."
4,"Sigh, what a great show.","My family (and my husband's family) grew up on the Cosby show, so this was a treasure to find. We laughed our way through these episodes when we were gathered together, first with my family, then with my husband's family. I do think the earlier ones on this DVD tend to be more lighthearted/funny than the later ones, but they are all enjoyable. In my opinion, this show was kind of the ""gold standard"" of family shows. They don't make 'em like they used to!!"
5,There Are No Family Shows Like This One!,This product and all of the seasons are wholesome and at the same time very realistic and entertaining! The acting is superb and in my opinion one of the greatest family shows of all time! Any one who loves Bill Cosby and his crew will absolutely fall head over heels in love with all of these shows including this DVD!
3,"Great product, but don't trust the picture","Product was excellent and arrived very quickly. The price was excellent too. One issue, however, is that the amazon ad depicts a helmet with the old classic detroit lions logo. Mine arrived with the new 2012 logo. I happen to love the new logo, but i'd purchased the helmet in the first place to get it autographed by ""classic era"" barry sanders. I didnt have enough time to attempt a return, so i just went with it."
3,Kitain Plays Chopin,"My mother was the prodigy of Mr. Kitain in the 1940s, so it was particularly important to me to finally hear his playing in earnest. I found the playing to be on par with the greatest players technically, however i was disappointed in the hurried tempos and lack of emotion expressed. For those interested in his history, he was friend and peer of Vladimir Horowitz, at the Kiev Conservatory in their native Russia."
4,"All I can say is ...WOW! But, don't buy this one. Buy ""Nobody But Jesus""!!!!!!!!!!!!!","If you are interested in hearing new material from the powerful vocal cords of Ms. Melba Moore, purchase ""Nobody But Jesus"" ...not ""I'm Sill Here"". I was told that Melba receives no $$$$ from this project because of a record company dispute. Melba has her own label/new record company and has added tracks which makes it a ""new CD"".Check my review for Melba's,""Nobody But Jesus"". But.....Melba has been on Broadway and recording for many years. I am so glad that ""Champions"" ""The Other Side Of The Rainbow"" ""Call On Me"" w/ Shirley Murdock and ""Raise Up Sister"" came out of her throat!!!! :)""Call On Me"" w/ Shirley is one highlight on this CD. Those 2 siiiiiiiiiiiiiiing that song very well!!! ""Champions"" is an upbeat tune that should get some airplay but we know that the airwaves are owned by the people but he people have no say!!!Buy this CD and get lifted!!!"
3,DIDN'T WE SEE THIS ONE BEFORE?,"Everyone looked so familiar in this. If you are an avid horror movie fan you should feel at home watching this one. It is a Chainsaw Massacre rip off, better done than most. The Staunton family was great. Kathy Lamkin as the head of the clan was superb. The 6 college kids left much to be desired. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was just that the writer forgot to give them interesting character. I guess the wheel chair guy had already been done. If you like watching bloody women getting tied down and having their clothes removed to their undergarments, then this movie is for you."
1,DADDY'S DISAPPOINTMENT,"Horror icon George Romero's son Cameron doesn't fare so well in this thrill-less thriller. Horrid acting, an illiterate script and inept direction make for a disastrous film.A real time-waster."
4,Interesting Horror,"Yes this was a typical Horror film but I have to say it looked visually beautiful. The cinematography was great! The story plot kinda wavers all over the place but some of the killings are unique and some of the acting is really good. I liked the lead girl, Cristen Coppen, you don't really get to see to much of her at the start of the movie but it makes for a better ending when you see her kick ass and pull out a great performance. For you guys you also get to see her take her top off and she has a smokin body. The guy who plays the drop out doc, Charlie Bodin, shows some really good emotion in some parts of the film. He seemed to go in and out for me but I actually ended up liking him. Kathy Lamkin you don't see to much of but she is not bad and the guy who is the killer, BJ Hendricks, impressive for not having any dialogue really. Hope this review is helpful. If you aren't willing to buy then for sure rent for something different."
1,Don't believe the (fake) hype!!!,"I am going to assume that the reviewers are family or friends. If not, they need to see more horror films.I'll just give you the lowdown in a few points.Story-Several young people are walking through Virginia in 1969 and meet up with a crazy family. There is a little more to the story but that is the setup. Wow, original!Acting-It wasn't completely horrible since they mostly talked for the first hour.Gore-Nothing happened for the first hour and then there were maybe two decent scenes, but nothing you haven't seen if you've watched any torture-porn type movies in the last 5 years.Scare factor-Zero! I don't know what else to say. There was no tension whatsoever. I swear that there was more tension and suspense in a Disney movie. I am not kidding!!There is more to complain about but I'll just leave it that Cameron Romero should stay away from making movies and leave it to his father. I haven't liked all of George Romero's films but he knows what he's doing."
2,What a huge disappointment,"Just finished watching this movie, as a matter of fact the credits are still rolling, and I must say I have not seen such bad acting and horrible plot in some time. I was so excited to see it after all the hype I read about it, and being such a fan of camerons father, I thought how could I go wrong. Well was I duped. I wonder if the vidoe store will give me my []back. The amazing thing is that 6 veral young adults cant fight there way away from an elderly woman in a wheelchair, an obese woman who cant take 10 steps without running out of breath, and her half wit son. Seriously, how stupid do they think we are. My Recomendation..... Dont waste your time."
2,Unoriginal and poorly edited derivative gore nonsense!!,"Every cliche you associate with the Crazy Redneck Slasher genre is here in this movie. The sexed-up hitchikers, the broken down truck, the mentally challenged son, the meat hooks and the dirt-poor overbearing extended family who just might be having you for dinner if you dont stop running round in circles. I personally have seen all this before and better told. Because the movie was so obvious I kind of wondered why Cameron Romero bothered? Its tired and jaded and didnt get a cinema release in the UK. Also there are huge plot holes and inconsistencies. I would say avoid!!"
4,Not too bad...,"Kind of a 70's throwback, and of course it is pretty well a texas chainsaw rip-off,but really a decent flick, especially considering the garbage that passes for horror atyour local cinema. It is worth a watch, and like I said, nothing ground breaking here,just a decent horror flick for a saturday nite..."
3,Kathy Lamkin Steals Movie,"Everyone looked so familiar in this. If you are an avid horror movie fan you should feel at home watching this one. It is a Chainsaw Massacre rip off, better done than most. Te film takes place in 1969 as the proverbial young adults wind up in rural America.The Staunton family was portrayed great. Kathy Lamkin as the head of the clan was superb. The 6 college kids left much to be desired. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was just that the writer forgot to give them interesting character. I guess the wheel chair guy had already been done. If you like watching bloody women getting tied down and having their clothes removed to their undergarments, this one delivers."
2,Bad with some redeeming qualities,I had to forward through some of this. I blame the writer. Has some decent effects in the gore aspects and the camera work through these scenes is decent. Also decent panoramic work of the country side.The worst is the plot. There is very little development. Was there something about a wealthy accident victim that needed feet? There is no close to the story if that is the case.
1,The apple falls far,"I saw this low budget attempt at horror and was very disapointed. This film is so slow and feeble I had trouble sitting through it. I had thought that maybe G.Romero would have helped his son with the artistic side of film making but alas he was obviously busy elsewhere when his son made this movie. Boring, slow, bad acted, poorly directed. Stay clear of this rip off of a movie. It had shades of every hillbilly killing 20 somethings movie made{ Wrong Turn, The Hills Have Eyes, ect.} but failed to deliver even close to what these films captured with ease."
4,"Great set, Almost as good as a Leatherman Micra","I don't normally review things, but this little wonder has caught my eye. The multi-tool is a must have for most people and this one is no exception, it has pliers, it has about a billion uses, and its relatively small for what you get.Pros:Great set of pliersKnife was sharp coming out of packagescrewdriver works wellThe clamp closes everything down so you don't poke yourselfCons:Its a bit on the hefty side,the Scissors are a &^%$%$dirt gets in everywhereBasically, if you are looking for a leatherman with in a micro version, get this instead of the micra.Thank me later."
4,Who's this longhair?,"Who's this longhair, you ask? Well, this is an alternative to Jesse James, who's currently riding the wave as being the most recognised chopper builder in the world, taking over where Arlen Ness and the rest left off. Billy Lane's autobiography is an interesting read, an insight into a guy who loves what he does, and builds interesting, artistic bikes.The hubless rear wheel he pioneered is probably his greatest achievements, and it appears that he allowed Jesse James to use his six-gun design too. I guess behind the scenes certain ideas are shared freely between friends.Overall a nice book to have if you're into Choppers. Nice to read and with all full colour photos on high quality paper."
3,Short read picture book,"Kinda disapointed with this book. His views, a few short stories and alot of pics. Nothing really deep."
4,Great look into the life and style of an era,"This was a great book if your a fan of Billy Lane and the custom chopper scene of the early decade. Billy was pretty candid about this lifestyle and attitudes, and was suprizingly entertaining. The pictures were great although many were re-collected from old magazine shoots and/or the discovery channel."
3,Unit is nice - power pack goes bad!,"This under-counter AM/FM/7"" Color TV with DVD player is nice looking, but the power pack simply died within a month of very light use. Finding a replacement power pack was impossible - it just is not sold seperately. Also, GE sold this division, so warrantee repair/replacement was nothing but a run-around. These are not made any longer - just fyi everybody! I bought a second one just to get the power pack, and put the unit and remote up for auction as ""partially complete - missing power pack"". Better than having holes in my cabinetry! When it works, it's a very cool unit. Unit gets 5 stars, power pack gets 1 star. 3 Stars average!"
2,AC Adapter frustration,"I wish I knew then what I know now, but reading these reviews are the same issue I am having. I got a couple of years out of my unit, but then the power supply went bad. NO ONE SELLS THIS ITEM!!! I am now going to have to get another unit, probably more compatible with iPod/iPad. This started good, but ended badly. :("
1,Leather...Really?,"I received mt ""leather"" padfolio today,,,,and was shocked!It is NOT leather...but cheap plastic!Awful....I could smell the plastic when I opened the envelope!I am trying to return it now and that is not turning out to be easy!Awful......"
4,Good item for the price,"I think this is a good padfolio for the price. I think the leather is uniform in appearance and is durable. I looks expensive, not cheap. However, it doesn't really strike me as that kind of top quality leather that would develop a fine petina with years of use.I purchased it in black and it has a nice padded feel, and I like the layout of the pockets on the left hand inside panel. There is room for small items like business cards and paper clips in addition to larger items. The pen is basically tucked into a cut in the spine of the binder, and would best accommodate a normal sized pen. In order to get papers to fit into the left flap, I had to run my hand through the interior a few times and pull the flap away from the backing.Overall, I am pleased and would recommend this padfolio. Considering getting the tan too. Every professional and job seeker really should have one of these, and this is a good find."
1,One of the Worst.,"I have read nearly all of the TNG books, and I have to say: this is without doubt one of the worst.There were some good things about the book (not many but some), one of which was the descriptions of Ne'elat, which I found to be quite vivid, and the other is the front cover, which has a nice use of gold lettering and colour, although I'm not sure this should be considered when buying the book. Other than that though ...As far as bad points go, there is practically no insight into the characters of the crew or the aliens. I will go as far to admit that I admired the author's style of writing, and it would have been a good book if it hadn't been so MIND-NUMBINGLY BORING!I could tell from the start that this was not going to be one of TNG's best offerings, and unfortunately I was proved right. There was no plot to speak of, way too much speaking, and as I said before, no character information.In my opinion: don't waste your money. Buy 'Imzadi' or 'Q in Law'."
1,Don't Bother,"I have read 75% of the Next Gen. books, and this is, by far, the worst of the lot.The plot, (if you can call it that), is extremely boring.The action is non-existant. I had difficulty forcing myself to finish the book. Don't bother, it's a waste of time."
1,a yawner,Little action and less interest. This is definatly one of the poorest star trek novels yet. The formula plot has no surprises. The ending was just plain silly.
5,We love Calico Critters !,"My daughter recived this set for Christmas. I remember the Sylvanian Family from when I was young and was thrilled to see these again. This was our first peice from the Critters. She loves it, we have since added on the house, a few families, some more furniture, the family room and nursery. Both of my kids will play with this for hours. The pieces are small so we are very carfeful and put them away in a safe place after play. Great for imaganitive play."
3,Too many tiny parts!,"I thought my 4 1/2 year old would really like this as she has seen the little ""critters"" in our local toy store. But she's barely played with it since Christmas. It may be more of a show piece/ collector kind of toy. There are all these tiny paper books and boxes that could be easily lost and smushed. I think it's probably better for an older child."
2,"Ok, but not recommended.","I was not that thrilled with the female firefighter Francey. For reasons that were not rational to me, she would not have a normal relationship with Alex. She was drawn to him but would not follow her feelings. She said they should just be friends. Apparently she felt no one could be a spouse to her due to the overtime and high risk demands of her job. When she and Alex finally start having more of a relationship, she was inconsiderate to him. The story was not enjoyable due to her character.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: two. Setting: current day Rockford, New York. Copyright: 1999. Genre: contemporary romance."
4,feel the heat,i think that this book is very well written. there are enough details to envision what is going on. i especially like the way that francey's parents got a long. i would love to know what happens to alex and francey. how much more did they heat up after the fire?
2,Torturing Alex could be title.,"While I understood Francey's hesitations, this carried on for too long. I really started to dislike her and Alex. They both seemed weak. I did like the romance with the parents, but it too seemed awfully tortured. All and all, this book had too much angst. K. Shay writes real well. I just didn't like her people. (And there's way too much-- are they or aren't they, going on with the sexual aspect of the book.)"
4,Very good quality for price,"You know how the backs of some comforters are a rougher fabric you wouldn't want next to your skin? I was a little uneasy about buying this without being able to feel the fabric, but it was a pleasant surprise that the underside of this comforter is soft and cozy. It is of medium weight; would not be suitable for colder climates, but a nice weight for year round use in mild weather. The dust ruffle is a little flimsy, but the comforter itself is a good value, and the bonus of the throw pillow makes this what I consider a great bargain."
1,dont get this unless u can aprreciate one hit wonders,"bye this cd for ""who can it be know' dont buy it expecing much from the rest of the tracks this band is nothing but a bunch of one it wonders"
1,"Not a 4 lb bag, as advertised","When I got my bags of fertilizer delivered, I was surprised to discover that they were labelled as 2.75 lb bags, despite the product description calling them 4 lb bags. I've notified Amazon's customer service by email and I expect that they will make it right (they usually are good about this kind of thing).But you should be aware of what you are paying for - at least until the web guys can update their description.My one star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the product - that I can't yet judge. And if Amazon fixes the discrepancy between what I paid for and what I got, I'll remove that rating (you can't submit a review without making a rating)."
1,Toilet paper,"This book is not a good way to prepare for the 5.0 exam. It's just the 1.4 book with a couple of extra paragraphs added. The new language features are not properly covered. The section on generics is ridiculous. Do not rely on this book and don't use it as the sole means to prepare yourself.On top of that there are just so many errors in the book, its just an insult! Use it for one thing only!"
2,"Lots of text, lots of errors","I read the 3rd edition of this book in preparation for the Java programmers exam - its an old version, but I read it since a colleague had it handy. There's a lot of information in this book, but too much of it is incorrect for my liking. In some sections there are serious errors on nearly every page. If it was a 1st edition book it might be understandable, but how can a book like this get to its third edition with so many mistakes? If you're an experienced Java programmer, you'll probably just laugh at the errors (as I did), but if you really want a book to learn Java to pass the exam, then I suggest you try another one - this book will only confuse you and make things worse."
1,I do not recommend this book at all.,"The book does provide some high-level overview of Java 1.5 features, and that's where it stops. It doesn't provide anywhere near enough detail and application to be used as either a test preparation tool or as a language reference.I regret purchasing this book and would not recommend it to anyone, even if it were free."
3,Dont Depend completely on this book for SCJP exam,"This book gives some basic idea to prepare for exam . Do your own research on topics like Generics , Threads , Collections etc and do some sample questions from Sun site.This book gave me 75% material for exam , but dont rely completly on this book to pass the exam."
5,cute doggie clothes,"red fleece jacket xsmall, the jacket is so cute, my little chihuahua looks adorable, I was so excited when I finally got the jacket, it fits nice over other clothes she wears, i would recommend this adorable jacket to anyone who has a little dog, they look so cute in dog clothes, i can't wait to go back to amazon.com to see what else they have for my little dog,"
4,Just a reminder,"Need I remind some critics that when you are crtiquing a book that you need to give the reader of your review an general overview of the book and its characters,that is what determines whether or not to buy the book. Lifting a few scences from the book does not help since obviously we haven't read the book and don't know what your'e talking about. Therefore I beseech those who want to write a review, write it as if you were a professional book reviewer and not just telling your friend of some recent read."
4,A Hands Down Great Book For Beginning Managers,"This book is amazing in that it gives a comprehensive,consise, and simple explanation for finicial statements. I have read many such books, yet this tops them all for its relative simplicity while still being able to get across its point. I would recommend this book to any beginning accountant, manager, or investor. This book shed light on information overlooked by unexperienced businessmen and is a great buy."
5,Easy To Understand,"A good book to understand the basics. Well written for even those with very, very little Finance experience to comprehend."
3,Financial Statements,"This book does not very in-depth into the intricacies of financial statements, but it is a good book and for a newcomer would be very useful. The author does a great job explaining the types of financial statements in a simple manner but still respecting the reader and not insulting their intelligence. If anyone is aspiring to start a business and have no accounting experience or knowledge, this book does a great read."
4,simplified accounting,"I purchased this book over a year ago and I still use it for reference. Its a simplified guide into accounting, informative and easy to understand."
5,Kill for rock n' roll!,This may be the greatest southern metal album of all time and if you don't buy it then you are a poser. Posers suck.
2,"Still selling, or did it ever?","Oh my god, I actually have this book....I didn't buy it but was given it by the ""author""...It's not funny unless you read it right after reading your own obituary, then everything is funny.Buy it now on e-bay from the author, you will then have a certified autographed copy.Could be worth a dollar or two someday.Come on folks, make this man a millionaire!"
3,"Entertaining, delightful, but...","HB Marcus certainly knows how to entertain and make a reader laugh. His imagination rings throughout the story. I did, however, find the writing itself a bit juvenile, lacking in any literary merit. Not much characterization between Spider and Smoky. Not to mention several grammatical errors and a couple of spelling errors. As he says, though, he is not here to write the great American novel, he just wants to entertain. And he certainly does that."
4,Convenient Second Hard Drive,"This 500 GB hard drive is very convenient if you have an HP media center computer as there is an empty front compartment on the HP computer waiting for this drive. You just slip it in and it automatically provides an extra 500 GB of storage. Unit also comes with USB cable and power cable if you use it with other computers or laptops. However, if you are going to do the latter, you can buy cheaper alternative from Western Digital [Elements HD that I have on my laptops]. I paid the extra $ for the convenience. Unfortunately, WD and other HD makers do not make units that fit directly into the HP compartment, even though WD or Hitachi probably makes the drive for HP."
2,Failed after only 3 weeks!,"I actually loved this drive for the first two weeks. The best thing about it is that it plugs directly into the built-in drive bay on my HP media center PC. Unfortunately, the little, built-in fan on the back of the drive started making a strange, intermittent noise after only 2 weeks and I knew it was going to fail soon. Sure enough, the drive failed one week later.[...] Anyway, if the drive had lasted longer I would probably give it 4 or 5 stars."
3,"Great Idea, but I had problems with mine.","After just two months I'm having problems with the hard drive. There is a problem with the connection inside the bay where the drive sits. It still works fine as an external drive with a USB cable, but the reason to get this drive is so that it will work inside the bay. Has anyone else had the same experience as me?"
5,Excellent Drive. So Easy.,"I rarely write reviews but I am so happy with this product. It is the easiest to use. No disks or having to load software. Just plug it in and it is ready to go. The price is not bad either. I was expecting to have some sort of problem or glitch but really there was nothing. Very fast transfer. In case you are wondering, it works with Windows Vista."
5,HP 500 GB Personal Media Drive,I purchased this to use the Drive in my HP Elite computer. This Drive is well built and works are described.
5,Great Hard Drive,Bought this to replace the original system 240GB that crashed. Great drive with fast response time.
1,hp media drive 500G,"Ended up returning this product. Spent a week w/hp tech trying to get it to work. They finally concluded it was bad & I should return it. But they wouldn't accept the return w/o all original packing materials (which I no longer had). When I told them I wouldn't buy another HP because of their strict return policy, they offered to send me the packing materials needed to return the drive. I just returned to Amazon -- no original packing needed, no hassles. I may have just gotten a bad drive, and maybe generally there aren't problems, but I didn't like their attitude about the return. Their product was bad, they should have been offering to replace it with no hassles. I had to threaten not to buy their products before they decided to cooperate. Their tech (e-mail only -- phone help cost money, I believe) was polite, but not helpful. Most of their suggestions were pretty obvious and had already been tried before I contacted them."
5,Personal Media Drive,Easy to use: Just plug it into the HP computer slot and it does the work. No extra wires or no extra room required. Great Idea from HP.
5,Great Hard drive,This is my second hard drive. I already had another HP 300Gb and got this because they work good on y computer.
1,4 Months over warranty and dead,"Bought the media drive on Dec. 30, 2008. The past two weeks (Apr. 2010) the drive starting making a squealing noise. Called HP and they said the drive was out of warranty, defective, and I could purchase a new drive with an extended warranty. Thanks HP, I'll take my business elsewhere."
4,HP Personal Media Drive,Excellent product. It is hot removable. My wife edits books on her desktop and can take all the images and files with her to meetings. It is nice not to have to mess with cables etc.
4,Excellent external drive,I've been looking for an external hard drive and this one complements my desktop well.
4,Good storage bang for buck,"If you have an HP computer that this drive will slide into, this is the best external hard drive you can get. No extra plugs or cables and changing between multiple drives is easy as cake. USB 2.0 limits speed a little, but other than that it's almost like having a quick change internal drive. Highly recommended."
4,"Smart, practical hardware from HP","So far, very pleased with this product. However, seeing that HP pocket media drives with similar storage capacities are also coming up, I would in the end prefer them instead of this one (Because of the obvious difference in size and weight, of course). Otherwise, a stylish and reliable piece of hardware all in all."
1,There are better products out there,"I read a lot about the loud grinding noises that the HP personal media drives are plagued with. My PMD also started to grind so loud, only a month after I received it. The WORST part though is sending it in to HP to repair. They lost it after UPS delivered it. Customer Service says the Repair Center found it two weeks ago, meanwhile, Customer Service is giving me the runaround and the website says it's still lost. They keep asking for another 48 hours and try to collect the same information every time I call in about the same issue.Avoid the hassle and buy from a better company. I wish I had."
2,Nice looking...poor longevity,"I purchased this drive from Amazon on 6/22/08 and a little over a year later it is getting ready to die.I made my selection based on the good reviews for this drive.It certainly is attractive and compact and it was a fine drive for the about the first 9 months or so, then it started to whine a bit occasionally.Now it whines, grinds, and clicks almost constantly. It's clear it is not long for this world.Seems like it lasted just long enough to get past warranty.Does anyone make a USB drive with some staying power? I would like to get 3 or 4 years out of one. May be that is expecting too much.Since one of the main uses of such drives is for backups, it appears I need a backup drive for my backup drive.I am going to try a FANTOM USB drive next."
2,Disappointing release,"While the movie itself is a very entertaining John Astin vehicle, the DVD is terribly disappointing. It's completely unrestored with severe film scratches, sparkles and audio pops throughout.And to add insult to injury, there is a rather large, dark and distracting watermark in the lower right corner of the screen.If you're looking for a high quality release of this film, look elsewhere."
3,"Wow, pretty lame","I first saw this movie quite a few years ago and I thought it was funny. After watching it now, I see that I was mistaken. Just really hokey."
5,"Not ""Blazing Saddles"" but still very funny","The talking is fast. And plenty of camp. It is not ""Blazing Saddles"" (which is funny in a whole other direction) - there is hardly much swearing (except for just about all the characters saying ""Molly-B-Damn"" because they are too stupid to say ""Molybdenum""). And much of the movie (I think) exists just to set up the 40 second monologue that John Astin gives toward the end. May be too slow or intellectual (???) by today's standards but I think this movie is a hoot!"
4,DVD its differant,This is a different kind of movie. its funny and entertaining. A laffable one. I hope you enjoy it. Pop some corn and relax and enjoy with a croud.
1,WOW !! Is this movie bad!!,Save your three bucks! This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen! It's slow and NOT FUNNY!
2,A zillion errors,"While there is a lot of content there are literally hundreds of errors in this book. Everthing from words spelled incorrectly, to wrong file names used to incorrect explanations of regular expressions. There are multiple pages repeated (93-96 is almost verbatim to 97-100)!!It looks to me like it was put together in a couple weeks with little to no review."
5,BOOK PUBLISHING ENCYCLOPEDIA,DAN POYNTER'S BOOK PUBLISHING ENCYCLOPEDIA A-Z IS FULL OF GREAT TIPS AND RESOURCES BOOK FOR AUTHORS OF ALL AGES. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST DAN POYNER BOOK I OWN AND IT IS EASY TO READY AND UNDERSTAND.
2,Not an encyclopedia,"This book is not an encyclopedia. It's a collection of internet links. Many of the links take me to the author's own website, where there is one teaser paragraph and a link to purchase an article. Why should I pay this author twice? At least there are links to other resources that actually exist as articles and not ads. Unfortunately many of these links are out of date. ""Encyclopedia"" is a grandiose overstatement of what this book is and I'm very disappointed in it. It is doubly discouraging to feel suckered by a book that pretends to be helpful, ""how-to,"" and a resource for beginners when it's really a profit center for the author. Welcome to publishing, indeed."
3,OK,"I thought the first volume was more comprehensive and better organized. Some of the resources he lists are easy to find through web searches. Of course, if you know where to look. All in all, I'd say it's okay."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"The ""encyclopedia"" needs to be within reach on every publisher's desk. It has been an invaluable resource for me in the publishing of my first book! Thank you, Dan! Donna P. Savage, Author of The Man and The Shark: A Modern Day Fable of Awakening and Rebirth"
5,Simply marvelous,"A simply marvelous collection of some of Doris' lesser-known songs -- some released here for the first time! You will find yourself listening to this disc over and over. The several rock-influenced cuts on the disc, including the title tune, will suprise some. You will love this."
5,"""Kiss Me Again, Stranger""","""Kiss Me Again, Stranger"" should have been a major hit for Doris Day. It was recorded around the same time she recorded ""Secret Love"", and you can tell by the sound of Doris's glorious voice.What a great song! Nobody could sing this as well as Doris Day."
5,Marie Callender's Fat Free Seasoned Croutons are the best.,"My local grocer stopped carrying Marie Callender's Croutons. I've tried all the other brands and they don't compare. Freshness, crunchiness, delicious flavor and the right size. They are the best. Always a generous portion of seasoning in the bottom of the bag that can be sprinkled over your salad for an added treat."
5,Simply Wonderful,"Everything a crouton should be: crunchy, flavorful, and surprisingly low-cal. Good enough to eat right out of the bag, but of course will enhance just about every salad they grace. The garlic flavor is present but not overpowering. I've tried many croutons over the years, however MC is simply the best."
3,another mis-lead,"this frontal insert is out of whack...first of all, the song that brought this on with the Supremes was BABY LOVE. probaly a number one from the first three of THE SUPREMES. At that time it included Flo Ballard with the group and they're most solid hits......the sketch in the insert showsher replacement who did not sing this song......i find that offensed toFLO's work with the group."
1,Wrong Model number and NOT USB powered,"The person who created this page made a big mistake. The model number IDVD8PE is wrong! The actual IDVD8PE has its own power supply, not powered by USB."
1,Very very boring,"This was one of the most boring dully written books that I have ever read. While the events are not without interest; the change over 3 seasons of a village in Spain from being almost medievally backward to one being transformed by the onset of tourism, the characters are flat and unbelievable. Maybe if you like fishing it would appeal but otherwise I would steer clear. Sorry to be so negative"
3,Excellent overview but lacks detail.,"James has done an excellent job of covering the new features of Netware 5. Unfortunately if you are looking for down and dirty ""how to"" information you will be vastly sorry. I don't recommend this book for the experienced Netware admin or engineer."
1,No NW5 details,"I boughth this book because it was (Jan99) the only admin book about NW5. I'm disappointed. If you are new to Netware that's a good first book for you but if you are a CNE, experienced ...etc. than look somewhere else (e.g. Netware5 Administrator's Handbook) This book lacks details about everything in NW5, it is not the HOW-TO book that I need."
3,Good reference but lack of detail examples,"A useful reference book, the only book that I find info and explanations on installing/configuring NDPS printing."
5,Solid Performer,"This compressor has been reliable and exceeded my expectations so far. I am a professional fence builder and have put this unit to the test. So far this compressor has held up like a champ. No stalls no hiccups no problems. As far as a free accessory kit???? with this, all I can say the compressor has been total bang for the buck and it is not fair to slam this item with one star because you want something for nothing. I would recommend this to any professional out there looking for value."
4,a good mix of solid metal,"This is good solid metal. All the songs (but one) rock with the best, as the title of the CD suggests. The one poor song is ""I Wish You were a Beer"", because of its retarded lyrics and generally poor sound. However, don't let that get you down, for ""Battle Angels"", ""Fire and Love"", ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and ""Waitin' for the Wizard"" are all excellent. I would even say that ""Battle Angels"" by itself, with its crazy rippin' guitars and mad vocals, is worth buying the CD for. Listen to this CD if you like hard and angry metal that's awesomely well done. It's got variety and great quality."
2,not woth the price,toys and description were differtent when we got them. toys were very small for $10.00. very flimsy material. my son played with them one time and they lost their excitment. if i realized how small they were first i would not of bought them for $10.00
2,Boring,The man was too bossy and the woman was pretty much an idiot. This book would have been much better if the woman had been smart and savvy. As it was she was like a sheep who would try to rebel now and then and get into worse trouble. I hate books like this! There was pretty good sexual tension but there was nothing to back it up. Boring book.
5,Very useful Book,This book was recommended by our psychologist and it was worth reading! It is like a text book but worth reading and easy to apply and worth every effort.
5,a great book,"The power if Positive Parenting it's a great book. Very very useful. I raccomend the reading to every parent. But this book can be useful for twachers, trainers, and everyone who works in contant with other people."
5,The only way to learn to love and raise a great family!!!,"We have made this our parenting bible for life. If read daily, one is able to stay on a healthy parenting course for years. With the guidance of this book family members become cooperative, considerate and loving. The parents become relaxed, in control and good natured."
5,A One Way Ticket to Successful Parenting!,"I was raised that you had to be tough on your kids so that they would grow up strong. Showing compassion was a sign of weakness. Now I have the proof that you can be peaceful in your parenting and still get excellent results. After having read DOZENS of parenting books, I have finally found the most effective and comprehensive approach!! You will do nothing but be amazed at how much more you can enjoy parenting after applying these principles!!!"
5,Book used for doctorate level work,the book is easy to read and follow. I am reviewing the content and the format makes sense and easier to adhere to the dissertation process.
2,Only If You Have To...,"As a life long learner, an experienced practioner and graduate student (again), I throughly enjoy my professional library. However, I have two books that I would never have purchased if I had not had to - Editions 7 and 8 of Educational Research. This is a mind-numbing traditional textbook. The authors write with an officious, academic style. While they have tried to incorporate qualitiatve research into their work, the positivist bias is so strong that it comes across as condensending. Also as an older learner, I find the type set and page layout difficult to read. There are so many better books, I would not buy this one if you can avoid it."
3,Research Book,"What can I say except research is boring.....needed this book for a class in my Masters program, made an A in the course but not because of the book since we hardly opened it......"
5,forest cello cd,"Lovely mello music. Very relaxing, excellent for my holistic therapy treatments and also to play at home."
5,Great book,this is a very comprehensive text that helps me understand a theory of psoriasis I have not worked with before. I am inspired to adopt much of the recommendations as it makes alot of sense.
3,"Good, but beware!","I've been on Dr. Pagano's for about a week, and it seems to be slowly working. It at least feels good to be doing something tangible to try to fight psoriasis.But, be warned! I thought I pooped a lot before, but this diet is a new beast. Now, I'd say I have about 12 minutes from realizing I have to poop until I'm actually pooping. Now road trips are dangerous, long runs are risky, and standing in any sort of line can be incredibly stressful. It's like walking around with a grenade in your pants, and every few hours someone runs by and pulls the pin. I just really hope this ends up working."
5,awesome book,This book is very educational and has helped me to get my psoriasis under control and they are quickly fading!
5,This totally worked for me!!!!,"If you have psoriasis, buy this book. I had a moderate to severe case of psoriasis, followed these simple instructions, and the psorasis almost totally cleared in a few months. Don't waste money on external medicines. This book explains how to clear psoriasis and become much healthier in the process."
1,If it walks like a duck...,"...and sounds like a duck, especially if it goes ""QUACK QUACK:, then it's a duck. This book is a load of horsefeathers. Frequent enemas to cure psoriasis? High colonics? Here's the best piece of advice psoriasis sufferers can ever receive that the book doesn't address in the detail it should: REDUCE STRESS. That's it. No all-apple diets, no enemas. Reduce stress. Examine your psychological state. Are you a nervous person? Do you worry about things all the time? That's your problem. You don't need this book to help. Yes, use the topical oils and listerine for the scalp for short-term relief. But a book on stress reduction and a regular dose of anti-anxiety medication or therapy will truly be your best friend if you want relief from psoriasis."
2,A Chiropracter wrote this book and i have grave doubts.,I am sure good eating habits would improve most of the populaltions health but i have grave doubts about this book and its author.
5,Update of my 1/21/99 review,"It's been six months since my first review and I'd like to give you an update. I am 99% clear and I use Dovonex on the remaining 1%. I have posted my experiences on various psoriasis web sites and have had written correspondence with psoriasis sufferers from all over the world. If you'd like to get off the steroids and light treatments, this may be your ticket. It doesn't work for everyone but if you have a moderate to severe case, why not give it a try. What have you got to lose but your psoriasis. You can reach me at the above address if you need or want additional information."
5,Six days and my skin was 85% clear,"After 20+ years of struggling with this disease, I finally found answers to all my questions in this one book. My results were quick and dramatic. Disipline is required, but well worth the effort. I plan to buy a copy for my dermatologist who told me "" learn to live with it, there are no cures."""
5,I'm convinced !!,"I have never written a review but I felt that it is important to share this experience. My 4 year old had a BAD case of Psoriasis and after 8 doctors who said the same thing with no real result, I turned to the internet and found this book. With lots of skepticism and out of desperation, I ordered it. It has been three months since we started the regiment and she is now completely cleared. It is interesting that most of the things mentioned in the book coincide rather well with Chinese medicine and its theories. I am convinced that this approach works. Yes, it does get into some areas in unnecessary details, but if you just try to understand the principles of it, it really works !!!"
5,Amazed In California,"I have had psoriasis for almost 30 years and have suffered all the discomfort and humiliation this disease can cause. I have had dreadful reactions to all the prescription drugs, so the idea of a diet was so welcome. However, I didn't really think it would work. It has been five months,and I have made amazing progress, especially since it is winter. There have been flare ups when I have strayed from the diet or have been under unusual stress. However, I am about 65% clear and what remains is not rough and flaky. All of this improvement has been without any presciption drugs of any kind. The remaining affected areas are reddish or pink, but smooth and flexible. I am confident that the improvement will continue. There is hope for anyone with this affliction, but it does require patience........"
4,"Sounds good but want more details on the ""dos""","I am all for natural alternatives for healing almost anything and the ideas in this book sound like they are feasible. However, this is a hard program to do with a growing boy. Like a normal teenager he is always hungry and the fruits and vegies don't keep him full and he is getting tired of chicken and fish. Lots of ""don'ts"" on the food list... I need more ""do"" ideas. I bought the cookbook, but it doens't have a lot of foods that he likes & virtually nothing that I can send to school in a sack lunch. I really need sack lunch ideas!! I will try the program with modificaitons... wish me luck :-)"
5,Terrorism in South America,This is a unique and very readable book which takes place in the somewhat remote country of Uruguay in South America during a time of terrorism. The historical background of the Tupamaros is accurate and fascinating. The fictional story is suspenseful and the characters are believable. This novel not only takes you away to another culture but recreates a time period in a country that few people know or remember. A good read for anyone who enjoys fiction set in faraway places!
4,Adventure and Romance,"Short stories by this author that I have read tend to have ironic twists which I enjoy immensely. This book did not have the same kind of irony but things did turn out exactly the wrong way for the zealous patriots. The four young people were a mix of idealists and hangers-on, typical of that era. Their parents were clearly of another generation. The characters were typical of the late 60's/early 70's, appealing to a baby-boomer like me.Rather than being action-packed, though there is some action, the story is more thoughtful. The romance, well-expressed and not explicit, mixed with the adventure is probably what has kept this book out of the mainstream. It is much more readable that the ""contract"" books I've read lately. It's a valuable snapshot of an era; books like this are seldom seen. I recommend it."
2,Change is not always for the best,"Although the illustrations are good, this will not appeal to everyone. I was always a bit uncomfortable reading aloud a few of the traditional verses -- ""she whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed"" -- is an especially alarming example. But adults don't always give children enough credit; many generations have mentally sorted through these verses with no lasting harm. The rhythm, cadence and whimsy of the original versions have been sacrificed to be replaced with clumsy morals and motivational messages."
4,3-way folding shovel,"For the money, this folding shovel is very well constructed of heavier steel than I had expected, with good tolerances, not loosely made, like other folding shovels. It folds open and closes easily and smoothly. It compares well with other similar products which cost considerable more. I carry mine in the truck."
4,Good Emergency Shovel,"Very stout. Folds up nicely. This is a real shovel, not a garden trowel like most of the other items in this category. Exactly what I wanted for my vehicle emergency kit. Wouldn't want to take it backpacking due to size and weight. Product arrived with a little rust on it, so I hosed it down with WD-40."
1,Emergency only..as a last resort.,"I differ with the first reviewer. The quality is sub-pare, and the mechanism to lock the handle in place for use is flimsy and the handle stays loose. The canvas pouch is just a bit thicker than a standard cotton pillowcase, and like the shovel, does not look as though it will tolerate any abuse. The blade is of a heavier gauge of metal, but whether of cheap iron or good steel, its hard to say since it has a coat of green paint on it.I purchased two of these shovels, one for the car and one for the pickup, and both shovels and pouches I received have the same lack of quality. I really was not surprised to find that they had been manufactured in China, not Michigan."
3,Folding Shovel,"The shovel is serviceable enough, but the snap on the storage pouch is already tearing out after three or four uses. If there were directions for use in the box, I lost them. If there weren't may want to include that for those of us with more uncommon sense than the other kind. :) For anyone else out there like me, you unfold the shovel and *unscrew* the collar until it's all the down to the shovel blade. That holds the tool open and straight."
3,Like the idea,"I wanted to give my son a portable shovel and this one fit the bill. He has pinched his fingers every time he assembles or disassembles it - could be a problem if it breaks the skin routinely. It looks nice and shiny now, but I'm not sure how the lacquered finish will hold up with use."
4,Pretty nice shovel,"Picked up two of these for G.O.O.D. bags. The shovels are good and sturdy. The cover isn't so good, but I didn't get them for the cover. I'll just put them in a GI surplus rigid cover."
4,The Punishement of Success,"RATS, BATS & VATS ended with the young vat hero rescuing an heiress and precipitating the only significant victory against the aliens who are invading the planet. Naturally, the high brass does not like this at all as it reflects poorly on them. They are also pressured by the helpful allied species ""advising"" the humans. Something has to be done and that something is that all of the heroes must be punished severely.Naturally, the heroes do not care for this at all. The old gang of larcenous rats, revolutionary bats, drama queen primates, young hero and rich heiress come together again to not only save themselves but save their planet. They do so with a laugh on every page."
3,Enneagram for parenting,"The Enneagram of Parenting is a good overview of the 9 types but it could use some help in identifying your child's type. Lots of great pictures that illustrate the actions/beliefs of each type, but it is still difficult to evaluate the correct Enneagram type."
2,my kids liked it,"I think my mistake was that i have read ""The Wisdom of the Enneagram"" by Riso/Hudson, which was very in depth and extremely helpful with my personal evolution. I was looking for the same experience with this book, but did not find it. I feel like it just scraped the surface and I didn't really learn that much. Now, my 11 and 13 year olds got more out of it than i did. sooooo, i suppose it all depends on what you are looking for. There is not much help in the how to raise the 9 types..."
1,item too small for realistic use,"This item is as advertised. However, it is very small. It is very hard to read. I will need to buy a magnifying glass to see the chords I chart."
4,Amazingly strong!,"Well, this is a very good hard rock CD. This new Gary BArden outfit is playing authentic hard rock with energy and precison, full of big choruses, speedy solos and great riffs. Even the slow ones are very good. And I also must point to the fact that Barden (maybe using the new recording technology available, or mayde due to vocal improvement) is singing much better than in his old Michael Schenker Group days, back in the eighties. Also, the lyrics are better, because the lyrics he wrote for Michael Schenker Group were a joke, one of the worst ever."
1,Don't get it,This was a waste of money didn't help at all. Would never buy it again go with good stuff. No good.
5,A must for your Geotrax set!,"This is a must if you have the Geotrax starter set. My son received the basic Tracktown Railway at 2 1/2 and we immediately went out and bought him elevation track packs. Adults have to set the layout up, and its a little bit trickier in 3 dimensions, but the elevation is what makes Geotrax way better than any other train set!Only drawback is that you can't just buy one elevation track pack. This one would be the most logical buy if you do only buy one set though. It has ramps to get up to level 2, but this is much more fun if you get up to level 3. I would recommend adding the Ramps to this set. We have 1 of each of the 3 elevation packs and that's enough to connect all the elevation accessories we have (clock tower, suspension bridge, mile high mountain).Definitely add to your Geotrax, its worth it! Your child will love it and so will you"
2,Perhaps helpful for artists,"This small book is fun to read, but it's usefulness is limited mainly to painters. Not as good as ""Art & Fear"", which addresses the same material in a more general and insightful way."
4,Gertrude and Alice and Picasso and Hemingway and.....,"Though this film has been criticized for some historical inaccuracies, overall it gives a very good feeling for the period and the relationships between some of the most famous writers and artists of the 20th century. Linda Hunt's portrayal of Alice B. Toklas is flawless, as are some of the scenes between her and Stein. It is almost as if you are ""a fly on the wall"", ease-dropping on two icons of ""the lost generation.""The settings are superb and the opening scene of Stein and Toklas proof-reading one of Stein's books is amazing!A must for anyone interested in the literature and art of the 1920s and 1930s.Also the interview with the director on the DVD version provides some fascinating insights into how the script was developed as well as how the movie was cast and made.A must-have for anyone interested in this literary period!"
5,one of my all time favorites,"I have been waiting seemingly forever for this to come out on DVD. I taped it from public television years ago and the tape is well-worn to the point of disintegrating.The settings are lushly beautiful and I can't wait to see them on DVD instead of a grainy tape. Linda Basset and Linda Hunt are captivating and you actually feel as if you have met Gertrude and Alice. It inspired me to visit their gravesite in Pere Lachaise in Paris.Yes it is slow. Slow and luxuriant, like the summer evenings it portrays. Enjoy!"
5,Super read,I love to read at odd moments while waiting - and this book filled lots of those moments with pleasure. Loved the tales.
3,it's okay,"This was mostly for a class, but it moves rather slowly and wasn't really my favorite. Semi-interesting, but not one that I felt the need to hang onto forever."
2,burning mad at 3 am,"I feel angry and duped by BOSE. today I had my second, yes second, GSX321 system installed and it worked wonders for all of 7 hours before it began to shut down after a minute or less. Would never have believed the other negative reviews posted here had this not just happened to me. I bought the first unit two months ago and it worked for all of a couple of weeks until it too just began shutting itself off.for the second unit, today, I had the BOSE staff do the installation, so nothing would go wrong. boy was I foooled. another 400 dollars wasted.that bose knows about this and does nothing but ship out replacement units, and they do do this fast, must confirm they know it's a lemon and are just trying to hide this from the public.SHAME SHAME SHAME. Don't waste your hard earned $1500 on this garbage."
4,Darn those crazy kids.,"A short (56 pages) Grant Morrison story that contains neither superheroes nor science fiction. The plot is similar to that of NATURAL BORN KILLERS, where 2 youngsters run off to take drugs and kill people. Like that film, this story is also a dark comedy, although this one takes a more aloof and antiseptic tone than the film did. The tale gets much of its energy from its complete and matter-of-fact disregard of any ethics or morality.Philip Bond's colorful artwork contibutes a lot toward the dry humor in this story. He draws people's faces and their expressions quite well, which is particularly useful in the numerous asides to the reader, where the girl looks directly out of the page and talks to you. It reminds me of some movies that have used this device.Although not the greatest Grant Morrison story ever written, it's a malignant little comic with a certain charm, and worth reading if you can find a copy somewhere."
4,Had to catch up,"When I started the book, I didn't realize that the person telling the story was going to be using so much scientific language. I had to keep re-reading things to figure out what they would mean had I said it myself. Once I got with the flow though, the story was very interesting & I ended up finishing the book in one sitting. I just haf to find out what it was! I plan on reading the rest of the H. P. Lovecraft collection asap. O yhought it was great!"
5,Lovecraft in the long form,"Lovecrafts' strengths ran to short stories and he rarely ventured into longer forms, but this novella is perhaps one of his best works. Inspired at least in part the Antarctic explorations taking place in the early '30's and by Poes' Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym. Lovecraft took the mythology of his previous works and showed instead the eon's ago origins of the gods and monsters of his earlier tales.Highly recommended in any edition."
4,creepy...,"well, this book is wierd, unpredictable and creepy... a good reading.just to make clear: i'm from isreal and not native to the inglish languge.yet even so, after managing to read the over descriptional begining, i culdn't stop reading.summing up: a good book, if you can hundle the difficult words and ignore the total lack of dialouge. also a great start for new lovecraft readers."
4,C'est bon.....,Dany really makes music come to life. This is a good album to have in your collection. The music is easy listening and brings out the French in you. Highly recommended as with all other Dany Brilliant CDs
5,One of the best in the music history!!!!!,Great music. His voice will make you trumble. Wish to be able to find more CD's like that. I can listen to it 24 hrs a day and 365 day a year. Fabulous!!! Amazing!!!!! Fantastic!!!!!You get whole Paris on one CD. Love it!!!!!
2,Peter Pan remembers it as the best of times....,"Todd Gitlin shows he's lost none of the exuberance of youth and gained none of the wisdom that usually comes with age (and/or a career in academia) in this one. About as intellectually rigorous as the 60's phrase ""Oh, wow, hea-vy, man!"", this book becomes somewhat disturbing as the knowledgeable reader becomes increasingly aware of its shortcomings in dealing with some of the outright criminal activities of the more violent politicos and certain outlaw ""allies"" such as the Black Panthers street gang. Too bad. Some of us Berserkly types learned a lot from the movement, including the important reasons for its failure. Gitlin appears to have learned nothing --- or perhaps the comparison should be to leftists of the 30's whose first loyalty was always to ""the line"" no matter what experience might say"
2,Not a finished product...,I bought this game because I love warhammer and warhammer 40K. I thought THQ did a suburb job with the dawn of war series for warhammer 40K. I was excited to see warhammer universe get a (second) chance with Mark of chaos.The game has good graphics and sound and is playable but I for example:1) The multiplayer mode for me is unplayable because there are no multiplayer maps.2) Game periodically crashed during campaign mode.3)AI units get lost or cannot move from point A to B unless it is a stright line and clear terrain.4)AI units forget to defend.Issues 1-2 could be fixed with a patch but were not. I feel this game could be good if they would have released it has a finished product or just supported it.
3,Warhammer Mark Of Chaos,"The game it self is pretty cool. Long load times and fairly boring combat make it suck. I bought this game because I really enjoyed Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War. I still have more fun with Dawn of War and Dark Crusade. Hopefully the expansion for Mark of Chaos will be a huge improvement. (Like Dark Crusade was for Dawn of War.)"
1,One battle lost = game over!,"If you lose too many units in a single battle you might as well give up because you can progress no further in the campaign because there's no way to get additional gold to buy units without continually conquering. Which means if you lose even one or two units near the beginning you are done for. Might as well start over and replay the same scenarios you just played.Plus this came on six CDs and doesn't even have a DVD version so it took forever to install this monkey. Utterly worthless on all counts, what a waste of $50. I blame the gamespot review that said this game was good."
5,It's a good game,"Caveat: it runs rather slowly (especially load times) on my computer, but that's because I haven't upgraded since 2003.The gameplay is excellent (although the campaigns are a little bit too linear); read an actual review somewhere if you want details."
2,"Wow, are you kidding me?","I am a big fan of RTS's and MMO's. I heard that there was an MMO of Warhammer being released in the future so I decided to pick this game up to get hyped up for it. This was a mistake & I want my money back. I don't think I will ever play an RTS ever again. The gameplay is absolutely horrific, with nothing fun and surprising coming up at you. It's limits brings you back to Age of Empires II. I think the creators focused way too much on putting in mini cintematics at every turn of the game. The only good thing is the character customization which is not worth buying the game for. Do yourselves a favor and don't get this game. Pick up AOEIII or anything else really. Just don't make the same mistake I made."
5,Valuable Resource for the Netadmin test,"I just got done aceing the MCSE exam 70-216. This was a nasty exam! This book helped me understand how things I already knew about worked in actual practice. I thought I understood WINS, DNS, DHCP and RAS, but this book brings the information together in a way that helps you use it in answering the exam questions. With this book and the resource kit, I beat this test. On to the next one!"
5,TCP/IP is revealed to the clueless,"OK, I admit it. I learned my TCP/IP for Windows NT exams from reading Exam Cram. Needless to say, I passed the Windows NT TCP/IP test, but couldn't tell a subnet from a supernet. Now I have a job in the industry and I needed to actually learn TCP/IP, especially since we are moving up to Windows 2000 in our shop.This book is unreal in how good things are explained. Great detail in describing RRAS, WINS, DNS, and the TCP stack. Using the information in the book I am now up to speed on TCP/IP. Enough to pass the 70-216 test! Not bad for a NT MCSE!For Real, this book helped a lot. I owe the author's a beer on this one."
5,Good TCP/IP and Networking Book,We are in the process of moving from NT to Win2k and my boss made me the project manager. I had to get on top of Win2k networking fast. I bought this book on the recommendation of several of my co workers. Glad I got it. The book is informative and detailed in explanations and examples. A must have for the busy guy like me.
3,OK product but nothing spectacular,I bought this game for my 6 years old daughter. While the game does have a few good ideas and moments I wouldn't say that it's a good product. At the age of 6 kids needs to be pulled in the educational game instead of being forced by the parents. This game in some situations looks like a definite overkill for 6 years old while in others it's too simple. The one thing is certain - my daughter is not engaged and it takes a lot of efforts to ask her to play on a computer this game which never happened before. So while this game does have a few good ideas and is a decent learning product it's far from being perfect or even good enough.
1,Sounds Good,"My nephew loves educational games he can play on the computer and this looked like it would be a good one. I was wrong, not only does it not preform poorly on newer operating systems, but my nephew and his freinds found it boring."
2,AN AWFULL SOFTWARE,"I am totally satisfied with the service i got from Amazon.com, but the software is a horrible one.The content is good but the software makes the product look very bad.The PC hangs up quite frequently and forces the computer to restart.It would have been good with a good software."
2,OK garden book,"I bought this book thinking it would give some practical advice for a beginner in gardening in the Washington DC metropolitan area. To my disappointment this book wasn't that useful for me. I didn't care much for the writing style, too much talk but little useful information. When it comes to specific plants, often there's just one paragraph of each. And there's no pictures just paintings throughout the whole book. This is definitely a huge drawback to me."
5,"Easy Read, Really Useful Book on Communications","I like They Just Don't Get It a lot! Four reasons: it's short and took 45 minutes to read; it presents practical things you can try out to see how they work; it doesn't take itself so seriously that it can't allow amusing pictures to illustrate its points; and, maybe this is the best reason of all, it caused me to rethink and wonder about good communications between people long after I shelved the book.No doubt, a short, illustrated book with easy-to-test principles isn't everybody's cup of tea. But, I've been testing the principles daily and I think the authors are onto something valuable and very practical. We're quick to blame the other party when our discussions turn sour, so when we turn a critical eye to our own role, (a lesson from the book,) I've learned a bunch about how to improve discussions. This book helped me get a handle on my own role. Great stuff."
2,Interesting,"Filled with interesting information however, Jeffrey does not give his sources for his information. The information does get repetitive almost as if he were writing a report for school and had to meet the minimum word count. He spends a lot of time explaining how our government has a part in setting up for the end of the world and at times seems rather pessimistic. Better selections would be books by John Hagee"
4,A Worthwhile Read.,"This is a well thought out book - a very Long read though however. I could see that a lot of thought and research went into this book. It was a little hard to follow, and it's helpful to be informed on the goings on in the world to understand some of this book. Some of the information in the book wasn't more fully explained so that a general reader could understand. It's almost like two books were stuffed into one with the amount of information presented in Mr. Jeffrey's book. (I would have liked to see more information explaining certain things in more detail so I wouldn't have minded if this were presented as two books.) This is an important latter day book, and I would definitely recommend having this book in any religious study library."
3,one of the better..,ive read many outlines in this vien. this is one of the better but an overemphasis on russia in bible prophecy.
1,Waist of Paper,"This book is a waist of paper. The writer is obviously mentally and emotionally disturbed and a paranoid schitzophrenic at best.I don't know what is more disturbing the fact the author got this published of that people actually read and believe this nonsense. The author obviously glossed over the Bible passage ""Love thy neibor as thy self.""His anti-enviromentalism is almost Satanic. The enviroment is Gods creation and we're supposed to take care of it. Why not? and he also skipped over the part about ""not judging"" anyone. He certainly missed Matthew 25:40.I must say that I am unsure what the point of this book is? Because Christianity by nature is community oriented. And Grant R. Jeffrey is another obvious VICTOM of modern american individualism."
3,interseting but repetitive.,"'Prince' is packed with stunning revelations, biblical comparisons to current issues and apocolyptic theories. All very nerve shattering. It makes you want to run straight to church and repent. but it has one flaw: about halfway into the book the information begins to become repetitive. Buy it anyway though, It's one of the more interesting books I've ever read"
5,Interesting!,"This was the first book that I ever bought dealing with Bible prophecies. Not knowing much about the subject at all, I learned a lot about matters such as the Anti-Christ, Armageddon, Rapture, Mark of the Beast, etc. I recommend this book for anyone who would like to learn about Bible prophecies being fulfilled."
3,garmin nuvi dash mount,Garmin has changed the mount type so that you must attach the specially fitted (non industry standard plug-end) car charger in to the mount itself rather than the unit. While it makes it easy to remove the GPS itself it is more cumbersome to plug in and out which is necessary if you want to remove the mount when parking in a public. Suggest pairing this with an easily removable dash pad rather than attaching to your windshield. Would like to see Garmin improve the overall quality of their mounts to that of TomTom.
5,Better than the adapter that came with the Garmin unit,"We lost the Garmin suction mount, and since you need it to attach the car charger to the unit, we couldn't do without it. The original unit has the suction cup part permanently attached to the charger adapter. With this new adapter, the suction cup part detaches from the adapter-plug part, making it easier to use in the car (we let the unit hang onto the dashboard ... the window mount makes the garmin difficult to use). I am very happy with this adapter."
2,Nuvi 660 Suction Mount,"This dash mount product design is not terribly robust. Mine broke within the first 3 months of use. Gramin replaced that at no charge under warranty. The new one has yet to arrive. In reviewing the design, the plastic tabs that clamp unto the knob are not very thick so I am anticipating that I will have to order several more over the life of the product and once the initial warranty expires. I remove my unit nightly and I am on the road 100+ nites per year. Love the GPS though."
4,Ok,"I got this as a replacement. The one that came with my Garmin broke after 2 monthes (Note: Garmin also sent a free replacement, but I was not sure it would come in time for our vacation so I ordered one as well - FYI Garmin knowing that I needed it fast was great and overnighted my replacement!!! WOOT!)Also we have had the new one for 3+ monthes and it is still ok."
2,GARMIN MOUNT- SO SO,"I had my window broken out of my truck and a magellan gps was stolen. I bought a garmin nuvi 660 to replace it, because i have garmin on my boat and have had pretty good luck with it. The mount is terrible, it melted to my window twice that is why I keep buying new ones. That way I can have then in each vehicle."
3,Ho Hum Martial action,This is the typical martial arts film. I bought it for the Eagle Fist action and got some but was not fully impressed with it all. just average.
2,Does not fit right,"I got these for a 72x18 inch tank and they do not fit and they sent it in three pieces, which was not labelled on the product description. I have no bracers on my tank so i had to make my own and even then the individual sections barely made it from bracer to bracer and they were actually like 70x17 all together. Also one the the handles on the section that lifts up was broken and i couldn't use it. i don't recommend unless you are buying from a store where you can see and measure the product"
1,AVOID THIS JUNK!!!,"Spent the better part of my weekend covering 18 windows. Followed instructions, prepared surface, did everything ""right."" Came home from work on Monday and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY 18 WINDOWS HAD SAGGING PLASTIC ON IT!!! The adhesive they use isn't sufficient to hold the tape in place as many other reviewers have stated--spend a little more and buy a quality product--THIS IS ABSOLUTE JUNK!!!"
1,piece of junk,The tape is the main and important part and after wasting 2 hours the whole thing starts comming apart. Piece of junk..Do not buy this product. Wonder why amazon carries it.
1,Tape Doesn't Stick,This was the only window insulation system available at lowes home improvement. The double sided tape does not stick to the window but does stick to the plastic. I will be trying another manufacturer in the future.
1,Tape works ok when warm but when cold it's junk,"The tape that is supplied is junk. I out in on the window sills then tried to apply the plastic. The tape sticks very well to itself but not to the plastic if cold. When warm it does ok. A cheaper brand I used preformed much better and at half the cost. In a nut shell overprices, cheap quality. Buy the cheaper brand.."
1,"Doesn't stick, no matter what you do","Plastic comes off the windows - I cleaned the frame before putting on the tape, tape stuck to frame, warmed the tape with hair dryer before adhering plastic, plastic comes off of tape over time - within 7 days every one of the 8 windows had come unstuck."
2,Go with the 3M product!,"I rarely buy things without researching online, but this time I did. I purchased this product impulsively , and now I am paying the price. The plastic is too narrow, the tape DOES NOT stick and I did not see any warnings or tips about removing the adhesive in the spring. I hope I haven't ruined the paint. For me the hardest part was getting the tape to stick, Buy 3M!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"This is the last year I buy junky Frost King brand window covers. Three reasons,1) they don't insulate well. The 3M ones my father uses in his house do a 10x better job than these.2) the tape isn't sticky enough and the drafts will peel the tape off. I had to use painter's tape to seal the cover on.3) they don't shrink hardly at all. The shrink rate is very minimal, so there is no real shielding effect. The 3M product seems to shrink twice as much.Don't waste your money on these, either here or at Home Desperate.I'll find a better product next year."
1,Adhesive inferior to previous years,Bottom line: The adhesive does not stick to the film OR window. The product is worthless. I have used this product in previous years and had success. It seems that this year they changed the adhesive to something far inferior. DO NOT BUY.
2,Tape not sticky enough!,"After reading the comments by other reviewers, I still decided to buy the Frost King product because it was the only brand offered at my local Lowes. Big mistake. They were right, the plastic does not stick to the tape. I've used both 3M and Frost King in the past and never had the same problem. Which makes me wonder, did they change something? Needless to say I will be returning and repurchasing another brand."
1,The tape does NOT work!,"The tape that comes with this is CRAP! And I didn't just get a bum roll, because I bought an extra roll, and that tape didn't stick either. You could barely tell what side was the sticky side (before removing the tape backing) and it didn't hold the film in place. I ended up having to use packing tape, which will leave one hell of a mess, but we're replacing the windows next summer anyway, so I won't have to do the clean up. It's very frustrating to put this much time into a project and have it fail so quickely."
2,Somewhat poor quality but not totally useless,"Yes, the tape doesn't stick too well, especially the outer layers of the roll. Also, separating the tape from the backing is a torturous process; I don't know if the other brands have come up with a way to do it better. The plastic is very hard to cut as well. However, I did manage to get the tape reasonably adhered (by firmly and continuously pressing on it) and the plastic stuck to it. I can honestly say that it seems to have worked. Because it's been such a mild winter, it's hard to say definitively, but on cold days it seems like the temperature in the room is a couple of degrees higher than it would have been without the plastic sheeting, and that means a lot to me in terms of comfort and fuel savings."
4,Good Product would buy again,"Overall I was very satisfied, it took longer than I thought and would have been easier if I had another person helping me, especially when I was cutting the shrink wrap (it is a big piece of material). All of the wringles come out very well, you just need to use the hair dryer for a long time. Make sure you apply insulation loosley, as it will shrink as you use the hair dryer and you might not have an air tight fit on the edges."
5,Great Product,"I have purchased these for all of my windows and they work great. I disagree with the negatives listed by other users. First, I had no issue with the folds not disappearing after heating. You cannot tell that there is any film on my windows. Second, I had an issue with the tape not sticking to one of my windows(I had no issue with the other five I used it on). This was remedied by a)wiping the perimeter of the window down; b)warming the surface I was putting the tape on with the hair dryer; and c)making sure I waited 15 minutes before peeling the paper off the tape and putting up the film(which is stated in the instructions)."
2,disappointed,"the plastic melted when i blew a blow drying to shrink it, the tape was difficult to adhere. the plastic barely fit."
1,False size advertising,"This package claims that it is is 62"" wide and will fit 10 standard windows. WRONG! I brought it home for my ""standard windows"" and the roll is too narrow! I don't know if the ""standard window size"" is just a myth but every window in my modest home and in all the homes I've ever been in are the typical 3-pane across 35-36"" window. Therefore I have wasted my time and money, hoping to seal my windows over the holiday break. This product is completely useless to cover any window I have. It would be useless to cover any window in any house in my neighborhood. I am sure Frost King makes wider sizes but the hardware store had only this, and clearly, I was excited to find 62"" wide plastic that would cover 10 windows! Don't be fooled."
1,VERY poor adhesive,"i have used Frost King for years, but won't use it again. The film WILL NOT STICK to the tape! It falls off even before I can get the hair dryer out.And I've even tried ""boning"" it down - nothing works.I'm taking it back to get some other brand. BOOOOOO"
1,2010 Tape is Bad/Weak.,Something is wrong with the 2010 batch of Frost King Tape (Home Depot). It barely holds the plastic and required several hard rubbings to get the plastic to stick. I had a two year old roll of Frost King tape that held much better than the 2010 batch. I'm afraid I'll be heading to the store to buy 3M tape after the first winter storm pops the plastic off the tape. Perhaps people complained about the difficulty of taking the tape off and they weakened the formulation. I switch between 3M and Frost King depending upon which retailer has either out faster. 3M is the best hands down if a bit pricey. IMHO it's worth it. Don't buy the Frost King this year and save yourself a lot of headaches.
2,horrible.,"i bought this today for my large window, the tape is horribly unsticky. i followed instructions, and when i tried to put the plastic film on, it did not stick at ALL. i figured maybe it was too cold, so i ran a blow dryer over the tape which made it feel a lttle more sticky. so i tried again, but the plastic STILL did not stick. fail. i am going with the 3M kit and buying extra tape to seal it. i will not buy this again."
4,JA Audio Nicely Done!!!,"These speakers were a purchase made after a lot of research. I didn't want to spend thousands of dollars but I wanted good sound also. These are a perfect match. I found the low end lacking - of course, but with a little low end added and a sub-woofer they sound great!!I saw the reviews that said they were not good or sounded bad. I found they had great stereo imaging and the ability to handle some power was really great. They sounded good loud and were clear, crisp and with the sub added they are perfect for home theater. I bought 4 pair for my 7.1 surround sound system. Very Nice!!!"
3,UUUUMMMMMMM whatever,"Package/card was beat up, toy was new, yes, but package/card looked like a package/card from walmarts welfair kids! Buyer should let you know of the package/card's condition!"
1,The worst drivel I've ever read,"Don't waste your money or your time! Although there are a few good pieces of advice, there is so much garbage interspersed that this book is painful to read! The very idea that painting your toenails can scare off men or being an IRS agent is a great job for meeting men is sheer nonsense. It's a shame that the author's few good ideas (such as taking good care of your mind and appearance) are corrupted with rediculous bad advice, which has the feeling of a 1950's ""manners for ladies"" review. If you are a woman who feels like part of this century, bypass this outdated drivel."
2,If you are desperate to marry him.....,"There are a bunch of tips in this book HOW TO MARRY THE MAN OF YOUR CHOICE. The book is filled with housewifish average ideas in how to land the man, especially if you are totally clue-less and have no phantasies of your own. It is mandatory for all of us females to realize, that HE has the conviction of immortality on his side, why rush into anything? That's why your best tip in this book: invite him to a meaningfull stroll through the cemetery! I bet you never thought of that one! Me neither! My suggestion would be, if he still doesn't get it, exchange him for an older guy. The book HOW TO KEEP HIM AFTER YOU LAND HIM still awaits to be written by a more skilled author than this one is."
1,"Oh, please! Spare me.","I could rehearse Kent's canned dialogue that balances the fine line between being a ""nag"" and a ""doormat,"" or I could get busy loving my fantastic man and making us both deliriously happy. When I found true love, I threw this rag in the trash."
1,Stick to the Rules,"I think this book must've been written when that whole feminist revolution was happening. Odd thing is, it is written in a completely degrading way for women. I was especially surprised how there was so much basic common sensical stuff like, ""don't look in his drawers and closets when you are at his house."" (duh!) I almost threw the book out the window when she says that you shouldn't make him wear a condom unless you are worried about sexual disease. When shouldn't you be worried about sexual disease? I know many women who have suceeded on the Rules concept, which is being your own person and loving yourself -- this book didn't quite get there."
3,its boring,i did try the technique of not wearing any rings and sometimes it worked. Although only with the elderly men and not with the younger generation
4,It works!,My mom bought this book as a gag gift for me one x-mas - and the next year (to her dismay) I found the perfect guy! - we've been married ten years this month! I am buying this again for a friend who thinks she's ready to get married. Good luck to all of you - this practical advice definately works!Ann Marie M. Andrews
2,Pass it by. ...No wonder it was in the clearance bin.,"Pros:-It gives you a general (very general) idea of what's in a guys mind and to use that to manipulate him all the way to the altar.-Lots of advice on sex.Cons:This chick is telling you that if a man hurts you (indicative of him not liking you), you still have to take it and beg for his forgiveness so that he doesn't turn to someone else.She thinks she knows how a man thinks.You gotta be careful with these types of dating books( even ones in general) because they attempt to analize a guy's mind. Sometimes they are right with a particular person/guy you're eyeing/dating but other times, it's wrong.She's also (for a girl) talks a lot about sex and how you can use sex to ""get a man"". Well you know what? Tried that, didn't work.Next.Recommendation: The idiot's guide to dating."
2,simply a bad book all together,"I bought this book with the expectation that I will learn something new or something valuable, something that will really enlighten me or teach me specific skills on how to ""marry the man of my choice""...not only did it fail my expectations, some of what she said in the books are just absurd, many of her bullet points (things to say, questions to ask etc.) are just no-brainers, I find this book of low intelligence (not on how she writes, but the things she write). I should've read customer's reviews before investing my money into buying this book."
4,It's What He Wants.,"There aren't that many books out there that are written by women on what the men want, instead of what the women think the men want. But here is one of them, and one of the best ones. She offers a lot of ideas to use that will attract more men your way. Yes, there are some things in here that don't make sense and may seem a bit too forward for shy women, nevertheless, it's what men like, and want from you. That's what counts. You don't have to agree with the whole book. I didn't, but it's still a must read, because it's what men want. I tell my customers to read this if they are looking for more good books to read. Perry Rose author of ""I Love You...Will You Marry Me?!"""
5,Love it!!!!,"Years ago I had purchased this book for myself, and was glad to find a copy that I could send to a friend of mine. I have applied what I learned from this book and it works! Very pleased."
1,This CD was never released. IT DOES NOT EXIST.,I ordered this CD a couple of years ago when Amazon announced it's release. I was very excited because the last of Ms. Phillips disco recordings were on Mercury and this CD had many of the songs on it. It never arrived. I waited and I waited and ordered and re ordered but was given refund after refund. I never understood why this CD was never available yet advertized. I was shocked when one person was able to obtain this CD and wrote a review on Amazon. I wonder where the reviewer got his copy. What a shame. I gave this CD one star only because I had to in order to submit a critique. One star for a CD that does not exist.
5,Great pads!,I got these pads and used them on a 04 toyota tacoma w/ a tundra caliper swaps (S13WE or 199m). They work great and I haven't had any problems with them yet.
5,Entertaining,My two year old son loves Oswald. Oswald teaching super lesson to the kids about life and friendship. Great show!
4,Plenty of shows to watch,"My son really likes Oswald, to bad their is only one season. Also the video quality seems a bit off at times, but I think it's how the show was created in the first place."
3,Quirky,"King of the Corner is quirky and cute. Reigert is funny, with some great quotes. The ensemble actors are also great, especially Rossellini and Johnson. Enjoyable film with many great scenes."
2,Vanity Film Falls Apart at the Seams,"Peter Reigert made a vanity film, which he wrote, directed and stars in. In case you don't know who he is, he's the guy who is not only IN every scene, but the center of every scene. No other characters are permitted to develop more than one or (maybe) two dimensions or interact with one another -- only with Reigert An outstanding cast that includes Eli Wallach, Isabella Rosellini, Rita Moreno and others is largely wasted in shallow, second-fiddle roles (although they are all solid pros who make what they can of the goofy lines they are given. Wallach particularly makes the most of his character).The story actually starts off reasonably well, but begins to fall apart about 40 minutes in, after which it devolves into a series of random, inexplicable scenes that show a lack of thought or planning. It's like an onion: one layer, upon another layer, upon another layer, and in the middle -- is nothing."
3,good budget sampling of Miss Bailey,"As far as song-stylists go, Pearl Bailey was in a league all by herself. She loved injecting elements of her own personality into every song she performed. Nothing was ever sung the same way twice, and her unique abilities are amply-showcased on this budget disc from Collectables.The bulk of the numbers here are taken from Bailey's early recording sessions with Mitchell Ayres and Tony Pastor's orchestras (""He Didn't Ask Me"", ""Protect Me"", ""Mamie is Mimi""). Broadway standards and jazz specialties are the order of the day for this great disc, with Bailey's trademark quips and comments spicing up the mix.Pearl Bailey enjoyed a great career in the jazz and supper-club scene; but also found fame on Broadway (starring in ""St. Louis Woman"", ""House of Flowers"", and ""Hello Dolly!""). This collection of classic Bailey tracks will be a delight for all her fans.[Collectables 8051]"
2,Hitler and Stalin: Roots of Evil,"I saw this program on the history Channel and loved it! I even taped it so I could use it as a resource to teach my high school history students. The VCR tape was starting to get old and the quality was deteriorating. I figured I would get it on DVD to replace it - boy was I wrong! This DVD has a dry, English accent narrator which was not on the American History Channel program. His voice is matter-of-fact, and not dramatic enough to keep you interested. After a while, it became like white noise, and all I was really watching was old black and white archival footage. It's amazing how the absence of a Hollywood voice has such an effect...I'm disappointed."
2,Tougher to use than the Ergo,I prefer the Ergo to this carrier for back carry's and heavier babies. Too many straps to figure out. I sold mine on Craigs List after a few uses.
3,BOSE Companion 3 Review,"I would rate this system as average to poor. The speakers provide ample bass but other frequencies sound cheap. It helps if you update your sound card drivers, experiment with plug-ins and equalizer settings if you use WinAmp but nevertheless, it's a major tweaking job. I may be too picky but I expected better sound quality for the price.The system looks good and the mouse-type volume control/mute/headphone jack/input jack is a good idea. Bottomline, don't buy this system if you're a perfectionist about sound reproduction."
3,Why won't volume fade out?,"We bought the BOSE Companion 3 speakers and were happy with the sound, but had to return them because, irritatingly, the sound (when connected to our ipod dock) would never fade out. So, basically, you're forced to mute or listen to a minimum volume that is more than a little too high for a New York appartment. We're a little incredulous that BOSE, for all its famed style and sound quality, wouldn't have noted this deal-killing flaw.... So we've returned them, very disappointed. Would have raved about the sound."
2,don't fall for the marketing,"These speakers are terrible. I assumed -- unwisely -- that given the Bose brand and high price tag, that the sound quality would be wonderful, or at least average. As the other reviewers have noted, the midrange on these speakers are terrible -- a full 1/3 of the sound is missing: e.g., background vocals are frequently inaudible.The industrial design is beautiful, and the interface is friendly, but not worth the extra cost. For audio purists and anyone who wants value for their money, you'd be better off with another speaker system."
2,Tinny Tinny Boom Boom,"If you want to blast your neighbors out of their skulls, this is the system for you. The bass thumps even at the lowest setting. Play it at a reasonably mellow low volume, and you'll notice how irritatingly tinny the satellite speakers are. People who complain, ""no highs no lows, must be Bose"" are dead wrong about this set. I say where is the mid range? Where's the mellow warm tones? I hate what this does to my music! Plus the speakers cut in and out. I'm sending it back."
2,Not worth the money,"These speakers, like other Bose products, sound amazing in the store but not so much at home. I even have a great sound card installed on my computer but these speakers still lack mid-range. They sound hollow and get distorted when turned up loud. The subwoofer volume controls the bass on the sub as well as the speakers. If you turn the sub down low, there's no base in the speakers. These would be great speakers for the casual music enthusiast but unfortunately they wouldn't be spending $250 on speakers."
1,Bose- low quality for high prices.,"Well, the time when BOSE name was associated with good sound came and gone. As for now it is company who sells crappy speakers for reach guys. In fact you can get the speaker s that sound much better for third of the price but they will not be such beautifully slick. For the price you can get pro sound from Samson, M-Audio, Fostex Alesis studio monitors. This set has bad everything. It has dirty bass, poor midrange (near not midrange) and flat and dull highs. Yes it is slick, but there's no sound.To have the sound you need the space where the sound could resonate, that's why people buy larger speakers with invertors. It is simple like that: no resonance - no sound!If you have the extra money to show off with BOSE brand buy those. But do not forget to save some money to buy a good speakers along to listen to music after your friends will read the label."
2,Buyer beware..,"Before you buy these listen to comparable product from Logitech, Klipsch, Altec Lansing and Cambridge Soundworks to name four. If this Bose product was priced around 100 bucks I would be a little more forgiving. It isn't though and the sound quality is shockingly bad. No highs, no lows (must be Bose!), not even a reasonably accurate midrange. Shame on the Bose corporation for marketing yet another overpriced, under performing product. I would encourage anyone in the market for a good pair of desktop speakers to listen to the brands I list at the top of this review. The quality of desktop speakers has risen to a very high level in the last couple of years. Amazingly, the Bose corporation's arrogance has once again produced yet another embarrasing product."
5,bangin speakers,"My roomie down the hall just got these speakers, and they were bangin. I got to say man, he looked psyched out, bangin some rap. I got to give big ups to bose on these bangin speakers."
5,the best sound for your money by far,"I culdn't have made a better buy for this amount of money. As of today I'm stll very satisfied with the great preformance that three speakers can provide. I can't belive that I waited so long to deside on buying this speaker system, which is quite pricy. But then again, Bose is the best way to go for those of us that can afford it. Overall the Companion 3 is a great buy. ---Sweet!!!!!!!!!---"
3,Long term performance degrades..,"I have been using this system for more than an year. I bought the system thinking that being a premium product should give me good performance over a period of time but I think that I was mistaken. To start with the system gave a very good sound output with good highs, deep lows and decent mid range. But over the period of time maybe due to the curing of the bass module it delivers an excessive bass taking over lot of mid range and highs.. I now have to keep the bass at the minimum level and adjust my equalizer settings to get the right mix.. I think there should have been something to adjust for the excess bass internally instead of keeping on readjusting the equalizer settings.. Overall decent,overpriced product but I doubt its longevity in terms of quality of output..."
5,Bose 3 Multimedia Companion 3,"I have just bought these speakers. I was looking for something to use in my flat for my ipod, and wanted something loud and good quality. I could not recomend this system more highly. The sound is perfect and the bass is almost too much. Much cheaper than the bose ipod dock at only 200 rather than 250. Yet it allows 2 sources and gives much better sound. The puck is beautifully made and works really well. To top it all, Bose have excellent customer service, it was quick and very polite, the lady I spoke to, knew exactly what she was talking about and I have every confidence that if something was to go wrong, I would be well looked after. In my opinion this is the best solution if you are looking for a small system to play music in a relatively small flat, I should think that I will never play it at the full output, as complaints will flood in. I hope that this gives any potential investor the confidence to buy one, it is great."
3,very worth your while,"Both these guys are strong performers, and these songs are pretty good examples of anglicized rnb, slightly hippified in places, a little corny maybe, but sharp too. ""Time I moved On"" is actually stunning, a beautiful ballad and a song that needs to be rescued from oblivion. All the rest are at least robust fun."
5,Great service and excellent price,"I don't know how they did it, but I've never paid less than $15 for this product. The price was so good I bought three boxes. I was worried the product would be old and dried up, bot that's not the case. I will definitely buy from this vendor again!"
2,Not a white stem...,"The picture shows the baton as having a white stem, but the one I received is wooden. The grip is a pretty color but the stem matches the walls in my band room and our gymatorium, so the students have a hard time seeing the baton. I need white!"
1,You probably don't need a new cutter / foil,"I've used a 3612 every day for the past 8 or 9 years. I'm using the original foil and cutter and it works just fine. The trick is simple - brush out the cutter and head EVERY time you use the shaver. The super-sharp edge comes off the cutter within a couple of weeks of use, after that the sharpness basically plateaus. If you keep it clean it won't jam up. Its the uneven pressure that causes the cutter to try to shave through the foil. I only had a foil cut through once and that was because I didn't snap the head on fully and tried to run the shaver - foil went in about 30 seconds.Now I DO need a new cleaning brush, as I've worn mine down!"
2,It's a replacement part. It's expensive. Oh well.,"If you have this shaver and you need a replacement blade, and if you don't feel like going out and getting a whole new shaver, you're stuck. I'm guessing that most people are buying this more for the foil than the blade. One problem with shavers with this kind of screen foil is that once in a while, the moving blade underneath cuts a hole in the foil. Unfortunately, this is a ""sudden failure"" event rather than a ""slow wear and tear"" event. This means that every day there's the same probability that you will end up back on Amazon ordering yet another replacement pack. It could be six to twelve months from now. It could be tomorrow.The replacement pack is what it is. If it's too annoying, switch to a whole other type of shaving system (electric or otherwise)."
2,braun brain,"My discouragement is simple. I ordered a product, and received a different model. The refund was simple enough, except after all this time, it hasn't happened. So it is about the service time at Goodmans that I am having trouble with. Trying to get ahold of them is no easier per their website. More attention to that portion of the site should be made more user friendly. As far as the product itself, yes it does what it says, and that is why I keep buying replacement cutters when needed."
2,Not worth the price,"Have owned shaver for years and like design. Tried to buy replacement shaver but can't find. The replacement pack came with the foil unattached to its housing at one corner. I was going to return it but decided to try to repair it myself-which I did. All-in-all, while the product works OK, it is overpriced for what you get."
2,Not satisfied,The product arrived in a timely manner but broke the second day after it was installed on the shaver. The pop up cutter won't retract and I actually have to keep it taped down when I don't use it. Darned inconvenient if you ask me.
1,Someone's gotta say it,"Is it possible that this book's been on sale for a year and a half and no one's read it? Or is everyone just too polite to call a trowel a trowel?No matter.Clum's manner of writing is excruciating, what he has to say isn't worth saying, and the rollercoaster swooping from on-high academia to leering and drooling over actors is nauseating.Perhaps the typo in Ted Chapin's book about Follies is not so off the mark: Thank you, John Crum(b)."
4,Always Fred,"Though not 2 of Fred's best. Fred is always the best. Vera Ellen was totally underated. She was one of the best dancers. Ballet, jazz, tap she could do it all, plus she got to dance with both Fred and Gene Kelly."
4,"Superb Wedding, disappointing Belle...","Royal Wedding is definitly a great film, with some top class dances and routines by Fred Astaire. I would'nt be so enthousiastic about the belle of New York, which lacks of dances. But Fred's charm operates, and makes this film worth watching, altough it's not his very best."
3,Is it real or is it Duveen?,"While this book is enormously entertaining, it's value is limited as a serious work of history. The reality is; Lord Duveen, grandson of a blacksmith from Delft, who went on to be an English Baron, was much more of a hustler than this 1950's era fantasy makes him out to be. For a more modern take on Lord Duveen try: Artful Partners: Bernard Berenson and Joseph Duveen by Colin Simpson."
3,"sadly, this is just okay","I've had the pleasure of seeing both the Melvins and Fantomas in concert and this is not a great representation of what either band sounds like live. Okay, it's not really either band. Okay, it's done for fun but it's just sooo medicore. It's mildly entertaining but not engrossing. Most of it sounds like soundclips from longer pieces of music. Perhaps the entire concert should have been released?I wasn't a huge fan of ""Director's Cut"" when it first came out and I gave it a bad review. It has since grown on me and I enjoy it quite a bit. If I was thinking of purchasing ""Monsterworks"" or ""Director's"" I'd definitely go for ""Director's"" and I'd also pick up the new Melvin's album, ""H.A.T."" It is one of the best things they've done in years. After getting both those albums then, and only then, would I buy this album."
2,"a couple good songs, but overall not impressive","This albums has two good songs ('Ol Black Stooges and Bit) but other than that this album isn't very impressive. Mike Patton's vocal range sounds very limited and often not in tune. His vocals are the least impressive part on this album.The only thing about this album that make it worth having are the 2 good songs, 'Ol Black Stooges and Bit. I was also disappointed that Chariot Choogle wasn't on this CD. I wish they had performed that song."
2,"Two bands, one disc, zero reasons to buy","Nah, I can't really get into this. I have a stack of Melvins CDs, a Fantomas disc or two, some Faith No More, and all that groovy loud stuff. So I had high hopes for this live album.But 90% of it is a noisy waste. I'm surprised that these guys decided to play weird death-metal jams while Mike Patton screams over top. I mean, they can all really play, so why just act like [that]on stage? What's the point?Sometimes I'll listen to this when I need a caffeine jolt of mindless aggression. It's like Ministry for nerds, with an extra hit of doofus humor and none of the discipline."
2,"Better luck next time, perhaps...","I was really looking forward to this CD after having seen Fantomas live and then Melvins live a few months later. Sadly, this effort to merge the two bands is a disappointment. The sound quality is bad and the ""tightness"" of the Fantomas songs just doesn't come accross with such a large ensemble. Stick to the studio albums - this is for die hards only. Although hearing Patton sing Hooch was cool!"
4,Just what we needed,The phones have been in use for one month now and we have no complaints. They have worked just fine and the instructions were easy to follow.
2,so so,For the money I think you could get a better phone. We have four in our office and no one is happy with them. Our line one works fine but two and three never do. The phone company blames the phones and the Panasonic blames the phone company. Big surprise huh?
2,Mediocre product,"I purchased 6 of these for my small office. They perform the function in a very basic way. I am disappointed they are not caller id capable. The sound quality is mediocre and inconsistent.Jan. 15th, 2013. UPDATE! I've now had these phone in my office for a year and I have to say I like them even less than before. The speakers stopped working entirely on several of the phones. One phone died and had to be thrown out. The old adage of you get what you pay for really applies this time."
1,none of them worked,"purchased 4 of them for my new medical office; unfortunately by the time I used them in my office, none worked properly! Be careful!Unfortunately, not many choices for 4-line phone in the market now"
3,Panasonic 4 line not so good,"I purchased 3 Panasonic 4 line phones thinking they will be a great replacement for my small business, but it turns out the phones keep flashing red when on hold so you can tell if the line is ringing or in use. I called support and they said that's how it is!! The other problem is that the phone start to Ecco while speaking to someone. Over all I'm not so happy and I have to look for a new set."
2,Panasonic phone,Bought four and all of them make a static sound whenever we use the speaker. Contacted Panasonic just could not figure out and they did not want to do anything as it was technically out of warranty in just a few months. Just got stuck now and will not recommend this product at all.
2,Now I'm looking for something better.,"Panasonic seems to have put a lot of energy into features and not much into quality. We have three KX-TS4100s and one KX-TS4300 that we bought for the voice mail.While they're a huge improvement over the IP system we struggled with for over a year (never again!), the Panasonics are not nearly as good as anything I was using twenty and thirty years ago.The handset sound quality is terrible: harsh, even painful to the ear. The problem is in the phones, not the transmission. My home phones, which get phone service from the same local phone company as my office, sound great.On the 4300, the caller ID (a frill because we want to get every call) and voice mail (a necessity because we want to get every call!) both died ugly deaths. Our outgoing message now just says: ""Call again during normal business hours,"" because we don't get messages anymore.We're shopping around now for a new system. NOT by Panasonic!Gr."
4,Good but not worth import price,"There are a lot of things to like about this album. It was electronic French music that didn't sound like air. It was an album that relied heavily on the keyboard and didn't sound like Mu-Ziq. Most shockingly though was that the band set out to make a My Bloody Valentine record and actually succeeded. To be fair, Loveless was a once in a lifetime accomplishment and Kevin Shields' masterpiece will never be replicated with a bunch of cheesy synths. Dead Cities won't have that album's indeffinate selflife, but given what their working with, its about as close as you're going to come."
4,Swathed in sound,"Gonzalez was never one to triumph completely in the compositional department alone, but M83's strength lied in the ability to augment simple synth work with breathy, layered production, making these relatively basic electronic renderings flow with extended grace."
3,nothing special,"Listening to this CD reminds me of Darla's bliss out releases from the 1990's. In light of Windy and Carl, Transient Waves, Orange Cake Mix, (et al.), and even Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here, I don't see the need to rave about this release.It's okay background music if you've got a term paper to write."
2,And this is getting hype because?,"Wow, what a disappointment. I had heard nothing but good things about M83, and about this disc in particular. After giving it a few spins, I admit that I have no idea why this thing got so much attention. It sounds like stoned sophomores playing with synthesizers. Nothing bad, but there's nothing here you haven't heard before - just Moogish ambient mmmmmm."
2,Adult fantasy long on description but short on imagination.,Clive Barker does a great job of making creative fantasy for adults but James Herbert's predictable sludge paced tale will put many adults asleep.After a stroke Thom returns to the manor he grew up in as a child only to discover masturbating fairies in the woods and a hairy succubus who really really wants his sperm.Herbert manages to describe everything from the tiniest leaf to what everyone is wearing but pays no attention to plot or pacing.The most memorable aspect of this book is the handful of admitedly erotic graphic sex scenes where Herbert uses descriptions to good effect...if this were a movie you would be pressing the fast forward button.Besides that it's disappointing and flat.
2,WORDY AND UN-ORIGINAL,"In truth, I did read the reviews for this book, but decided to take a chance and buy it anyway. By the time I got to page 40, I felt like I was back in a school--it became 'required' reading instead of pleasure reading. I considered it 'required' because I had paid my money for this book so I was 'required' to read the whole thing.Soft porn aside, the whole fairy journey was long, boring and unoriginal. The characters were stereotypical: the bad witch Nell vs. the good fairie Jennett. The good 'son' versus the 'bad' one, yada yada yada...Mr. Herbert has some really nice passages but they got bogged down with too many other passages. And the thing where he put explanations in parenthesis looked like footnotes to himself he didn't bother to work into the story. Disappointing."
3,ok nice.,"Ok nice story,worth reading good ideas with witches and magical creatures set in the modern era. Just not enough depth though."
2,"Things were going fairly well, until...","I really liked the first two-thirds of this book, but after that I was physically unable to finish. I really liked the character of Thom and savored his chemistry with Jennet (although it was a bit creepy that the love interest is described as so childlike). The quiet parts where the two are exploring the forest and talking while Nell was off being wicked are the book's best feature. But once the romantic tension was resolved and Nell looked to be turning into a generic villian, I lost interest. It was disappointing to see a story that started out detailing unseen worlds of wonder devolve into a typical Good vs. Evil climax. Just when the book should have been roping me in, it lost me, and I've been unable to finish reading it for over a year."
2,"so bad, it's almost scary","What was James Herbert thinking? This novel is part fantasy, part horror and with a chunk of soft porn thrown in as well. And none of it works. For a big book, there seems very little in it and you engage with none of the characters.Disabled guy goes to live in cottage, falls in love with fairy, battles bad witch. The end (except for a rather terrible and unlikely suggestion at the end where it went all sloppy and mentioned sick children and changing the world).James Herbert has been off his form for a while now and this is a clear step backwards. Best avoided."
3,"Not bad, not great","This is not one of Herbert's best, although not too bad. Harry Shannon's novel ""Night of the Beast"" handles a similar theme in a more driving, potent manner.Once is fine to add to your Herbert collection but not worth going out of the way for IMHO"
3,"Solid, but could have been much better!!!","Definitely an entertaining read with a very cool idea and some interesting characters. The main problem for me was the over the top sex scenes. Sometimes I felt like I was reading porn, and not a thriller/horror story. I could have done without the graphic sex. I also wanted to read more about the fairy world - how they came about, Jennet's story, etc...All in all, a good book that kept me entertained and interested!"
3,"A bit too predictable, raunchy and pseudo-philosophical...","Herbert's prose is easy to get through. The scope of events in the book is fairly complex, enough to titillate many readers. His descriptions are convincing, if not somewhat over-laboured. Unfortunately, there is an element of predictability and a certain lack of suspense... He reveals each character's motivations far too early in the novel... there are no red herrings or diversions whatsoever. While the protagonist is interesting enough, the other characters seemed somewhat shallow.And all those raunchy sexual encounters wich undines, hellhagges and fat, ogre-like succubi really detracted from the quality of the novel. Lastly, the pseudo-philosophical, New-Age theme that pervaded the whole book really stunk."
4,Of historical interest,"S.K. Niazi's The Omega Connection was published in 1987, so now it's mostly of historical significance. It was one of the first general trade books to include a discussion of the intracellular hormones called eicosanoids.Eicosanoids are created from specific Omega 3 and Omega 6 fats that the human body can't produce. They must be obtained from dietary sources.In this book, Niazi claims that an imbalance in eicosanoids, caused by a dietary oversupply of Omega 6 fats and a dietary undersupply of Omega 3 fats, are the root cause of modern chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and many others.It's now 20 years later. Scientific evidence that this is exactly a primary cause of our continuing levels of chronic disease has continued to come in. But in general most doctors don't yet accept this hypothesis. Don't be surprised if your doctor has never even heard of eicosanoids (eye - co - sanoids)."
5,"Well written, interesting, kept my attention.","I originally read the book because I happened to work for the author, and as such have a personalized copy. However, it is well written. Great story line, kept my attention through the whole book. I too was surprised at the ending and never saw it coming. I can't wait to read his next book.It was also nice to see Ann Arbor, MI as the basis for a book as opposed to the standard, New York, LA, Chicago, DC, etc..."
3,Channel Vision Coaxial Tap Splitter - 6DB Line Tap - 2 Way,"I bought this tap to replace a 9dB PDI ""Mega Tap"".Unfortunately with this splitter installed the SNR on my cable modem, installed on the -6dB leg, swings wildly by at least 4dB (38 to 34). Before with the PDI tap the SNR was very stable and higher (38.8 to 39). A back and forth comparison today confirmed these results.I think the advertised attenuation values are pretty close. I was at about 8dBmV with the -6 tap and now 5dBmV back on the PDI tap."
4,Good Book for kids,I got this book for my 19month old.. She likes the book and finds it very funny.. I does help her we are starting the potty training and she will grab the book and run to my husband and I and say mommy daddy potty book and will not give up till you read it to her so its a good book..
1,This book is terrible,"My daughter received this book on her 2nd birthday from a friend who has 2 children she has potty trained so my husband and I were hopeful that we would have the same success with this book. NO SUCH LUCK. 1st of all, the ""wee wee"" ""poo poo"" terminology seems a bit odd to us. 2nd of all, the potty looks like a flower pot or pitcher of some sort, not anything like the baby bjorn potty we bought. In fact, while reading the book to our child for the 1st time we got to the picture of the ""poo poo"" in the bowl, she got all excited and yelled ""ice cream mommy"". Lastly, the explanation of the genitals is way overboard for a child this age. We got the baby doll that wets, hopefully it'll give us better results."
3,because of soft paper recommended for kids who are trained very late,"The drawing of the potty looks weird. It doesn't remind of the shape of the potty but that is not why I am not able to use it. My daughter is 16 months and that is the age when they still want to chew on books. Soft paper makes it impossible for us. She needs a book with all hard paper pages. The pictures are okay, even the way the potty looks could be acceptable but the paper....so anyway- if you can get that book in different paper go ahead or if you train your child late otherwise i do not recomment it"
2,Kind of annoying to read...illustrations not that great,"I totally disagree that this book flows well (it 's actually very annoying to read, especially since you have to say ""I, Prudence's Mother,..."" about four times). But I do agree with the other reviewers who said the potty looks nothing like a child's potty. So unless you want to train your child to urinate in a flower vase or lemonade pitcher, it might be best to choose something else. I really like ""The Potty Book"" by Alyssa Satin Capucilli, and my daughter prefers it to ""Prudence"" as well."
1,What a terrible book!,"We were anxious to get all sorts of potty training books for my daughter and this was well known so we got it. I cannot express how much I dislike this book. The only way I can get through it is to read it in an English Accent to amuse myself. My daughter likes it ok but I just can't stand it. I have hidden it from her so I never have to read it again. The language is not accurate (wee wee and poo poo), repetitive (not in a good way) and the pictures don't accurately portray current potty seats at all. Run don't walk to find other books!"
1,not so good,my 2 year old just didn't like the book. she didn't stay interested in it at all. it was not helpful for us. it had too many words to read - maybe if you had a older child but for my young one it's just too long
1,Don't like it,It is way too expensive for what you pay for. The video is very short and I can't stand that they call it Wee Wee and Poo Poo.
1,Great if it were still the 40's!,"This may have been a good book back in 1980 when it was written but I think even then it was outdated!The DVD and VCR tape are the same, don't be fooled by the release date.In the book, dvd etc. the little girl who wears cloth diapers..., bends over to show her bum hole. Her grandmother gives her a potty?? It looks like an nice pitcher to make lemonaide in. Very unrealistic in this day and age. She then walks around naked, poops and pees on the floor next to the ""pitcher"", and then the next day she poops and pees in the so called potty, yay she's all trained....right. They also call it wee wee and poo poo.....I don't know about you but I call it pee and poop or pee pee and stinky's.lolDon't waste your money on this outdated poop so to speak. Children need more up to date potty videos and books with there favorite tv charaters like Blue or Bear in the Big Blue House Etc. Elmo would be a good one."
2,"Poor language, not interesting","I just bought this for my daughter to help spark an interest in potty training. This book is boring, in it's word use, and illustrations. The language used is also strange: ""we we"" for the urethral opening, and ""hole"" for the anal opening. It just sounds odd to me. My daughter and I love ""The Potty Book for Girls"". It's much more interesting, and langualge use is more acceptable (to me anyway)."
3,ok,"This book is ok. I wish I had just bought her the video. The potty in the book looks different than ours and my daughter thinks the girl in the book is using a flower pot to go potty in. It's a cute book, but doesn't really help in the process of potty-training."
3,"Cute for story time, will not potty train your child","This book is fun, but if you are looking for a book to magically potty train your kid, I am afraid this was not the reality for us or anyone we know. Patience and persistence is key, reading a book did not seem to help."
5,"A great book about potty training with excellent, simple illustrations","My 19-month-old daughter loves this book, and we read it 2-3 times a day while she sits on the potty. I don't usually read the words to her, but I explain the illustrations. The pictures are simple and perfect for a young toddler to understand. The book sends the message that the potty is the place to pee/poop without being overly cute or pushy. I would highly recommend this book at the beginning of potty training."
4,Great Addition to the Video,"My daughter loves the Once Upon a Potty Video but likes looking at the pictures of this book even more. It's a great learning aid and is indeed a cute story of how Prudence goes from learning to use a potty, to becoming a proudly potty-trained little girl!"
5,I CRIED!,"This book was so beautiful! I laughed, I cried! I love this book! I totally reccomend it! I still read it to this day! Every night before I go to bed. (It helps me remember to wipe when I'm done!) :`) < I CRIED! My name is BOTTAY BUTTE"
5,~~THIS IS A FUNNY BOOK~~,"this book is a very funny book for 2 year olds to 102 year olds, me being a 12 year old girl thought it to be hillarious and had to get it for my neice she absolutly LOVED this book and i think it is a great book that shows the real fact!!!"
2,Let's reinforce gender differences from the start,"It's great that little girls who are being potty trained are learning that they have a 'pee pee' and all, but what the heck is a 'pee pee' anyway? I always thought that 'pee pee' comes out of a 'wee wee' and not the other way around.I was originally intrigued that there were both 'boy' and 'girl' books...is their anatomy so different that they need different books? Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books. It's nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too...blue for boys, pink and purple for girls. Maybe the chamber pot style toilets in the book actually exist in a spanish speaking country somewhere...maybe...."
2,Must like word choice,"The book is cute, but you need to be sure you want to use the words ""wee wee"" for pee pee. If not, this book is not for you."
3,too many words,"I was looking for something to help my daughter understand more about using the potty but the author apparently wasn't thinking about the age of the child being read to. The phrasing in here is too much & more complicated than other books I've seen. My daughter, 20 mo, doesn't seem too interested she likes everyone poops better."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is too long, not age appropriate and is annoying to read. The pictures aren't really age appropriate for a young child (perhaps it would be better if you had an older child you were trying to potty train - but I doubt it). The only thing my daughter enjoys is looking for the pages with poopoo on them. Don't waste your money on this one. There are many other cute potty training books out there. I just bought the sesame street one and my daughter loves it and I don't mind reading it."
4,A shocking page,"I would have given it 5 stars except for the page that gives a part by part look at a girl's body, and has her bent over so you can see where the poo-poo comes out. Strange!!! I mean, it's illustrated and not a photo or anything like that, and it makes sense why it's there, but it still caught us off guard. It made Daddy very uncomfortable when he was reading it to our daughter."
2,Not impressed,"After hearing so much about ""Once Upon a Potty"" , I was thrilled when my daughter received the book and audiocassette for a Christmas gift. After reading the book and listening to the tape, I was disappointed. The lanuage was very infantile (although you are encouraged to substitute your own words for urination and defacation). The potty that was pictured looked like a ceramic pitcher which could cause confusion to children exposed to ceramic plant holders. My 23 month old daughter was not interested in this particular book on toilet learning, although she loves others. If you buy it I hope you like it more than I did."
1,down with baby talk,"This book is awful. Unless you want your child refering to her body parts as 'pee-pee' and saying things like 'wee-wee' and 'poo-poo' stay away from this book! Babies and children would not talk like this if adults did not teach them to! People who do so should hang their heads in shame. Teach your children the correct names for their body parts and they wont grow up so repressed. I couldn't even donate this book to charity for fear soome unsuspecting person might buy it, first I let my youngest use it as a teather and then I pitched it! (...)"
4,Potty or pitcher?.,"My daughter loves the bright colors and images in the book. Unfortunately, the ""potty"" looks more like a pitcher, and not anything like her potty. The dvd that goes with the book has a better looking potty than the book does. It's also a long read, and the word for vagina and urine are a little different from what my daughter knows. The book says the vagina is a pee pee and the urine is wee wee. I call her urine pee pee and her vagina is just that. My personal preference. The dvd is the same way, though."
3,helpful book,This book was helpful in teaching my almost two year old what the potty was for. She loved the book.
5,Great potty book,I think this is a very cute book to help toddlers learn to use the potty. My daughter is 18 months old and already is showing interest in the potty thanks to this book.
3,A little too sophisticated for a young toddler,"I was looking for a book that I could read to my 1.5 year old, but this is way too advanced."
5,Everybody on the potty!,"""Once Upon a Potty,"" by Alona Frankel, is a fun book for small children and their caregivers. The book tells the story of Prudence, a little girl who has gotten a new potty, and is learning how to use it.The book is full of bright, friendly illustrations. There are explicit depictions of body parts, urine, and excrement: this enhances the educational value of the book, in my opinion. There are a number of nice touches, like the pretty flower pattern of the mom's dress.Although I have only seen the ""girl"" version of the book, I understand there is also a ""boy"" version. ""Once Upon a Potty"" is a good book for families going through toilet training, but would also make a nice light-hearted gift for anybody."
5,My daughter loved this,"My daughter had the vhs tape, book and a Prudence doll with her own potty. This is a wonderful tool for helping children understand the concept. Also, it seemed that my daughter related to it as well. She'd read the book and place her prudence doll on the potty as she sat on the potty herself. Additionally, she LOVED the video. Especially the end where all of the children sang the potty song.Great product."
1,Needs update,"Although my daughters used this book for potty training, it needs to be updated. Carrying the potty around the house for use - ugh! Book received in a timely fashion and in great condition."
2,Confusing to target audience,"If you want your child to think a pitcher or mug is a potty, this book is perfect. (Really. Husband used a pitcher with a handle as a vase... child said, ""A potty for me!"") While I like some of the concepts of this book (telling kids where pee and poop come out of), I can't envision ever reading the real text (or a child listening to it), and as some reviewers point out, there is no hand-washing... but I can make up my own story. I can't redraw the ""potty"" that looks like a mug or pitcher. (First time we read the book and our child saw the picture of poop in the ""potty""--which looks like a mug--she said, ""That's silly!"" Then the episode of her thinking the pitcher is a potty... not working for me!) I do give 2 stars instead of 1 since my child has some (limited) interest in it. ""A Potty for Me,"" with lift-the-flap pages and a more modern-looking potty, is not perfect but much more useful for us than this one."
4,Great Book to Introduce the idea of potty-training,"My daughter is a little over 2, and our pediatrician recommended this book to us at our 2 year annual checkup. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and ""the pee pee book"" is now her favorite. She is starting to understand the concept."
2,"Toddler loves it. Me, not so much.","To be fair, my 2 1/2 year old is currently obsessed with this book. If rating was based on her requests to read, it would be a 5-star. However, I don't love the illustrations and I find the book awkwardly phrased (text like ""and I, Prudence's mother, kept changing her"" doesn't roll off my tongue). I read to my children A LOT and I never rephrase as heavily as I do for this book. In short, I dislike reading this book and I think that potty books require enthusiasm from child and parent to work well. I'd suggest ""Potty"" by Leslie Patricelli instead. It does a better job communicating with concrete pictures and it feels more modern."
1,Dragon Floormats,I was very disappointed with this item. Within a month and a half the decal started peeling. When the weather got cold the backing became stiff and brittle. Very poor quality.
4,Sea glass review,I was told by a friend about the book and bought it so I could have a keepsake for the glass I collect.
1,unhappy!,i guess i had a different prospective of this item. thought it had more to do with the ocean not rocks. this book is for my daughter who loves the NC oceans. she had to move to Ky and misses the ocean very much. i thought this item would give her some fond memories. i'm not sure if this item will be an enjoyment to her or not.
5,Pure Sea Glass Book,I was pleased with the condition of the book when I received it. It was almost like new. Will certainly order more books.
5,Pure Sea Glass,"If you're a sea glass collector, this is the definitive book for you. It's chuck full of wonderful history and vital information and the photography is breathtaking. I personally keep referring back to the book time and time again...especially the two pages covering Sorting Sea Glass Colors By Rarity. It would make a wonderful Christmas Gift for someone special on your gift giving list."
4,A Different Take on Sea Glass than Most,"Fills in some of the gaps in identifying sea glass and pottery shards. Though the variables are tremendously wide, this volume has caught the practical side of these whimsies!!"
5,"Love Sea Glass, You'll love this book","If you love sea glass, you will love this book. Although it's filled with photos, it is also loaded with information with great examples of colors of sea glass, help on what it could have originally been and dating the glass. Beautiful and informative. This one sill stay on my coffee table and be read and read again."
5,Sea Glass celebration,What a supurb book! Terrific illustrations and interesting. A must read for any beach comber.
5,Pure Sea Glass,"This is a lovely coffee table book that is amazingly beautiful as well as informative. I have recently started collecting beach glass and I learned so much about the various colors, how rare each is and where the glass might have come from. I highly recommend this book to any beach glass collector."
5,Very Nice!,Bought this item to go with my underwater camera. Very nice compact unit fits in with my camera. Batteries stay charged for a good time and its easy just to plug it into a wall outlet and let it go. Would recommend this item.
5,great for therapeutics class and for pharmacy practice,"This is a great book, easy to read and follow. Concise enough where you can read it fast but with enough background information so the drug therapy makes sense. You will get a thorough understanding on what drugs are used and why. Picks up on the key points a pharmacist needs to know in practice and a student or someone who is studying for the boards needs to know for exams. Flowcharts are great, has JNC-VI guidelines which are the standard when it comes to drug therapy and pharmaceutical care. Overall, a great book that will enhance your understanding by leaps and bounds."
2,May be ok if I can figure out how to put it together,"I am so frustrated. I unboxed the cage and had to tear up the box to get it out, can't return it. Finally found the instructions which are just a very simple picture - doesn't even show all the parts, tell what tools I need, or anything like that. Very discouraged at this point. Is there anybody out there that has put one of these together that can give me some guidance? What are the little metal bars with a curve on the end and where do they go?"
5,Highly recommended!,"The blurb is right--I could not put WOLF'S CUB down. I found this medieval world completely believable, and I rapidly became attached to the characters, especially the hero, Herric. He is everything a fantasy hero should be, but deeply human, too. The climax is heart-pounding, moving, and real. This is the best kind of fantasy because, while it's an epic adventure, resonant with dangerous magic, subtle intrigue, and age-old prophecies, it reflects our world's joys and difficulties, and what it says feels true. I guess this is a small publishing house, and that's too bad, because WOLF'S CUB will get less attention that way, and it deserves a LOT. This is a fabulous read. Buy it. You'll be glad you did."
5,Pure Genius!!,"Once you purchase Paper Boys, you should budget a day or so, clear your schedule, take the phone off the hook and hang a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door. This book WILL weld you to your seat and demand that you sit up and pay attention.Paper Boys will take you from the innocence of childhood to the horrors of war, and keep you laughing and thinking the whole time.Every human being on Earth should own this book!"
4,Great Piece,Item seems to very well made and provides a good cost for what you are buying.Easy to hook up and put on bike had no problems.
5,Good cd,Tracks...1. Intro2. Still Smashin'3. What It Do?4. Murder Show5. Mack Swagga6. Twerk That7. Rock Da Party -(aaaah!)8. Who U Wit?9. 4 All My10. Westcoast11. Material Love12. Wild Boyz13. Grown-n-sexy14. Pretty Black Girl15. Hypnotic16. Lets Go17. Move Mami18. Domestic Violence19. Top Down
3,MY LIFE IN TOONS,"An inspiring book for any student of animation, as the author details his life building a huge cartoon empire. Hanna/Barbera went from producing 40 mins a year to 2 and a half hours per week in the matter of afew years..an amazing achievement in any mans language. The book does falter however and reminds me of teh cover picture of Joe barbera ( resplendant in what looks like dyed hair,. a face lift and capped teeth. ) I think a more ""warts and all "" approach would have been far more interesting.."
5,Should be required reading for anyone facing this choice.,"As a birthmother myself, I wish I had had this entire series of pocket guides when I was making the decision whether or not to place my child for adoption. Brenda Romanchik writes clearly and helpfully about all the things you need to consider if you're facing this choice. Items covered include the definition of open adoption, private vs. agency adoption, your responsibilities as an expectant parent considering adoption, your legal rights, points to remember, important questions to ask, and resources for further investigation. I hope every potential birthparent finds and reads this booklet."
4,Lovelock is a bit wordy but a good read,"Lovelock's adventure into the theory of Gaia is an interesting experience that is worth the read. I found his ideas to be well constructed and factually backed up. It definently helps in providing a new way of looking at not only the earth, but also science in general. The only drawback was that sometimes he seemed to be more concerned with trying to denounce his critics than actually providing interesting and constructive opinions."
5,Breathtaking art; fresh take on an old story,"I am not sure what the fellow who found the artwork in Testament ""rushed"" is talking about. His feedback almost made me not purchase this book, but I am ecstatic that I did. In my 34 years, I've not seen a more breathtaking graphic novel than this one. Page after page of stunning, lush visuals - deep, challenging artwork that draws you in. This is not the cheap, flashy artwork of today's disposable comics. This book is a visual feast. I bought the book expecting to be underwhelmed by the story and the artwork - I bought ""Samson"" by the same publisher, and it was lacking. But this is the finest collection of graphic art in my collection.The story is fairly well-told, with some fresh ideas, but is mostly a breezy way to tie all the stories of the Old Testament together. That in itself is a worthy goal, and it is pretty successful. But the real selling point for this book is the art. You will not be disappointed."
3,Really small in size,My bad for not checking dimensions before ordering. I wrongly assummed it would be the size of mine and all I have seen in stores. It is about half the size and looks silly in proportion to the pole it's mounted upon.
3,Not quite what I expected,"I just began a career in auto sales. While Brem is a pretty good motivational writer and certainly innovative in the industry, the ""secrets"" are really not secrets at all. As a woman, I bought it to learn about auto sales as seen through the eyes of a woman. I know that the book is meant for both men and women, but I didn't get much from it. Maybe for a man, or a woman who was less experienced in sales in general might get more out of it."
5,Parental Life Saver,Wonderful video that will keep the kids enthralled whileparents do the things that they really need to do. Parents with down time will also enjoy this no stress video.Can be seen again and again with no loss of childhood wonder and fun.I have passed the 15 year old video to young nephews and nieces. Im purchasing this new set of DVD for them to share the joy again
5,"I love toy trains, parts 1-3","My son loved this DVD and he has learned a lot about trains; we have learned a lot about trains along with himWe liked the information, the music and the humor"
3,My toddler has low standards,"I give this a 3 out of 5 because my toddler, at 20 months, is totally enraptured by this DVD, and it is the first one he has ever actively requested (""Choo choo! Choo choo!""). It is also rather absorbing for adults, because many of the setups are really stunning and just plain cool and it makes me actually want to have my own train set.My toddler also loves the interjections of cows, ducks, and pigs, for while he has no ability to follow the punny jokes they're telling, those are his favorite animals.That being said, the production quality is more like a one- or two-star value. The sound quality is horrendous whenever there is a voiceover; some songs are extremely poorly reproduced; and there is a lot of reused footage. I wonder if the later videos are better quality?"
4,Retrospective,"Like candy, this video is satisfying without being really nourishing. It presents several famous and entertaining bits from Monty Python's Flying Circus, bookended in a throwaway narration by Steve Martin, in an attempt to showcase a full retrospective of the artists' ouevre. It debuted in 1989 at the Aspen Comedy Arts Festival, and was probably quite entertaining, especially since all six members of the group were together there for the last time.Thus, if you want a brief retrospective of several high points of the series, this video may be for you. It doesn't have every piece ever run, but it has enough to be worth it. However, now that the entire run of the show has been released on VHS and DVD, this video may be simply needless. Buy yourself the full series and get ALL the jokes, not a chosen few."
2,not what I hoped for,"It's ok, but not what I was hoping for. Lots of chanting, which I like in some amounts and settings, but seems like overkill here. Of course, I'm not Native American, so the effect may be totally lost on me...."
3,"A fine edition, but I didn't care for the translation","There's nothing wrong with The Pilgrim's Progress in Modern English, but I have ultimately decided I don't care for this particular modern translation. Contrary to other reviewers I thought the translation differed from the original far more than necessary and often verged on paraphrase. I am now reading Pilgrims Progress: The Accurate Revised Text which I much prefer. It is ""revised"" only to the minimum extent necessary to render archaic words and grammar easier to read but otherwise is much closer to a word-for-word translation than ""P.P In Modern English."""
5,A Pilgrim's Report,"This book seems to tell Christian's complete story.When I read it I find verses come to mind that I haveread. I think I should put in my own footnotes. The good characters in it will give you wisdom for your journey, and the bad ones will convict you of sin or make you laugh."
5,A few thoughts from a non- Christian reader,"Perhaps it makes no sense to talk about Pilgrims Progress without talking about the Christian faith which is at its heart and is its subject and purpose. But if I for a moment, bracket the question of a specific Christian faith and read the book as I have read it as a kind of story of a single individual in his quest for salvation I find it deeply meaningful and moving. To go from the Slough of Despond to contend with the evils of one's own lusts and forbidden desires to seek a way out of the Hell and suffering one has been in, and find a new road in life is something people of all religious traditions can know. The obvious sincerity and great depth of faith of the Pilgrim are inspiring. And many of the obstacles he must contend with all people in one way or another know. I found this story and allegory a moving one even though I cannot say I understood it all fully.Is it possible that one who is not a Christian can enjoy and learn from Pilgrim's Progress?"
5,WoW,"I've never read a novel quite like this before, absolutely challenges me to think about the straight and narrow path. Correlates with biblical scripture and brings alive the journey of life."
5,A great read!,"I remember seeing this book in my grandparents' home back in the '50's. Always thought it was about Plymouth Rock until I started attending church and found out it was an allegory on the Christian's walk with Christ. I really like the language of this particular book as it makes clear the different stages of the Christian walk. I was not aware of the second part about Christiana, which was thoroughly enjoyable as well. Definitely a keeper."
5,A must have !,"Amongst all other books regarding true to life spiritual experience and walk with God, this book ranks as one of the highest in regard. A must read and have !!!!"
5,Pilgrim's Progress,"Love this book, have read it many times in various forms. The pictures are lovely, and easy to read in modern English"
5,Truly one of the best books of all time,"Many years ago I read the ""original"" version and thoroughly enjoyed it. This Modern English version is even better because it's easier to read and comprehend, although I have to admit I missed the ""Slough of Despond"" (now the Swamp of Despondency).Bunyan has depicted the major pitfalls in the life of the ""born again"" Christian in an understandable and believable way. Especially helpful are the footnotes which allow the reader to refer to the Scripture passages Bunyan has used to support his allegory.If you are already traveling in ""The Way,"" read this book for encouragement on your journey. If you are not already a Pilgrim, read this book to find out what you are missing and how to enter at the narrow gate."
3,News: First Draft,"The debut album from Huey Lewis and The News is a typical first effort; an attempt to capture a band live in the studio. This is The News before the polish ofSports, and playing what would have been labeled ""pub rock"" had they come from Manchester UK instead of Marin County CA. The songs are short and punchy and the harmonies tight, clues of the greatness that would soon come from the band.The album, however, lacks the finesse that made their greatest hits so memorable. ""Some of My Lies Are True"" shows all the hallmarks of the band's strengths, a tight combination of pop/rock and r'n'b, enough to have made it a minor hit. The energetic ""Trouble In Paradise"" also shows what progress did to Huey Lewis and The News. Compare the spare sounding version here to the fleshed out one that the band donated toWe Are The World: U.S.A For Africaalbum (and appears on their ""Greatest Hits""). Good stuff, but they evolved into much better the years went on."
2,Not that good,"The other reviews for this record have me puzzled. This is the band's first effort and worst. If you are or just becoming a big Huey Lewis and The News fan, I urge you to by this cd for your collection. Otherwise there isn't much on here that stands out. ""Now here's you"" and ""Trouble in Paradise"" are good tunes, but most of the songs are mediocre. The album itself sounds unclear and the band seems to rush through most of the tracks."
3,Self titled debut,"If just starting a Huey Lewis and the News CD collection, this is not the one to start with. However, if you are already a fan it is a must have. This album, originally released in 1980, was recorded in a very short time and has a very raw sound as a result. Not many bells and whistles, just straight ahead ""garage style"" rock and roll.But in the midst of this first effort are some diamonds in the rough. The lead off song, Some of My Lies are True, made it on the track list of an oversees Greatest Hits release. And the song Trouble in Paradise was later featured on the USA for Africa benefit album.For the average fan this is not what I would recommend as a starting point for Huey Lewis and the News music. But it is a noteworthy album for anyone with a deeper interest in this band."
3,Great as a text,"If you're looking for an 'accounting' of Celtic Myths and Legends this is a great book with with a table of pronunciation, a great index for quick reference and an appendix of other recommended books. It is,however, very dry reading.If you judge the book by the description on the back of the book:""The romance of Celtic legend is unsurpassed, but many people have only a vague knowledge of the myths and legends of Britain's inhabitants. In this fascinating book, Charles Squire gives an astonishing account of the colourful Celtic characters who are part of the heritage of Great Britain.""The words fascinating, astonishing and colourful all make promises that the book can't keep.I think that Myths and Legends would be much more accesible to the common man if told by a master storyteller that can grab and hold your attention, this book comes across as an academic study."
4,Good overview with some stretching...,"Although slightly outdated (the book was first publised in 1905), this book still provides a good overview of the major players in Irish and British mythology. The few flaws the book contains derive mainly from the author's need to show that every myth has parallels in other cultures (wittness the ""Irish Illiad"")This approach does lead to some stretching, at least on the part of the reader; I, personally, lack the linguistic background to find the author's claim that Nimue and Vivian are both direct derrivations of Rhiannon obvious, and he offers no background or proof. However, he provides some wonderful insight into the sources of myths that still permeate our culture, and for that reason alone this book is worth reading."
2,"stale and boring, albeit authoritative","I wonder why it is that Dover insists on resurrecting these centenarian ""classics"" that reek from the profoundest nadirs of Victorian/Edwardian writing. The material, while bursting at the seams from its completeness and thoroughness of research, is presented in a most unappetizing manner. The author must circumlocute almost forever until he gets down to brass tacks, and--when he finally embarks on the meat of some myth or other--you have to read hard between the lines to torture the actual story line out of the narrative. There's got to be a better way to bone up on the rudiments of Celtic myth, and I think I've found it: ""Druids, Gods and Heroes"" by Anne Ross, likewise e-available at Amazon. You'd do well to avoid Squire and books of that ilk. Dover tries so very hard to deliver quality stuff, and they very often do, but Squire is *not* a shining example of their success in that direction."
5,The most in-depth study of Indian art with 383 illustrations,"Stuart Cary Welch is THE acknowledged expert on Indian art. This is probably the best and most important introduction to the subject. There are nearly 200 colour pages and the text is informative without presuming too much knowledge in the reader. There is a good glossary and index plus selected bibliography for each chapter which deals with art from each selected period. I so badly wanted this book to add to my Moghul/Rajastan book collection that I ordered it directly from Mapin Publishing Pvt, Ahmedabad, India. They shipped it + 2 others airmail to Australia without charging me the full postage. This book should be on EVERYONE'S coffee table because it's beautiful and enlightening and stimulating and gorgeous and, well, just THE BEST BOOK on Indian art"
5,Beautiful catalog,"This is the catalog from one of the Metropolitan Museum's (New York) first huge cultural overview exhibits, and it is very thorough. I had a copy that was damaged, and was thrilled to be able to replace it."
3,Noel - with not much of Charles Aznavour,"I am not much on childrens' choirs, and bought this mainly for the Aznavour participation. Unfortunately, he is only on the final carol. Having said that, the singing is better than many other boys choir CDs I have heard, so I'm not really sorry I bought it. But anyone looking for an Aznavour Christmas CD needs to look further. This is not it."
1,Delonghi has no support network,Delonghi makes a great mixer but what happens when it breaks? Mine broke (motor) and it has been a year ordeal so far. Delonghi relies on service centers with limited experience and bad customer service (probably the cheapest). Go for a brand with an established service network or you will end up with a big beautiful paperweight.
4,"DeLonghi DSM5 5-Quart Stand Mixer, Stainless Steel","This is a very good mixer. It does well mixing heavy cookie and bread dough. Also if you have ever made divinity, its an arm saver. I would recommend this product. Its easy to clean and it looks great on the counter."
5,Things went too well,Being a sceptic I was concerned about purchases on line. Everything went just fine. We received it promptly and we love the mixer.
3,Non Stick finish peels,"Great Mixer, BUT, the non stick finish on the flat beater and dough hook started peeling off (BAD) within 2 uses! Delonghi would NOT respond to numerous inquiries about replacements. I got the run around for MONTHS. They would take information then say they would call back. Did this NUMEROUS times. It's been almost 2 years now with it just sitting. So, I have the choice....either BUY replacements, or sell what has become a boat anchor. Basically, if you can live with the ""I don't care"" customer service from this company and are fortunate enough not to have a problem, then I'd say buy it."
4,Pharcyde Minus One,"That should be the real title of this album. Though the three remaining members hold their own lyrically, and the in house prodution is decent, one can only wonder just how tight a full L.P. WITH fatlip would be. The first song ""pain"" tells the story of sucess and failure, which pharcyde knows well with label problems and in group quarrels. But the song is truly a stamp of perseverance in their struggle. We can only hope this quartet can join back together and show the hip-hop game what hip-hop is. Until then, we're stuck with an incomplete e.p. and a fatlip album with little promise."
4,Coulda been more,"Just like THE RIDA from Detroit, I've been waiting since 95 for another Pharcyde album. While this EP is not as great as the other albums it does suffice for the true Pharcyde fans. While these guys may be average mc's they still continue to have some of the flyist beats in the business. Track 4 is definitely the tightest one on the album."
4,Great little adapter kit,"I bought this adapter set during a layover at the Hong Kong airport. I got completely ripped off ($45!!!) - but I needed to use my computer, and what choice did I have? Aside from the ridiculous price I paid, this adapter kit has been great. I've used throughout Asia and Europe, for over two years, with nary a problem. With combinations of the three pieces, you can adapt virtually any plug to any outlet, and when not in use, it tucks away into a nice, light, easy to use and hard to lose package.Note that it is NOT a transformer, only an adapter. Most computer power transformers work fine on both 120 and 220 volts, but for other types of appliances, be sure they are rated for the current of whatever country you happen to be in, before using an adapter such as this one."
5,Real smart,"I bought this for my trip overseas and this has been an amazing product. Not only is it a space saver but also tight fit with my computer power cord, hair dryer and travel cooker. Also, this is reasonably priced compared to the ones available on the planes. Before you take your overseas travel, make sure you have one of this. Great buy and great help!!!"
5,Great and nifty,Perfect for travelers or settlers from European or Asian countries; lets the appliances talk American and lets American appliances transform to Europeans standards:PNo regrets and highly recommended!
2,Nice Picture - Sometimes,"This TV has a nice picture on any analog inputs. If I use my DSS through the cable input the picture is great. However, if I use it through the S-Video Input at times of high motion the TV can't decode the signal fast enough. The result is a bunch of blocks on your 50"" screen. Pretty irritating to spend $1500 on a TV and see blocks as the signal quality! It is a super obvious problem with any S-Video or Component input source. I am not at all satisified with this product!"
1,Decorative Item Only,"I purchased this colander approximately a year ago. In that time, the metal lip around both rims has rusted, and the paint has flaked. I always handwashed and dried it. Unless you're planning to put fruit in it or hang it on a wall or do something other than that for which it was intended, I would pass on this. A waste of money."
4,Excellent review...,"As a second year PA student, the CD provided gives a great review for our ""blocks"". It does have questionable answers without explanations yes...but that is where personal research will solidify probing questions. I think it is a great tool to utilize since it has so many questions included in the CD. When I only have a few hours to fit in a good review, this is where I turn! The book is also well compartmentalized. Would buy again."
2,Ok but not the best,"Buyers beware that this is not MAC compatible, so the CD ROM is basically uselesss to you...I have found it useful as coaster. Otherwise, the book itself is ok. It highlights the important points but you need CMDT with it. The cd rom really should be MAC compatible...I mean, cmon, it's 2007!!! Get with the program, LWW."
2,a good start,"This review is a good start for the PANCE, but it has some short-comings and flaws. The CD-ROM that comes with it is full of errors so be careful. If you are a first-time-PANCE-taker, use this as a supplement to other reviews."
1,The Plank,The movie is fine - but unfortunately I didn't notice that it was VHS - just assumed it was DVD...I don't fancy buying a $350 machine to record it to DVD...
5,I loved the ending,"This is one of my favorite series' of all time. Stefanos is a wonderful character- tall, dark, handsome and truly evil but reformed through the power of love. Some of the other revewiers did not like the ending, but I thought it was perfect. I am a sucker for a HEA type ending. I thought it was very clever of the author to wrap things up so neatly in the way she did. For me this was a satisfying ending to one of the most romantic fantasy books ever! Please read this series- you will not regret it."
3,Novel Ideas but Went on Too Long,"I started reading this series in 1992 when I found the second book in a shop in Vancouver. Annoyingly I could never find any of the others, despite searching extensively, so I was very glad to complete my series with these reprinted editions.The story of the series is a novel twist on an age old love story. Much like a fantasy world Romeo and Juliet, this story follows a lady from the light and the lord of the dark whom she loves, and who loves her. It is a powerful story.However, this was also a series that went on too long. It would probably have worked better as a trilogy, and consequently I found the story slow - particularly in the last two books.It was not terrible though. It was still readable, and the ending wrapped things up in a satisfactory manner. It may have pondered a little, but as a story it got there in the end.All in all this was an enjoyable read, but my feelings about the series would have been enhanced had I never read the missing books!"
4,Rect Spot Sprinkler AWESOME,I really like this product. It creates a nice wide pattern and is perfect for trees that are new and bushes and garden areas.
1,RECHARGEABLE AIR COMPRESSOR,"One of my biggest disappointments in Amazon purchases. This is the closest I have ever come to sending something back.It arrived when expected and was packaged well.It never held a charge long enough to pump up a low tire. I replaced a Campbell Hausfeld unit that I have used for years. That unit was so reliable, I kept it in the trunk to use whenever a tire was low. I destroyed that one by leaving it running when I went into the house to make a phone call. It overheated and died; I guess I was lucky it didn't burst my tire!!"
1,Piece of junk,"It sounds like a good product, doesn't it? Just a little more than any other air compressor, but it has it's own battery and light. Unfortunately, I though the same thing, and bought it. The first one was acting strange from the day I got it, but it took a couple months (of just sitting around) before it completely failed. I mailed it in, and got a new on in return. The new one seemed to be working fine for a while, but after using it 2 or 3 times, it simply wouldn't start. The warranty period has expired (it's not an item you use frequently) so I can't get it replaced. The unit is designed so that it can't run while plugged-in, so when the charger or the battery dies, the whole unit is trash. You can get a better no-name air compressor for $10 at your local car-parts store."
1,They've said it all!,The previous reviews have touched on everything about this piece of junk. The gauge is totally off and the switch broke after a few uses. It wouldn't fill my truck tires at all. Fortunately I got my money back from Pep Boys. Avoid this product.
1,Dead in 2 months,* Bad Compressor *I bought mine from the Coleman store expecting their past good quality. It has been two months. I have probably inflated about 100 soccer balls with it. It just froze up. Then it blew the fuse. Replaced fuse. Same thing again. I called customer service and was redirected. That is when it became clear that this is NOT really a Coleman product. The fine print results in spending another $20 or so to get it repaired or replaced with a refurb. I'm buying something else instead.
1,"Hate to add salt to the injuries, but","I am actually commenting on a similar model. Also is a Coleman powermate rechargeable jumpstart with inflator, light, etc. It looks fine and solid. However, it doesn't last at all. After using the inflator a few times (less than 10 times to be exact), the inflator made strange noise and quit inflating. Very disappointed on Coleman products. I haven't got any chance to use the jumpstart function yet. Just like other reviewers, it really hurt me when such a big brand name makes such a crappy product. Sad."
5,Good purchase,I bought this cd for a song that is very rare to find. I'm so happy that this cd had other song's I liked as well.
3,"Ehhhhh, not too bad, not too good....","Being the biggest fan of Layne Staley, I was hoping for alot more from this book. I understand from reading this, it isnt easy to write too much on him, because he basically was very sheltered and private. I just though there was alot in this book that was just page fillers. There was alot of info that frankly had nothing to do with Layne at all, and lost my interest quite a bit. However, there was some good stuff too, and it was cool just to read some his letters and poems. I didnt learn all that nuch I already didnt know, except for his family life. If your a huge fan, I guess its worth the read, if not, you'll probably throw the book away."
1,Grasping at Straws,"I was horribly disappointed in this book. I feel the author had great intentions in putting this together, but given the bands lack of participation in interviewing, this book has nothing to it. Half of it is pictures or other inserts with little insight to the heart and soul of Layne Staley. I found it to be quite boring with little substance. In fact, on page 57, the author discusses the single written for the last action hero soundtrack ""What the Hell Have I?"" Only problem is, the author calls the song ""What the Hell I Have?"" I find that to be a problem. If I were writing a book about a celebrity, I would make sure I got the names of songs correct. This book is nothing more than an overhyped disappointment."
3,"Interesting details, mediocre writing (2.5 stars)","I appluase the author for taking on this task of writing a book on Layne Staley. While her heart was in the right place, I don't think her writing abilities backed up the book. She sidetracked too often and wrote some things that seemed unrelated to or rather insignificant to Layne's story, such as things about Kurt Cobain (if I wanted to read about him, I would've bought another book), her physical condition, how she put the book together or some lyrics from some other journalist that wrote songs about AIC. The interviews with Layne's mom and sister were very good on the other hand. They seemd truly heartfelt and authentic. I also enjoyed all the pictures from early on and some writings, drawings and other cool snippets (like ads Layne put up looking for work or promoting his band) in the book. Overall it's got some good info, I just hope the author does a better job on her next project and improves her style!"
3,poorly written,"I feel that this book is inadequately written she places herself too much in the lime light and writes as if she was a member of layne's family. I feel that it was written under delusional connection to the 'soul' of layne. After a while her tone gets to be irritating paralleling his work to the renascence era and going into detail of the drug culture drawing a parallel to her anorexia and layne's heroin addiction. I can say from the standpoint of being a writer, singer and artist myself that if someone were to write a book about me in this fashion I would be greatly upset. I feel that it has done a disservice to layne and his family to be written in such a presumptuous tone. However, the book does contain good information, artwork, and quotes and must be read with a massive grain of salt."
3,It could have been great.........,"Well, as a huge AIC fan I have been waiting for this book since August of '01, when I pre-odered it from the books web site. And now that it is here after a few delays, I would be willing to wait a little longer for a more polished product. At times I couldnt determine if I was reading Layne Staley's biography or a essay on my humanities class from college. The author at times also had me confused on the timeline on events in Staleys life. What was nice is that the author was honestly in my opinion trying to tell Layne's tragic story without giving us fans the yellow tabliod crap we are used to regarding stories about Staley. A quick read, and if your a fan I would say go ahead and buy the book. Dont expect a masterpiece, just a decent story about a very talented man who destroyed himself slowly over the last 8 years."
2,For true fans only,"This is a book you should purchase if you want to take a look at some of the private artworks, poems or photographs of Layne Staley, the 'great late' leadsinger of Alice in Chains. But: it's written by a fan who wants to be in the picture herself. Adriana Rubio is obviously very proud to have had intimate conversations with Staleys mom and sister, and it shows throughout the whole book. Everybody shall know that she has this overwhelming respect for Staley's relatives and their stories. Also, I got the impression that she wrote this book to get rid of her own complexes, comparing Staleys heroin-addiction to her own struggle with Anorexia Nervosa. She places herself too much in front, which is quite irritating after a while. Or, in the words of Layne Staley: ""She should write a book about herself"". Still, there is the telephoneconversation with Layne Staley and her that is quite shocking for the true fan. I'm still reading the book so now and then, about a year after buying it."
2,Where is the beef?,"A lot was left out of this book. I am note sure if Layne wanted it that way, the family wanted it that way or if the author did not dig hard enough. Layne was reported to have another live in girlfriend the last 5 years of his life. Kids are even rumored.A lot of this was left out. The book said Layne never left, that is not true. The book glorifies his mom - Layne really had mixed feelings and what kind of a mother doesn't check on her son for two weeks. This seems odd. Adriana is a terrible writer. She writes about her own problems and disects Laynes lyrics. We dont really learns anything more about Layne than what little we already dont know. She should did around Seattle more.... there is a lot of skeltons in that community."
2,Layne deserves much better,"Layne Staley was an amazing artist and man. He was never given the credit due him. I have been in contact with his mother Nancy and she is in the process of putting together a book in honor and memory of Layne. He deserves a much better book written in honor of him, his life, his talent and the mark he has left on this world. Go Nancy!! And I have been given the great honor of having a poem I wrote especially for Layne published in this new book his Mom is putting together. I'm sure it will be something Layne Staley fans will love. Cheers and prayers to you Layne!"
1,Angry Chair: Possibly the Worst Book I've Ever Read,"Instead of writing a detailed and intellingent explanation of why this book is absolutely horrible, I will simply provide a list of superior ""Rock Bios"" with great hope of providing anyone who wasted their time reading this piece of junk with some meaningful studies of the creation of music and the development of artistry, and with greater hope that the so-called author of this ""book"", Adriana Rubio, will take the time to read something worthwhile and, by the grace of God, learn something that will prevent any further disgrace not only to the fans of the subject she might choose, but, to the writing world as a whole.1. 5 Against 1: The Pearl Jam Story, by Kim Neely2. Dark Star: An Oral Biography of Jerry Garcia, by Robert Greenfield3. Midnight Riders: The Story of the Allman Brothers Band, by Scott Freeman4. The Phish Book, by Richard Gehr and Phish5. Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana, by Micheal Azerrad"
2,Should have been better,This book was very poorly written. The author gets way off track talking about herself and the Renaissance period. The only things saving this book are the stories told by Layne's mother and sister and the photographs. This book should have been better. The author should have focused more on Layne and less on herself. There is so much more I want to know about Layne and the author just barely scratches the surface.
1,What a waste.,"I feel sorry for anyone who has already wasted the hour it takes to read this miserably written so-called book. Poorly written, uniformative and incoherent best describe this sorry piece of work. Save yourself the money and just listen to some of the great music Layne, Jerry and the guys made over the years."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I worked two hours to purchase this book.I wasted an afternoon of my life reading it.This book could have been about 10 pages long.136 pieces of paper were wasted on this book.This muck barely deserves space on a webpage, letalone an entire book.Read something else, don't waste your time friend."
3,good book,now i waited a long time for this book to come out and to be honsist it was not bad at all althoug she does go off track about layen and start talking about herion which is dumb on here part but other wise it was a good book.
1,poorly written with almost no insight into Layne Staley,"A few times while reading this book I had to tell myself that I was not reading a 5th grade book report. The writing is that bad. There is no information about Layne since he was basically a recluse for the final months/years of his life. So all you get are tales from his mother and sister from his childhood like how he liked to play with legos.(literally) Lots of big print, pictures, and other fillers allowed me to read this in about an hour. Desperate to fill space, the author even allowed John Brandon, who wrote a book on AIC bassist Mike Starr, to print songs he wrote as a tribute to Layne in the book. That was probably the funniest part. Completely a waste of good trees."
1,shame on( -5 stars),"actually,my friend purchased this book,so I've read it.yeah,I agree--this book isnt for any AIC or\and Layne fan.previous reviewers did good job judjing this misunderstanding.by the way-the author of this book is going to fix ""some"" mistakes with ""Layne Staley:Get born again"".she says there will be more pics of Layne,more interviews(+last Layne's interv) etc.who knows,maybee second attempt will be succesfull?i dont know,will see.but something tells me,that things wont change.don't buy this ""book""."
2,This book is basically a waste and a disappointment!!!,"I just wanted to say that after waiting so long to buy this book, I was completely disappointed after reading it, which only took a day, because of its length. The book is not true to its decription.....""a look inside the heart and soul of an incredible musician."" Adriana basically based the book on letters and phone conversations with Layne's mother. She really didn't even know him herself. She had no right to write a book about someone she did not know. Sorry to say it, Adriana, but you need to stick to writing on subjects you know about. To everyone thinking of buying this book, don't. Believe me, you will be disappointed!"
2,I Just wasted $...,"Please do not make the same mistake I made. If you care about AIC, you're not going to learn much more from this book. This author is a Wack Job who wastes 1/2 of the book talking about herself and her opionions rather than any factual information. Trust me, not worth your money, time or effort."
1,Really bad,"This was the only Layne book out so I bought it hoping to find out more about the interesting and mysterious Layne Staley, instead I found out about the writer and her life story. It sucked. Don't buy it unless you want to hear about the writer."
5,Twilight of the Renegades - another Webb masterpiece,"This is an absolutely wonderful album. Somehow Jimmy continues to write masterpieces. This is as good as anything he's done. Unfortunately, we won't hear much about these songs until someone records them and makes hits of them."
3,Iris Folding: Techniques for Papercrafters,Some nice ideas and patterns. I expected a bit more from the book.
3,Mystery of the Glowing Eye,"In the story Mystery of the glowing Eye made by Carolyn G. Keene there is only 1 real main character.As you see in the title she is Nancy Drew.Nancy is a lively type girl that loves helping her dad with mysteries. She has 4 friends that help her with the mysteries named Burt, Bess, Dave,and George.In this story Nancy is tring to find out who kidnapped her boyfriend Ned.Through the story they find many things. They even found out who took Ned which was Zapp Crosson. Her and her gang even found 3 hide outs where Ned was held captive.At the end of the story Ned runs away in a Helicopter and get's to see Nancy at long last.If your wondering this whole story takes place in a town called Elmsford.The whole idea of this story is (what I think) is to always be careful when your alone or elae something bad might just happen to you.I think this is a great book and for the people that like mysterious stories should read it"
3,Mystery of the Glowing Eye By Sara Dihel,"In the story Mystery of the glowing Eye made by Carolyn G.

2,"Great movie, poor DVD","Originally a very good movie, but the DVD is poorly edited, the sound track was awful, barely understandable at times."
3,"Pretty Bad, but has ZASU, SPIKE & BILLIE","Pretty gawd awful script and it is in DESPERATE need of a digital remastering BUT it has adorable stars of the era...BILLIE BURKE, ZASU PITTS & SPIKE JONES"
3,not up to the hype,"I bought this book, in fact- after reading a couple of reviews. But I'm a little perplexed by the descriptions of this novel as ""hip"" and ""trendy."" I was expecting something a bit more along the lines of Bridget Jones in a mystery format from the descriptions, but in fact the protagonist Lily is on the pedantic side, and unless listening to Radiohead is the sole qualifyer, she didn't seem very hip at all for a twentysomething. She comes across as a thinks-she-knows-it-all, and the mystery plot wasn't all that well executed. There are too many inconsistencies, and although the setting is nicely done and the writing isn't bad, there are far better hip young Brit sleuths out there.Try Lauren Henderson or Liz Evans, for example, or Sarah Lacey's File Under: series. Another good one is Anabel Donald's Notting Hill series- Alex is much more hip than Lily!"
2,fictional chain smoking,"Maybe I've become too sensitized to smoking, but I found the number of references to lighting cigarettes and smoking a total distraction, sometimes more than once on a page. Like dripping water or a tic, I couldn't concentrate on the plot for waiting for the next cigarette. I've noticed that this occurs occasionally, usually in first books, and it doesn't seem to me that it adds anything in the way of the plot and not even the character or the atmosphere (except that it's polluted)."
2,Wouldn't buy again.,"Lights are okay. Sleek, attractive. BUT, plastic covers are cheap looking and barely protect the lens. All of my lenses on both vehicles have cracked from road debris and the replacement glass on these is NOT easy to find."
3,Lots of Range; Little Depth,"I find this useful once in a great while. It does have a fabulous number of entries, but none of those entries are of encyclopedic depth. Labeling this a dictionary would be far more accurate. If you just want a quick ""Oh, that's' what it is!"" answer, this is a fairly good resource. I have to admit I found entries such as a profile of the person who developed ammonia-based refrigerants moderately interesting, but definitely not something I'd be looking up for food knowledge. There are some bad editorial decisions, such as using illustration space to show what dry-measure measuring cups might look like as opposed to showing what some of the more unusual food ingredients look like. This certainly is not up to college textbook level, however a student taking high school home economics cooking classes would probably find it very useful. Final verdict: Had I known the contents, I would not have purchased it."
1,It has only 1 picture out of every 2 pages.,"How can a book call itself ""Encyclopedia"" but it has only 1 picture out of every 2 pages? That means a lot of food mentioned in this book does not have an illustration!It also has basic errors. For example, it says a centimeter is 100 millimeters long. In fact, one centimeter is only 10 millimeters long. This makes the accuracy of the book questionable."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Morrison getting freaky again. There is some whackiness here reminiscent of Robert Anton Wilson. Secret agencies trying to keep consensual reality intact, porn star superhumans with semen weapons, crazy guys, split personalities, and old bachelor guys that live with cats.I don't think it is supposed to make sense, some of the time, either."
5,"Give a hand for ""The Filth""","There are some books that require more than one reading. Thomas Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow"" is such a book and The Filth is another. Read ""The Filth"" through once and then go back and read it again. Repeat twice more. Like ""Gravity's Rainbow"", when you ""get it"", it will knock your socks off. This book really raises the bar for the graphic novel genre."
2,Why this is a retarded comic series,"I read this comic hoping to see some intense new sequential art ideas. Such as non-parallelism or something else that would blow my mind. Instead I waded through page after page of bad art and crummy story line. Sure, perverted wheel chair ridden ex super heroes reading comics of alternate lives is a neat idea... If its done right. Sadly I feel that nothing in this comic is done ""right"" and its a complete waste of paper. It would of been a great read if the story was written well with solid characters rather then embellishing everything with neat little knick-knacks."
2,Great Visuals! Difficult to Understand....,"First of all, this review is based on what I got out of this graphic novel. I may be very dense and can't understand subtle humor of this nature. I found several parts of this humorous, but most of the time I was confused and lost in the story and where it was going and why it was going that route. Maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense and I just didn't get it. It any case, the art was, to say the least, incredible and visceral. I would definitely get another penned by this artist. But the story left me confused and somewhat disturbed."
2,"Yes, it's filth","This is the comic equivalent of a Troma film mixed with The Illuminatus Trilogy. The reviewers that loved it are correct about the content, I simply found it was not for me, it has a lot of ugliness without inspiring amusement.Actually, I can't really recommend this book to anyone except for fans of comics like Preacher, Hard Boiled and The Invisibles that *really* like to push the boundaries. I liked Transmetropolitan a lot and I was still very put-off by this. It's filthier.I would suggest you borrow this one from a friend and peruse it first. It truly is *not* for everyone. It's not smut, but it's close."
1,worst comic i have ever read,"utterly amazed that people like this, it was terrible!it is a work of surrealism, which i hate... if you like that i suppose it might be for you...but i was just blown away about how terrible, uninteresting it was. with no plot!horrible crap, waste of time"
3,"Good as far as it goes, but overrated","I bought this CD based on the reviews found here. While okay musically, the lyrics are mostly lacking: there is nothing new here, and much unthinking ranting against ""the system"" (without enough song-writing talent to compensate). If you like music in the vein of the Casualties or Blanks77, then you may find this is worth listening to if you've got the cash. But don't expect it to be as good as either of those bands, and not nearly as good as some of the more glowing reviews suggest."
4,Great software!!!!!,My daughter is 26 months old and she absolutely loves her learn through music. The microphone broke pretty easily because she carried the toy by it but other than that not too much to complain about. She learnt the words very quickly and thoroughly wnjoys the toy. I would not hesitiate to buy this toy again even if this one broke.
5,when the violins stopped playing,I Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was great to see the Romanies suffering acknowledged.I highly recommend this movie to others.
2,Dead pixels,"The fourth time I used it, dead pixels appeard on the dvd monitor, that really sucks!! Sound is really low, after all what esle can u expect for $200 .."
2,Not the best Nursing review,"This review for nclex is very confusing and all over the place.purchased this review to help with my nursing concepts exams,would not use to study for the nclex."
4,Planting Auger,Very good tool. It expedited the planting process. It did the job except in compacted soil where it bogged down a little.
3,works fine,"I bought this auger and use it in heavy clay. I won't call it 'soil' because in Portland, Oregon, it's just clay. ;-)The one issue is the auger has no bevels for the drill to sit on, so it's just a round shaft, which tends to slip unless you can really tighten the drill onto the shaft. My electric drill (cordless drills don't work for this in heavy clay) has only a hand tightenable chuck; no chuck key, so it's difficult to tighten enough in the hard, heavy stuff I'm trying to drill through.But sturdy enough for the job even down a couple of feet into the ground."
4,Works great and Saves Money,"I bought this for less than what I had been spending to rent a tiller each year. Now I can use this for years to come and it's already paid for. I've done my planting for this year and this little gem works great. It plows right into the ground without any trouble. I have even cut directly into the sod a couple of times just to see how it would handle it. It is sturdily built. I recommend a heavy duty drill if you are going to use it much, because a lightweight drill will overheat fairly quickly (but at no fault of this product). The one drawback to this product is the shaft is round where it inserts into the drill chuck, which means you really have to torque it down to prevent slippage. If this product had a hex head at the top for a better drill bite, I would give it five stars without question."
2,Didn't work for bulb planting; turns in drill,This auger bit is too rounded to be secure in the drill. It spun around and was useless in anything but loose garden soil. who needs an auger for loose garden soil?
4,I'm going to use it for my sales team,"Trying to grow our business, I was looking for a system or book that would help my sales team understand their clients better and focus on the relationship. I liked this book for two reasons. I enjoyed the beginning which focused on the sales person's emotional intelligence thru a few useful surveys. Know thyself right?. The second reason I liked this book was the study of client personalities. Very useful information on how to deal with certain types of clients. In summary, a very good tool to help your salesforce."
5,powerful imagery and sensuous language,"In his moving poems, Anthony Maulucci uses powerful imagery and sensuous language to create a rich immediacy of time and place. I love these poems."
1,bad,shipping is really fast and its good but the cd I bought wasnt good .. what Im trying to say is that half the tracks play and the other half dont .. but i guess that what i get for buying an used cd .. never will i do that again. this sucks balls cause now i have to get another one .. but not from here anymore thats for sure
1,PURE TRASH!!!,THIS MOVIE IS COMPLETE TRASH. I WATCHED AT THE THEATRES IN 1980 AND DIDN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND THOUGHT IT WAS OK. I BOUGHT IT ON TAPE WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED ON VHS IN 1990. PUT IT ON MY SHELF AND NEVER WATCHED IT UNTIL I FINISHED READING THE BOOK ON NEW YEARS DAY 2009. THEN A FEW DAYS LATER I FOUND IT ON MY SHELF AFTER BEING THERE FOR 19 YEARS AND THE FILM WAS PURE TRASH. VERY UGLY. GROSS SEX SCENES. VERY OFFENSIVE TO OLDER ADULTS ESPECIALLY SINCE CARROLL BAKER WAS 49 AT THE TIME AND ANTHONY FRANCIOSA WAS 52!!! MUSIC IN IT IS BORING DISCO. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY UGLY SCENERY. I WOULD CALL THIS COMING HOME TO A SEE A BUNCH OF PIGS RUN LOOKSE IN THE HOUSE AND A WHOLE WRECK. SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT BUY IT. DONT EVEN WATCH IT. THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN THE LEGENDARY CARROLL BAKER AND ANTHONY FRANCIOSA BETTER ROLES.
4,"Not Quite As Good As Volumes 1 and 2 Of This Series, But Still very Good","The is Volume 3 of a 3 volume collection of Freddy King's early to mid 1960s recordings for the Federal and King labels. It's very good material but not quite up there with Volume 1 and Volume 2 of this series.Since I've rated Volumes 1 and 2 as 5 stars, I'll rate this one as 4 stars. But don't let that put you off buying this; Freddy King was one of the great blues guitar players, as well as very good vocalist, so this is a worthwhile addition to any blues fan's collection."
2,Dry as Dust,"This is a very, very boring book to read, despite being well organised and set out. Admittedly the material isn't exactly scintillating, but a bit of effort to make the exercises even a little bit challenging would have been welcome. Also:- there are lots of errors in the sample multiple choice questions; and- some subject areas are not covered in enough depth (cursors, locking spring to mind).So you will need a supporting text to cover the areas that this text is weak on.I failed first sitting (solely on the text) and passed the second time (with the assistance of another textbook)."
2,"Good layout, no depth","I liked that this book models its chapters and sections to the list of exam objectives published by Microsoft. Because of this, the book provides a good starting point for studying for the test. However, almost all topics are skimmed, with basic brief examples. Supplement this book with another one (like SQL Server Secrets) to get the in-depth knowledge you need."
3,"nice try, but pay attention to errors","Kevin has made a nice attempt at taking all the objectives for the exam (from Microsoft) and then deconstructing each one. This is the approach I prefer, instead of the long-winded diatribes that disguise themselves as ""study guides"". However, one should be wary of the errors on the practice test. My colleagues and I found 17 out of some 160 questions (over 10%!) blatantly incorrect. But you can figure out these errors if you know the material (and check out SQL Books On-Line). Most of the mistakes in the book are misspellings and wrong headings or captions, again easy to figure out by just paying attention. Overall, the book is pretty good and the tests are decent but just know about the incorrect answers (I'll even fill you in on these if you want, email me at bobr_29@zdnetmail.com ). He would have got an extra * in my rating if he (or his editor) had spent more time on error correcting."
2,Don't try to take the exam with just this book as a resource,"Book is laid out well. However I agree with the other reviewers comments about the number of errors that abound in the book. Also this book did not help much in preparation for the exam. With some experience, the SQL Server Books Online and the Transcender tests you can expect to pass the exam."
2,"Far too many errors, but can be helpful guide","I agree with much of what has been said. This book canbe useful, and would actually be an excellent book if it were not for the errors in the book. (this may sound strange ""The book is good except for where it is wrong"") I like the structure and format of the book, and it is an easy read. If it were not for the technical errors I would rate it 5 stars. With the technical errors, I would say it can be a useful addition to your study efforts, but should NOT be your only source. Second Editions anyone? (Or even edition 1.01 would be nice)"
2,Don't rely on this book alone....,"Oh Yes, lots of errors. Bad ones too, It sure did switch the system and database catalogs, and lots more. But as one reviewer mentioned, cross check the details with Sql Server books online, then you'll pass with excellent score. The outline and objectives are right on what you need to know to pass. Just dont believe the details in this book however. Let the book guide you through the topics in SQL Server Books Online that you should know and it can be a good value and save you time. It is sad and surprising that so many errors and inaccuracies are allowed to be published and approved. Now we know where bugs come from, right from source material like this. Good intention, bad execution..."
4,Will help you pass,"I found this book adequate. I had very little SQL Server experience, but with the help of this book, I aced the test (I missed only one question). Of course, you have to supplement this book with the Transcender test and/or SQL server books online to do really well. Caveat: There are a significant number of errors (typos, incorrect answers) in the book, but they should be obvious."
1,The mediocrity level of this book is incredible,"I passed this exam but NO thanks to this book. I think I spent more time cross-checking the content with SQL Server books online for accuracy. I have some relational database background and so, could spot some of the blatant technical errors in the book. But I pity the freshers who rely on this book to get them thru the exam. Doing the practice tests was so frustrating since so many answers were wrong. Example: Which type of data integrity is ensured by using a primary key? Answer in the book: Referential Integrity. I can't believe it carries a label saying ""Microsoft Approved Study Guide""."
2,Not worth it.,"This book is very confusing, because there are a lot of technical errors, such as mislabeled diagrams, and blatantly incorrect information. NOT only that, but if you have Visual Basic 5 installed on your system, the practice tests on the CD crash due to DLL conflicts. This book is not worth the hassle of double checking information against other books, and having to search for testing material to practice on. I'm sorry I bought this book."
3,To the point (unfortunately sometimes the wrong one),I found the book well laid out - easy to follow and the author comes across well although a little impersonally (like reading a technical manual). How about a few quips or the odd joke to lighten the serious material. A few technical errors and incorrect answers were given but overall the book serves its purpose satisfactorily as a study guide.
2,"Maps nice to objects, but the content needs some major help","maps nice to objects; content needs some help This books does an excellent job at mapping Microsoft's objects to chapters and sections, no objective for the test is missed (THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT IN A STUDY GUIDE). However the authors text for each objective has about a 50 percent chance of being correct or relevant to the Microsoft objective in question (THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT IN A STUDY GUIDE!).I have not found a good way to study for this exam. I have taken the MS class, not enough info to pass the exam. Other good reference books, SQL Server Unleashed and the MOC, are just too big, and lack in certain areas.I would say get the transcender test (when is amazon going to sell these?), maybe get this book for objective coverage (or another study guide if one exists) and then a good reference book."
5,An old fashioned great for teen aged detectives.,"Edited by A. L. Furnam, and Illustrated by Gerald McCann, this book includes stories by Lee Priestley, Charlotte S. Hoffman, Seth Harmon, Patricia McCune, Florence Kerigan, and Kay Haugaard. The stories contain action, thrill and danger, and mental exercise in figuring out who the culprit may be."
5,REALLY WORKS!!!,"I highly recommend this product for any animal owner... in particular for helping to eliminate any odors for sick or dying pets... the product actually says that it is good for ""eradicating urine and dead bodies"" they are not kidding... nothing worse than cat urine... this product saved my couch and bedroom mattress from a very sick cat. Something everyone should have around their household."
5,anti icky poo arrived !!!,We have received the anti icky poo kit it tact at last!!! The original kit was damaged in shipment and returned to seller. Unfortunately the address of the package was ripped off. After a call a new kit was sent to me and arrived in perfect shape. The seller was very apologetic and knocked $10 off the price of shipping. He didn't have to do that. It wasn't his fault. I am very pleased! This is great stuff! The seller was very responsible.
5,Basie and classic.,Basically I dig them all. Your prices make it afforable to gather more music by various artists. Can't hear jazz on radio anymore like we used to. I used to work in radio and would spin the discs everyday. Thanks to you again. Bill Bigham Great pricing ......
1,She shouldn't be allowed to open her mouth...,"The comparison with Kenny G is right on. It's not that KG can't play; he simply has no imagination and neither does Brewer, and unfortionately Brewer has no chops, her voice in nasaly, and she belongs in the same category as Lawrence Welk, not Duke Ellington. Brewe demonstrates her stiffness and what I find to be highly unswwingable. Heck brewer couldn't swing if you hung her. And, in my estimation, she also has her cheezy pop style . Ah, well, life is made bearable through the unexpected interuptions of differing opinions."
3,Pretty Disappointed.,"This game was way too easy and short. I had this game for three days and beat it already. There wasn't much of a challenge to the game at all--which was ok, because then I didn't get stuck anywhere--but it was a little too easy. The real problem I had with this game is that it only took me about ten hours to complete it. The ending was sudden and abrupt. I thought that I was about half-way through the game--but then it ended. In my opinion, for $25 or $30, the game should last a while."
4,It looks good,"I think this game looks very good. The graphics aren't too bad, and the storyline is awesome. A must-have fore rpg players!"
5,Christmas present,Uncle was very happy with his gift. He wears camo all the time as he's an avid hunter and fisherman and he had worn out his other camo sweatshirt and liked his new one way better as it was lined and warm.
3,Could have been so much better,"Gilles Villeneuve has been accredited as one of the fastest natural drivers of all time. I was looking forward to seeing a video solely dedicated to this emotive charger, who always gave 100% whether he was in the lead, or down in the midfield ranks. What fans of Gilles would like to see is race footage of the man himself, given that the video is approximately 70 minutes in duration, it would have been good to see highlights of all his 6 victories, but also early drives for the McLaren team in before he switched to Ferrari in 1978. Personally I felt that there was too much time spent on interviewing other drivers and team members asking them what they thought of Gilles as a driver - to see this man in action speaks for itself. As is stands though this is the only ""Gilles Villeneuve"" video in circulation that I know of, so it is still a must have for die-hard fans, such as myself!"
5,Simply Southern,I have read Cappy Hall Rearick's writing in newspaper columns for years and have always found them very humorous. I was happy to see that she has put some of the funniest in a collection in a book. She is a worthy sucessor to Erma Bombeck and Paula Wall as a writer of American humor. I really enjoy her writing and I usually do not read anything that is pure humor. I have told a lot of my friends to read it.
5,Great narrative for solo dramatic interpretation,"After reading this book this morning, I had a vision of one of our youth at church performing this book as a dramatic interpretation. What an excellent, fresh view of the Easter Story!"
5,Great CD!,I own all three of Corey Brooks CD's and I have to say that by far this is my favorite. His first release 'Real Man' is already climbing up the charts. His music is such a blessing in my lives and he also has a great influence to the youth today. They need to see a young man out there doing the Lord's work. I highly recommened this CD for your CD collection.
1,Don't buy,"If you are a woman and want this for protection,this product will not work when you need it most,buyer beware"
2,"Scooby Doo, ""Where's My Mummy""",There is no way to tell if this DVD is any good or not because it skipped constantly and there was no way to follow what was going on in the movie.
3,"Not too scary, good for ages 5+","In my babysitting years, lots of little boys loved watching Scooby Doo. The only trouble came at bedtime, when imaginations run rampant in the dark and dancing shadows. Scooby Doo in Where's My Mummy keeps the scare factor to a minimum. The mild creepiness and lots of action combine well to keep kids interested. The only downside to this movie is the overly simplistic dialogue. It will bore most adults, including grown-up fans of Scooby Doo."
4,Very Good Scooby Movie,"One of the overall better Scooby movies, up there with Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost. It has good writing and good jokes; and, it's set in Egypt with mummies!"
4,Good clean cartoon,I have always enjoyed Scooby Doo when growing up and now I want to buy something good and wholesome for my grandson. We received it before Halloween and watched it. He enjoyed it and so did I. I probably will buy more in the future.
5,Scooby-Doo in Egypt,"Scooby and the gang travel to Egypt to join Velma, who is helping the royalty there restore native treasures. When a treasure hunter crashes the party, the ghost of Cleopatra is raised and she's not happy about her tomb being defiled. During all this, the host of an annoying TV show is also on hand to film the restoration of the treasures and succeeds in being even more annoying.This is another in the new series of animated Scooby-Doo movies and you'll want to add it to your collection. It appeals to kids and adult fans alike."
5,my niece loved it,my niece is in love with scooby doo and this was a perfect addition to her collection. she's 3 some parts are a little to scary for her so if you're buying this for little kids make sure the parents get a chance to watch it for the scarier parts..
4,Good movie,My son likes this Scooby Doo movie. It's kind of scary for young children but older kids will like it.
5,A great book that gives the intuition of the math,"Before borrowing this book from the school library, I was completely lost in the coding class. I can understand the equations in some other book but I can't understand why they are so. I lacked the physical meaning behind these equations and I lacked the bigger picture as well. I borrowed this book from the library hoping to fix my problems before the upcoming the mid-term, and indeed the book proved the most helpful. Don't be fooled by the small size of the book or the ""a mathematical introduction"" in the title. This books addresses intuition before delving into the math. The solutions of the exercises are also available in the book making this book a great tool for self-learning. Anyhow, I returned the book to the library and ordered it from Amazon. To make a long story short, HAVE THIS BOOK in your personal library."
5,Contains excerpts of hard-to-find sagas,"Contains excerpts of hard-to-find sagas:1. Viga-Glum's saga,2. Kormak's saga,3. Kristni saga,4. Stufs saga,5. Saga of The Faroe Islands, others."
5,Amazing!,"I started using this pretty recently. I am pregnant with my third child and instead of getting more stretch marks, the ones I currently have are disappearing! I have tried several different things to get rid of my previous pregnancy stretch marks, but nothing really worked. With this pregnancy though, I started noticing that I was getting stretch marks higher up on my belly. I asked my midwife if she recommended anything for the stretch marks, and she told me about this product. Within the first two days of using this oil, the little stretch marks that I had begun developing were gone, and within the first week, my old stretch marks were starting to disappear. I am putting it on twice a day. I have to say that I've never met this products match! I will definitely keep buying it, if not for me, than for a friend!"
5,"natural, and good",I looked all over for a cocoa butter to use to prevent stretch marks while pregnant. Some of them have really gnarly ingredients- one even had ingredients linked to preterm labor! You can check the EWG website to look up the safety of lotions and cosmetics. I tried a bunch of natural creams with no preservatives at my local health store and this one was the best. Some of them had hardened scratchy bits of shea butter in them. This one is really nice- it has a blend of oils with cocoa butter and it goes on really nicely. It has a slight cocoa butter scent that you get used to. I've used this oil since I found out I was pregnant. So far I'm 6 months pregnant and no stretch marks!
5,It works,"I used this religiously since mid-2nd trimester. I gained 45 lbs total. I had a C-section. When a nurse was examining my stitches, the 1st thing she said when she saw my stomach, ""Wow! No stretchmarks!"""
5,Great for pregnancy,"I had a 9lb 13 oz baby 11 days late and gained 37lbs while pregnant. I started using this product around week 16 and got no stretch marks anywhere! I used twice a day on my hips, breast and tummy. I would definitly recommend this product to pregnant mommies! I also love the fact that is all natural."
2,Not 4me,I bought this oil about 3months ago and i still got stretch marks. I noticed them in my inner arms and now that im 7mo. im noticing some on my upper stomach.. Maybe the product just not for me
4,Ingredients Don't Match Description on Amazon,"For this product, the description of ingredients on Amazon included: Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, Pecan Oil, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin E. But on the product itself, there is no Pecan Oil listed. That being said, I still really like the product so far and it has a very mild scent (smells like hot cocoa). I still think it's important to correct the ingredients listed since consumers look for specific oils for different healhcare properties."
1,not the original PB Twix :(,I was disappointed when I received this in the mail today- they are NOT the original Peanut Butter Twix Bars!!! (which is what the pictures shows)They are the new CHOCOLATE cookie Peanut Butter Twix Bars!!!!SO UPSETTING
1,Just another corporate-type training manual,"I didn't read much of this book, then tossed it. I had hoped for something that really focused on creating resiliency, and this thing read like the typical robot oriented philosophy I've seen so much in corporate training. Just have the right attitude, just stay positive, just don't be like those other losers..... So where's the real tools for how to increase your own resiliency? How do these people really stay positive in the face of adversity? It was so unreadable, I couldn't go any further. My experience with books like this, and I've read more than a few, is the tone and content is set early on, and if it seems like drivel it won't change, so I didn't read on."
5,Very good book,"There will be problems in life that cannot be resolved, but only endured. My relatives in the internment camps during WWII used words such as ""gaman"" (perseverence), and ""shigata ga nai"" (nothing can be done). They did the best that they could with what they had. This is the essence of resilience.A legal secretary friend of mine read my copy of this book. It gave her the ability to rise above the bullying and insults from the attorneys that she works with. She now receives more respect from these higher ups."
2,Boring Book,"This is a required book for one of my classes but I thought I would enjoy it. I think the author goes about teaching resiliency in a backwards manner and if this book is not required for a course, I would not recommend it. I will say it is a matter of personal opinion whether you like this book."
5,"Great, helpful book.","This book helps the reader take any experience, no matter how difficult or seemingly negative, and frame it as a learning experience. In doing so, the reader becomes more powerful and knowledgeable, and something negative changes to positive. Siebert's book has gotten my through some tough times, and has helped me grow from them."
5,Rorem's Art of the Song,"An evening-long work that comprises 36 songs, divided into three sections, using poems and prose from a variety of writers in English. Rorem has always been a marvel at selecting texts to be sung and he doesn't let us down here. Some groups of songs are performed without breaks; indeed some songs act as bridge passages between the songs on either side of them and go by before you're aware of it.At times his word-setting is awkward. I have the impression, since he is clearly a master word-setter, that this is to catch our attention, rather than being a sign of ineptness or loss of focus. It's as if he's saying ""this is important, listen to this.""Rorem is certainly one of our master song writers and this may be his best sustained effort in a long and productive career. Huzzah!"
4,My Attitude is Great About This Book,"I heard Keith Harrell speak at a sales meeting in January and immediately bought his book. Keith is the real deal. He weaves stories about his life into the principles he reveals about how much our attitude effects our lives and the lives of those around us. He obviously has a relationship with God, and he uses that relationship as the foundation stone for his belief system. I highly recommend this book for adults and teenagers alike."
5,I am convinced that Attitude is Everything!,This book along with my faith is one of the key reasons why I am succeeding in my professional career. Learning to build my A team with people that connect with my vision and values as well as understanding the root causes of a bad attitude. I recognize that attitude is a choice and I'm choosing to have a Super-Fantastic attitude every single day. Thanks Dr. Attitude for the attitude tune-up!
5,Attitude is every thing,High value for the motivation. Very easy to read and understand. You get fired up. It is a great book for the young Adults or the teenagers.
2,Very narrow focus,"I noticed on the 1st CD a pattern that did not change into the 3rd CD- Almost all of his examples and stories are about himself. When he was in school and stuttered, when he wasn't drafted to the NBA, when he was painting, when he had to give a speech, when he was driving in Atlanta, when he was at a ball game, when he was a college player, on and on and on. While I see he has achievd a lot in his life, these stories about himself did not seem all that interesting or motivating. I would have preferred that he did some detailed research and found some real motivating stories about other people that illustrated his points. It seemed like he decided to write this book and did not do any research-he just thought of stories in his own life as examples. I found it boring."
4,The Key to First Impressions and Life's Success in General,"Great, simple, down to earth book about your attitude which everybody should be able to relate to, I believe. Fast read, well designed and presented, telling stories from Keith Harrell's own personal development journey. Make sure you have a highlighter available as there will be many points you'll wish to come back to for reference. I highly recommend it!"
2,Attitude is Not Enough,"I look for two things from a self-help book or tape. First it should motivate me to make changes in some parts of my life. Second, it should give me some practical tips on how to make those changes. This tape fails in both respects. While the stories are of Keith Harrell's life are impressive, I often found them difficult to apply to my own situation. And his suggestions on how to improve attitude were vague and didn't give me enough to hold on to. There were some valuable sections on these tapes, but overall I was disappointed."
5,"Excellent writing, deeply known characters","I checked this book out of the library simply because Hazzard won the 2003 National Book Award for The Great Fire which I have not read. This is a tightly written short novel with excellent characterization and a complex, slowly evolving plot. The setting, Naples, Italy, in about 1952, is different and mysterious to me. The story said a lot about human nature and the peculiar ways that love and friendship evolve. I recommend it highly."
5,"Wow-The ""Bad Lieutenant"" of Books","This book was unreal and just served to reinforce my belief that when it comes to hard-boiled crime nobody does it better than the Brits! Bill James Harpur and Isles series, John Harvey's Charlie Resnick books, Russell James, Derek Raymond and Peter Turnbull's Glasgow P Division procedurals-the list goes on and on and is just breathtaking as one works through these writers. Anyway, The White Trilogy is dark, funny, cynical, tough,uplifting and hard to put down once you start. Let me put it this way, if you went to see the movie ""Bad Lieutenant"" and didn't walk out and are glad you didn't-get your hands on The White Trilogy. As much as I am into diversity in my reading material, after reading this book I am straight into Bruen's The Guards. Trust me on this-better yet take the ""Bad Lieutenant"" test by renting it and you'll know whether to invest in this gem."
3,Not Jack Taylor!,"Bruen's writing is very engaging. His narrative is complex but fun to read. I am addicted to his Jack Taylor books. The earlier books deserve to be seen and read, but that are not Jack Taylor!"
5,Sa-mooth,"it's fun to just curl up with this playing, and relax...you can do anything with it playing, and when it's all over you feel refreshed, and you want more of it."
1,"Didn't last 20,000 miles","Today I removed my Autolite xp605 Iridiums trying to eliminate a misfire(at partial throttle) I've had for almost a month...and that's after $300+ on other ignition related parts and sensors trying to find the problem. I changed my plugs even though I had under 20k miles on them. I did not suspect them to be bad but I was just trying to narrow the possibilities down. Having never checked resistance on a spark plug before, I decided to try it. I found where these plugs have a reliable range of 2k to 20k ohms. Four of my six plugs ranged from 4k to 6.1k ohms, one at almost 16k, the other at 246k! I then test drove my truck... smooth as could be. I spent about $7-8 a plug right after they came out. I'm very disappointed. Stock AC Delcos are back in."
5,Europe a History,"A really enthralling book. This book did exactly what I wanted, it lead me by the hand through the whole of the history of the European Continent, relating all the major happenings and the reasons why they happened. It also gives a good description of what was happening on the periphery of major events and how the two were intertwined. Obviously the real details of most events are not gone into, as nearly 1400 pages are more than enough for one book, but there are obvious points where Davies drops teaser for you to delve more, and every 5th page or so had me surfing the web for more details on specific events of interest to me. Also if you read this book with a copy of ""Periodical Historical Atlas of EuropeExpert v. 1.2"" software it will greatly enhance your experience, (and no, i have nothing to do with the company). All in all a GREAT book to spend time reading and enjoying."
5,Breathtaking,"Norman Davies is clearly confident that his view of history in general and history of Europe in particular is more interesting and probably more valid than many others who have approached these topics. I surmise that his view of history is that it is an argument to be waged, about the larger patterns and the more subtle threads, rather than a simple telling of the episodes and icons which later political entities have enshrined into myths that serve the ends of governance. On this score, Davies would not be unique. But in telling the history of Europe with this approach, he has undertaken a topic of so enormous a scope such that the scholarship would have to be breathtakingly manifest and the arguement would have to be breathtakingly persistant and persuasive. And he pulls it off. What emerges is a wonderfully constructed version of European history that seems connected across time and space. I found myself both stimalated and inspired."
3,Kudos for the attempt,"This is a decent one volume review that hits on the high points of prehistory up until present times. WARNING: the description of Islam is hopelessly whitewashed and makes naive claims regarding it's initial history. One almost has the impression that Islam was and continues today to lead the equal rights for women movement, if the author is taken to be an authority on these matters. There are whiffs of PC indoctrination, but not frequent enough to throw the baby out with the bath water. The maps and charts are superb. The author also should get kudos by presenting the Eastern lands in equal measure and focus. If you want to supplement your study of one particular group in Europe with a broader context, this is a decent book for the purpose."
3,Europe Writ Large,"If you enjoy reading abbreviated encyclopedia versions of important subject matter then this book will delight you to no end; it is chock full of information unburdened by any required heavy lifting, i.e., knowledgeable exposition or rigorous thought in analyzing Western thought and tradition. In fact the author himself states that ""The academic apparatus has been kept to a minimum (in favor, one may assume, of more pedestrian accounts). There are no notes relating to facts and statements that can be found in any of the established works of reference. Among the latter, special mention must be made of my twenty-nine volumes of The Encyclopedia Britannica...."" So, if this is to your liking, then, by all means, buy it and read it; if nothing else, Davies' Europe is a respectable reference work, which may at least serve to whet one's appetite for more in-depth reading and investigation in area or specialized studies."
4,Europe in One Book,"This 4-pound,1300 page book by Norman Davies recounts the histories of the peoples who occupied the European peninsula from the withdrawal of the ice age to the end of the Cold War.Short, narrow-themed capsules pepper this 4-star book. Each of the 25 chapter ends with a wide-angled shot of events on the peninsula at a particular time.People who developed outstanding literature, music, painting and sculpture of various periods are describe, but the this history of Europe is mainly descriptions of the slauters resulting from a continual succession of wars. Considerable space is allocated to the adventures of those that caused the greatest slaughters - Alexander the Great, Hitler, Stalin, ... Nevertheless, it is a good reference book."
1,Save your money!,Go find a history professor who has fallen prey to schizophrenia and have him jabber at you endlessly. It might be more coherent.
2,Slavophobic,"I think that the author showed reluctancy to accept the fact that Poles are not the victims of Russians. The clash started long time ago, and it continued into modern times. He writes about the oprression of Ortodox chuch on Uniates but doesent mention the fact that Vatican was and still is much more agressive and much more opressive than the Russian Ortodox church. He also writes about the fact that state should create nation and not the other way around, most of examples are confirming that he is right, but in balkan Peninsula we have situation where nation created the state, and it is the only way for state to fuinction i that part of the world."
1,Disappointing because it is subjective,"I find this book dissappointing cause it is subjective just like some other people said. I dont want some so-called ""author's"" view of why something suposely happened but the real truth and Norman Davy is biassed! He is always writing about how eastern Europe are important, maybe more important than western Europe this offends me and is stupid! Why can't he be like all the other true books about Europe that France and England are the most important ones. My ancesters come from England with the pigrims and and some from France. What makes Norman Davy so special he can disagree with importan historians? This should not be allowed! Maybe he shold look at a map of Europe and see Poland is labaled eastern Uerope before he tries to write another book that is so stupid. Maybe he should read history books from school to learn how stupid he is! THe book is also to long and stupid."
2,Disappointing,"This book has been a huge best-seller in the U.K. where I presently reside. Since my wife and I will spend the next 2 years touring Europe, it seemed like an ideal purchase. I was very disappointed and felt that I had wasted my money. The book rambles and is overly verbose. Further, inordinate attention is placed on the author's speciality area: Eastern Europe. If you are interested in an alternative I would highly recommend The History of Europe by Oxford's John Roberts. That book is better written and does a superior job of illuminating the mechanisms underlying the continent's great historic changes. I would score it a 10."
3,So so,"I have two reservations about this book:1) He doesn't give enough of a general picture, and concentrates too much on specifics, some of which don't seem particularly important.2) There is a definite anti-zionist tone. For example prior to 1948 both the zionists and Arabs were trying to oust the British from Palestine. Davies terms the Zionists terrorists, while the Arabs are called rebels. Either call both rebels or both terrorists."
1,A much-hyped work suffering from innumerable errors of fact.,"This is a most perplexing work. It has received extensive and highly favourable reviews, but its reliability as a general work of history is slim. The straightforward and quite extreme errors of fact are almost as numerous as the page numbers - for example, Davies gets the dates of all but one of the British Tudor monarchs wrong. What I find especially misleading, though, is its relentless stress on the centrality of Polish history to Europe; this reflects the author's specialism, not a disinterested judgement. Finally, his treatment of the term ""genocide"", with its bizarre attempt to identify analogous experiences with the Holocaust, runs perilously close to frivolity. All in all, this book will probably be forgotten in a few years' time; at least, I hope so."
1,SKETCHY,"While it is apparent that Davies has a marvelous knowledge of Europe's vast history, this book is nothing more than a disorganized outline. He does not go into any detail and assumes that the reader is on his own level of prexistent knowledge. In the section on Greece, he only mentioned the name of Alexander the Great once or twice. I was stunned.The same goes for the rest of the book. One should have a PH. D. in history before beginning this book."
2,Davies Misses the Boat,"Huge, Dense and Fun in an excruciating kind of way, but Davies assertion that Poland is central to Europe or European culture or tradition (in any sense other than geographical) is dead wrong, perhaps he should look just a little to the west. In attemping to ""define"" Europe - 'what makes Europe European?' - he misses again! Maybe the Celto-Germanic-Slavic ethnic/racial continuum and it's roots in a common kinship, culture and religious tradition might shed some light there, Norm. Lastly, it's hard to believe that ""serious scholors"" will flirt with the notion that the Greek tradition owes so much to imports from the Middle East, perhaps Norm forgot to read his Hesiod. The strongest qualities in this work are the energies spent on the 'Volkerwanderung' and the great ""capsules"" full of tastey tidbits. If you already have this one - keep it for the shelf, if not join the ranks of the Grand-European-History-Hunters."
5,"Great ""encyclopedic"" overview with unique ""snapshots""","Davies has tackled a huge subject, and manages to convey information on literally thousands of years on an entire continent, but also manages to focus on individuals, a city, or particular happenings within a country in his ""snapshots"". Highly recommended for anyone who didn't get the whole picture of Europe in school"
3,Should have been longer.,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is inadequately short to deal with its subject matter. Davies should have had at least two volumes, each the length of this book (around 1300 pages). Also, as others have mentioned, the little out-of-context essays that Davies inserts veer on the edge of obnoxiousness. He'd have been better off to include these essays at the back of the book as appendix essays. However, for an overview of the development of the landmass we call Europe, Davies's book is highly informative and does not talk down to its audience. Despite its flaws, ""Europe: A History"" is a worthwhile purchase.Something I would like to address before I finish, though, is the comment that ""A reader"" made regarding the ""propaganda"" in this book: how can you call this man a Nazi? He's so obviously liberal that it makes my head hurt to think about it. He very nearly denies the concept of race, so it's somewhat absurd to call the man a racist."
2,Kindle version is terrible,"I love Norman Davies - his history of the British Isles is excellent. Unfortunately his books are rather thick, so the idea of getting Europe on kindle so that I may read it more easily and in more circumstances (who really wants to lug a large, thick book around on public transport?) weighed heavily on my decision to purchase it.Turns out that I should have flushed the $15 I spent down the toilet as the kindle version is unreadable. For those familiar with the author, you will know that he puts lots of 'asides' and related facts into boxes within the text. These boxes can go on for pages, but the layout in the book makes it clear what they are. Not so for the kindle. The sections run on to each other with only a subtle shift in font to highlight that you are no longer reading a paragraph related to the one prior. I struggled for a while but have given up. I guess if I want to read it I'll have to go for the print edition."
3,Be aware: it is controversial,"I am currently reading excerpts from this book, and in checking it out, I came across the fact that it was reviewed in the New York Times, by a Princeton professor, who was very critical of many mistakes in the text. (see excerpt from his review below). According to another review, some of these facts have been checked in subsequent editions. Just be aware of the background when you read the book:from the NYTimes review (by Theodore K. Rabb):""Without looking anything up, this reviewer spotted inaccuracies, on average, every other page. Things got so bad that eventually I counted seven wrong dates in 11 lines, and soon thereafter (nearly two-thirds of the way through the text) I realized that there was little point either in continuing a close reading or in recommending the book to anyone who might regard it as a source of information."""
4,PASS THE OXYGEN!!!,"I must make this review short as finishing this bohemoth of a book has thoroughly exhausted me!Why 4 stars? An unbelievable epic that takes you on a grand tour through the history of Europe, but one that, necessarily, saps you of all strength. It is an overwhelming book, filled with an unimagineable amount of info, that will leave you begging for the end.Don't take this review the wrong way...It is an excellent book, written in a flowing manner, by an author who is well qualified and gifted enough to complete the project. But do not undertake the reading of this book expecting to breeze through thousands of years in a couple of weeks and instantly understand European history. This book takes much pondering and some re-reading to grasp even a small part of it. An excellent candidate for a second reading, unfortunately I could never again labor through the 50 hours needed to complete it. My mind now needs a break...SOMEONE PASS ME THE COMICS!!!"
5,Davies' Fresh Perspective,"This is a tour de force. Davies stands the Anglo-Franco-centric stance of most Western historians on its head. He shows how differently history looks when viewed from a German-Austro-Hungarian-Polish perspective. The big threats to Europe did not come from the West but from the East. Where would Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks, Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna. Davies gives a fresh look at the importance of Central Europe to our culture and civilization. Nobody who reads this book will ever view the history of Western Civilization the same way."
3,Reach exceeds grasp,Davies' Europe is an incredible undertaking. The concept of trying to summarize Europe's history in a single volume is quite a feat. The problem is the author spends far too much time explaining what Europe is (geographically) and too little making a clear explanation of how it all came together. It makes for a good primer but the scope of the book is just too great for one volume.
3,pretty good book,Tom Fitzmorris understands New Orleans cuisine. His recepies are pretty good. It is a nice cookbook.
5,Just try the recipes,"I have been collecting his recipes since I began getting his newletters several years ago. He has a way of bringing out the best flavors in a manor reasonable for home cooks. Since I lost these recipes in Katrina, I am looking forward to having them in book form and intend on giving them as gifts."
3,Nice book,"I really enjoy Tom Fitzmorris's radio show and was excited at buying this cookbook. The book has everything you could possibly want for New Orleans food. However, the recipes make a lot of food. I only cook for two and have tried cutting all the ingredients in half so I wouldn't have as much, but it doesn't work out. So now I only use this book when I am cooking for a party. I have had numerous compliments on the recipes from this book and I recommend this if you are an experienced ""chef."" I only say that because a lot of the recipes require numerous steps and can be frustrating to a beginner. The steps to just make a roux seems simple but I have ceased trying to make it because it never comes out right like to says in the book. I actually prefer the Williams Sonoma cookbook on New Orleans over this one. It has the same recipes as this book but with color pictures of each recipe and the recipes are simpler and delicious."
5,Great Book for New Orleans' Recipes,"I am a native New Orleanian and find this cookbook very, very good. I have tried many of the recipes thus far and have been please with each. Quite a few of these recipe's have resulted in reminding me of my grandmother, mother, and aunt's cooking during the time I was growing up in the New Orleans area (this was an unexpected but pleasant surprise).Mr. Fitzmorris begins each recipe with historical background and/or recollections of his mother preparing the dish. I have found that the recipes are easy to follow, have sufficient detail, and list the ingredients in the appropriate/logical order (not found in many cook books).I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in preparing authentic New Orleans meals."
5,A Beautiful Mix Between Kiss And Back Street Boys,"The band name may have changed 20 times in the past 6 months, but one thing remains the same - Stradavatt can sing, dance and steal the hearts of millions. Dave Gacser is well positioned to be the next teen star rivaling the drawing power of only Leonard DiCaprio. The drawing power of the band is felt in Rio as the radio plays Stradavatt non-stop (although they don't know what the lyrics mean). The lyrics, though, may be the best since Vanilla Ice, the music rivals Jennifer Lopez and the dancing is better than a broadway musical. Overall, it's as pleasing as a tsi-tsu by your side! I just wish they could release another album sometime soon."
4,Wonderful Resource,This book is beautifully written and provides easy to understand information about the Jewish holidays and life cycle events. The reader learns about the traditional ways holidays are celebrated and is introduced to innovative rituals and observances. The author encourages readers to make notes throughout and also offers the opportunity to record ideas and reactions in the personal weavings section at the end. The Tapestry of Jewish Time is a great resource for individuals and families.
3,Of its time and still worth a watch,"An idealistic young man leaves the Catholic seminary and his retired Dad, a former FBI employe, gets him a job with a company which provides equipment and resources to the National Security Agency and the CIA. The young man loses faith in the USA when he comes to believe his country is misusing its powers to undermine democratically elected governments, such as Allende's Chile. The catayst for his turning is the sacking of the Australian Whitlam Govt in November 1975. He starts selling classified info using his drug using buddy as courier. It all goes wrong. THey both get gaoled for a VERY long time. Sean Penn is great. Lyle Mays sound track is good. Worth a watch. Based on a true story."
5,The World in Your Hands,"Just received 'Voyages' from a wonderful former student of mine and I'd have to say it is the BEST book I have received as a gift or purchased. Having written half a dozen of my own books, and often read 20 or 30 books a year, 'Voyages' is the best ever. Graphic design, photographs, postcards and tickets take the reader away to every exoctic destination on the globe. Thanks Marc (author) for a truly unique gift to readers. Richard Stafford, Ph.D."
1,Misleading product. Most of them are demo or trial versions,Couldn't give it 0 stars because the drop down didn't allow me to do so.This is one of those bait CDs which lure you into buying it by offering a lot of programs. But when you open the program you find that almost all of them are merely demo or trial versions. You have to cough up more dollars to actually use the programs. The ones that are free are probably worth the price!
3,Maybe I haven't given the eyeliner a chance ...,"Maybe I haven't given the eyeliner a chance yet, since I've used it only three times. I've used liquid eye liner for MANY years. So, trying the pencil liner was a major change for me. It seems awkward to use. The need to pull on my eyelid when applying it makes it hard to apply properly. After it's on, it does gives a nice effect. It also cleans up better than liquid. But all in all, I don't think it's something I'd purchase again."
4,"I liked this product, even though I'm a ...","I liked this product, even though I'm a liquid eyeliner person. The liner went on easily and stayed on okay. It doesn't come with directions, so I don't know how customers will understand how it can be a wet or dry eyeliner. I experimented with rubbing it on my finger with a drop of water, and it went on great. Without water, it went on great, too. But I still wonder what the """"wet"""" part actually means. It fits great in purses. Don't forget to buy a sharpener!"
5,I really liked this eyeliner. It's a nice ...,I really liked this eyeliner. It's a nice large pencil that'll last and was easy to apply. It has a soft point that didn't pull on my eyelid. I was happy with the coffee bean color. It was long-wearing.
3,"Good game, overall","This game is a lot of fun, story is fairly interesting. It tends to get repetitive in places, boss fights especially, but that isn't constant by any means, and the dogfighting is well done. The online is fairly good, not great but it will fill a few days before you set it down. Planes are interesting, characters are relatively engaging, gameplay and graphics are very polished. Overall, fairly good."
3,NOT GREAT,"After reading all the reviews, I was really disappointed in this game. The graphics and controls are great, but the game itself is tedious. Pretty much the same thing over and over. As far as a ""great"" story, I think not. The story is cheesy, the acting fair and cut scene graphics are average. This is definitely a rent before you buy game."
1,Graphics...That's It,"Crimson Skies is not worth a penny. While the graphics are fairly good, the game itself sucks. You never step out of the airplane and the game is difficult from the beginning. This game is unfairly difficult and will easily make even the most patient gamers frustrated. The game gets old after only a few minutes and nothing new changes in the game except locations. All missions are relatively the same and this game provides no lasting entertainment. I would highly suggest not buying this game. Believe me, this game is NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY."
4,Best action game of 2004,"Would you like to shoot stuff?Would you like to shoot stuff in a plane?Would you like to shoot things like trains?Would you like to play the whole game in one sitting and get severe eye strain and rattle your brains until you can't sleep for weeks and your cheeks get excederin pain as you tweak?Cool. Me too. Maybe twice. Online is fun, too."
4,"Great game, great music!","Not only is this is the best game for Xbox Live! yet, but the musical score is unbelieveable - buy this game and get the soundtrack too!"
4,Surprisingly good port!,"I thought this was going to be a disaster like Mechassault, but this game is actually MORE fun then the PC version. There are a lot more things to do, environments are a lot better looking and the turret shooting is a nice addition."
4,Good Free Add On To Xbox Live Package,I thought this was a good game overall but the gameplay did become repetitve in the story mode. The multiplayer is pretty good. Halo 2 is still the better game for Xbox Live.Good Xbox Live game but not great.
1,Wrong Version,I was disappointed that it wasn't clear what version of xbox this worked on. Or perhaps I didn't see it in the desctiption. Anyway itdid not work with their xbox.
4,Crimson Skies,I just wish they online experience was a little better. I also would love to see a multiplayer version of a modern aircraft flt sim for the Xbox that had the same dogfighting as this game
5,The new reason to buy an x-box,Crimson skies is an EXCELLENT game. I bought an x-box to play halo and mechassault (both of which were great) If you liked those and like arcade style flying (you use combo moves to perform actual manuevers like barrell rolls etc) or just like zepplins and Pulp age planes then this is a great game for you.
4,Crimson Skies review,"This game is one of the few flying games with great controls. This game is really one of a kind, as there are hardly any games on the market similar to this one. Both the multiplayer and singleplayer are fun. There is a nice selection of planes, each with different special attacks. The controls are fluent and easy to use."
4,GREAT TINY BOOMBOX FOR 5 YEAR OLD TO CARRY AROUND,I got this (Cd/radio) boombox for my niece & she loved it so much I bought it for my 4 year old daughter too. It is really tiny. It is really lightweight & has a little handle which makes it easy to carry around & buttons are easy to use too. The sound quality is pretty decent too. It comes in blue too.
3,Not Bad But ........,It does an OK job of protecting the camera. I thought the seal would be a bit better. Access to camera controls is good except for the slide to switch from picture to movie to view mode. Switching modes takes a few tries until you get the switch moved all the way over. Don't know you would do this with even the thinnest gloves.
4,good case,Be sure and test it first before you use in underwater with your camera. Mine hasn't leaked yet and has survived snowboarding in 24 degree weather. Changing modes is hard but a couple of trys and you should get it. This seems to be a strong case. Just wish it wasn't so expensive.Also it will fog so load camera in an air conditioned setting and put some anti fog stuff like catcrap on the inside of lense.
5,Kickass product!,"This is a must have for snorkeling, sea kayaking or any water sports. You can access pretty much all the buttons. Ours worked like a charm!"
1,"Really, Really Bad","A product has to be really, really bad for me to write a negative review. I think the only bad review I've ever written was for a baby swing that wound up being recalled by the CPSC. Point is, this keyboard tray is BAD. Really bad. It is a piece of plywood suspended between two flimsy rolling arms that attach to the underside of the desk with gigantic galvanized metal brackets. I spent hours attaching it only to remove it at the end of the day because it was so bulky and wiggly and ugly and dangerous. The manufacturer's description honestly sounds like it's for a different product...I checked my model number several times before writing this review! The drawer does not ""lock"" into place...you can pull it right out (I mean ALL the way out) and there's not a single ball bearing in sight! I could have easily built this with junk I have in my basement. Only mine would have been better. Hopefully I've made my point and saved you some time, money and aggravation."
1,No product description,Why would I want to buy this product? There is no detailed product description. Let's start with that and then maybe I would buy it and review it later.
5,moonstone beauty,"I love this ring. It is, however, the second time in less than a year that I ordered one. I feel it should be mentioned that the ring is delicate and can break if accidentally hit against a hard surface. I don't know if it's genuine or synthetic since both words are mentioned in the description. It doesn't matter much, though, because the ring is inexpensive and beautiful. The picture doesn't come close to how pretty it really is. I broke it by clapping my hands and it hit another ring on the other hand during a Bears playoff game!"
4,Incorrect sizing,"The largest size available was an 8.5, luckily I wear an 8.5 on my ring fingers... this ring only fits on my pinky, which seems about a 7.5 normally."
4,fun ring,"This moonstone ring looks great, but is kind of bulky. I don't wear it all the time, but when I do, I can't stop playing with it in the light. This is a fun ring for a great price."
4,Moonstone ring...,The ring's coloration was wonderful... Just forgot that it can be somewhat fragile... It cracked after a week of regular use... I would recommend this ring for people who won't be using it as an everyday accessory...but overall I was happy with my purchase...
1,Very poor quality,"I bought this ring to replace one my girlfriend had lost that had sentimental value. Looked great in the picture but when I got it, it had a big chip missing that was just smoothed over. The ring wasn't even circular!!! Some areas were thicker that others. I was going to send it back but between return shipping and getting a new one, it wasn't even worth it. I went with another company. I would avoid this company. Clearly no quality control."
3,Nice but rather thick,"In the picture the ring appears mostly white, and well half mine is whitish and the other half is translucent., so i was a little upset at that, but it's a $5 ring so you get what you pay for. doesn't feel like plastic to me, feels more like glass and has a neat glow. biggest downside is it's massive thickness. i bought both this ring and the onyx band and the onyx is much thinner and comfortable and you could forget your wearing it. I feel the moonstone is there the entire time i have it on."
4,niiccee,I recently bought this product and it differs a little from the color on the picture but it really is lovely. My fingers are skinny and the ring dwarfs my fingers but i hung it on a chain and it looks really lovely. So even if it doesnt fit just right it looks great on a chain
5,Ab Twister,"I have an ongoing ab issue.I purchased the Ab Twister at least six years ago (or more) and found it to be outstanding. Unfortunately, I did not order additional bands and did not take care of the band that came with the machine. I left my Ab Twister out on an open porch (winter and summer) and the band deteriorated. Unable to secure a new band, my Ab Twister is a ghost of it's former self, and no longer resides with me.Since then I have tried to locate and purchase another Ab Twister machine, but it is no longer available. I have purchased, tried, and return at least five ab machines that do not work for me. The Ab Twister allowed me to trim down my mid-section and strengthen by abs without over stressing my abs or other areas. It quickly gave me the results I was looking for, a slimmer stronger mid-section.Please bring back my Ab Twister."
5,Excellent photography,"It's not meant to be a ""gung-ho, kill'em all and let God sort'em out"" type of military book.It tells the story of how our brave men and women pass the time in a foreign land while waiting for their orders, knowing that just over the horizon there's a country to invade and enemies to battle. Meanwhile, they're trying to create the illusion of home and the comfort of routine...they get their hair cut, they play cards, they wash the jeeps and humvees, they horse around and write letters home and shop for soda and hot rod magazines.These aren't the stories and photos of glory on the battlefield. It's what our soldiers do before and after their job is done.Yet, Bryant shoots his subjects in a touching way and really captures the spirit of each soldier as an individual, with hopes and dreams and fears.It's an engaging and unique book. Not like the other books of military photography out there."
4,On time and at a good price,"I would have like to have known that there were quite a few notes written in it, but in this case it is actually quite interesting."
5,An instructive book,"This is a rather tame book about the Arab war against Israel. But it does serve to show why many Arabs and Jews are at odds not only with each other, and not only with their compatriots, but also with many of the people from outside the region who purport to give them advice.Most of what is in the book is well-known history and would be unremarkable were it not for some incredible fabrications in books by people such as Shahak, Chomsky, Finkelstein, Pappe, Hirst, and Said. Probably the contamination of the international information supply with these ad hoc antizionist untruths is a more serious aspect of the Arab war against Israel than the actual terror and aggression. For that reason, a book such as this one is a good place to start to try to learn something about the problem."
4,It's an old book- but it is still correct with information,This book is not the newest of books- but I found it very helpful and interesting. It is on the recommended reading list-recommended to me by ZOLA LEVITT- a well-known bible teacher.
1,Deeply flawed,"It's so evident that this so called ""author"" is a horrible person who filled this book with fabrications to deceive the public. This book is a complete joke and she ought to be ashamed of herself."
1,A Sham and pseudo-scholarship,"In the number of books on the Palestine-Israel debate, this ranks among the very worst. It is a sheer forgery (as most knowledgeable scholars on both sides of the story have labeled it). It is simply pseudo-history!I recommend instead looking at Benny Morris ""Righteoys Victims"" and ""Making Israel"", Ilan Pappe ""The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine"", Noam Chomsky "" Fateful Triangle: The United States, Israel and the Palestinians"" and ""Gaza In Crisis"", Tom Segev ""1967: Israel, the War, and the Year that Transformed the Middle East"", Jonathan Cook ""Disappearing Palestine"", Avi Shalim ""Israel and Palestine"", and a host of literature available from Robert Fisk. This book is a giant distortion!"
4,Time to Read this Book,"Everyone should take the time to read this book. It may disqualify many of the myths and beliefs Westerner's have about the Middle East. Knowledge combats illogical prejudice, newscasters, and attempts to sway other's thinking."
5,Arab Myths exposed,"The strength of Peters' book is in its research (almost 1800 references) and its unblinkered look at the facts. She exposes the myths that the Arabs had been in Israel ""from time immemorial,"" (making Jews the interlopers), that Arabs want to live harmoniously with Jews, etc. She shows Jewish life in Moslem countries, and cites some of the hateful passages in the Koran which continue to guide contemporary Moslems, even secular Moslems. Her critics generally fail to identify specific alleged errors or misinterpretations for good reason, for then the discussion would be about those data, the data that Peters cites in detail. Terrific book, and terribly- and ominously- relevant to current events."
1,"Fraudulent work, damaging to Jewish cause","From Time Immemorial was an attempt to prove that the Palestine nation did not exist. It was positively reviewed in the US, but was quickly exposed as a fraudulent account of history after Norman Finkelstein, a Princeton graduate, decided to check every single reference in the book and found the account to be a hoax. (See the Chapter entitled ""Intellectuals and Social Change"" in Understanding Power - The Indispensable Chomsky (Mitchell, P.R. and Schoeffel, J. (Eds)))"
2,"a so-so scourcebook, with too little info on the 'Masters","This is probably the worst scource book (excluding the campaign idea books) that Kevin Siemieda wrote. The artwork is horrible compared to the other books and most of the book is wasted explaining mechs that no gamemaster would use. The lack of information on the Robotech Masters is abhoring, considering there were a mere 12 pages dedicated to them, while there was 10 pages of character sheets alone, all the same save the pictures. The 'Masters are what makes the story so unique in the show and the books, but are shunned in this book. This is surprising because almost all of Siembieda's scourcebooks are of the highest quality. If your looking for more information on the Army of the Southern Cross (ASC) robots, mechs, and fighters than you ever thought possible, this is the book for you. If; however, you are looking for a great informational guide on the 'Masters, it isn't and you should be looking elsewhere for that book."
4,good book over priced,For a good technical discussion of this book see my husband Michael Chernick's reviews. He buys too many books! I am only glad that he got this for the original list price which is about half the current $198. To pay nearly 200 dollars for a book of this size is really outrageous!
3,"Too big for 49 keys, but great for 61","I bought this for a 49 key travel keyboard controller. It does the job decently, but feels like a Kind size fitted sheet for a Queen size mattress, if this helps. I've no regrets, as there are no dedicated 49 key covers, and I think other reviewers may have alerted me to that fact, but just keep in mind this is not ideal for 49 key keyboards (though you can tighten the string that wraps the cover around).Three stars, only because 'it's ok' only for 49 keys; no other complaints."
1,Garbage,"These mounts are third world junk. One star is the lowest I could go on the rating.I didn't think anything could be worse than the usual Chinese knockoff parts, but those are jewelry by comparison to these.These are ill fitting, crudely made, inaccurately sized India-sourced trash.They are more than 1/8 inch off in some critical areas. Don't plan on these fitting your car without a great deal of grinding, filing, hammering, and swearing.AVOID!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS STRATEGY GUIDE RULES! W/O IT I WOULD HAVE NEVER BEAT THIS GAME. IT HAS DETAILED DESCRIPITIONS OF ALL THE WEAPONS AND MAPS. AS WELL AS IN DEPTH TACTIC GUIDES.A MUST HAVE FOR THE H/C GAMER:)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This book is terrible,"Another bad book on Web Services. I bought this book as well as Professional XML Web Services, and both are terrible. If you are a developer, then this book doesn't even go into any detail about how Web Services work.It gives you examples using GLUE which is useless and will fade into complete and utter obscurity. Of course, GLUE is completely incompatible with all the other real SOAP implementations, so if you get this book, you will need to go out and search for a better book, like I'm going to have to right now."
1,don't waste your money !!!!,"Don't waste your money with these chargers !!!! They worked for the first few charges and then broke. (within a week) If the price seemed too good to be true, it was. These are horrible products and the people making and selling this [...] should be put away !!!!"
4,Good Stuff,"Everything is great, its the best value EVER! All the stuff you get is way more than worth the money. The only bad thing is the case cuz it broke like 3 days later but the chargers are great. The wire length on the plug-in one is small so thats kind of the bad thing but everything else is good."
3,the razor acessories,"yes very happy about product but the house adapter does not work for long (it seems to be the problem with these),it seems to get a short in them. the deal for this was great but the overall is satisfactory.thankyou much."
5,"Awesome, Wonderful, Great!!!!!","Great deal, great product. Everything included, new and in perfect condition. Thank you!"
1,Bad Razor phone chargers,the wall charger and the car charger did not work and so they sent me a new one. The new one the wall charger works but the car one does not so once again I need to return it and hopefully they send me one i hope.
4,"Ideally, life as it should be but is no longer","This account of a year in the life of Edith Holden is heart warming and an escape from the harsh realities of modern day life. There are wonderful paintings, informative descriptions of flora and fauna and a glimpse of life gone by to which we would sometimes wish to return, however briefly."
1,I would haven't given it any stars at all.,"The book, in my opinion wasn't written very well. A high school student could have written it better. I did however finish the book and then threw it in the trash. It is probably the only book that I have ever thrown out. If you like an intelligent read then this is not the book for you. If you just want blood and guts then go ahead and read it."
5,Must Read For All !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Naquin and Holton have an effective straight forward approach to managing and training new employees. The book was quite educational and I recommend it to any business or institution that are faced with the challenge of hiring and maintaining new college graduates.
5,message from holly,because it's an awesome movie.I still can't play it on my dvd player but i can use my BIL's portable Player and it works great.Thank you.
3,Are we evolving into munchkins?,"Unfortunately along with several other mini-arch-books,I purchased this one as well.(Amazon, you need to provide overall book dimensions on all of your descriptions...please)The one glaring error with this book is that it needs to be about two times larger.While the residential projects them selves are quite interesting. The floor plans, elevations, and sections when provided (not nearly enough) are so miniscule that they are disappointing.(Just make the books bigger, I will gladly pay the extra money for the larger format)A brief inadequate description accompanies each project, and leaves you wanting to learn more about the projects site, design and materials."
1,Still havent received product,I still havent received this product and it has been about 5-6 weeks. I have contacted the seller and still have not had a response.
5,"excellent service, definitely will buy more product from this seller","thank you so much for the book. it was very good condition and fast delivery, definitely will buy more product from this seller. excellent service"
5,BRS: Physiology,This is a great book. It sums up each section of physiology into about 20 pages. Would definitely recommend.
4,"Classicly funny Marx brothers, video is fair","This film has some very funny lines and is done in the classic slapstick Marx brothers style. Because of its age and being Black and White, the video is only fair and the audio is quite quiet. A classic you will want to add to your collection."
2,"Great Movie, Poor DVD","If I was reviewing the movie only, I would give it five stars. Some of my favorite Groucho Marx lines are in this movie. However, the DVD was itself was of poor quality. The movie film that was recorded was in poor condition with bad scratches in many places and, toward the beginning, a really bad splice had been made. Fortunately, no actual content had been cut. I was disappointed Universal did not go to the trouble of digitally restoring the movie. Cleaning up the bad splice may have been difficult but the scratches should have been comparatively easy. I would have happily paid more for a better quality DVD."
2,"a disappointment, especially in sound quality","This DVD was a dissapointment, especially in sound and video quality (what else is there?). I know that the film was a very early talkie, but I didn't find the quality of the sound and video any better than the earlier video versions I have seen. I was really look forward to seeing and hearing some of my favorite Marx Brothers bits, but the sound drops in and out inconsistently. I expected more from a higher priced DVD -- and there are no extras. I hope they do better when the eventually release ""A Night at the Opera""."
3,"Slow-paced, but still funny Marx brothers","There were scenes during this movie that were a little too long, which is unusal for their Paramount films, but for example the secene where Groucho, Zeppo, and Margaret Dumont discuss the robbery gets old after a while, the same for the scene where Groucho and Chico discuss how to recover the stolen paintings. However the scene when Chico and Harpo change the paintings and the whole blackout bit is very funny, along with the bridge game. On the whole an ejoyable movie."
3,Standard Marx hilarity!,"This is a showcase for the peerless talents of the funniest comedy team of all time. Highlights: the card game, and ""one morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got into my pajamas I don't know."" Written by Morrie Ryskind."
2,Garbage,I have a lot of respect for FLA.. But not this. This is garbage. Amazing programming.. But why in the hell do they insist on the terrible vocals? This CD would benefit so much more if these songs were instrumentals.. But no instead we get great atmospheric music with annoying grunts and impossible-to-understand vocals. The terrible lyrics on this CD broke its play worthy-ness. Even yelworc is better.. if you can believe that
3,good for the price,"it's definitely bulkier than the picture seems, but it's a decent camera. it's a great camera when considering the price."
2,Not worth it,"I already have an expensive but rather bulky digital camera so I wanted to get another camera that is lighter and smaller and that I could put into my pockets. I bought this product because of its features at a comparatively low price. The camera initially worked ok. The picture quality, though, was quite mediocre. And after several months of light use the camera stopped working.In hindsight, I would rather spend a little bit more money and get a more reliable, higher quality camera."
4,Great 1st time digital camera,"My 15yr old loves this camera, it fits in his pockets and the screen is larger than we thought it would be."
5,Worth It,"It's an incredible product especially for the price. My one issue is the flash is incredibly bright. But that can be a plus as well. Also, the optical zoom isn't incredible but it's good enough.I just bought another for my mom's birthday actually and she's in love with it."
4,Camera,"Great little camera - especially for the priceI am amazed at the quality of pictures it is taking - even at night.The only drawback is that it does not come with rechargeable batteries. However, i would definently recommend this camera. I was very suprised with the quality!"
1,Battery Monster,"I saw the camera, loved it, bought it, now I can't use it because NO battery lasts more than 3 minutes. I have bought 3 sets of rechargeable batteries and charger and it is now obvious that I am wasting money. The issue is NOT the batteries, but the camera."
3,Great for the price but..,...it does not come with an internal battery so like other digital cameras it will eat your regular batteries with before the night is over. Get some rechargeables. Also the USB is proprietary so if you loose you can only order it thru GE. Otherwise it is a great lil cam.
2,"I liked it, but...","Quit working for me after about 6 months. Just turned off and even with new batteries, wouldnt turn on."
2,Great camera while it last,"In a little more than 1 year, I have had 2 GE A730 cameras. GE replaced the first camera because it stopped working during our vacation. (8 months after we bought it.) They replaced it because it was a manufacturer's defect and they replaced it with a refurbished model. The second one didn't perform as well as the first one. It was sluggish- sometimes needing to press the shutter button 3 times for just one picture. It was nice as a backup though. The size was nice and the fact that it needed 2- AA batteries was very convenient. The second one decided to quit working at my grandma's funeral. (6 months after GE replaced it). Absolutely no warning that it was failing. Let me down once, shame on you, let me down twice- shame on me. I will not be replacing the camera with another GE."
1,Don't wast your cash,"Very frustrating. I purchased this in spite of the many reviews about the battery life. After researching a bit it seemed that doing a firmware upgrade takes care of the problem...it doesn't. I have yet to take more than one picture with ANY type of battery. Rechargables don't work at all, lithium takes a picture then dies so there is no way to download, special camera batteries were no better. Spent $35 in batteries and no camera. The batteries are still powering my old camera though so they aren't a total waste. GE was no help. So either spend extra to get the battery issue solved or get lucky and get one without a battery issue. Would not recommend this to anyone, regardless of the price. Stick with Canon or Sony, I've never had an issue with either of those brands."
5,Best camera you'll find for under $100,"I've had this camera for over 2 years now using it as a weekend warrior and an ""At work"" camera. Taking pictures for bulletins, newsletters, art shots and more. This little workhorse of a camera has features beyond it's price tag. And what's better is that they actually work. Play with some of the settings to get best results. Small in size but big in quality, I would buy 2 of these over a more expensive model. A MUST have if your going on vacation and don't want to bring along your $600 Cannon. You'll still get great shots.It's only down side is slow picture taking speed. Expect to wait at least 2 seconds between shots, the Auto focus can take a little bit of time too. But are expected on almost any sub $200 camera.After 2-1/2 years and more than 10,000 pictures taken, i am still very happy with my little GE. Keep it in your back pocket and go take some pictures."
3,Decent,"I like the camera, but it drains the batteries. Of course, I'm using regular batteries, so maybe the special batteries made just for cameras will be better, we'll see. The picture quality is ok, but some tend to be fuzzy, even on the stabilizer setting. Good camera for the money, I guess you get what you pay for, right?"
3,so-so,I bought this camera for my wife in 2007. It takes ok pictures and is very easy to use.Never had any of the appearantly common battery issues until early 2010 when the Alkaline batteries would go dead for no reason while the camera was off and put away.Brand new batteries would die in a week of storage. This problem seems to have subsided after I did the recommended firmware upgrade at General Imaging's site.We will see.
3,Not as stated. They LIED.,The product does not perform as it should. it also did not come with batteries as it stated. i am highly dissappointed in my first amazon purchase.
3,It's an okay camera,"Overall, this is a decent pocket camera. It does have a lot of features, with pretty good focus and zoom. It takes SD and SDHC cards. I noticed this seems less likely to turn on with my rechargeable batteries. It may sound funny, but sometimes other cameras I have can turn on with batteries this one won't work with. I think it's because the batteries are old, and the camera might require a little more power. It seems as though the images turn out blurrier more times than my cameras from Canon and Kodak, but it is usually not too bad. There is a video mode (.mov format), however, the audio quality is severely lacking. Do not depend on the video function. I have had this camera since December 2007, and it has held up well. Pretty good build quality. The screen can be hard to see sometimes. It also isn't that bright (at least to me). Overall, I say this is an OK camera. I would try something else a bit newer from a more popular manufacturer."
4,Great camera,I bought this camera to replace a $350 first generation SONY digital camera that I've had for over 5 years. This camera works great. Large LCD screen and easy to use controls are a plus. The camera is very well put together - a quality product. Syncs effortlessly with my Macbook and my PC. Picture quality is very good. A great camera for anyone looking for a digital camera at a reasonable price.
2,Purple...,It is small and light weight camera that starts quickly... however it turns every picture i take purple...
5,Great camera!!,"I bought this camera for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas, and it was the best purchase ever. The screen is a great size and the picture quality is wonderful, even the videos are clear. If I had to have any complaints, it would be that it doesn't come with a rechargeable battery. We change batteries often but when you see the picture quality, it's well worth it."
4,The camera works great for what i need it for,The only real problem i have with this camera is the fact that point in shoot is impossible. It takes around 10 seconds to boot up and take a picture. Also the firmware must be updated or battery life is crap.
5,A wonderful addition to the Buffy series.,"I really, really enjoyed this addition to the Buffy series - it's one of the best of the young adult length novels. Buffy dusts two teen vamps, angering their mother, who raises a goddess of revenge to punish her. Now Buffy must undergo a test by Nemesis (the goddess). If she fails, her mother dies. I really enjoyed the whole test sequence, especially the part where Buffy has to see what would have happened if she had failed to save her friends at various points. Very emotional. Anyway, I can't say enough good things about this book, so if you are a Buffy fan, just go and read it!"
3,"Very Predictable, but okay","I didn't really enjoy this book because you knew what was going to happen. It was obvious that the vamps were killing the people, and Buffy would of course save the day. The twist with the demons was good, but I wouldn't recommend this book. Dokey is still a newer writer, so taking that into account the book was fair. Not number one on my book list, but an average read."
5,Better than I thought,"This book was nothing like I thought it was going to turn out. The beginning of the book had me cracking up laughing at how the twins were acting. As the I read on, the book got better and better and befor I knew it, I was through. It is a must read for everone."
1,The worst Buffy book to date,"I own ever Buffy the Vampire Slayer book published and most of the books are really good, but this one is really bad. The plot is sub-par at best, and the writting makes one not even want to finish the book, I an avid Buffy fan could't even sit through this one. If you have to give up a book give this one up, only buy to complete a collection like me."
3,women in the west did stuff,"I had to read this for a class. I found this book to be pretty boring. I guess it is the best out there, however, so it is probably worth the read."
4,Probably the best to come out of France,"This live album has got all a live album needs. Not only does France Gall sing just like you imagine a Frenchwoman would do, she also charms her fans with nice little stories and fantasies, and she is joined by the Phoenix Horns and Doudou N'Diaye Rose who really add some spice to her nice songs.Much of this album is inspired by blues and jazz. And some of the songs are blown up to double length, without ever becoming pretentious. The highlights are Amor Tambien, Big Fat Mama and Ella, Elle L'A - the last one being a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald.One regret though: the original vinyl double album contains 13 songs - the CD contains only 11. Not too wise!"
1,Don't order this item unless you like blue!,"I ordered 3 rolls of this border because my son's favorite character is SpongeBob and his favorite color is red. The order was shipped in a timely fashion, but to my dismay, the rolls are blue, not red. I've spoken to HomeVisions 5 times begging for assistance and it's useless -- they have my 55 bucks, I have 3 rolls of blue wallborder I don't want or need. They keep promising to call me back, keep promising to find out if this pattern comes in red (um, I think it does, the picture on the website clearly shows red), keep promising to send me a free postage return label, but so far... zilch.The photos for this item are misleading and this item should be edited to show the blue border OR removed from Amazon entirely.If you want this pattern in blue, you should receive it promptly with no problems, but if you're looking for red, don't waste your time and money!"
4,The title doesn't match the book,"This is an interesting piece of fiction about a little-known cast of historical characters in medieval Scotland. Why it is entitled ""Crusader"" I just don't get as the crusades are only mentioned as something far away and in the future for most of the book. A little plodding on detail and cast of political characters, but an absorbing look into another side (besides England's) of Great Britain's monarchial history."
2,Not loud enough,"Although this timer has some great features, it has some real drawbacks. The first is that it is not loud enough. If you usually cook in silence it may be fine, but it's easy to miss if the television is on or music is playing.I also have trouble with the design. If the timer is on the frig, manipulating the buttons is very awkward. I think a left-handed person would find it even more so. The only easy way to manipulate the buttons is to hold it in my hand, which I find inconvenient, as it means I need two clean hands instead of just one."
5,"This Dvd is tearin up so much a**, and its not even movin","If you love ATHF, then you should already own this product, and if you don't, get to ordering."
1,Very small!,I only use my wheelchair when I have to carry items from one location to another. I bought this product hoping I wouldn't have to carry my drinks in my pockets anymore. But this product is so small. It won't carry a standard travel mug and it is very difficult to get it to hold a pop can. I am very disappointed in this item and the price is absolutely ridiculous. I would expect a better quality of product for the amount they are asking for this. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!
4,Excellent Little E.P,"While this isn't as necessary as the full albums by Whiskeytown, it's as good as ""Rural Food Delivery"" and a must listen for fans, especially the top notch ballad ""Wither, I'm a Flower"", which more than anything else lead me to track down this album. The asking price is a bit steep right at the moment, but if you watch carefully, you might catch it, even now, at a reasonable price."
5,no other will do,"My husband swears by this stuff and I finally tried it, and I must say, it is quite tasty! We've tried other chocolate ones (liquid and powder) and this really does taste the best -- unfortunatly, not all grocery stores have it so we were thrilled to be able to get it here."
2,Seriously people??,"Why do I keep getting suckered in to buy things because of positive reviews? Well, thank goodness I didn't buy the 6 pack. From reading all these positive reviews, I went out and bought a jar of this creamer at Target ($3.59). I was using Bailey's chocolate creamer but thought I would try this because of the reviews and the fact it doesn't have to be refrigerated like the Bailey's. This stuff has a mild chocolate flavor at best and that from adding about 4 tablespoons. It does not taste great. Trust me, if you want a chocolate coffee creamer that actually gives you a nice chocolate flavour then the Bailey's creamer is the best. I will be back to buying Bailey's and this crap is going in the garbage."
5,DELISH!!,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS CHOCOLATE CREAMER FOR THE PAST YEAR NOW. IT IS SOOOO GOOD! I CAN'T DRINK MY COFFEE WITHOUT IT. I STARTED BRINGING A JAR TO WORK TO KEEP AT THE COFFEE STATION. EVERY BODY LOVES IT. I BUY 2 SIX PACKS AT A TIME. MY HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER DRINK IT AS WELL. TRY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT! IT IS GREAT WITH A LITTLE FRENCH VANILLA CREAMER ADDED TO IT AS WELL. IT IS LIKE DRINKING DESSERT. YUM!"
3,Where's the chocolate?,"I'm somewhat disappointed in this stuff. I see nothing but rave reviews, but I must be missing something here.I ordered it expecting a mocha like flavor. Instead, I taste Coffee-Mate creamer. Which is okay. It smells somewhat of chocolate...But I don't taste the chocolate flavor I expected. Turns out, there is more sodium caseinate than cocoa in it. And both of those ingredients are after the ""less than 2%"" statement. Bummer.All of that said, it still tastes okay. Just don't expect it to replace a coffeehouse mocha."
4,After the fire,"In this fifth installment of the series, the ladies are well settled into their new home after their original one burned. As usual there are problems. Hannah and Amelia begin to bicker, Hannah receives an upsetting diary which brings up past sorrows, and Grace is grieving over a death. The ladies go on a cruise, but they return to the same problems after their vacation is over. There are some things to celebrate, such as the birth of a baby and a wedding date being set. In my opinion, the subplots concerning Grace's young friend, Lucy, are a bit awkward and seem out of place, and the one in this book is no exception. I feel that the books are popular because they show that senior citizens can still lead active and useful lives and the characters comprise a warm and intertwined extended family. There is a lack of literature written for and about this age group and these books fill that need."
4,Nice!,excellent razor - particularly for the money -Gives just as good (if not better) cut than myexpensive one...
1,Cadmium rechargeable battery issue,"I was very happy with this razor, for a short time.The cadmium battery that comes with the charger has a very limited useful life.Cadmium batteries, for those who do not know, have a ""memory"".Unlike Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, the Cadmium batteries do not charge back to 100% and will continually decrease its charge capabilities over time.My razor did not make it past the 6 month mark. I will charge it for days, and it will feel like the battery is charged at about 20%. 20% power does not effectively work.Do Not Buy! Get a corded razor, or one with a Nickel Metal Hydride battery."
1,Possibly the worst shaver in the world?,Mine has just stopped working after about 12 months - and it now shaves as well as it did when it was working. The trimmer didn't cut long hairs and the normal blades didn't cut short hairs - just irritate my skin.Suspect I know why it's cheap.
3,Excellent shave but no corded use,"My da-307 replaced a da-407 that I have had for 12+ years. The battery on da-407 died a long time ago but I was very happy using it corded. However, my new da-307 will not run corded. Once da-307 battery dies I will need to replace the entire unit even though the rest of the mechanics work fine. This is not an environmentally conscious design. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the da-307.Edit: I ended up returning the unit. I did not like the fact that it would not work corded. I purchased a Remington F720 instead."
2,Disappointing Shave,"My dad's Remington Titanium MS2-370 needed replacement blades, but at the same price we could get the Remington DA-307. I bought the DA-307. There is no comparison. While the MS2-370 has dual blades, the DA-307 has a single double-cutter. As another reviewer mentioned, you have to go over the same area repeatedly to get most of the hairs cut. I just used it and gave up after mowing over and over, with an incomplete shave. I'll be purchasing the replacement blades for the MS2-370 after all."
4,remington shaver,This is a good shaver for the price--I would say it compares well with shavers much more expensive
1,Remington DA307 electric razor,"I think this product may be a ""rip off"". Compared to my old razor of the same type, it sounds funny, too fast and too high pitched. At start up, it smells like an electrical appliance that is overheated."
3,Remington DA-307,"I had been looking for the same style razor I previously used for 20+ years (i.e. a DA-107) which is the same body sytle as the DA-307, just not rechargable. The plastic head piece that holds the screen had broke. The charges on the DA-307 would only last about 4 or 5 days. After ~2 weeks using the DA-307 and losing a charge in the middle of a shave, I could'nt take it any longer. I swapped the new head, screen, and blade onto my DA-107 and presto - back in business. I never really wanted to get a rechargable in the first place. Other than that, I really like the Remingtons."
3,Gift for my Husband,"I purchased this for an alternative to my Husband 'razor' shaving, thought he might like it when he was in a hurry, or just for a touch-up, he really likes it, he rates it a 3 star as it is adequate, but for use everyday, he would probably want a more expensive one. For the price, however, and his needs at this time, it has performed well."
2,not the razor for a close shave,"Unlike another reviewer, I didn't find this the very worst I have ever owned; but it certainly isn't the best! Keep looking..."
4,Remington Razor,I wish it came with the little brush cleaner for hair remains but its still a great razor. If you cant get to very small hairs the trimmer on the back works nice.
4,This is my fifth,"The Remington DA-307 as been around for longer then I have been shaving,I'm 68.It started out as a non re-chargeable ( my father had one ) It gives a very close shave once your beard gets used to it.But you must replace the the foil screen every six months.Here's a tip, a new shaver cost about three dollars more then a new foil screen.You can get about five shaves or more on a charge but I like to shave with a full charge.Wash your face,then dry it. Apply some talcum power with a soft brush.I use my wife's old make-up brush but you can use the old fashioned shaving mug brush.More often then not one or two hairs that you missed on your last shave have grown too long for the foil to capture it so I touch up with a safety razor on my dry skin.The side pop out trimmer is great for us guys that sport a mustache.Don't be turned off my Amazon's low price this is one good product for the price."
1,Item substituted,"The blue shaver pictured is no longer available. A gray one was substituted without querying me. Item was received with NO papers for possible return or contact information. The color may seem inconsequential but if it's for someone who's 87 years old and doesn't know it's his shaver if it isn't blue, it's very important and the only reason I ordered it. Even though it's no longer available, one month later it's still on their website and says ""In Stock""."
3,Remington DA 307,"I used the razor for about 3 weeks. Found it excessively noisy. It shaved OK but missed longer hair if I missed a day shaving. I sent it back and went back to a mid-range Norelco (much quieter, better if I miss a day shaving, altho more costly)."
4,Good combo of pop and Mariachi style music,"I enjoyed the ballads on this album, and the ones with a hint of Mariachi style music were a real treat. I bought this CD for my Mom as well and she loves it!"
4,Upbeat and fun,"I was at a festival in Ensenada Mex. where Ernesto performed recently. I liked what I heard and picked up the album. It features a number of upbeat songs, but there are many good romantic ones too. A great album if you like Latin pop."
3,Believe or not....,"I don't think this book was as good as the others in the two of a kind series. This one was kind of boring, and not as exciting as the other ones. I think you should buy it if you like the series. I'm not saying it's bad, but it's just not the best one."
3,An OK book!! (A reader who is 13 years old),"Hey! The reason I got this book was because I am a collector and I wanted to fulfill my collection. I personally liked reading this book, but my cousin, who is eight years old did not. She said it was boring, so I agreed with her to be the same!! But, I think I did like it though. It was an ok book. I think I liked Likes Me, Likes Me Not the best!! :) That was good. I have 31 books!! It's awesome to be a collector! If you are a true fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, then collect their books!!"
1,Deffective.. TWICE!!,I recieved this as a gift and the first one would play the cd for about a minuite and then stop and show 00 on the display that is supposed to shown ( and initially would show) how many tracks are on the cd. I contacted amazon and they mailed me a replacement and a return label for the first one. I tried out the new one and it never even acknowledges that there is a cd in the unit at all and would spin for a second or two and then show 00 on the display and never play at all.I am very dissapointed in this item and think that the entire product line must be defective.I really hate that I have to return a gift at all. What I want to do is get a different cd player or gift certificate but I dont know if Amazon will let me do that yet... since it was a gift from someone.. but I am trying.I DO NOT RECCOMEND getting this item at all. Very Disapointing and not worth the hassle.
1,crap,"This unit worked well for a month or so then started stopping in the middle of a song. Sometimes it will start again - other times it will not play no matter what you do. The radio is just about useless as the tuning is so tight it is hard to line up a station. I have to say the alarm worked well as long as you put it on buzzer and not cd. Overall, spend a few extra bucks and get a better unit."
1,not received,I have not received the magazine as of yet! I am not too hapy with that. Check back with me when I receive it.
3,Should have gotten the speed one,I was expecting the on the field helmet which is slightly different. It's still good for decoration but I think that Ill buy the speed one before getting any autographs.
4,Just what I've always wanted,"I wanted a mouse for my kids' computer. We had a Kidzmouse, but it broke after a couple years. An ""indestructible"" mouse seemed like a perfect replacement. The scroll buttons are not as nice to use as a mouse wheel, but then again, my preschoolers aren't surfing with the same intense, frenzied need for information gathering as dad. It works well for them and well enough for me."
1,Washable Computer Mouse,This mouse was totally unacceptable. I purchased it for use at work becuase there are multiple users on the computer I use. It was difficult to move about with or without mouse pad. None of the users liked this and we went back to the old style. The difficulty were the soft plastic nubs on the bottom. Have no idea why they were incorporated into this mouse. Others don't have these.
5,"QUICK DELIVERY, EXCEPTIONAL CONDITION",I was veryy happy to find this item available on amazon. The price was extremelyyy reasonable and the seller delivered it SOO QUICKLY and it arrived in perfect condition. SO SO happy with this purchase!!!! Thank you! :)
4,Psychopathy from a Psychotherapeutic View,"Not a bad read, although not entirely coherent, Goldberg searches for meaning and answers concerning the socially deviant. Although very informative, honest, and idealistic, Goldberg fails to find methods of empirical value to support his ideas. On the other hand, from a psychotherapeutic point of view, I can see where he is coming from entirely. Goldberg has a great understanding, and achieves at conveying his knowledge of shame and what debilitating effects it can have on its victims. The book is basically a compilation of his own cases with a focus of Goldberg's individual analysis. Overall, an excellent read for anyone interested in psychopathy, crime & deviance, and psychotherapy."
3,"Low price and looks good, but quality is not great","We ordered two of these cages for our second home. The cages arrived quickly and were pretty easy to assemble, but the quality is not great. The holders for the food bowls are pretty flimsy and arrived bent. We had to wiggle them around (bending them more) to make them fit through the side doors. One of the fittings on the bottom of the leg that holds the caster was also damaged and had to be removed in order to get the caster in. Finally -- it's important to note that while this is a large cage, it might not be appropriate for a very large bird or a cockatoo as a large macaw could probably bend the food holders, and a cockatoo might dismantle the cage as all of the bolts/nuts are easily accessible."
3,play top wrought iron bird cage,beware that this bird cage will come in 2 shipments we had no idea and amazon didn't know either first part of the cage came and about 3 days later the rest of it came all the parts were there One leg was badly bent the feeding dishes are plastic the holders that you put the plastic bowls in were bent but because the medal is thin it was easy to bend them back besides all that the cage is nice size everything as far as the door and the opening for the food dishes all work fine this cage is good for the money you cant get a bird cage this size for the price I still worry about the bent leg but all and all its worth the chance so the rating I give it is a 3 for the bent leg and that I had to wait so long to receive it
5,My Mother's Child - What a great read!,"When I began reading this debut book written by Stella Hatgiannis, I had not fathomed how intensely absorbing and fascinating the subject matter was. I felt as if I were stepping back in time, to my own childhood, as vivid scenes of her Greek American childhood unfolded before me.I loved the way each chapter represented a phase in her life. There were tears and laughter, defiance and humility. The ice cream wagon, the twins and their parasols, the stranger who visited, causing her to hide in her room, all these were delightful short stories with a running thread - My Mother's Child. The ending was quite sad and at the same time empowering, for even as grown ups, we all are our Mother's children, aren't we?I recommend this book highly and look forward to reading more of this author's works."
5,A Really Good Bargain,"I am very pleased with my keyboard cover. The fit is great and so is the fabric its made of. Overall this was a good purchase, well worth the price."
3,Really only for insurance sales people,"When I bought this book, I was not aware that the basis for the book was really just from the insurance perspective. I was hoping that his ""Wedge"" technique would have been more universal, but I do not think it is. So, if you are in the financial or service sectors, this book should work for you; but if not, I would skip it and try some others."
3,A little pricey for what you get,"I'm not a seasoned sales guy, but I am a business owner that found the material repetitive and pretty basic. I thought the book could have been condensed in about half the space. It seems the going rate is $30 for this book (not much less for used) - so I had pretty high expectations, which fell a little short.Perhaps I'm just a simple guy or not smart enough to glean all I should have from this book. I'll probably keep it in my library to re-read another time - but don't expect to get too much more out of it.This is just my opinion... so it's worth just that :-)"
2,Lacked Pizazz,"Cinderella has always been my favorite fairy tale, which is why I was so looking forward to a new twist on it. However, while this book had some clever ideas the writing was less than thrilling and many of the themes needed more explanation. I did not really care about the characters and felt they needed more depth."
4,I liked this book.,"The story line was interesting, the inclusion of art was something that drew me right in, but one thing irritated me about this book. When making people speak, the author would leave out personal pronouns! Also I found his writing style a little choppy. But as I said earlier, the story line is wonderful, I would have liked it to be longer."
2,Still Reading...,"I'm not too far into the book, but so far I'm bored out of my mind. It seems like a chore to read it. I hope it gets better soon!"
4,Enjoyable,"The beginning was hard for me to get through, ( I think because of it being written in a different style than what I normally read ) but about halfway through I couldn't put it down. I loved Wicked, and that's why I wanted to read this. I was not disappointed. Such memorable characters! I will definitely read more of his books!"
4,CONFESSIONS OF AN UGLY STEPSISTER--GREGORY MAGUIRE,"This novel is the story of Iris, a young woman who runs away from England with her mother, Margerethe, and her retarded sister, Ruth, to Holland. Margerethe becomes the housekeeper of a tulip salesman, Mr. Van den Meer. When his wife dies and he marries Margerethe, Van den Meer's daughter turns to the warmth of the kitchen for solace. Iris befriends the young girl, Clara, and helps her get back out into the world by sending her to a ball. But the prince hosting it falls in love with Clara...A sad but well-written tale, Maguire once again shows us he loves doing fractured faery tales. Don't read this if you expect the old story of 'The Ashgirl'."
3,Decent,Started out slow but ended up to be a very satisfying and surprising read. Would recommend if you're a fan of the author.
3,Lacking a connection,"Not as good as I expected it to be. Like Wicked, it took me a while to get into the story, but I never really got to the point where I cared about the characters. Set in Holland in the 17th century, the story is told from the point of view of Iris, a plain girl who has fled England with her mother and sister after the death of her father. Her mother is manipulative and self-serving, her sister mute and physically challenged. Her mother manipulates herself into a position in the house of a tulip merchant, and quickly dispatches his wife. His daughter is sheltered, stuck up, and rather unlikable, but beautiful. The story progresses, but I found it hard to care too much."
4,Thought Provoking: What about those stepsisters?,"17th-century Holland, depicting wonderful Dutch culture and history, is the setting of the mysterious viewpoint of the ""ugly stepsisters"" and their complex histories and personalities. This beautiful version recognizes why we have compassion and pity for poor Cinders while opening our hearts to her ""mean & ugly"" stepsisters. The (up to the present time) unseen stepsisters and their extraordinary love and conflict with their ""changeling sister"" is the most outstanding of the strong threads carrying the story, especially as she (Cinders/Clara) is not relegated to the status of servant by her self-serving stepmother; she chooses it for herself.Kudos to illustrator Bill Sanderson. The cover and interior art is simply amazing. Once again, a book I initially reached for due to the beautiful, intriguing cover."
1,really crap,"this is such a terrible book! no plot, it was incredibly boring, i struggled to get through it.i really don't know what all the other reviewers were thinking! not to mention the ""reader's group guide"" inside, what's that about? it's like a text book!and the illustrations were poor reproductions of authentic ""ye olde world"" prints. very bad. it was a pain to read, i am glad no one recommended it to me, i just picked it up, and am i sorry i did! don't waste your time!"
1,Stick with the real Cinderella version,"I picked this book up with the excitement that it would share the ugly stepsisters side of things, but keep the basic plot the same as most Cinderella stories. However, this was not Cinderella. In this Clara is rude, and seems like a brat. The ending doesn't make her seem very much better either.It was difficult to care for any of the characters except maybe Iris, who at times seemed a little bit of a brat as well. I'm open to other versions of this story, but this is definately not anything really close to Cinderella. I'd suggest reading Elle Enchanted or watching Ever After. Those two versions are amazing and in Ever After you even have a stepsister who is kind and one can care deeply about."
1,Wasted My Money,The title was the best part of this book. Not worth purchasing - if you MUST read it check it out from the library or borrow it. Don't ask me for it - mine is headed for Goodwill because I can not stand to burn or trash a book. It was awful and vulgar. Very disappointed. I hope someone else writes the book to fit the title. Unfortunately I bought two books by the author and was disappointed with BOTH!
1,Too slow for words!!!,I just hated this book. It went on and on and on. I finally gave up. It is in a box in my basement somewhere. Maybe someone in the future will have the time to sift through this boring story. Don't waste your time on it... Yuck!
1,You really want to know what I think of this book?,"It stinks! How did this crock EVER find a publisher? Affected, pretentious, pompous, silly, a complete and utter waste of time...and that was about the part I liked! Next time this author shows up at another writer's refuge (offering peace, quiet and completely free accommodation) with his latest grant in hand, someone tell him that the Emperor has no clothes. Force this poseur to find a job."
4,Confessions an interesting twist,"This is an enchanting and dark story. It plays an interesting twist on the whole Cinderella and her ugly stepsisters story. The Cinderella in this story is beautiful but she is sulky, odd, and bratty. The stepsisters are ugly on the outside but very complex girls and not as ugly on the inside. The story is well written and the author does a good job of immersing you into another world. There is also a very interesting storyline about painting portraits and a master artist who enjoys painting the macabre and the bizarre, including the ugly stepsisters and ""Cinderella."" I would recommend this story and the surprise twist at the end."
4,slow but good,"I thought the book was very slow, but I found the detail in it was worth the read. Each character seem to be fully explained. I especially enjoyed the ending. (which I can't explain more on, for obvious reasons).I enjoyed it a lot more than the typical Cinderella story. Its an in depth description of all that happened before the ball, how our Cinderella was created and the bigger roles the stepsisters and mother played in her life."
4,good twists to a familiar fairy tale,"I suggested this book for a book club and everyone commented that they really enjoyed the story! One person did not like the style in which it was written but everyone else enjoyed that aspect. It took me awhile to really get into the book, although I enjoyed it from page 1. But once I got through 3/4 of it, I couldn't put it down. Surprising and very entertaining! I would suggest it to anyone that likes drama, humor, suspence, and fairy tales!"
5,A brilliant novel!,"There is no way to accurately describe the beauty of the thoughts that come from Gregory Maguire's mind. He is a truly talented author, and this book is a brilliant sequel to his equally wonderful ""Wicked"". The most important part of Maguire's talent is his ability to appeal universally, explained best by this critic of fantasy writing who counts his two novels as two of the five best ever!"
1,Book will not download,"The book arrived in my iPad, but will not download. Can I get a copy that actually will show up in a form I can read please?"
2,"boring, boring, boring","i thought this book would tell an exciting story based on the classic fairytale ""cinderella"". it did tell a tale but it was soo very slow that i couldn't wait for it to end so i could read something else. maguire does develop the characters and story that precede the magnificent ball in the classic tale. what he fails to do is make you give a damn about any of the characters so the story makes little or no positive impression on you. i was bored from the get go and only finished it because it was a book club book. don't think i have the gumption to read ""wicked"" despite the positive reviews i've read on amazon.com."
2,Wicked it is not,"This story had a lot of promise, a great beginning, a tolerable middle, and a complete let down of an ending in which Cinderella becomes a harlot in a back salon and then produces a series of brat princes and princesses as little more than an ordinary although royal housewife. It's hard to love or care for any of the characters as they are all so 2 dimensional. We see only symptoms of problems rather than their roots and are left with little or no resolution for most of them. I was so excited to see this book after reading Wicked, but now having read this, I am leary of diving into Mirror Mirror."
4,"The ""other side"" of the story","Although it did not have the same dark feel as Wicked, Confessions was a wonderful twist on a common fairytale. The ""other side"" of the story told from the traditional villain's point of view, once again, fascinated me. It had a very ""behind the scenes"" feel to it. I highly recommend it."
3,A Disappointment,"Wicked remains one of my favorite books of all time, but I have to agree with the readers who say that Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister does not live up to Gregory Maguire's first novel. It was a disappointment for me, and sad to say, I put the book down before I finished it about 3/4 of the way through. The tone of this novel is too false, too contrived. It has none of the surprise of Wicked, the sheer joy of discovery that Wicked had. Perhaps it's unfair to judge an author's book by the one that preceded it, but I suppose it's only human, especially when you have such high expectations. I will, however, attempt to finish the book (someday) and would take a chance on Mr. Maguire's writing again when he publishes another book."
3,ehh...,"I didn't hate this book enough to abandon it, and I am proud to say that I finished the whole thing. I guess my main gripe is that the book was just ""ehh"" it wasn't too exciting and it wasn't too boring. I wouldn't call it a page-turner, I probably didn't really care too much about any of the characters and never really felt compelled to root for any of them. I loved the concept, but I think it could have been handled better."
3,Confessions of a Pessimist,"As someone who had no desire to read this book, I was delightfully surprised. Forced to read it as it was a selection chosen for a book club, I ended up liking it. It is the retelling of the classic Cinderella, but told from a different vantage point-one of the Ugly Stepsisters. In a clever twist on there being two sides to every story, the concept of this novel gives the reader a whole new perception of what the Cinderella story could have been about. Although not the magical fairy tale of Disney's Cinderella, the author was able to keep the fairy tale essence in his writing style. This book was unique and thoughtful."
2,Very dark retelling.,"This was a great book. That said, I absolutely hated it. It's strange, being able to recognize that something is very good but still to hate it. I feel the same way about Steinbeck and the movie 21 Grams.The characters were vivid and deep and interesting, which is greatly important to me. The story was very dark, and I guess I may need to consider the possibility that such a dark story is simply not to my taste. I found this book to be one of the most draining I've ever read, with Wicked still up there as number one. I still have Mirror Mirror on my shelf waiting to be read, because I keep thinking that as talented as this author is, maybe I'll like other pieces of his work, but isn't the definition of insanity to do the same thing repeatedly and expect a different result? Maybe I'll give that other book to a friend."
5,Lost in your world,From the start I was swept back in time and eager to turn the page! Great read! Maguire does an excellent job of telling a common story in an extraordinary way.
4,wonderful read,"This is a worthy successor to Wicked, in many ways superior. Maguire has again twisted a well known tale on its head. He has much to say about beauty. All of the characters (save one, who is veiled in mystery, and turns out to be key to the story at its climax) are richly painted, and we see their strengths and weaknesses. None is entirely good; none is entirely evil; none is entirely as they seem. The character who portrays the mother of the two ""ugly stepsisters,"" Marguerethe, is particularly well-developed. The story leaves you wondering at many key points: what REALLY happened to the character whom we relate to as Cinderella to make her the way she is? Maguire's prose at times is a bit over-dense, over full of itself. And the ending, as some have observed, seemed to me rushed, and not quite what I had hoped for. But all in all, a very good read. 4.5 stars."
3,Letdown,"This story was a moderately entertaining twist on the classic cinderella but after Wicked I felt it was a letdown. However, the compelling last chapter was a true winner. I am glad that I read it but if you have to choose Wicked is definitely better."
4,A great tale,Maguire has done an excellent job in presenting a well known tale in an entirely new manner. This is a must read for anyone who has seen Disney's Cinderella and wondered about the truth behind the two ugly stepsisters.
3,Disappointing Sequel,"Wicked remains one of a handful of my favorite books of all time. It made one question all ones preconceived notions not only about The Wizard of Oz, but also about the nature of good and evil. In Confessions, however, Maguire seems to have fallen prey to all the pitfalls he avoided so successfully in Wicked. Where that book seemed profound, subversively clever, beautifully written, and skillfully avoided the whiff of ridiculousness, this book unfortunately fails in all those categories. Indeed, it seems so slight beside the other volume that one begins to wonder if the first book was truly as amazing as it seems; and yet I think it was. Maguire's style is off here, though: much of the book seems merely sketched in and not very deeply felt. In Wicked, Elphaba was alive; here, the characters seem to exist only to serve Maguire's whims, and whatever long-cherished notion he's trying to deconstruct seems to get lost in the translation"
3,that's it?,"About a year ago I read Wicked and since then have told all my friends about it. So when I saw that Confessions was available, I rushed to buy it. This weekend I sat down and read it cover to cover and I have to say, it didn't live up to the standards of Wicked. I don't think that it had the same depth in the story. Had I read this story first I would have probably loved it, but alas, my expectations were high."
2,"Loved the Wicked series, thought I would give his other books a try...","I must say that I am extremely disappointed with this book. I LOVED the Wicked series (though, I haven't had the chance to read the final book yet) and was fairly excited to learn that he has written other books as well. I love ""fairy tales with a twist."" This book was in stock at my local library, and I was stoked. Then I read it. I can be an extremely fast reader, especially if the book I'm reading is captivating...but this was a whole different story. I finished this one quickly, because simply put, it was extremely short. Absolute snore fest. I couldn't believe this was the same author. So thankful I didn't go out and waste my money by purchasing this book like I had his others. Don't waste your time."
3,Not So Wicked,"Sister, sister-why did you treat me like this? To tell the truth, to me the plot in this book plodded. I will give this book to my little girl & see if she likes it."
2,Disappointing ending (non spoiler),"I enjoyed the book immensely, until the end. There was so much rich, authentic detail, interesting setting in Holland during the Tulip Craze, and new sympathy and a new way of looking at the characters.What was a real downer was the ending. After some scenes of intense tension, the ball, the prince, the disguise, etc, there's a climactic scene of confrontation back at home where some very upsetting secrets are revealed, and then-- huh?? What? That's it? It's over!It's like we never get to actually see what happens. It's like the last chapter is missing.There's a flashback summary in an old lady's voice, reminiscing about the other long-dead characters, from which we can figure out what happened.But after getting so into the story, I would have liked to experience the ending too."
3,Interesting But Not So Good,"I was pretty excited when I came across this book at a used book store. I thought I had a real gem and was appreciating my luck. I should sell the book back, but I don't want someone else to have the same false hope as I did. It's not a good book. It was interesting, la di da, but it wasn't that great. After finishing it, I was just like ""hm. ok"" I've mentioned the book to my friends in passing (after they mentioned Wicked). They were impressed and excited but probably could feel how unenthusiastic I was about the book and decided not to waste their time too."
3,Meh,"In this retelling of Cinderalla, a mother and her two daughters flee their village in England to Holland, in hopes of finding shelter at a relative's house. When they arrive, penniless, they find that their relative had died a few years ago, and their hope of a safe home vanishes.Margarthe (the mother) finally finds a job as a cook and housekeeper at the painter Schoonmaker's house, and is told she can stay if her eldest daughter Ruth keeps on bringing fresh flowers daily and her other daughter Iris, poses for a painting.Iris' painting leads them to a different house, where the Van Den Meers live a more luxurious life. Their only daughter, Clara, is convinced she is a changeling and the three girls befriend each other.I liked the first part of the book, when the family was living with the Painter, but then quickly lost interest after that. I don't know whether it was the writing style or the plot, but things just seemed to drag on and on"
4,SO CREATIVE!,After reading the Wicked Series I wanted to read Maguire's other books. This was the first that I read and although it was slow at times it was well worth trudging through it! Maguire's spin on Cinderella is so creative and imaginative! I had a very had time putting it down toward the end.
5,Exqusite Work!!!,This was surely one of the best books I have ever read!! It was so well written that I couldn't bear to put it down. I haven't yet read Wicked but I know that it'll hopefully be just as good as Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister. The Story related to the Cinderella story in a way but there were quite a few differences in it. I hope that everyone will read this book and experience for themselves how good it is!!! It's right up there on my list along with the Harry Potter series!!
5,You Must Read This One.,"Absolutely Wonderful! Maquire's writing gets better with each book! I know most of us have heard and can recite the Cinderella story but Maquire makes you see things much differently. The wicked stepsisters become the ""fairy godmother"", whilst preserving the primary theme. The ending was a surprise for me on who was telling the tale."
5,"See ""Cinderella"" from a new and different view...","I tend to like it when authors take traditional stories with famous protagonists and tell it all from another point of view (recent examples include The Red Tent, The History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters). This book is no exception. In fact, it's intriguing because it shows that even in ""fairy tales"", things are not necessarily black and white. There isn't a good guy or a bad guy...just lots of grey folks in between (notice that the title is Confessions of an *Ugly* Stepsister, not a wicked one). Whole people, with virtues as well as faults. You end up having sympathy for just about every character in this tale. I think I'll be reading Wicked real soon."
4,Wonderfully cynical look at Cinderella,"I love that Gregory Mcguire made one of the step-sisters the main character, not Cinderella. It really shows how she looked at cinderella, and how Cinderella was not portrayed as a victim of the step-sisters. It is an all around great book, I just could not put it down until I was finished with it. I highly recommend it."
3,Confessions...,Have not read this book yet but if it is as good as the other books by Maguire then I know I will enjoy it!
2,Blah Blah Boring,"Ugly Stepsister was the reading choice of my book club and it was roundly disliked. The choice was based on the much better received Wicked, which I have not read.The book was extremely slow to start. Although the characters were interesting, the writing itself was flat and uninspiring. It took me four weeks just to get through the first 100+ pages. By the date of the book club, seven weeks after I started the book, I still hadn't finished. In fact, the only reason I finished it was that I'd promised my fellow club members I would.Our next book club read is Middle Sex (or Middlesex), which I hope is a better read. I can't imagine it will be much less entertaining. Thank goodness Harry Potter is being delivered next week so I can get the memory of Ugly Stepsister out of my head!"
2,So so,"This book wasn't a book that I would normally read, and it was okay. I thought it would be more of a humerous book than what it was. The middle of the book was kind of slow going and was wondering when it would start to pick up, but towards the end the book got better. It made me want to watch the movie Cinderella again. I haven't seen it in years."
3,Good!,"This book was Good but not great as I was expecting it to be. I read this for my bookclub selection and was a little disappointed. It was written well, a little choppy at times but reletively easy to follow. It was the language that I found boring, and also the storyline was a little drab. Okay the storyline concept was brilliant but it was not executed properly."
3,Imaginative but Long,"Maguire does a nice job of painting the sisters as woeful humans and Cinderella as this spoiled little girl, but the book runs too long. It was imaginative of him to design such a twist to the original piece, though. Props for creativity."
3,Revenge of the UGLIEST stepsister,"This contained less intrigue than Wicked and was certainly an easier read. Maquire puts a new spin on the classic Cinderella tale with this story revolving around art, tulips, and a love of beauty. I felt the allusions to the imp in the story would have added more to the story if there had actually BEEN an imp. Many loose ends were left dangling in the story, and I would have felt better about the plot if explanations had been given, but the ending provided a nice twist -- I'm not sure I'm totally convinced by the characterization of Ruth in the epilogue, but it's Maquire's story, I suppose."
3,Not What I had hoped for,"This book is well-written. It is a thoughtful re-telling of the old fairy tale, against a real historical background of Holland during the 17th Century Tulip Madness time. The historical details are right.What I was expecting was light, enchanting reading. What I got was a very dark, serious novel. I much liked Rosalind Laker's Golden Tulip as a great novel of this same time period, but I know Laker's Style and was not expecting a ""fairy tale"".I had not previously read any of Maguire's books, so didn't realize his style was so dark. I had read Mercedes Lackey's Fairy Godmother was expecting something in the same vein. Maguire is more realistic and that was not what I needed to read at this time.So - great book - but not to my taste."
2,Disappointing...,"After all the hype that followed Wicked, I felt compelled to pick this one up. Mistake!After getting through a fairly promising start to the book, it slogged on until the very end, where it got interesting again (if not wholly unrealistic).Not worth your time."
3,Not as good as Wicked - but not bad.,"I confess I lovedWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Harper Fiction). So, my expectations were high for this one. Where Wicked had interesting political re-interpretations, this one does not.It's not bad. It's still a unique re-interpretation of an old classic, with the focus on Maguire's truth of how the two ugly stepsisters in the classic Cinderalla story came to be these mythical, reviled women.Maguire's always had a long-winded style - in Wicked, I felt the story more than justified bearing with it. In this one, it's just barely bearable."
3,It was okay....,I really didn't find this book to be all that good. It was hard to read and follow and most of the time I was wishing the author would just get to the point and quit rambling. The concept was good (not quite like the Cinderella story we all know and love) but the author could have moved things along at a quicker pace. Would I recommend it? Like I tell everyone: you're your own critic.
3,"A Letdown After ""Wicked""","Gee, what a disappointment. As soon as I discovered that Maguire, who had written ""Wicked"", a brilliant revisionist telling of ""The Wizard of Oz"", had spun another tale, I couldn't wait to read ""Confessions."" Well...not bad. Just not up to ""Wicked."""
3,not 'Wicked',"A disappointing sophomore attempt at adult fiction. Maybe if you read this BEFORE ""Wicked"" it's pretty good, but after you read 'Wicked', your expectations for Maguire's next novel are too high for this one. It's luke-warm. Lacks the pace, subtlety, humor, and sexiness of 'Wicked'. Worth reading, but don't expect too much."
3,Not nearly as good as Wicked...,"After reading ""Wicked,"" I was eagerly looking forward to ""Confessions,"" and was disappointed. While ""Confessions"" does give a new twist on an old tale, it just doesn't come across as powerfully or irresistably as ""Wicked"" does. A decent book, but not one I'd highly recommend."
2,"Why so glum, Cinderella?","Maguire's retelling of the Cinderella tale is not without interest or insights. Despite the stilted dialogue, the characters become human. But the novel lacks humor and spirit. The story the author presents ultimately becomes as drained of spirit as its setting Holland is drained of seawater. It's a depressive interpretation. Cinderella's tale becomes one of scandal, but without tabloid titillation -- only a matter-of-fact sombreness. *SPOILER* What point is there in having the Prince deflower the Cinderella character at the ball? Just more proof to show what ""rats"" we mortals be? As for the book's ending twist, though it's unexpected and initially jawdropping, it's hard to swallow when you think about it."
4,Entertaining and Beautiful,"After a long (but good) semester of reading only classical greek literature, I looked to this book for a break. I got it because it seemed light and an easy read. It was a quick read, but at the same time immensely compelling. Maguire has an elegant sense of phrase and a skill for his craft. It definatly left me wanting more."
3,The ugly stepsister isn't so ugly after all...,"I'm glad I chose to read this book during my flight yesterday. It's one of those books that once you get into the first few chapters, you can't really put it down for a long period of time.Highlights: It's engaging, funny, and you really get attached to the main character. There's even a cute little love story in there (only marred by my anxiety that ""cinderella"" would steal the guy away with her looks.)Downsides: The ending was disappointing. It isn't told by Iris, who we get to know really well and have invested so much time in. I don't want a quick summary on what happened to Iris! The other main characters in the book aren't fleshed out very well, such as the father.Overall: Good read with likeable characters, you won't regret spending a day on this book."
4,A different spin on that classic story,"i must say that Mr. Maguire has a real gift for the imagination. This isn't anywhere near the Disney story, and yet it does shy away from the Hans C. Anderson telling too. And a nice little twist at the end, very unexpected! it's a short read, i read almost halfway through it while in the bath tub. it's really worth the read."
2,Slow storyline and rushed ending,"I was looking forward to this book but in the end, I was really disappointed. The action through 3/4 of the book moved at a snail's pace and then the end was rushed. The story was more about Iris than it was about Clara (which was fine and as it should be) but the end epilogue gave Iris a mere 2 paragraphs while Clara was talked about for almost a page and a 1/2. The story was incomplete- What actually happened to each of the characters? Why in the world did the author, Gregory Maguire, end the book so bluntly? You can tell there's more but what happened to it?I hope ""Wicked"" is better..."
4,fun read,This was a fun read. I enjoyed how the story incorporated some real characters and history to weave an enjoyable tale.
4,Watch out Cinders...,"Watch out Cinderella, these are the confessions of an ugly stepsister. Gregory Maguire has done it again with Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister.From the beloved writer of Wicked, Gregory Maguire has spun the tale of Cinderella's ugly stepsisters. Just like Wicked, Confessions shows both the black and white of a fairy tale. He goes into detail about the relationship between the 2 sisters and the beautiful sister.This is a great book for the 13+ crowd. It's not Wicked, but definitely take the second best book I've read by Gregory Maguire."
4,Another perspective,"Not sure why Maguire has so much to say about being a woman, but it's an entertaining read. A totally different perspective on the fairy tale (for awhile I wasn't sure how it was going to connect to Cinderella...but it does and it's unexpected)."
4,Delightful and Well Written,"Ah, sweet and simple! This novel was funny, beautifully written and enthralling. Touches of magic keep this novel lighthearted, though there are serious doses of realism. Love!"
3,fairy tale retelling,"this is an interesting retelling of Cinderella. Mr. Magire has taken the old story and given it a new spin. its told by one of the ""ugly Stepsisters"" and gives their perspective of what really went on."
4,Finally! A Different Side of the Coin!,"First things first, I'm not usually one for the hero of a story; I usually more side with the villians. I've just found the 'bad guys' to be more interesting.Second thing, for the most part, I am strong strongly AGAINST the whole Cinderella story, espeically the Disney version; I don't like the unconsiouse images that it represents, but this isn't where we discuss them.I read ""Confessions"" in a single day; in all honestly, I was enthrolled by the book because it was a different side of the coin. It took a different spin on the story and gave life to the stepsisters, and especially Iris. Gregory Mcguire made Irish real; some you could rally behind, some one you could have sympathy for; an underdog.I really liked this book, and if you want a different take, and aren't completely obsessed with the cleaned-up version Disney Cinderella, give this book a look through."
2,Overrated,"People had been raving to me about this author for months, and I was hyped to finally read one of his books, only to be let down greatly. He writes a good story, but doesn't actually write it all that well. While I liked the overall plot, it was very slow and tedious. The story takes far too long to actually catch your attention, and then is littered with pointless imagery that doesn't add to the story at all. (I.E. discribing how urine steams when it hits a cold floor)Truely, I did like the story, but I think he could have tried to write it better. In a high school writting class this would have easily been grade as a C."
2,disappointed somewhat,"I've read Wicked first and perhaps that was where the mistake lies. Wicked was so well written that after reading such a great novel, Confessions was somewhat of a disappointment. It's not a bad novel but the character development was just par and the storyline seemed a bit forced. I would love to recommend Wicked though for those who might be interested. I even bought the soundtrack from the Broadway show!"
1,Was I reading a different book?,"I think I must have been reading a different book, because for the life of me I can't understand what all of these people found to love here. I thought ""Confessions..."" was boring, dreary, and plotless. It just seemed to go on and on with no end in sight. Maybe I just didn't ""get"" it, but in my humble opinion this book is a definite miss."
4,Having a little fun with Cinderella,"It is fun to fool around with a classic fairy tale...especially one like Cinderella that has trancended cultures and generations. So, here is Cinderella told from the Ugly Stepsister's point of view. The book is a ""fast read"" with interesting characters and a clever twist to an age old story. And it poses the question, in a very interesting and non-preachy manner, ""Is there a price for beauty? Can beauty be a burden?""Not a brilliant book, but worth a read."
4,"A Story so smooth, like a Glass Slipper","I read 'Wicked' last week and now 'Stepsister'. I enjoyed 'Stepsister' as all 'story' and 'Wicked' as a more fleshed out ambitious novel. The characters in 'Stepsister' are more one dimensional than in Wicked. The story is the thing. I enjoyed both books. For pure fun I would pick Stepsister over Wicked. For a more complex, riveting and engaging novel - I would chose 'Wicked' Everything wraps up in 'Stepsister' neat and tidy- 'Wicked' leaves you wanting more. Suggestions for Mr. Maguire's next outing: Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel. Happy Reading."
3,Amusing,"EAP is not a particularly profound or serious book. It's more like a historical lark where we dance over the long history of the concept of evil. The author is rather funny, though; I found myself laughing out loud several times. EAP is a short and amusing book that you can zip through on a long layover or on a lazy afternoon.Not bad but not recommended."
3,"Not the entire collection, but at last glance this one was really cheap ""used""","There's Too Many ""Best Hits Collections"" of these guys. At last count there were more collections of Hooter songs than original albums issued. That's just plain WAKED. I suggest buying ""zig zag"", ""Nervous Night"" and ""One Way Home"" via the used venue here on amazon. This way you own ALL of the great music & YOU decide what their best hits are for yourself, don't let some record industry suit do it for you."
5,The Wavy Gravy Movie: Saint Misbehavin',"Delightful, well-made picture of one of our unsung American heroes. Hugh Romney, aka Wavy Gravy, embodies the best of the dreams and ideals of the counterculture, putting them into action. We truly need more great folks like him! If this movie doesn't inspire you, you might need to examine your conscience and reorder your priorities."
2,"Awesome case, aweful chipset","This particular enclosure is amazingly small compared it it's competition. Smallest I have seen ever, plus it doesn't use a giant power supply as is typical of most external drives. Just a little itty bitty cord.HOWEVERThe chipset it uses, Prolific PL3507 is easily the worst chipset ever. Do not buy this enclosure simply because it has this poor chipset. It will corrupt your drive as well as give you endless error messages. Don't believe me? Search for Prolific PL3507 on the web and you will see it is a problematic chipset for everyone who tries to use this drive via firewire.If you will only use USB2.0 then go for it. USB is much more reliable (most of the time) althought it will invariably be slower. DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT USE THIS ENCLOSURE OR ANY PROLIFIC CHIPSET IF YOU INTEND TO CONNECT THE DRIVE VIA FIREWIRE. IT WON'T WORK AND WILL CORRUPT ALL YOUR DATA (has been proven many times)."
1,So bad that I am writing my first product review,"I bought this enclosure at CompUSA, and any enclosed hard drive wouldn't mount when connected by firwire. I thought I might have gotten a bad one, but the previous review's warning about the poor chipset makes sense. I second the advice not to get this if you are going to use a firewire connection. Since USB-only enclosures are cheaper, I see no reason to spend money on this enclosure."
5,Good Product,"The keyboard cover is perfect for our needs. It fits, with room to spare, on our Casio CDP-220R. Recommended. It does not leave any lint, is fitted to keep it on and is just simple."
5,Fits Korg SP170,"When I ordered this cover I could not determine if it was large enough. It turns out that it is: it fits my Korg SP170.The cover's packaging gives the dimensions as 16"" x 48""."
5,Biased Review,"Hi, I am Ken Sheetz, director, writer, producer of Discover Me! The film took many twists and turns getting made over 4 years of highs and lows and could be a movie itself.What kept me going was exposing the sexual predators in the touching Sexual Politics segment of the show. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I did making it. I've had many people say it should be required viewing before coming to Hollywood.Please pass it on. This is not a film, despite the great talent, that Hollywood will distribute. You are our only hope for is to make our investment back.Namaste,Ken Sheetz"
3,Good Basic Resource,"This is a handy resource for professionals. The only problem is that it could use some updating. At the time this book was published, the ADA wasn't in place."
4,A Lifesaver- but a bit out of date,"This book was a lifesaver when it came to preparing for final exams. A very nice summary that hits all the major topics in Mental Health law. My only complaint is that it hasn't been updated since 97. So although most of the information is still accurate, it doesn't cover any of the more-recent developments in the law. Either way, if your struggling in a course, it's a great tool to have- just be aware that it was published in 1997, but I've looked and this was the best option I could find."
1,Dented and performs poorly,"The freezer arrived with gashes on both the right and left sides. Unacceptable for a brand new product but decided to try it anyway. The freezer performed very poorly, the lowest temp. it reached was 20 degrees. Returned the product which Amazon made very easy."
4,Getting Old But Works Great!,"The 2.33 GHz Macbook Pros that have Intel Core 2 Duo processors will be able to run MAC OS 10.7 (Lion) when it comes out. These computers are not as fast as the new quad core Macbook Pro models, but they continue to hold up to heavy use. I suggest maxing out the RAM to 4 GB before installing 10.7 this summer. These computers can actually only use 3.3 GB of the 4, but having matched pairs makes the RAM more efficient in these models. 2 GB seems to be fine for 10.6, but 10.7 will be a more intensive OS. People who do a lot of intensive movie editing may also want the additional RAM. I use my 2 GB computer with iLife '11 & on the Internet with no problems, but I don't know about the larger editing software such as Final Cut Pro."
3,A good collection of stories.,"I decided to read this book after I read Stephen Fair. Although The Book of Changes has many good stories, the stories weren't as well written as Stephen Fair.This collection is pretty good though becuase it covers a wide area of subjects, and there is something for everyone. Some stories are better than others as is the case of every short story collection, but the better stories in The Book of Changes are a bit hard to grasp.If you've never read Tim Wynne-Jones before, you should start with The Maestro or Stephen Fair. This short story collection would be more suitable for kids than young adults."
1,The stupefying 70's,"The only sensations provoked by the film are boredom, inanity and a feeling of wasted money.Save your money and feel a sense of pride."
3,great service from amazo,"I bought this for a friend who was happy to receive the phone, but unfortunately there was a problem with the first phone he received. The second, quickly dispatched, works great."
1,Poor quality phone,This is the worst piece of junk phone you can order. Get a can and a string it will work better.
4,Not the comprehensive guide it pretends to be,"This book is a survey of Greek philosophy from the pre- Socratics to Plotinus. It opens by telling the story of how Thales of Miletus and a group of Ionian thinkers began that inquiry into the character of the Universe which resulted in both Philosophy and Science. Warner is persuasive about the Greeks contribution to human civilization. But he does not go into detail on each writer. For Plato for instance he gives a long selection of the 'Meno' but does not really trace the overall development of Platonic thought. However he does provide a historical background to the thinking, and a general picture of each one with some excerpt of the work of the major thinkers.A fine work but not as detailed and complete as many other introductory works on the same subject."
2,Annoying velcro compartments,"There are two lens compartments in the bottom that are attached to the inside of the bag with velcro. That design was extremely annoying to me since the velcro was very strong and would not let go of the inside of the bag. That wass the main reason I returned the item. As for capacity, it does have enough room but not in a very convenient way. I bought this for a Pentax K-X with two lenses, one of which is a 55-300. That lens did not fit in the bottom compartments. So I needed to have the longer lens attached to the camera and in the top compartment. Then the shorter lens would go in one of the bottom compartments and the other one would be empty. Not very efficient for me. And again I emphasize, accessing the bottom compartments is extremely inconvenient because of the velcro design.The build quality however is excellent, very solid, and it looks great too."
3,Pentax camera bag,The quality of the bag is excellent. My only complaint is that it should be a little bit bigger. It is hard for me to fit in the camera body and 2 lenses.
3,There's hope for 30 something singles!!!,"Good book. Loved the interlinked ""short stories"". Having read all the relationship books that are hot these days, the final chapter was very hopeful!!! Easy beach reading with a bit of a dark side. Some easy reads are an insult to the intelligence but this is written skillfully and you'll gobble it up in one afternoon...."
2,Why do I care again?,"It's not like I have a short attention span, but I spent a majority of the book wondering why I was bothering to finish the book. Collection of short stories or not, it was too disjointed to grow an attachment to any of the characters.I guess I feel like I was being lectured by the author about why people feel the way that they do in relationships. It was pretty boring and I'm pretty surprised that it's being made into a movie."
2,What looked like a promising book was a disapointment,"I read this book up until page 104. Then all of a sudden the story jumps to some inane story that has nothing to do with Jane. This book should have kept going with the Jane character and not jumped in the middle of the book to another unknown story. And if Jane was so practical, why did she knowingly get involoved with this older man? The author really never quite tells us what Jane sees in him,what the attraction is. Promising book, but needs a good rewriting."
2,A Disappointing read,"While I wouldn't say reading this book was a waste of time, it definitely wasn't the best book I have ever read. The main character, Jane, is very endearing. She reminded me very much of myself as a teenager. However, I found the book to be very misleading. I was under the impression that the was a novel; instead it is a collection of short stories, and not a very good one at that.The stories do not seem to follow any particular chronological order, and I found the second story to be completely misplaced. What was the purpose of placing this story into the book? The ""book"" seems to focus on Jane, yet there is only one reference to the main character in passing.I think Ms. Banks has the ability to capture her readers with her realistic portrayal of the characters, but her ability to write as novel definitely needs improvement."
3,Good... not great,"I was taken in by the first chapter of this book, and was seemingly deceived into thinking thatit would be a continuous story. It was not. It jumped all over the place, and while I was not confused, I was irritated.She's 15, she's 25, she's 53, she's in her 30's? The wit and humour appealed to me, as I have the same sensibilites, but I cannot honestly say that I will remember this book tomorrow, and compared to the other 3 books I've read this week alone (memoirs of a geisha 4 stars, Jemima J, 3.5 stars, briget Jones, EOR 100000 stars) it ranks very very poorly. It seemed like required summer reading, i did it,now I am ready to move on."
4,Worth a read,"While this book does not live up to the 'hype', it is still worth reading. I found the episodic format very interesting and unique and a welcome change from the typical novel. Jane has a keen sense of observation of those around her throughout the book, although when she really needs that skill, she misses greatly. While I share some other readers' opinion in that I couldn't relate to Jane, I still found it very entertaining and her outlook witty at times. I don't necessarily view it as a bad thing when I can't relate to the characters, as I enjoy reading different and fresh perspectives. This is the third book I've read this year (In the Drink and Fried Calamari being the other two) that I found offered very different and insightful female perspectives. For that reason alone, it is well worth reading. I recommend it."
3,Not exactly a novel,"The front cover calls The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing a ""novel"". However ""fresh"" this collection of short stories is, a novel it isn't. Thinking it was a novel, I was confused when no greater storyline emerged. By the time I read the fifth ""chapter"" I realized that all I could hope for was a series of short stories.Not a bad thing, but don't call it a novel if it isn't one.I enjoyed Melissa Bank's humor, and some of her creations (namely Jane) had depth of character. I LOVED the last story -- it actually elicited an emotional response from me, unlike most of the stories, which turned out to be merely interesting but not engaging. I thought the ending was quite abrupt, though. I thought Bank owed us more than such a sudden ending. After all, we read all her stories and we deserve to know ""what happens next?""Read this book, but just remember it is a collection of short stories, and be emotionally prepared for the fact that they don't tie together in a more meaningful way."
5,A must read for all women and girls!,"I really loved this book. I realized that I was this girl. The main character is very real and helps you realize that you aren't the only person with these problems. I especially like the portion told from a teens point of view, being one my self. It deals with similar situations that are very real and matter. This book is a great one for a girl or woman or any age because it's so realatable!"
3,Needs a good edit,"Such a promising beginning, as witty as a minuet for two chapters, and then it kind of bogs down and gets repetitive. A bit like Terry Pratchet - his first book amazes you and then by number 3 you realise it's the same old formula. But wait there's more. The ending kind of redeems the book. If she'd edited out about a third of the book it would have been a classic, but in the middle she pushes the recycle button for a while and you get deja 'vu 'hey hasn't she aleready said all this'. Good light witty reading but a little dissapointing because of what could have been."
1,Who thinks this is well written??,"I want the whopping two hours of my life I wasted to read this ""book"" back. Jane is poorly developed and lacks soul-- not to mention gives women a bad name.I'm sure they'll make a movie of this...it's the kind of child Hollywood eats up."
3,I Give This Book 2.5 Stars....,"I found no real storyline in this book. It was abouta girl's reaction to the many loves in her life, but I saw no actual story. And the further I got, the more confused I became.It all starts by telling about Janie's brotherHenry's love life, and went downhill from there. Too many wordswere cut off, as in P________ , which I find really annoying.All the different stories pertained to Janie, but they weren'tall told by her.I was counting on a good book about a girl, and the sports, fishing and hunting. Boy was I in for a disappointment.I have to admit there were some good parts, but not enough torate this book higher than a 2.5 from me:)"
2,Disappointed,"After reading several books of this same genre, I was really looking forward to reading a Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing. However to my disappointment I found that I was the one doing the hunting -- for the plot and characters. At the beginning of most chapters I had no idea who the characters were. When she finally gave it away, I had to go back and reread the first few pages to make sure that I was following the story. Then there was one chapter in the middle of the book had absolutely no clear point or correlation with the other characters. Who were those people and why were they there? It was never clear. I think that this book would be better if it was a series of short stories. Each with a begining, a middle, and an end. As for a Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing -I say don't bother. It isn't worth the excursion."
4,"Good, but not that deep","I thought this was a good book, but not that deep. The characters were not completely filled out, but I thought it was a fun read. The author does make you care about Jane, but it is not enough to raise the quality of the book above other books of the same type."
5,I loved it!,"I laughed, I felt pain. I loved this book. It was a quick read - too quick - I missed it when I was done reading. I loved Jane, as a young teenager and as an adult. Bank had me reading at traffic lights, in the elevator, and every chance I got. I highly recommend!"
2,Why all the hype?,"To be honest, I cared so little about this book and its characters that I didn't actually finish it, so maybe something amazingly wonderful happened at the end that I've missed. But I doubt that. Though not badly written, the wandering, boring story is certainly not worth buying. Why praise was heaped on this book, I don't know, but it seems lately, any whiny novel about relationships written by a woman is deemed ""Fabulous"" by the media. There are plenty of good writers, both female and male, but this genre has been exhausted."
2,Ugh.,"The writing itself isn't bad, but ultimately this is just one more so-called ""chick-lit"" book about an otherwise intelligent woman who makes bad decision after bad decision about men until she finally meets the man of her dreams who finds her insecurity adorably quirky. Ick."
2,Series of flat short stories pretending to be a book,"I think I'll have to start ignoring reviews. Many critics raved on about The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing, which turns out to be a slim collection of largely flat short stories pretending to be a book. The main problem with Jane, the heroine, is that she isn't very interesting. This leaves a large hole at the centre of the work, one so large in fact that it devours everything else. We meet her as a sassy teenager and then she moves on from one tedious romance to the next -- and suddenly she is married with kids -- and then we're back to the tedious romances -- and suddenly someone has cancer and we think it's Jane -- and we're back to the romances. It all reads as though someone pressed the ""Random play"" button on an album and we get the various chapters in no particular order. The writing is crisp and there were a couple of occasions where I laughed out loud, yet none of this can compensate for the vacuum at the centre of the story."
4,Makes me glad I'm out of the dating stage!,"What torture young people must go through! Bank is very talented at relaying the heartache, insecurities and bad dates the unmarried must endure while trying to find the perfect mate. The middle chapter referred to in other reviews was also a bit jarring for me, but had value on its own. Overall, it was a fun book to read on a long flight."
3,could've been good but disappointing,"I liked Ms. Bank's crisp writing style and some of it was genuinely funny and truthful, but in the end, I couldn't see any real growth or depth to her character, Jane. Jane merely learns in the end (Spoiler warning) that being herself is better than following ""the Rules"" to land her man - duh, hasn't this theme been recycled a million times already? Hopefully, Ms. Bank's next book will be more focused and won't have a cop out ending like this one."
3,Not what you'd expect,"Interesting but annoying at the same time. The book jumps around and different characters lives are hinted at in various chapters, but it was sort of hard to figure out where Jane was in her life. Is she 12, is she 32? You never knew. I was sort of disappointed but I finished it in a week...I cannot get through Poisonwood Bible in three months."
3,Disappointment,"I found the book to be too loosely thrown together. I felt like the author had a lot of humorous dialogue she wanted to share on the subject of dating and family life, but the vehicle for it is weak. Some of the chapters are unnecessary diversions and only confuse the timeline of events. If you are low on chick books left to read, go ahead and pick up a copy of the book, you will be entertained by the main character's wit. But there is little else to keep you turning the pages. Stick to Bridget Jones."
3,"So, So","I haven't touched a book in month before I found this one, or better yet it found me. I didn't know anything about it and just started to read. I love the way Melissa Banks writes. Short and sweet. It is very easy to read and I had a hard time putting it down. I enjoyed how she jumped from one timeframe to another and it was very easy to follow. The only thing that totally through me off was the story about the neighbors. What was the point of that? After that it went downhill. I kept waiting for those caracters to appear again and until I read some of the other reviews I was certain that the woman with the breastcancer was also Jane. If thats the case, GREAT WRITING, if not, take away another star. I disliked the last chapter the most. Robert was just a little to perfect, such men don't exist."
4,Girl's Guide to Growing Up,"This novel was such an enjoyable read. I read it in one day as the Blizzard of 2000 blanketed my entire area and rendered me snowbound. What a delight it was to be curled up with a book that evoked so many emotions: laughter,adolescent angst, sadness, and the feelings that preside during the ebb and flow of relationships.I felt that the author skillfully captured the normal emotions of a girl as she goes through the stages of her life.Her sarcasm had such perfect timing--and was something to which I could relate since I too use sarcasm to express myself.I did feel that some chapters dragged on and one chapter had no real place in the novel, hence the four star instead of a five star rating.I was sad to say goodbye. It felt that I was leaving behind a part of me. I only hope that I can one day find another book that touched me as much as this one--and if I can't I think I will be forced to write one!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"This book was NOTHING like I expected it to be.When my friend, Carly, handed it to me and told me I should read it, I figured it would be a funny, slightly fluffy novel about relationships (not necessarily a bad thing). It might possibly include a section where the main character is forced to go hunting and/or fishing with a boy (probably one she is trying to impress by being ""outdoorsy.""Instead, I got a funny, touching, well thought-out book of essays following Jane through her relationships. I identified with her in ways that made me laugh and in ways that really made me sad. I wanted to shake sense in her while simultaneously rooting for her.This book surprised me in the best possible way."
4,pretty good read,I really enjoyed this book. It was an easy read and a good story. I like the style of writing here. I'm looking forward to the next book by Banks!
1,Retarded,"This book is badly written. The cover likens it to ""Diary of Brigid Jones"" but it's nowhere in that league. Throughout almost the entire book, the mood and narration is dark, with the headstrong ""heroine"" jumping from one dysfunctional relationship to another, lonely and full of insecurities. This part was fine.But all of a sudden, in the last chapter, she meets Mr. Right, and finds out that--gasp-- she has not been able to find Mr. Right beforehand because of her overreliance on reading self-help books and acting how ""everyone"" told her women should act. NOWHERE beforehand in the book does she even mention a self-help book or playing into some mold of ""only call back after three days"" etc; the ending is a complete cop-out. Even the style of the writing does a 360 in order to try and sell. Most of the book left me unsatisifed or sad, but the last chapter or two just plain annoyed me. This writer just tried way too hard to create a chick-novel."
1,Completely Forgetable,"This book is a bore. It doesn't pull the reader in, connect with you and make you want to keep on reading. It isn't horribly written, it just doesn't spark interest. Ask me in a week what it was about and I guarantee I won't remember.Highly disappointed for all the praise it got!"
4,Wanting more,"I'm not a big reader which surprised me when I realized I couldn't go a day without reading more about Jane's life. I laughed out loud in parts, feeling at times I've done/said/experienced what Jane was going through. Everyone has dealt with some of her angst and worries at one time or another and I feel anyone would be able to connect with the character. The only disappointment I have experienced is going back to Amazon and searching for another Melissa Banks book and finding this was her first. I'll be waiting for the next release!"
4,Very good collection of stories,"Each chapter is like a separate story although ultimately the all tie together at the end of the book. It is about growing up, trying to follow fads and trends, and realising that just being yourself and true to yourself is what really matters.I read it commuting by train and it is perfect for that, although I kept laughing out loud.Very touching at times and made think about my years growing up and the things that shaped me.Very cleverly done and really, really funny."
3,Good writing lacks an arc,"This book is a collection of short stories that lack an arc to tie them together. I guess they are supposed to be tied together because they are mostly about the same woman and her relationships (although there is one story in the middle about one of her neighbors). But the stories are all a little too independent for me, I would have liked to have seen them tied together more. Having said that, the stories do each offer an interesting look at relationsips. Finally, it must be said that every now then the author does turn a marvelous phrase or sentence."
4,beautiful writing,"I resisted reading this book due to the comparisons with Bridget Jones, but I recently bought the paperback and read it in its entirety in one evening. It's important to engage your reader immediately and Bank has a natural ability to do so.Girls' Guide is actually a collection of related short stories; some are told in first person, others in third, but they all surround the life of Jane, the empathetic, self-consious, witty, and sometimes suffering heroine.The writing is clean and simple, yet Bank's words resonate in a way that is reminiscent of Hemingway, Cheever, and her contemporary Loorie Moore. Like Moore, the collection of stories have a central theme and tone (read Self-Help and Birds of America) and each chapter helps us to understand Jane more clearly.Totally engaging, beautiful writing, and excellent plotting. A wonderful first book. Highly recommended."
4,"Ow, ow, ow!","Painfully honest. Funny. And written in a short story style way that allows you to jump from one issue (or person) in Jane's life to another without getting tangled up in ""....and then....and then"". I actually enjoyed her leaps from story to story, and the continuation of certain themes and relationships.The only story that left me scratching my head and wondering about its ranking in Janie's love life is the story of Barney, his lovers, and his family. This story is only loosely tied (and by the very slenderest of threads) to Jane's, and I got the feeling that Melissa Banks just couldn't resist including it, perhaps justifying its inclusion because of the family/sibling/relationship themes. I think it would have been better cut out--it's certainly strong enough to stand on its own somewhere else.And if you want proof that it's a page turner, consider this--I picked it up at 3AM this morning, having read only about 15 pages, and turned the last page at 6AM!"
3,Disappointing book club choice,"Our book club read ""Girls' Guide"" and was generally disappointed. The book starts out pleasantly, but I never connected with the heroine. When she played by ""The Rules"" I just got disgusted with her. If you're looking for a good story about a woman, try ""Where the Heart Is."""
2,"Liked character, didn't like book",I'm not sure I can quickly call to mind another book in which I liked the main character so much but disliked the book itself. Jane was a gem of a gal but I hated what the author did with and to Jane. Pair that with the two weird stories that seemed to have nothing to do with her and I found to book a drudge to read.
3,An easy read,"If you are looking for something light to read - this is it. The main character is amusing and while at times most women will find something in her with which they can relate, the story itself isn't all that interesting. The characters could have been more flushed out and at times the dialogue seemed forced. Fun for a rainy Sunday afternoon though...."
3,Expected More,"At first I thought this book was going to be another incredible tale for woman. In the end I was a bit disappointed. Bank starts off strong. Telling a story that all woman can not only relate to but can say, ""YES! I have been there!."" Although half way through the book she looses it. An interesting book that leaves your imagination to fill in where the author left out."
3,Good Chick Lit.,"My son saw me reading this and broke out in hysterical laughter, saying, ""Mom, you're never going hunting!""Good story but I don't get why the part about the family that lived below Jane at her aunt's condo is included in this book? I thought she would come back to that relation but never does, and it's never explained how it related to the rest of the story. And what happened to Archie? Lots of loose ends, but I particularly liked how she wrote the last section with the two authors speaking to Jane as if they were actually her straight talking girlfriends right in the room with her. Interesting."
3,"Good, but not great","I wish I had realized that GGHF was a collection of short stories. I went into the book thinking it was a novel and came out thoroughly disappointed that what I thought were chapters were really short stories.But, that is besides the point. Once I figured out what was going on, I enjoyed the book, but not to the point I have enjoyed other books I've read this summer.I thought Jane was a great character, and if this had been a novel the much needed (and wanted on my part)characterization of Jane would have been available. I wanted to know more about Jane, and while the stories span her young adult lifetime, I wasn't fulfilled. I didn't feel like I knew her.The final story in the collection, the title story, was a treat. I thought it spoke mounds about the dating game and all those crazy self help books. I loved how Jane's relationship finally worked out once she dumped those crazy rules.Overall, nice easy summer reading. Take a break with this one."
2,A true cut and paste...,"It's ironic that the main character of this novel started her carreer as an editor, for the book was in desperate need of editing. The chapters were very incongruous and confusing--as if she wrote them all seperately and put them together in a random order. I almost felt as if ""Jane"" was a different person in each chapter, and that the collective ""Jane"" represented an every-woman. Looking at it that way, the book was not bad. But assuming Jane was the same person throughout the book...I don't know how this got published really. It was written very much on the surface--I saw the book as a person who is afraid to let anyone see his true self. Unfortuantely in this case, the gilded covering was a little too thin--It was plainly visible that there was nothing below the surface."
3,"Okay, but not great","I just thought this book was average. It had some strengths, especially near the end, but it seemed too often she was bringing up characters that had nothing to do with the story or its lead character (the next door neighbor who was in it for one chapter and then disappeared) or switching how she was writing about the lead character (the chapter where she is referring herself in the past tense and third person). The lack of resolution of any woman in her brothers life also seemed disjointed. It just took away from the general feel of the book. This book is definitely a light read and good for a few chuckles, I would recommend it for a beach read or when you aren't looking for a ""great"" book whose characters will stay with you after you close the cover. I forgot about these characters as soon as I shut the book, but I'm not disappointed I read the book, I just felt some of the hype was out of place."
4,Hysterical hip book for women,This collection of related short stories covers everything female from childhood obsessions to breast cancer to crazy neighbors to meeting Mr. Right. It's a must-read for single women and a should-read for any female over 25. You will laugh and laugh and laugh.
2,Episodic tales of a woman's life and loves.,"Melissa Bank's book, ""The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" starts promisingly. The first chapter is wry and amusing and I thought that I was in for a real treat. The book seemed to be a tongue-in-cheek look at the life of a modern woman. Unfortunately, Bank chooses to jumble up the plot lines and characters in the different chapters of the book. This is confusing and it left me without a coherent feel for what Bank is trying to say. The narrator, Jane Rosenal, is not even present in one chapter, which is narrated by another woman named Nina. The love affairs recounted in the book are, for the most part, uninteresting and without real insight. There are occasional doses of wit and humor that brighten up the book. However, ""The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" doesn't add up to very much."
3,Not bad but I doubt I'll remember it for long...,"Sometimes, I stumble with a book and never get back into it. I did finish this book over the course of a month. A few times a week, I would pick it up before going to bed. Yet, it wasn't one of those books that I would tear through in an evening. My gauge of a good book is to consider if I think the stories and lessons learned will stay with me. I don't think that I'll reflect on the characters or stories much in the future. I kept with the story, but would have rather got it from the library than pay the full hardback price."
2,"so, so","The book seemed gloomy to me. The ""I said,"" ""she said,"" phrases were too common and stood out like sore thumbs. Many of the lines do not flow. The f-word is used a few times."
1,Sorry--I'm not getting it,Just read this after several friends raved. Oh boy--yet another whiny thirtysomething looking for love. What an ORIGINAL concept . . .
4,Captivating,"I really enjoyed reading The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing. The main character was both interesting and amusing. This is a quick, interesting read. I highly recommend it."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read!,This book is all over the place. There are some random chapters in it that have nothing to do with the main character. towards the end of the book its like she goes crazy. I am sad I wasted my money on this book.
5,Single females MUST read!,"The first book in a long time that I have not wanted to put down. Ms. Bank writes a book that could have any 20-40 year olds name listed as the title, because it touches a place in you that you thought no one else knew about. This is also one of the first books I have ever laughed out loud while reading. An easy book to read, but ends up making you think about your complex life. Excellent Book- I can't wait for her next!"
3,something to identify with . . .,"After reading and falling in love with Bridget Jones' Diary, I raced to the book store and picked up The Girls' Guide . . . Jane is someone I can truly identify with: dry sense of humor and looking for love in all the wrong places. Melissa Bank lost one star for the nondescriptives of her characters and their surroundings - I couldn't picture them in my head. The author loses another star for the section about Jane's neighbor and family - neat concept, but it never comes full circle with the protagonist. An easy, enjoyable read but not one that you ""just can't put down."" However, one you must finish to see that you can find real love by tossing ""The Rules"" out the window and just being yourself."
2,Not an exciting read...,"I read this book one rainy afternoon. I was not that impressed with Girl's Guide...The first story of Jane as a 14 year old was enjoyable and I was excited to see what would happen as she grew up. I thought her relationship with the man twice her age was boring. The middle of the book dragged on and I began to lose interest. I enjoyed ""Otherwise Engaged"" and ""Bridget Jones Diary"" more than this and would recommend reading them before picking this up!"
3,"Interestingly weird, or was it weirdly interesting?","I liked it--kinda. I found it to be witty, amusing and smart like all the other ""insecure girl grows into insecure woman"" books out there. However, something about it fell flat. I dont know if it was the fact that the stories were somewhat disjointed or simply that the lead character (i dont remember her name and i just finished it!)didnt have much depth and made some really dumb choices."
3,3 is doing it justice,"I think this book would have been better if it actually was about hunting and fishing.It starts off, Bank is trying to be witty. She jumps around too much. The first chapter gives me a headache. It's boring. The writing in mundane. It reminds me of stories I used to write in high school. The ""he said"" then ""she said"" stuff.She pulls it together a little half way through the book. I enjoyed bits and pieces but the overall story was just lacking something. Each story connected but I felt like she left too much out. I wanted to relate with her but I couldn't. It seemed really wishy washy. The characters weren't very believable. They were cartoons of characters.Overall, it was an easy read. It kept me busy for a few hours but if you really feel like you must read it, borrow it from someone or get it at the library. Don't spend your money."
2,The cover was better than the book,I bought this book because I needed a new book and liked the cover and title. I was disappointed. Maybe I have read too many similar better-written books. Nothing happens in this book and that usually doesn't bother me but the main character was also a bit of a nothing.
2,entertaining novel,"Of course this is to be compared with Bridget Jones, and many have compared it unfavorably. Although this one is obviously a more serious look at a woman's development, I don't find it to be a stronger book, just a different one. It is well written, sometimes a bit too self-consciously witty, but overall a rather realistic portrait of a young woman's lessons in life and love."
2,Tries too hard to be funny!,"The main aspect of this novel that made me dislike it was the humor- it is so forced and contrived! She ends each episode with a ""witty"" remark and it gets old FAST. An abrupt switch of characters in the middle of the book made no sense, and then those characters are never re-visited again, so you might as well skip that chapter. A fast read, and interesting enough to keep you going, if you just feel like reading something. Some good points are made about dating and how women think they should behave, but that's about it....and these are made in the very last chapter."
2,I must have missed something,"I really enjoyed this book - until page 109. For 169 more pages I read in confusion. I just didn't get it. Things switched, they didn't flow, a whole ""chapter"" about a family that is never referred to before or again. I had to log on to see what others said about this book. How did I miss that it was a collection of short stories? For 109 pages things seemed great - I liked the characters, the wit and the writing. But then things changed and I felt blindsided, cheated and utterly disappointed."
3,entertaining and well written...,"After reading the customer reviews for this book I couldn't wait to read ""The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing."" Everyone compared it in one way or another to Bridget Jones' Diary so I figured it would have to be brilliant, and it was to a point. The only similarity between the two is the protagonist in both stories is a single woman...this is where it ends. ""The Girls Guide"" was a page turner and I finished it in no time at all, but it just didn't grab you and throw you headlong into the story (kind of a disappointment, because to me those are the best kind of novels). However, if you are looking for an entertaining book to take to the beach this summer ""The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" is it."
5,Great book!!,"i read this book in 2-3 days and it never takes me that short of a time. i don't normally like short stories either, but this one was different. it was short stories, but with the same heroine all the way through at different points of her life. it was a quick and really interesting read!"
3,A fun read.,"This book may not be a ""guide"" to life, but Jane is an appealing character. It was a fun read. I enjoyed learning about the New York literary scene."
2,This book is a disappointment,"I found the change in narrators confusing in two chapters where they had little or no connection to the main character. I suppose it's because this novel is merely a collection of short stories but then it shouldn't be passed off as a novel. Of the two ""hot"" single, female, 30-something books, I'll take Bridget Jones' Diary any day!"
2,"enough with the lame '90s ""heroines""!","I found this book to be less offensive than Bridget Jones' Diary, but also less consistently entertaining. I truly wish Bank's editor had forced her to make a choice -- is she writing a novel or a bunch of short stories? The uneven narrative voices often made for a confusing, frustrating read. All downhill after the first chapter, which I'll admit I really enjoyed."
4,spunky heroines,"...and we need them spunkier yet. Jane has a liveliness about her but somehow women writers always seem to get bogged down --- or their main characters do --- toward the end. Nothing much is at stake. I wasn't too dissapointed, but like another reviewer I would recommend 'My Date With Satan'and 'A Manual Of Etiquette For Ladies Crossing Canada By Train' which has a nervy heroine on the run on the Canadian transcontinental, handsome detective, etc. almost a spoof. Also 'Alaska Highway Two-Step' a young woman psychic and her dog divining mysteries in the far north."
1,"Jane, have you met Bridget Jones?","Very amusing. A book of such cliches, lower-middle-class value and provincial taste can make it to the bestseller list and actually get good reviews. ""Better than"" Bridget Jones, did you say? Have you BEEN to London? (New York was still mud huts when that great city held the world at bay as THE metropolis.) And if being a copycat was not self-insulting enough, the author and/or editors and/or misguided readers constantly compared this work to the other, much sharper and wittier work by Ms. Helen Fielding. Bridget is not perfect, far from it; but she is devastating funny, and has the ability to laugh at her own silliness. She has all the charms, qualms and sexuality of an urban woman. Jane, however, is nothing but a sagging bag of self-pity. I hope Robert discovers he's gay and leaves her soon."
2,What's all the fuss?,"I bought this book because I kept hearing words like ""funny,"" ""real,"" ""engaging,"" and ""life-affirming"" to describe it. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't find it to be any of the above. I read the first two chapters wondering where the engaging part came in, but soon I had finished the whole book and still hadn't found it. The main character's affair with an older man, battle with cancer, and hardships over the death of her father made me cry more than anything."
1,The Most Boring Book Ever Written,"This book is a collection of unrelated totally unfunny incidents. The main character is Jane Rosenal who is observing life.There is a chapter about her neighbours whom she does not even meet, so why they are there only Ms Banks would know - perhaps to make up the prerequisite number of words?I bought this book as the ""one of the funniest book ever written ..."" etc, but read it without so much as a smile - and I am known for my sense of humour.I found the book hard going, but read to the end on hoping in vain for an improvement. It is beyond my comprehension how this book ever got into print."
2,"Strange, rambling, and adrift","My primary reaction to this book was confusion; it was just strange. It is similar to many other pieces of contemporary fiction, in that it gave a rather spare account of events and followed the actions and emotions of the characters without filling in much detail. I understood the point of the stories, but I just couldn't make myself care about the characters. I found myself getting annoyed with them for making bad choices and acting so detached. The only part I did enjoy was the final story, when Jane tried to follow ""The Rules"" to semi-disasterous results. That made me chuckle because I'm always torn between thinking that ""The Rules"" are ridiculous and wondering if maybe they really do work. Overall, this book just didn't work for me."
5,Very very good and a quick read--highly recomend,"I loved this book so much that I took it with me everywhere until I finished it. I even sat and read it instead of bowling. It was SO good. It actually got me into reading for fun again. I loved the character and I felt like I was her. The language made me feel like I was in the book, it is very captivating and because of that, it is a very very quick read. I would really recomend that you read it. (I'm 17, in case you are looking for a comment by someone around that age or something)"
2,"Commercial venture, not literature","Melissa is bright young woman. She saw the market demand, she had the connections, she wanted some cash. She wrote a contrived, self vaunting portrait of the reflective, funny single NY woman many female readers love to identify with by recycling a few ancient short stories written on dateless Saturday nights and spoofing The Rules. She did it skilfully enough with the intelligent spirit yet inner emptyness of an advertising copywriter and hoped for the best. And hit paydirt. A pleasant enough read - we all eat doughnuts sometimes - but literature?"
2,Lacked a compelling plot....a bit boring at times,"I really had to force myself to finish this book. I thought the lead character was a rich, spolied, narcasist without a sense of humor (unlike Bridget Jones' Diary). I really hated the middle chapter where she introduces new characters and never mentions them again! What's with that? At first I thought the editors just made a mistake - then I realized it was just a gimik - its just stupid if you ask me."
1,A very first book,"I felt that this book felt like something a person might have written early on in their writing career. I didn't think it was well-written or funny, though it had amusing moments (one, at the end) My reading group didn't like it either, so I'm not alone. They gave it so much publicity with posters and ads and everything, you'd think its good but its not at all good. It's flat."
2,Derivative Lorrie Moore,"This book is a Lorrie Moore knock-off, complete with the anagrams and fractured words and narrative point of view. Lorrie Moore is a much better writer and reading this book only reminds you of how good Moore really is."
3,Not sure I understand all the hype!?,"If I could, I'd rank this book 3 1/2 stars, not just 3. This is a good book. Light, true, fun, concise. Some stories were fantastic while others were so-so. I wanted more from this character than boy stories. What is her life like without a man in it? Her style, short brush strokes of information, often left me craving more. The humor seemed ""klever"" rather than ""clever"". (Clever with a 'K') It is certainly a good read, just not as much depth as I had hoped..."
3,Check it out from your library,"i ponied up the $16 to buy this book in hard cover maybe a month or so after it came out...as a collection of short stories it does its job - it's entertaining at times, slow at time, and unpredicatable. although this wasnt the worst book ive ever read ) it wasn't the best and overall i regret buying it.i think my biggest problem was the inconsitancy - three of the five stories were riveting while the remaining were bland (and one did not seem to fit in with the book as a whole) with boring long monologues and descriptionsoverall i suggest checking this out from your local library (for free) and then decide if youd like to purchase it from there"
3,Great with a single exception,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I found the narrator quirky without being odd, dissatisfied without being whiny, and particularly funny. I was distracted by a single chapter that appears out of context in the middle of the book. It is the only chapter that the main character does not appear in and seems to be completely irrelevant to the development of her story, character, ect. It is never tied in to the story, except it appears that the family lives in the same building as the main character's aunt. I kept waiting for closure with these characters, but never got that from the author. I found it distracting to the point that I ended up recommending this book with the caveat that they understand this chapter may be out of context. With this knowledge, I may have been able to enjoy it more."
4,"Good, not wonderful!","I had been wanting to read this book for 6 months and finally got it for Christmas. I liked the book although what it lacked was keeping my attention. I like Bank's style of writing. She has this humor about her writting that you dont find with many authors. That I praise her for. The idea of the storyline is fun, but it lacked excitement."
2,blah...,"My friend recommended this to me telling me it was ' so funny.' I thought the book was more depressing than anything. I kept asking myself when it was going to get funnier, but it never really did. I thought the dating advice chapter started to get funny and hit home a little."
3,"Liked, Not Loved","Maybe it's because I heard such good things about it, but I was expecting a bit more out of this. We read it for book club, and it was just ""A'ight,"" to quote Randy Jackson. ;) It's worth reading, and entertaining, but not life-changing. I think 3 and a half stars is about right..."
2,Really didn't work for me,"The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing started out very well for me. The earlier stories I found to be engaging and had some funny moments (I never had a ""laugh out loud"" moment from this book, but a few smiles here and there). But I really found the book to just drag on and on. Towards the end I was really just skimming the stories and wishing that the book would hurry up and end. I just couldn't identify with Jane, particularly at the end when she memorizes the dating/self help book. She basically turned into a bit of a moron and I found her hard to stomach. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,"great fun, but a little disjointed","The character, Jane, was very likable and clever and especially so in the first chapter while she is a teenager. Such a great start. Then some strange things began. A whole chapter was given to characters who had only been remotely referred to earlier and they were never brought up again. WHY? Then another chapter was written in second person in a very detached way. Was that our main character? It didn't sound like her. In spite of the lack of unity, the book was an easy and rather enjoyable read."
2,What about the two mystery chapters?,"I believe that I may have missed something somewhere, but did anyone else think there were two chapters that didn't fit into the story at all? I wasn't even entertained by these chapters, I was confused. And then I waited throughout the whole book to see where they fit in. I read quite a bit and have never see this tactic before. Other than that blatant literary mistake, I found the book loosely entertaining. If you have nothing else to read it may be worth your time."
1,A sad excuse for a novel,"I purchased this book because the description on the jacket cover was well-written and seemed to point to insightful ideas. As I was reading the book, I had to re-read the jacket cover a few times to make sure I was reading the same book. It lacked character development, depth in story line and the writing was geared towards 13-year-olds. This is probably the worst book I've ever read and I will never read any of Melissa Bank's other works."
1,Can you say confusing?,"The title and the cover of this book really caught my eye. After just finishing the book, I wish it hadn't.This book by Melissa Banks is extremely confusing. I would be reading it one night thinking, ""Yeah, this is a good chapter. I get who this Jane character is."" Then, in the very next chapter, I would have absolutely no idea what was going on. Banks introduces characters without any explanation or warning. The book jumps around from one time period to the next, too.I think this book had potential. Banks wrote some comical chapters, like the one that spoofs the dating book THE RULES. However, this was the very last chapter in the book!My husband would ask me, ""So, how is your book?"" Depending upon which chapter I was reading, my answer varied.My advice is to save your money on this one, or at least wait until it is out in paperback."
3,Not What I Expected,"I'm not sure what I expected of this book, but I had heard such rave reviews that I expected a lot more than I got. This book was okay...but it was broken up in sections to tell the story of Jane's life and love life. And then there was a section thrown in there about another family completely...which kind of confused me. Jane has issues with men. She tries and tries, but can't find happiness and settle down. I guess the moral of the story is to be yourself and you'll find happiness...but it seemed like a long road to travel to figure that out.It was just an okay read. I'm glad I borrowed it instead of buying it."
1,No Bridget Jones,"I was very very disappointed by this book. I thought I would sympathize with a single career women in search of love (someone like myself) but found that Jane's character was unbelievable, unsympathetic, and just plain boring. The writing was uneven and even the style shifted from chapter to chapter that made it hard to appreciate the book. One chapter was written in a high-schoolish 3rd person (She looked at him. He was her lover). Terrible writing at times made me want to throw out the book. The ending was predictable. The only redeeming part of the book was the cleverness of having the two women from ""The Rules"" give Jane advice like the devil/angel scenario."
3,"Good read, interesting, but not all it's cracked up to be.","This book has received a lot of hype lately, so I eagerly bought it. The review I read was only about the last chapter of the book--the part I was most interested in reading. The rest of the book is a little dry, but I get Bank's point that it's important to be true to yourself and who you really are. Since the whole book is about Jane, I didn't see the relevance in the chapter about Nina. Who the heck is Nina? Why do we care? My advice: skip that chapter and read the rest."
4,An enjoyable read,"If you enjoy stories about women searching for their Mr. Right, this book is for you. It is humorous and light reading. There was one chapter in the middle of the book that made no sense and why it was even in there was beyond me. I kept on waiting to see how this chapter would fit into Jane's life, but other than proximity to her aunt's apartment, it had no bearing on her at all. I was expecting the ""Julie"" from this chapter to end up being the same ""Julie"" from the first chapter, but no such luck."
4,Quite Intriguing,"I agree with those who state this is not a book of dramatic prose or unique use of language. It is however, how many of us late twentysomethings and early thirtysomethings are dealing with our imperfect lives - wronged relationships, how to get into a relationship, how to get out of a relationship, career decisions, and lifestyle choices.I found Ms. Banks to be lighthearted and bold enough to express how life's complicated problems are really quite simple. I also agree with another reviewer who commented she did not want the book to end. I think if you can relate to Jane, you get pulled in by her story and follow her loyally to the end.If you would like to read something uplifting, but without the uproariously ridiculous happy ending, read this. This book shows how life doesn't always go as planned and it can still be a good. If you want prose and language, pull out Pride and Prejudice."
2,"Boring, could not relate to Jane","I read this book in our book club. We all found the book boring. Jane was so insecure, confused,and her life had no direction in personnel or professional life. No explannation whay was she like this. I found her character quite irritating. Can anybody explain those two unrelated chapters? Does this represent the young generation today?"
2,Girls Guide lacks direction,"Melissa Bank's book was partialy engaging, but lacked fluidity. The ""Girls Guide"" needed to give readers directions to follow each storyline each time a new chapter began. I found the content to be drab and without laughter. I appreciated what the author was trying to do, but I would rather have actually gone hunting and fishing - than sit through this one again."
2,Disappointed,"I read so many great reviews on this book, and when I finally sat down to read it (it was entertaining) I guess it just didn't live up to my expectations. I felt it was kind of whiney and inconsistent. However, the last chapter was excellent. If she could write a book with more like that final chapter, she would have herself a few more stars from me."
1,Waste of my time!,"I can't believe this book is so popular! It is so boring, and the characters, ungodly boring! I mean that old man she shacks up with? What is that? They couldn't have sex, he was an alcoholic and he was twice her age (yeah, I would stay with him). It never dove in deep on the real issues; intimacy, loss, friendship, loyalty and betrayal. It was too superficial, boring and ridiculous."
3,"Well-written, imaginative, funny, and often melancholy","I read this book after I read its review in The New Yorker, and I just don't get the comparisons to Bridget Jones' Diary -- TGGTH&F is the antithesis of BJD (but I certainly enjoyed both books). The writing is very, very fine, but I agree with those who have suggested that TGGTH&F would have been an even better book if the two story-vignettes which are departures from the stories involving the main character, Jane Rosenal, had been omitted. And I thought that the author sustained the ""Rules"" satire (i.e., the last chapter) very skillfully -- I enjoyed it (and the book) very much."
4,This book will be enjoyed by young girls and women alike.,"The Girls' Guide To Hunting And Fishing is a book that both young girls and women can enjoy and see themselves in. She describes every girls insecurities and need for love and acceptance - not only by others, but from themself as well - with humor and wit. It is a celebration of femininity."
4,"A light, fun read...really enjoyed it.",Sometimes you just need a nice consumable book that you can dive into and come back out a few hours later nothing more than entertained. This book did that. I enjoyed the writing style and the wonderful humor; I liked finding myself laughing out loud more than once. I'm passing this book around...
1,The cover is the best part!,I started reading this book almost by default and it irritated me no end (I never finished it). The author is just trying to sound like J.D. Salinger or any other number of superior New York writers waxing poetic about their adolescent experiences. Her humor is so vague and her vocabulary sounds forced and mannered. I think the reviews are inflated and I'd never read anything else she writes. Nothing like Bridget Jones Diary/Sex and the City. Totally boring.
1,"If it's a short-story collection, why does the blurb on the back cover say otherwise?","If it's a short-story collection, why does the blurb on the back cover say otherwise? The back cover describes the book as such ""The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing maps the progress of Jane Rosenal as she sets out on a personal and spirited expedition through the perilous terrain of sex, love, and relations, and the treacherous waters of the workplace."" NOWHERE is it mentioned that this is supposed to be a collection of short stories, not a novel. WHY NOW? It's not fair to get a reader to like a character and then just end her involvement completely, with no warning! Neither does any of the information on Amazon's site say that this is a collection of short stories. False advertising - I want my money back!"
2,Disappointing!,"I got this book for my birthday. From the title it sounded like an intresting book, but it was not my type of book. It's about this girl named Jane and her love life. She never seems to find the right guy. She gets discouraged and reads a self-help book. She tries out it ideas and finds it is better to be her self. I did not like this book because Jane sleeps around. If you liked this book then good for you, but it wasn't for me. I suggest this book to adults only!"
5,I laughed and cried,"I thought this book was excellent. I was a little confused at first by the jumping back and forth not realizing it was not a novel but short stories. Once I caught on to that I enjoyed it and finished it in a day. It made me laugh out loud, and cry. I loved the character Jane and could relate to so much of what she said. I would definitely recomend this book!"
5,Not like Bridget - better!,"I loved the inclusion of both family and work in this book, as well as other realities of many of our lives. It was fun to be thrown into Jane's story, and to focus on people and their interactions. I was surprised at how drawn to the book I was, once I started it, even though I was bothered by the older man relationship and I would have rather had more of Jane than the 2 ""weird"" chapters. ( I kept waiting for the characters to come up again.) Easy and fast reading, but not fluff."
1,BAD FLUFF,"The author cleverly uses the same character in all stories (although she's not the main character in every story) which I enjoyed; it felt more like a novel than the traditional collection of short stories. Despite the many appearances of Jane, however, she, as the main character, remains dull and flat. Some interesting pages of dialog and nice prose made me want to like this book but the boring characters made for boring stories. And, as a woman, the author should have been able to give the main character some life without making her seem so generic. Too fluffy for my taste."
1,Just Aweful,What a let down! It was worth neither my time nor effort. I'm still shaking my head in disappointment.
2,Much said about nothing.,I sat down for a good summer read and felt nothing but pity for most of the characters. I still cannot figure out where the two chapters not written by jane came from and where they planned to go! I kept reading for a reappearance of the characters and a possible tie in. It never happened and made me go back to the beginning to see if I missed something.
2,skip it!,what a dissapointment! I read the amazon blurb and was hooked so I bought the book... the blurb was the best part! I am shocked at all the rave reviews. Am I reading the same book??
3,Not as great as I was hoping for,"I'd say wait for it to come out in paperback, but at this price... what's the point. I was so exicted about this book I paid full price! I was dissapointed, though, as it took one night to read and i wasn't left as impressed as I hope. The type was blown out of proportion to make up for what little there was to say. It was fluffy and I didn't like the character. It's fine if your bored and the cover's damn cute, but dont' waste your time if you don't have the space to keep it. Overall: Overated."
4,Ignore the bad reviews!,"I just finished reading ""The Girls' Guide..."" and wanted to see what others had to say... I could not believe the bad reviews! I read it in less than 2 days because I couldn't put it down. I can relate to almost every word! I will admit it started out slowly and I honestly didn't care for Jane/Melissa's snooty ways - at first. But then I noticed little clever details and found myself thinking back on what Bank had to say. I won't forget this one for a while. I would give it 4 1/2 stars but that's not an option and 5 is not really accurate given my annoyance with Jane in the first chapter. Still, you should do yourself a favor and read this book!!!"
4,Read it for the writing,"My daughter gave me this book because I was writing a novel at the time. I was feeling cocky about my writing ability until I read Girls Guide. The woman can write. It is a book about nothing and has one chapter that has nothing to do with the rest of the book. However, it may have because the book is about nothing...so who knows? Her style will pull you through the nothingness with a smile on your face. A pleasure to read. The Wonder Place is simply more of the same with some story lines rolled in."
2,not what I expected,"I read this book having seen it metioned along with Bridget Jones's Diary. I guess I was expecting a funny book, and I found this one not funny and rather depressing. The heroine goes through early adulthood attempting to establish relationships and really not faring to well. (the depressing part) The last chapter has her following a ""method"" to manipulate men and almost ruining her chance at what sounds like a good relationship. Now, it was funny. Maybe because I am 35 and married 11 years it did not appeal to me. Just my 2 cents worth."
4,"A Funny, Light Read",I enjoyed this book as one of my beach summer readings. I found the autor to be intelligent and extremely wtty. It is a book all young professional single woman can relate to. I was disappointed at the way Jane's family was unheard from after her fathers death. I loved her pun of the rules!!!! I would love to hear more from Jane and see how her life and lovelife turn out!!!
