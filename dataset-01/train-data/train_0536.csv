5,"Eclectic, magical tunes that will satisfy the soul.","A Belgian band with a Spanish name that plays eclectic songs with powerful lyrics. That is what you get and the result is pure magic. This album picks you up and takes you for an emotional ride with beautiful arrangements that run the gamut from mournful to vengeful. Nothing ordinary here, each cut combines great acoustical harmony with the sultry voice of Dani Klein putting her personal stamp on each tune. Listen to Farewell Song and then decide if you don't want to leave someone! Vaya Con Dios is a refreshing listen for those who want their music mellow but emphatic, creative but understandable and melodies which are tight, crisp and meaningful. This title has SOUL!"
4,Useful for Artists of All Levels,"A useful book for artists of all levels seeking to improve their drawing. I would have liked to have seen more of the problems and solutions presented.Friend covers a variety of subjects and some of the information in this book overlaps her other problem/solution books. Still the concept is excellent. I did not give this book 5 starts becuse more detail as to problems and then solutions could have been presented such as covering a particular subject more in depth, ie presenting 3 or 4 different views of a particular subject.I found the problems presented typically experienced, which was a relief to know that it is common and the solution presented to learn how to solve the problem.This is a nice reference that will be used over and over."
3,"Okay book, but not what I expected","I'm a beginner, so I make alot of mistakes that I'd like to know the solutions to. This book doesn't really give step by step solutions to the mistakes. It just shows the end result of what you CAN draw, but with very little instruction."
3,Doesn't really work for me,"I knew that these are hit or miss. Unfortunately, it did not really work. It is hard to say if it helped or not. When I took Allegra, my allergies did clear up. So if you buy this, it may or may not work."
1,Deceiving,I too bought this book for the biscuit recipe. I live more than a thousand miles away from the restaurant and would have loved to been able to make them at home. I did however find a delicious if not better recipe doing an internet search. Save your money if you were seeking the biscuit recipe...very BAD business decision if you ask me. I won't ever go back to the restaurant.
4,Authentic Southern Cooking,"I looked at each page and checked the ingredients to see if they were the same as what my grandmother and aunts use in their dishes. I must say, ""Without a doubt there are authentic southern dishes in this book!"""
5,Loveless cookbook,Great cookbook. I live outside of Nashville and the Loveless is one of the best local traditions we have. This book is full of terrific recipes for the home cook and intersting little tidbits of information. It is almost as good a eating there!
2,Hoodwinked,"I too bought the Southern Country Cooking from the Loveless Cafe to obtain the Scratch Biscuits recipe, as seen on a T.V. program. Carol Fay did not provide the ingredients but eluded to the fact that to get it, we should buy the cookbook. The description of the book refers to the biscuits but does not contain the recipe. Another lesson learned."
2,Deviled Egg Soup?,"I recently purchased this cookbook and tried the recipe for Deviled Eggs on page 73. How do you stuff an egg with a soupy, runny mess? Obviously this recipe is flawed. I spooned up the mess to taste-test it (or should I say drink it?). It was far too tart and mustardy. Aren't the recipes tested before they're printed? It was the first recipe I tried from this cookbook, but it was such a disaster that all other recipes are suspect for me now. It does contain entertaining pictures and reading material. I just hope that the other recipes aren't as flawed as this one. Also disappointed that the biscuit recipe isn't included."
1,Nothing New,There is really nothing new to be gotten from this book or any improvement to any old recipes. Some of the instructions are confusing and some pictures such as the chess pie refer you to page that has a different recipe than what is pictured. Nothing to be learned here with this book. Very disappointing.
4,Interesting look at the shared history of a group of people,"I'm puzzled by the complaint that this book is not a definitive look at the entire Viet Nam era, when the book specifically says itself that it isn't. What the book IS, as it says on the cover, is a look at the West Point class of 1966, their shared experience at the academy, and the subsequent paths of the members after they left the academy into the turning point of a war which was changing America's perception of itself and the world, and the impact this has had on them since. I read the book several years ago and was quite impressed by it. I came back now to check up on it, because Wesley Clark was one of the graduates discussed in the book."
5,LOVED THIS ONE,"Highly recommend this one wheather or not you are into military history. This book addresses the social problems, structure and everyday problems found in our country today, looking through the eyes of a specialized group. This book should be added to any military collection. The author has done a very good job of reporting. The book is an easy read and quite informative as well as thought provoking. Thank you Mr Atkison."
5,West Point 1966,"This is a true story of the Class of '66 which marched off to Vietnam,fought with honor and came back to a country that did not honor them.A story of five or more cadets and the chaplain, mostly in their own wordsand interviews with the author.A wonderful history of the Academy and the men who went there and learnedduty, honor, country and survived the rigors of their plebe year!Some of them did not like what was going on in Vietnam but noone questionedthe courage of those who chose to go and their fight for the monument to honor those who died.The story brings them to their 25th Reunion and to the cemetery at the Point that claimed so many of their classmates.An inspiring true story. I highly recommend it."
4,Perceptive and accurate,"I graduated from West Point in 1991, some twenty five years after the class chronicled in the book. Atkinson's description of life at the Academy is dead accurate (amazing how few changes twenty five years have delivered) and one assumes that his perceptive reporter's eye extends to the combat scenes in Vietnam. Therefore, for me this book is one of the definitive accounts of the Vietnam era. In that my generation has to rely on second-hand accounts to understand this era, The Long Gray Line is an authoritative guide.Strongly recommended for anyone interested in West Point, the Vietnam War, or the societal upheaval which followed the war's conclusion."
1,West Point for the sensitive type,To much focus on non-warriors for my taste. 90% of the book concentrates on 4 individuals; 3 cadets and a chaplain. Of the 3 cadets only one goes on to a successful military career. If you want to a read a long story of how someone came to be a cadet and the choices they made after they joined the Long Gray Line this might be for you.
1,"To Me, This Was Boring","This book may be of interest to West Point officers who inadvertantly found themselves in Vietnam. But, to me, after all the great marketing hype and superlatives that drew me in, this book was boring. I give it a star for good writing and editing, but, those don't make a book interesting."
5,Why I recommend this book,"Atkinson does his usual in depth reporting of events. In this book he explores the culture of the times, the morals of the cadets and the long term effects of a misdirected war on an entire generation. As a Korean War veteran I could appreciate Atkinson's factual reporting of the events that transpired as the unprepared citizen soldiers entered their first fire fights."
5,Great Stories about the USMA Class of 1966,"The Grey refers to the color of the cadet uniforms and the granite of the buildings at the US Military Academy at West Point.The line refers to the long lasting connection of the core of cadets to the institution and its values. This is what the book is about.Some of the cadet stories still make my blood boil even a year after reading this book. As the one about the US Army officer,a West Point Graduate, who was beaten to death by the North Koreans in the DMZ, in full view of the US Army forces, and nothing was done about it.This book is not merely a documentary, it is filled with real characters of the class of 1966 (could have been my class), some good, some average, and some beyond outstanding.I thought that it was well written with lots of facts and details about the US; the politicians who run it and the persons who serve it."
4,THE LONG GRAY SADNESS,"A stark look at how our military functions, and the heavy toll military engagements take on our guys and girls in the service both physically and mentally. The book stimulates your thinking about the purpose of war, about traditional training as opposed to guerilla training, about the effectiveness of the military, and about the enemies we will never understand completely."
5,The Long Gray Line,"This is a well written book and an excellent portrayal of life at West Point. As a graduate of the Class of 1968, I knew many of the Cadets referred to in this book. I found the portion of the book dealing with life at the Academy to be most enjoyable. It was rather painful to learn of the details of the deaths in Vietnam of members of the Class of 1966 who I had known personally. It is a book well worth reading.Bill Mc Adams"
3,Good theoretical book,The book is very theoretical and it is really hard to use it in applied work. The book is very demanding and hard to read. You have to have very rich mathematical background to understand the book. Not for beginners to start. A very little number of useful examples which clarify to understand the theoretical staff.
5,Top pick,I find myself taken to a different place when listening to this CD. Chris Burton-Jacome's masterful style has quickly made this album one of my top favorites for any occasion. I look foreward to the next outing by this fantastic artist. Bravo.
4,Great Product!,"I can't tell you how much I LOVE this product! It is extremly well put together and works so fast, almost too fast. Everytime I use it I remind myself that I should use it more often. I have had this product for over 2 years and use it mainly for grinding up meat to make homemade ham salad. It took some getting used to using the top. It has a safety lock system built in, if the lid isn't locked into place a certain way, it won't turn on. I found this out after I returned the first one to the store because I thought it was broken. It wasn't broken, I just didn't lock the lid correctly. Since then, I have had no issues at all. It blows my father's out of the water, which he reminds me every time he uses mine. A great purchase for the money, you can't go wrong."
3,NEED MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS AND RECEIPES,"I like this appliance, but I feel the owner's manual did not have enough instructions and NO receipes which I find unusual.I don't know how to use the whipping blade. I wanted to whip egg whites but did not have good results. I would just really like some more help with using this machine."
1,POOR QUALITY,Stopped working after only using a couple of times. Blades do not fit into storage compartment. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!
4,Storage & Recipes?????,"Machine has lots of power and works well but comes with NO recipes for even the foods prepared on the infomercial. Very diasppointing. Also, cord storage is difficult and the front storage compartment seems to hold nothing. Would like to get recipes but Euro-Pros website (WWW.Euro-Pro.com)seems to be non-existant!"
1,Buyer be ware!!,We bought this item thinking it would be a great replacement for our old food processor. We have now had 4 of the blade holder break on us and we have to pay to replace them. We are now in the process of replacing it with a cuisinart.
2,No customer service,After only about a half dozen uses the blade holder cracked and stripped out the spindle while shredding cheese. I have yet to find a find a replacement. I am very unhappy with this company!
1,Should Take Product off of List,Update: I have been trying to reach the company of this product but to no avail. The blades that came with the unit do not fit into the compartment of this product. I feel that the company Euro-Pro has advertized falsely and I will pursue this. I would in no way buy this product! Please be advised.
2,Shipping very slow,"Was not happy at all with service. Ordered it from europro direct. They claimed it was shipped on Dec 11, 2003 after 3 weeks stated that I did not have it yet. They charge 16 dollars to sned a package from california to kentucky and send it the cheapest possible was for about half of what the actual shipping charges are. UPS is less than what we pay for shipping and the track it and get it across the country in 7 days. Hope if i finally receive it it works better than their customer service."
2,Lid Broken - Can't Find Replacement,"The thing works great except for the lid broke and I need a new one. The little plastic piece that holds the prong from the blades fell out. It was cheaply made.I'm going to call the customer service number (800)798-7398 tomorrow and see if they will sell me a new one. I haven't used it that many time and washed it by hand so I don't know why it broke.If they send me a new one I'll update this review and post the number. The website on the owner's manual is useless, by the way, the only products on that thing are vacuums."
5,A force of power yet to be reckoned with!,"I dare any food processor to do what this can do. It's so powerful; for a reasonable price as well. I have done so many things with this. IT has saved me money as well. I have ground beef in this, and less fat as well. I have used this to slice cucumbers. The storage unit is nice for those four blades that you use in the dial . such as the thick slice blade thin slice. etc. You can put the spindle and dough blade in there too. A great feature is the cord storage thing. You don't have to leave it out hanging like you do on alotta things. It's just a wonderful food prep center. Saves alot of time in slicing . blending , grating, etc.. . I would recommend this to all over alot of the other processors."
2,Machine is good - customer service from the website abismal.,"I order this machine from the Euro-Pro website and it arrived with a cracked bowl. I called twice and both times I was told I would receive a replacement in 5 to 7 days. I would also like to mention that I offered to send the broken bowl back so they could see the crack, but was told no. That was in October and I still have not received the replacement. I am at the point that I will purchase a new bowl, but cannot find a source. I would not reccommend that anyone purchase this machine directly from Euro-Pro. I will not order another Euro-Pro product."
5,Loved the cliff hanger,As much as I loved the first season the secon is even better especially the cliffhanger ending that just leaves you begging for the next season.
5,as good as the first,"though i bought this dvd collection for a friend for christmas, as soon as he was done with this i borrowed it. i don't like tv, much, so when a good show comes alone i do my best to support it. this is a great show!"
5,I love this series!!!,"My husband bought me Seasons 3, 4, 5, and 6 for Christmas but couldn't find Seasons 1, 2 and 7. I love this series and am very glad that I was able to find it on amazon."
5,Bones,"This DVD set came on time and in very good shape, and we have not had any problems with any of them."
5,love this show,"this is a awesome show, i loved watching it over & over... its good quality & came in a timely manor!!"
5,Better and Better,"I love this show. Dr. Brennan is lovely and intelligent (though rather obtuse with her social skills). Seely Boothe is witty, charming, and at the same time completely believable as a FBI agent. I must also add that I loveSeely Boothe's black SUV with see-through lights! The computer special effects are amazing. The sets and locations are beautiful.I have both sets 1 and 2 of the DVDs. I hope they have a long run on TV."
4,"Videos, Movies",I own several of the episodes in this season of Bones. As usual they are all fun to watch with a solid storyline & a touch of humor.
1,DVD locks up,This DVD set has a lot of problems. It won't work on one of my DVD players and works sparodically on the other. Constantly locks up and freezes and its unwatchable. Absolute garbage. I am goign to see about returning it.
4,Missing episode and Fox no help,"Let me start by saying that Bones is one of the best shows on TV. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel have the best on screen chemistry in years. And the supporting cast is excellent. Second season really saw a growth of character driven plots and excellent writing. Here's where my problem with the DVD box is. The episode Player Under Pressure #19 which went unaired by FOX out of respect for the Virginia Tech tragedy was not included in this set with no real explaination why. When contacting FOX video, they were unable to give any answers either. This comes from the same company that when the Buffy episode Earshot, that was not broadcast for a similar reason, did later include in in the box set for that season. FOX is also very good about releasing TV shows that include unaired episodes in their DVD box sets, so I am very confused and disappointed by this."
3,"Bones, Second Season","It continues with the same formula as Season One, which got me in from the start. So I enjoyed it and would recommend it to someone who enjoyed the first Season."
5,Bones Second Season-terrific!,Wanted to enjoy the second season DVD set of Bones the second season much more slowly but each episode was terrific so have just about finished - definitely worth having on your shelf. Quality of product is wonderful. You will want all seasons.
4,Fun show,I just like this show. The cast is great and I like the plot.(And I'm glad they added the play all feature that wasn't on season one - I've updated my review to reflect this.)
5,Bones is a classic,"I tried the book series but couldn't get into it-both before the tv Bones began and after watching it-they are so different. The series is a wonderful mix of science, friendship, sexual tension between the two leads and ""who did it""- the murder that is, that I am getting each season til I have them all. Watch the show on FOX and get hooked as I did."
1,disappointing,"We quit watching half way through the boxed set due to boredom, irritatingly inconsistent story lines, lame character interactions, and never-ending rabbits pulled out of hats. Big, big disappointment after the good potential of season 1. The only high point, and it was a very high point, was the terrific Stephen Frye as Booth's FBI psychiatrist."
1,Bad Business,I ordered this item around the 1st of November and the money was taken out of my checking account. I have been waiting and waiting for it to arrive. On December 8th I got a notification from Amazon that they were crediting my account and this item was not coming. No explanation on why this seller held on to my money since the first of November or why this item was suddenly not coming. Had I known - I could have gotten it on the day after Thanksgiving at a lower price but since I had already ordered it I was just waiting for it to come.This was a bad experience. I had to give one star just to be able to write a review.
1,No order,"I never received my order. I am in the process of trying to get a refund or, if at some point they would like to send my order, which was Bones, The second season, that would be great too. I emailed KIDSINAMERICA, the company my order is from, twice and they never responded. Thank you."
4,Great forensic mysteries lightened by humour,Bones mixes great forensic mysteries with humour which sets it apart from many of the detective shows currently on. Bones and Booth's chemistry is great and Emily Deschanel plays Bones' somewhat skewed personality well.
5,great crime and comedy,"""Bones"" really finds its heart and momentum following a cliffhanger ending in the Season 1. The relationship between Bones and David Boreanaz keeps building up leaving the audience wanting more and hoping that they will get together. The second season is a great follow-up and is a great series to get hooked on for anyone that enjoys a good mystery."
3,Bones Season 2,"It is a great season to watch, however while watching disc 2, the disc tends to skip around from different sceens and it would start all over from the begining. Be careful of the people that you purchase from. You never know when you might get a bad disc when they say its in great condition."
5,We love Bones,"We've been with Bones from the beginning and enjoy the bizarre characters and events, mostly because the dialog and acting excel."
2,decent stories...terrible dialogue,If you can get past the irritaing dialogue and silly romance between two of the shows minor characters it's ok.....thats hard to do because the writers seemed more drawn to the very irritating interpersonal relationships of the secondary characters during season two. I liked season one but was very disappointed in season 2.
4,works reasonably well,"In the last few years, I have developed a sensitivity to consuming even one or two glasses of beer or wine such that I have headaches and lethargy for half the next day. Naturally I was curious (but skeptical) to try chaser. I am happy to report that it works quite well for me. The difference is quite noticeable and I am headache free the next morning (this is after 3 times using it). I recommend it. The major drawback for me is the the pills are reasonably large and I have a hard time swallowing them. However, I have found that chewing them is tolerable."
5,excellent product,i am a 29 y/o male that has never reviewed anything in my life. i highly suggest this product if you have a problem with headaches of stomach aches after a night of drinking. this truely works and lives up to the advertisement.
5,It works,"I was very much a nonbeliever in Chaser until I tried it. I followed the instructions and it worked. So, now I have a new drinking buddy Chaser."
4,Cute,"I got this for my girlfriend and she liked it. It's very cute. I chose it over the other pigs because it's a bit floppy and cuddly.It comes with an application to name a star after someone, which is bogus. These star naming registries are recognized by nobody except the registries themselves. Buy this because it's a cute pig, not because of the star gimmick.http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/buying_star_names/"
5,Favorite book ever,"""The Little Fellow"" is a wonderful children's book about a foal who learns humility and compassion. It was my favorite book as a child and still is today. The illustrations and story are beautiful."
5,best dog toy ever,I have 3 labs who absolutely love this ball. They carry it everywhere and even sleep with it. And they don't destroy it like all their other toys. The only problem is they are impossible to find. I bought 5 from Amazon so I could stock up. Great product but very rare!
5,Almost essential for learning about the Dust Bowl and the Depression,"A well produced television special on the Dust Bowl. Though somewhat incomplete in its depiction of the Dust Bowl, Surviving the Dust Bowl gives a very good over view of that drastic event in U.S. history. It works very well as a tool to give modern students a perspective on 1930s American history and its implications to present day. While it does seem to lack in-depth analysis, I don't think that should dissuade people, as there is only so much a producer can do in a 50 minute television program. The really good thing about it is the inclusion of people who were there and witnessed it. It goes well with The Worst Hard Time by Timothy Egan."
5,My mom's recalls,"My mom remembered so many incidents like that when she and my father experienced the ""dirty thirties"". It was a joy to have her share them with me after she read the book."
4,The American Experience of The Dust Bowl!,"I bought this DVD because I am doing the Dust Bowl for a college paper. While I found the DVD documentary to be first rate, I felt that it could have been longer in the DVD than on the PBS special. I find the Dust Bowl years to be a fascinating part of the American experience in the plains.The DVD special introduces us to Dust Bowl survivors who remained in the Plains while hundreds of thousands left for the West in pursuit of the American dream. This documentary only touches the surface of the Dust Bowl in it's history and the effects are overwelming obvious in the pain of the survivors who were mostly children.The Dust Bowl survivors are basically children who lived through the experience but they explain their experiences with pain, pictures, and unforgettable memories.If you want to know about the Dust Bowl, this will be a good overview of the subject but not much else."
5,A great book on the year of Iyawo,"En esta obra de Cabrera, ella hay escrito en cual explica los taboos que el neofote endura durante su ano de iwayo. Translation: In this text, Cabrera has written a book that explains the taboos that the newly initiated into the religion of the lucumis must follow during their first year. Cabrera's book also gives explanations on shell divinaiton as well as some history on the religion. This is a great book!"
4,ghostly and delicious,"Six chilling tales loaded with atmosphere and edgy story-telling. The title tale is a fine piece of work, but two others, ""Dearest Clarissa"" and ""The Spider,"" are even better; the first is a masterpiece of subtle tension between what the first-person narrator knows and what the reader slowly figures out; the latter is not to be read by people who are afraid of spiders! The collection finishes with a sort of ""dessert,"" a macabre but amusing tale of bodily resurrection and revenge. Highly recommended for those who like ghost and horror tales."
4,quite interesting book,Easy to read book. My daughter is an artist so she likes reading the history of art. The book was in great shape and shipping was ok.
1,ruff,"When i asked my dog if he liked this... he said ""GRRUFF RUFF GrruUURRFFF"" then used his nose to push it off the balcony and whined. So i'm not sure if he liked it or not... When i chewed on it.. it felt really nice on my teeth, good possibility I will order a smaller one for me."
1,Dangerous Product For Pets,"Flexible Dental Chew - Wolf (5.5"")The Flexible Dental Chew ""Wolf"" bone is very disappointing. I have a small 10-month old pomeranian/poodle mix (12 lbs.) puppy and he chewed that ""Wolf"" bone rapidly and swallowed many small blue pieces. I threw it out and would like other pet owners to realize this is a fairly dangerous chewable toy. However, on the other hand, the dental dinosaursDental Dinosaur Durableare amazingly terrific. He is working away on the dinosaur and I do not have any worries at all about his swallowing pieces constantly as he did with the ""Flexible Dental Chew Wolf"" bone."
2,Didn't last long...,I have a 6 month old labrador who was able to break large chunks off of this bone in mere minutes. I had to take it away from him because I was afraid he would swallow a chunk.
4,Dog's Favorite Chew Toy,"My fox terrier loves these. They are hard synthetic (rubberized plastic of some sort), and she's a strong chewer. They last about two weeks, until she has gnawed down the two ends. The raised bumps across the surface make it ideal for good oral health, and as they break off over use, the pieces are pea-size, so easily passed through the digestive system if swallowed (and certainly not sharp). I started my dog with these as a puppy, and two years later they are still her favorite toy. More importantly, she always channeled her chewing onto these, and never got into destructive chewing activity. They're also lightweight and easy to throw for indoor or outdoor retrieval fun. My 17lb dog likes the Wolf size. You can find these in stores, but the better buy is here on-line (I save about $2 a piece). My 4 out of 5 would be a 5 if these lasted a little longer, but I know to stock up."
5,My Yorkie Loves!,"Review from 10 yr old Yorkshire Terrier (15 pounds)..... ABSOLUTE FAVORITE TOY! Constantly chews. Smaller size was suggested by chart, but Wolf has taken the cake with proper size selection. I rarely see my yorkie without the dental chew. Constant!!!! I have had to shop several stores to locate locally. Now the price is like HALF here. So Amazon to the rescue."
1,Disappointed and concerned...,My 14 lb. bichon threw up a pile of blue chunks this evening after getting this bone for Christmas. I didn't expect this from a Nylabone and am very concerned.
5,got a 960 3.0? BUY THIS!,"Installed on my '92 Volvo 960 3.0. Deep mature sound, great fit. Several times cheaper than the original spare! This is a gem!"
1,Not direct fit,"This hose was advertised as a direct fit for my RX-7. Although length and diameter are about the same from the stock hose, this one is not bent the same way and causes a kink in the hose. This kink prevents the coolant from flowing like stock, starving the engine resulting in excess temperatures. I should have spent ten more dollars and went to the dealer."
5,The Best CD!,"First of all this CD is not for people that live in United States because they will never Understand. If you ever listened to any of Ayla quiet songs and other 120 BMP rythms you will definetly like this CD. This band is very new and not very vell known. They were first known in the Italian MTV and later in German MTV and VIVA. THe hit ""Se Tu Vuoi"" was very successful in summer of 2000 in most of Europe. Is is associated with RAP which sometimes makes interesting and boring, but generally is great HOUSE music. There are other versions of the song, without the RAP."
4,Very Good but...,"there are chapters that torture to read through. Let me first say that the Cisco Network Academy text books have been excellent. The advanced routing material is never going to be easy to learn. This Cisco books cover more of the needed material than some of the competing books for the BSCN exam.My only complaint is that some of it could be made easier to read. If you are not already knowledgable on OSPF and BGP, you will find that you must push through page after page of details of analysis of protocol packets and states before the author puts it into context. If you learn well that way, more power to you. For me, I needed to go to other sources, such as Cisco web site or other text books, to find material that also set up example configurations, so I could visualize and digest the tremendous amount of detail required to understand these protocols.That said, you still won't go wrong with this book."
2,Wanna Know All About It???,"Philip Carlo was a guest with the Kukulinski widow and his two daughters on Larry King Live. Their interviews, greatly fascinating, sent me to buy a copy. The book came (400+) pages, and I started to read. NEVER,NEVER have I read such an detailed, blow-by-blow account of many brutal murders that one young man created in this detailed biography. True crime is intensely interesting when the reader unfolds the schemes of the criminal and his cunning maneuverings. But ""Mr. Polack"" was so incredibly horrible that I really didn't want to read the entire book then stay awake for several months bathing this completely out of my system. Yes, it is very compelling. The writing is excellent, and the story moves quite fast. By at page 95 I stopped, and quit. So off it goes to another person who wants to ""know all about it""."
5,Ice Man Goes to School.,I bought this book because I'm doing a case study in my Criminalistics II class. I needed a book source for my paper. This book is awesome. It gives details of Richard's crimes and his family life. Because of this book I have little to no use for internet sources.
3,"Fascinating, but Unbelievable","Richard Kuklinski is indeed a fascinating person--fascinating and repellent in sickeningly equal measure.He's also more full of hot air than a squadron of balloons.It goes without saying that a lot of Kuklinski's claims--that he helped murder Jimmy Hoffa, for instance--are not only unbelievable, but laughable.Richard Carlo tells this story very well, but sadly, he seems to swallow all of Kuklinski's outrageous (and discredited) claims wholesale.We may not be able to trust the subject of this book, but we should be able to trust the narrator to separate the wheat from the chaff and judge the veracity of his subjects' claims.This is a very gripping read--but it's also a work of biography, of HISTORY. Carlo forgets that his duty is to ascertain the truth, not simply to tell a gripping and sensational story. Ultimately, he shortchanges the reader--even as he pushes the reader into his seat and makes him read the story all the way through."
4,Crazy Good Litterally,"Only complaint about the book was how the author repeated himself numerous time it became very frustrating. But this is an amazing story, that seems like it should be a work of fiction but it is non-fiction."
3,"Interesting story, terrible writing","If I was rating this book on the author Philip Carlo's writing ability alone I would give it 1 and a half stars. The repetition, the cliches, the poor sentence structure were enough to stop me reading any other book. Luckily for Carlo he has a compelling character to write about and this alone has saved him.The extend of truth in Kuklinski's story isn't really verified but if it is true, he certainly is a unique and fascinating character and I think worth reading about. If you are into true crime Kuklinski's story is a must but maybe the tv shows will be a better source of material (though I've only seen one of them)."
2,Becomes increasingly less believable as you read it,This book is a little schizophrenic as it can't decide if it wants to portray richard as a horrible monster or as a dexter-esque bad guy killing other bad guys. some parts of it seem pretty credible but some parts are completely implausible. not a bad read if you're stuck on an airplane or something.
2,Very little Credibility,"I bought ""The Ice Man"" because I had viewed the HBO documentary, which was truly chilling. I read this book once and gave it away. According to Richard Kuklinski, hardly a major killing took place in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s without his involvement. Among his incredible assertions are that he participated in the murders of Carmine Galante, Paul Castellano, and even Jimmy Hoffa. Had he been somewhat older, it wouldn't have surprised me had he stated that it was he, and not John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated President Lincoln. Since it's been some time since I've read this tome, my recollection of many of his allegations are somewhat hazy, but I do remember questioning many of them. Philip Carlo's writing is flawless and gripping, and although there's no doubt in my mind that Kuklinski was a ""stone-cold killer,"" his credibility, in my opinion, is somewhat debatable."
2,"Interesting story, Disappointing writing","Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer is an interesting story. Here is a man with almost zero sense of right and wrong. Or, at least, a very skewed sense. The story really brings you in on how such a killer is created. The author, however, seems to be fascinated with Kuklinski physical features. His height and cheekbones are mentioned constantly throughout the book. Also, seemingly to accentuate a dramatic passage, the author uses sentences that are 4-5 words that go on for pages and pages. If you like true crime, you'll like this book. Just don't expect much in the writing."
1,Sucks,This book is so badly written I couldn't even finish reading it! It is about 10x longer than it actually has to be. The writing is redundant and awful.
4,Great Read,"This book, however disturbing, is a great read. The real life characters read more like a fiction novel then actual people that may be living next door to us. I honestly enjoyed this book."
2,BS Meter on High,"An entertaining if poorly written book. There are plenty of reviews explaining how there's no way this guy could have murdered half the people he claimed and I agree with them. Show us the cave with the rats. He went there so many times there would have been a trail carved out to the cave (doesn't take much). As for the writing, how many times can you say, ""recently so and so said..."" Answer: A lot! There's also plenty of repetition. This could have been 20% shorter with ease."
5,The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Killer,"Mr. Carlo is an excellent writer. The book never slows down and keeps you reading. There is no doubt that ""Big Rich"" killed a lot of people, however you can't help being a tad skeptical of the continuing body count throughout the book. The biggest example of this is the claim that Richard Kuklinski was responsible for the murder and disposal of Jimmy Hoffa. Regardless, the book keeps your eyes glued to the pages and goes far beyond the HBO series of Kuklinski's interviews. His ""creative"" ways to kill are appalling, yet fascinating, and Philip Carlo did well describing them to the reader. This book is a must have in a True Crime collection."
5,This book will SLAY you...,"The writing is excellent and very matter-of-factly. It lets you decide for yourself exactly what happened to this man and is a SERIOUSLY factual in-depth look at the mind of a psychopath. If you're even remotely curious about this kind of subject, then I highly recommend this book to read. And you will think twice before flipping someone the bird, I tell ya that!What I liked best about the book was the way that it was written in a respectful manner and still very tastefully done considering the gory topics and ways he killed. FASCINATING. I bought it based on the other reviews I read here alone, and I am glad I did! Thanks, guys!"
2,Poorly written,"The author is frustratingly repetitive and uses so many clichés. Though I did like learning about Richard, the author seems very limited in his ability to understand the psychopath without resorting to phrases that sound like cheap narration."
4,ICE COLD HIT !!!,"This book is a must read for anyone who wonders what makes killers tick. In the book, Ice Man, you get a look at what made this icey, cold professional, number one and why so many people feared him. The book goes way beyond all the same old info that has been previously written on Mr. Kuklinski's exploits with the mob and of course the famous killer spray that he used. I couldn't put this book down, it was that good! But, I would have liked to have read what life was like for him in prison? Did anyone have to be dealt with his special talents? All in all, the book is worth every penny and you won't read the same old story of fancy gangsters and fast cars. Ice Man gives you guns, knives, rats, bats, bullets, and bombs! This book is definitely a book that one must own, and place in your personal library."
1,Pure Poop,"Shame on you,Phillip,for writing that Kuklinski had anything to do with Hoffas;Galantes;or Castellanos murders.Kuklinski may have said he participated in these hits;but you of all people should have known that this was B.S.These ridiculous claims made a lie of your whole book.After reading these claims,who knows what is fact or fiction.Too bad;it could have been a really interesting book."
4,good read!,"Well first off it is a great book and worth the read it will keep you entertained right till the end. But even before i read the book i knew a lot about kuklinski and this book seems to lie quite a bit and time frames are pretty off. if you know nothing about the man then this book would be even better but unfortunately i found myself saying ""thats a lie"" and ""thats wrong"" while reading. the author really has his facts screwed up either that or kuklinski isn't keeping his story's straight. with that said its still one of if not the best mafia related books I've read. it goes into great detail about dozens of different ways kuklinski murdered his victims from poisons to crossbows to pulling off someones nuts with his bare hands LoL so if your into that kind of crazy stuff this is the book for you."
2,Lies,"Being someone who is blood related i can tell you there are more then a few things wrong with this book. Not just stories about what he did, but also fabrications of his family, for one his ""uncle"" was givin the wrong name. His ""uncle"" is my grandfather. While its nice not seeing my familys name inprint, its also a lie to the public. One thing they did get right is that you would have never known he was a hitman. He always said he was in ""buisness"" haha. believe it or not he was quite a nice man"
2,4.5 stars? Seriously?,"I don't understand how The Ice Man is rated so high. I gave up reading this book about two thirds of the way through, and it was a struggle getting that far. These ""confessions"" are so embellished you can't really distinguish fact from fiction."
3,its okay,"This book is a good long read but some of the story was very far fetched, I would recommed it."
4,Philip Carlo was a great crime writer,"Philip Carlo was a great writer of true crime. In almost every instance Carlo gets to know the subject of his work personally and it shines through in his writting, Kuklinsky is no exception. In fact, some time after I read Ice Man, I ended up seeing an interview of the man himself on TV, and I'll tell you, he moved and sounded exactly as I would have expected having read Carlo's book.[...]J.R. Locke, Author of Possible Twenty, a Gangster Tale."
5,Fascinating!,"This is a fascinating story of the life of Richard Kuklinski from before his birth right on through to his death. The author has a ""stay out of the way"" writing style, and it is Kuklinski's story that is front and center. The author enterviewed Kuklinski extensively for the making of this book, so you feel as if you are hearing this directly from ""The Iceman""."
4,"Good Read, but lots of holes","I interesting, fun book to read for any mafia buff or those interested in the subject. Many of the claims by Richard Klusinski seem pretty incredible or far fetched. The writer says all are substantiated and researched his claims to verify. Still, Rats eating alive more than one victum he put in that cave? Even the clothes eaten in one instance he claims? Richard lived his life as a lie, so some info is suspect to me. Regardless, its worth the read if this is a subject that interests you.A friend of oursDavid Gambino"
4,should be mandatory,"Newly bound, arrived rapidly and securely...inside, a vacation for your eyes, mind, and soul...one which timelessly continues to remain relevant while wandering around along with this well respected author. Buy it, and enjoy."
3,Gary&#65533;s Choice,"Buy and enjoy the whole thing (Ring of Bone) instead. Lew Welch may have been less certain about this and that, most of his life, than this selection or refinement suggests. When a writer disappears suddenly, the entire remaining mess is often interesting. Selections reveal much about their editors, of course."
2,A little disappointing,"The first two books in the trilogy series were fast-paced and fun. Unfortunately, this wasn't really the case with the final book (Lionboy: The Truth). The story seemed to just drag on and then at the end everything happened at once. It seemed that only parts of the book were good while the rest was slow, irrelevant and unnecessary. However, I would still recommend that you read the book so you know what happens at the end of the trilogy series."
5,Bought them for Myself,Liked these books so much that I bought them for myself even though my kids are too old for them. the originality is great!
1,Ham Radio,"It would be an easy jibe to say the actor Billy Bob Thornton's album was a vanity project. He's keen to establish his cred - he played in Southern boogie bands as a teenager, including a ZZ Top tribute outfit called Tres Hombres - and his album Private Radio (Lost Highway) certainly sounds good. That's due to producer Marty Stuart and the band of brothers he's hired (including keyboardist Barry Beckett). The great title fits the concept - his personal musical journey - but that's the problem. His songs are Southern gothic cliches, and as a singer he's a ham. He's trying so hard to be a tough, but twisted hombre. In `Forever' a trucker calls his gal to declare his commitment - while wearing her pink panties. And his ode `Angelina' should have stayed behind closed doors: ""They said we'd never make it / Two crazy panthers on the prowl / They said we would only fake it for a while / But we just looked at them and growled."" To be quickly filed beside William Shatner's album."
4,Surprisingly brilliant,"I bought this because i liked him, not because i liked country music. At first i was unsure and yet soon grew to love it because of its honesty and style. Its very different to anything ive heard before eg the nine minute monologue and yet you can't help but get drawn in to what he is saying. His voice is so relaxing to listen to and the range of songs gives it such depth. With not being a country music fan, i couldn't say whether it's good in that sense.But i do know that this man seems to get more talented by the minute, and this album certainly reflects not only his talent but also gives an insight in the mysterious and yet fun person that he is."
1,Worst piece of crap ever!,Not even worth getting into - heard this at a friends and we all had a good laugh at how pitiful it sounded!
4,"Finally, some real country!","It figures I would like this! Every one else hates it! I'm a big fan of a ""Boy Named Sue"" and Three Ciggies In An Ashtray>"" Feels like someone finally put out some country the likes of Whiskeytown and Hank Williams Sr. Dark, slow, and taking the piss out of 'imself.Thanks Billy Bob."
3,the review of a lifetime,"Well this book was quite interesting, but in my opinion it could of had more facts about each and every butterfly."
5,John Gary oldies and goodies,The double album of songs sung by John Gary provides great music at a good price. I enjoyed hearing favorites as well as songs I hadn't heard him sing before.
5,Soild Braid from Wellington,Outstanding !!! I got my spool of line on time. Great packing and the correct diameter. I really happy with my purchase. I saved a lot of money buying it off of Amazon.com . The local hardware store charge a bit under $4.00 per 48 foot roll. I got 600 foot for under under $30.00 bucks shipped.
1,A frustrating novel,"BEFORE AND AFTER, Rosellen Brown's previous novel, is a gripping and frightening portrayal of family ties. HALF A HEART also deals with issues of the binds of blood and genealogy, but it is so frustrating in its obviousness and its bleak view of the perceptions of contemporary society on race (from policemen to wealthy Texans to its central character, a young black girl) that the novel is almost unreadable. Brown just doesn't tackle issues of race, economics, religion or education with any sort of poise. Her characters develop into horrific cliches, even as the novel, in its portrayal of a southern Jewish woman who had to abandon her black baby, at least on the surface, seems to transcend such banality. A long awaited novel that is a complete and utter disappointment. I concur with a previous reviewer who suggests Sue Miller's WHILE I WAS GONE instead, a novel that has its own problems (plot being one of them), but has an emotional weight that bears at least an ounce of truth."
2,"topical, yes, groundbreaking, no","I didn't really understand why this white lady would abandon her child in the first place -- and for that matter, why the mixed-race Ronee, who had been raised in a black community, would be all that interested in white boys. The whole story seemed kind of didactic, and didn't resonate with me. The characters were there to represent a particular position, rather than real, complex people."
3,good but not excellent,"This book is done in layers, with a multitude of topics to peel away and discover. Mother/daughter relationships, racial issues, [ bi/racial attitudes, southern segregation,black/white relationships ] teen-age sensitivities, family harmony, and plain old prejudices are all involved. The characters are a bit hard to see as ""real"" but the plot moves along in a moderate mode of predictibility. However, there are several important ""messages"" to be gleaned from this book and it does bear reading and concintration!"
1,"A long-winded, predictable novel","This novel tries to be ""dramatic"" with its theme of a white mother and her half-black daughter, but the author takes so long to make anything happen that the reader loses patience early on. Also, the characters aren't very appealing, especially Miriam with her endless brooding. The writing is competent but nothing special. Some of Brown's earlier books were much better."
1,A major disappointment,"Ms. Brown is a more-than-competent writer and the premise of this novel is intriguing, but it disappoints on nearly every level; the storyline is tedious and the characters self-absorbed, annoying, and ultimately predictable. Most unforgivably, nearly every character or situation in the book disintegrates into stereotype. By the time I reached the chapter dealing with Ronnee's false arrest and incarceration, the circumstances felt so contrived I lost every bit of sympathy or interest. Why, after such a potentially groundbreaking premise, did Ms. Brown resort to stock scenes and cliches? The story, and her readers, deserved better than this."
5,Decide for Yourself,"Hard to believe I read the same book these reviewers are trashing. It's far more complex and sympathetic on all sides, not sentimental but challenging (maybe that's the problem)and unwilling to accept easy stereotypes. Ronnee is no ""tragic mulatto"" -- she may be confused but she's much too dignified for that. And her father is no big black brute. So what's going on here? Protecting the turf,to keep white writers from poaching on territory that isn't ""theirs""? I guess readers will have to decide for themselves but they should read ""Half a Heart"" and make up their own minds."
1,wow,"This item purchase was a total disregard for advertising, as many ofThe products are, on here. The cable to meet was to be 6-15 ft and it was three inches long. It did not, I repatriation DID NOT state that in the advertising for this product. If something isn't what it is, don't say it is. All ur dvds and dvd players that claim to be 'region free' aren't . Soo I'd definitely look into accurate advertising, maybe a new employee or something. Change it!"
2,Very educational but not very fun....,This toy has the look and feel of a real laptop. It is purely educational and not very fun at all. It claims to have 120 games but there are several of the same games which are seen 4 or 5 times each but in different catergories. Ours was purchased for our kindergarten son on his sixth birthday so most of the activities are much too advanced for him. His eight year old friend picked it up and became bored and put it down within 5 minutes.
2,Not for gigging,"Tweaky pedal, overall. That means that nothing stock sounds very good until you tweak it. It might be OK for home and studio work, but don't ever use it live. It takes too long to electronically switch between patches. Results in ""dead air"", so to speak."
4,La manera verdadera de rebajar,He leido varios libros de dietas majicas. Finanlmente encuentro un libro sincero en cuanto a dietas se refiere. El libro explica porque las dietas no funcionan. Uno tiene que tener un cambio de actitud. Leer las experiencias de Maria Antonieta fue beneficioso. Recomiendo este libro a cualquiera que este cansado de dietas majicas.
1,ES EL PEOR LIBRO QUE HE LEIDO EN MI VIDA,"SU CONTENIDO ES MUY POBRE. NO TIENE NADA DE EXTRAORDINARIO. MUY MALA CALIDAD TANTO EDITORIAL COMO DE IMPRESION. ES UNA BASURA DE LIBRO. HASTA PENA DA PONERLO EN VENTA, PORQUE ES UN INSULTO A LA INTELIGENCIA DE UN BUEN LECTOR. OJALA ME DEVOLVIERAN MI DINERO."
4,"Great design , Great Price","I am not a big garden person, but this is great low effort, low cost weeder. You'll want to be careful with the extra leverage this gives, or you pull out a good-size clump of dirt with the roots.I am now the dandelion death machine!"
5,Norman Rockwell's Patriotic Times,This is just an awsome book. I had one I was going to put up for sale and changed my mind after looking through it. Right now at this time it is just a refresher of how many different generations have given all for us to be free.Thanks to all the Vets. and everyone else who has ever sacrificed for the rest of us.
2,Look for something else,"This book is already too old. I mean, it needs update. If you are new to anatomy, look for something else."
2,missing colours,"There is no place, in our days, for an Anatomy book without colours. The contents are good, but the models in gray color are not interesting. It is difficult to be memorized, even though they are well done. It does not come with a CD."
5,Polyurethane 7-1712-BL Black Big Block Radiator Isolator,"Polyurethane 7-1712-BL Black Big Block Radiator IsolatorI just happen to stumble across these on Amazon. My stock rubber isolators on my 69 C20 have seen better days, plus they have been replaced before. Cracked, dry rotted, oil soaked over the years they needed replaced.I just installed these and am tickled, with the fit and finish of these. My radiator now sits level again and has the correct spacing between the radiator support and the radiator it self.For a small investment and such a big return, I'm sure you will be happy with these as well.Buy with confidence.RagenRat"
5,Radiator Blocks,"Used on our modified race car to mount/cushion our radiator. Did exactly what we needed. Could see how it would work as advertised to mount specific radiators. For us, it was just what we needed."
2,I don't get it?,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she loves Dora. We opened it up, punched out all of the cards, and looked for the directions for the game. Well... there is no game. I have no idea what the point is of the game, so we had to make something up in order to use it. Needless to say, we've only played it once and my daughter hasn't asked for it again. Maybe we can play go fish with it next time."
4,A Beautiful CD,"This is a beautiful CD. I don't understand why it was not released in the United States. As in her other recordings, Neneh covers a lot of genres in this one. ""Woman"" is a great song. I swear I heard a version in Spanish on the radio in Seoul the other day."
4,Built to last,"The first track from Neneh Cherry's third album begins with a dark, haunting string that leads into a satisfying trip-hop rhythm. Immediately it becomes apparent that the brilliance of Cherry's past recordings like ""Manchild"" and ""7 Seconds"" were no fluke. There's something for everyone here - R&B, rock, hip-hop, Jazz, acoustic guitar, trip-hop, dance - and yet it all seems cohesive thanks to the increasing strength and clarity of Cherry's distinctive vocals. While MAN is not as brash and original as Raw Like Sushi or as heartfelt and satisfying as Homebrew, it is a record that is definitely worth owning."
4,A forgotten artist,"Most only know Cherry from Buffalo Stance, but her second album Homebrew was a fantastic album. I had no idea that this album had been released, but am very glad I finally found it. Another great collection."
2,Not one of hers that I enjoyed,"I like the artist here and the tunes that get you up to dance...this is not the offering for that. It reaches some, which is great, but not all albums are going to score."
2,One song to enjoy,"It took me forever to track this cd down and after listening to it, and I really tried to like it after all of the trouble, I couldn't force myself to like it. The only track that I like is the one from ""Long Kiss Goodnight.""Neneh is applying a more alternative sound to this cd. I like ""alternative"" music, it's just rock music, but I don't think this is all that listener friendly. Just my opinion."
2,Beautiful Book Cover,"Though you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, I purchased this book because I loved the title and the cover.The story was a long, sweet, and slooow romantic tale of Maya and Mykal. Before the love is unveiled, the deep pain and its scars must be revealed so that healing may begin. Perhaps there is no easy way to tell such a poignant story, so the author takes readers through an emotionally draining tale of soul searchers, soul robbers, and soul mates. The story is very important because there are women who need spiritual and emotional healing, but I was not touched by the way it was told. Finally, love prevails and finds its way into the hearts of two loving couples who have longed for true love but were too afraid to reach out and grasp it.I pray for supernatural healing for women who bear the emotional and physical wounds that Maya carried. In Jesus' Name. Amen."
2,Whats Up With All This?,"I Love The Show So I Have No Problem With The Show But Even In The First Season It Says ""The Complete First Season"" and Then On The Back Of The Case It Says ""Some Episodes May Be Edited From There Network Broadcasting"" So They Gave Us Cut Episodes!! And They Still Are!! We Pay All This Money For Are TV Shows When They Finally Come Out And They Give Us Edited Copys From TV Re-Runs!! They Should All Say ""The Complete *** Season"" And All Actually Be ThereOther Than That I Love Sabrina!!"
4,The rise of Christianity,"This was a very interesting and original analysis on the rise of Christianity. The thesis of the book is that Christianity didn't need mass conversion or Constantine to make it into a major religion...that was occuring on it's own (an analysis that offends most antagonists of Christianity).From the Christian response to sickness (taking care of the sick as Jesus commanded...instead of abandoning the sick like the pagans), the christian response to abortion (prohibiting the procedure and thus having a much higher birth rate instead of the pagans that forced it on their wives even though the practice regularly killed both mother and child).In these ways (and others) Stark documents clearly how Christianity was a superior to Paganism and how Christians and their friends lived longer, happier lives and had more children as a result through conversion and natural increase grew exponentially."
1,Selling Mormonism Through the Back Door,"I picked-up this book by chance in the book store as there is not a great deal written for non-academics on the subject of the early Church.An hour into reading the book, I found I'd been had.Beginning on page 7, we start to hear out of left field the muffled drumbeat ""for"" Mormonism by the author. This is disingenous at best, and intellectually dishonest at worst.If the author wants people to pay him so he can advertise for Mormonism, while he's allegedly presenting a reasoned and researched view on early Church development, say so up front.A peek into the Index will reveal about a dozen references to Mormonism, a few for Judaism, even fewer for Islam, and ZERO for Protestant or Catholic traditions.A quick googling of the author showed he's presented as a Mormon cult ""apologist"" and professional expert witness in courts cases. Need I say more?I'm returing this book tomorrow for a refund."
1,Elitist Nonsense,"Mr. Stark continually references his earlier works, and his collaborative works to suggest answers.The constant use of Italics give this work the appearance of propaganda.""New religious movements draw their converts from the ranks of the religiously inactive and discontented""...Stark is part of a new religious movement (the Cult of Liberalism), but he fails to notice. A little self-reflection would suit Mr. Stark."
4,I Different Look at the People of the Early Christian Church,This book is very useful in understanding early Christians and who they persuaded in their day. Christians today should be delighted to read this book. Early Christians really were different from those around them.
2,"gee wiz, Mr. Science","This book contains interesting speculations about the early history of Christianity, but I was put off by its pendantic use of a positivistic brand of sociological theory. Too often, the book uses generalizations from research among Mormons and other modern religious movements to arrive at conclusions about early Christianity, with inadequate regard to the cultural particularities of the ancient world. The author seems to think there are law-like regularities governing the behavior of religious movements that cut across time and cultures; if a proposition holds true in 20th Century America, then it must apply equally well to the societies of the Roman Empire. I find this approach unconvincing, at best. If I were an ancient historian, I'd be offended by the author's insinuation that he is bringing the insights of enlightened social ""science"" to a stodgy and unprogressive field of scholarship."
1,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this book because I saw it referenced a handful of times in other books that I really enjoyed. So, I finally purchased the book and began reading it but was very disappointed. Mr. Stark uses ""sociological analysis"", which means poor statistics, a confusion between cause and effect that shows is misunderstanding of the issue, and neglects large amounts of Evangelical or Catholic scholarship. This book rings of academic arrogance and is not very useful to understand Christianity nor the rise of it. Very disappointed."
3,Cuspy,"There were a couple of chapters in this book that I found absolutely fascinating. The rest was hard to get through. A scientist or sociologist would probably enjoy this scholarly work. For an average person like me, there were too many statistics and overlong discussions of esoteric theories or probabilities. I bought the book because I read a couple of interesting excerpts. Reminded me of going to a movie only to discover the one or two good scenes were included in the trailer...and the rest was dreadfully dull."
1,Poor Piece of Electronics,This electronic calendar did not last more than 8-10 months. There was no brand name or way to contact the manufacturer for help.
3,confusing package,"Just got this product sold from AmericaRX. The first impression is the package is not the same as shown in their ad. Instead of a big box it comes as two separate small boxes with tube inside. What's more, the label on the box says ""Anti-aging Pycnogenol Eye Gel Ideal for Sensitive Skin"", no words about Green Tea Extract on the front, and I couldn't find the exact package on DermaE's website, which really annoys me. Anyway I will start using it to see whether it works or not."
1,It is so terrible,"Firstly,there should be two in the package. I only received one.Secondly, there is little unknown gel in the bottle so I think it was expired."
5,Journey with Aloha,"Mahalo to Curby Ho'ikeamaka Rule for sharing his experiences and wisdom in this enlightening book. If you are interested in language, history, spirituality, physics, mythology, chanting, philosophy or breathing, you will find it all here within a Hawai'ian context. Really! ""Explorations"" at the end of chapters help make the concepts more real and personal for the reader. I found it to be an exciting tool for the journey of life... so pono.Excellent appendix work in the areas of Hawai'ian language, glossary, elements, hidden meaning, and mythological figures."
4,Good read,Fabulous pictures. And always an interesting adventure. Inspires me to want to plan every free moment visiting the great places they are lucky enough to photograph
4,"Lots of ads, but good for the price","As one of the cheaper ""home living"" magazine subscriptions, I expected a lot of ads. Was pleased to find that there were also lots of nice photos inbetween."
1,have not received it,"I have not received it yet, still waiting, I wanted to check out the digital copy but need the code from the print copy. It has been weeks"
5,Nice magazine,"I enjoy this magazine for the pictures mainly. I like the variety of the beach cabin look and seeing the places on the water. It's not as useful as Handyman, but I do like looking through it for ideas."
5,great mag,Magazine has lots of good articles and great pictures. A perfect magazine for generating your own indoor/outdoor ideas even away from the coast.
5,great magazine,"Whenever I read this magazine, it makes me think of vacation! I am relaxed and inspired and develop a desire to remodel, renovate & go visit whatever I read about! Great job, Coastal Living staff"
1,Coastal Living Magazine subscription,"My subscription was purchased on May 28, 2012. I have not yet received the first issue, which is very disappointing."
2,Not impressed whatsoever,"Subscribed to this magazine and after receiving many issues, I'm not the least bit impressed. It's a very slim magazine with very little in it."
5,magazine gift,I ordered this as gift; this is one they wanted and it was delivered as scheduled. I think people need to take this in consideration when they order magazines for gifts; it doesn't ship immediately.
2,Going Downhill Fast,"I have been a subscriber to Coastal Living for about a year now and I have to say the quality of the magazine has really gone downhill. I got the magazine because it's eye candy. I wanted to see beautiful beach houses and learn about exotic destinations. Now, it's a knock-off of Southern Living and Better Homes and Garden. They seem to have a new editor (maybe the 3rd one this year) and even the layout has changed. They keep featuring these tacky cottages and reporting on the most boring things (200 things to do with salmon, diners in Florida). I will not be renewing my subscription and will try my luck with another magazine."
5,Life is a Beach,"If you love beach living or dreaming of beach living, this is the magazine for you.My husband and I both love it. It is helpful for ideas in general and for choosing out of the way getaways as well. enjoy."
3,Haven't received yet,I ordered this on Sept 13. Today is Oct 14. Have not received the first issue yet. I will submit a review after the first issue arrives
2,Only white people on the coast?,"I had heard good things about this magazine and so ordered a sample. It is a lovely magazine, beautiful photos and it is interesting reading about ""other coasts"" (besides east and west). But, at least with the most recent issue, in every article about families or couples and their coastal homes the people were all caucasian. Even the advertisements had only white people (save for one about vacationing in Mexico that had some cute Mexican children in it). While I doubt this is intentional, I would encourage the publishers of this magazine to put their attention on this issue. There are plenty of people of color living on the coast who have interesting homes and lives that readers would enjoy learning about."
3,not bad,the watch looks exactly like the preview picture in amazonbut the problem is it gets dirty so fast
5,Product was in excellent condition,We used this video for the 5th graders at the school. It came very promptly and was in excellent shape and has saved our school the expense of buying it new. Very fair when it came to pricing.
1,How much is cheese worth?,"Wow! This album is even worse than I thought it would be. The only reason I bought it was for the horribly cheesey song ""Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On"". I should have just spent $0.99 on iTunes. Oh well, you live, you learn."
4,"came on time, shape was ok","it arrived much earlier than i thought. only problem was its pretty extensively written in for the first three lessons. im getting around it, but it makes doing he workbook difficult."
1,Hola Amigos! Workbook/Laboratory Manual,Did not deliver what was advertised. It is a Workbook so I expected some filling in the blank but this book was advertised as hardly used. Wrong. Over 25% of pages were completed. If you are buying this for a class check the edition. A textbook used at university level is probably using most current update. The book I bought was not the most current.
1,Bogus!,"I downloaded a couple of cuts from this CD and they are NOT the original artists, just bad imitations."
3,Different but good,I was a little shocked not to hear Ken Tamplin but this is still a pretty darn good CD. They found a vocalist that is a great replacement for Tamplin.
5,"Affordable, Exact Fit Replacement Part","My Marineland 'H.O.T. Magnum' canister filter began making noise and working intermittently. (No complaints, since I've had it in near constant service for over ten years.)After disassembling it, I discovered that the small bearing at the magnet end of the impeller shaft had detached.Found this replacement part here, after flinching at the forty dollar price my local pet store wants for the same item. Purchased it here for less than half of that amount, including shipping.It's an exact fit (although my original impeller was orange, not blue), and my trusty aquarium filter is once again silent, and working like new.Good ol' Amazon.com to the rescue again !"
3,Intresting work,"Perhaps though this band would be better off in the realm of producing ""concept albums"".With their definitive approach to sound and mood it would be better for them to think of record making as something other to getting laid or selling t-shirts.The group is reaching something they will never find in trying to use formulas established by other well known bands.This is not a bad band or even a bad album,but it leaves you wondering what else they could of done had they invested more time in believieng the means justifies the end."
5,WOW - Loved it! Set aside time for this book!,"There is so much happening in this story you won't want to put it down. Mike witnesses a murder across cyberspace and the murderer sees him. Mike goes on the run thinking he can find safety but soon finds himself being hunted by the law as a suspect in another murder. All the while he's being hunted down by the murderer. Pretty soon Mike is heading across the world as he tries to find out what is behind the murder he witnessed. The murderer is just steps behind every move Mike makes, and he is catching up fast! Great cast of characters.Great read! Highly recommend."
2,Realistic view of life in the early days of the west,Ms McGowan is apt at describing the torturous and terror filled scenes that took place during the seige of the stagecoach outpost and she is successful at capturing the sense of difficulty and uncertainty that came with living during this period of time in the west. That she also has succeeded in bringing the characters to life is a plus to the reader and it lends credibility to the story. McGowan is a talented and versatile writer and it's a pleasure reading her books.
5,Bialetti Stovetop Espresso Maker,"I was first introduced to the Bialetti Stovetop Espresso Maker at a weekend reunion. A friend who shares an appreciation for a quality cup of coffee brought one with him knowing that we wouldn't have an espresso machine nearby. We fired it up on the stove, poured it off,and enjoyed an excellent cup of coffee. After I got back home, I purchased one for myself. The first brew on the new Bialetti was while camping on the coast. It worked great on the Coleman stove. I love my home espresso machine but the Bialetti is hard to beat, at home or away, when it comes to convenience and a quality cup of coffee. Great for brewing at work as well.Deren RossAuburn,Ca"
5,Tamrac case,Tamrac makes great cases for cameras and camera accessories. The 5205 case is perfect for my Canon SD770is. I have used Tamrac cases for other cameras in the past and recommended to friends who have also been completely satisfied.
4,compact,It is very durable and compact. Could have been just a little bit bigger to store extra battery and memory card.
5,Lost Knowledge Uncovered,"Most of the things that Dr. Bates talks about are completely lost on today's average opthamologist (or my doctor anyway). It is good to get some research from another source, and not feel so dependant on the current methods, which seem to require that my vision keep getting worse, until I get some disease that requires surgery, and all at a great cost to me. While sufficiently technical and specific regarding questions of the eye's construction and abnormalities due to strain, Dr. Bates' book is most clearly written and I have recommended it to a few friends."
4,An informative and quite useful book,"Unlike one reviewer on this site, I found this book to be a delightful read, and especially appropriate for teenage Jewish readers. This is not heavy reading, rather this is bedtime reading that is both informative (""Did you know so-and-so was Jewish?"") and on occasion thought-provoking. Far from being anti-Jewish, as has been implied, I found the book to provoke pride in one's Judaism. And the lighter touches (about the Jewish origins of the inventors of Superman, for example) are much appreciated."
4,GREAT LIST ON A GREAT PEOPLE...,"Well, objectively speaking, I must say I think Jesus had quite a greater impact on history than Moses, but we won't quibble: they're both awesome figures by anyone's measure. I recommend this book to all Jews & Gentiles who need to think through the tremendous contributions of the Hebrew race to all areas of human civilization. I can easily conclude, after going through this remarkable list, that some ""special blessing"" rests upon the children of Israel. May their tribe increase forever.Len Hummel (a Gentile Judeo-Christian)"
1,A Book that is Not About Jews,"From the title of the book you think the book is about Jews, however the author puts the Jews he is referencing to down, or he compares them to Jesus. I thought I was getting a book on great Jews. For example the author would talk about Moses, then make comments about Jesus totally for no reason unless he is a ""Jew for Jesus"". I really do not understand the author's motive, but I learned that you can not judge a book by its cover."
3,Dream Warriors,it6 was a so so movie. it wasn't what i exp. i wouldn't ask other people to buy this movie.
1,Stay away!,"I like post-apocalyptic theme in computer games and movies, I really do. I dig b-graded stuff that many people call ""horrid"" and ""not watchable"" - if it deals with survival of human race after the whole world has been set on fire it usually is enough for me to be able to enjoy.. But I made a big mistake the day I purchased this dvd without reading any review. Must be a Mad Max clone, I thought. I was wrong, oh how I was wrong. There are no costumes, no barbaric weapons, no barren landscapes.. Script, actors' performance, director work - just plain horrible. Please read reviews below - and do not repeat the mistake I did when purchasing this piece of *beep*. My copy of this dvd goes straight to the trash can."
1,Stay light years away from this movie,"You're kidding right? This can't be real, I mean this movie can't actually exist because that means someone spent the money and time to create it and why would anyone do that? If only MST3K were still on the air, they would have had a field day with this fetid lump of manure.It's a post-apocalyptic world where some people are born with special powers. The new world leader, Parrish, played by a somnambulant Lance Henriksen obviously daydreaming of the days when he could get real acting work, is trying to wipe them out so the race stays pure. There's some other bullcrap about a baby being born to fulfill a prophecy, but by the time that happens you'll already be bored stupid."
3,"Good movie,but a bit too much","Dream Warrior which is known to be called ""A man called rage.""Should been able to come up with a better storyline where the main hero,Rage(Played by Daniel ""Dar"" Goddard,The star from BeastMaster.)tries to save mankind from the evil demonic father of his that wants to kill every human on the face of the earth.However,There has been an understanding about the movie and they should try harder than that."
5,Thoroughly Entertaining!!,"Excellent movie!! This is a great conflict-driven story about the battle between 2 races after the end of civilization as we know it. Daniel Goddard (who was so great in the Beastmaster t.v. series) is perfectly cast as Rage. There is a lot of action, as well as a great ending (I won't give it away). If you like the movies on the Sci-fi channel, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie!"
5,Unique,"I ordered this for my wife, for our (copper) anniversary. The actual piece has a deeper copper color, and less black than the photo depicts. The merchandise arrived promptly, leaving me pleased with both the seller and the product. My wife was happy with it, which means that I am as well.You've probably heard (accurately) that copper might turn your neck (or finger, or whatever) green. If this is the case, apply some clear nail polish to the pendant. You will probably have to swap out the copper necklace for something else, like leather. I realized this before the purchase."
3,remade dvd,the quality was good until the last 10 minutes of the film where it breaks up; you can not see the ending of the movie. evidently when the dvd was recorded from the vhs format there were no quality checks
5,"Red Skelton, Gotta Love Him!","For years I've been a Red Skelton fan, and anything I've ever seen him in has been hilarious. His style of humor is so missed in our world today, especially in the movies that our out now. We need more of this goofy silliness & clean fun.This movie is extremely family friendly & I know kids of all ages will get a good laugh at it! My kids loved this when they were younger & still do today!"
2,Moisturizing Gel,Puchased this because the website stated rhat it was good for oily skin but it didn't help and it made my skin feel sticky.
3,I like their other products more,I buy a lot of the derma e products and this one is not top on my list. It goes on wonderfully but soon your skin feels dry again. I wouldn't call it a wonderful moisturizer
2,Did not moisturize,"The product did not perform according to the listed Vitamin C, E and A; no difference in skin appearance nor feel."
1,Not good,"Product feels cool upon application, yet there is a lingering and annoying stickiness. I could overlook this if I thought Derma e's Pycnogenol Gel was an excellent product, even mediocre, but no. The bottom line is this, there must be more research done into Pycnogenol before you claim it was the next natural beauty revival product. Maybe it was just my experience but this ingredient did my skin no favors, I ended up with discolorations, dead and dull looking skin. Kinda how the tree probably looks that this ingredient was extracted from. I am a man so I kinda liked the idea of using tree bark extract to make my skin look better but it just doesn't work out well. Please scrap this whole product line Derma e. Everything else is excellent though."
1,ping pong tv video game,"Save your self and do not buy.......I bought this for my son for Christmas. He has asked for a ping pong table. I thought I was being clever. Not enough action for a typical 11 year old. He showed me how slow the game was,...wow it was truly a flahback to technology of the 80'swhy would anyone want to recapture that era when we are so much more advanced on the tech of today. Buy a video game in this era.........."
4,Pub Table,"Yes this is nice but it could of come with better instructions for assembly, looks great in our home now."
1,"frustrated student and parent, awful book","This book is written horribly. Perhaps someone who already knows and understands history thoroughly might recognize certain events as written in this hideous textbook. 15 year old students might be able to regurgitate some of the facts scattered about but will likely be confused and find absolutely no continuity to events in history.How on earth did this awful book get adopted by California as the AP World history text? Did the reviewers even read it to see how events are explained.This book is a total turn off. Text is poor. I would give it an F minus. Comparisons are made but very unclear as to what is being conveyed. Pointless,ridiculous, in fact shameful that this book is the only option for high school students, or anyone for that matter. Shame, shame, shame!Frustrated!"
1,Very Displeased,WE ARE 5 WEEKS INTO THE SCHOOL YEAR AND WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT!!! VERY DISPLEASED!!!
4,Primary Source for Understanding the Indians of the PNW,"Given the size of the topic, it is amazing how well Ruby and Brown provide an encyclopedia on the various Indian nations of the PNW. Their extensive publishing on the Indians of the PNW speaks to their knowledge and the quality of their writing is good.This is the book to start with when seeking knowledge on the Indians of the Pacific Northwest."
3,book,Item received in timely manner but the cover and a few pages had a big knife slash right through the middle of the whole book.
3,Mostly kind of dull,The stories in this book are neither exciting nor boring. They simply aren't titillating (friends tell me the first volume was much the same thing). The writing is certainly competent enough but the stories don't do much for the libido.
1,The best place for this book is in the trash bin,"I have read Joey Hill, Sylvia Day, Jaci Burton and Lacey Alexander books, which I enjoyed. I am hard pressed to find even one story in this collection that was worth my time to read. I decided to buy this book because I thought it would have tales from all over the world for the ""armchair traveler."" Well, it does, BUT I did not expect to find such revolting tales as the one where ""Ceylonese sisters-in-law find[ing] themselves hopelessly drawn to each other in a culture that will never accept them."" The ones set in TIbet, Havana, etc. are possibly even worse. Do not waste your money on this book. And I certainly would not even bother to consider the book that preceded this one!"
1,Careful when buying this one - Most sellers send other vesion of this title.,"As a Front 242 collector I would like to warn you about this item that is been offered by some marketplace sellers. Please be aware of the fact that if you decide to purchase this item what you should get is an Import enhanced CD single that contains not only three audio tracks (Headhunter v1.0, Welcome to Paradise v1.0 and Headhunter v2.0) but also a video track for the song Headhunter. I've purchased this item based on the picture and on the comments from the seller and ended up getting another version of this title, the one that has no video track. The enhanced CD single is rare, the other one is quite popular. Just a heads-up so you don't waste your money or have to go through a claim process. Beware of the sellers that are overpricing this title taking advantage of the picture that is shown."
4,great product,"I bought this about a month ago, and by now, I can fairly say this is the best dvd burner out there! It is so simple to burn from vhs, that I was able to burn all my very old home movies without any problem... The 2 inch screen is extremely helpful, since this way you know when to stop it... It is very easy to setup the dvd on diff. quality modes, so if my vhs was very old and the quality wasn?t that good, then I was able to burn about 6 hours on one dvd with the same quality as the old one...Another plus nobody seems to have mentioned, I can burn directly from my tv! I am going on a long car trip, so I burned for my kids 6 hours of disney channel programming so that they could watch cartoons they hadn?t seen before!Why didn?t I give 5 stars? Well because the only thing missing is a way to create menus, titles, etc. from movies burned without the computer, maybe, if before finalizing I could do something with it in my computer, then I would give it 10 stars!!"
3,Does NOT play back the DVDs!,"Got one of these and played with it for a while. As others reviewers said, it does a good job of burning DVDs from various sources.But do not be surprised to find out that it does NOT play back any of those DVDs! I was. It doesn't say anywhere in the description that it does, so no misrepresentation on Sony's part - but I think a lot of people - obviously I was one of them - might not imagine that a DVD unit for $250 will not actually play DVDs - well, this DOES NOT. After you record those DVDs from your TV, for example, you will have to put them in a different player to play them back.Also, as with previous generations of Sony recorders, I have had the unit think that a tape I was dubbing was finished, whereas it was just at a scene cut. Unattended dubbing therefore presents the risk that the tape might not get dubbed in its entirety."
4,"It works, but is quirky","It works well in its primary role of making the nightmarish job of transfering VCR to DVD fairly easy. But, typically Sony, the interface is quirky--takes a little getting used to and it's very easy to push to wrong button.It is most important that you use a good VCR with it, with the features and commands that you need. A crummy VCR can easily push this back into the nightmare realm. Not the VRD-MC1's fault, but there it is."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I was looking to be able to transfer all my kids' videos to dvd and this machine cannot do it. I hooked up our vcr to the unit but because the tapes are protected, the unit will not record.I did have success transferring over all my home videos to dvd and for that, it does a good job."
1,Don't buy this product if you're recording from a DVR,"I was excited o receive the DirectDVD for Christmas, so that I can burn some programs from my DVR and clear up some space on it. The first time I used it, the DirectDVD worked perfectly. Then, I tried to record a second program and I kept receiving a ""waiting for input signal"" message.The manual says that if you can see the program in the preview window on the DVD system, then it will record, but that's not the case. As soon as I pressed record, the signal would go away, and I would receive the same message.I was using the same DVDs and the same DVR, tuned to the same channel, so there's no reason why it shouldn't have worked. I wasted three DVDs trying to get the system to work, since you have to format the DVD before recording; tried turning the system on and off, and nothing worked.I am guessing it will work fine for camcorders, but like I said in the title, don't get this product if you plan on using it with a DVR. I'm returning mine."
1,No Stand Alone RAW recording,I bought this for a trip to record my photo's from a Nikon D200. I shoot RAW and JPEG format concurrently. Upon returning from my trip I Disconvered that the MC1 only records JPEG files as a stand alone. It will record RAW files if processed through a PC. I contacted Sony to see if there is a Firmware update that will allow me to record RAW files as a stand alone. Sony responded that they are developing a follow-on unit that will have this capability and there will is no planned update for the MC1 to record RAW files as a stand alone.
5,This is as easy as it gets.,"I bought this to transfer some video from a Hi8 video camera, it can't get any easier. I have a Sony camera which plugs in (4pin mini) to the recorder hit a button and transfer that's it. I also had some pictures on an XD card all from the same event and added them to the recording. One touch to close the DVD disc and it's done. Images and video played back with very high resolution. All of this without a connection to a PC no software nothing. If you go hook it to a pc the included software loads perfect. This is a great device."
3,16;9 format,"The other reviews do a nice job of describing recorder. BUT, what is not said is that it does not support the 16:9 format. This is out of step with Sony's new camcorders. Sony agent said they do not support 16:9 and no of no plans in the works to do so."
4,Sony VRD-MC1 DVD Drive,Had to contact Sony to get drive recognition but after getting this the drive worked fine.
4,Love this!,"I loved this legal documentary and gave two copies away to friends in law. I gotta admit it sat on my shelf a bit before I watched it. The title ""Bananas"" isn't intriguing.But the movie itself is well done. Packaging and distribution is by Oscilloscope which is my favorite. Each of their releases feels like you are watching one of the best films in a film fest. Very good all around."
2,"Good book, but it's almost a decade old","Bruni and Burkett have written a thoughtful, probing book about the sexual abuse of children at the hands of clergy. It's too bad there is very little detail about the revelations and discoveries over the last six months because everything has changed. They address it in a new introduction and afterword, but it feels like a clip job."
1,Zero stars,"If you're looking for a great example of vile anti-Catholic bigotry this is certainly the book for you. The two authors are simply the latest in a long line of haters of the Catholic Church who suspect anything and everything about the Church of Christ and are more than willing to smear their bile all over the written page.They actually use as one of their sources Denis Diderot's despicable fictional work ""La Religieuse"" which even at the time (late 1700's) was known as a ""practical joke"".But somehow these two authors have taken it as a serious work worthy of being used as an historical source. Diderot, who labeled himself the ""enemy of God"", was one of the writers whose works laid the basis for the bloody anti-Church French Revolution, and one wonders what writers like Bruni and Burkett are up to in foisting this unhistorical piece of fictional garbage on an unsuspecting public.The shame is on them."
4,Remembering my Mississippi,"This book brought back to memory many of the prejudices I had seen as a child, but had forgotten or repressed as an adult. It's an accurate view of life here in The South during this time period."
4,ups and downs,"Well, I am a hardcore musician, so I do have some critisizm....The writing on this album is very creative, as are the rhythms, chords, etc. This band is very cool, and really fun to listen to. It has grown on me a lot (luckily).My only problem is that the guitarists are really messy, and even sometimes rhythmically uneven. If they had clearer guitars, maybe with some more delay on, then this album would shine like no other.The music in this album is hard to describe, only one term comes to mind: A.D.D. They have many transitions, and they can be random at times, but it all works well somehow. This does have some emo qualities to it.Overall, this band is unique, has there own music to speak, and I encourage buying this album."
4,Heart Warming,It is interesting the natives had figured out back in the 1700's how to care for the land and a lot of us are just figuring it out now. It is very moving to understand some of the old native teachings. Very heart warming.
4,Great Live Blues from one of Blues best dou's,"Live from 1974 Montreaux jazz festival Buddy Guy and Junior Wells play with Pine Top Penkins and Bill Wyman. Sound quality is excellent, set selection is a nice combination of slow and fast tunes and Buddy and Junior do a nice job sharing the lime light. Buddy does a nice job of tone it down for Junior while still providing plenty of heat. Great rap with the crowd as well. If you get a chance to see Buddy live, please make the effort to see one of the last great blues men. This is a great CD for people who love live blues."
5,Definitely Smokin'!,"This album captures two of the best blues masters at their best in the mid-seventies. Blues was not on the radar during those years, but Buddy Guy and Junior Wells show how the blues was kept alive to an appreciative audience in Europe. (They even mention how they are not appreciated at home!)Since it was a live recording, the mix was not quite as balanced as I would have liked, since Terry Taylor and Pinetop Perkins play some tasty guitar and piano, respectively. But overall, the band cooks through an all-too-short set! A must-have, if for no other reason that it is a great representation of great blues in the mid-seventies."
5,TNT 'N DYNAMITE !!!!!,"Best electric Buddy and Jr. cd I own! They really COOK on this one and the back-up band is TIGHT! The crowd is very responsive to the vibes and continuously spur the performance to greater heights as the set proceeds to its climax of Sonny Boy's ""My Younger Days."" Recording quality is excellent and the mix is top-notch. It's hard to believe this was a LIVE show! If you own just one non-acoustic cd from the Dynamic Duo, THIS IS IT!!! 'Nuf said!"
5,These guys aren't kidding around.,"This is some serious blues people. Real American homegrown. Listen to ""When you see tears""..Buddy Guy has lived this, and it pours out in this song...""I can't sleep at night because I'm nervous""....its so potent, its so honest, not some wanked out British imitation...not for casual listeners or kids..."
5,Future Plans,"This album is indeed a great album, especially for fans of early Hopesfall. The members have moved on to newer and better things now, Brandon now does vocals for victory records band Across Five Aprils, Jonathon plays Guitar in Cake Records Dont Die Cindy, who won Warpedtour battle of the bands last year, and Steven is playing drums in Go Radio, be sure to check them all out :)"
5,Secret of Photo 51 DVD,"I'm a biology professor, and I love showing this DVD to my classes, to let them know that all the glory does NOT go to Watson and Crick for 'discovering' DNA, and that they actually stole a vital piece of data from a fellow scientist! It's also great for showing the importance of womens' contributions to the field of science, and how these early female scientists helped pave the way for women in science today."
4,Hungry for More Detail,"""DNA: Secret of Photo 51"" covers a lot of ground, but left me hungry for more of the technical details, especially those connecting DNA geometry with the X-ray images. But that's a quibble - - it shows that scientific discovery history isn't always black and white."
5,DNA: Secret of Photo 51,"When I read The double helix (JD Watson), I knew only one side of this critical episode. Watching the video I took the chance to understand, even partially, Rosalind's short-tempered behavior. I was very impressed with the richness of details, including the persuasive arguments presented by Brenda Maddox. I learned a lot.(I would apologise for my non-native english!!!)"
3,Melts,"Very attractive pot, but the base of the kettle is sealed with aluminum. If you accidentally boil the water out of the pot, the seal on the bottom of the pot disentigrates. And Copco doesn't have a website, so there's no way to know if there is any warranty on the item. I'll stick with $15 stamped metal pots. Not as fancy, but you aren't out $65+ if it fails."
3,Any Fulks is Good Fulks,"Robbie Fulks is a favorite of mine. His best work, for me, ranks right up there with Hank Sr, George Jones, and Johnny Cash. He's a brilliant songwriter and he has mastered many styles of country music. His best stuff, judging from this set, comes from the studio. No doubt he is great to see live, and this set has many gems, but none approach the genius found in 2005's ""Georgia Hard"" studio disc.There is plenty of fun, energy, good pickin', and a few new gems. Surely worth owning, but not a good starting place. Get this to complete your collection, but first be sure to hear Georgia Hard, South Mouth, 13 Hillbilly Giants, Let's Kill Saturday Night, Couples in Trouble, and The Very Best Of. Fulks has never made a bad record, and this one keeps up his winning streak. Still, I cannot wait for him to get back into the studio."
4,Robbie Fulks,Puts out another ripper album. Something for everybody here. Superb guitar playing. Excellent choice of tunes. Another winner from the House of Fulks.
5,Hugely entertaining,This is offbeat but the music is great and the humour works well. It's very entertaining and perfect for those moods where you feel a little weird and want something to hit the spot. This works perfectly.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys
5,Works great as a pre-filter!,I bought this material to make replacement pre-filters for my cats' Drinkwell 360 fountain. The pre-made filters are way too expensive. They are made out of the same material as this filter pad. I just cut the size I needs and make two pre-filters to stack on top of each other as the filter is tall. I have enough material for years worth of pre-filters. Great product!
4,ez,"electrical fundamentals explained about motors, phases, induction, capacitance, all the basic laws and then some. the first eight chapters are the primer for electrical setup in just about every small heating plant operation."
4,good service and excellent product,"excellent price, excellent service. checked back to see ifeverything went well. will order from them again."
2,How low can he go?,"I guess once on top of the world, the only place to go is down to the bottom. That's pretty much where this recording places him. What you get here is very much commercialized Pavarotti. If the man recorded his farts people would still go for it. That, could be an improvement over this CD, where he is hard put to hold a note with minimal quality.I have too many of his remarkable CDs to place this one among them. So, I'm throwing it away."
1,"Not bad, just a little much.","Not what I expected BUT that was my fault for not reading others reviews. The book we well written and didn't prolong the unneeded information.I would not recommend this to anyone with a light stomach, and I suggest reading people's reviews before reading the book. It is intense (and not in the lovey dovey way)."
1,not an erotic tale,The story lacked the sensual nature I usually enjoy with this type of story. I found the book to be boring and could not wait until I got to the end. I felt a total lack of connection to any of the characters and found Jonathan to be more of a bully than a dominant. I think this book was highly overrated!
3,Short,"This was a good Erotic book, but way too short for me. I took me no time at all to finish. If you are really into erotic stories, then this probably isn't for you, for me it wasn't detailed enough and was actually kind of slow, but the story was good."
1,"For a book with tons of kinky sex, it was pretty dull.","Really, for a book invovling tons of bondage and kinky sex, this book was pretty bland. For all of the emotional response that the main character had to all that she was going through, she could have been describing a visit to the post office or DMV. The author never really discussed WHY this woman would willingly allow herself to be enslaved, used, and abused; so it was hard to really care about what was going on. This is the first novel I've read by this author, and the last."
1,Can't believe this has the word erotic in the title,"If you are looking for erotic BDSM fiction, don't even bother opening the cover. Apparently, this may be a ""true to life"" story of a woman who is introduced into a world of hardcore BDSM, but why anyone would want that is beyond my comprehension. There is no relationship whatsoever here, no happiness, barely any intercourse, for that matter! I immediately deleted this book from my Kindle after finishing it (which I finished just because I spent money on it and was HOPING for some sort of happiness or pleasure ANYWHERE in the book). If you are into pain, humiliation, degradation, and constant unwarranted punishment, this is the book for you. I am so glad that the majority of BDSM fiction is not like this."
2,ewwwww,THis was a horrible story!! I still can't get the images outta of my head. I wanted an erotic boook to read I had no idea it would be so depressing and de humanizing..HORRIBLE!!!
3,"Educational....hell , it was amazing!","I say Educational because Carrie's Story was very interesting and for those persons who know nothing about Master & Slave scenarios, this is a learning experience. I started reading this book not knowing anything about the slavery side of BDSM and I closed this book wanting to experience it so badly.I encourage anyone to read it because it's not too raunchy and it keeps you on your twoes wanting to know what's next."
4,An enlightening stimulating story,A very good erotic book which includes a healthy amount of the sexual aspects of this young new slave. It seems well written and has enough plot so it isn't just one long boring story. Carrie seems to evolve and change as she learns what bdsm is about and then decides to continue the journey of her own accord.
3,Another interesting read.,"I bought this one to follow the earlier story, which I liked better. This one, while not as...dry? Slow? as Rebecca's Way, still will never be confused with one of the classics. It follows well with the earlier book, but jumps around a bit, and just doesn't flow as well. It keeps me from continuing the series.There is a good section on Pony Play, if you're into it..."
3,Ok for a quick read,"I read this book rather quickly. It is an easy read, but there's not a lot of scenery in this book. I prefer a book that really sets a scene well and this one falls short in that department. There's not much emotion or flowery details that paint a picture to visualize while reading.It's written almost matter of fact, and in my opinion leaves the story more on the boring side. I had just finished reading ""The Market Place"" series when I read this book and it pales in comparison for a lifestyle story."
3,Hmmm...,"It was ok. Not what I expected. I think I expected something a little bit more edgy then the story actually was. The character, Carrie, got into much detail on superficial subjects rather then what the book claims to be about.However, I did enjoy the book, don't get me wrong. Over all, it is well writen for a BD&SM; novel. I would recommend the Story of O first."
3,Not what I had hoped for...,"I can't say I enjoyed this book much at all. I should have re-read the preview before buying.This is not a romantic BDSM book, this is a book about a girl who wants to be a slave and lets herself be auctioned off after training with a man she met at a film party, for a year or so.If you are into the rituals of becoming a slave or being trained, or into pony training, then you might enjoy this book. It just wasn't for me."
4,"Not for beginners, but great story","I had my training sub read this book. She got very wrapped up in the story and the character, but there was several things about this story that scared her. This story has a lot of strong slavery and hummiliation in it. Also at first glance I didn't realize the story was very pony play related. In that context it is a great read. But I wouldn't recommend this as a early read for a sub who is just getting into BDSM."
2,Hmm,"Not real impressed with the story as a whole. The writing was good and the ending nice, but I felt sorry for Carrie. The ending made me realize she liked being belittled. Not the way D/s I pictured to be."
2,Carrie's Storry,Not a fan of this book. Loved 50 Shades series but this story was disturbing. Couldn't relate to the character. Why would a person want to be treated like Carrie was in the book?
4,Great Book - Rich in Historical and Personal Perspective,"""No Sweat"" is a great book, written by Bud Farrell, who flew as a gunner the b-29 ""No Sweat"" during the Korean War (1952 - 53.) It is not often that you get a combat aviation perspective from a member of the crew rather than from a member of the command flight deck. Farrell has the unusual talent of being able to bring you into his world of the early 50's and US Air Force by providing insights and perspectives of basic and flight training; the customs and mores of the Air Force crew hierarchy; the fear and boredom of combat missions; flight characteristics of the B-29; and finally, what awaited him on the home front. He provides a lot of detail but still managers to keep it interesting and flowing. If you are an aviation history buff, especially of the B-29, you need to read this book; you will not be disappointed."
5,Perfect Ingredient for a FABU holiday soiree,"(...)CC Part two is even better than the original. It's a kooky, retro, swanky mix of holiday classics with a twist. If you're a die-hard fan of classic Christmas tunes -- don't bother. But if you're in the mood for smooth holiday fun that might just get you a little mistletoe action, you need this CD!"
4,Not your typical Christmas jingle.....,"Ultra-Lounge has a very nice selection of music and it's great background music for get-togethers. Makes you crave a Martini, even if you're listening to it in the car!"
2,Could Be Alot Better!,"Except for cool tunes by Dino, Peggy, Nancy, Julie & the Ventures-the rest stink & sound cheesy."
4,Have another drink!,"This CD features Christmas music from the '50s and '60s that would have been considered to be ""adult pop"" at the time. That is to say, pop music for adults, instead of teenagers. There are a lot of great songs here, along with a few not so great songs. But it's all a lot of fun, and if you enjoy adult pop of the '50s and '60s, you should enjoy it."
2,Next: Son of Christmas Cocktails?,"I'm a big fan of the whole Ultra Lounge series (except for Mondo Exotica... that one's a little too weird even for me). LOVED Christmas Cocktails (I), but CC2 will take the pop out of your champagne. It feels like Capitol Records scraped the bottom of their archive barrel to dig up most of these. Still there are a couple of gems on here... and the Ventures' ""Frosty The Snowman"" ala ""Tequila"" is priceless. ""Snowfall"", if I don't miss my guess is a theme from ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and is done nicely too. Unfortunately the collection isn't as tailored as their others and sounds sort of like something thrown together by the marketing department instead of by a producer."
4,"ambitious subtitle, but certainly a nice collection","Several years ago, upon learning that a certain young woman enjoyed the poetry of Robert Frost, I began to memorize some of Frost's poetry. While this effort to impress her did not produce the desired outcome, it did introduce me to the pleasurable experience of memorizing poetry. I found that the act of committing a poem to memory brought out many of the poem's subtleties that I missed on previous readings. It's been quite a while since I've seen the lady who inspired my efforts at memorizing poetry, but I still enjoy coming to a closer understanding of a poem through memorization.It's hard for any poetry fan to take someone else's list of the ""100 best"" without balking at some of the choices, and I certainly had some question concerning many of the poems included in the anthology. On the whole, however, I enjoyed the collection, and found some new insight into some old poems."
3,Beautiful collection,Physically this is a lovely book. It sits well on a kitchen countertop and invites memorization as you wash the dishes and prepare food. The poems are indeed fun to memorize. My only wish is that it included poems from a more diverse pool.
2,Training your memory,"If the readers intention is to play a game of memory then this selection of poems can play the trick. But if your expectation is to have a first-rate selection of poems, then this book will run short of your objective."
5,handy for anyone who owns a saw or weedeater,"buying a case at a time, I know we have enough for any machine for any family member and not have to run to the store when you're ready to get some work done. small enough to fit in the toolbox"
5,Yogurt starter,I am so glad to have found this yogurt starter! There's nothing better than home made yogurt.
2,product not that good,I tried a few times and wasted lots of milk. It only partially worked. It was always very thin and did not set. I will not buy this product again.
4,Better than a thermos,"Despite what Andrew thinks, I think these are much better than a thermos for drinks. While slightly bulkier than a thermos, it serves much nicer at home, parties, meetings, etc. It isn't intended for clam chowder so of course, Andrew it won't work as well."
1,bad tangled wig,This wig is a one time wear only. Tangles easily. We threw it away after one to two weeks.
1,This is worthless,"I had bad dandruff. I've used nizoral 1st and it worked great on my scalp however its effects on my hair were disastrous. I've decide to try t-gel because the company promises to make the hair soft and manageable. Unfortunately, it has zero effect on my dandruff actually I can say they got out of hand. The smell is horrible and my hair is so tangled after my first use. It will go straight in the garbagge can"
2,Smells Horrid,"Been using this a while, smells horrible and hard to keep out of the eyes and it really irritates the eyes so taking a shower becomes a major chore to avoid getting this stuff into them. I stopped using Head And Folgers all together, it's of my honest opinion that that brand is rigged, most with sensitive skin need products with no scent to avoid irritating their skin etc, YET Head And Folgers is so rank with perfume I simply had to quit using it, you'd never manage let alone CURE dandruff or dermatitis using such scam products laden with irritants. ANY, this ALSO smells quite powerful, and it just seems like they INTEND to keep your condition in a stalemate situation where you'd be forced to use the product FOREVER in a vain money pit attempt at any type of true professional therapy. It's more than likely all a huge con.I think I'll just start using a bar of Dove sensitive skin unscented soap to wash my hair instead."
3,Didn't wear long enough to see results,"Judging by all the positive reviews I expect this stuff to work but it smells horrible. The stench is so strong to my nose. I collect colognes and so my nose is used to smell a lot of stuff and this stuff just offensive. After washing my hair and rinsing several times, I can smell this in my hair for over an hour afterwards. I don't even need to run my fingers through my hair and smell it... its just like an aura around my hair that stinks. Tried it for a couple days and I had enough.. If you don't mind the stench of tar, enjoy!I use head & shoulders instead. It works for me but is a bit damaging."
5,Good product,"I have had problems with dry scalp since my first pregnancy...i tried different shampoos and diets... then i learned that every young adult goes through the same thing because of skin changes, so on...so i decided to try this product...it has really helped me out...i recommend it to anyone ...it is gentle enough to use twice per day..like myself...but strong enough to make a difference. Amazon has excellent customer service...and excellent delivery time.... to bad not all the products on amazon are directly from and only from amazon..."
5,This stuff WORKS!!,This stuff really works!! I just used it one time and the difference was immediate. I literally feel as I have a new scalp now!
4,Excellent product not so good packaging,"The product is excellent, no news for me since I have been using it for over a decade now, but the packaging wasn't good and as a result some shampoo spilled from one of the 2 bottles. The bottle was not closely all the way down."
1,Be prepared to smell like you scrubbed with MOTH BALLS,"The smell of this product is so strong, and so invasive, that even after washing with normal shampoo twice, I was still smelling very, very, very, VERY strongly of moth balls. It is a terrible product. The smell is overpowering during usage and sticks with you for hours and hours."
1,BAD product!!!!,"I used it for months.. my scalp is worse, it's even drier and nasty. I wonder why there is good review here, this product is useless."
2,"Awful odor, old product","While the shipping was efficient, the product itself was awful. This is clearly a product that is very old, as it has Neutrogena's original scent as opposed to the still unpleasant, but much improved scent. The scent stays in your hair until the next shampoo. My little sister asked, ""why does your hair smell like dirt and dust?"" 3 hours after I washed and dried it. She is 4. Wish I hadn't bought the largest size!"
4,Relief - at least temporarily,"This may be a 5-star product compared to everything else out there. However, it does not cure the sensitive scalp so I can only give it 4 stars. Also it smells like hell. But that goes away after the shower. It will give you relief from symptoms which is more than anything else can do! I already ordered a huge new bottle."
5,did the job perfectly,"I have pretty severe seborrheic dermatitis that causes my hair to fall out in clumps if not maintained caused by a shampoo that I used for a while. I became really frustrated because I was using two types of expensive shampoos prescribed by the dermatologist and my hair continued falling out. My brother had been using this and I just started using it on a whim out of pure frustration. After the very first use, my scalp felt more clean and refreshed than it had in a very long time. After a couple of weeks the dermatitis had cleared up, the itching stopped, and my hair slowly but surely stopped falling out. I still have to use it in times of stress (which causes the scalp condition to break out again) and once a week on a normal basis just to maintain it but this is SO worth it. I don't know what people are complaining about the smell, it's honestly not that bad. I kind of like it to be honest, it smells clean."
1,"""new scent"" is very different formula","I've been using TGel shampoo for years, even though my doctor advised me I didn't have to. I like the original formula shampoo, the ingredients were nicely balanced for my hair, and my scalp didn't itch or flake.Now, with this ""new scent"" formula, the TGel shampoo is horrible. It makes my hair limp and without body. I can't do anything with it! Usually, my hair reacts that way when hair conditioner has been applied.My conclusion about the ""new scent"" is that the new formula has conditioner in it. I can't determine if there is a different scent than the original formula.I wouldn't have rated this any stars at all, but had to rate with at least one.Neutrogena has lost a long-time customer with this ""new scent"" product."
4,Season three- Hawaii five-0,"Another great series as Mc Garrett and Five-0 do what they are best at- solve crime. Great episodes like the Bomber and Mrs Maroney show the kinship between the officers as well as showcasing the lovely Hawaiian backdrop. Watch it and transport yourself back to a time when cops were cool and crooks got, ""BOOK EM""."
4,Third Season Even Better!,"Since it's introduction, I have purchased all three seasons. I was a little disappointed about the remastering of the first season, noting some grainy pictures. The third season seems to be much better. I told my wife that the quality is better than when i first saw it on TV with 525 scan lines on NTSC TV system. I watch these on my upconverted Philips DVD player to view it on 1080 and it looks great. Watching the Monopoly Thief, one of my favorites was worth it. Only down side was I wished there were more special features besides seeing the trailers. The sharper pictures makes this a very enjoyable set. Buy It!"
4,Hawaii Five O times three,who could not love Hawaii Five O? I find that I like the older shows better than the newer ones when the cast started to shift....my movie arrived on time as promised an in good condition. Highly recommend this one to the Hawaii Five O lovers out there!
3,Blu Ray anyone?,I've got a Blu Ray player so I'm not buying anything on DVD. DVD will go the way of VHS. Can we get this on Blu Ray?
5,GREAT,"Season 3 of Hawaii 5-0 was Great.The Lush settings of Hawaii looks Awesome on this DVD set.Good Storylines. Wo Fat returns in two stories.One small problem. I wish Kono and Chin Ho had a little more involvement on more episodes.Often it seems they say ""OK, Steve"" and Thats it for them.Looking forward to Season 4. Which I believe comes out on June 10th. YAY!"
5,Hawaii Five-0 and EMERGENCY,I have purchased 3 seasons of Hawaii Five-0 and 4 seasons of EMERGENCY! ALL of the DVD's are in excellent condition - great sound and visual on all products. I have children ages 6 - 12 - 14 and they now love the shows as well. I will be buying every season of these two shows and quite possibly other shows as well from Amazon...delivery has been excellent and often received before the projected date. I was VERY uneasy about trying to buy on-line...prices are lower with safe transactions. I highly recommend buying DVD's of the classic shows from Amazon.com.
4,G. B. Shaw: Intelligent Women's Guide .......,"It was written in the 20-s related to Engeland, but it is still actual and fresh for today.Easy to read and most educational."
3,A Journal of his travels,I have enjoyed Mr.Glasiers writing style and this book continues that trend. Most of the book reads like a travel journal. he saw this here and saw that there. that works very well for me because i know the character of Mr. Glasier. He does a wonderful job narrating our time travel back to the 1890's. with himself less the center of attension that he is in his other books. It is a good read.
3,Old man's child,"I still think that 'In the shades of life' is the best OMC record. This one's okay, but it has nothing on it that compares to 'Saint Aiden's fall' or 'Seeds of the ancient gods'."
2,death of good band,the pagan prosperity was great this is not. (vocals is good) this is death of good band
4,The Diablo Grant,Not one of Reasoner's best books; however not a bad story. It lacks some of the historical detail found in many of Reasoner's other books. If you want a quick read (only 200 pages) you will find it an entertaining western tale. I recommend The Healer's Road and Healer's Calling. The Wilderness Road is also very good.
3,Big disappointment after season 1,"I am a grown-up animation enthusiast, and quite a fan of Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Lab, Samurai Jack, Foster's Home and other cartoons with a cool retro-influenced design (50-60's), but this second season of Samurai Jack was a big letdown for me.Both graphically and story-wise everything seems much poorer, less surprising and less fun, less researched than on the first season.If you're a fan go ahead, this is still above average, but if you're looking for really outstanding stuff well you won't find anything better than season 1 here.I'd rather recommend you to check out Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, which is sweet, funny and sometimes emotional, and looks totally amazing.Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends - The Complete Season 1"
2,"I love Jack, but......","I've always been a fan of Samurai Jack. I watched it all the time on Cartoon Network and was disappointed when it was never on anymore. I think Phil Lamar does a great job with it. Season one was great and well worth the money.However...Season 2, in my opinion, was a bit of a let down. I only recognized the episode with the Scott's wife (so funny) and I could not even make it through disc one in a single sitting. I found the other episodes boring and to be over all much less visually impressive and well written than season one. I haven't watched disc 2 yet because I'm afraid it will be just as bad. But if you are truly much more devoted to the show than I am, maybe you'll enjoy most of them. But personally, I feel the producers just scrambled to make deadlines more than to create great animation."
4,Samurai Jack Season 2,"""Jack"" still remains the best animated series to come out in recent years. Sure, the Justice League is enjoyable entertainement but Jack is the freshest thing to come out in a long time!The stories continue to be new and refresshing and unlike the above mentioned animated series this is not your usual super hero series. The artwork is so completely differnet that naytthing else out there today and Aku is the best villian crerated for the little screen yet!If you don't have this box set get it-- you won't be dissapointed."
5,"Finally, Jack's back!","Jack's back and he comes with a bang. This DVD, I think hold some of the best episodes. I like this one JUST A BIT better than season 1. This DVD has some action packed episodes namely my favorite are: Jack and the Mauraders(however you spell that), Jack and the Hunters, and Jack vs. Demongo. Tjose episodes are some of my faves. I hope they come out with a season three very soon!"
3,honeysuckle,"I love the woodwick candles, they burn evenly and sound like a fireplace, but although I loved Jasmine and Fireside, I was disappointed in honeysuckle...it did not smell like honeysuckle to me. Jasmine was wonderful and I don't know if it was just me but I could not figure out what the honeysuckle candle I had smelled like. The candle itself is amazing and the very best quality and long burning candle I have ever bought, but honeysuckle did not smell like what I personally know honeysuckle to be. So, you might want to go to a store to smell it first before you buy."
5,Fun Doll!!!,This doll is great! She can pose in many different positions and you can dress her up in so many ways possible! It also teaches you how to take care of a real child when you grow up!
1,advertising diappointment,"I received an email from Amazon offering 50% off purchases of tools.I came across these nails at 50% off for $27.35 for 2500 pcs. Wow a smokin deal!I received my nails along with packlist.500 nails in the box packlist says 2500 nails as offered @ $27.35.No problem, I called Amazon and they sent me a return label and sent me out a new box of nails noting it should be 2500pcs. Received my new order. Same thing. Emailed amazon and they said since it happed twice there was no sense In trying again and again and gave me another return label.I'm just disappointed. This was my first negative experience with Amazon."
2,Not enough for a even small project,"It is hard to believe other good ratings. Although it is good quality & works fine with my guns, it is more costly to buy small package...only 20% compare to typical framing gun nail. Paslode at HomeDepot contain 2,500 nail in a box and it is much better deal than buying this small amount(500). This small box won't finish even small framing project anyway. This is the my first disappointment purchace from Amazon."
5,Test Drive Unlimited Playstation 2,Test Drive Unlimited shines in it's cockpit view that is accurate to the real car... A refreshing change... It's a addictive and interesting racing experience... There's no other driving game quite like it on the PS2... If your looking for something different and off the beaten path then this is for you.
2,Below Average,"Test Drive has made some great games, however this is not one of them. The controls are unnatural and the races are redundant. The best thing about this game is looking at the cars and their interiors. If your looking for a great racing game I suggest checking out Gran Turismo or Burnout Paradise."
2,OVERRATED,"There was way too much hype around this game. First of all, the graphics are comparable to many Gamecube games. All the cars sound the same. And, the storyline is horrible. Also, savefiles fail frequently, requiring you to reset the game and start from the beginning! the only good thing I can think up is that the game does have an amazing selection of cars. IMPORTANT: if you are going to get this game, be sure to use it's PS Online capability!"
3,Not much fun,The person I bought this for did not like this game. I guess because he could not defeat it.
3,Glory la gata ganster la gata de los ojos chinos,"plz note that i'm 14,just don't have account! =) Well i've alwayz liked glory cuz of her music and her look and her VOICE! i think her voice is interesting and she is a cool reggaeton artist. the best songs are PERREO 101 and aCELERA! i also like La Popola. i kinda expected more from her, though. i like her other songs like, Duro,la gata suelta,dame una noche loca, la bandolera,las gatas activas,gata gargola,tentacion y pecado, and fiera callada. plz her voice is interseting enough that all the reggaeton use her for the choruses( gasolina, tirate que voy sin jockey,gata celosa,gata salvaje,baila morena,etc.) maggie r. aka la gata ganster~~~desde miami fl. que viva panama~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,DA nExT PrInCeSS Of REgGeAToN,"DANG THIS ALBUM IS OFF DA HOOK, I LUV ALL DA SONGS OF GLORY!!!!WATCH OUT ADASSA HERE CUMS DA REAL PRINCESS OF REGGEATON :)"
5,Glory is amazing!,"I loved this cd, Very vibrant, contagious music, finally for me the best cd of Reggaeton that I already listened."
3,Ok CD/ but no IVY QUEEN!,"This cd is okay, but I still prefer listening to La Caballota Ivy Queen. The best songs are: La Traicionera with Don Omar, acelera and Perreo 101. If you are looking for a good reggaeton cd, check out:Nicky Jam "" Vida Escante""Ivy Queen ""Diva""Trebol Clan ""Los Bacatranes""Daddy Yankee ""Barrio Fino""This cds will keep you dancing all day long!"
4,Great series,"I bought this for my 8-year-old nephew. He really likes to read these on his own. They're short books, but perfect for kids starting to read. You really can't beat the price either."
3,Not really recommended,"The book is redundant - an example would be that every complaint that you look up starts with ABC's. You look up eye injury and the first page is ""is the patient breathing?"" .... Same with Headache, Gun shot, electrocution etc. The book does have some semi-useful information, but nothing that you couldn't find from another source that will probably be more valuable and informative. Another example that warrants my disapproval is that the book has a list of meds typically given with said complaint. Under Headache/Migraine, the only meds listed are Dilaudid and Phenergan..... .. .. The book gives a nice table about the TWO meds... TWO meds for a h/a... But this table is no different the the table for abdominal pain that lists the same meds... Dilaudid and Phenergan. This goes along with the redundancy issueI would recommend you keep your money."
2,No Guitar Tab - Arranged for Piano,"There is no guitar tab. There is only chord diagrams. It's entirely generic. Maybe you will like it if you are a piano player that can read music notation. But I play intermediate/advanced guitar and read tab so I am very dissappointed. Why would Cherry Lane publish a Bob Dylan book with all the music arranged for piano? Stupid. Well, at least it has the lyrics."
5,GREAT carafe!,"If you want your liquid to stay HOT, you will need a glass-lined carafe or thermos. Dual-wall stainless steel lined carafes just won't cut it. After disappointing results with recent purchase of another brand, we tried this Zojirushi. This glass-lined carafe is the best one we've used to date. Coffee made in the early morning remains steaming hot and tastes just-brewed even 12-hrs later. I'm confident that it would still be hot (not just ""warm"") the following morning if I didn't drink it all before then. Easy to rinse & clean, there are no problems with water in the lid or functional issues that other reviewers have experienced. I'd recommend this to anyone who really wants their liquids to remain hot. Be aware, if you pass over this model in favor of any brand that's stainless-lined, you're compromising performance. This is the one."
4,Keeps it hot,"Nice unit, does the job well. Give it a brief hot-water fill (1/2 container full will do the trick) before pouring in your final liquid & it'll work even better.This was a good purchase, well worth the price, wish I'd done it long ago. I use it every day to store freshly-made coffee."
5,zorirushi purchased thru amazon,Great product. I already had a Gevalia carafe that did not keep anything hot for very long. The coffee about burned my mouth even after several hours. That was just what I was looking for! I highly recommend it.
5,Nice product,Excellent product but poor packing. The replacement was shipped fast. I enjoy this product every day.
4,Great Thermal Carafe,"I purchased this carafe as a repl'mt for a previousone made in China(A PIECE OF JUNK). This one is quality!I am very pleased with the product. It does everythingas advertised. I highly recommend htis carafe.Zojirushi Premium Thermal 1-Liter Carafe, Brushed Stainless Steel"
4,Why I gave my carafe a 4...,"This product has been great. If I leave my coffee in it in the morning, when I come home in the afternoon it is still hot. I like it because my coffee stays fresh, it saves on electricity, and I can keep it handily on my kitchen table or counter. One thing I can think of to improve the product is where it says open and closed on the top of the carafe, it would be helpful if when it was closed, the word ""closed"" was written on red. This would make it easy to remember to keep it closed. The inside of the carafe is glass, and I would buy another in a heartbeat."
3,Temperate Zone,"This carafe keeps coffee moderately hot until you start on the second cup of coffee. Of course, then the temperature starts to dip. But it does keep coffee warm ""enough"" so that a 10 to 15 second nuke in the microwave will get it piping hot again. At no time, did I ever get the carafe to keep the coffee scalding hot. I do like the push button for pouring."
1,Shiny Interior Coating Deteriorates!,I was very pleased with this thermal carafe. I used it almost daily to hold hot water for tea. After about 6 months I noticed shiny specs floating in the water. I thought maybe it needed a good cleaning with detergent. 3 months later I noticed discoloration inside the carafe. Using a wooden chopstock I gently rubbed it against the interior of the carafe. The interior was now rough not smooth. The chrome plating (or whatever it is) was slowly eroding. I immediately threw it away.No more carafes for me. I bought an electric tea kettle.
5,Keeps hot water hot!,"So far this has been a great product. I've had it for about a year and a half and have used it almost every day to hold boiling water for making tea. So far it has held up great. This carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours. When I leave the water in it for 24 hours, the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it.I have never used this item to store anything else other than water; but in theory, you should be able to make tea or coffe the night before and still have it hot in the morning 6 to 8 hours later, assuming the liquid is boiling when you pour it in.Some of the heat from the water is lost from the initial contact with the carafe, so the liquid you store will always be a little cooler than its intial temperature."
5,"Well made, keeps liquids hot!","I was looking for a carafe to keep my coffee hot during the day when I work from home. I like to brew about 3-4 cups to drink as the day passes by, and this carafe fits the bill. It surprised me on how hot my coffee remained even after 4 hours. I don't ""prime"" it however as the instructions suggest (by filling it with hot water and letting it sit for a few minutes before pouring the coffee inside) so I would think it will keep my coffee hot even longer if I did this. I like the push button open/close feature to pour with, and it's easy to clean with a good bottle brush."
1,Mine is a lemon,"Unlike most of the buyers of this carafe, I found it to be a serious disappointment, thanks to a major design flaw. The open-and-close mechanism is a dud. After pushing the handle knob to ""open,"" what I get from the spout is little more than a trickle. Returning any product costing less than $25 is such a hassle that I'll just toss it and eventually buy another one, but a more expensive one from another manufacturer -- and keep my fingers crossed."
5,Zojirushi Thermal Carafe,"This carafe keeps coffee hot for hours. I highly recommend it and use it daily.My only small criticism, is that when pouring the last drops of coffe a little will spill due to the inner lip created by the small mouth of the thermal liner. I think this shape is necessary to conserve heat. It's just best to forget trying to pour the last couple of tablespoons of coffee at the table and just rinse it out over a sink.I really think this carafe is great."
1,Don't buy this,"On my way to the garbage can with my Zojirushi carafe, I decided to write a review. The pot keeps coffee hot for a long time, but it is so frustrating to close with the push-button feature that I have decided to just get rid of it. I agree that liquid accumulates in the lid--definitely unsanitary-- and I find that it doesn't pour well when it gets close to empty. The biggest problem is the push button. Once it is pushed to the open position, it may or may not close when pushed again. Guests have commented on this problem and I have managed until recently to close it with several thumb jabs. After trying to close it about twenty times yesterday, I gave up. The thing is trash."
1,Bad design,"I wanted to love this carafe. I got it as a gift for my husband and had read reviews about the inability to clean it thoroughly, but it was much worse than I thought. The lid has inside channels where the coffee and water filter in, and no amount of shaking can get it all out. The directions say not to submerge it, and i didnt, but it still is filled with water and coffee and gross.The topper was that the body of the carafe is not attached to the thermal lining with a gasket, so water can and does get in between the layers. Just by rinsing it under water, it goes into all the layers. Then drips out slowly from a small hole in the bottom of the carafe. Really? This is a stupid design. Whoever designed this should be fired. It's a breeding ground for bacteria. I sent it back."
1,Design Flaw,"Terrific product with a major design flaw, which is the thumb lever to open/close. Previous reviews reported this problem, which I did not heed. After a year of use, I am throwing it away, which is a shame as it is excellent in all other respects. The thumb lever, a small, cheap component, is permanently frozen. The screw top cap will not open and close anymore without seriously banging the top of the cap. Switching to a standard, old fashioned, screw top thermos for the morning coffee. See my previous review for the 1.85 model."
3,GOOD PRODUCT NOT GREAT,"I bought this one based on some of the praises from other reviewers. I must say, this is a nice piece, but keep liquid STEAMING hot for 12 hours or more? NO! I put hot water in the thermas before adding hot coffee. Even doing this trick, coffee stays hot enough without microwaving it for about FOUR hours. This is not bad, but all day? NO WAY. I like my coffee HOT. If you are happy with ""warm"" coffee, then 8 hours is more like it. Very attractive design and pouring mechanism works as advertised. I have a Nissan thermas (all steel)that keeps things hotter longer, although that one was about twice the price. However, they last forever and I'd pay 20.00 more for it and buy only ONE."
5,Absolutely amazing!,We got this to keep warm water near our baby's changing station. I put hot water in on a Thursday night at 8pm or so and used it little by little over the next few days. Saturday morning at 7am the water was still warm enough to use!
2,Sent as a gift!,This DVD was sent as a gift to a student for a school project. He said that it was helpful.
4,Animal Farm Review,"The story was as good as ever, but no one can replace the voice of Orson Wells in the original. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. There were no problems with the order. We received it in just a few days."
4,New View of the Farm,"This is not a literal rendering of Orwell's great fable but an imaginative fanasty on it. I found it surprisingly moving and inventive. The animals, both in natual action and computerized enhancement, are well ""directed"". While the human sub plot is grafted to the animal main action in a somewhat gratutious fashion, this is very a minor factor in a very skilled production. The voice overs by great English actors, are delivered with sensitivity to the drama. You won't ever forget the clever parody of fawning Stalinistic documentaries. The musical score is extremely effective and affecting. The passionate negative reviews of this film are due,I would think, to one's passionate attachments to Orwell and expectations of a more literal (and less sentimental) visual embodiment of the book. On its own ground, this is a beautiful little movie. Try it and you may like it. And cry."
2,the book was better...,"I know, that's what they always say. But _Animal Farm_ with a happy ending? That alone would be enough to turn me off, but this movie also suffers from a bit of a time dilation problem: the pigs become corrupt in about 15 seconds of screen time, rather than gradually as they do in the book. To top it off, this movie's direction is so heavy-handed it makes Orwell look like a master of subtlety."
3,Animal Farm,Its a decent film to use in a history classroom. It gives students the chance to see why communism in the Soviet Union did not work in a non-traditional way. It is not a great film for entertainment but useful as a teaching tool.
1,Animal Farm (1999),"Even though there were several pretty horses I did not like this at all. The leader of the farm, a pig, gets killed and this skull is placed on a stick (flies also) by the other ;animals. Animals are slaughtered and it shows the shadow of some people getting 'jiggy', plus the head board hitting the wall. I turned it off. My parents were shocked since it is rated ""G""...but this could scare little kids and is not a ""G"" movie. I got it becasue I hoped it would be like the movie ""Babe"". It was not."
4,Duh? Communism,"Did any of you people know that animal farm can be read on 2 fronts? It is not only about animals. It is also a mock of the russian revolution and a start to communism. If you had every went to school you would know about the Bolsheviks, Leon Trosky, or come on even Joseph Stallin. It was only 50 years ago. I give animal farm 4 stars because it illistrates how much communism sucks. Be glad you r the capitalist u r. We will never become a communism or we wil all die."
1,Revisionist Ruination of a Classic,"They destroyed Orwell. I can't believe it. These people actually destroyed that great author. Did they do it deliberately? I don't know. I'm still trying to figure that out.I think perhaps they did. After all, they completely altered the ending. I mean completely, 180 degrees, different from Orwell's pure and clear intention. There ought to be a law against that. Defamation, slander, anything.What if Orwell wasn't writing about Russian communism, persay, but rather, about the nature of totalitarianism in general (which the world and Russia and this country are NOT rid of, by the way!)? Have these myopic movie-makers never considered that? Obviously not.And they also made a trite, saccharine-sweet movie. Thus, they made the great Orwell seem trite. How dare they?!"
1,Beware!,"For any of you teachers out there who plan to watch this in your classroom with your students: BEWARE!! First of all, I've heard of taking ""liberties"" with a book but this is ridiculous! Sex between Farmer Jones and the neighbor farmer's wife is not in the book, but sure is shown in the movie. I was shocked to see them rolling under the sheet as the headboard was ""knocking against the wall"". Utterly revolting and embarassing for me and my students. I expect better from Hallmark Entertainment, Family Home Entertainment, etc...Second, there is a ""no rating"" statement on the DVD - I'm angry about this and don't appreciate being taken advantage of. There was no warning about adult situations. It's a shame that one can't be truthful in advertising. Buyer Beware!"
4,Animal Farm review,"I teach Animal Farm, by George Orwell in my English class--this is a good representation of that novel."
3,Good adaptation,"This is a well-done adaptation of the book. It isn't perfect, but kids like it much better than the 1950s cartoon version. For teachers looking for a good version to accompany the book, I recommend it. I have used both and sometimes use both as a good jumping off place for discussion."
2,do yourself a favor and read the book!,"If you need to see a visual, then watch the cartoon version from the 50's. Granted, the endings are different in both movie versions i.e., the animals bringing Napoleon to justice in the cartoon and the sappy, [bad] ending to the 1999 film. The film had great potential, but moviegoers want to see a happy ending and that's what the 1999 film delivers. The cartoon is much darker and Napoleon actually looks evil. Plus there is too much focus on the humans in this move, which are hardly even mentioned in the book. Also, this movie totally missed the point of Animal Farm's underlying theme of the fall of communism. Well, I've yapped enough..just read the book or, if you must, see the cartoon. Avoid this movie."
2,Disappointing,"This missed a lot of the stuff in the book and made it family-oriented. If you are expecting it to be like the book, expect differently. It is unlike the book and there are major changes which make it a bad adaptation."
4,"Stark, well-done adaptation - Not for the Kiddies","A very stark and powerful adaptation of the Orwell classic...a true surprise considering it premiered on TNT. Although the ending may have been sightly ""lightened"", the film as a whole is very adult and may be too intense for young children expecting another ""Babe"" movie. Definitely way above-average for a tv-movie...PLUS, the DVD version is actually in WIDESCREEN although the keepcase and every other listing indicates it's in it's TV ""full-frame"" version! So you get that definite bonus plus lots of kind of worthless extras...but it's definitely worth the very reasonable price. Image quality is excellent as well...I noticed no pixelization at all."
3,DASHEIKS 2 CENTS,"I thought this movie was a pretty good adaptation of the book but in my opinion if a movie does not resemble the book in every frame and aspect it fails. ""Animal Farm"" the movie is a failure. Old major looked rediculous. He may as well had been played by Kermit the frog. And to my disappointment, the ending of the book where a card game takes place and cheating is discovered (my favorite part of the novel ) is just left out and replaced with a happy ending. DREADFUL!!! ""Animal Farm"" is one of my all time favorite books and I have been waiting for a movie adaptation ever since I read it in high-school. I've probably read it at least 3 times. I always said I'd prefer an animated cartoon version instead of a live action one. When I saw the ""Babe"" movie I became alright with the prospect of a film created with this technology. I have been betrayed and in my opinion so has George Orwell. This film is an UTTER disappointment!"
3,The Animal Farm,Its an old VCD and the narrator narrated the story not according to the plot of the story book itself.
2,My Two Cents,"This movie scared the hell out of me! I had always heard that pigs were purported to be rather intelligent. But duplicitous? Machiavellian? Pitiless? What cruel fate awaits us at their greedy hands or feet or whatever? All I can say is that the very moment I was informed of the premise of this movie I ran right out of the house and downed a fistful of bacon. After all, if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem."
1,Happy ending for Animal Farm? Orwell would hate it,"TNT wasted the emormous talent of its team and guests to produce the happy ending that Orwell would both hate and understand. Combining this with the happy ending to th eproducers on broadway leads me to the next ""happy colorization"" of historically sginificant dark stories --------------- Life after death of a salesman (Arthur Miller) Willie Loman will buy, then short Amazon, and live happily ever after."
2,Not like the book.,"Everyone is subjected to their own opinion. In my opinion, I truely dislike this movie. The book is highly more interesting. The characters only make noises and grunt. I NEVER fall asleep and enjoy almost every movie that I see, but this particular one... is terrible. I never had the best sleep in my life until that movie came along. The conclusion is slightly off of the book too. The writer omited a lot of stuff from the book."
3,service took too long,"The DVD arrived too late for me to use it at school. Also, it's pretty scratched on the back."
4,"A Good Adaptation...A Hard ""Movie"" To Pull Off","Okay, for all those who are fans of the Orwell classic, you have to understand how difficult this tale is to bring to the big or small screen. We're dealing with talking animals relating to humans. This tale is too deep for the ""movie public"" and ANY movie will fall short for true purists.Taking it for what it is, it is an accurate depiction of the novel. The reviewer who didn't see Moses the Raven in the story must have watched a different film.It is really difficult to get people today to feel the horror of what Animal Farm represented when originally written. Take that and put it under the Hallmark label and it can be just plain confusing for those who haven't read the novel.I truly enjoyed this film. I reccomend it for all. Even if it is a little difficult to follow. Unlike the box says, it is NOT for children."
4,This is a great deal at the time for the price,The only problem is that Pacific Digital sells better DVD R/RW Drives for less now.
3,Hamell hits it...,"This is a great album if you're a fan of the man. His lyrics are as inflammatory and inspirational as ever. Though no studio album could ever completely convey the energy that is felt when witnessing his on stage intensity, it comes close. However he's not the type of artist that you can listen to lightly. His quick lyrics and hard playing will tire your mind if you're not game. Be prepared to rage a little before you put him in you disc player."
3,Not bad.,"I am not sure how it rate this product. One one hand my hair is less frizzy when I blow dry it, I have to use very little finishing serum or none at all. On the other hand i dont like the texture of it, it doesnt run smothly through your hair so you need to use a lot of it to cover all your hair."
2,Unimpressed,I've used a lot of hair masques and most are much more effective than this. I left the product on my hair for almost 10 minutes and didn't notice any difference afterward. It was as if I hadn't even conditioned my hair that day. Try the masque by Biolage for something more effective that's a comparable price.
3,Conditioner,"Although this conditioner smells great and does leave my hair very soft, it is probably a little on the expensive side for everyday use."
5,Roots of Sweet Philly Soul,"This album from 1968 marked the beginnings of the Sweet ""Philly Soul"" sound of the 70s, with lovely vocal harmonies set to lush orchestral backgrounds.""Beak Your Promise,"" as well as the remakes, are well done. But it's realy interesting to listen to ""Can You Remember."" Most people today associate this song with the Jackson 5's lovely version, but this is the original and is just as fine."
2,Not so Excellent for Beginners!!!,"Although the author addresses all the topics newbies might be curious about, her negative attitude and comments make one wonder why she is in the swinging lifestyle. Her ""collection of personal experiences and opinions"" would scare off anyone who might be thinking about entering into the lifestyle. Although much of the information she provides is helpful, as experienced swingers we have encountered much more positive situations than she describes. After reading the entire book, we commented to each other that had we read it beforehand, we probably wouldn't have ever started."
2,not so great,"Not what I wanted at all, the wrong colour and it barely fits around my neck. I pretty much threw it out as soon as I got it."
2,fifty celebret fifty,"Very disappointed, most women interviewed did not express how they felt, what they do to stay in shape ie diet,exercise,activities, advice on looking and feeling young and how they view life today verses yesterday. More or less it talked about their careers and who they are married to if any."
5,Great book,"I will be fifty years old on February 17, 2004, if the Lord allows. This book is interesting, inspiring and worth the money; and it has great photographs. Not done reading it yet--I wanted to save some of the goodness for later. Please check it out--it makes a great coffee-table book as well."
1,Taye Diggs in a southern accent doesnt cut it,"this movie is a great waste of time. with its annoying litle rich brat kids and one of them kills their new best friend and Diggs incestigates with the worst soutern accent in the world, plus he shouldnt of been in this whole mess. with a bitchy cast and a nowhere story, this'll please those people with less than zero brains"
4,extention handle,"This what I needed to save my knees and back. It does both quite well. Just wish there was a ""lock-on"" position for continuous operation."
2,awkward,"Awkward to use and easily broken. I damaged mine trying to get it to work and gave up on it. A string trimmer was easier to handle, faster and more durable."
1,Disappointed,i ordered an item that didn't work for what i wanted it for. the desription of the item should have had more detail. I returned it and found out it cost almost as much to return as the item cost in the first place. i am still waiting for credit to my account for the shipping cost. how long should that take to show up ?
2,Longevity of tool,"The tool is manufactured to be replaced when the battery has to be replaced. On initial inquiries,local home centers will not repair it unless bought at their stores and under warranty. B&D charges $23 for the replacement battery and this does not include labor. If you understand its cheaper to get a new one instead of replacing the battery, then it's a nice tool."
4,Good Addition!,This is a very nice accessory for the GS500/DS600. Save your knees and your back. Hooks up with ease and works beautifully. Can't go wrong with this purchase.
5,One of the best novels about adolescence ever,"I devoured this book when it came out in 1975, and it still holds up: Anyone who was ever a teenage girl, who loves to read about New York or Boston, or the late 1940s. Anne Bernays is a master prose stylist, and this is still my favorite of her books."
5,"Great Dining Table, worth the price.",We're very pleased with our new dining table. The quality is great and it looks great.
3,"Beautiful product, but disapointing service.","The dining room set is gorgeous and it was a great bargain, but not all the hardware was included when it was shipped and then wrong hardware was shipped the second time. I had the table leaning up against my wall for a month until the right harware actually arrived."
3,Another great Zatiochi entry,The blind swordman must fight his former master. Great story and lots of sword-clashing action that can only be delivered by Shintaro Katsu.
4,The hero that never gets the girl.,"Zatoichi's appeal has a lot to do with his imperfections. He's blind, lacks social status, and is not proud of his own legacy of violence. Yet he's motivated by compassion and a sense of justice that prompt him to take action, whatever the consequences.And then there's the dazzling use of his sword.As blind swordsman and itinerate massuer, Zatoichi, the late actor Shintaro Katsu walks you through the bright spots and corrupt dark alleys of Edo period Japan.In ""Massuer Ichi Enters Again"" (1963) Zatoichi finds love, meets his old fencing teacher, and characteristically rights some wrongs on the way.Katsu is definitely in his prime, and the film is a sheer pleasure to watch. (MW)"
3,Bend...but Ok,"I was glad to find these simple round cut-outs on Amazon - however, when they arrived they were partially bend, and after several attempts to make them completely round, I think I got them as circular as I am going to get them...Obviously I was disappointed that these arrived bend because Wilton typically makse great products -"
2,Teeny Tiny little circles,"These cutters are comically small. From the amazon ad I thought the circumference of the circles and the height of the metal would be greater (for creating cookies and biscuits). The packaging clearly indicates that these are for creating ""fun shapes from rolled fondant."" Oops.Also - each circle is made from a single piece of metal, and where the overlap where the two ends meet isn't smooth, so it might leave a small bump on the final circle you cut out."
1,eh,This product is a joke. The sizes are really quite limited as far as usefulness and are poorly made. I ended up investing in a higher quality set with a more practical range of uses.
1,Thank god it finally broke!,"Now I don't feel so bad for throwing it away. The metal piece at the mouth finally broke off after 3 years. I bought it because it looked so nice but when I took it home, I found that it dirtied easily, looked terrible and was terrible to wash. My biggest complaint? When water poured, it splattered hot water anywhere BUT the stupid mug. Pretty much downright dangerous."
1,agree with previous review,"i had the same experience with the red kettle that the previous reviewer had, the lever for the pour spout broke off during the second month. i complained ..., they put me in touch with copco and they're going to replace it--although the red seems to be discontinued. it was so cute, but not at all sturdy!"
1,Makes Smelly Water!,What more do I need to say. This was a free tea kettle and after a few uses we won't even give it away. It makes water that smells like plastic even after we scrubbed it a bunch of times... (I found great Kettles by doing an Amazon search based on customer rating!)
4,Attack with Mikhail Tal,"This book is broken down into sections covering a variety of attacking themes and prerequisites for launching decisive attacks on your opponent's king. By playing through the many fantastic examples presented in the book, one sees over and over the beauty of sacrificial, tactical chess. I enjoyed this book very much and would recommend it to anyone who loves the game."
2,Interesting but still more repetition,"Lindsey always holds a person's attention, but much, maybe half, of Vanished is almost a word-for-word repeat of what appeared in his 1983 book The Rapture. Nevertheless it's worth the money."
1,Hal Lindsey is a cottage industry in end-time books.,When I was in high school 25 years ago some friends and I read a number of this man's books; of course at that point he thought the end was 1984. The only reason to read Lindsey is to get you reading your Bible but why not just read your Bible and skip this blap. Your own mind and heart will bring Scripture alive for you; you don't need someone like this.
1,Deja vu all over again...,"Could you write basically the same book every year or so and still sell enough copies to keep publishers salivating for your next book? Lindsey can. I suppose this is because Christians have such short memories, or such poor theological appetites. This book is simply a reworking of his previous book on ""the rapture,"" released several years ago. Try to find a respected dispensationalist theologian who will endorse Lindsey--I double dare you. If dispensational premillenial pap is your speed, then this book is for you. If you are like me, you would like to see the title come true: ""Hal Lindsey Vanished into Thin Air: The Hope of Every [Thinking] Christian."""
1,"Pathetic, horrific, unbiblical, ad infinitum...","This book is filled with confused theology. It promotes blatant Arminianism. It embraces Open Theism. It is abounding in *ad hominem*. It's one *non-sequitur* after another. It's theory upon theory upon theory that is touted as fact under the guise of, ""Any sound scholar knows that..."" It is the epitome of tabloid prophecy theology.I'm just about done with this book. I had truly hoped to get a scholarly take on Dispensationalism. After reading Ice, House, and Fruchtenbaum (all supposed Dispensational theologians), I'd hoped to find something of substance in ""Vanished Into Thin Air."" Instead what I got was one of the worst cases of postmodernism, sensationalism, and unbiblical theory, that I've read.I am going to post a full and comprehensive review on our web-site (www.bridgewaybible.com) when I am done with this book. It should be about 2 weeks. Please feel free to visit the site and give me your thoughts.In Him,Dustin..."
5,The single best book I have ever read on the rapture!!!,"This is the single best book I have ever read on the rapture and all the questions related to that subject. Lindsey does a thoroughly scholarly job in examining all the scriptures on the rapture and on the second coming. He sets out by putting aside his pre tribulation, pre wrath, and pre millennial views instead seeking nothing but the truth from the scriptures; He also examines the history of the belief (this part is a must for reconstructionists). What ever you believe about the rapture; this is a must read book; it will challenged many assumptions and also strengthen others. I won't get into what Lindsey's conclusions are, I will let you find out that for yourselves. Let me just give this book Vanished Into Thin Air the highest possible recommendation."
5,Beauty,A beautiful woman makes the most lovely italian music you can imagine! I am in love with her and with this album already for more than 15 years and cant get enough!
5,An excellent addition to your REM collection...,"It's always nice to hear the old favorites performed in different ways. For me, the album was well worth its price simply for the cover version of Dream. The way the band harmonizes on that simple song is incredible."
2,Problem with it not responding,"Well it a neat little keyboard, good stirdy aluminum case, folds up small and thin, opens to a good size, the keys have good tactile feel, and the stand is stable. I'm using it with a SJ22 and I'm having trouble with it. After a number of keys it dosen't respond and I have to plug it out and back in for it to recognise it. I tried the driver on the sony site and the one from the cd with the same problem. I don't know if the fault lies with keyboard or the handheld. I had a palm m105 with the original stowaway and althought the palm was slow, I never had recognition problems."
5,March Book!,"The March Book is incredible and unforseen, as any great book must be. Not since ""Lord Weary's Castle"" has a poet been heralded in such a fashion by the work itself. Just as Lord Weary's Castle astounded not by innovation but by consummate skill and breadth, here we see Jesse Ball triumph in the sheer strength of his imaginative powers, in the sheer clarity of his delivering thought. The poems here function fundamentally on the level of thought, winding in and out of various conceptions, various intents. What elevates this book most of all however is its philosophy of careful hope; hope set against weariness, betrayal, suffering. This may not be a new argument, but no one else is couching it as Ball is, in a theater of such implacable momentum."
5,superlative choral music,This is a magnificent portrait of the man and his music.A must buy for those who appreciate melodic choral music.Laurisden recieved the presidential medal of honor in 2004.His music is performed all over the world
1,NO DELIVERY-NO REVIEW,"How am I supposed to review a product that I've been informed that it was shipped in July 16th, 2005 and which I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED (it is August 2nd, 2005), even though my credit card has been charged 2 weeks ago????And I have NOBODY TO CALL AND FIND OUT ABOUT IT!!!!!e-mail me, ASAP"
4,Comic genius but beware Season 1.,"Well written with superb performances from Jack K., Tony R. and most of the supporting cast. Sure, it's an old series made for a US audience but the 70's styles and occasional US-specific gag does not diminish the real enjoyment and delights of this comic masterpiece. Beware Season 1. ""The first season of the show was quite different from the ones that followed. It was filmed using only one camera, and used a laugh track instead of a studio audience. Many characters from the original play appeared in the show but, when the second season began, many were eliminated and the show filmed in front of a live studio audience with three cameras"". Though the performances and writing are good, the absence of a live audience, the single camera and a laugh track do make the experience rather less joyous. Try starting with Season 2. By the time you have finished season 5, you may be so desperate to see more of Jack and Tony that Season 1's failings become unimportant."
4,Good purchase,I had difficulty finding this product. Was pleased to locate it on Amazon. It arrived earlier than expected & is exactly what I was looking for.
2,Butchered Episodes!!!!,"I am appalled how these episodes have butcherd to delete any type of singing. My guess is that Paramount was too cheap to pay for the rights for the music. If so, give the rights to the Odd Couple BACK to Time Life! All you are doing is CHEATING true Odd Couple fans by editing some of the funniest moments from these episodes.One thing for certain, I am NOT rushing out to buy any more seasons until I am assured that I am purchasing FULL UN-EDITED episodes.If I wanted cut episodes, I could just wait till they are on TV Land or use my old VHStapes, and make my own DVDs."
2,"5 Stars for the show itself, minus 3 stars for the glaring cuts","Not gonna go into detail. If you're interested in this, you most likely are familiar with the show. The show itself is great, but the cuts they've made are very frustrating for fans. I just wanted to lend my voice to this."
3,Great Show but more edits from Paramount,Just saw a picture of the rear box art for season three and once again there is a disclamer from Paramount about edited episodes and music changes. The Odd Couple is one of my favorite TV shows and season three was a great season but its really disturbing that Paramount will not give us the complete unedited original music versions. So far only season one escaped this and that was the only season not originally released by Paramount. Of all the companies that release TV shows on DVD Paramount is by far the worst as far as music changes are concerned.
4,if only for 1 episode.....,"Having not been released yet, I'll just say, for those of us over 40....the ""Password"" episode alone may be worth the price."
5,Awesome Show,"This is quite simply one of the funniest television shows ever made. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on something fabulous."
1,Such a disappointment,"I can't even begin to explain the disappointent in this DVD set. Odd Couple fans have been waiting for decades for this series to be released on DVD. When they finally get around to it, they give us these inexcusable edited versions. I have counted at least five episodes with deleted, changed, or shortened scenes, due to someone (usually Felix) singing a few lines from a song. (""Sweet mystery of life"" from 'The Odyssey Couple'; ""Secluded Rondevoux"" from 'Role Reversal'; ""Sun in the morning.."", from 'Murry who came to Dinner'; ""Look for the Silver Lining"" from 'The Odd Monks', and ""Peg of my heart"" from 'The Odd Couples')I think someone owes true fans of the series an explanation. Other than here, where can we register our complaints? The sad fact is, if we do, instead of correcting them, they will probably respond by not releasing the 4th and 5th seasons. Shame on Paramount!How sad.amp427"
2,Keep Away From Edited Sets,"I was thrilled to hear that season three of The Odd Couple was being released. It is my favorite TV show of all time, and I have the first two seasons which were released in near perfect condition. However, the same isn't true for season three.Season three sees The Odd Couple butchered like never before. It's a shame that fans might never again see the episodes in their original form. As a big fan of classic TV, I feel like I've put up with this long enough. I bought season one of The Cosby Show and Roseanne -- both edited -- and all four edited seasons of ALF. I even went so far as to purchase WKRP. But this one takes the cake. There is no way I am putting down good money for an edited set of The Odd Couple.So long Oscar and Felix."
2,Some scenes were cut,"Well being a huge Odd Couple fan I was excited when Paramount released these DVDs.Also being a huge fan I was disappointed with the 3rd season DVD. I've noticed some scenes were deleted that were in when I would watch the show on TV. Scenes that were funny and added to the episode. I don't know why ANYTHING would be deleted from these DVD versions. I foolishly thought by purchasing the DVD I would be getting full uncut episodes. I understand that when old shows are aired in repeats they have to edit them a bit to allow for commercials. But in my opinion, and I'm sure this goes for all the other Odd Couple fans, We should get the ORIGINAL UNCUT episodes as they originally aired."
5,Great Little Bag,"I love this bag, I have used mine for well over a year, it allows me to keep my sunglasses, the faceplate for my car CD player, my checkbook, and it has enough slots for every credit card and piece if ID I ever need just in the tall zip-around area. I keep a small wallet in the first side zip compartment and my cell phone in the front compartment with the snap. It also has 2 inside zipper areas for safe keeping. The strap is adjustable to wear over my shoulder short or long and across my chest if I need it safe. Its a great bag for travel or any reason.I love mine."
5,Great small bag,I've had this bag for a while and keep going back to it. It's a good small bag to take shopping if you don't want to be weighed down with a large tote. I pack in into by briefcase and take it out when needed to carry to lunch. I am going to get a second color.
3,The Great Matthau not at his best.,Matthau is not at his best in this movie. The story was straining to be enjoyable and missed the mark..
3,works sometimes,this unit is nice to the large display and the little side but the unit has trouble getting a signal from the remote sensor it seems the station only gets a signal the first 5 hours after resetting but i went for 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 stars because the transmition may be linked to the batteries but then again i have to replace the batteries every monthbut for the times the unit works its a nice station
5,Considering a tractor project? Better read this book!,"Sometimes the truth hurts so bad that you just have to laugh.I had a hard time putting this book down once I started reading. I felt Rog's pain every time he related breaking a part or smashing a finger, and shared his satisfaction with small successes.He tells the story of the Woodpecker's resurrection with a style and wit that is down to earth; none of the ""holier than thou"" point of view that's found in so many other books on tractor restoration. This book is not a technical manual, and doesn't pretend to be. It's the simple, real life story of one man's victory over a piece of broken down junk.I found it be very enjoyable reading, and would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the lighter side of life."
4,A lovely book,"I bought this book years ago and foolishly gave it away. I recently repurchased it and am glad to have it back. I give it four stars instead of five because I figure five stars should be reserved for John James Audubon.For the most part I like the older edition (ISBN 0-03-021026-7) better. It is printed on yellowish paper with darkened edges, purposely made to look a bit aged. The colors are darker and the detail on the illustrations shows up better. But this 2001 edition has its good points too. It's printed on pure white paper so even though some of the pictures look a little washed out, the colors look clearer and brighter, not so muddy. So some people might prefer this new edition.There's a biography of Edith Holden, out of print, that I'd be interested to read. (Edwardian Lady: The Story of Edith Holden, by Ina Taylor.)"
2,should have spent the time on their own stuff,"just because you dig face to face doesnt mean youll like this. i rushed out to get it the day it came out and was rather dissapointed. i wasnt excepting the world from a cover disc... but hey, it is face to face. anyway, they cover cool songs, but dont cover them well. trever sounds off key in a bunch of these (hmmm check out the inxs track) and for the most part they are just plain hard to listen to. now, mind you, some are tasty like chesterfield king... but frank would be pissed about planet of sound. check this one out before you buy."
5,I hate to be the first to write this review.,"This is an over all good cover record. ""What Diffrence does it make"" Is the best song they covered in my view. I am a little biased, because My favorite band is The Smiths. This is a good record. Really polished and clean. I just wanted a little more from Face To Face. This is a really good cover record."
3,Disappointing.,"I remember I was really excited about this disc before it was released--I adore Face to Face--but it turned out to be pretty disappointing. Just not impressive in any way, shape or form. There are a couple of gems, the Sunny Side of the Street cover is good, and I enjoyed The KKK Took My Baby Away, but overall, this is among the worst cover albums I've ever heard, and definitely the worst Face to Face album."
4,Indy rock that computes.,"Listening to ""Dasnotcompute"" is like being bludgeoned repeatedly with a wet rubber hose; the vocals are strained and intense despite being borderline whiny, and the rhythm section solidly pounds time to each tune. This is not a bad thing, however. The sinewy edge to the vocals make them very listenable, and the fact that the rhythm section is actually busting @$$ for this record is also a plus. It's essentially a dark and twisted bass-heavy rock record with definite punk influences. The keyboards add a mysterious touch on ""Breathe, Breathe"" and overall it's different enough that I would actually pay $12 for it at the band's merch tent. The band is: David Fransson, Per Stalberg, Hakan Johansson, and Jonas Gustafsson. Check out their webpage at www.divisionoflauralee.com - Brett Lemke"
3,Good Value,I bought them for my little sister's bike. They seem to work fine and they were very inexpensive.
3,They work but....,"These brakes work well but they are manufactured quite cheaply. Of the 4 brake pads I bought, 3 didn't have the rubber seated all the way into the metal housing. It doesn't affect their performance but it is a cause for concern.When I replace these pads I'll put a couple more bucks into them and get some that don't have defects."
5,Great reminder of what a talented vocalist can do.,"This is a nastalgic pick for me. I love Belefonte and remember listening to my moms LP's on an old RCA HI-FI. The Negro Gospel spirituals presented on this cd will inspire anyone. It is presented by a talented group of musicians and is quite unusual (at least to my knowledge). ""Ezekiel"" is my favorite but Belefonte puts more than enough emotion in all of the rest to really make you pause and think. Most of these songs were inspired by the experiences of slaves and the emotion comes through eloquently. This cd will not be for everyone but I love it."
5,Wonderful!,"I have been a fan of Harry Belafonte since I was a young child and he was just becoming popular in the 1950's. I have had the pleasure of hearing him perform on three occasions and to speak twice. I have most of his albums, but not this one until today. Great sound quality, songs and interpretations of classic spirituals. Most of the tracks are not on any of the other CD's. And, if you like Belafonte and want to learn more about the civil rights movement and have not read his memoir, My Song, published in the fall of 2011, I highly recommend that as well."
3,"good bread, really hard to remove from pan","This is my second bread maker, an upgrade to a larger size. I have to date been very pleased with the bread quality, the flavor is great too. My only critcism of this appliance, I really hope Zojirushi take note, is that the bread is extremely difficult to remove from the pan without tearing the bread. I have to twist the movable metal pieces underneath the pan then shake, hoping that the baked bread does not rip at the base."
5,busy moms take note,"This breadmaker is fabulous! We upgraded from an old Dak machine. If you have one of those old Dak machines that makes the circular bread, throw it out the window and get one of these right away. This machine makes a huge loaf (one that is actually shaped like bread). The controls are easy to understand and the bread turns out great. Now everybody can wake up to fresh bread!"
2,OK machine but watch out for the warranty,"We have used this machine about 3X per week for 7 months, when the paddles started leaking oil from around the seals; in addition to this, the paddles were scraping the bottom of the pan and wearing off the nonstick coating. We sent the pan to the authorized warranty service center; they say that this is not a manufacturing defect because the pan is ""bent"", and that we can buy a new pan for about [money], and new paddles at about [money] apiece. Let me say that we have never dropped the pan and have always been very careful with it, so I believe that if the pan is ""bent"", it came that way and therefore is a manufacturing defect. So much for the one year warranty.Until this point, we have been fairly happy with the machine. We like the horizontal loaf and the nice dough that we can get for homemade bread. The machine is extremely noisy, however. If I can find a comparable replacement, I will buy something else."
3,Disappointed,"I just bought a new Zo and although it works well and makes good bread, I am unhappy with one of it's features. The bread sticks in the pan every time I bake, and by the time I pry it out, the loaf is pushed out of shape. This difficulty in removing the bread is very aggravating! I called the customer service twice and received the same answer - let it sit for 20 minutes until it softens. That's not what you're supposed to do with just baked bread. The instructional booklet says to be sure to take it out at once, so it won't get soggy. People I know who have other brands do not have this trouble. Maybe I just got a defective pan."
2,new one not as good as the old one,the new Zojirushi (horizontal) is not as good as the old vertical one in my opinion. the instructions are not very good and there are very few recipes included. So far other recipes I have used have not worked very well. I wish I could return it and use my old one. Maybe I need some help.
2,Crust control not working,"I did my homework and figured I knew which machine to buy. I have had my machine for about 1 month and have attempted quite a few loaves of bread. I have found that no matter which crust selection (light, med or dark) I choose, the crust is invariable too light and almost not done on top. I have tried different bread recipes and used the troubleshooting section in the book to no avail. I called customer service and was told to leave the loaf in the machine for 10 minutes longer after the final beep sounds even though the book says the the loaf is best removed right after the signal. I am not happy with the results. For what I payed for this machine, the crust control should work! I will attempt to contact customer service again and see what they will do. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this as the representative that I spoke with didn't seem surprised and had obviously heard this before.Kathleen Banks"
2,Get the Panasonic one instead!!,"The good thing about the ZO is that you get to see what's going on while it makes your bread through the glass window, and it displays the current process (rising, baking, etc.) on the digital display. I was however disappointed by the quality of the bread. The crust control does not work at all; no matter which setting you use, you get dard crust on the side & bottom and barely light crust on the top. The bread doesn't taste that great either. Anyways, I returned it and got the Panasonic one instead. It's great! The quality of the bread is way better. Panasonic rules!!"
5,Perfect kitchen companion - already 1 year in use,"This is one of the best buys I've made here, at amazon.com. Great bread baking machine! I haven't used the included book of recepies though as I bought Beth Hensperger's ""Bread Machine Cookbook"" at the same time. And every single recepie worked perfectly! Now I never buy bread at the store.On the downsides: sometimes it is tricky to get the bread out of the pan if you make just 1.5 lb loaf - then the weight of bread might not be enough to easily break the crust around the kneading blades. Then some rigorous shaking is required! :)After a year of CONSTANT use, the non-stick surface is sratched off in some places, but not much, and again - I am using it very-very extensively.All in all, stronlgy recommend!"
4,Great Machine,"This is our second bread machine. The first one made the vertical loaves which we didn't like. This one makes traditional style loaves and we like it better. Have made several loaves and it is just fine, but the top crust is always so light in color even though setting it to medium crust. ... Made a pound cake and strawberry jam which came out great but the jam needed a little more sugar. Wish there was a recipe for banana bread. Other machine had one but we lost the recipe book. Would definitely recommend this machine. ..."
3,Could use some improvement.,"This breadmaker was fairly decent until one of the pan's metal mixers was misplaced, now it's fairly useless. Finding a replacement part was a chore. The machine does make the bread nicely, but the pan smells strange when heated (metallic smell, which attaches itself slightly to the bread), and depending on the type of bread, it can be fairly difficult to remove from the pan without destroying the bottom of the bread. You also end up with two rather large holes from the metal mixers in the bottom of the pan."
1,"Good Product, Bad company, Don't buy it!","I bought this Breadmaker and it works fine. But recently I had a problem. I have called ""Customer Service"" twice. Their call volumes are ""extreamly high"" so all I can do is leave a message. They have not returned my call. They have no web site or e-mail address that I can find. So now I have a useless breadmaker on my counter while they have my money. Don't give them yours, until they learn the meaning of ""customer service."""
2,Wheres my teflon?,"After 6 months of intermittent use the lining and the paddles showed distinct signs of peeling, (the first pan I had actually peeled signiicantly after the first use, that was replaced quickly by the manufacturer), now at 2 yrs of age the pan is unusable, and the replacement price of paddles and pan is almost the same price as the discounted machine. I wouldn't buy another of this brand, I do like the shape of the loaf though."
2,Doesn't Work,"I bought this bread maker last December, and it worked fine for a while, but after about six months of once-a-week use, it doesn't work any more. I don't know what to do about it. Is there a warranty?"
1,I hate it.,"I am a veteran of bread machines, using them for about 10 years. I was loored by the horisontal loaf and good reviews, but the Zojirushi is the worst I had. The bread itself is nice, if you can take it out from the pan, which is almost impossible. I wish I had kept the box , so that I could return it, but I did not. So I am simply going to put it in the garbage bin and get a new one. Not a Zojirushi."
1,Wish that I could trade it in,"Unless I got a lemon, this machine consistantly turns out bread that is course, tough, and very thick hard crusted. Recipes are not forgiving. No adjusting of controls seems to help. Once tried blackberry jam. Results: Syrup with seeds! I used to own a WEL-BILT and it was a very forgiving unit. Mess up a recipe, and you still got acceptable bread."
2,Annoying wait for the warmup,"I own both this machine and the Breadman Ultimate. They both are great at baking bread and are very versatile. The Zojirushi, however, has a built-in 30 minute warmup for every bread cycle. My breads don't turn out any better in this machine, but it does take a lot longer, and the wait is frustrating. I wish I would have known about this before I purchased it. True, you can create a program, but that's not something I want to do each time I bake bread."
1,Disappointment,"I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the Zojirushi Breadmachine. It came highly recommended. However, my experience was quite different. My first loaf of bread was perfect, but subsequent loaves did not get kneaded all the way through. In fact, each loaf looked worse. I returned the machine after only a couple of weeks. Too bad!..."
4,Zojirushi makes breakfast,"This bread machine comes with a pamplet that includes many delicious recipes. I adore the cinnamon raisin bread and adding sweet goodies into my bread mix for breakfast. If it is done right, the loaf will taste very good. Prepared mixes from the grocery store are not as good as if you mix the ingredients together yourself. I recommend sifting store-bought mixes first. Sometimes the loafs come out looking like they could have used a little more mixing, and may be a little uneven. For the money and the time I have saved, this machine is the next best thing to home made bread. My Zojirushi makes breakfast!"
1,Zojirushi: Poor workmanship,"We purchased a Zojirushi BBCC-V20 Home Bakery Traditional Breadmaker. After 6 loaves of bread, one of the paddles stopped turning due to an internal problem in the motor. We returned the breadmaker ... for a free replacement. The replacement machine started making loud clanking noises after the third loaf of bread. I can understand that we might get one defective machine, but two in a row makes me think the company has a serious problem with quality control. We returned the second machine for a refund and will not purchase this or any other Zojirushi product again."
3,"Great bread, easy to use--but it died after 2 years!","I've used my machine at least once a week for two years, but the last few times I've baked bread, I noticed it wasn't rising as well as it should. Changed yeast. Didn't help. Then last week I made a banana breakfast loaf and noticed, after 11/2 hours, that it was still gooey! The heating element had died. And of course the machine is out of warranty.When I called a small appliance repair shop, I was told to go to Costco and buy a new one, that it would be cheaper than replacing the element. So I did. For less than $50--but not a Zojirushi. If I'm going to have to replace a machine, I'd rather replace a $50 one than a $200 one.I agree with the comments about the kneading paddles--they DO stick and the loaf sometimes was hard to remove. But we ate great bread, and are continuing to do so!"
2,Disappointed,"This is my second ""Z"" machine. My first, I wore out making an average of one loaf of bread a day for the past 10 years. Almost always had excellent results. Am disappointed in this new one as it is extremely noisey and the loaf size is very inconsistent -- even when using the same recipe from the book. Most of the time, the bread is higher on one end than the other.On the positive side: bread is easier to toast. Slices from the old machine (verticle loaf) didn't fit most toasters. This bread does -- especially when you toast from the 'short' end.All in all, I'm not sure I'd have spent the money on this except that I had had good experience with the verticle model. Heard too many horror stories about other machines 'wondering' when kneading to try something else.Also find it frustrating that there is no direct website to Zojirushi Corp."
2,Disappointed with the ultimate breadmaker,"I have gone through 3 less [spendy] breadmakers over the last 5 years. A year ago I thought I would go for the better highly recommended Zojirushi. It coast twice the typical maker. The old addage ""You get what you pay for"" seems to hold true for all but breadmakers. Even though I had never heard of this brand, it had all the ammenities that I wanted. After only using it a dozen times or more, the last 6 attempts eneded in failure. The bread will not rise. I have tried using various yeasts and recipes and still the bread will not rise. Mecanically, all the parts are holding up except for this problem. I will attempt to get some satisfation from the company's service center."
1,Poor Reliability,"After using this machine occasionally for two years, all of the bread fell and was a solid mess after baking. The dough would rise to the top of the machine and then fall. This happened with every recipe and variety. Zojirushi was not help. They stated if the machine was two years old, to take it in for repair. I took it in for repair and am told the electronic panel will have to be replaced for a cost of $115.00. I did not pay much more than that for the machine. I did not get my money's worth from this breadmaker. It's sad when it costs as much to repair a product as the original cost. Are these machines only good for two years?"
2,A Very Short Life For a Breadmaker,"This is such a disappointment- this machine is so wonderful at first, it makes fantastic bread and other goodies. It made homemade pizza a breeze. I just loved it- but within weeks, the paddles started to peel and rust, despite meticulous cleaning and drying. I returned the first machine, but the second one had the same problem. And now, sixteen months later- my machine is dead. It just stopped working, and of course the warranty is up. So now I am faced with a choice- do I try this machine again, despite it's expense? Or do I attempt to find another machine that can do all that this one promises? I am hoping to find a different machine with a longer life, though I'm not sure any of them out there are as great as this one is in it's first few months."
3,"Good, but not great","The ZO is a good machine, but not a great one. The ZO is my second bread machine, I had an Oster before it. I bought the ZO because a good friend has one and I was impressed with its quietness and speed. The ZO is much quieter AND faster than the cheaper Oster was, but I'm not impressed with the quality of this expensive machine. The breadpan and the blades are losing their non-stick coating and seem to be easily damaged, a disappointment since the ZO was at least twice the price of the Oster. I, too, have trouble removing the bread from the pan. The crust is often too dark and thick for my liking and you cannot adjust the crust settings when using the whole wheat options. But I do like the horizontal loaf shape and the fact you can have a hot loaf of bread in about 2 hours. This is a good bread machine and anyone buying it will probably like it. However, if all you are going to do is make bread dough with it, you'd be better off with a bread mixer, like the KitchenAid."
1,A big disappointment,"This is my second bread machine...I had a Panasonic vertical loaf and wanted a horizontal loaf. Read the reviews, bought the ZO. Big mistake. As with other folks, the clamp on the right side broke. Could not get Zojirushi's Customer Service to return my calls. Called an authorized dealer, paid $20 to get the whole bottom part when I just needed the clamp. Replaced the clamp and thought that would solve my largest problem, which is that the loaves never come out even, always lower on one side. Also, sometimes the loaf is coarse and dense, other times it is perfect, except lower on one side. I have tried it in various locations throughout my kitchen and the results are never the same. Very inconsistent. I have never gotten a perfect loaf with a recipe other than the basic loaf from the book. Very limiting. Will never buy another Zojirushi product of any kind."
2,Mechanical problems,"This is the second review I have posted for this product. The first was shortly after I received it and was complimentary. I do like the bread this machine turns out, but this expensive a machine should last more than 15 months. I had initial problems with the pan clips and now, after the warranty has expired, one of the paddles has quit working. After reading the other reviews, I suspect there is a problem with a belt. I am not going to return the machine. I can buy another, less expensive, brand for the postage cost. If my husband can't fix the Zo, I will buy a cheaper one. This expensive a machine should last for years!"
2,a big disappointment,"I was desperate for a new breadmaker when our local Great Harvest Bakery closed down (*sniff*). This breadmaker has been a huge disappointment for me. The bread is substantially worse than the last breadmaker I owned (an old DAK). It comes out with the crust too hard and all the flavor baked out of the bread. There does not seem to be an adjustment for crust darkness for the wheat bread setting, the setting I use the most. I tried all the standard ingredients plus a variety of specialty flours to get a good tasting loaf, all with disappointing results. The breadmaker also seems to really struggle with bread recipes from other breadmaker cookbooks--rarely working on the first try. (There is a handy adjustment chart in the instructions.)The one good part--The breadmaker does make pretty good bread if you use it to make the dough and then bake in your own oven."
1,bad bread machine,"I hate this machine. We stopped making bread because of it. (We made thousands of loaves on our old Regal, bought in 1988, lasted for 15 years.) I have to bite the bullet and buy something else. Who wants to take this Zoji off my hands? And what do I buy, with all these great reviews for a machine I am going to dump?"
3,"LIKE IT VERY WELL, AS BEFORE YOU CAN BEAT ONE.","LIKE IT A LOT, BUT I'M MISSING ONE SPOON PLEASE SENDTHISTOO ME.."
1,Calibration is the key - a chick magnet,"I bought a Zoj V20, and, since it works great, I give it five stars. I bought one for a friend, and, since she liked making bread by hand, for her, I would rate it one star.Conclusion: any piece of machinery has pluses and minuses, even a simple egg timer takes practice before you can calibrate it and know how to use it just right. And you cannot beat making bread, yogurt, beer manually by hand from scratch.Really this is a chick magnet type piece of equipment, to show, if you are a bachelor, that you have the inclination to eat healthy."
1,"Good Product, terrible company, don't buy it",I have a simple problem with my breadmaker so it has been a useless hunk sitting on my counter for months.This company offers the poorest excuse for service I've encountered in years. They treat me like I have some nerve expecting them to send a replacement part. I asked to speak with a manager and was told that managers do not speak to customers. Don't buy from them because if you have a problem you will regret it.
5,a healthy and reliable help in the kitchen,"I purchased the Zojirushi Bread Machine amost a year ago. I bake bread approximately 3-4 times a week. My kids love it and complain if there isn't fresh bread in the morning. A big difference from store bought.The first machine that I received was defective. Only one paddle worked. I emailed Amazon and they immediately sent me a return sticker so that I could ship it back to them at their cost. I had a new machine within a few days.The new machine works like a dream. I am extremely happy with this product. And, I am confident that help is available through Amazon if I have a problem."
5,This is a great bread machine,"I've had the Zojirushi BBCC-V20 Home Bakery Traditional Breadmaker now for about a month and have been baking about three loaves a week. It's a terrific machine, I havent had any problems with it. The bread is well mixed and well cooked. Some people complained that the mixing blades stayed in the bread when they took the bread out or that they had trouble getting the bread out of the pan. For me, the mixing blades only stayed in once (a loaf of sourdough) and I only had difficulty getting the bread out of the pan once(the same loaf of sourdough, so I think it was the bread not the machine)and all I had to do was pry it out with a rubber spatula. I have no regrets about buying this breadmaker and would recomend it highly for anyone wanting a reliable kitchen tool."
1,Poor quality- No response from manufacturer.,"I am very disappointed with the Z0 V-20. I purchased the unit approximately 18 months ago. I made bread about once a week, except for a 2 month period when we moved to another home. The bread maker did an excellent job of making bread, however the gear box was extremely noisy during the mixing process. The main problem was the bread pan and blades. The coating on the blades came off and the blades did not fit snuggly on the drive spindle. The bread pan began to leak about 6 months ago and recently the blades were scraping metal off the bottom of the pan. Discovered the pan was warped!! Sent a message to the Service Center in Commerce, CA. No response!!"
2,"Great beginning, but....","Like many other reviews, my Zojirushi started out being perfect, but within six months the paddles began to rub on the bottom of the bucket, wearing off the teflon. After about two years of moderate use, the machine's lubricant leaks into the dough around the paddles (I believe it is food grade lubricant, but who wants bluish-grey bread?). The paddles have worn the bucket surface down to bare metal. I went through the regular channels with the company, but got only an email back with prices for new bucket and paddles - .... This may have been a particular group or run of machines - but they aren't worth the money if it only lasts two years!"
5,Fun Breadmaker,"If you don't mind digging out the paddles occasionally, this is a super product. Easy to use, great choices, reminder beeps to add ingredients, viewing window, warm setting, and super tasting homemade bread is the best part. I love the crust settings for light, medium, or dark. The accompanying instructional cookbook is extremely helpful. This breadmaker is great for loaf cakes and jams as well. The two paddles work well to knead the bread and this unit is so easy to clean. My other breadmaker wasn't nearly this much fun to use and the quality of bread wasn't as good either. At 75, I've made bread a long time and used a lot of different methods, this one's a winner."
2,"Nice balance, sticks considerably","The design of this pan is great however I am disappointed with its stick resistant qualities. Perhaps I am not using it correctly, but after taking the meat to room temperature before cooking, the meat still stick to the bottom of the pan and had to be scraped."
2,Don't waste your money,"I purchased one of these new and improved pans expecting the best of both worlds. What I found is that the pan is not non stick so omelets etc... still require a non stick pan unless you want to do some series scrubbing and as for searing and clean up the new ""ONE"" series performs no better than my trusty plain hard anodized pans for cooking or cleanup.Save your money and get commerical nonstick for those items you need non stick for or regualar hard anodized for steming, pasta and side dishes (my hard anodized stick less than the new ""ONE"" series) you'll get more for your money!"
4,It's the right size and I wanted to try Calphalon One,"I got it because it's the right size, the least expensive in the Calphalon One line and I wanted to try Calphalon One. After using it once, I'll stick to Circulon. It heats up nicely and seems like it would be a good pan for searing. Circulon pans are much easier to clean though. Since I like to cook stuff like soups, casseroles, rice dishes and pasta dishes, that is, dishes that simmer over a low heat for a long time, the Circulon pots suit me better. If I give this Calphalon One pan four stars, I have to give my Circulon pans a five star."
3,I like the flag but this was a let down,"The flag is alright and the material seems pretty good.1. The suction cup didn't even work so I had to cut it off.2. The flag was poorly made and has extra ""flag"" on the corners so I have to take scissors and make it even3. No product is perfect, I know but the yellow pieces looked like they were already old and sticking to each other on few parts..."
2,Fast shipping .... Not the best quality,The flag was of course very nice. I got it really fast but when I took it out one of the strings on top was broken :( I still have it but it's hard to fix.
2,Leftover Disco,"I was looking for music for relaxing to put into trance. This puts you in a foot stomping, finger tapping, dancing trance. Music all sounds like leftover disco music. Not what I was looking for. Guess I'll check into Reiki music. I got no use for this type of music."
4,Great work out songs,I usually listen to the fast passed songs for working out witch are great motivators. If you love trance then I would recommend this album.
3,not as good as Deep Trance,"First, the one difference between this CD compilation and the Deep Trance compilation is that the tracks on this one are not blended together - there are gaps between them. But most of the music on the first disc are pretty good.Disc 1 -- overall pretty good; I'd rate it an 8 out of 10Disc 2 -- absolutely horrible; the cover versions of ""the sun always shines on TV"" and ""waterloo"" are enough to make any fan of those songs want to retch. This disc rates a 2 out of 10.If you're trying to decide whether to buy this or the Deep Trance CD, the Deep Trance compilation is way better."
3,"Lovely writing, so so plot","I loved the author's writing style, the description of place, of character, the dialogue; the author obviously has skill, and produced a work that feels simple, honest and heartfelt.However, I thought the character development needed work and the plot was lame. The characters started out well drawn and believable. I loved the cranky main character-he reminded me so much of my grandfather-and many of the supporting characters had a spark of life as well, but the love interest felt flat and one dimensional to me. There's hardly any build up to them falling in love and into bed. The ""mystery"" is also weak, as it's obvious who the bad guys are, and they're brought to justice ""off screen"" as it were.For me, this book fell into that nebulous genre of ""the author has a point to make"", but the writing was so strong, and the main character so relatable, that I enjoyed the story despite what I view as a few large flaws."
2,black and white,"It's a nice toilet seat. We have a black and white themed bathroom, so this seat works out ok for us, but it is a bit unusual. It is black wood, but all of the plastic is white. I'd have been happier with all black, and I suspect just about everybody else would be too.Update: I've been meaning to update this review for a while now. A few weeks after installing it, a small piece of paint fell off. I can't imagine why, but now there is a small chip missing in the black paint. For the money, the paint should have lasted for years without a chip, but having a piece chip off when nothing fell on it to chip it away. I'm very disappointed with this product."
5,Little Manhattan...,"Little Manhattan brought back a slew of memories for me also. This movie brought to the fore the feelings that I had had (as a pre-teen & teen), but just didn't have the voice to express my feelings to the females with whom I was enamored. Now, I didn't cry as our young man did in the DVD, but I did understand (and could relate).I wouldn't relive those days even if you paid me! I would recommend this flick to all pre-teen and teen young men as course 101 in the art of expressing one's feelings to females - but the fact is, that with the emotion that we call love, there is no 'art' to it. If you wear your heart on your sleeve, chances are it's going to be broken - be ready - if you can.To anyone that reads this - have your pre-teen and teenage sons watch this. If they say, ""That will never happen to me!"", just smile at them and say, ""If you say so..."" and leave it at that!!"
5,A bittersweet NYC love story,"This movie was a blind-buy in my case, and I have to say, I wasn't in the least bit dissapointed.The basis of the story is young ""ten-and-three-quarters"" year old Gabe who falls in love with Rosemary.The movie is wonderful. It's a love story, but it's innocent and bittersweet, which gives it it's charm. The movie is one to which everyone can relate to. Rosemary and Gabe are like our inner child, and New York City as the setting is beautiful, it gives off the ""magical place where anything can happen"" aura.The cast is also incredible.Everything fits and comes together almost perfectly. I especially liked the fact that they made Gabe the narrator and that he doesn't come off as corny, but more as a cynic as far as love and girls go (which would be understandable for his age). The movie never loses pace and I didn't once look at my watch, which is a huge plus.Overall, it's a movie I really enjoyed watching and that I'd highly recommend."
2,The video quality of DVD is not so good (or too bad),"I do love ""Little Manhattan."" I bought the DVD after watching this movie broadcasted from HBOHD. I got a totally different experience to the HBOHD version. No one should expect it's in HD quality, but it's worse than 90% of DVD I've ever bought. The quality is basically the same to the quality of a single layer (DVD-5) DVD video. If you really love this movie, I must suggest you wait for a while for another version."
5,The Big Apple of my eye,"Little Manhattan is a perfectly delightful romantic comedy that the entire family can enjoy, and could even act as a springboard for discussions between parents and kids about ""the vicissitudes of love"" (just like the movie ""American Pie"" can act as a springboard for frank discussions between parents and teens about sex).If you don't have kids, it's still a funny movie that will make you think about your own first inklings of love, requited or otherwise. In some ways, even mature adults feel and act like ten-year-olds when it comes to love. The Manhattan scenery is gorgeous. Of course, we're talking Upper West Side Manhattan, so what's not to like?I'd put Little Manhattan in my top ten of romantic comedies. The protagonists are kids, but the story isn't sappy or formulaic like many adult romantic comedies."
5,"""to live, to love to be young""","I ran across this film today and it caught my attention with the New York scenery and the Wonder Years type approach. To my surprise I was captivated by the two youngs subjects of this film and found myself like some of the other reviewers, laughing out loud, a little misty-eyed and remembering my young years growing up in NY. These 2 main characters in my opinion were very good actors and really captured the feelings they were trying to get across on screen. (I wonder if they were also from NY). I would recommend this film to any family that likes the nostalgic type films that take you back to the times of your own life. Very enjoyable film..."
4,Good movie...........,"I saw this movie on my flight to India. 'Little manhattan' resembles my story; the only difference being that my story happened in Bombay. I felt very sad after watching the ending because I have gone through it (In fact, Gabe was lucky enough to suffer heartbreak only once. I had to undergo it twice after I met my Rosemary again after 14 years).Anyways, this is a very good romantic movie and a 'must-watch' for guys who were really in love at around age 11. Can't wait to get my copy."
2,Best Thing is the Title,"Continuing my quest to see everything Roger Corman ever directed, the best thing about this obscurity is its title, opening sequence and location photography. One can appreciate the title without ever seeing the 60 minute movie itself, and the impact of Floyd Crosby's Hawaiian location photography has been greatly diminished by Alpha's poor transfer, which looks to be from a pretty good print but has been transferred to DVD with the brightness up much too high, making the few night scenes easier to watch than the many daytime shots. That leaves only the opening sequence, a suspenseful nighttime dockside robbery, nicely staged and edited with no dialogue. The rest of the film, minus Corman's usual stock company of actors or a script from ever-reliable writers like Charles B. Griffith, R. Wright Campbell, Robert Towne or Richard Matheson, is forgettable."
2,Bait and switch,"Aside from having Roger Corman's name on the cover of this film there is a picture of a wet blond just wearing only a strategically placed lei.No blonds.No She Gods.And the lei is broken.Looks like Roger was distracted by the other movie he was making at the same time ""Thunder Over Hawaii.""The basic story is bad guy (who gets into killing and gunrunning) flees authorities with his brothers help. A storm arises and they get shipwrecked on a mysterious island with native girls, sharks, pearls, and a nasty old woman.So who gets the native girls, sharks, pearls, or worse yet the nasty old woman?"
2,Tropical Sleeping Pill...,"Sounds like a good movie about girls on the beach, right? Well, it's okay in the babe department, but lacks any real excitement. Two brothers get shipwrecked on an island full of beautiful young pearl-diving lasses, controlled by an old woman with a permanent scowl. Our he-man heroes change into floral mini-skirts and the game is on! There are a couple of sharks swimming around at times, but not enough to cause any true fright or tension. SGOSR is not one of Corman's stellar moments! Watch it as a double bill with SWAMP WOMEN for added drowsiness..."
2,Sharks but No She Gods,"Typical Corman schlock, but kinda fun in its own bad way. I liked the totally evil dark brother and the totally good Tab-Hunterish blond brother and how cleverly they managed to turn sarongs into tight shorts. Funny when they are out on some rocks on the shore and you can hardly hear anything over the sound of the waves. I liked the lame-ass shark, too...no Jaws here! Anyway, I stayed awake. Got this as part of the 50 Classic Sci-Fi movies...it's a boxed set worth getting if you like this stuff."
5,expiration dated,can i know what the expiration date of this product before i buy them? i can find it on the information given. please help me. i really want to know
4,Good Intro to the world of Techno and House Music,I first heard the album about 7 Yrs. ago. and I loved it from the very start. All of the songs are my favorite. I used to listen to it in the mornings to wake me up and get me started for the day. I think this is a good CD to introduce yourself to Techno Music. Enjoy!
2,Entry level baroque,Nice cheap way to get into Baroque music. Unfortunately it's not the best recording you can get but it should be adequate enough for a non-audiophile. I've been unable to bring myself to listening to it again since I noticed that someone coughs in the background (very noticeably) during Handel's Messiah. Wonder if this is an outtakes CD.
5,EASY TO PLAY,THIS HARMONICA IS A STEP OR TWO ABOVE MANY WITH EASE OF PLAY WITH THE DOUBLE HOLES. THE SOUND IT PRODUCES EXCEEDS MY EXPECTATION. THE CURVED SHAPE MAKES IT VERY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD AND PLAY.
5,a very nice Christmas present,"It was for my cousin, he loves the harmonics and is very happy with this product. is an excellent brand and the whole buying process was perfect"
3,track list,"tracks on this remixes are:Step On (Remix '91)1 Remix - Steve Osborne 4:262 Step On (Stuff It In Mix)Remix - Paul Oakenfold & Steve Osborne 5:553 Loose Fit (12"" Inch Version) Remix - Paul Oakenfold & Steve Osborne 6:274 Groovy Afro (Lorimer 12"") Remix - Peter Lorimer 7:32"
3,"Wears out, tears easily","I've had silk boxers before and they didn't wear out as fast as these, they are comfortable but their lifespan will be short... especially if you wear them as daily wear boxers, they really should only be worn at night to sleep in perhaps because daily life you move around a lot and will wear these out pretty fast... unless you move very slowly and carefully. They seem tight on the waste compared to other boxers I own... It seems like it is a size too small on the waste."
2,Runs Small,"My husband has worn L and XL. I purchased a pair of these in the XL but he said they were snug. They looked nice but they obviously run small and since they don't have an XXL, I will have to keep looking. Very disappointed."
4,A duet by Warwick and Barry Gibb,"The songs of this album are sang by D. Warwick and written by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees. It is a very nice album. It is a must have if you are a Bee Gees/Barry Gibb fan, as well."
3,Not the Best,"The Heartbreaker album can't count as one of the best Dionne Warwick CDs, but this one includes the title song Heartbraker which is written by the Bee Gees. It's a very good sound, and Dionne put a lot of emotion into it. Other songs sounds ok, but not so good as the previous albums of Dionne Warwick. Should do better."
4,Nice! FAST!,"We ordered Sun night, before a holiday and received the book by Thursday morning. Talk about swift! Great service =)"
5,So far... I love it!,"I love this product. It took me 15 mins to put together with NO TOOLS! It is sturdy and dispite the look of it, the stroller is pretty lightweight and easy to move. Does NOT weigh a million pounds.The fabric seems a bit cheap. Nothing really wrong with it just not the softest frabic you have ever felt. BIG PROBLEM... matching diaperbag. This system does not have a matching diaper bag. frustrating to find a diaper bag that goes along with this system.Carseat? Well it's a Snug Ride. Easy to place in the car easy to snap off its base. Ex-sturdy. No fuss. VERY HAPPY."
2,This stroller is OK at best,Stroller is big when folded up and there are better options on the market. Keep shopping.
4,fun,"This movie is a little twisted, but we enjoy it. I dislike Pee Wee Hermon's character the most, just don't enjoy that humor but overall the movie is fun and the family loves it."
4,My baby liked it,"My little one liked this and would eat it up without any issues. It does have all the vegetables. I think I could do the same in a blender, but it was just convenient especially when we were travelling. She would not create any fuss and actually showed excitement when I would open up the packet."
3,"He loves sweet potatos, but this one is runny","I don't know if its the corn, but this sweet potato is runny. The other ones from Gerber with sweet potato's are not. I prefer the solid food to be thicker."
1,Rated low because product & replacement arrived broken,"I cant tell you how the product worked because it and the replacement arrived with the interior glass broken. It was not packaged properly, and even tho it was noted that was the reason for the first return, they packed the replacement the same way, and it arrived shattered as well. I wont order it again."
4,Amazon quickly corrects problem,"On Monday, I received and opened the Zojinushi 3-Liter Airpot that I ordered from Amazon.com. Unfortunately,the glass insulation was broken into little pieces. I went on line and followed the easy to use return instructions asking Amazon.com to send a replacement. By return email later the same day I received confirmation that a new one would be sent out. Today is Wednesday, two days later, and the replacement has arrived. This time the glass insulation is just fine. The airpot works fine. I am really pleased and impressed how well and quickly Amazon.com took care of this problem."
3,Very Fragile,"Although the product itself is great, the glass inner-lining is extraordinarily fragile. One bump & it shattered into millions of pieces. Had to purchase a replacement within one day."
4,Great thermos - keeps everything hot over 24+ hours,"Bought this a couple of weeks back, and I am very happy overall. Having gone through several thermos with lackluster performance, I was hoping this one would be better. I was surprised and very pleased. With a three liter capacity there's plenty of water to go around now.Pros:1. Sturdy construction, very well put together,2. Keep contents hot over 24+ hours.3. Easy to clean stainless steel exterior.Cons.1. Glass thermos interior, may not be suitable for rough handling.2. Plastic water recovery pipe, which will remain immersed in the hot water. I fixed this by getting an 8 inch length of copper tube, of 3/8 inch diameter, and replaced the plastic pipe with it.I would give this 4 stars, and point 2 on the Cons list, is what kept it from getting a full 5. I would have thought that Zojirushi would have understood that plastic and hot water don't do well together."
1,No More,Item was returned. When it arrived the inside glass was shattered.This is the second Zojirushi Airpot I have bought with a shattered inside bottle. Something must be wrong with the design!Also unable to buy replacement for the broken part.I will not buy anymore.
5,Works great,"Got this for my wife for christmas. She loved it, we had family over for christmas dinner and it work out great."
5,"Zojirushi Supreme 3-Liter Airpot, Brushed Stainless Steel","Arrived brand new. Purchase was simple and product arrived on time. Love, love, LOVE this air pot!"
5,A Good Book,I enjoyed this novel. The writing was very fresh and intelligent. I believe that this is a story that many can identify with. I read the book in the time frame of a few days. It was just so compelling. Keep Achieving!
4,A Must Read,Wow this book was really great. Anderson did an excellent job of putting this story together. When is the MOVIE coming out???
4,Funny and well written,"I love this book! The author has such style! His writing is so creative and vivid. It's easy to read yet displays his clever mastery of the English language. It has a pleasant dose of humor at all the right times. It's a great book for young adults, especially recent college grads. Kudos Robert!"
1,DVD has outdated Information on Argenitna,"This DVD is dated as a 2004 release and maybe the DVD was released then but the video was defintely filmed at least five years earlier.The video is not very helpful and full of false information about the country, particularly the cost of traveling. Justine Shapiro states that it is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE to travel in Argenitna. It was back then when the video was made, mostly in 1997, but now after the devaluation in 2001 Argentina is considered one of the most inexpensive travel destination in the world.It was shot in 2004 and contains the latest information for tourists, such as the CURRENT price of hotels, food, etc.If you are interested in visiting Argentina and really want to know how it is NOW I recommend you consider the ""Best of Buenos Aires"" video on Amazon."
1,too gorey for average travelers,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my parents, hoping to entice them to visit my us after we move to Argentina this summer. I was surprised when they told me that the show had completely turned their stomachs with vivid portrayals of killing and gutting a cow, ripping off it's hide and opening the stomach to show what's inside. The host also brands a cow, and you hear it moaning as you watch her, in shock, asking herself WHY she had ever agreed to do such a thing. I think this would be a fine video to watch for ""documentary"" entertainment, but if you are trying to convince the average 70 year old traveler (or anyone who is not gung-ho on livestock) to go to Argentina for a holiday, this is NOT the DVD to choose! We're going to look for another, more ""travel-friendly"" program to show to the rest of the family instead."
2,before 2001!,"This video was made before 2001 and the economic crash, so they keep talking about how expensive it all is. Not up to date at all. They need to make a new one. However, they do highlight great things to do."
3,Globe Trekker:Argentina,I am in love with Iguazu Falls and the photo on the cover led me to think the video would devote some time to the falls. Only seconds were on the falls but I did enjoy other parts of the video which covered places I hadn't been.
4,A good clean story,"The other reviewers are right. Compton writes a good clean story, and this is no exception. It's unfortunate that Compton died when he did, because I antipated a lot more from him. Fortunately, we have now Kirby Jonas, whom critics call the New Louis L'Amour. His books are clean, not graphically violent, and the swearing is minimal. Louis L'AMour would be proud to see his name applied to Kirby Jonas. If you read L'Amour, COmpton, and Jonas, you can't go wrong!"
4,This book is excellent for inspiration in your faith & Mary.,"This book is easy to read and is put together extremely well. I read it in a matter of days and my faith life has been intensified 100 fold since. None of the messages from Our Mother, during these reported apparitions condradict Church teaching or other confirmed apparitions. From what I could tell, it is the truth. Even if you don't believe that the apparitions are real, it is inspirational and intense."
5,Great Movie,as long as i remember this movie ive always loved it.i was born in 1982 so i aint that old but now im 22 and i still love this movie but now i have a child of my own and i'm goin 2 pass it down to her .hope u order this video u wont b disappointed!!!!!!!
2,just okay,"The movie came pretty promptly, but the condition, was just okay. I cannot rememebr if it was new or used, but sometimes i have problems playing it in my vcr.. And other times its okay.. I think i will have to order another at some point though."
3,Glass Liner,"We would suggest that this product be advertised specifically as having a ""glass liner"". We were looking for an altogether stainless steel carafe and thought we were getting one. Based on favorable reviews of this product, we would have kept it and given it a try even though it was not what we were expecting. HOWEVER, the ""glass liner"" was shattered when we received it, presumably in shipping?? We did not want to take another chance on it and so, we simply sent it back."
5,Fabulous thermal bottle,"I didn't want to keep my thermos plugged in 24 hours a day and use up electricity, and I didn't want my hot water to be soaking in with a plastic tube all day, don't know if that tube has bpa or not. My friend has a thermal bottle that she keeps plugged in and she burned herself because the outer shell gets real hot. I don't have to worry about that with Zojirushi Premium Thermal, the outside stays cool to touch and the hot water I put in it is usually consumed while still hot. The size is great, not too small but not too big. Light enough even when full for my 81 year old mom to lift to pour from. Also has a rotating base that was a bonus surprise for us but a very handy feature. I am very happy with it and got rid of my airpots and plug ins."
1,Inside of coffee pot in a million pieces!,"Not a bad looking Carafe, when it was delivered the inside of carafe was crushed, the outside was fine. I'm not sure who's fault it is, but somebody goofed."
3,push button is a pain,"This thermos is great except for the push-botton opening lid which seems to clog easily and not work efficiently. It became such a bother that we disassembled the it which is not a great solution because coffee now gets into the lid and tends to leak all over. Too bad this open/close button exisits. Otherwise, I would rate this product 5 stars because the thermos is excellent and keeps coffee hot for over 12 hours."
2,Badly Designed Carafe,"As others have noted, the design of the lid is very problematic, making it basically impossible to keep clean and eventually leading to jamming of the mechanism. That alone is a major design flaw. In addition, the design of the chamber makes pouring the coffee without spilling a challenge. When pouring the last couple of cups of coffee, you have to tip the carafe up quite a bit. This leads to coffee coming out of the top of the lid as well as the spout. If you take the lid off to pour, then you have to be really careful to watch out for the tipping point where the coffee just rushes over the lip and soaks the counter top. We hate this thing."
2,"Close, but not quite.","This carafe is attractive, holds a lot and keeps stuff hot for quite some time, but the pop-out open/close valve is faulty. It will open, but is hard to close as it sticks. The solution is to wiggle the cap a bit and the close button pops back out, but it's more hassle than it should be."
2,Sticky Open Close Mechanism,"Bought this carage in November 2007. This carafe worked wonderfully for approximately 1.5 years. After eighteen months the sping loaded open/close mechanism began to stick in the open position. It is now extremely difficult to make the open/close mechanism move from open to close. Note that the mechanism must be in the closed position in order to take the screw-off top off for cleaning purposes. This carafe's ability to maintain coffee at an extremely hot temperature for extended period is excellent. Unfortunately, the sticky open close mechanism now renders this carage as virtually useless. I would expect more than an 18-month lifespan out of a $40 carafe. Perhaps they should dump the spring loading and just go a simpled unscrew to open and tighten to close procedure. As with another comment on Amazon.com I can find no info on any type of warranty."
5,trusted stuff,"We decided to buy it when we saw that it was of the same brand as our rice cooker, since the rice cooker was really wonderful.We have used the thermos for several weeks and we have to say that we like it, we like the size, we like the quality and I especially like it because I only need to boil water once and it keeps the water hot all day--it saves us energy, electricity and water!"
2,Was shattered when it arrived.,"This item arrived, and when I opened the box, glass shards were everywhere. The glass inner lining had shattered. It was so poorly packaged and sent that it went RIGHT back to Amazon. A first for me- and I've ordered hundreds of items from Amazon."
4,Zojirushi 1-3/4 Thermal Carafe,"Zojirushi Premium Thermal 1-3/4-Liter Carafe, Brushed Stainless SteelI have been using the Carafe for about a month and have found it to be an excellent product. My wife is happy with her hot coffee, which I brew early in the morning and place it in the carafe for her later morning enjoyment. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for at least 8-10 hours; of course I do preheat it with hot tap water prior to filling it with coffee."
4,"Excellent Heat Retention, sleek, and good looking.","This insulated carafe has one of the best heat retention capacities I've ever seen in a carafe. It keeps coffee hot for almost 8 hours. It is slim; doesn't take up a lot of counter space as so many of its volume do, and is mounted on a turntable bottom, which is very useful if it is on the table where several people are using it. Its only downside; the spout is very small, which may be useful for filling tea cups, but is somewhat of a bother for filling a coffee mug as it pours slowly. Overall, it is a very good carafe and worth the money."
5,"Fresh coffee, from the first cup to the last!","I am very happy with my new Zojirushi hot coffee dispenser. My wife and I had our first cups of coffee from it today, just after its fast delivery by Amazon.Hours after the first cups, we finished off the twelve cups we had put in it: the last two cups were as hot and fresh as the first two.I look forward to having fresher coffee, savings on electricity; by not having to leave the pot on, savings on buying coffee; nothing gets wasted and fresh coffee on demand.Rick Huffman,Author of, Dreams in Blue: The Real Police."
5,Zojirushi gem,"I was looking for a carafe that would hold a 12 cup pot of coffee, my daughter who bought one from Amazontold me about it and highly recommended it. Good thing I listened to her for it truly is a jem.Now I would recommend it to anyone whom like is looking for a 12 cup carafe, and yes, it came from Amazon."
2,Too heavy,the item is too heavy even before it's filled. And I don't understand why hot milk cannot be added to the thermal bottle. Does that mean if you make coffee with milk the glass will shatter?
2,Old Hag movie,"Overall the movie was okay, good twist at the end. Bad acting and overall plot was poor. Characters were overblown, wouldn't have watched it except for a class project. It's a good movie to laugh at. Best thing was twist at the end other than that it's forgettable."
1,H2O Armband,I have gone through two of these armbands in about six months. They are made of very poor material. After a while the velcro just wont hold on to the rest of the band.I contacted H2O Audio about the problem and in so many words was told Oh Well.The junk Headphones quiet working during this six month period also.Don't waist your money on this crap.Gave it one star because I cant leave zero stars.
1,Don't Buy,"Completely useless. Expensive Seranwrap, essentially, with a big hole for the dial - but does not fit nano tightly (I made sure it was the correct generation). Does not come with headphones. I'm not going to spend $70 on waterproofing."
4,Ol Blue Eyes revisited...,Patrick Williams' writing is impeccable on this recording. It is reenforced by the power and facility of the assembled players. My only disappointment is that one track will not play.
5,Over the Top,"I've been a big band fan going back to Glenn Miller and this album beats them all. The solos, the sections playing together and the entire band are just over the top. I listen to this often and hear something different each time. Don't miss it if you're a big band enthusiast."
4,A must-have for those who love the Sinatra that swings.,"Picking up the Nelson Riddle tradition, Williams leads his powerful band in his own arrangements of twelve Sinatra classics. Each track offers a blend of the straight melody intertwined with fresh, energetic interpretations that appeal to listeners of any generation. Williams provided the arrangements for the two Duets CDs, and here he gives his band center stage, showing off their discipline as an ensemble, while giving ample time to soloists. A great recording packed with swing!"
5,Charming The Snakes,"Charming the Snakes has all the ingredients of the Great American Thriller, money, sex and murder, but not necessarily in that order. What raises it above the 'run of the mill pot-boiler' are the constants twists that never quite lead the reader where they might think the plot is going. Charles Winnickey's central anti-hero character should not be likeable, yet the author has painted a word picture of him that makes it difficult not to identify with him for much of this unusual book. It is all part of a literary mix that intrigues and often grips."
5,Wish I read this one first!,"The Case for Christmas was a much easier read than The Case for Christ. It's basically a preview to The Case for Christ without all of the overwhelming details and questions. I do wish there had been more of a focus specifically on the fact that Christ wasn't actually born on December 25th but overall, really good reading!"
3,"Read The Case For Christ, it's more thorough","Because it's so informative, I've read The Case For Christ at least three times in the past year. Now I purchased The Case For Christmas because I thought it would be different. Instead I find that I'm basically reading the same book, but in a more concise way. Most of the book is word for word the same, so if you can afford it, buy The Case For Christ and get more for your money.Also,this The Case For Christmas paperback is about half the size of the other book."
1,Journalism has changed its definition since Fox News,"Storbel keeps advertising how he is a journalist, yet he continues to ignore facts and only speak to those people who he knows will give him the answer. There isn't a search for any facts whatsoever in his latest book, just like his previous ones. It is all just a search for beliefs, with actual facts and evidence ignored."
4,Historical fact,The proof is in the research and nothing else needs to be said. Do your homework and then decide for yourself.
4,a book to support faith,"short sweet and to the point, a good book to read if you doubt the virgin birth or want more ""evidence"" to support the possibility of Christ's birth as described by the Bible."
4,Meaty!,"This is helpful for the person who has intellectual doubts about the trustworthiness of Biblical accounts, or the one who desires to know more surely why we believe what we believe. Either way, this little book buttresses belief for some, and plants the seeds of belief for others."
5,Canned Heat........Even better than what I ever thought,"This is some New Orleans/Mississippi blues at its best with a bit of southern rock thrown in!!! Canned Heat is one of the most underrated groups of all time. They are great. They were improperly labeled a group of 60s hippies, but they were much more than that. Yes, they did appear at Woodstock and maybe that is why they were never recognized as what they truly were. This CD will show you the real Canned Heat. No doubt, ""On The Road Again"" and ""Going Up The Country"" are very classic songs and actually are the songs that made me buy the CD. They have always been two of my favorite songs of all time. These should always be in everyone's top list of classic songs, but wait until you hear what else is here. This is spectacular. If you love blues, southern rock and some great music, do not miss out on Canned Heat. They got it!!!!!! Get this!!!! Now!!!!! There ain't no bad songs here............"
4,Ageing hippy?,"My 17 year old son, who was born 20 years after Woodstock bought this CD after he heard ""On the road again"" at a friend's house. The CD is great and brings back memories from the 60s and 70s"
5,canned heat,"I have looked for a very long time for this CD. I was so happy to find it on Amazon. I guess you can find ANYTHING on Amazon. It is great, great, great. Much nostalgia."
5,Great rock'n roll and blues.,"If you like bluesy rock'n roll than this cd is a must for your collection. Standout tracks ""Going Up Country"" and ""Amphetamine Annie."""
5,"Good ""best of"" album!","Wanted to buy their album, but it was ridiculously expensive so we found this for a decent price. It's got all of their hits and sounds great!"
5,Great ALL IN ONE album to start you off!,"This is a great way to start a Canned Heat collection or just improve your Blues music. Though they were the backround for Woodstock, did not realize they were so much more as a blues band that really gets it on! Rollin' and Tumblin' is always good to hear and Heat's version of Dust My Broom really rocks out. When I first heard track 8 Fried Hockey Boogie, thought I was listening to Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit in the Sky""....am I the only one who hears the almost identical intro? Never grow tired of hearing On The Road Again or Goin' Up The Country and Bullfrog Blues is fun. There are NO bad takes on this CD. This is a group of musicians who seem to really jell together in their playing and this collection from several of their albums gives you a starting point to what albums will be next on the list. Canned Heat's music does not seem dated to me but just good playing, crank up the volume, sit back and enjoy."
2,What Happened To Blind Owl's Harmonica?,"My rating is only for a downloaded mp3 track from this album: On The Road Again.Alan's vocals are fine, but there is no Harmonica soloing on the downloaded mp3.Sounds peculiar, and unsatisfying.I suppose it could work as some kind of harmonica karaoke track, but I'd rather hear Alan playing.Because of all the 5-star ratings, I'm assuming this defect is not on the CD.Perhaps a CD owner can verify this."
5,Best Heat compilation ever!,"What a great one stop collection! Has their best known songs from other compilations as well as full length Fried Hockey Boogie. A track which is a inexplicable huge ommision from the more comprehensive 2 disc ""Uncanned"" I would supplement this with ""Living with the Blues"" which has many other great songs and only one repeat from this collection and if you want even more, the great ""Hooker and Heat"" 2 disc set is the next best stop!"
5,ROCK ON !,One of my new favorite music albums. It's an awesome CD with some of the best tracks ever performed by one of the greatest blues/rock bands of the 60's. This CD arrived as described and in a timely fashion.
4,Canned Heat is Hot!,"Really a remarkable achievement from this band. Great set of songs and I just love the voice of the singer in ""On the Road again"", ""Going up the Country"", etc. Brilliant songs and sound as good today as anything I can listen to. Overall, a great compilation of songs from a band that at the very least had a great deal of musicianship among them. They deserve nothing but accolades and that is what I am hopefully infusing. I have read a little bit of the kind of S..T they went through and I admire them even more. A real testimony of the era in which they existed and evolved, party like there is no tomorrow and music with heart. Canned Heat is as Hot today as they were at their peak. One for the ages is what I say! 4 Stars for ""The Very Best of Canned Heat""."
5,great dog food,This is the best dog food out there. Our dogs skin problems have cleared beause of this holistic food.
5,Amazing Death Metal.,"This was the CD that introduced me to Soul Reaper, even before I ever discovered Dissection. Every song on this CD is a five star rating. I place these guys right up there with Vital Remains, old Morbid Angel, Suffocation and many more. They sound (to me at least) like old Morbid Angel from the Altars of Madness era, mixed with more technicality to the songs. Killer vocals and one hell of a tight band. These guys do not sound sloppy ... anywhere. Don't pass this one up. Check my review for their other CD on Amazon, Liferazer, also a five star Death Metal masterpiece. Cheers,Necrosoul."
3,fondant cutters NOT cookie cutters,"These are very small. So, if you are looking for really little cookies, these will work. If you are looking for standard cookie cutter sizes, the largest of these is a small cookie cutter. The smallest is so small, you couldn't fit it over your pinkie (unless you have a very small pinkie). They are sturdy and I did use the largest one for cookie dough because I was desperate, but it worked. Also, while the largest cutter has pointed edges for the star, the two smaller ones have rounded edges so they are barely star shaped. One good thing about the largest one is that the angles of the star points are far enough apart that your cookie dough does not get stuck in them."
3,Star cut outs,Works as advertised. The smallest on in my opinion is too small to work with but the other two are a good size. I use them to make fun shapes out of food for my kids lunches. They can also be used for fondants and cookies.
2,Disappointing Stars,"These stars were so small, I was shocked. I don't know if they will be able to be used for baking."
2,Very tiny - they have changed the name,"These were labeled as cookie cutters when I bought them, but as others stated, they are much too small for that. The largest one makes about a 1 and 1/4 to 1 and 1/2 inch cookie. The two smaller ones were no good at all. These are for pastry decoration cut outs as the package identified when I received it.They have since updated the name to ""Set of 3 Star Cut Outs"" which doesn't really make it more clear, but at least doesn't say they are cookie cutters."
5,Neat Set,"Cookie cutters nest nicely, cut cleanly. They arrived on time. A good purchase and good value! I used them to cut fondant and they did a fine job."
5,movie,We watched this movie when it first came out. I wanted my grandchildren to watch it now that they are entering their teens. They need to be aware of what really happened in history..They sure aren't getting it in school these days. Shame on us all...The pkg was great and the movies was shipped as new and arrived in new condition.
3,It pays to be talented and famous,"Such ""haiku"" - ""They make good coffee / in Oklahoma"" - not particularly haiku, not particularly interesting ... if I wrote the lines, they certainly wouldn't be published ... there are other similarly brilliant entries: ""There's Mister I-Cower- / under-My Car"" or brilliant stand-alone lines ""Whore candy"". Trip Trap leaves me unimpressed.However, the book contains a recollection of the trip by Albert Saijo, the trip as described in an unfinished work of Lew Welch, Trip Trap itself which is a collaborative effort between those two and Jack Kerouac, and finally some letters of Lew Welch to Jack Kerouac. The net result is a book that gives insight into the beat movement and into the minds of Kerouac and Welch. For those with even a slight interest in either topic, this is an interesting and informative book."
2,One To Avoid Unless You're A Real Fan,"Lew Welch and Jack Kerouac...two of my favorite writers on the road with Albert Saijo (who turns out to be a fine memoirist) right after Kerouac's roaring success with On The Road. There they are madly yapping away in front seat and back of Lew's jeepster Willy, rushing through the nights and days of innocent (well, really not so) America, and stopping once in a while to record it all in haiku. It's got to be a classic, right? Think again. Sure there are one or two good haiku to be found in the collection, and Grey Wolf Press includes enough supporting material to add context and some pith to the purchase, but this book is really for the die-hard Gotta-Have-It-All-Right-Down-To-The-Laundry-Lists-fans of beatdom. Ring of Bone, On The Road, and just about every other book written by these greats will give you more for your money."
5,"Useful, Practical, and Detailed","This is the manual that beginners are looking for to actually walk them through the process of selecting and working with Business Object Universes, Documents and Reports. It is simply written, clear, concise, inclusive and best of all actually useful when sitting down at the terminal to use Business Objects. If anything I would like to see this in Hardcover (because this is a book that will get use over and over) and that they come out with a Designer's version in the same format."
4,Good For Instructors,"My company is using this book to teach classes on BusinessObjects. It has been very convenient, because there are so many examples. It is a little expensive, which is why I gave it four stars."
3,Useful tips but poorly organized,"I got this book soon after I started working with BusinessObjects. It has a number of useful tips --- if you can find them. The way Schmidt organized the book makes it hard to find what you are looking for. Until something better comes along, I would recommend it to beginners and intermediate users (even those using Version 5) but be prepared to work to get what you need from it."
1,A little expensive,"I was hoping for something a little more user friendly than this book. As a new person to BusinessObjects I ordered this thinking that I would be getting a step by step guide. There is a lot of information in this, even with the index it is hard to know what exactly you are looking for unless you know your way around the tool already. All in all I wish I had spent my money on something more user friendly and something that can be used as a self-tutorial."
5,This is a great book.,I have read a number of thrillers but none like The First Terrorist Act. This is a definite page turner and a must for anyone who has been a fan of modern day thrillers.It reads as if you are following it on the news. You can actually SEE THE STORY unfolding.How much of it is true? How much is actually fiction? It is hard to tell. It reads as if it actually happened. That is what makes this a great book.
4,Test Drive rate,"Test Drive UnlimitedIn the long run the online play is what will keep you coming back for more. Without it, you'll get tired of the game much more quickly."
4,Cruisin down the highway...lookin for adventure..,They actually recreated Oahu to exact specs. This game is just fun to drive around and see the sites. If you haven't been to Hawaii now is the time to take this affordable trip. I gave this game a lower rating in general because the racing is actaually a little lackluster. Driving a car seems to move a little slower than usual. While recreating a Hawaiian Island they have failed create a great racing sim. I would recommend this game to others just for sheer beauty. Although if you are looking for a great racer turn head.
4,Very interesting game.,"This game is unlike any other racing game other there. The missions are very unique and challenging. The cars and landscapes are beautiful. if you want tou can simply drive around the island all day and try to get away from the cops. I enjoyed that a lot. Even though the missions are unique, they can be frustrating. That is the only reason why I give this game a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating."
5,Buckle up for the ride of your life!,"Move over ""Need for Speed"" there's a new racing game in town that blows the doors off you and the rest of the competition. From the first time I played this game, I was like WOW, can they make it anymore realistic. The graphics are awesome, especially on a HDTV. You feel like you're in Hawaii in just seconds. I also love the soundtrack, the car selection and ease of playing this game. I promise you, play this game for 5 minutes and you'll be as hooked as I am."
3,Average,"I do have to admit ... the graphics on this game are really nice ... but that is about as far as I go. The physics on the cars is, for the most part, cruddy. They do not handle even close to way the car would, nor do they really even sound like the car you are in. I thought it would be cool to start out with the Audi S4 in the game because I own one. The sound was way off and I can do burn outs with smoke coming from the rear?! On a 4-wheel drive car I can do dounuts too!? Just try to do that in a real 4-wheel drive car. I know how the car handles at high speed because I have spent some time on the track as well in it. It was not even close. All the cars handle pretty much exactly the same except for acceleration. BORING. I will just wait for Forza to come out for 360. If you are into a game because the graphics look nice then buy it. If you are looking for a realistic racing game, move on."
1,bad game,"bad game, the overall driveing physics of this game is horrable. When you have a a car thats stickshift and u shift it it lags the gear change like a slow automatic transmission. but if u have a really high end car and u shift it it shifts faster. This shouldnt matter the stickshift on a honda civic should shift as fast as a lambo because its a clutch and a lever and its up to the speed of the hand and foot to change the gear."
2,i beg to differ,"i live on oahu, and was very excited to hear about the game. i even live off one of the major highways in the game....but after i played TDU i was very disapointed that it LOOKS NOTHING AT ALL LIKE OAHU! i mean all the buildings and houses, are gone! there are way more trees, and even the sea life park(featured in 50 first dates) was not there! the roads surrounding it were there, but they put some houses instead. is it so hard to at least program some of the major sites if they are boasting about how the map of the island is accurate? that aside, it is not even that great of a racing game, i would recommend need for speed most wanted instead."
2,this game blows,"the concept of this idea is cool, the layout is cool, but the driving is wack and its confusing and boring. this game could of been a lot better"
3,it's a good game,"I had the PS2 version of this game. The X-Box 360 version is 10000x better. Better graphics, better details, better features, better cars AND Bikes, everything. This game is getting kind of older but for those people who don't want to spend the money I think it's worth picking up."
5,Clear Light of Day is almost the perfect novel.,"I've read this book three times, and every time I wept for the astounding truth it forced me to face. Bim's stubborn acknowledgement is one we all must someday make; even though we should never have to. Families are the most difficult part of life, and they are the most rewarding. No other book that I have read expresses this better than Clear Light of Day (with the exception of Anna Karenina)."
4,The story line is slow very slow,"The main character is a manic depressive woman who is very annoyed with life because it is unfair, and she ended up in the wrong side of the table. So she resents everyone that happened to be lucky enough to avoid life traps and despises those who fell on them. Eventhough the book is beautifully written, the dark mood that the author impress on its main character, permeates to the reader and you become up caught in an atmosphere whereby reading is an effort, so each page develops slow, very slow."
2,Superfluous and slow; leading nowhere..,"If your reading this for the historical context, I can understand why you might give this book a higher rating. If your going to read it for the story itself you might be disappointed... the book goes nowhere slowly...very slowly. Its almost as if the author is trying to prove her obvious mastery of descriptive language at the expense of the story itself."
2,the book that made me drop Asian Lit,"Let me start out by being fair - if you know a lot about Indian history/culture this book MAY interest you even if the first 50 pgs. are excruciatingly slow. Otherwise, you will have a hard time understanding the value behind what the characters do. The whole plot revolves around the woman's place in Indian society & more specifically, Bimla's conflict with her brother, Raja. The conflict seems to begin resolving itself in the last 15 pgs, but the author does not take the time to write out the final scene between sister & brother. Very difficult book to enjoy with no satisfactory conclusion."
2,Day Old Lottery Tickets Are More Interesting,"""...while the morning took another stride forward and stood with its feet planted on the tiled floor."" - p. 10Enough said. If you enjoy bad writing, then this is YOUR page turner. But don't believe the hype. This story is nothing like Chekov"
5,Nice Keyboard. Best I have used...,"Love this keyboard. It is by far the best keyboard I have used for my Clie(third one). What is nice is the smaller keyboards I had needed more steps to get full function. With this keyboard, it is just like I am using my laptop with one exception. Since it folds up it needs to be put on a flat surface. It flexes a little and works best on a flat, firm surface."
5,three-inch nails,"I ordered these nails and they are awesome. I have not used them as yet as I am planning on building a 10x12 salt box shed and will be using these in the construction process for the walls. the order itself came quickly and a quantity of 500, exactly as ordered"
3,"excellent product, lousy shipping","A simple product, well made, well engineered - shipped miserably. When the paper tape is broken up, you end up loading 1/2 rows. Still, they worked fine. I do wish they would just securely tape the box - all sides, even the bottom, then UPS cannot break into a brick. Placing it in a larger box with popped plastic bags was silly."
3,OK soundtrack with that PHAT Master P track,"I thought SCREAM 2 sucked but this soundtrack is good and that MASTER P & SILKK THE SHOCKER track is OFF THE HOOK! Other than that, I thought the DAVE MATTHEWS BAND track was good and ""SUBURBAN LIFE"" by the KOTTONMOUTH KINGS was pretty SWEET too. The first version of ""RED RIGHT HAND"" was MUCH better."
4,kick as$!!!!,this soundtrack is cool onl becuz of the sugar ray an everclear songs. they are the best on here\ an would like all the everclear ab sugar ray fans to pick this one up today. SUGAR RAY AN EVERCLEAR RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ENOUGH SAID. THATS ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. :)
3,Typical teenager music,"This CD has only two things working for it. Okay, okay, I take that back. Only one. But I'll put the other one down as well. The first one (and least important) is that it offers a good blend of tunes. It's not just all metal/rock, it also has some hip hop on it as well. Only thing is that this is geared for teens. I do commend this soundtrack as my point #2 being: ""NICK CAVE"". He's an awesome musician and not very many people listen to him. Buy one of his CDs and not this one. I gave this one 3 stars due to Nick Cave."
3,PHAT Master P track,"I saw Scream 2 and thought it reaked. I want to say it sucked, but these people won't let me. I knew that MASTER P was on the soundtrack, so I bought the soundtrack. That track is PHAT. The rest of the album was Ok. But couldn't touch that P track. The Dave Matthews track was good."
3,Blues Explosion Saves Soundtrack!,"An interesting mix of songs, but yet another stellar showing from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion"
4,"This soundtrack is an above average, highly entertaining cd.","The songs on this soundtrack fit in perfectly with the movie to give it a bit of an egde. It's the kinda music you never get tired of, and listen to when you wanna have a good time. I recommend this cd, and hope all you consumers out there enjoy it!"
2,Scream 2 - not the best soundtrack I've ever heard,"I was a little disapointed when I first listened to the tracks on this album. I found that the majority of the songs sucked. Except ""She Said"" by Collective Soul. I would NOT recommend this soundtrack to anyone."
3,Really nothing you haven't heard before,"Are they technical? Oh yes. Are they talented? Yup. Would they have sounded better about four years ago? Unfortunately, yesInto the Moat plays uber-technical math metal with some touches of hardcore, thrash, grind, death and the obligatory drops into free jazz and progressive rock. This sounds like a tasty concoction, but it has been done before by so many better bands. Early on it was Botch, Coalesce, Dead Guy and Kiss It Goodbye, and then Dillenger Escape Plan, Candiria and Virulence came along and pretty much everyone took notice. Because of that, I can really get into yet another band of skinny short haired guys flailing wildly with ESP guitars and trying to ""out sweep"" every other metalcore-derived shredder out there.I'm giving these guys 3 stars for talent. Although this style of super technical metal doesn't interest me anymore, I will say that Between the Buried and Me pull it off very nicely. I recommend them over Into the Moat"
3,An Amazing Primer,"This is an excellent introductory book to the art of Dowsing that's perfect for any novice and an excellent refresher for the more experienced. The book offers many traditional views mixed with the analytical, allowing the student to understand that Dowsing is a highly flexible skill that goes well beyond the critique and opinion shared by its detractors."
4,The future of mankind?,"This video traces science fiction's history of trying to answer the question; What will WE become? This tape deals with mankind's love and hate relationship with biological experimentation and what the end result might be. It touches on everything from bringing the dead back to life, to robots, androids and even cyborgs. Clips from Sleeper, The Fly, Frankenstein (of course) and Blade Runner. Get it new or used, a must for any sci-fi fan."
5,Great Little Pan,"This is a great saute pan, just love it. There's only 2 of us in this household and its perfect for fixing small portions of vegetables (like green beans, my husband's favorite) and fried rice, italian rice, and great for fixing one egg. Good nonstick surface and was surprised since its the new surface Calphalon has on their pans, but it works great, maybe better than the surface on Calphalon One pots and pans. Remember its a saute pan and not a 12 inch monster. But does a really good job on carmelized onions."
1,Egads! Cement Tight Grip pan,"I bought this pan because I have loved my 30 year old Calphalon pans all these years. I read the information put out by Calphalon and was mislead. I believed it was true until I bought this new ""Tight Grip"" surface skillet. I expected a pan I could cook eggs in and watch them slide out onto my plate. Well, dream on, the eggs stick like cement in this ""non-stick"" pan and are terribly difficult to clean out. The skillet is beautiful to look at, but don't expect it to be non-stick! Now I have to return it to Fields and hope I can get my money back. What a bummer. I feel Calphalon should be ashamed of misleading its customers. My husband thought it was very amusing that I was so happy with Calphalon and then the new-improved version couldn't even cook eggs properly."
3,Sticks when making scrambled eggs,"If you really need a non-stick pan, this is not the pan to get. The non-stick surface does not work very well with heat and no amount of oil will prevent sticking. Scrambled eggs, browning ground beef, or even just preparing some garlic in oil. It all sticks. The good thing about this pan is that you can scrub the heck out of it and the non-stick coating will not come off."
1,This is non-stick?,This pan is the worst one I've ever owned and cost more that most. Everything sticks and it is very hard to clean! I've always hand washed and I put water in right away so nothing has had a change to dry and cake on.I have stainless steal that is far eaiser to keep clean. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Not non-stick!,"I have used this pan 3 times, twice to cook meat. It does not brown; the meat stick to the pan. I made stuffed artichokes last night and even though I used olive oil and water to begin the steaming process, the pan was a mess to clean. I have never had any problems with Myers anodized pans, 18/10 pans or,of couse, teflon. I'm not sure what this pan will be useful for but I believe I will only use it for vegetables or rice."
2,Infused Anodized is NOT non-stick,"Contrary to what store assistants will tell you, these ""new technology"" (Hard Anodized, Infused Anodized) skillets are nothing more than an alternative to steel skillets. If you like to use stainless steel or regular steel skillets, then you may want to try this expensive new toy. Food still sticks to the pan but you don't get rusts. However, I do not see how one can justify the high price.I would recommend Hard Anodized Non-stick for non-stick uses, and stainless steel or regular steel for the rest.The 2-star is for price/performance ratio. If this is a $10 skillet, I would probably give it a 5-star."
4,This new line is definitely a winner!,"Bought the 9 inch chef's pan because of the great discount offered. I'm not a professional chef but consider myself a more that casual home cook. I've been a so-so fan of Calphalon products. I've had good success with their anodized line and some mediocre success with their professional non-stick line. Let's be honest,...the anodized line does work pretty good most of the time but clean-up on some occasions can be a chore. The non-stick line, even if you baby it, does wear out overtime. This new Infused line, at least so far, in my experience with the 9-inch chefs pan does work pretty much as advertised. What little cleaning I do is very quick an easy. I notice that Calphalon now recommends cleaning with BarKeeper Friend, that a very definite recommendation. In fact I also use it on the old anodized line. This new line is worth a try!"
1,Calphalon One Infused Anodized 9-inch Chef's Skillet,"I have always been so pleased with Calphalon cookware until I bought this new ""non-stick"" surface skillet. I bought it because I use the stainless ware and wanted a fry pan I could cook scrambled eggs in without a mess. Well, this is certainly not the pan for that, the eggs stick more in this ""non-stick"" surface than they do in my stainless. I followed the directions but the eggs still stick. The quality of the skillet is tops it is just the ""non-stick"" surface I can not live with. It just seems to me that for $50 one should receive a pan with a surface to which eggs do not stick. I am so upset with it that I am returning it to Calphalon along with a picture of the pan after scrambling or trying to eggs!!!!!"
3,"Still stick, hmm",The skillet is quite expensive. The spots without oil are sticky. I wish there had been a coating inside.
2,HARD ANODIZED PRODUCT,"Very disappointed in the product. After paying over $50 for one small anondized skillet, one would expect the product to be exceptional. Following directions on what may or may not be used in the skillet as a coating or for frying, everything from an egg to potatos have stuck to the bottom. Trying to remove the material from the bottom of the pan is harder than a simple nonstick skillet or a cast iron skillet. Very diappointed in product."
1,HATE THIS CHEF'S PAN,"Bought this $40 9"" chef's skillet about 4 years ago mostly for breakfast eggs. first time was a disaster; cooking AND clean-up. drug it out 2 times since to give it another try. same issues. heat properly, use a little oil -- still burns and sticks and is a huge pain to clean. what a waste of money. i've done a little research and find that Calphalon will not refund. cheapskates."
2,not what I expected,I rigidly followed the directions as far as cleaning and using the pan... still have many things stick. Not really impressed to pay $45.00 for a small pan and still have these problems.
5,Celtika and Iron Grail,"Any fan of mythology will love this book. Brilliantly blends ancient Greek heroes with Arthurian Heroes and a Celtic backdrop. Fast moving story with larger than life characters. I wouldnt spoil the story for anyone but this is a must for any fantasy reader. The only fly in the ointment was Mr Holdstock's chronological displacement of Greek mythological events. The Argonauts came first and then the Trojan War because one of the argonauts was Peleus, Achilles father. In fact it was Peleus' wedding that leads indirectly to the Trojan war. When Eris was not invited to the festivities she cast a gold apple to the guests which was to be given to the fairest. That apple became the prize that Paris later awarded to Aphrodite in exchange for Helen of Sparta. That being said it in no way spoiled the story any more than the changes made to the recent movie Troy. I am eagerly awaiting the third book."
4,Loved it,"I loved this book. Holdstock is a wonderful writter. I did like Mythago better, but highly recommend this talented writer."
5,an inspiring fighter links capitalism and Anti-Semitism,"Abram Leon, a young Belgian revolutionary who died fighting in the resistance to he Nazis in World War II, shows how anti-Semitism and capitalism are linked. He illustrates the special history of the Jews as a ""people class,"" persecuted and manipulated by capitalism. This Marxist study shows that Zionism, rather than aiding the liberation of the Jewish people, aids imperialism, the main breeder of anti-Semitism and Jew hatred. Nathan Weinstock's introduction explaining the life and struggle of Abram Leon is inspiring."
1,The cranks giving this book good reviews don't know squat about history,"So anti-Semitism is caused by capitalism. If that's so true, then why did Hitler kill so many Jewish Capitalists? And why were Jews the only capitalists and individualists during the Feudal era. If capitalism causes racism, then why have freer markets led to a rise in people like Oprah Winfrey, Jon Stewart (a Jew) and others. All forms of collectivism (whether they be communism, socialism, or fascism) have ultimately been destructive for all. The right to own private property and pursue one's own interests so long as it doesn't infringe upon another's same rights (the heart of capitalism) has led to racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. But it has allowed to oppressed groups to rise above such garbage as well. Whereas in all forms of collectivism, any person or group can be oppressed for ""the greater good of society."" Bigotry comes from human ignorance and fear, not social classes, private property rights, or other such things."
5,Captivating,I know what the reviewers want you to believe...that this film is awful and that you won't enjoy it. If you love lovestories then you will love this film. The actors and their relationships are simply captivating all the way up to the end of the film where you understand each motivation and each emotion as if it were your own. So ignore the reviewers! Enjoy this captivating film
4,Another fine remake!,"From time to time Hollywood turns its gaze around excellent but less known French films of old ages and pretends to inspire itself with renovated wishes but at the end nothing happens.The French film in question is le chooses de la vie directed by Claude Sautet, whose main virtue turns around the existential crumbling of a faker ; a man with two faces who establishes a hidden affair and while he is dying as product of a fatal accident, the script makes a gradual and incisive narrative ellipsis.This remake lacks the poetic ability to introduce us in that dreamy atmosphere that oscillates between nostalgia and reality, becoming an average film."
3,THIS ONE WASN'T AS GOOD,"THIS TIME, THE MERCENARY BECOMES A SUBSTITUTE AT A UNIVERSITY TO FIND OUT WHO KILLED HIS FRIEND. NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO, BUT IT'S STILL AN OK MOVIE. HAS SOME GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES, BUT THE PLOT ISN'T AS GOOD THIS TIME AROUND. TREAT WILLIAMS IS STILL A GOOD SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT AS KARL, THE MERCENARY. IT'S STILL A LOT BETTER THAN MOST DIRECT-TO-VIDEO ACTION MOVIES."
4,Almost as good as the second sequel,"I'd like to give this 3 1/2 stars because it's better than Substitute 4 but not the first sequel. The first movie is great by the way. Anyhow, this second sequel is one of the more far fetched sequels. First, there wouldn't be kids in college that act that way - it's more like a high school. Kids throwing things around the room, etc..(this just struck me as funny)This movie has more gratuitous nudity scenes: The wet t-shirt contest, then a threesome by one of the bad guys in a warehouse! That was funny. The fight scenes in this movie are really good, though. The beginning fight was good, the pizza place battle was good, the classroom fight was funny, and the end battle was good too. The movie did take a turn in the middle, where the football team took a backburner to the drug dealers - but that was OK. If you like the second movie you'll like this one."
3,"""The Substitute"" Review","Tom Berenger is the head of a top-secret team of mercernaries, who decides to infiltrate a Miami high school after his girlfriend is beaten up, Nancy Kerrigan style, by one of the students. As it turns out, the school is being run by drug dealers and gang goons who answer to the principal, a former cop who runs a high-grade drug lab out of the basement in the gym. Any movie with Ernie Hudson as an evil high school principal, a wacked-out William Forsythe, and Latin singer Marc Anthony as the juvenile leader of a gang creatively titled the ""Kings Of Destruction"" can't be all bad, can it? Think of it as ""Dangerous Minds"" written for Steven Seagal."
2,DVD The Substitute,"I found this product to be lacking in clarity even thou I have a Sony Bravia, the picture was horribly blurred, there are scenes missing from The substitute with Tom Berenger which is one of my all time favorite action movie. I do not recommend you purchase this particlar DVD from this seller. This is probably why The substitute III Winner Takes All was included, which I never liked that particular movie. I was very disappointed with this DVD and the seller."
1,Horrible,"This movie was really awful. The action scenes were not believable or entertaining, and the acting was high school play level. By the end of the movie, I was laughing at how bad it was. The theme of a teacher who ""really cares"" seeking the truth in an inner city school is way overdone. This movie is not worth the 1.5 hours it takes to sit through it."
4,the substitue 3,very good film. if you liked the first two substitute movies you will like this one too. also if you liked Ivonova on Babylon 5 the same actress is in the cast and provides a great performance too.the action is very high and flows well. does not have any real dead spaces and the story flows smoothly.
4,Very entertaining! Cathartic!,"I watched this movie with my sweet, grandmotherly, grey-haired mother. We both loved it. Something about it struck a chord with both of us.I guess maybe because both of us (yes, even sweet grey-haired mom) have experienced somewhat miserable school experiences--I don't know why, exactly, but something about this film was cathartic. I think we both wished we'd had a school teacher who was a little like the Tom Berenger character in this film.Berenger plays a tough merecenary type who ends up infiltrating a very rough high school, after his teacher-girlfriend is injured by school thugs. We both enjoyed seeing this take-no-BS fellow handle his unruly classes. We *really* enjoyed seeing this.The supporting cast (including Berenger's eclectic collection of mercenary buddies) are excellent. Ernie Hudson as the villan is very effective.A very entertaining film! Recommended."
3,UNBELIEVABLE BUT ENTERTAINING,"Before you watch this film, you have to get prepared for it. That is, don't expect realism here. But, this movie does its main job well, which is to entertain the viewer. A well-made action film, the best parts are in the classroom itself. You root for Berenger and company to get vengeance on these evil gangbanging drug dealers. The film is solid for the first hour and a quarter, but then falls apart somewhat in its slam-bang finish. Not spectacular but a lot better than those awful over-hyped big budget action films."
1,"Like many series, gets progressively worse","The series gets worse and worse. Goes from an important problem (drugs) and somewhat decent movie, to a not so important problem (carjackings) and not so good movie to a really not important one (steroids? seriously, come on) and awful movie, to one that was a fraction of the first and second ones (Just gangs) and a movie you'd need a gun to my head to make me watch. I just hope they continue the series with a secret cd burning organization, or maybe just counterfeit purses. I'm sure whatever they do it'll go straight to video yet again."
2,let me tell you,the only reason i saw this movie cause it was filmed at my high school miami senior high.i wasnt going there at the time but my sister was. so i saw it and didnt like it much but it was cool to see the school on film and know ive been there millions of times. p.s the school is not all f**ked up like they showed it they spray painted it and messed it up for filming.
5,The real deal,"This product is simple and efficient. It plugs in, monitors voltage, and reacts when needed. Great value for the money."
4,"APC Power Regulator - Plug it in, Turn it on-Seems to be working",Overall - it appears to do what it advertises - protects more sensitive electronic equipment when printers and copiers suck up the juice and cause the momentary dimming of the lights in our house. (Of course -that may just be the faulty wiring by Georgia builders in 1984).One of them seemed to think there was an over current for a while - but then it finally turned green. Don't know what that was all about - but it appears to be working ok now. The other one cut off the power to the computer when the printer fired up on the same circuit - still troubleshooting that since I believe the battery back up should have caught that.
4,A satisfied user,I have used APC LE1200 voltage regulators for a couple of weeks. I have had no problems so far. I have noticed high voltage indication on the unit many times and am glad that this device is there to protoect my expensive electronic gadgets. I chose it because of APC's brand name and I guess it is one of the best makes in the market.
5,Line Filter,"I use two of these APC voltage regulators to maintain voltage to sensitive electronics. They really work. I get occasional voltage spikes, and these APC regulators give a audible switch noise when that happens. It also gives me a secondary switch to turn on or off my electronics.I feel safer knowing my sensitive electronics are protected from over/under voltage."
3,Malfunctioning?,"I just got mine and I've found some interesting things.I tested the voltage on all the lines (even replacing the batteries in my voltmeter with new ones and testing again.)In all tests I found:On the 110 and 120 setting the output voltage was 109VOn the 127 setting the output voltage was usually 122V (ranging from 120 to 123)So, I RMA'd the unit and they sent me a new one.It tested exactly the same way. Not quite what I would have expected from a line conditioner set to 120.Have other people with these actually tested the output voltage with a meter? And if so, what did it show?"
5,Voltage regulator,"Chose this product for peace of mind, protecting newly purchased HDTV.Used this product for years at work where there was dirty power (spikes, big drops, etc), and it extended the power source life of our computers significantly. I expect it to do the same at home.It has lights in front and makes a clicking sound when it goes into action.Price is very reasonable."
3,Works great for 110V and 127V regulation but not 120V,I purchased this regulator for the 120V regulation capability. After receiving the voltage regulator I tested it and noticed it works very well for 110V and 127V regulation. The performance on 120V regulation was poor at best. I returned this product but would purchase it if I required a 110V or 127V regulator. Amazon was great on the return (as usual).
2,apc le1200 line-r 1200va automatic voltage regulator,"had bought this item sent back it does not have enough plug and trhe software was outdated,almost made me think that it was an older model"
1,defective,"it does not work as advertised. Voltage output is not 120V, I measure it with the volt meter it changes to 118V to 123V, just like my wall output,I purchase it here refurbished, I might have the defective one. Yours might going to work but mine doesn't and I am not going to give it a one more chance, I am returning it today.Follow up: 118v to 123v is probably not too bad for your devices. So I might returned a device that actually works. I remember I have seen even less voltages but I can't remember clearly. So research more, do not trust me."
1,Garbage of a product!!!!!!!,"It doesn't do what it is supposed to do, it either doesn't work at all or malfunctions. By the way that is the second in a raw that doesn't work so I guess the whole line of UPC is broken. And I know what I am talking about because I measured everything.First one I ordered didn't do anything the second way almost ruined my computers. Sorry I don't have time to describe all details but in short it made my voltage jump from 112V to 125V and was supposed to keep it at 120V. And by the way I read to more of the same reviews like mine after that so I am not the only one."
3,APC LE1200 Review,The overall quality of this voltage regulator is good. The under voltage / over voltage leds are a nice feature. I purchased this devise to provide a stable voltage source to my computer equipment. My original problem before I purchased was my dsl model would drop off due to my line voltage dropping low whenever I started my vacuum cleaner (the starting current of the motor is apparently quite large). Based on the reviews and specs I thought this device would eliminate the problem. Well -- no change. Even with the LE 1200 regulator whenever I start my vacuum in the house the momentary drop in line voltage is not compensated for by the regulator and my modem drops off line.
5,It does't get any better,"I have one of these units on every expensive electrical item in my house . . . Plasma & LCD TV's: eight of those, computers: four of those, home theater setups: two of those . . . . APC only makes quality and reliability . . . outstanding products . . . . highly recommended!"
4,Nice product,"It's nice, i just would like to have more information in the manual, but keeps my electronics safe and my computers dont get hot!"
1,Don't look here to protect your Stereo,"I purchased this unit to take control of an audible electrical ""buzzz"" that comes from turning on certain lights in my house fitted with CFL bulbs or compact fluorescent bulbs. This noise was so intense it actually completely halted the sound coming from my stereo during the first second the light was switched on so I turned to this unit for help.It has not changed a thing which makes me realize there is no protection going here. The Stereo is not isolated from surges or strange frequencies or quick draws as the sound clearly indicates.I would not recommend this product for power conditioning. You're better of with a Furman power conditioner made specifically for protecting your valued gear.I guess you get what you pay for? A 100 dollar power strip? Disappointing.Buyer beware"
5,very stable,My electric is eradict and flucuates. I live in a isolated area on top of a mountain. This Line-R AVR takes care of all. APC makes quility products.
4,Very Good,"I purchased two of these voltage regulators,in order to protect electronic devices (TV,VCR, PC,router, cable modem)while using a generator. I lost power for 7 days during Sandy, and both regulators worked perfectly."
4,It is perfect for me,This product is just a big circuit breaker with enhanced functanlities but it does the job and that is all i need it is like 1/2 feet by 3 inches.I would have bought a ups but i lower range ups 100-150$ the circuit breaking and voltage regulation is no help at all.I Will suggest it to any one wants to secure expensive tv or electronics Best of luck
5,Just what I needed,Purchased this product to run between a lower end generator and electronic equipment (flat screen TV and sound equipment). It worked prefectly. I never noticed any wavering of the TV signal or white noise or hum on the sound equipment. It seems to be a very well built unit and was much cheaper than some of the comprable units. I find it to be a sound investment to protect your electronics.
4,No right angle plug....,"I haven't had this long and have yet to have a power event trip it to adjust...but it handles my main gaming desktop and secondary desktop and 3 large screens and speaker system. I am only using one plug on the back of this unit. I have an TripLite ISOBAR-UTLRA8 plugged into this AVR unit. With this combination, I should be good in case anything happens.WHY!? APC....why would you not put a right angle/flat plug on the end of this thing...It has a standard plug with a nice thick cable, that sticks out about 4 inches from wall...annoying me as I am afraid it might get bumped or knocked out of wall outlet since it sticks out and is not flat against the wall... guess I'll just have to get an adapter cord.."
5,Brilliant...(don't tell anyone),"I've loved having John's solo work all to myself...pop music's best kept secret...music to share with your most musically sophisticated friends...music for long road trips. I suppose that's all over now.And it's about time.Because this MF is too big, too smart, too rocking, too cutting, to be denied a wide audience. I would love to see this thing come out of left field and sell 6 million copies, and have John win 5 or 6 Grammy's next February. Not that awards mean anything, but every once in awhile it's nice to see an exceptional artist, at his best, get recognized.Besides, John has the best hair in rock and roll. ""John, see you in Denver (6/22). Yrs. George Tadich Jr."""
4,No Xperience Needed,"On the whole the album is mixed, but the highlights are well worth the price of admission. This is just great song writing. You'll get 1/3 of some of the best songs you'll own, 1/3 that are pretty good, and 1/3 you'll play a couple of times. 'Unforgiven' alone makes Ryan Adams look like a Simpson sister. If you own any X or John Doe, then you'll love it. If you respect the craft of the song, then you'll really love it."
4,prendi la cosi,"This song is the only reason to buy this album, is so beautiful and well composed, you can hear the influence of the disco sounds of the seventies."
3,Alot like Cocteau Twins,"If you like Cocteau Twins, Enya, and that type of music then you'll like Magnetic. They're good musicians. I heard these guys on NPR and ran out and bought the CD. If you're looking for something a bit more upbeat but in the same vein, check out Castle of Crime by Lakuna. Awesome drum rhythms."
1,Muti-everything,"First heard a brief review on PBS radio. Most interesting combination of Electronica, Jazz, Hip Hop, blues, rock, Martin Denny, Lounge, Bombay, and a big sound from a small group...While most tunes seem to be an extension of a fundamental theme, they will keep your fingers tapping from album start to album finish. The occasional muted trumpet, soft violin and vibes add a hint of sophistication not usually heard in Club groups. If you don't have shakey leg syndrome, you will after this CD.Bob"
5,Another Mark Mckenzie gorgeous score,"The Lost Child is a true story of a Native American woman who discovers unconditional love, a nurturing spiritual heritage, and a father's affirmation. The story powerfully conveys the strength that comes from a loving, emotionally and spiritually connected family. Mckenzies score is melodic, pastoral, emotional and beautiful music to support the drama of The Lost Child. There are numerous solos with harp, cello, piano, classical guitar, flute, oboe, and clarinet; often with underlying muted strings. The Indian ethnic music is subtle, yet present in the wood flute playing the mother's weaving theme (track #7).It is just one many scores by the composer that echo the same beautiful music. Mckenzie writes from his heart and doesn't miss with every cue with his music on this warm, lovely piece. It is a score I have listened to many times and am always emotionally affected by it in a positive way. Highly recommended."
2,Again....Wait for the masters....,"Like the last review...wait for the remasters. I have the new remix/remaster of ""Remember the Future"" and it is almost frightening how much better it sounds. The song selection is good on this collection, however, so it could almost be a good intro to Nektar..."
3,This is not Hesse at his best!,"When Demian was first published in 1919 I can imagine that the book would have had a strong impact. In certain circles this novel still is a spiritual guide, but it certainly does not have the true literary excellence of Hesse`s best works. There are some very good bits and pieces along the way, but the story is not sharp enough and it makes it seem too long. Hermann Hesse wrote books both before and after Demian that was far more superior and should not suffer from lack of interest in the belief that Demian is one of his major works."
5,A book that really finds everyone sooner or later...(I hope),"Simply put, this is a masterwork that everyone finds or get found by sooner or later. One of those books that you hear about and then when you are finally ready to read it springs out at you... To say too much would be to ruin it... Just trust the fact that more than 50 people have given it rave reviews..."
2,Interesting but self-indulgent and rather ill-conceived,"Despite its enduring popularity, this novel is certainly not among Hesse's best. The author's painful, overriding preoccupation with his own emotions (which in novels like Narcissus and Goldmund and Siddartha is transformed into high art) here becomes blatant, self-indulgent, adolescent, and ultimately rather irritating. The novel starts out promisingly and provides some very powerful images, but after a few chapters it begins to degenerate into outright silliness. The ending is especially unconvicing, suggesting that Hesse had trouble leading his story to a conclusion. Those with highly introspective temperaments like Hesse's might enjoy the novel, and those with a special interest in the author would do well to study it, but the same themes it develops are treated much much more satisfyingly in other of his novels."
2,Couldn't do it,"I tried to read it. No luck. I almost finished it. But every time I picked it up I felt like I was punishing myself. Why force my way through a book that is so . .. . boring? I think I was hoping the end would twist the whole thing around. Maybe it does. But the more I read, the less faith I had in the book to be interesting.What is wrong with it? All it offers is the charm of the main character. If the main character had charm, that would keep me reading. But he didn't.It reads sort of like a tract for some sort of progressive, new-ageish, neo-pagan, pluralistic spirituality. The main character discovers some sort of ancient ultimate truth that only he and a few other people are gifted enough to realize. It is reminiscent of the spirituality of some of the Modernists, particularly Yeats.All I can say is the book was too boring to finish."
1,Boring and Banal,In his exhausting attempts to find religious mysticism Hesse has managed another seminal work of boredom. Like in Siddhartha what starts off as a good little story (by the way what happened with Franz Kromer?) deteriorates quickly as Hesse tries to explain the unknown. The book then draws on insipidly and concludes in banality.
1,I don't think this book is very insightful,"I think this book is about a guy falling in love with his friend's mom, correct? You can't just rule your life out of your society as the Essenes did in the 1st century. If you want to find yourself, you should find it among your fellow companions, not some guy who says he has Cain's mark on his head. And as a Christian, I really can't understand why people think this book is insightful. I'd rather read more valuable novels that gives me inspiration in life."
1,Sketchy publisher,"My wife is teaching this novel in German and ordered this so I could read it in English. There are some problems with this edition. The publisher, BN Publishing, does not list a city or location of publication. An internet search for BN publishing and a visit to their website reveals no information about who they are. They publish all kinds of works, mostly nonfiction. This edition of Demian has no introduction, and the translator is not identified. This and the lack of a publisher location make the edition useless for academic work because it can not be properly referenced. I can't say this with certainty, but I suspect the publisher is reprinting a translation for which the copyright has expired and is not crediting the translator. We sent the book back and are planning to purchase the Dover German-English edition."
4,"Hideously well written, Extraordinarly well thought...","Demian is one of the very best books I have ever read in my life. Especially people who enjoy reading Kahlil Gibran, Friederich Nietcshe, should enjoy reading this book. This book makes you think about our everyday life, and especially some of our childhood memories. It is well thought, and well written, but I recoomend you get a good translation of it."
5,Got me hooked on Hesse,"""Demian"" is the first book I read by Hermann Hesse, and it got me hooked on his novels. This book is fascinating, so much so that it's difficult to describe. It's both a coming-of-age story (although I hate that term)and also a surreal and erotic delve into the subconscious. The themes of spirituality, sexuality, suffering and redemption are all weaved together in this novel, as they are in the other equally fascinating novels by Hesse I've read. I'd also highly recommend ""Steppenwolf"" and ""Siddhartha""."
3,Big little book,"Demian is only nominally a novel. The book is really just a vehicle for Hesse's philosophy. So that's the first thing you should know if you are thinking about reading it.Demian deals with themes of childhood, ""growing up,"" friendship, art, war, society, intellectualism, and probably touches on homosexuality as well. If these themes interest you at all you should find Hesse's opinions on them interesting - the author's voice comes through so clearly in the book you sometimes forget it is a story at all rather than an essay.Demian seems very much locked in its time (immediately after WW I) and was probably much more compelling for readers back then than it is now. It's not a tough read, though. Just remember to stop and think."
5,Profound,"This is one of the best books I've read. If you're a fan of Hermann Hesse and you haven't read it, READ IT. If you've never read any Hesse, this makes a great starting book."
2,Insights Into a Human Soul Are Not Enough,"I was somewhat dissapointed in 'Demian.' I had never read Hesse before and I was prepared to really enjoy this book. I thought that it started off well but the middle was very boring and the end was too weird for words. I finished the book not because I was curious but because I can't stand not to finish a book. It wasn't complete rubbish but there are better psychology/philosophy books out there. Read 'Siddhartha' instead, that is Hesse at his best."
2,An amazing start but progressively dissapointing,"The first chapter of this book was so good. Hesse writes about the character's childhood with such rich reflection and prose. People just don't write like this today. He's so in touch with his surroundings, his emotions, his inner self. After that it becomes less compelling tormented navel gazing. Sinclair, the main character idealizes his boyhood friend who has this odd and completely ridiculous take on a few Bible stories. So, he's a boy who marches to the beat of his own drum, how romantic (you get the picture) and eventually meets his friends mother. It then goes down into trivial mysticism. The family are like theosophists. No compelling take on anything. the book talks a lot about ones 'Fate'. Compared to some heavy and enjoyable literature along this vein, I found this drivel. I will try some other Hesse though."
5,My favorite book.,AMAZING book. What else can I say? I've read it time and again and can always relate and feel peace that there are souls like Herman Hesse in the world.
4,A Bag of Bricks in the Face!,I will forever be changed by this amazing work of fiction... It should be mandatory reading for the worlds lost youth!
3,This is not Hesse at his best!,"When Demian was first published in 1919 I can imagine that the book would have had a strong impact. In certain circles this novel still is a spiritual guide, but it certainly does not have the true literary excellence of Hesse's best works. There are some very good bits and pieces along the way, but the story is not sharp enough and it makes it seem to long. Hermann Hesse wrote books both before and after Demian that was far more superior and should not suffer from lack of interest in the belief that Demian is one of his major works."
5,A book for the intensely troubled.,"It is some time since I have read this book and I want to read it again since I have carried a rather powerful impression of this. This book explores the dichotomy in human existance and values. Explores the growing up of man, and how ultimately, simply by striving to grow up to his true potential, he is destrying phoenix like, the bonds that surround(?) him. The way the author likens the 'different' as having the mark of Cain has always terribly impressed me. Probably the book is meant for people who carry the mark of Cain. Like the other Hermann Hesse book, this book also explores the maturing of a life, the focus is more in this case on destruction of bonds where as in the case of Siddhartha, the focus was on changing values and control of self...."
1,Fraud!!! Do not be fooled!,Crap product - bag burst with only 14 lbs turkey in it...water everywhere. Do not be fooled do not buy this product...
2,It's a bag,Way too expensive for what you get. Next time use a cheap trash bag and cheap cooler (that can be used more than once) and a bag of ice to keep cool. Why pay $10 for a plastic bag to use once and throw away?
3,Be Careful. Product Description Is Wrong,"My rating is based on the description and not the actual product because I have not yet used it. I needed a large brining bag for a 22 pound turkey. The product description says, ""Extra heavy weight with gusseted bottom for easier storage; holds up to a 25 pound turkey with brining solution"". When the product arrived, it clearly states on the box that it will hold up to a 20 pound turkey with brining solution. In my case, the 5 pound difference is a big deal since my turkey is over the 20 pound limit. It is a heavy bag and looks as if it will work great, just not for my 22 pound bird."
5,"Worry no more - This bag is strong, sturdy, and mess free","I was a bit afraid to try this bag, but am happy to say that it was mess free and perfect for the 23 lb. turkey I brined for Thanksgiving. It was strong, sturdy, and kept the turkey submerged while sitting on the refrigerator shelf. Maybe the best part of all is that there's no mess to clean up.You do need to take care not to overfill the bag with liquid, but sealing it up was simple enough. I was worried that it was TOO simple and wouldn't stay sealed, but it did and I'm back here on the site buying another one for this year's turkey."
2,Not as good as they made it sound,"I followed the directions on the package EXACTLY this Thanksgiving when I used it to brine my turkey and the bag is nearly impossible to seal. I ran my fingers over the seal over and over again, it took me over 20 minutes to get the bag to FINALLY seal (After I got a load of brine all over me). It was a thick bag and appeared to be sturdy. Once I did finally get it to seal it did not leak, but I think I'll find a different brand of bag for the Christmas turkey."
4,Innocence lost,"Soundtrack from a 1977 film with lovely instrumental music, melodious and pensive, slightly melancholic (in a way that some of Erik Satie's composition are), but also optimistic or even cheerful, sometimes at the same time (! ). Nice string arrangements, monophonic synthesizers... A sense of the lost innocence is abound, which reflects the theme of the movie but also corresponds to the same sentiment of my own ""lost innocence"" of the early -teen years, and perhaps of the '70s in general."
4,touch your heart thorugh simplicity,"I can't remember how many times I repeat this cd again and again. Of course, it will remind you all the contents and beauty from the movie, and more important-- you are thinking and feeling at the same time. But, I have to admit that if you didn't see the movie(video), one or two songs may be strange to you. This is why I drop one star."
5,I'm impressed and I'm a local.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'm from Portsmouth, NH, where it takes place and I felt like I was seeing the town new, and reading an original, honest, fresh description of it. I loved the characters. I can't believe they weren't based on real people. They truly touch you and keep you thinking. . .A novel with honest impressions, feelings, yet not one that hits you over the head with its theme. Very, very beautifully written. A gifted writer with insight is Joe Coomer."
4,"HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT","I loved this book, and spent part of a long weekend finishing it, since I was reading my daughter's copy and had to leave it with her. All three main characters, plus the setting, are wonderful. My only complaint about the story was the finally revealed secret about Charlotte's relationship with her husband. I couldn't buy that explanation, and felt there should have been some clues earlier in the story."
5,This book read so well that I didn't want to reach the end.,"I enjoyed this book so much that I insisted my best friend read it on the plane on her way to Maine to ""get in the mood."" The descriptions of the Northeast shoreline were transporting. So often books about women and their relationships with each other are superficial -- not here. This book was written in such an intelligent manner that it kept my complete attention from beginning to end. The relationships of the three women with their individual family members were portrayed so realistically that I could personally relate to each of them. And a man wrote this book? Keep writing Joe!"
4,"3 Women, a boat and a dog","An admitted fan of the author. Bought this book after reading ""Spoonful"". Being male, I can not tell you if this is really how these women would think/act. However, for someone interested in boats, it was a good read. My wife liked it as well. See previous reviews for the nitty, gritty details."
2,Among The Dullest Books I've Ever Read,"I read this in the spring of 2004 and don't think I've yet recovered. Why does a novel like this merit praise? It has ridiculously unlikable characters, including a flatulent old lady who likes to vandalize the town, a bitchy teenaged single mother with smelly feet, and a woman who in her unmitigated selfishness causes her husband's suicide after she aborts his baby. It had virtually zero plot, it had a dozen missed opportunities for using set-ups that practically fall into the author's lap (witch's graves in a 17th century graveyard??? how cool is that? but what's he do with it? almost nothing!) and it ends with this impossible compromise among its main figures that left me wondering if anyone was buying it. I truly dislike this book, as I guess you can tell."
2,Potboiler masquerading as serious literature.,"Why do men think they can get into women's heads?If you want to read a bad try at the above, read""Beachcombing."" The title should give you a hintof the pretentiousness of this small novel. Three womenare thrown together on a ship (floating - get it?)that is moored to land (disconnected from reality - what an original metaphor). One is senile, one is stupid, and the last is a grieving widow archaeologist (trying to understand the past, in case you didn't figure it out). There are moments of witty one-liners, but for the most part the book reads somewhere between a sailing manual, archaeological report, and story of three one-dimensional women. I'd love to see this plot redesigned by a sensitive woman."
2,Not good quality,"I was excited about the price and color choices, but this product is cheap. Doesn't wash well, and isn't soft. Also, onesie is very wide, and not very long. Wouldn't fit an average-sized baby."
1,WAY too big,"I ordered this onesie and got it sent straight to an embroidery shop I use. The onesie was bought for my daughters birthday pictures. When I got this onsie it was all wrong. It's way bigger than the size they say and the neck hole is very large and not at all proportionate to the rest of the onesie. Also, the quality is very poor. Therefore, I couldn't use the onesie for my daughters birthday so it totally ruined my plans for pictures. I would NOT recommend this product and would never order this brand again! If I could, I would give it 0 stars."
1,Too cute for me,"I have been working with my wife for over 15 years. Recently, we've had some friction in a new venture. I hoped this book would offer some solid, business savvy advice. Unfortunately it was not that deep. And although I agree with the authors about the importance of a sense of humor, I found the ""humor"" in this book lacking in underlying wisdom and too cutesy for my taste.Most of the book is made up of brief profiles of other businesses. This sounds like it would be interesting, but after reading several, they all seemed like PR blurbs about the companies, never revealing very much.In the end, I returned it."
1,Ruined my PDA,"This item made my PDA crash continuously when attempted to use. Finally, somehow made the PCB burn! Don't buy this."
1,It does nothing.,"Waste of money. I don't recommend taking 3 pills before bedtime like the directions say, you won't be able to fall asleep.That's really all it does. It wires you up a little. You'd be better off taking a vitamin supplement."
3,This stuff works,"I actually learned of the powers of Yohimbe after seeing those Commercials on TV for a product that would add 1-3 inches to a man size. I laughed at the ads, but a friend told me he used the stuff...so I looked for the active ingrediant...while the stuff may not add 3 inches, it will defintely super charge your erections and libido....however, it will also mess up your sleep and make you anxious....so do you want to be 18 again.....its fun but travel at your own risk."
1,THERE IS BETTER BOOKS,"USP USE MOSTLY HPLC METHODOLOGY THAN OTHERS PHARMACOPOEIAS, LIKE EUROPEAN PHARMACOPEIA, PORTUGUESE PHARMACOPEIA, BRAZILIAN PHARMACOPOEIA THAT USES MORE ECONOMICAL METHODS THAN HPLC.EUROPEAN PHARMACOPOEIA IS RECOGNIZED WORLWIDE."
1,Numbingly boring,"Far from the good escapist thrill I expected from the reviews below, this book is an absolute snoozer. The characters are like dinosaurs in a tar pit--they move at a geological pace, with every klutzy plot move telegraphed 50 pages in advance. Then there's the unpleasant racial and ethnic stereotyping. I ordered ""The Cure"" on the basis of online browsing, i.e. other readers' recommendations and ""also read"" information--now I remember why it's better to look at mysteries before buying them!"
2,Below Average Read,"This book dragged. Good plot but took forever to get through it. And, although the cure costs $70,000 a year and a few lives to create, the author paints the daughter as a hero for ending it and allowing her father to develop the disease again. In the real world it would go on because someone would pay to keep Alzheimer's at bay for themselves or from a family member REGARDLESS of the cost. The daughter in this book didn't really have the money to continue to give her father the medication anyway and I wonder if she was really rich if she would have been so quick to stop her father's treatment or even looked into what he was getting.The plot is not really original but it could have been so much more interesting."
3,Interesting Premise,"The most important thing to me in rating this book was the subject matter. It held my interest so I could overlook a lot of its problems. This isn't a very well written book. The dialog, in particular, doesn't always ring true and in fact, is a little annoying at times. However, the premise is interesting and well presented. The suspense is unrelenting and the characters are well developed. Carl, who has Alzheimer's disease, is especially realistic. This is a fast and interesting read if you can ignore the slightly awkward writing style."
4,Solid overview of strategy,"I do not know what people want from a trading book, it is inherently difficult to convey all the nuances associated with making a trade, especially when you are talking about day trading.The author does a solid job of laying out his approach which should serve as a good place to start for new traders.The reviewer who was so down on this book and referenced that the author, if such a good trader, should simply manage money rather than selling a book, truly understood day trading, he wold have realized that day trading (as described in the book) is simply not scalable to a point where you could manage millions of dollars.Walter Devon"
5,Undercover with a reverse twist,"Very well written, if somewhat uneven, this ""non fiction novel"" traces the career of a master undercover ""nark"" who slowly comes to realize that the ""honor among theives"" of the criminals he pursues is to some extent more worthy than the duplicitous code of the cops. Along the way, we are treated to a fascinating tour of the high-stakes underworld of the big time dealers. Very poetic in parts, and leaves one pondering the moral ambiguities of the ""war on drugs."""
5,haunting true story of u/c narcotics officer,"As he did in Down by the River, Charles Bowden takes the reader deep into the shadow world that is the war on drugs. This book reads like a well crafted literary mystery novel - think Graham Greene or Scott Turow -except it's true. If you read both River and Shadow, you'll get some idea of the personal toll the drug war takes on the cops and their families, and also wonder how they can go out and fight this evil day after day and year after year. Especially since the street agents are the ones who pay the biggest price, while the ""suits"" play the career game. Joey O'Shea could be the model for Sonny Crockett in Miami Vice."
2,TOO MUCH SINGING,"My son loves this story (10 yrs old,) and wanted a video on it. On the key action moments they break out in song instead of accurate depiction. Would not reccommend."
2,Mixed bag for kids,"We got this after watching other videos from the series. My kids, ages 5 and 10, were a bit put off by what they viewed as random bursts of opera. They found it a distraction and not as kid friendly as the others. It's not awful, just not the best one."
3,meh,"meh, thats how i feel about this product. its in a nice packaging and when using it its a pretty thin base. it does go on nice but more like a serum for your face type of feel to it but its still a nice feeling. i wouldn't say to use this alone without ur primer but it does give somewhat moister to the skin under the makeup. i won't really purchase this again but its still nice to have around."
4,Excellent instructions,"This book was used as a textbook for an accessory design class I took in college. The pictures in the book are helpful. I used their patterns with higher quality glass beads (than were shown in the book), and created some beautiful things. It is the perfect book to show you how to start this type of beading, and you can alter the simple patterns to make them more complex once you know these basics."
2,Sorry I bought this book,"I was highly disapointed with this book. Although the pictures are beautiful, many are variations on the instructions,which I found confusing. Although it was fairly easy to follow the thread path once I got going, it was VERY difficult to figure out where to start. I made up several items, and none meet up to my expectations, the loops don't ""loop"" and the necklaces don't drape."
3,Good addition to any beadwork library,"I enjoyed the book. However, beginners may have some difficulty with the patterns. This book mainly concentrates on the focal part of the pattern(s). Does not really get into detail about how to begin and end the piece. Some designs were a bit to simple for me but gave me ideas on how to expand on the patterns presented in the book.With a little imagination I think this would be a great book for a beginner, plus the price is not bad at all."
4,chocolate chip cookies,"The recommendations that influenced me to purchase these cookies were right on. They are gluten free. The large chocolate chips satisfied my chocolate craving. A satisfying chocolate chip cookie for all of us that are new to a gluten free diet.Try it, you'll like it!"
2,A bit chalky,I like many of Pamelas gluten free products but this one is not as tasty as her mini chocolate chip cookie or her ginger cookies. I would give it a 2.5 if I could.
5,"So Good, Even My Kids Like 'Em","I can't eat wheat, and it's hard to find cookies and baked goods that don't taste like cardboard, or worse. These chocolate chunk cookies are so good, even my kids beg for them. There are lots of large, chocolate chunks, and just enough cookie to hold them together. They're gluten free, so whether you have a wheat allergy or a gluten sensitivity, these work. I've tried every brand of wheat-free cookie, and these are by far the best."
4,Pamela's Chunky Chocolate Chip Cookies,"These cookies are very rich, and at something like 120 calories for one cookie, that is probably a good thing - you won't overeat. I like them, though, and they are the closest glutenfree chocolate chip cookie I have been able to find. They make a very good treat for when I'm craving something really sweet!"
2,Gluten free cookies,"Sorry, but I didn't like these cookies. The chocolate was good but the cookie part was not. I would rather not have any rather than eat these. Pamelas makes some good cookies, but not these."
5,This is how the cookie (does not) crumble,"I've always found my favorite Pamela's pecan shortbread in (tasty) pieces, either when buying them from the store or ordering them online. Imagine my surprise when the new Organic Chocolate Chunk Pecan Shortbread showed up packed well enough to survive a direct hit from a nuclear warhead-not a single cookie was so much as dinged! The new packing for the individual cookie packets is amazing. The cookie packets are lined up, single file, in this long, super heavy cardboard box. You could whack somebody with that sucker and not crack a cookie. I wish ALL flavors of Pamela's cookies came packed like this. So now not only are Pamela's cookies delicious, they also show up in one piece (at least the single serving packet ones do)."
1,Not very tasty,I don't like the taste of these cookies. The chocolate is good but the cookie part leaves a lot to be desired. Definitely prefer the Pecan Shortbread.
1,Gross,"I have been gluten free for about six months now and have yet to find an edible prepackaged cookie. These were just as bad as all the rest. I remember as a little kid eating a dog biscuit on a dare, add some chocolate chips and that is exactly what they taste like."
1,bad taste,This company protected these cookies very well with great packaging but the taste is not there. I would never purchase again.
1,YUCK!! No Taste,I just found out that I have Celiac Disease. I bought these at a local supermarket really excited that I could have a cookie after 2 months of no bread or cookies and was very disppointed. They had no taste. I tried to mask it with Vanilla Ice Cream but it didn't work so I tossed them. Maybe the pack I got had been on the shelf too long not sure but I did not like them. I realize that things made without wheat are going to taste differently and maybe I need to get used to that but I really can't eat these..
3,Gluten Free Crumble,I liked these cookies alright for some reason my son liked them too. The flavor like someone else said was kinda yucky they could defiantly use some more improvement on that part. The Chocolate in the cookie was good oh ya they crumbled a lot or broke into pieces. I don't think I will be buying these again.
4,best store bought GF cookie I have had!,"I just recently have gone gluten free and miss my chocolate chip cookies! i bought these at a local grocery store and I think they are wonderful. They still have that ""store bought"" cookie taste BUT I can't tell the difference between other store gluten-full cookies! They are a bit steep at 120 calories per cookie but sometimes it is just worth it!"
3,Good for Gluten-free,"This is not a fabulous tasting cookie, but it is better than some of the gluten-free cookies that I have had. I like to have something once in awhile without having to bake it myself. The chocolate chips are large and do taste good. The Walmart in this area sells this cookie and I would recommend buying a box there first to find out if you like it. If you do, then ordering six boxes here would make sense."
4,Weighty but Worth It.,"Brings clear insight to why Christians believe in the doctrine of the Trinity by presenting the primary sources. If you are not accustomed to reading works from the first few centuries this book will be a little difficult to read at first. However, it is well worth the effort. Though these writings are not modern by any stretch of the imagination, they are brilliant and well thought out. Read it today if you want to know why Christians believe in One Triune God."
3,I was disappointed.........,"A very educational book. However, for the novice layman, it needs upgrading. I was disappointed because there is no index to the references mentioned. This is very definitely not for the lay student of casual interest; which should include every Christian. The introduction needs to be re-written for the lay person, to include definitions, footnotes, appendix, bibliography of the writings cited, etc. Too many terms, vocabulary, and references not sourced."
2,Not as useful as hoped.,"Tried to use this for a long time on multiple babies since we had a pool. Unfortunately, I could never get it set so it was very useful. Seems like a great concept, but I found the thing to be too slack and the baby would fall all over the place.I had to keep my hands on all the time. And the baby couldn't interact in the water with the parent very well which is the entire reason for being in the water.The carrier seemed ill fitting for me."
2,A Bad Mickey Spillane,"I tried this Ed Lacy book. I was looking for pulp detective fiction. I knew this was dated, but I thought it could be a good detective noir story. Only, after getting halfway through I didn't care what happened. I love Dashiel Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Ross McDonald, and the genre. This was a failure."
3,Pretty cool find...,"The product is really cool looking, and was something I was comfortable wearing not only in the water, but walking around. The best part is, they kept me from getting reef rash in Jamaica!!! It was really hard washing sand off the inside of the shoe, however, and the back of it dug into the back of my ankle and took a huge chunk out of my skin. Maybe you'll have better luck?"
5,Just as advertised,"It is nice to have the availability of these smaller project packs, obviating the need to purchase 2000 or 5000 count cases.The product is quality made and packaged and more importantly does its job."
4,"Good album, excellent singer","Lucio Battisti is the best italian singer that I ever heard. In this album there are many great hit's from 70's but Battisti has others excellent songs that aren' t in this CD. The sound it is not good enough, but we have to remember that the original record was done in analogic form and many years ago. If you like good italian music, you will enjoy this album and this poet and singer. You have to buy ""Si Viaggiare... 1976-1982"" by Licio Battisti too, in order to complete the series."
4,WONDERFUL SONGS,"My girlfriend and I played ""Drop out"" for hours in 1969/70 and I promised her ""dont worry""'and now we are married for 42 years. Now we are happy to have the CD for the LP is not so good anymore"
2,Memories are sometimes best left that way,"Way back in the 70's I had vinyl versions of both 'The Use of Ashes' and 'Balaklava' by Pearls before Swine - then some lousy person stole them. Years later I bought a CD of The Use of Ashes and found it was just as good as I remembered it - a great album indeed and Tom Rapp's voice iconic. My memory of Balaklava was that it was more of the same and so must also be great, right?Wrong unfortunately - it is an interesting album, as is 'One Nation Underground' (these two albums making up the content of the Complete Esp-Disk Recordings)but nowhere near as good as 'The Use of Ashes'.So unless you are a very keen fan, or like curiosities or are studying the music of the 60's & 70's I just wouldn't bother.P.S. The quality isn't all that great anyway."
4,An almost timeless novel of business dealings and love.,"Cameron Hawley is a distant relative of mine, and that is how I happened to decide to read this book. I did not know anything about the book, except that it was a novel about a businessman. The story does not set any specific time frame, which keeps it from being dated by any specific references to historic events. The chance encounter between Cash and the boss' daughter is still as viable today as it was when it was first written. There is no seemy romantic scenes that are so prevalent in today's drama novels. The novel itself is an easy read for anyone who wants to read about the ins and outs of business dealings, and the quirks of fate that can happen along the way"
4,Excellent book,I read this book maybe 50 years ago and for some reason thought of it recently so purchased it again and I'm glad I did. This is a really fun book especially after so long - it starts with comments about 80 cent breakfasts - a fantasy today! This is a great read and in spite of a 1955 setting is lots of fun.
5,Fabulous - a must for your collection,"The entire Hercules series was a slapstick, wacky and wonderfully serious (at times) portrayal of one of the world's greatest legends. This show is just super for all ages and while the fight scenes get a little old, they're still fun to watch because they put a lot of subtle comedy into each and every episode. Hercules offers us insights and layers of relevant issues in any time, plus a whole lot of fun. Good beats evil. Right beats wrong. Any questions?"
4,Final Season,"I love this show. The last season was short but worth buying on DVD. I would have given the show 5 stars if it has been a complete season, otherwise, I have no complaints."
3,Goddess Kali,Haven't watched these yet. But some of the dvds were scratched in the packet. I put them in the dvd player to see if they worked and they did. I love this series.
2,Not what it was advertised to be,"This book was listed as in ""very good"" condition, but the pages were very yellowed and started to fall out before I finished reading it. I would have bought it anyway had it been labeled ""fair"" condition, which it should have been, and then I would have expected the book to be in the condition it was in.Ed Roth"
1,Totally Unacceptable!,"I saw this movie on Showtime in FULL. It was great and a person could follow the story. This video version was put out by Artisan and the editing is HORRIBLE! From the 4 hours I saw on Showtime it was cut down to 2 hours on this video. It skipped back and forth in time that I forgot what I was watching. Some of the best scenes were cut out. How could they do this! I am very upset. This is not the same movie I saw on Showtime, they totally destroyed it!"
2,Self Serving Mush,"As a movie this wasn't bad (except for the worst performance I've ever seen by Martin Landau). Never having seen the original I can't comment on how it differs from the longer version, but the editing was ok & the story flowed & made sense.What was disturbing was the self-serving narrative taken from Bonanno's writing, that portrays him as a sensitive, honorable, decent, patriotic, religious & family man, whose was basically a businessman running the family business. There is nowhere any willingness to fess up to what he really was: a thug.The movie did give interesting insights into the real-life of the mafia."
1,BPA!!!,"Consider purchasing a different product, this juice is contained in plastic #7, one known for BPA and is widely told to avoid, especially for babies!!!"
1,They should be ashamed,#7 plastic bottles contain BPA. Very dangerous for people of all ages. Gerber products have been nothing but disappointing. Do not buy this!
4,Great for Travel,"I liked to use these for travel, just throw them in the diaper bag and go! I don't, however, think they are economical for everyday use. I wish they sold it in the big bottle. Instead I just buy a different brand of organic juice to drink at home that I purchase in a larger quantity."
5,Must read for true scholar of Cambodian History,"As one who has lived through the Khmer Rouge years, I find this work indispensable in trying to make sense of the actual working of the Khmer Rouge during those years. Although a bit dense for the average reader, I believe it is worth the extra time to sift through the voluminous materials presented in the book."
1,Intensely boring,"As a rule, I'll give a book 50 pages to get interesting. After that, I'll put it down.I went to 75 with this book and it still disappointed.It was excessively laden with detail and not light reading. Other documentaries (notably those by Iris Chang) have given a lot of historical detail and yet still were interesting and easy to read.I've not suitable alternatives to suggest, but I am not sure that at least one other book has been written that has been as boring as this one. And that's not because I've found that book, but because I'm pretty sure that no other book can be as boring as this one was."
5,Awsome Dance Remixes,"This was definitly not one of Debbie Harry's best songs but the remixes are nothing short of fantastic!!!! You will be very happy with this Maxi Single,,,Awsome!!!!!"
4,"Sayonara, Sugar!","This is a CD single of Deborah Harry's song, ""Sweet and Low"". It's a great song, but it wasn't a hit. The ""b-side"" is ""Lovelight"", which isn't a very good song."
5,Bioengineering goes awry,"The resulting saga is a brilliant hybrid of science fiction, adventure, social satire, political intrigue, and spiritual awakening. A bored, lonely housewife discovers that she has perceptive abilities that lead her to unexpected adventure and love. The battle finale is unlike any you've ever read. Rosetree's experience as an aura reader and empath, plus her incisive wit, make this novel a must-read in this age of awakening."
5,Awesome album!!!,"I was looking for this album for so long that I just can't believe I finally got it! Excellent hits compilation for 80's-90's music lovers.Thanks, Iron Maiden"
5,A Great Compilation,"If you like Richard Marx's music this is definitely the music compilation of choice. This wonderful cd has timeless rockers like ""Don't Mean Nothing"" and ""Satisfied"" along with sensational ballads like ""Right Here Waiting"" and ""Hold On To The Nights"". Marx's sweet children's song ""Angel's Lullaby"" is sure to be a hit with fans. This is a definitely a cd filled with songs that you can't pass up."
5,Bought it just for Keep Coming Back,"I have always liked Richard Marx since I was in Junior High & High School and we danced to his songs at dances. But Keep coming Back is the song that holds a special place in my heart. Every party I went to my sophmore year someone would pop in a tape of mixes and this song was on it at most of them. Well after almost a year of flirting he finally asked me to dance and it was to this song and then he kissed me. Although we were only together for 4 months & I don't know where he is now, I always think of him when I hear this."
5,Awesome,Everything you always wanted and more if you are a fan of the 80's and 90's. You only have to get this one cd to m ake your collection complete. I recommend this to anyone who needs a good dose of music!
5,Greatest Hits,He has the greatest hits anyone could ever have! He is the best singer/songwriter ever! I also like how he wrote a song for his sons and put it on this collecton. I can't wait for his next five or six albums so he can have other greatest hits album. That should be something! Get all of his albums!
5,"Well written soulful lyrics, listen closely","A remarkably well written, soulful set of lyrics, insightful and emotional, perfect for reflection."
5,The best soft rock artist of all time!!,"If you love soft rock then you will love this cd. It includes all of Richard Marx best songs unlike lots of other greatest hits cd's which leave out a lot of favorites. This cd has every song from Angelia to Right Here Waiting, which by the way is the best song. Worth checking out and buying if soft rock is your cup of tea."
4,Satisfied.,"There was a time when ""Richard Marx"" could do no wrong. He put out ""rockers"" for the guys, and ballads for the girls. His songs were played at a thousand school dances, and in as many car tape-decks. This is as good as a collection from him could be. I can't think of one song missing. As much as ""Don't Mean Nothin'"" and ""Right Here Waiting"" take you back to the late 80's, I actually like some of his later stuff more. ""Keep Coming Back"" is a very smooth and mature song from him, and my favorite song is probably ""Hazard"". That songs story is just an excellent and moving piece of music. In short, this is THE cd of his to have for those ""Endless Summer Nights""."
4,slim mints yum,I bought these to help me to continue to lose weight and to keep me from gaining while I quit smoking. I have changed my eating habits to healthy but the mints just seem to give that extra push over the plateau. When ever I want a cig I just eat a mint.
1,doesn't do a thing but taste good,did not help me to lose weight or curb my appetite. Good-tasting mint though.
3,First one is better...,"Like everybody else is commenting, go out and buy the first one. After listening to the first one you'll be very tempted to buy this one, but try to borrow it first and see if you like it. Had I listened to it before purchasing it I may not have brought it. It's not a bad album though, but some songs are too long and repetitive and I'm not much into techno.. I guess that's why I liked the first one so much, it didn't have as much techno. Well, this one is really cool too. They are the best soundtracks to relax and go to bed with. I highly recommend the first one before getting this one though. You won't have any regrets."
3,The true die hard Trainspotting fan,"If you do consider your self one, than this is it. You got the book, the movie, the CD. All that is left is this. Even if you don't its got a lot of good song."
2,Like most second volumes...,"This one loses the momentum of the first. What needed to be said and sung was said and sung on the first soundtrack. This one is not bad. Just not relevant.You can listen to the whole thing all the way through and maybe even enjoy it. You won't get any sense of continuity or relation to the film, however. I liked the inclusion of Habanera from Carmen... and ""Temptation"" from Fun Boy Three, but overall I could have spent this money better elsewhere. (Maybe the opera Carmen would have been a better investment!)"
2,"music, but not trainspotting fans","Ok, I guess. No way close to Trainspotting #1, Iggy Pop n'all. Hardly listen to it. Too electronic & rave for me!"
3,Anything is almost better than nothing,"Already available at walmart 9-1-11 bought for 15$ - I hate releases that are thrown together, But as far as content,is the best we could hope for. Can't get enough of the classics though- Keep 'em coming."
1,I'm FURIOUS. This is an outrage.,"Look, I've purchased the other four DVDs in this series, and all of the Golden Collection sets, and based on the packaging and the series' history, this should have been 15 classic WB Roadrunner cartoons. I should have read the reviews. But I didn't bother, because it looked just like the other Looney Tunes Superstars dvds. Well, I'm a sucker, because I now own a DVD that I would sooner fling out the window than watch. These are new cartoons, for the most part. And while they are lovely, I don't want them. Thanks, guys.I'll be paying closer attention to your Looney Tunes dvd releases from here on out, WB. I won't be fooled twice."
1,Where's the Acme Business Bureau?,"Warner Home Video has done it again with this upcoming bottom-of-the-barrel release. The Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote are poorly served in these 1965-66 travesties directed by Rudy Larriva. Apart from ""Chariots of Fur"" (1994), there is no Chuck Jones in sight. For Looney Tunes completists only!"
1,Absolutus Ripusoffus Crapabillius !,"This is Blasphemy at the highest level !As a devoted ""Classic"" Looney Tunes connoisseur.I have bought virtually every Looney Tunes Original cartoon available ,especially the Brilliant 6 volumes Golden Collection dvd set. I ordered this computer generated abomination as a pre order last year ,So I naturally expected it to be the same class as previous ""Looney Tunes Super Stars"" series The Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny ,Sylvester and Foghorn Leghorn editions are great ,As they are the original 1940'S ,50'S ETC Cartoons.These 15 so called ""CLASSICS"" are not even listed in the Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies bible by Jerry Beck and Will Friewald.The fact that there is no warning on either the casing or the dvd is a disgrace.Sadly there are very few original Road runner Coyote classic on dvd ,Hopefully Warner Bros will wake up to themselves and apologise to all and sundry ..It's Disssspicable !Disturbed from Downunder !"
4,DVD for children,Brought these for my grandchildren for Christmas and three others and They loved it. I recommend them for anyone. Even I liked them
2,this was NOT the classic road runner i was hopeing for,"this was NOT the classic road runner that i know an love..i would send it back, but my 4 yr old is okay with it.."
1,JUST NOT WORTH IT,"I SAW THIS AT WAL-MART FOR 15.00. LOOKING AT THE CONTENTS,I DECIDED IT WAS NOT EVEN WORTH 15 CENTS. NONE OF THE MATERIAL WAS CLASSIC. They COULDhave had a RALPH VS.SAM cartoon. They COULD have had a BUGS VS. WILE E cartoon. BUT THEY DIDN'T. THEY REALLY BLEW IT THIS TIME!"
1,Not the REAL roadrunner cartoons,Warner Bros should have never released this collection of non-Chuck Jones roadrunner cartoons. These are some of the worst cartoons ever made. Don't buy this DVD.
1,Warner Bros should be ashamed.,"Of all of the recent Super Stars releases this is the worst and most misleading. To include NO classic toons is completely crass.9 of these selections come from the mid-to-late 60s when Warner had already shut down its animation division and production was farmed out to Depatie-Freleng. Chuck Jones was no longer involved, the music and animation is cheap and the toons are just pale imitations of the truly classic ones from the 50s.Worst of all, they are not funny. Totally worthlessThe revival cartoons from the 90s and 00s are much better and the couple of CGI ones are actually very funny but still not the original classics from the 40s and 50s you should expect. They are the only reason this even gets one star."
1,Revisionist BS,"This DVD comes on like a collection of classic RoadRunner/WileECoyote films. It is not. It contains new productions that look like a Super Mario Bros. 3D game. The characters have that sort of smirk that 3D animations often do, and it completely takes away the humor. The production has none of the pizzazz of the originals. I was so grossed out I couldn't even watch the whole thing."
4,"4 1/2 Stars. Cant wait for Bedlam in Goliath, this wil hold u over till then","this album feels like its half as good as a TMV album, which is still amazing. didnt care much for the distant noises on the first two tracks but the rest of the album has enough energy to jumpstart my car. ""Rapid fire tollbooth"" is one of my favorite tracks, which will be reworked for the upcoming TMV album Bedlam in Goliath under the title ""Goliath"". Just be sure to crank it up on the last track as you're eyes are rolling in the back of your head.peace, enjoy"
2,Dust Mop heads,I thought I was getting the Bona brand mop head. I have a Bona dust mop and it cleans the floors of almost every particle of dust and lint.This mop head does OK but not as good as the Bona fiber. I'm disappointed.
4,Not the best interview,"While all interviews of the gretest band of all time are good, their are better ones than this. I like it, but the information contained within is a little too ""common"". A good buy, but look a little more before making up yuour mind."
3,I shot an arrow.....,"I have just finished reading ""The Crooked Stick"" and have found it an interesting if pedantic history of the great English long bow (the deadliest military weapon of its day) and the general field of archery since that time. I now know more about archery than I ever did but was left wanting more. I would like to see a greatly expanded glossary and index. Soar seems to be writing to the archery crowd who are already familiar with arcane archery terms, but the general reader is left in a bit of a fog."
2,Disappointing,"Expecting a book on the impact of the long bow on warfare I was very disappointed as the book dealt mostly with the history of the bow itself, construction, material etc. Half the book deals with the development of recreational use of the bow. This book is not recommended if your interest is military history."
2,Blah,"Evidently most of the history of the long bow happend after 1500. Very useful if you are interested in British longbow societys. If you are interested in the crooked stick, it's not very good at all."
5,Excelente Libro.,"Es fascinante, es tan entretenido el libro que lo lei solo en tres dias y es mas de 300 paginas, la forma de escribir, te mantiene entretenido, que mas se le puede pedir a DON FRANCISCO (REY de las COMUNICACIONES y del MARKETING) .... 100% Interesante."
3,Humm What Can i say,"This album was So-So Lust For life,Cirque De La Lune, and How do you fell right now where great. But The Rest where Sorry as hell if you want a album with Only 3great Songz get it.If Not dont"
4,Good thrash metal,"This CD is very well done and is surprisingly strong for a newer band. The music is awesome and contained some great breakdowns. The album does get somewhat repetitive in the latter part. What I mean by latter part is after Malice in Wonderland (track 6). Starting with 55/23, the songs start to resemble the ones at the beginning of the disc and the listener begins to wonder ""Where have I heard that before?"" But this CD is definitely worth adding to your collection. Winter Solstice is definitely the top thrash metal band out right now."
5,This an awesome cd!!!,"First off I would like to say that it makes me very sad that they got a new vocalist, I have not heard there new one yet, but the guy that is doing vocals on this cd sounds really cool. I think he sounds like a walrus, anyways this is a great cd and you should definitely buy it. In case you are wondering the guys in this band are all good Christians although they do not openly advertise it. Buy this cd, it is one of a kind."

1,I still hate this book,"I had to rate this a second time because my one star rating only reduced the overall rating (it's been reviewed by one other reader) to a two and a half and that's two and a half too many.I feel like a chump for buying it, but I'm happy admitting my mistake to the world if it could save one helpless soul from having to read paragraphs like...:""The book as a whole, then, is not treelike in structure. It is not an arborescence. Instead it takes the form of a rhizomatic network. It makes overlaps and juxtapositions, and it makes interference effects as a result of making these overlaps. So that is the fourth way of introducing the book. It is about writing fractionally."" - p. 9 John Law, Aircraft Stories.You really don't want to know about other three ways of introducing the book. I was struggling during the first two, the third had me gasping for air and number four was kinda it for me."
3,Overpriced,$15.99 is too much for this simple and small lawn mower blade but what can you do. Home Depot sells the mower but not the blade. Maybe somebody should give the management a drug test.
5,Great Gadget,"This works exactly as advertized. It keeps coffee hot all day...great for big dinner parties. I would buy it again, & from Amazon"
1,Don't know about this product...,"It was packed so poorly by Amazon that it came completely shattered and had to be returned. Looked nice, though..."
5,Excellent Product,"I was a little hesitant to believe that this air pot could keep liquids hot for a long period of time. I did a test at home before taking the pot to the office. I used water that ws just barely boiling. 17 hours later, the water was still steaming!!! I was/am very impressed. This is a great must have for a small office. I am very glad I decided to make this purchase."
3,A fluke?,"When I broke my last Zojirushi air pot, which I had used daily for over 10 years, I immediately went searching for an identical replacement. I found it on Amazon and ordered it. But I'm disappointed because my coffee isn't staying as hot in this one for nearly as long as it did in my original one. I don't know if this is a lemon or if the product isn't of the same quality as it was before ... though it looks identical. I may buy another some day, but I'll be wondering about it when I do."
2,"Cookbook is ok, but could be better","I like the idea of this book, but it uses a lot of vegetarian foods that I don't particularly care for. Great for a start up vegetarian, or for a seasoned one, but not really for me. I kept the book, but will edit them more to my liking."
4,Easy receipes,I purchased this book for my daughter who is onthe South Beach Diet.She loves it and has not had to purchase any extra ingredients to make the meals. Her husband is a picky eater and he has been pleased with all the meals she has prepared.
3,Low Carb Cookbook,It wasn't as good a book as I thought it was going to be--the price was good and I received it on time and the seller was good--book was in good condition too. Contents of book wasn't that great OK but not great.
3,It was acceptable,"I'm not really raving about this item. There was a whole lot of ""open up this can"" and ""open up that can"". The entree section was its saving grace. I liked it because there was no guessing at the nutritional value. All values were located at the bottom of each recipe and meals are actually being prepared with kitchen appliances and not a can opener."
4,Test Drive Unlimited tour,"This game has evolutionated a lot since 1985 when the first ""test drive"" appeared to the PC, Now it is very similar to the ""Gran Turismo"" series which allows you buying a small and cheap car and to start earning money in order to obtain better cars and houses."
3,"Good introduction to musical notation, but not really mandolin","This book is good for people who do not know how musical notation. It introduces all of the scales, and key signatures, basic music theory. However there was no description of how to pick, exercises in chords, rhythm. I already play the violin, and basically you could just as well play everything in the on the violin, so this book did not add any ""mandolin"" knowledge."
1,Keep Looking -- Don't Buy This Book,"Dreamweaver 4, when Macromedia released Dreamweaver UltraDev in 2000? Even the title to this book is antiquated!There are glimmers of hope in this book, but then those bright spots are snuffed out by incorrect instructions and grammatical errors that makes for difficult reading.Added to this is the fact that a book on Dreamweaver without comprehensive coverage of the UltraDev components is very anemic."
4,Here comes the 21st Century!,"""I Want That Man"" is a single by Deborah Harry that was released in 1989. It's a dance song that was written by the Thompson Twins. It's a great song that was a flop in the U.S., although it did manage to become a #13 hit in the U.K. There are three mixes of the song: a 12"" version, the single version and an instrumental version. The ""b-side"" of the single is the punkish ""Bike Boy"". Both songs are from the albumDef, Dumb & Blonde. Here is the track listing:1. I Want That Man (12"" remix)2. I Want That Man (remix/edit)3. Bike Boy (CD version)4. I Want That Man (instrumental)"
3,Good Stuff,"I bought this microSD card originally for my CU500 phone, and it didn't work, even though the handbook that came with the phone claimed that it could handle cards up to 1g. So I bought another one (512mg), and it worked on the phone. I just use this card as a back up for music on my flash mp3 player. It works great, and transfers are incredibly fast with the card and adapter included. It got a 3 because of not serving it's intended purpose. I hope this helped"
2,Be careful,"My adapter has problems with the write-protection lock. Most of the time, it will be write protected when plugged into the adapter, regardless of the lock position. You just have to plug and unplug until it works right.I contacted Kingston about the issue and got no response... but it DOES work, after a fashion, so what the hell."
2,Beware of compatability!,"I bought this card to use with my LG CU-500 phone but imagine my surprise when it didn't work! My local Cingular store let me try a SanDisk 1GB card which worked fine. I ended up having to return this item due to the compatability issue, so beware!"
5,Great Deal for the money,"I bought this card to use in my Motorola KRZR cell phone. It is very affordable, and offers more than enough storage space for what I need it for; storing short video clips and MP3s. Also, I can now transfer files from my phone to my computer (or vice-versa) without paying for Motorola's over-priced software.With the included full-size SD adapter, I can use the card in my camera or Wii in a pinch."
3,1GB Kingston MicroSD Not Supported for LG CU500 Phone,"I was not able to get my LG CU500 phone to read the Kingston card. I called LG and they said the phone only supported SanDisk MicroSD cards. With the adapter, it's still usable as a standard SD card so I just plan to use it in my digital camera. The card seems OK as I can write to it from computer."
4,Great card but Win XP warning,"This card works great in the phone I bought it for. Unfortunately my built-in card reader on my Windows XP Professional machine doesn't recognize it. It shows up as a mounted drive but trying to access it with Explorer yields a ""Please insert a disk into drive"" message.I bought a SanDisk USB multi card reader thinking that perhaps my card reader (works with other SD cards but I haven't tried it with 1GB+ cards) was going bad. No luck.The card (and SanDisk USB multi-card reader) work just fine in Linux (Ubuntu 6.10). So I move files to and from the card with that. But if you don't have that option... beware. I believe it's a Windows XP issue with SD cards > 1 GB but buyer beware."
5,"Great Deal, Better Value","This card works flawlessly, and is the most competitively priced I've seen anywhere. I couldn't be happier with this product."
1,Does NOT work with LG CU500 phone,"Title says it all, don't buy for use with an LG CU500 phone.Kingston is aware of the problem and unable/unwilling to fix it."
3,A 3 only because ...,it's just a memory card. It saves all I need on my phone. Doesn't do anything spectacular or weird (like erasing data).
4,Worked but...,Everything was cool but I got charged twice for it so I don't know if it was amazon or them...but it did get fixed about a week later...
3,Ive seen better,"Although this card works relatively fine it is not up to the standards that some cards are. This card is manufactured in Taiwan, and has an inferior speed than those manufactured in Japan. If you are looking for good quality this is a card you might want to skip."
3,Unable to use for primary purpose.,"The card communicated well with my computer, but was unrecognizable by my mobile phone, which was the sole purpose of this purchase."
1,Garmin GPS Mapping Memory,Purchased the card to replace the 64MB card that came with my Garmin 60CSx handheld GPS navigation system. No problems with receipt of the card and the standard SD sleeve makes it readily tranferrable to other devices.
5,Used for Phone,"I got this for my sister's MP3 player phone. It wasn't an LG Chocolate, I forget what kind she has, but it was the second card I bought for her, and this one works great!"
5,What a Deal!,I search everywhere for the most memory at the best price. I finally found it at amazon.com. You couldn't beat the deal anywhere else and believe me I looked. The product itself is very good quality and holds alot of music for my mp3 player.
4,Great product for a great price!,Seller was very quick in shipping order and item was just as explained in description. Great way to get this item for cheaper then any retail store I have seen. Would buy from this seller again.
1,NO,"did not work with anything.wouldnt connect with my computer, & only error messages with cell phone, camera, pda.not reccomended.I would rather go to walmart and pay $21 for a 1GB there.Ya thanks."
5,1GB MicroSD Memory Card,This is a great deal! The Item was shipped fast and as soon as I got it I was able to plug it into my phone and start using it.
4,Works well - good deal for the money,I've been using this microSD card regularly - there's no difference in performance from any of the other well known products. And it's cheaper (at least I got it cheaper). No reason not to buy it.
5,1 GB Kingston MicroSD memory card with adapter,"The order arrived promptly and without problems. I formatted the 1 GB card in my LG EnV telephone; using my computer, I converted a CD to an MP3 file; then downloaded the MP3 file to the memory card via the adapter. I now have the contents of the CD on the memory card, which works perfectly in my LG EnV telephone. A very good buy!"
5,"Great, cheap micro SDs","Why buy in the store when you can get them so cheap here on Amazon? They charge $40 for 1GB in the stores!!I have two, works in both KRZR k1m and LG-ENV."
1,A blind Product,"This Product only works for some phones like the Samsung SGH-D807 and not for the LG CU500 as far as I know by testing it myself. I bought this memory card only to find out that it does not work with my cell phone. I called the Kingston company for an exchange according to their life time warranty, but after speaking with 1 of their rude costumer service representatives, he said that there is no Micro SD card that works with LG CU500 phones. I will not be buying Kinston Product again. They should clearly create a compatible list of products that works with theirs."
4,Very Good MicroSD card,"These were very good SD cards for the price, haven't had a problem with them and they seem to be the japanese ones, which are pretty fast as well."
5,Couldn't ask for more.,Fast Shpping combined with a great value! Would buy from again. Buy with confidence. Wouldn't shop anywhere else for a MicroSD FLCARD.Thanks 5 STARS!!!!
2,Adapter did not work.,"Adapter did not work, however card worked in my cell phone, but not my Son's, Kingston has a great return program and they sent a new one set at no extra charge, had to deal with Fedex, though."
2,not so good,"this product it so complicated, becoz this product cant put like song, picture or something else with phone, it must be use the PC for put the songs, pictures ar something else."
2,Good Product Bad Service!,"I purchased the 1GB Kingson Micro SD from BlueProton Consulting (troug Amazon). On their seller's profile BlueProton lists shipping rates of $4.00/shipment. My order was charged $11.90 eventhough it was only the microSD card to ship!?! I sen an email requiring more information and/or explanation - no replies what so ever. I didn't receive a cnofirmation e-mail, tracking info for the shipment - nothing. It seems that those guys are too busy making money and they don't care about their customers. Well they just lost me as one. I'll never buy from BlueProton Consulting anymore!Other than that the card work fine so far with my Cingular 8525"
1,incompatible,"This card is observed to not work in an LG model CU500 cellphone.Before purchasing a Micro SD memory card, the wise buyer will go to the vendor's web page to confirm compatibility."
1,DOA,"After reading the other reviews here, I'm guessing I just got unlucky. Mine arrived and did not work at all in my RAZR V3i. It was very cheap, so I went to the store and got one that was on sale locally, which worked fine.Phone said card wasn't readable, wouldn't let me format it or anything. My experience wasn't great, but like I said it sounds like I was the exception."
3,No English Subtitles,"Buyers should be warned that the DVD has NO English subtitles, and all extras are in printed Spanish (except for a couple of photographs).I think calling this DVD ""absolutely unwatchable"" is a bit extreme, however the video quality is uneven. It's particularly bad during any panning shots - possibly due to the digital compression methods used."
1,Worthless DVD,"The elements exist to create a pristine copy of this film. I've seen it in 35mm and it's Buñuel's masterpiece, and it has been well preserved. This copy however is absolutely unwatchable and worthless."
3,Modelado dinámico,"Este libro hace una descripción de las máquinas eléctricas, de manera tal de que se puedan modelar para poder estudiar la estabilidad de la máquina y del sistema en el cual está funcionando.Es una herramienta para el ingeniero, porque cada vez necesita más estudiar la dinámica del sistema, para poder aprovechar al máximo cada elemento."
2,wHERE'S THE PEANUT BUTTER?,I liked ginger cookies but these cookies had bad texture and not enough peanut butter flavor
1,gluten free peanut butter cookies,"Peanut butter Cookies: Yeach. the pecan shortbread cookies are so wonderful and these had 5 stars beside them, so I ordered a case. nobody will eat them-- they're rubbery. I'm surprised because most of Pamela's products are so tasty.Chocolate Chunk Pecan Shortbread: These are WONDERFUL, gluten free cookies. The only problem is, and it's a BIG PROBLEM, that they were shipped in a tiny, tight box and so they were all in crumbles by the time they arrived! Had Amazon packed them in a larger box and used bubble wrap OR the plastic air bags they often package with, the cookies would likely not have crumbled. So disappointed, because these are GOOD COOKIES."
3,Hiatt Bird Bath Dripper,"Product ordered was not available from the seller, and a more expensive and ornate substitute was provided. Good customer service by seller, but the substitute does not function properly. There is no way to get the tubing to stay attached to the pump unit - pressure blows it off even when attached with a hose clamp."
5,Money Well Spent,"Awesome product for the price. Easy to install, easy to operate. Perfect for giving my newfoundland baths! I would absolutely recommend this purchase to anyone."
5,Lucio Speaks a Universal Language,"You don't have to be Italian to appreciate Lucio Battisti's extraordinary musical talent. I was introduced to his genius while I was married to my late husband, Rodolfo Ceccherini, who grew up listening to Lucio. His voice can be haunting, melancholy, and altogether dazzling. Even without knowing the lyrics you can identify with the message his music and voice convey. A song like ""Una Vita Viva"" immediately put you in an up-beat frame of mind. Love songs such as ""Gelosa Cara"" and ""Questo Amore"" touch your heart with Lucio's emotional intensity. Listen to this CD whenever you want to be transported to Lucio's magical realm."
1,motion pro tapper feeler,this is handy but extremely delicate.bent one slightly to fit and snapped off.luckily not in the engine.recommend you make youre own.
4,Ray of Sunshine,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this, hadn't heard anything off the album itself.It's simply wonderful[[ASIN:B0000584XS Raisins in the Sun]Candy from A Stranger and Glen and Stone are the standouts for me.Buy it if you're a fan of Chuck Prophet"
4,this album is so easy to love,"I picked up this album because when I saw Chuck Prophet play Jules Shear joined him to sing ""Chicken Fried""...it's got an infectious groove. The album is great start to finish. Great hip shaking on ""Chicken Fried"", great lyrics on ""Let go now"" and some great harmonies between Chuck And Jules. It seems like there's a song for every mood. Definitely a gem in the rough."
4,Solid final release,"The final release from Boston's In My Eyes, this album is definitely good, and indicative of where the band could have gone had they not broken up. If you like the whole youth crew revival thing, pick this up."
2,Two Stars- At least For A Four Year Old,"At less than 90 minutes, this is one of the LONGEST movies I have ever seen.The movie is cute, and the message is good, but I was asked ""Is it almost over yet?"" by my four year old son before we were even 15 minutes into the movie.There's just not a whole lot to keep anyone's interest here.I really wanted to like this movie. I love Elmo. Maybe it's for children even younger than my four year old."
1,Not for the sensitive toddler.,"I agree with some other reviewers that this is not for the more sensitive child. The singing is very loud. My two year old was afraid of the vilian and began to cry halfway through. We too had to calm her down by showing her another Elmo DVD to let her know that Elmo was okay! I'm not sure of the age rating for this movie, but I wouldn't show it to kids under three, especially if they are sensitive."
2,Not for emotional toddlers!!!,"My 2-1/2 year old loves Elmo (is very attached to him), so I rented this at our local video store. She also becomes very upset when someone she likes is upset.Five minutes into the movie we turned it off, with my toddler in hysterical tears due to the nature of the movie (Elmo's blanket gets stolen). She was only consoled by watching her Elmo's World DVD instead, where he wasn't sad.I'd recommend caution on this movie if your toddler is the emotional type."
1,Disney-fied pablum with great performers at their worst,"I hate to give a bad review of this one, because I admire the work of many of the people in it. However, if you're looking for entertainment that's educational, this isn't it.This video is a single aphorism stretched out to movie length. Although I liked some performances (Joey Mazzarino as the bug,) and some songs (the STOMP - inspired song at the laundromat) the big picture was completely ignored in this video. I can't stand when children's performers talk down to kids, and this movie does that in spades..."
5,Elmo in Grouchland,"No problems at all. Very acceptable. My son enjoyed playing this VHS. This product very helpful as he has no problem with VHS tapes, which at times are difficult to purchase."
3,Good opening song,"My son is 20 months and so far he is only interested in the first 10 minutes or so - the opening scene of Elmo in his bedroom and the song ""Together Forever"". He isn't interested in anything after the laundromat scene. But he really loves the first scene when Elmo leans forward and ""sees"" the audience and says hello. He will point at Elmo's blanket when he is looking for it. I think the ""Together forever"" song is cute and find myself humming it. Maybe when my son is older he will like the rest although some people think the ""evil"" parts might teach kids the wrong thing. But kids need to see what's bad and learn that its bad and how to deal with bad people."
5,A great childrens movie,I thought that this movie was a great childrens movie. Me and my brother loved it(and were pre-teens) it is soooo cute!
2,not for the very young,"We bought this video because my 2 and a half year old is a huge Elmo fan. The opening song, ""together forever"" is great as is the scene in the laundrymat, ala STOMP. But then my son gets completely turned off. In fact when Elmo gets sucked into Grouchland, my son got scared. The bad guy is really mean to Elmo and we never get past the first 10 minutes or so of this movie before my son leaves the room. What a disappointment. I think that this is a movie for older children, unlike most of the other Sesame DVDs that we have. As I read other reviews, the very positive ones are from older kids. We will see if my son changes his mind when he is a bit older."
2,My 17 Month Old Cried!! :(,"We popped this movie in and my little guy sat down to watch it... he usually doesn't sit still for more than a few minutes of television - but he loves Elmo, so he sat and watched until the Mean Huxley took Elmo's Blanket. At this point he broke out into tears - He's only 17 months... but I would guess many children could react this way. I had to fast forward the movie to the part where Elmo got his blanket back before he stopped crying. Now he asks to take HIS blanket out of his crib when he gets up - he never did this before watching the movie.I don't reccommend it to little ones who might get frightened."
2,Becareful! May not be suitable for toddlers.,"I thought this movie would be a lot of fun for my 2 year old who loves Elmo. I was having fun watching it in the beginning, and wish I could have seen the entire movie. However, about 15 minutes through Elmo encounters a ""scary"" helicoptor, and a villian who takes away his blanket. My daughter burst into tears. I could only console her by skipping to the end to show that Elmo got his blanket back. Two weeks after viewing she is still talking about the scary helicoptor and mean man. She, of course, would not let me put the movie in again, no matter how I assured her it was just silly and not scary."
2,Too scary for some children,I bought this movie for my daughter when she was 2 1/2. She has always loved Elmo. We did not make it through the first few minutes because she was in hysterics when elmo was loosing his blanket. I recently tried it again now that she is 4 and she still can't handle the stress of this movie. I think that she just identifies with Elmo so much and she is just so worried about him. She litterly sobbed and called out Elmo's name. I am sure it is fine for some kids... but not if your child is very sensitive like mine. I will be giving this movie away. She has never had a reaction like this to any other movie.
1,"Nasty, Gross Out ""Humor"" Avoid.","This movie is full of disgusting belching and farting, a queen actting like she's having an orgasm when the audience goes 'pplllhh' and more. If you are okay with your child watching this, by all means buy it. I'll have to admitt my 20 month old liked this movie, but Im affraid it is going to 'get lost' somewhere. A shame too, as the movie starts out really cute. It is IMHO an insult to the previous muppet movies."
1,bad,bad movie idea. not great like the elmo show on sesame street. should have never been made. don't buy!
3,Too Scary,"It is not a bad movie overall, but it was WAY too scary for my 3 1/2 year old. I thought that an Elmo movie would be a slam dunk, but yikes! She had a death grip on her dad's neck for the whole movie and was almost in tears several times. She didn't want to turn it off and I thought that it would be best for her to see that it was OK in the end, so we watched the whole thing. She doesn't want to watch it again, though..."
4,15 month old loves it,"I've read other reviews and, yes, the garbage queen does get to excited by ""rasberries."" I blame that on bad direction and I really don't think it's suppose to be inappropriate, nor do I think it will scar my child. The movie does a good job of slowing things down when they may be getting too intense (enter Bert and Ernie). Also, Elmo is quick to realize that new situations might be suprising at first but soon learns it's fun. He does far more laughing at new adventures than screaming. My child loves this movie and I think it's appropriate. Compared to a Disney movie (Nemo comes to mind), this is far more gentle and encouraging."
5,Cute movie great for elmo lovers,This is a silly movie great for elmo lovers.I can watch it with my son and not be bored out of my mindgreat creative characters and who doesnt love our furry red friend elmo?I think it is rather expensive but it will also get good use in our home on my kindle for road trips and fussy baby moments.I picked one movie that I was going to buy him and this was it and am happy with my choice.I like that it has some songs in it as my son LOVES songs :)
4,THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND!,"Watch as ELMO, the fuzzy red muppet from SESAME STREET, loses his favorite BLUE BLANKET and heads off into the big scary world to find it! Even if it means heading into GROUCHLAND itself! This is the first feature-length movie starring Elmo and there is probably not a thing anybody can do to stop it from being the last! MANDY PATINKIN and VANESSA WILLIAMS help Elmo in his quest! This is a movie for the kiddies and not for the young at heart! This movie will only drive older people up the wall! But the little ones will be ENTRANCED for hours! Just do not let them see the ""Making Of"" segment on this DVD or they might be upset by the fact Elmo is not real!"
4,Lots of fun,"Our 2 year-old daughter adores Elmo like just about every other toddler I know. This movie is fun for any Elmo fan and our daughter enjoys it quite a bit. I must say, however, that I don't feel the film is quite up to the high standard of the best Sesame Street work. ""Elmo Saves Christmas"", for example, is more entertaining and well-written. And the songs in ""Grouchland"" aren't particularly memorable or touching like the earlier Sesame classics of Joe Raposo, etc. The film is, however, better than 99 percent of the children's videos out there and I'd definitely recommend it."
2,Not a winner in our house.,"My 3 year old son likes Elmo but, he absolutely hates this video. When he asks to watch a video, he specifically states, ""but not Grouchland."" His Mother and I found it to be mildly entertaining for adults (unlike that horrible Thomas and the Magic Railroad which, of course, my son loves). Maybe, as he gets older, he will like it. That is, if he will ever let us put it on again."
2,too scarey for a 1yr old,"I should have watched this first before popping it into the car dvd player...about 15-20 minutes into it she started crying and saying NO NO ELMO NO! She was very effected, maybe next year she will like it more. We have a couple other Elmo videos that we love, not this one though."
4,12 month Elmo fan,My 12 month old loves Elmo. Whenever we start watching this movie her eyes just light up. The only thing I would say is that maybe a older child would be scared or bothered by the movie. It's also kind of weird how sexy Vanessa Williams part is in this movie. I thought the movie was entertaining.
5,Elmo was a hit!!,I ordered this for my 1 year old for Christmas. I received on Christmas Eve. Thanks so much for the quick delivery. This is my son's favorite movie.
4,My toddler loves this Elmo movie!,"This was a total surprise for us. My toddler watches a number of Elmo videos, but he seems to like this one best. It has an actual story that teaches a good lesson about sharing. Most importantly, when things get a little scary or sad in the movie, the reel stops and Ernie and Bert talk your child through the scene. The music is very enjoyable, and my two-year-old is fascinated with the characters. There is a risk that the lesson of not saying ""mine, mine, mine"" might be lost on a child so young. But the movie has captivated my son."
1,Your kids will cry,2 of my kids watched this. my daughter is 2 and my son is 5. they both cried hysterically when elmo lost his blankie. it's too traumatic for kids.
4,I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT MESSAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is for Leigh Deacon from Watertown, MA....I am a mother of one! And my boy is very smart and knows what it is to share at 19 months old! I feel you should not blame The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland for your child's hunger to be greedy! It is a Great Film!!!!!!!!!!You explained you started having a problem with your son when he was 26 months old with the MINE and not sharing!!!.....Well my point is that you should have tought him the value of sharing way before he was over 2 years old!!!! And maybe he wouldn't of had the problem with MINE!!! I think he just paid attention to the wrong part of the film and tought himself a different way to Not Share!!! Don't ever under estimate a child.....even very young children....they are SMART! And if you teach them right and as early as possible....then you will not have a problem!This Film is the best film!!!! It's great for all children!"
4,"My Sister Liked It, But I'm Not Sure About It","My nine and a half year old sister LOVED this video since she was an all-time Elmo queen, but I wasn't positive about it. Like Barney's Great Adventure, there were a lot of swears and fights. If we had picked a different Sesame Street video, I would have suggested Follow That Bird instead of this disgusting video."
1,Too Scary!! (even for brave kids),"This video was purchased for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas by his Grandma. She even bought a VHS version for her house so he could watch it at either place. The sole reason she selected this video was because of the title character. Yes, my son is a full fledged member of the ELMO fan club, like many children his age are. We soon found out that Grandma wasted her money...BIG TIME. The movie is a bit strange to say the least, and a little on the psychadelic side. The most disturbing part is when the ""evil"" character arrives in Grouchland via helicopter. This is when my son BEGS me to turn it off and says ""It scares me, mommy."" (while covering his ears) It didn't take us long to figure out that this was not the video for him!! It was heartbreaking when I saw the fear in his little face. With the typical daredevil little boy personality, we were surprised at his reaction and both Grandma and I wished we had previewed the video before we let him watch it!"
5,My 2yr old LOVES this movie,"Regardless of the recent events with Mr. Clash, Elmo is still a household name in our home. My daughter dances to the songs and frequently requests the ""Elmo movie!"" I'll admit, I find myself getting into it too! Cute story and well done."
1,bad moral,"Who doesn't love Elmo?! Everyone loves Elmo. Well, As a parent, I saw a selfish Elmo that cared only for himself and hurt others and cause much pain. This is a terrible movie for kids to learn from. No one even addressed the selfishness that got Elmo in grouchland in the first place. Not a good thing for kids to watch. Poor movie from Sesame Street."
5,He would watch it all day.,"My oldest two children had no interest in the movie. My third is more or less glued to the screen when I play it. The way he let me cut his hair while he watched it was worth the money alone. Mandy Patinkin is hysterical, even from the point of view of an adult.The only downside is that I am thoroughly sick of it, since I don't normally watch movies eighty-five times in a row."
1,What I Thought About Elmo in Grouchland,It was the worst movie I had ever seen in my life. I saw it at the movies with a friend and my mom. It was so bad that we left before it was even half over!
1,Didn't make it through 10 minutes,"My two year old son is an avid Elmo watcher. He can't get enough of the furry red guy. This movie seemed like a natural to add to our growing DVD children's collection. That's why I was completely shocked that my son was ""traumatized"" by this story. Elmo's blanket gets torn when he is reluctant to share with his friend. This scene sent my son into hysterics. Elmo's blankie happened to look exactly like my son's and we had to locate his blankie and make sure it was okay. Once he was calmed down I continued the movie. The following scene shows Elmo's blanket falling into Oscar's can and subsequently being sucked through a ""do not open"" door. My normally outgoing, and well adjusted son broke into shrieks once again. That's where we ended the movie. My son has no attachment to a bottle or pacifier, but he loves his blankie. The content of this movie may be too upsetting for a child with a similar love object."
1,Beware,"My Daughter may need therapy after viewing this hectic mess! I am being facetious but, she is almost two years old and one of her first words was Elmo. After seeing him mad, falling down, and yelling at his friends, we had to play an Elmo music DVD to ensure that he was OK. I do not recommend this for young children, especially those who live in homes where chaos is not the norm. She simply was not used to all the activity displayed here. My Daughter is not timid - she is quite the opposite but, she would cry out Elmo's name at every scene that showed Elmo in a compromising situation, not knowing if he was upset or hurt. Actually, I'm not sure if this film is good for older children either, based on what I've seen. 0 stars."
5,"Your children will love it, and most likely you will, too","This movie features a real children favorite: Elmo, from Sesame Street.In this movie, Elmo will learn, though his adventures in Grouchland (where Oscar comes from, for the Sesame Strees ""experts""!), that it's very important to be able to share, and how this will enrich you as a person and better your relationships. A useful lesson for many, and not only for children!The movie contains many songs, performed by various characters; all of them will be fun to learn, and many of them are also very motivational and with nice words.All children will love this movie, and as a parent, you will be happy that for once, they are learning something while watching TV."
3,"Good, but not the best","My twenty month old daughter really enjoys watching the Elmo's World dvds, but this one didn't quite hold her attention as well. As a parent, I also prefer some of the other Elmo videos. I didn't really like the blowing raspberries part, and I also didn't like how they used the word stupid in a preschool movie. I may be uptight, but those are things that I want to try avoid exposing my daughter to when she is just starting to talk. It was cute, though, and the music was catchy. The style of shooting is also very different if you are used to watching other Sesame Street videos, obviously because it is an acutal movie. Maybe it's one of those things that has to grow on you. We'll see. I'm sure I will be watching it over and over before long."
4,Edith!!!!!,"this is a cd for people who really adore Piaf, one of her most popular songs of course is the ""three Bells' however, even the not so famous ones are a pleasure to listen to!"
3,gpod but not great,"this was a good movie but wasn't as good as I had hoped, it just didn't have that little extra something that would have made it great"
1,The Killing of another Classic,"I don't know what's worse : being forced to watch this movie without the possibility of fast forwarding (I saw it in theater), or being forced to watch it, while thinking of the original one... The people who made this should've been denied any access to Sam Peckinpah's work, to begin with.How they managed to give birth to this insipid, pathetic, brainless insult to Sam's masterpiece, is a mystery greater than life itself!"
2,I Don't Brake for Remakes,"Add ""Straw Dogs"" to the list of films remade by Hollywood in an effort to -- well, make more money off a known commodity.This film represents an earnest effort, I guess, and one can appreciate the idea of moving the class warfare from England to America's Bayou Country.Unfortunately, James Marsden is no Dustin Hoffman, and director Rod Lurie is no Sam Peckinpah. The only person who brings anything noteworthy to this new effort is the explosive and ever watchable James Woods, playing an angry and alcoholic Southern football coach whose daughter winds up being the victim of a developmentally challenged young man.""Straw Dogs"" is a powerful drama, to be sure, an inflammatory mix of violence, sex, and conflict between a community and its ""others,"" but it was made in 1971 by Sam Peckinpah, and that is the version you should see. Accept no substitutes!"
1,straw dogs (new remake),"actually does not rate even rating this film, the first one made was actually 100,000 % better than this remake the acting was horrable"
1,this one is a real dog!,if you like predjust rednecks then this one is a winner. the acting was very awful and the scenes unbearable 90+ minutes of sure rottentomatoes. dont waste your money on this dog of a movie
2,Don't wast your time,"This movie was so boring that I was ready to ask for a refund. Not at all what I thought it was going to be. It actually took the last 30 minutes of the movie to get exciting, a litte to late if you ask me. If there is literally nothing else to watch on tv or to rent, not quite sure you would even want to watch this movie. Too bad you can't get refund from movies that are horrible."
3,hummmm ...,"great action in this movie. I loose it with the mental guy who they never say if he's a straw dog (they take care of their own) and if the main character, the x-cheerleader/actress, did just the one guy or the whole team. Why would she tease these men and think that they wouldn't feel invited to do her ... little confusing."
2,A bit on the convoluted side,"For me this version didn't compare favorably to the original. Beware: Spoiler ahead... What really bothered me about this movie was Kate Bosworth's character's behavior. First off, exposing herself to the rednecks didn't make much sense. Her not telling her husband about the rapes. And immediately after being raped insisting on going to the ballgame..because ""that's what they do in this town""??? Absolutely made no sense to me. She would have been completely traumatized and would have insisted on getting the hell out of there as soon as possible....AFTER reporting their crimes to authorities. Just didn't ring true for me.Then there was that side story of the retarded man. It was unnecessary, thus for me, made the entire build up in the tension unplausible. The problems leading to the climax didn't even involve the main characters. And did I miss it or what happened to the retarded man?Oh well, those are my two cents for what they are worth."
1,Pathetic - Every Left Wing Stereotype of the South You Can Imagine,"I guess if you're from the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Brookline, MA or Berkley, CA, you may like this movie because it will confirm every negative stereotype you've ever had about Southerners. Guns and hunting? Bad. Southerners? Stupid, lazy, hillbilly, redneck racists who drink excessively, attack women and children, kill black sheriffs, and even have the audacity to be skeptical of global warming! Yes, there's a global warming line!The person who wrote the screenplay for this film, and those persons who were responsible for making it have all the subtlety and intelligence of slugs.If you watch this film and ask for your 90 minutes back, don't blame the folks who gave it a 1-star review here."
3,"Suspenseful, hack n slash with a story...","When this movie decides to wind up, it goes nuts. The first 3/4 of the movie is your general big city X country hicks, you get the drift, kinda winds around, then bam at the end. Deffinately worth the rent if you like this kind of movie."
2,Ugh,"If you want to watch Straw Dogs, watch the original. There's no build up of tension in this cheap remake."
3,"It won't win an Oscar, but it was okay.",It was a decent movie; suspenseful with a few unexpected twists. I love Kate Bosworth and she looked extremely hot in this movie. If I could have given it 2.5 stars I feel that would be a more accurate rating.
3,Decent,This movie is decent. Never seen the original. After seeing the trailer i wanted to see it but i waited until it was on demand. Its kind of dull until the last 15 minutes of the movie. Also pretty weird how they showed a rape scene.And why have dominic purcell(guy from prison break) play as a mental pedophile in this movie? Hes so much better than that.
2,Stray Dogs,"Sorry, but this isn't a patch on the original. I had at least some hopes for this but very little paid off. I suppose if your idea of red neck culture is to combine football, religion, sex, and hunting, this may be your film, but it just doesn't have anything new to say and the impact of the sex and violence in the original far exceeds anything in this. There's a reason this didn't do all that much box office."
2,A Turgid Remake,"This is one of those movies where you keep thinking, ""C'mon, c'mon, c'mon"" Long, slow, boring build-up to an unsatisfactory jump-cut violent revenge conclusion. The original Straw Dogs was sensational for its time, but now it's dated.The acting here is phoned in. There is absolutely no chemistry between Marsden and Bosworth. Alexander Sarsgard tries his best to carry the movie, but he can't manage it all on his own. And it's sad to see the great James Woods chewing up the scenery as a drunken, crazed, over-the-hill high-school football coach.The whole point of Straw Dogs is supposed to be the gory climax, but even here, the film falls short. If you want to see a really compelling revenge movie, rent ""I Spit on Your Grave"" instead."
2,Hated it,The story line started off interesting but later turned into a story about lies and secrets. There was no real grounds for the start of the movie just the assumption that Kate Bosworth returned home with her new husband. It was obvious that she left for some reason in the first place. She appeared to tempt the men sexually. Later two the men returned to rape her which was an unexpected event to the audience. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
1,Horrible Movie,"I went to see this movie on opening night, I was expecting a really good horror movie, but that's not what I got! First of all, the movie is incredibly slow and it just kept getting dragged out. The previews for this movie made it look intense and action filled, but in reality most of that action occurs in the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. Second of all, I didn't really find any of the characters to be likable....not even the main characters they seemed idiotic and somewhat pompous. The ending was also terrible! Everyone in the theater with me was incredibly disappointed with the film; I never heard one positive thing about the movie from anyone in the audience.WARNING: to those that dislike rape scenes, then you probably won't want to see this movie."
1,boring as fok,this movie is boring as fok. the action took the entire movie to arrive. total dissapointement i did not like it at all.
1,Don't waste your precious time,I am sorry Kate Bosworth has to be a part of this film - what a train wreck. Save your time for another film
2,Typical weak remake,"Very weak remake of a classic motion picture; lacks any of the emotional tension of the original. Could not connect with any of the characters, the sympathy felt for the original characters was totally lacking for this film. Save your money and watch the original."
2,Absurdly violent,"I guess this 2011 film has an antecedent in the old days and is some sort of update, but even so, why is this form of ultra violence considered entertainment for modern day human beings? What is the redeeming social value here? This is kind of a mishmash of the usual hillbilly redneck violence crossed with unsuspecting snobs from the big city. The results are sadistic and almost unwatchable at times. The grand finale is the expected blood bath you know is coming almost from the first frame. Kate Bosworth alone makes it unclear where she is going, seeming at times to despise her educated Hollywood hubby and still crave the attention of her Neanderthalic high school quarterback boyfriend. Only for the non-squeamish."
3,Entertaining,"It is nothing special. Not sure if I am reviewing the movie or the quality of delivery. Quality of delivery was great. Movie was just entertaining, nothing more."
3,Old vs New,"I think the original version with Dustin Hoffman sets ""the mood"" more convincingly. This is a story that lives or dies on its last few scenes - if the build up is not there the whole reason for the movie is lost.In particular, even though Kate Bosworth is drop-dead beautiful, I think Susan George (also a looker) did a better job playing Amy. I think the viewer isn't sure abut Susan George's Amy until the very end, and maybe evenafter the action ends - I didn't get that ambiguous feeling from Kate B. Also, I think Dustin Hoffman play David perfectly - he held to his convictions and answered the question we had all along about his courage.If you'e seen either version and liked it, I think you should absolutely see he other."
4,I enjoyed it,I enjoyed it more than I thought I would Not as good as the original in my opinion but enjoyable all the same.
4,I am suprised with the bad reviews,I loved this movie but maybe I am just partial to Alex. I do think the movie showed many truth's even if in Hollywood fashion but that's what makes it entertaing.
5,The Memoirs of Sara Harvey,"Shauna has written a beautiful and intriguing period novel about a time in American history where minorities were treated despicably. Yet, Shauna's characters are given a dignity and grace, even while facing death, that many of us can only hope to have if faced with similar circumstances. When you add the plot twists and turns and the surprise ending all wrapped in a mystery that flows through the narrative, you will be the recipient of a literary treat that you won't be able put down until the last page is read. Thank you Shauna--Looking forward to more of your work."
5,Great watch!,"I received my watch a few days ago, and after wearing it almost non-stop since its arrival, I have to say that I love it! I had to get the strap adjusted, as it was way too big upon arrival (and I'm not a small girl). It's not a ""dainty"" watch, but it's not overpowering, either. The face is easy to read, and the date window is magnified so you can read that easily, too. I was concerned about the clasp at first, since it doesn't feel very substantial, but so far the clasp has not come undone accidentally so I've had no problems. I've even worn it in the shower and yes, it really is water resistant! Although it is a little bigger than I expected, overall I think this is a wonderful everyday watch."
4,Great Watch!,"I have had this watch for 4 years. I love it and I am even wearing it as I type this. However, one thing that I wish was a little different was the fact that the glass that magnifies the date gets scratched very easily. Right now, it is difficult for me to clearly see the date. Although this is a flaw that i have come to overlook, it is still a great piece and I really enjoy wearing it."
5,Great Book for the Morbidly Curious,This is a very interesting book for those of us interested in how celebrities died.The author covers many well-known celebrities as well as many little known Hollywood personalities.I enjoyed this book very much! It is well worth the money!
4,Shannon,The book is very good.But I read only Shannon's pages..Page 289.Never confuse Shannon with Savannah but love both.
3,Cheaply made,"We have some older mugs like these and there much better Quility. I guess it's like everything else nowadays, made in china"
1,disappointed,"It arrived with one granite side cracked all the way across. The frame was not flush, so it couldn't be put together properly and the hardware rusted after one breif rain."
2,charger for the cellphone,I recieved the charger and it was in good condition as the seller said it was. Unfortunately I was unable to use it because I found my charger but it did work great for the time I did use it for.
4,"Motorola travel chargers do the trick, but are less versatile","I recently had to purchase these for a business user, and was disappointed to have to do so. Motorola phones used to come with chargers that worked on variable (US and Int'l) voltages, but now their chargers that come with US phones work on 110v only. This means a Telecom Manager of company like mine now has to purchase additional chargers for travelers. Most of the phones that are compatible with this charger are quad-band and can work in countries across the globe...why ship it with a charger that only works in one place, especially when they used to ship phones like this with chargers that worked on variable voltages? My guess is accessory sales were lagging, and this was a convenient way to boost sales. The charger itself works well, but I'm simply annoyed at the prospect of having to purchase it, when in the recent past, I did not have to."
1,Poorly Made,I purchased this charger 6 weeks ago and it broke when I pulled it out of the wall. The entire back came off leaving the actually plug part in the wall. I bought it to replace my lost charger. Warning do not waste your money.
4,Works fine at fair price,This lightweight charger works great. I actually bought it as a replacement but it works great to travel with as well. There is even a red light when on so you ensure it has a connection. Works for me!
1,Received promptly but defective ! Waiting on replacement !!,"I just ordered this as I needed urgently for my spouse who lost her charger on recent vacation. The charger looks brand new, but doesn't work ! plugged in and no output at all. I would have hoped somebody would have atleast just plugged in to do a simple test to see if the power light is blinking or not before mailing it. What a waste !!! Now waiting on replacement and hope this time they get it right !"
2,Poor Quality Home Movie,"As a cruising family, we can relate to the events(positive) and as the techno side of sailing is scant (negative).The viewing offer should be at no charge and we would like a refund."
3,"Bit of real sailing, a bit of chicanery",This is a worthwhile watch as long as one understands that it is a compilation of old videotape and lots of new digital camera shots. At least two sailing vessels were used in the film while the narrator spoke in old 16mm film.
5,Semper Fi,"Love reading Johnnie Clarks books, he is all Marine and writes great books about Marines and this book is a story of the life ofa young man before and during his life in the Marine Corps, World War Two thru Vietnam, good times and bad and loss of innocence.Great read."
3,Horsetail,I saw a lot of reviews containing horsetail for hair growth i just ordered me a bottle so i will have to give it some time to work as people have said it takes time to see results. As i already have APL hair before taking this product. I will come back with a review on this product in about a month.
3,I am not sure.....yet,The texture of my hair appears a little different. I trim the ends of my ponytail more often than before. Faster growth? I am not sure. I will start my second bottle this week. I plan to give it six months before I give an honest opinion.
4,dusty,"This little bag works great . A vacuum is best , but this is second best . So much better than just letting the dust fill the room. As long as you empty it often , it works.When done it rolls up nice and small .This stays with me all the time ,it also fits other brands of table saws so its a no brainer."
5,great table saw dust bad,I am very happy with this bag. It is big enough so I don't have to empty it every 2 minutes.
3,it catches SOME sawdust,"It's better than nothing, but I'm definitely going to save up for a shop-vac to hook up to my table saw in the future."
4,Works for me!,This bag works for what I needed it for. I only use this saw occasionally and didn't want the sawdust shooting out the back and this bag worked for that. It isn't a very big bag so if you do much sawing it will require emptying more often. Over all it works well.
2,not very effective as a dust collector,"I picked up this bag when I purchased the Bosch 4000 table saw. I was hoping to avoid using a vaccuum attachment on the job site. I quickly found that if I was serious about containing saw dust, I had to ditch this collection bag. It collected maybe half the dust, if that. If you have the power to run both the saw and a vaccuum attachment, do it, and leave the bag for when you can work outside or you can unplug the saw and vaccuum up the mess."
1,Why did I bother?,"Don't do it! I bought the bag to go with my worksite Bosch Table Saw (the saw is awesome). There is dust everywhere, including a bit in the bag. But if it's going to be everywhere anyway, I still need to vacuum, so now I need to do that AND empty the bag too.I would have saved the 15 bucks and upped the shop vac to the next level instead."
2,looks are decieveing!!,"the picture looks good but the performance is disapointing !! it does catch some saw dust but the rest ends up on floor and in your face!! with the bag on ,the back pressure from the bag over the exhaust forces the dust around the blade guard and up !! through the table plate and into your face !!! wear eye protection ! better off investing the money in a vacuum system or a hose connector for my Jet-dust system ? (jim casey- carpentry,mashpee ma.)"
2,"Catches some, not all","This dust collector bag does catch a majority of the sawdust during cuts, however, sawdust still flies out the bottom, top and around the blade, so doing cuts in a closed basement or closed garage is still going to require clean-up."
1,Don't bother,"As mentioned in another review here, your best bet for collecting sawdust from your table saw is with a Shop Vac or other shop vacuum. This bag, instead of collecting dust, impedes the flow of waste material and makes more of a mess in the shop than running the saw without the bag. It will collect some material, but far more material is blown up from the saw and into the work space when the bag is attached."
1,Not worth the money,"Most of the dust blows out around the saw blade, but there is a little bit left over that collects in the bag. I'd say about 20% of the dust is actually collected. Save your money and use a shop vac or a real dust collector."
4,ok for the money,"For the cost of this bag, you're not going to get a dustless system. It certainly doesn't collect all sawdust, but it catches a good part of it. I found after a few dozen cuts the bag filled up, but there was plenty more dust under and all around the saw base. But what the bag caught was that much less for me to vacuum, so I'm happy with that.The problem lies more with the Bosch tablesaw, which doesn't direct all the dust down the chute - for that to happen, the saw would need a major redesign. The current design simply has a channel under the blade leading to the chute in back, but it's open, so the spinning blade kicks dust in every direction, not just down the channel and chute.I found that the blade I was using made some difference too - a 40-tooth blade sent more dust down the chute and into the bag than an 80-tooth blade. The latter probably makes finer dust, more prone to being scattered."
1,Not working for me.,I purchased this bag in hopes that end of day clean-up would be made simpler. Despite cutting only kiln-dried interior trim stock the sawdust began backing up in the saw's discharge chute long before the bag was even half full. I guess only a dust collection system will help me.
2,"Was hoping for much better performance, but no...","Please pay attention to the one to three star ratings. This dust collection bag only captures 50% or less of the dust coming off the Bosch table saw. It's not really worth the money. The table saw just doesn't build up enough air pressure to force much of the dust into the bag.A much better, although more expensive, solution is a shop vacuum connected toThe Dust Deputy($89.99) and aniVac Automated Vacuum Switch($48.95) (both sold on Amazon).The Dust Deputycaptures about 99% of the stuff that normally goes into the vacuum which saves on filters or frequent messy emptying, and theiVac Automated Vacuum Switchlets you simply turn on the saw so that the vacuum turns on and off automatically. Great combination and a much cleaner work shop."
2,Bosch TS1004 Table Saw Dust Collector Bag,Does not work. Most power tool dust bags do not work that well. Best case is that they may capture 70% of the saw dust. This was not even close. I had a pile of saw dust all over the floor and saw and almost none in the bag. You would be better off just putting a sock or stocking on the exhaust.
1,Forget it.,If this bag works as well as the miter saw bag then you would be much better off buying a box of dust masks and a pair of coveralls. Waste of money.
1,minimize the saw dust in the shop...,"simple to install and pretty effective. The only draw back is that slivers of scap wood can easily block the ""sawdust tunnel"" that feeds the dust into the catcher. Empties easily."
2,works well for what it is,"For what is is, it works well. Bag will clog if cutting wet material. bag lays on ground, so if ground is wet, it's a mess. There is no suction, so sawdust still comes up from blade, therefore material will get sawdust on it, therefore sawdust will get on the ground. I don't know where to store this thing, so now when I need it, I'm looking all over the place for it.2 1/2"" shop vac hose slides right onto saw. It is the better choice. I use a foot switch christmas tree extension cord so I can turn vacum on and off with ease."
2,Just a Bag,"Thought I would give this bag a try as I was purchasing a few other items on Amazon and take advantage of the free shipping offer. The Bosch table saw that the bag attaches to is great, the bag is not! When ripping a 2 X 4 the chips just plug up in the bottom of the saw as there is not enough flow into the bag. The bag also plugged up at the next job when I was just doing general cross cut work in poplar and oak. Probably need to purchase one of those canister type dust collectors. Save your money and dont buy this Bosch accessory."
2,Not even worth the $10,"i thought i would use this for the small quick cuts but once you attach the bag, the saw blows the chips into the bag (ok so far) BUT the pressure that builds up because the air doesnt escape out of the bag as fast as it is blown in causes the chips to blow back up through the saw blade opening right into your face (and all around you too). i measured the dust i had to clean up vs the dust collected and it did seem to get about 50% of the sawdust (very rough/unscientific measurement) but at that point i had to go through the exact same amount of effort to clean up the dust that blew out of the machine.not worth it"
3,bosch table saw dust bag,"although very light and handy,this cheap solution is really only good for small projects.unless you don't mind emptying the bag constantly.another way around this though,is to open the bottom of the bag and put it over a five gallon bucket,which you can then swap out as you go."
2,Not worth the price,"Not worth the price you ask? It's only $11.00. True. Don't waste your $11.00. Instead plug a shop vac into the exhaust port of the table saw. The small exhaust port gets jammed easily and if that happens, forget collecting any dust in the bag. If the exhaust port stays clear, then I'd say I collect about 10% of the dust produced. Especially with MDF. What a mess!! I built a moble stand for the saw and folding stand so I push the whole thing out into the drive way and use it out there because of the mess it makes inside the garage.The saw is great and I'm very happy with it. I gave it 4 or 5 five stars in my review of the saw itself. But this collection bag is pointless. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.Until I get my dust collector for all my tools, I use this bag on my DeWalt 2-speed planer where it works great. I empty it frequently, but that's a planer for you."
4,The Dust Collector Does Work--More or Less,"This well-made dust collector for the Bosch Table Saw appears to be made of nylon and cotton and attaches to the dust port at the rear of the saw. It has a zippered bottom, and does collect sawdust. It is not as good as connecting to a shop vac but even with a shop vac you will still have sawdust to pick up--with any make of ""job-site"" saw. I frequently use my saw in a garage so I use the dust collector and I also place a cardboard box under the saw. A great deal of the sawdust goes into the box, quite a bit goes into the Bosch dust collector, and a goodly amount will still be all over the floor. This is the way with all saws of this type. The price was great $10.99, and I ordered it with a saw thus avoiding any shipping fees or sales tax. I do recommend this accessory as it is a help. I ordered it on January 30, with a delivery date on or before February 14. I received it before February 10. It was well-packed. I am more than happy with Amazon and Bosch."
2,Get Three,"The 4000K must rank way up there with the world's greatest sawdust dispersing tools. My Dust Collector was tried and failed. It is now gathering dust (pun intended). It is a nice thing to look at and seems to fit OK, but you wouldn't want to depend on it. I can't be certain with actual efficiency rating, but I'd be shocked if you could prove it captured even half the sawdust. Get a REAL dust extractor with enough vacuum to suck the paint off the tablesaw stand, and you will be sure to collect 90% of the saw's by-product. The other 10% will be up your nose unless you wear a paper mask. :-) But real men eat sawdust, don't they?"
1,Waste of money!!!,"This thing is 100% useless! It hardly collects any dust at all, and what's worse is that it causes the dust tube on the saw to clog up, thereby causing the blade ""well"" to clog up and spit dust back in my face. Not cool! I threw it in the trash."
3,Bosch Table Saw Dust Collector Bag,"The bag was easy to install, but only collects about 50% of the dust collected. A shop vac might do better, but not too much better."
3,dustless for less,seems to be working okay but for $15 expectations were not high. only have used it once and failed to clean under the saw first. so hard to evaluate how much sawdust dropped under the saw.
3,Get a Vacuum,"This device does work, but it clogs up really easily-thus creating tons of blow back from the kerf plate. I used it a few times then retired it. Vacuum or dust pile is the way I roll."
4,The album that made Teddy a solo superstar!,"This was Teddy's second album and ""Close The Door"" virtually guaranteed he would continue to be the #1 male R&B singer of the 1970s. His self-titled solo debut had set the prototype for his subsequent PIR releases but this one became his most successful project thanks to ""Only You"", ""Get Up, Get Down, Get Funky, Get Loose"" and the above-mentioned classic ballad."
2,go for the main series,"I have been a long time fan of James Herriot's ""All Creatures Great and Small"" series of books, so was excited when my dad got me ""It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"" and ""Vet in a Harness"" for Christmas this year. Turns out they are just book containing excerpts of the larger books. The stories are still good of course, but I much prefer the original books because they have a more coherent story line and contain the same stories. I was very disappointed that these didn't contain new material."
1,It shouldnt happen to a vet,"BEWARE, I purchased this series thinking they were a continuation of James Heriot's first four but to my disapointment the publisher riped off the public by reprinted the original stories under a new title. I tryed to return them but gave up and donated them to the local library"
4,"light, fun read","It's not an amazingly well written story. It's a bunch of fun, feel-good anecdotes that are woven together to give you an idea of the author's daily life as a young vet. A good thing to write on the inside cover: a pound was equivalent to 20 shillings or 240 pence and a British pound in 1930 was worth about $270 American dollars today."
4,A little scary,"This book kept you guessing. I got a little spooked by the trolls and various events that took place, but I liked it lots."
3,gospel hip hop funked up with the p baby,"before kirk franklin took off and sampled funhkadelic's one nation this crew predated him by not only being down with p funk but by getting bootsy collins, catfish collins, bernie worrell, and the horny horns on here. really gospel could'nt get more funkier I'm bnot that much into gospel but this is for all the p funk fans who want to check out everything the funk mob has done in their sparetime."
1,Terrible way to treat God's Word,"After showing the Gospel of John to my high school age Bible class, I was excited to continue with the Acts of the Apostles. The Gospel of John was well directed, well photographed and presented God's Word with the honor and glory it deserves. The Acts of the Apostles was filmed very cheaply, the direction and the ""special effects"" were terrible, the acting was rotten. Too much added to the actual text. Using Luke to narrate the passages that the director did not want to shoot takes away from the power of the scriptures.The kids in my class spent more time giggling and laughing at what was shown on screen than learning God's Word. Hard to blame them though when the crowds presented act like they are in a Monte Python movie. The movie was intended to be an enrichment for our high school aged Bible study class. It was disappointing!"
1,Poorly directed presentation,"Very poorly directed. Although script is word for word from Acts (NIV), director often added laughter to portrayal of events - examples, at Pentacost & during Paul's statement concerning Jesus' appearance to him on the road to Damascus and the events following his conversion. The director obviously does not believe the text to be credible."
3,Not captioned or subtitled,It is a wonderful video that gives you the visual portrayal of the book of Acts. I purchased this for my church who ministers to Deaf people and rely on captioning. The specifications stated that this video was captioned and subtitled to find that it wasn't - which was a big disappointment. It would have been such a great tool for our bible study.
4,Visual Bible-Acts,"This is a good resource for teaching the Bible especially to kids that are visual learners. They retain much more with this video and it is the NIV scripture, nothing added, nothing taken away."
2,Unfortunately - extremely disappointed.,"I purchased this DVD to show to my Sunday School class after we had finished studying the book of Acts. Total flop. I looked around the room and not one of my students was engaged at all. I was so disappointed.I have no problem with the dialogue being verbatim with the NIV version of the Bible. In fact, I would prefer it that way. However, portions that were ripe for dramatization - e.g. the account of Ananias and Sapphira - were mundane, as they were dramatized only by Luke telling the story to others that were on a ship with him.I am sorry to say if you are looking to use this as an opportunity to see Scripture come to life after studying it - especially for teens - you should probably look elsewhere."
1,Awful,The acting is awful and will put one to sleep. The actors and director should be ashamed to be associated with this release. The movie was intended to be an enrichment for our Bible study class. Disappointing!
2,Sadly - I too was disappointed,"The acting truly WAS(as someone else called it) 'wooden'. I have read books about Paul and Luke, and have to believe that their characters were much more colorful, in reality, which this film captures barely in shades of gray. I purchase these types of films, for the purpose of showing them to those with little exposure to these stories. This film was for me, laborious to watch. I even broke out laughing out loud in a few places. Sorry .... I cannot give this a higher rating. It does not due Acts justice. I hope that Visual Bible's 'Matthew' is of higher quality."
5,Great Stuff!,"The Visual Bible (both Acts and Matthew) is wonderful. It brings the Scriptures to life in a way that is compelling and believable. The actors are first-rate. For me, watching these has brought another dimension of meaning to the NIV text. It's a great option if you want to study but would rather not read."
5,Read the bible,I love these visual bibles. They are awesome1 You can actually follow along with your bible and see that there is little to no deviation fromt he word of God. This dvd and others like it helped me read and understand some difficult passages.
4,Well done video,This is a well done video - that I got just out of curiosity. The costumes seem to reflect the times and the actors seemed to fit the roles. I will watch iagain in a few weeks while following the actual text.
1,mr sam,the whole movie was good and word for word with the bible.the issue that i have is the acting played by james brolin did not show peter as commanding.also it seemed to me that there were not enough back ground actors.it was kind of dull.
3,"Good Table saw, Bad for Molding and Dado blades","I have used this saw for about 3 months now for general projects just needing the use of a fair table saw. With the exception of a poor fence, this saw does a good job. The motor has fair power for larger pieces of wood. 1/2"" - 3/4"" plywood is not a problem.Just recently I attempted to use a Molding Blade that was supposed to fit a ""Standard"" 10"" Table Saw. Well I quickly found that the 5/8"" Arbor is too short to fit a Molding blade, and will only fit a Dado Blade up to 1/2"". I found a way to mount the blade (used a smaller washer instead of the thick spacer)and it had plenty of power to handle the task.Overall this is not a bad saw for around [price]. The fence is quite ""rickety"" and is not a precision piece of equipment by any means."
3,Good Hooks,"An excellent sophomore record for the Canadians. The songs are crisp and well-produced. I find the songs stuck in my head hours after listening. I purchased a copy of this disk for a friend as well. One of the better sounds to come out of Canada in a while. Listen to ""Abbey"" and ""Aptitude."""
4,GOOD ANTHOLOGY OF BETTER DAYS & EARLY SOLO WORKS,this anthology is a good cross section of the best recordings that paul butterfield made with his upstate new york band Better days. This anthology includes selections from the two Better Days records ( Better Days & It All Comes Back )and also selecions from the out of print solo Paul Butterfield recordings Put It In Your Ear & North & South.
5,I'm goin' back to the Country Church with Joshua!,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about Joshua Nelson? Truly, he is the Prince of Gospel and I declare that he is the future of Gospel. If you are worn and weary of this ""secular"" Gospel(???), that has a form of godliness but no power, if you are tired of trying to piece together enough JESUS in this new school music to call it Gospel, if you want the real deal, this is the album you have to get, period. A word of caution: Do not take this CD to work with you to listen to it-you may get up and run and shout all over your workplace!!!"
4,Stay with it,"I must confess I almost couldn't get through ""Drinking the Rain"". Kates Shulman's account of a citified feminist's return to nature seemed an unintential parody, not helped by the comically overstated title. But midway through Ms. Shulman's story I became hooked. What seemed at first a pretentious and self-important rant transformed into a thoughtful and evocotive musing on what it is to be an artist. Ironically, it's only after Shulman returned to the city (and later goes to teach in Colorado) that the book came alive for me. Her descriptions of dinner with an old feminist friend left me teary eyed at their simple eloquence, and the descriptions of a snowy Colorado reunion with her kids kept me reading. By the end, I adored this story."
3,Amazing and Rather Confusing Woman,"I felt amazement, admiration for someone who could truly relish a solitary life and virtually give up comforts and family even if for just part of the year. She really didn't explain her motivations and the reader has to assume that her unhappy marriage was the impetus. But what was the gain in living alone in a secluded ME cabin, eating all sorts of wild greens and mussels? She hever explained the value of the experience, only the experience itself."
5,"inspirational, thought- provoking, concise","I found this book thought-provoking and moving. One beautiful afternoon, while reading it on my porch, I literally could not put it down. It could be a life changing book. I will be recommending this to my book club."
5,Inspirational and educational,"As a 50ish woman who has dabbled with the self-sufficient life (organic farm with goats and all the rest of the critters in my mid 30's) I found this book extremely readable and thoughtworthy. Though I still expouse less consumerism here in an urban setting and as an environmentalist, I sometimes lose sight of my goals as the author does in Manhatten. I also liked her approach or what she learned from her friend Margaret - what she learned at the nubble, she could apply in all aspects of her life. And in all places, whether it is the city or the back country. On my book club list of must reads."
2,Save your time,"This book drones on and on about eating plants and clams from nature. The author seems to think that because she was a feminist activist she made some significant world contribution. She must repeat her feminist affiliation a dozen times. By the time you get 40-50 pages into the book you start praying it will get better. Huge paragraphs of lists of wild plants that she eats on an island off the coast of Maine. About as exciting to read as an ancestral tree. 100 pages later no improvement. People get directed to this book searching for meaning in midlife, age group 40-55. Save your time. This is a snore. Time better used: ""The Art of Effortless Living"" by Ingrid Bacci."
2,Enough already!,"Drinking the Rain did not leave me thirsting for more. Alix Shulman's subtle male-bashing and her forlorn nostalgia for the ""failed"" women's movement tarnished this book. Her quest for solitude did not leave her with an epiphany or any great enlightenment. She remained, at book's end, not very much different from the middle-aged woman who journeys to a remote island in Maine to lead a rustic, uncomplicated life. For this she is to admired; no running water, no electricity, a cantankerous gas-fueled refrigerator and a autodidactic living off the land (and sea). She never reaches Gurdieff's ""long thought"". Shulman hides from the reader, offering somewhat brittle comments in lieu of insight. Her record as an ""activist"" has given that word a new definition, ""someone who feels passionately about a subject, talks it to death and ultimately does nothing about it."" Shulman seems incapable of taking the truly courageous next step, which is to tell us what she's learned."
4,Buffy Xposed a real good fireside book,"This book is good. It is an unofficial guide to the world of Buffy but it has some really cool stuff like extensive reviews of the first two seasons' episodes, a by no means extensive internet guide to must see Buffy sites and entertaining looks at the influence of ""Dark Shadows"" on the show and also a history of vampires on television and movies. A must read!! Black and white pictures add to its gothic, unauthorized feel. I really liked it"
2,This book is sort of disappointing,"There are not that many pictures and it doesnt really tell me anything I couldn't have found out on the internet. It is 256 pages, but it's BIG print and a lot of it is Episode guide stuff. I was unhappy with it."
3,"This book is an okay book,but i've seen more imformation.","This book is ok, and i would reccomend this book if u wanted some information about sarah when she was younger. It also has the shows from the first and second season."
5,ALBUM OF THE YEAR! BEST NEW ARTIST!,"Wish I could do my own Grammy Awards... this band would clean up this year. I don't usually like new bands, but these guys blew me away. This band is kinda like Fuel (the original band, not the crappy pop Fuel they put on the radio) meets AFI but goes far beyond the scope of both. The songs get in your head and don't leave... I'm rockin out in the grocery store and singing along to the playback in my head and everybody's throwing grapes at me and giving me dirty looks. This should become a part of your collection TODAY!"
2,Blah,"Bought this album based on the strong showing on Rock Against Bush II. Too bad I cannot return it and get something else.The music is good enough, but the vocals are weak and completely masked by bad mixing. Sad, I like to hear what they are saying...Doubtful this will get much more play, after the 3 listens it has already gotten. If you want something really good, go get GC5 or the Hudson Falcons...Scott"
1,Kett and Porter Cable Shears (same difference),"I own a set of the Kett and the Porter Cable siding shears.They appear to be exactly the same.In fact I've replaced the blades in the Porter Cable with the Kett replacement set. You get the center and both side blades for less than you pay for just the PC center blade.They both have the same problem. The bolts that hold the blades in are constantly breaking,and can be a pain to replace."
3,the kett 193,I DO EXTERIOR TRIM I ONLY DID 6 HOUSES APROX- 2500 PCS OF HARDIPLANK CUT AND MY SET IS ALL READY SITTING IN THE SHOP BROKE
5,Entertaining Read - Well Worth It,"Leigh Brackett wrote this interesting sci fi thriller after moving to Ohio, and in Ohio it begins, two generations after the Destruction, a global annhilation by nuclear holocaust. Fear predominates the culture and identity of every individual and it is the fight against the fear of knowledge, that most dreaded, that Len Coulter wages along with his cousin, Esau. A believable piece of fiction for a book written over 60 years ago which is thoroughly relevant to the present-day culture of fear."
4,Hope in Hell,"The music is a dense tangle of acoustic murmurs and distorted whispers. The backwards drumming of 'Roseblood', the womb-throb of 'Umbilical' and the repetitive simplicity of 'Take Everything' all combine to create a sense of woozy distortion. A fog only occasionally punctuated by the mournful sighs of Hope herself.She stands by her man, and it ends in tears ('Cry, Cry, Cry'); she turns on the charm and he ignores her ('Still Cold'); eventually she's forced to conclude 'I've Been Let Down'--again. Nothing it seems will alleviate her distress. Even a song ostensibly about good time ('Happy') is delivered with the resigned drone of a genuine pessimist.Still, that's what we want. If you're going to wallow, might as well do it properly."
3,good but not great,"i came to know this album because was the sweet&dreamy vocal of the singer featuring in ""munki"" & ""surrender"".i liked it v.much the first time i heard of it,espc.the first song listening to the beautiful vocal singing ""close yr eye&look at me....."" that was like a dream. but when i've listened to it after several times all the tracks except the first song sounded quite familiar.i wonder if the later works of ""mazzy star"" still like this one."
5,DON'T PAY MONEY FOR THIS CD!,"NOTE: I gave this CD 5 stars becuase of the music. HOWEVER.....DO NOT BUY THIS CD FROM AMAZON.WHY? Because every song on this CD is available here on Amazon on other CD's that even if bought all together DO NOT equal the $95.00 + dollars you'sd be wasting if you bought this CD.These are all the album versions. Nothing special on here other than the music but as far as different mixes, etc. These are not new.All you have to do is get KooKoo, Rockbird, Def, Dumb, & Blonde, and Debravation."
1,Decepcionante,"I had high hopes when I bought this CD; unfortunately, they weren't realized. I'm not familiar with Miguel Rios, but I like Ana Belen's singing, and I was hoping to hear some good Spanish versions of the Brecht/Weill songs. The adaptations of the texts aren't bad; it's the arrangements I can't abide - they all remind me of Bobby Darin's execrable, jazzy version of ""Mack the Knife."" If you like that sort of thing, then this CD might be for you, but if you want to hear a good interpretation in the original spirit of Brecht and Weill, listen instead to Dagmar Krause's ""Supply and Demand."""
5,"Regarding Science-Ejected Vitalism, 1998:","Vitalism is a profoundly science-ejected concept, though many CAM or 'natural health' cabals falsely claim that vitalism survives scientific scrutiny.I quote:""by the end of the 19th century the concept of the prevailing 'specific vital force' ('vitalism'), thought to be essential for living organisms, lost its popularity [p.262...] it was Wohler, and later Kolbe in 1845 who synthesized acetic acid, who helped banish 'vital force,' or 'vitalism,' from organic chemistry and from science altogether [p.265].""-r.c."
5,Splendid double!,"Vladimir Ashkenazy has impressed me a lot with these recordings along with Scriabin's Sonatas. I think the highlights on this Chopin's collection are Sonatas 1,2,3 and the Fantasie in F minor more than 24 Etudes which are played greatly especially the Revolutionary (possibly one of the best i've ever listened to) though there are other pianist more impressive than Ashkenazy such as Boris Berezovsky, Juana Zayas, Nikolai Lugansky, Andrei Gavrilov and the young Jean Frederic Neuburger just to name a few. But the 3 Sonatas and the Fantasie are performend marvellously. Also the quality of the sound recording is really high. This is a splendid double!"
5,Great watch,This watch was a great bargain. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absoultely loved it. This watch looks great with outfits that silver watches just don't go with. It looks expensive and i was very impressed with the quality of it. I would recommend this watch to anyone.
4,Last LRB album with lead-singer John Farnham,"Learning from the unsuccessful release of the 'Playing To Win' album, GRAEHAM GOBLE obviously pushed the band back to their soft-rock roots and consequently used more close harmony arrangements and commercially oriented songs. For that reason 'No Reins' became a very good LITTLE RIVER BAND album, which nobody knew at that time [hardcore fans excluded]. The 'New Romantic' wave had taken over to America and left guitar-oriented bands far behind, for more modern sounds using synthesizers and computers were asked by the audience. The missing success is truly deplorable, as No Reins contains some of LRB'S most beautiful recordings, for instance ""Face In The Crowd"", ""Time For Us"", ""When The War Is Over"" [which is a cover version of a COLD CHISEL recording from their 'Circus Animals' album, penned by new LRB drummer STEVEN PRESTWICH - but much more convicting in this LRB version] and ""Forever Blue"" [which became a delayed hit 1995 in the Netherlands]."
4,"Not Just Another ""Face In The Crowd""","""Reminiscing"" about the Little River Band, I found my cassette copy of this CD and remembered listening to it ad nauseam when I bought it. After visiting some historical sites about the LRB, I realized it's place in the group's mythos. There were no Billboard Top 100 hits off this recording but yet it produced two of my personal favorites from the LBR. ""Face In The Crowd"" has always been a song I could play over and over, ""Forever Blue"" is a hauntingly beautiful ballad of missed opportunity. ""Paper Paradise"" and ""Thin Ice"" are solid Little River melodies, and the rest of the songs are all at least worthy of a listen now and then. Yes, it's the Glenn Shorrock vocals that created LBR's biggest commercial hits, but here John Farnham proves he's no slouch either!"
1,harsh sounding album.,"This album was Graham Goble's folly.It is far too harsh sounding and,unfortunately,vocalist John Farnham took some flack for the failure of this album.It was not his fault.The harder rock style just sounds harsh.It was called ""no reins"" when it should have been called ""no brains"".the softer album ""The Net"" was much better."
5,Fit like advertised,I have a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and this fit just fine. The only problem I had was getting the bolts properly torqued b/c they were hard to get to under the jeep.
5,An odd book I'm glad I took a chance on.,"I'd never heard of this book or this author, but I don't know why. I'm a connoisseur of books on lake and sea monsters and this was a singular work. Baumann took it upon himself to do a lot of basic field research and turned up a lot of eye-witness accounts that I haven't found in print anywhere else. [Presumably people who had never been interviewed before.]This is well-worth reading if you're looking for some new insight and stories about the lake monster phenomena. :)"
1,not worth $25,Disappointed...not as good as the first one. This one's more like a family video. Needs improvement.
3,not the best spread book,"while the theory is explained, the required parameters for entering a trade are vague."
3,"Not bad, all things considered","Unless you're a Great White fan (and admittedly, I'm not), don't expect great things from this album. As rock bands, they were pretty mediocre. That said, some of their songs are worth a wry smile."
1,Ungreat White,"Just another 80's hair band that had one hit (Once bitten, twice shy) and then disappeared. The rest of the album is not all enjoyable. I was only able to listen to the album once because the other tracks aren't worth my time to listen to because they don't sound much like ""Once bitten, twice shy."""
4,You will be glad you added these hits to your collection,"Great White had some great hits, and this CD has some of their most memorable. I would have expected a few more tacks on a ""best of"" CD, but the ones they have are excellent. My favorites are Step On You, All Over Now, Save Your Love, Big Goodbye, Rock Me (excellent for cranking up), and Once Bitten Twice Shy. This CD will fit in well with any good rock collection."
5,Great White ROCKS!!!!!,"The best of ""Great White"" is exactly that!!!!! I wish I had bought it long ago. ""Old Rose Motel,"" ""Rock Me,"" and ""Save Your Love"" are the best from this collection. I'd like to know why the didn't include ""The Angel Song"" from ""Twice Shy."" All of their albums are pretty good, and this one is the best of the best!!!"
1,Danger lurks,"This zero clearance insert is flimsy to the point of being dangerous. Particularly true if cutting anything narrow. The insert caves in against the blade, and it's just asking for trouble. Everything else I have ever used by Bosch -- including the table saw -- is amazingly superior to this piece of junk. It surprises me that they would compromise in so critical an area."
2,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this TS1005 Zero Clearance Insert at the same time I bought the Dado Insert. Unlike the Dado Insert, however, this product is poorly contructed of cheap materials. The insert is so flimsy that I cannot get it level with the table not matter how much I adjust the leveling screws. My biggest gripe with the insert is that is does not ""snap"" into place but you must attach it with machine screws. This causes long changeovers and presents the opportunity to lose the mounting screws. If I had know that insert was designed in this manner I would have made my own out of a much sturdier material.Do not waste your money on this product. Find a better alternative at Rockler or a similar source."
2,You get what you pay for,"The price is low, but I can't recommend it. The metal plates for the pawls to glide on fell off (one before it arrived), and the plastic is really flimsy. I bought a nice one from Woodcraft for several times the price, but it was well worth it. If you aren't sure you need a zero clearance insert, you can start with the Bosch, but you are better off applying the money to a good one. Making your own out of plywood is another option. I like the saw, though!"
3,Good Enough I guess,I have not tried to install it yet. but it looks like lighter and made of plastic rather than some composite or metal. I will update later. Thanks!
2,Plastic,"Though it is good that this product is plastic because it allows you to create the sloted hole you need for your table saw or dado, the product does not have a locking clip and will not sit well or stay in your table saw track. It does not have adjustible screws either to fine tune the height within your table saw slot. Over all, I think this was a piece of crap. You may consider just making your own out of spare hard wood or plywood."
3,Bosch Zero Clearance Insert,While the insert is plastic it could have more reinforcement. The retaining screws are required to hold the insert in place while in use.
2,zero tolerance insert,"In my opinion, it is best to make your own zero tolerance plate out of some MDF or similar material. There are You-tube video's explaining just how to do this. I watched this one and made my own.[...]"
2,it almost works,"I was initially excited when I received this insert blank. I followed the included instructions and cut the blade opening. Very simple. The problems with this item is it's made of plastic and isn't solid enough to not flex when screwed down to the insert opening. As you tighten the screws it contorts pushing some areas up and proud of the saw's table top, and other areas down and below the surface. It has adjustments for height so you can set it even with the table's surface, but that only helps in certain areas of the insert. It's jut too flexible. Also, I use theGrr-ripper Deluxe Supreme Systemwhich relies on you pressing down on your work as you guide it past the blade. Because this insert flexes, it foils your attempts at maintaining adequate pressure on your work piece. That's too bad as not having a useable zero insert is one of the biggest drawback of the Bosch table saw."
4,Bosch Insert,This insert works ok but it does flex. If you are at the end of a board and cutting say a rabbet (where you don't cut all the way through the board) and you don't have the table on both sides of the insert to support the board when you press down the insert will deflect down and cause you to cut alittle deeper. Other than that it works ok.
2,Too flimsy...,This was a waste of money. The plastic it's made from is cheap and flimsy. If you put any downward pressure on your material as you push it through the saw the insert deflects and your material gets caught on the lip between the table and the insert. Threw it right in the garbage and made my own from Baltic birch plywood.
1,Shame on Bosch,"This thing is a toy. It has no place on a saw as well designed as the TS 4000.Pros- It is red.Cons-It is about as rigid as a blade of grass.It is molded from material that is about as thin as a blade of grass.It is impossible to make it level with your table because it flexes every time a board touches it.Every time my saw starts, it catches a tiny sliver of the insert edge.Bottom line- The best use for this thing might be as a template to make your own out of ply. Love my 4000. But, this insert is a waste."
1,Don't bother,"As stated in a few other reviews, a waste of money. Plastic is flexible and does not provide support for small pieces. Make you own from 1/4"" plywood."
2,Temporary solution.,"Despite the bad reviews, I bought 2 of these. They are not great. They flex and they won't stay perfectly flat, but they do keep those small slices from falling inside the saw. ~When I get the extra time~ I'll replace these with something more substantial, until then, it gets the job done."
3,Works,"My only issue is the insert isn't thick enough, therefore it flexes and shifts whereby the blade has hit the sides several times and created opening slightly larger than blade width. In Bosch's defense through, and it should be listed in the description on Amazon, it clearly states on there install instructions for ""cross cuts only"". If used this way, then it shouldn't flex. I will use it as a template to make a studier one for all types of cuts. This can be done using a pattern router bit (w/o having to guess on measurements); then transferring the adjustment screws over, voilà it works!"
1,waste of money,"I bought this to cut small pieces of wood precisely. The deflection was a problem. The normal insert has some as well (but less) which complicates the squaring of the blade process. I had the trouble of the normal insert marking my wood with its red paint, so I thought this might be better. It's much flimsier and comes with mounting screws to keep it in place. (It doesn't pop in and out like the factory insert). I have a crap blade I use to cut normal wood and a nice Freud blade for my more delicate work. So the idea of having to add the extra steps to remove the plate (and find a philips head driver) to replace the blade just doesn't make sense."
1,Hopelessly crumbled cookies,"We ordered this product twice from Amazon and both times the cookies were nothing but crumbs when delivered. I immediately went to the website where it said this product was not eligible for return. We order these for our patients, but they don't want to buy crumbled cookies. We won't buy any more from Amazon."
5,omg! fabulous!,"Based on other online reviews, I couldn't wait to taste these cookies. I brought the box inside the moment I saw it on my front porch, grabbed a box from the larger box, and sampled.Holey moley, these shortbread cookies are fabulous! Be warned that there is a tiny down-side, though. Each 23 g cookie contains 4g of saturated fat...that's 20% of the daily value, folks. However, there is no denying that these are wonderful."
2,Crumby Cookies,"These cookies taste good, BUT they didn't arrive intact. I may have had two out of the 9 cookies in full shape. The rest were pieces; mainly crumbs. I have 6 boxes of crumbs ( because I used the subscibe and save) and will probably use for pie crusts or cheesecake crust.Its disappointing so far as just wanting a couple yummy cookies once in awhile ! Didn't want to have to bake to use. : ("
1,Tasty Cracked Mollusc,"I like gluten free baking and am aware of some pitfalls.....drum roll please....THE XANTHUM GUM. But more about that later.Bought these from a grocery store and a third of the box was broken. These are very fragile. I like to dip my cookies in milk or a cup of tea and when you do, an awful lot of fat appears on the top of the liquid. You cant eat more than a couple of these without serious guilt.As you chew, a weird slimy texture coats your tongue. I wondered if i had bitten into a mollusc of some kind but its the xanthum gum. If you add too much, you are left with this weird unctuous shitake mushroom slug texture. Cookies ended up in the trash.The lemon flavor is better as the tangy lemon acidity washes away the effect of the xanthum gum but the pecan is too sweet and fails to counterbalance it."
3,Arrived as crumbs,"The cookies are delicious and have purchased them in the past. This time, however, they arrived with half of the cookies as crumbs. In addition, one section only had two cookies and not three. Very disappointed this time and am not sure I will order them again."
2,just another cookie - not a true shortbread,"This is just another cookie, not terrible, but definitely not shortbread. If you are looking for a true shortbread, buy Walkers. It's the only one I've found for a reasonable price."
2,not great,These cookies are essentially tasteless. I do eat them but after one the consistency is weird kind of mushy. The Betty Crocker chocolate chip mix is a zillion times better....except you have to bake. ;)
3,lotsa delicious crumbs,no complaints on the quality of cookies.out of 9 cookies in a box i only came across 4 sometimes 5 whole cookies. the rest were all crumbled to pieces and i had to use a coffee spoon to enjoy the rest of the crumbs. I could see 1 or 2 boxes in this bad condition but all of them ? YIKES !!! I hesitate to order it again. I was gonna use 2 boxes as gifts but just not gonna happen. I wonder if AMAZON got a good deal from the company. That's why the 3 stars otherwise it would have been a 5 stars.
5,Excellent anthology,"This yearly collection of short stories in a rather short time (only the third annual anthology) has lived up to its title of being the best. The current collection includes a modern day who's who of American authors that run the gamut of the mystery genre and beyond. Each story works as an exciting entity all its own, but adds to the overall freshness of the collection.Fans of short stories will love this anthology that includes works by Block, Deaver, Estleman, Gorman, Oates, Updike, etc. among the nineteen tales. 1999 THE BEST AMERICAN MYSTERY STORIES is a winning short story collection because the editors widen the genre barriers while including nineteen strong tales. There is not one loser among the contributions."
4,"some good,some bad,almost the finest in mysteryfiction.","I love almost every story McBain has chosen.But I do regret not finding in this anthology a Hunter/Marsten/Collins/Cannon story from the Master,himself.(He reads on the audio,though....)"
4,Not bad ... not bad at all,"I only recently discovered Die Toten Hosen, and I have become quite fond of Unsterblich. I have listened to a fair amount of their older music, and though some of it is also good, I really find Unsterblich to be their best. I don't really know whom I should compare them to - some of my other favorite bands are Radiohead, Tool, and Pink Floyd, so I'm not very familiar with 'punk' (though I wouldn't call Unsterblich punk at all). Wofür man lebt, Helden und Diebe, and Unsterblich are truly great. :)"
4,Good German music,"I don't know if I would like this so much if I hadn't spent the year in Germany, but I do anyway. My favourites are Unser Haus and Wofür das Leben zählt aswell as the singles (Bayern, Unsterblich, Schön sein). I wouldn't say all the songs are brilliant, but even enough that you never need to skip them."
5,A triumph!,"The hosen have again come out with a wonderful new album, ""UNSTERBLICH"". There are a lot of punk type sounds, and most pleasingly, some gorgeous orchestra music on a few pieces. Normally most bands will lose their luster after 2 or three albums, but I'm happy to report that those magnificent Hosen although the sound has changed a little bit, they are still as good as the old hosen, if not better. This new album is a must have to your collection!"
1,Very cheaply made,"These nails work with my Hitachi 45N, but not well at all. The heads bend often and do not always come out consistently. Put the money out for name brand nails."
2,Difficult to put together,"The holes were not drilled straight or big enough, so we needed to drill them out further. Even then, the badly made screws and screwdriver were so difficult to use that my son could not put it together himself. He asked for help, and even I could not drive many of the screws. We'll get out the drill later and try that way.This is supposed to be a toy for kids to assemble and use themselves, but the poor quality of the materials makes that impossible."
2,Not sure IF this was an Authentic Product?,"While the pricing was good, the sole started to peel on the back. The sneaker had a ""P"" on the side and NOT like my previous pair that has ""Propet"" spelled out in full on the side."
1,don't wear when it's the slightest bit wet,"These shoes don't stand up to normal wear. The soles are separating after three months, the tops are splitting at the seams, and the left shoe has a section cut out of the sole. These are the worst walking shoes I have ever purchased. Buyer beware! These are $40 shoes at best."
1,No support,I am returning these shoes. I don'tknow if they are mismarked but much too wide. After wearing for two weeks shoes are turning in. No support.
5,Just as expected,"exactly what I wanted, perfect fit, would recommend to others who wear orthopedic insoles in their shoes - plenty of room."
5,It's great!,"It has been about 12 years since I first time listened to some songs from this album, and I still love them.I don't speak Italian,but it doesn't matter,the musik is great. Vlad."
1,not very good,This book has made it easy for me to get the basics of stock purchaseing and technical analysis. Would recommend to any type of trader who wants a clear way to understand how to get an edge on other traders.
3,"Good, but not great...","I think this book is great for people who are first learning how to invest in the stock market. The concepts he discusses are very simple to understand. However, it does lack some important details about the market in general. It definitely lacks one important detail when it comes to shorting stocks. He offers some good tips on what to look for when shorting stocks, but offers little advice on when to cover. For novice investors, this book would be a good consideration only as a supplement to reading other books on investing."
4,Educational & Fun,"Best Motoring International is always a show that is very technical, but still very fun for even the automotive novice. They teach you about the cars, show you their strengths and weaknesses, and then they pit them against other cars of the same class, and explain why they did well, or not so well. I consider BMI to be the best show to watch in terms in automotive knowledge, and even fun. It's also fun to see the touge racing and the highly tuned cars race, and to see the driving techniques you need to harness in order to control such dangerous cars and conditions."
4,Notes from the author:,"Mythos merges with history in a mind bending saga.Here is mainsteam thought with a twist from the future; a taste of history, mystery and our deepest doubts."
4,Ken Dryden and the 1972 Summit Series,"Hard book to find since it is out of print, but I received it from a dealer on the west coast. I enjoyed the stories tremendously. The book itself was used and well worn, but still very readable. First-hand accounts on this series are always the best."
