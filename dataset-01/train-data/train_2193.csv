3,disappointed,"The picture clearly shows the red sox logo (socks) on the sleeve. I was disappointed to see that it did not actually have it on it when it arrived. other than that, nice jacket."
4,Nice for the money,"I am quite happy with this model as I believe you get what you pay for. I agree that they should probably not call it 'die-cast' but it is, in my book, definitely worth the $25 or so I paid for it."
5,"1/6 scale Blown fuel SOHC ""cammer"" Ford 427","It my shop with my street rod and other rat rod and race car projectsthese make a great display and the quality and detail is fantastic....If you ever watched one of these or better yet were in thestaging lanes as they fired up beside your car in thelate 60s you never would forget them.... Several top name driversfrom today started with this engine powering their cars,its a realpart of racing History and deserves a lot of respect...Watched a Mustang Gasser staged next to us with a blown ""Cammer""stuffed into it, what a joy that was...He gave our injected Hemi powered digger some thoughts butwe top ended him by several lengths and 25 mph more...."
1,99% of time die cast means metal,"I have been buying from Amazon almost as long as there has been an Amazon. I have purchased hundreds of items and spent thousands of dollars. I have never been disappointed with anything from Amazon until now. This model was described as die cast.I am also a collector of die cast vehicles,when most manufacturers say ""die cast"" they mean mostly metal. The only metal on this model were the screws that hold it to the stand. Besides the lack of any metal parts, some of the plastic pieces which were chromed have the chrome partially off. Some of the glued on some pieces can be seen and some assemblies such as the blower are loose.There were other engine models I have thought about buying, not anymore ! Be sure if it says ""die cast"",it is ""die cast"""
5,A 'must' for the legions of Grace Kelly fans,"Born to a wealthy and competitive Philadelphia family, Grace Kelly was a lovely and talented woman who went from model, to stage and television actress, to movie star, to becoming the Princess of Monaco. Ably narrated by Richard Kiley, ""Grace Kelly: The American Princess"" is part of the Janson Media 'The Hollywood Collection' DVD series and presents the life and death of one of America's most beloved celebrities. This one-hour biography is enhanced further with the inclusion of a Grace Kelly Photo Gallery; an interview with filmmaker Gene Feldman about Grace Kelly which aired on the television show 'Good Morning America'; and a 'Meet the Producers' segment. ""Grace Kelly: The American Princess"" is a 'must' for the legions of Grace Kelly fans and would make a popular addition to community library DVD collections."
5,Grace Kelly .... the Blonde European Jackie O,"Grace Kelly was the prized debutant of Philadelphia as Jackie Bouvier was to New York Society. A cool, crisp, classy and collected blonde counterpart to Jackie's raven mystique ... Grace Kelly exuded the same athletic and sophisticated image that took her to Hollywood and later Monaco. If Jackie was America's Queen ... Grace was a true Princess even if she had to leave the US to wear a crown."
4,"GRACE KELLY, AMERICAN PRINCESS",I enjoyed this biography on Princess Grace very much. It did show some private scenes of the Princess that I had never seen before.
4,Blast from the BAY,"Many bands have dreamed of making a record that is a combination of Exile on Main Street and Physical Graffiti. Few could pull it off. You get a feeling that something was up like this for Big Midnight when they recorded the songs for ""Everything For The First Time."" Big Midnight is a band from San Francisco. Some of them were in the Richmond Sluts. The lead singer reminds me of Iggy. Many people in NYC might be familiar with The Witnesses. Bid Midnight seem like they are taking music a step further. They take all the lessons of garage rock and british music and do something really interesting. They were one of the few bands that shook up the place at the recent LA Shakedown. Every song on this record is a hit. I could see them with many backup singers and a brass section. Things can only get better and better for Big Midnight. I look forward to seeing them play live again.(...)"
4,Moon etiquette for the inexperienced...,"What would you do if the moon offered you a ride? If you're not sure, then this is the book for you. With matter-of-fact humor, Harriet Ziefert shows the reader what and what not to do if you are fortunate enough to catch a moonride. The muted colors of the simple illustrations contribute to its bedtime appropriateness, while the background texture and visible crayon strokes add interest to capture the attention. And by bringing the intangible into the realm of a child's every day world, this pleasant picture book is sure to encourage good dreams and a healthy imagination."
2,Cap Catastrophe,"liked the idea but not the product, thought it would be better constructed, was not up to standards that I have come to expect"
3,Too Tight,"The items was just as pictured on Amazon, but it was entirely too small for an adults head. I even adjusted it, it gave me a migraine so I really just wasted my money but it was as pictured."
3,Just an FYI,"This film has also been released as a special Director's Cut under the title Highlander, The Final Dimension. It would have been nice if the studio made that a little clearer on the package, rather than just change the title and leave it to the consumer to figure it out."
1,And the series continues it's downward spiral ...,"And the series continues it's downward spiral ...Why even bother putting the time and energy to putting this onto celluloid?""I have a great idea. I would like to make it into a classic movie and then kill the theme be redoing it to death in horrible sequels!""""What is the Idea Called?""""Highlander.""""Sounds great, let's make a great movie and a horrible TV show that is nothing like the movie and film sequels that squash the life out of your 'immortal' tale?""""Okay. Where do I sell my soul?""THE END"
4,necro is a f*cked up white boy,"this album is crazy hott...necro is a better producer than rapper..as well with alot of other artists.....his flow is lacking style n he sounds the same on every track, both in style n content....but thats not ta say that this album is still dope...its violent, disgusting n sumtimes humorous lyrics make this album a dark, yet eerily entertainin album ta listen ta.....ma favorite tracks on this record wud hafta be underground, i need drugs, which is a hilarious version of ll cool j's ""i need love"", and the most sadistic, as i have been a fan of ill bill n his group, non phixion fer a long time now (fer those who are interested ta know, necro handles alot of non phixions beats)...if you liked any of necro's other albums, you will like this since he has not really changed his style of production or rapping from this album, i need drugs through to brutality part 1 in 2003...pick it up...it is worth a listen ta"

4,"Very nice, well constructed, fits both regular and widemouth jars.","Very nice, well constructed, fits both regular and wide mouth jars.Took 1 star for sharp edge @ bottom of funnel.Fits regular mouth jars snug, wide slightly loose.Very wide @ top of funnel, this is good.Handle is welded to funnel, looks like it will last a lifetime.Well polished on outside, not polished on inside.Thank you,Kris"
5,ELMO'S SILLY FACES IS AWESOME,I bought this item for my grandson who just turned 3 and he never puts it down. It is really cute and very durable. We love it!
2,Biggest Piece of Fluf In My Library,"This book is 199 pages of fluffy copywriting. There's no substance!I'll find myself reading a section that feels like a long winded introduction, then...POOF...onto the next topic. Over and over again.The target audience of this book (Designers) is too broad. Because of that, everything is vague generalizations. Maybe Goldfarb could write about some specifics if the demographic was narrowed down to only one of the following: Graphic Designers, Multimedia Designers, Freelance Designers, etc.If you need this book to tell you that a resume and portfolio are important to finding a new job, then by all means, pick up a copy. But if you've taken ANY classes in design or have ANY work experience, don't waste your time..."
4,Good sleeve,"I have purchased these recipe binder sleeves many times. I am pleased overall but mainly because I have grown to accept them. I have a ""new seasons"" cookbook that doesn't provide enough sheets nor do they sell refills so I had a tough time trying to find pocket sleeves that matched the original as well as fit good. These do not match exactly because my original sleeves had a slit on the tops. These open from the left side and are actually a bit smaller so I have to cut my recipes down a bit. Be aware though that the picture for this product does not represent it very well. If you look at the picture it looks as if there is NO space between the binder holes & the opening, this is misleading because in fact there is about 1/3 inch space in between which is unattractive and a waste of space. I will continue to buy."
4,Present,"Got this for a gift for my future daughter in law. She absolutely loved it! Spent the entire time at our home at Christmas..sorting recipes, gathering more & filing them away! It was HUGE hit!"
3,Seller needs a better description,"These are not quite what I anticipated getting. Looking at the picture, they look identical to the pages I am trying to get more of, which come out of a big binder called ""The Family Recipe Collection Book"" that I received as a gift. These ended up being bigger than the ones that came with my book. Please read the review where the reviewer gives dimensions, as the seller does not. The space where the holes are is much wider (as indicated in a couple of other reviews). This made it stick out farther. Also, the ones that came with my book fits cards on both sides of the sleeve; this one you can only use the front side. These open on the side too, which I find a little harder to use, and as I turn the pages of my book, the cards slide out the side opening. I prefer the top opening in my originals."
5,Perfect for our needs,These binder pockets were perfect to two add to our receipt binder. They were easy to order and they arrived in great shape.
5,amazing,"how has no one reviewed this? i know im not the only one to adore this piece of electronic love. throw on this gem and get intimate with that loved one. for fans of cex, stars as eyes, ellen allien, telefon tel aviv, styrofoam, the notwist, postal service...etc etc"
4,Apparat - Duplex,"One could imagine that Sascha Ring, better known as Apparat, had in mind the organic and electronic when he named his album _Duplex_, because he certainly shares in both. Even though the opening track, ""Granular Bastard,"" is all studio trickery and hissing, skittering percussion, ""Contradiction"" brings in a simple guitar around which the song builds, with the plaintive vocals coming in later. The winding and rewinding of ""Wooden"" add a certain melancholy to the track (the airy vocals help as well, of course). ""Schallstrom"" mixes harpsichord with some crispy rhythms, while ""Cerro Largo"" reprocesses guitars, sounding similar to Telefon Tel Aviv. The wild jazz saxophone of ""Negro Modelo"" adds a completely unexpected twist right at the end of the album. Once you move into the _Duplex_, you'll find it hard to leave."
4,George's best pop tunes with nod to jazz roots.,"This collection spot lights George's best pop tunes and acknowledges his jazz roots with cuts from White Rabbit, Other Side of Abby Road, and Breezin'. Great guitar work and soulful vocals show why George has been so popular with both jazz and popular music fans for nearly 4 decades. Highly recommended."
4,Definetly shows Benson's best,"This album shows all of George Benson's hits. Although a few songs are harder to find as good as others, all of them are great. I especially like ""White Rabbit,"" which is a tune with a style of great cool jazz and some touches of Mexican music. The disc shows other famous tunes like ""Broadway"" or ""Give Me the Night."" I think if you want some good, popular jazz, this disc is for you!"
5,GEORGE BENSON RULES!!! GEORGE BENSON RULES!! KABOOOM!!!,"George Benson is AWESOME, AWESOME I TELL YA! HE'S THE MASTER OF SINGING AND GUITARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE IS THE JAZZ GOD!!!!! With great classics like ""Turn Your Love Around"", ""Give Me the Night, ""Never Give Up On A Good Thing"", ""On Broadway"", ""This Masquerade"", ""Breezin"", and ""Last Train To Clarksville"","
3,US Title - Long Blond Animal,"This album was released in the US as Long Blond Animal. It's an OK Golden Earring album of the era. If you are looking for a CD copy to bring your collection up to date, it has the same songs as Long Blond Animal, just in differnt order."
4,They change their sound again.,"Golden Earring ""Prisoner Of The Night"" DNC (1980).The 80's opened up good for Golden Earring here, ""Long Blond Animal"", opens this disc with one of their best rockers in a few years. ""My Town"", is pure power-pop. Other good songs are ""Will + Mercy"", the title track, ""Going Crazy Again"" and ""No For An Answer"". ""Cut"", would bring them back to the charts in 1982."
1,Not for the True Idiot,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I was truly looking for a geography book for idiots. What I was hoping for was a book that I could go to a map of any country and see important cities, rivers, mountains and other pertinent facts. This is not that book. The Index is HORRIBLE! I do crossword puzzles and they often have clues for relatively unknown countries. You cannot find them is this book. The index does not list all of the countries, and if they are listed the maps are terrible. The maps are very small and use real fine print. I have 20/20 vision and absolutely cannot read the names of cities on these maps. I cannot say enough bad about this book. This IS NOT a book for geographical idiots."
5,What a great story!,"The Incumbent is a thoroughly enjoyable story.Brian McGrory creates characters you can see and feel, real, three-dimensional people with flaws and virtues that make them complex and interesting. The hero, Jack Flynn has a dry wit and a past that makes you cheer for him. Other characters, many of whom are not clearly Jack's friend or foe, are equally well-developed.McGrory's knowledge and experience dealing with the insiders in Washington is in full view, as he crafts a credible, gripping tale, street smart, fast moving and with a satisfying finish that will leave you looking for his next book.For me, his next book can't come soon enough."
4,I Couldn't Put It Down,"This fast-paced political thriller is what most books of this type are not -- written by someone who actually seems to know the worlds of politics and journalism. The voices of all the characters ring true, and from the most despicable to the most alluring I enjoyed meeting all of them. The jolts in the book were true, timed right, and absent the detour to implausibility taken by so many who try their hand at thriller fiction. The frequent asides, stage whispers really, to the reader also worked -- many provoked out loud laughter. All told, I couldn't put it down and hope this is not Mr. McGrory's last foray into political thrillers."
5,A timely thriller that robbed me of a good night's sleep!,"Brian McGrory, I'm very sleepy as I write this, as I was up till 3a.m. last night finishing your new book, THE INCUMBENT. A great thriller, it also gives an inside look at what a journalist's life can be like. I'm a big John Grisham reader, and I loved this book even more than Grisham's last few. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a suspenseful, well-written read. So keep going, Brian McGrory!"
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"Brian McGrory really shined with this book! It was about a newspaper reporter who was trying to earn respect in the newspaper business. It had a slow start but gave you a wonderful finish. For anyone who has followed the 'Deep Throat' story, this will be a deeply interesting read."
1,Walter Mitty Journalist,"This was obviously written by a journalist with a journalists typically inflated since of professional importance. It required a pretty good imagination, and I don't know many sailors with as obscene a vocabulary as nearly every one in the book. Barely a paragraph is without the ""F word"". I had to be very careful about reading it in front of my newly reading sons, out of fear for being asked to define words that are best left undefined."
1,Don't trust their recommendations... THEY ARE WRONG,I ordered TWO High Capacity toner cartridges (yellow and cyan). On both i checked their drop down selection feature to be sure i was getting the right one for my printer. There info said YES . Well they were WRONG. Both cartridges were NOT for my printer and i had a NIGHTMARE for two weeks trying to figure out the problem and they kept assuring that it was correct. My printer kept giving me a message that my printer did not support the cartridge. Finally Xerox confirmed that the cartridge was the WRONG one. So i go back to their page on Amazon and put in both cartridge numbers just to test it and it say BOTH are correct. SHEESH.. what a wasted two weeks with clients waiting for work. I would not trust buying from TonerGalore ever again.
5,Works,Not much to say but its a good mirror. I used it in Iraq to cut my own hair. Lasted the whole deployment.
5,The Best Soundtrack In The Entire UNIVERSE!,Before I bought the soundtrack I was watching the movie and came to the part where Luke is on the open Plateau by his house and the twin suns are setting. The music came on and it gave me goosebumps. I started to rewind that part again and again until I went out and bought the soundtrack. I like it because it is very relaxing and fun to imagine the scenes of the movie while listening to the soundtrack. John Williams is THE BEST!
5,Great Buy Worth Every Cent!,"This soundtrack is great! The music or Star Wars has always enchanted me. I am so glad it came out on CD! The best track on it by far however is ""Cantina Band"" which is the music played in the Mos Eisleys Bar, in which Luke meets Han Solo!A great buy worth every cent!"
4,"A Long time ago , in a galxey far, far away","It was grat ! ,but I think that the music on the reail video was better"
3,Mediocre,"This Soundtrack has some good songs in it. But, they play the charachters themes hundreds of times. It gets to be a bore. It's not worth the money. Unless your a star wars collector."
4,"A good score, but...","Okay, let's get this straight - I love Star Wars, I love the movies, I love the music, and I absolutely love everything John Williams has done. The only reason I gave this score 4 stars was because I feel that the Empire Strikes Back score is better. If it were possible, I'd've given ESB 5 and ANH 4.9, but since that isn't possible, this is what I had to do. It is a wonderful score, an essential addition to any fan of Star Wars or John Williams (I'm both) and includes a few cool extras that weren't included in the movies (along with everything that WAS in the movies, complete and in order). Bottom line - if you just want a couple discs of Star Wars, go for Empire Strikes Back. Otherwise, get them all - I'm sure you'll love them."
1,Item description is misleading,"This ebook contains ONLY Poems and Ballads, Series I -- not, as the item description states, a much larger compilation of works. The compilation as described would be a bargain at the price; not so this single work. Would-be readers of Swinburne are advised to look elsewhere."
4,The Mystery on the Mysterly,"I just got the book yesterday. Read it all. While I had read most of the story on www.Clockworkstorybook.com before I bought the book, I didn't get to finish it.It was worth every penny. It is a fun read. There is a ton of adventure and humor on every page. It's twisted in just the right way.I recommend this book to anyone who likes ERB, Heinlein's juveniles, and just plain reading. A book for everyone in the family."
3,Mysterly River Good Not Great,"This book starts off very well, leaving reader in wonder about what happens next. It unfortunately slows down and gets rough to follow for a while. Thankfully, it later picks up. I'm a huge Fables and Peter & Max fan and while I enjoyed ""Down the Mysterly River"", I know Bill Willingham can do better."
4,Quite the story but a bit hard to read for intended age group,"The story is impressive, magical and engaging. The characters, both big and small, inspire a sense of warmth while you still aren't sure what to make of them or their actions. The author allows you to feel compassion on both sides of the coin from both the hunted and the hunters. Part of the toolbox used to create such effects is a vastly deep vocabulary that may leave some readers unable to read the story or just left to look a decent amount of the words in a dictionary.I found the book's writing and dependence on unusual vocabulary to be distracting at times--especially when reading the story to my son, but well readers will likely enjoy the break from the simple 8th grade writing found in most modern adult books these days."
4,Great children's literature: entertaining story and meaningful themes,"Thoroughly entertaining read with strong, archetypal characters. On its surface, ""Down the Mysterly River"" is a cracking, Kipling-esque adventure tale. At a deeper level, the ""typical"" Willingham themes of the delineation of reality and story, the damage of revisionism (perhaps George Lucas should read this?), and the relation between creator and character are explored at a readable level. The end is especially satisfying without being maudlin. While a complete tale in and of itself, I would welcome future adventures in the Heroes Woods. The simple ink-wash illustrations are well-done and bring the story to life."
4,Not a typical children's book,"The characters were great and seemed very familiar and relatable making the book personal, and about 1/2 way through I had to finish it and could not put it down. I am rarely surprised by books and this one took longer to figure out, which I was thrilled with. I really enjoyed this book and would buy it an recommend it to friends.This book is not your typical kids book and I would recommend it be for young adults instead, because there is a lot in this book that could be scary or need explanation. However, it is full of foreshadowing, symbolism and other great literary elements."
4,Middle Grade Fantasy Adventure,"Down the Mysterly River reminded me of the Wizard of Oz books and The Neverending Story in concept and writing style. It is very much a whimsical fantasy with talking animals and a child in danger, attempting to figure out the reason why they are where they are in the first place.Max, the protagonist of the story finds himself in a forest without any memory of how he got there. Eventually he finds companions in the way of a badger, a cat and a bear. There is a lot of fun storytelling and it's interesting enough to keep children as well as adults interested (as long as you enjoy fantasy type themes).The ending reminded me of another book with a similar ending, making me feel a little cheated. It was sort of ""What? it was a dream"" type feeling (no, it's not a dream), but it didn't ruin the story for me. Overall it was a fun read, sure to delight fantasy lovers and excellent for a read aloud."
5,Fictional Folks,"I read this book in under 3 days. It's a marvelous fantasy with a bigger message on creativity. I encourage any who dreamed of putting pen to paper and writing a novel to pick up ""Mysterly."" You'll love the sheer joy that shines through as the writer crafts his tale. It's rare to see an author show such affection toward his gifted characters."
4,"Awesome book, but the reader's voice for audio CD irritating!","The book is wonderfully written. However, it was so hard to listen to this book on audio CD. The reader sounds like he has cotton mouth, so he clicks and smacks a lot. I could only listen for short periods because it was irritating. I have never heard a voice so irritating to listen to!"
1,Worthless,"This book is similar to the series of books on Indian languages normally published as ""Learn (insert name of Indian language) through English."" This book might be adequate for Indians that want to learn Konkani, but a foreigner with no background in Indian languages and without familiarity with the Devnagari alphabet will be totally lost, right from the rather impressionistic description of the pronunciation and on through the bowdlerized grammatical explanations.The real shame is that there is no other book for learning Konkani readily available. Wait until there is, or else learn Marathi, which is close enough to get you started, and then just work your way around conversations with Goans."
1,Bad presentation,"The book is a very discouraging one .. It seems to be giving a ""grammatical"" treatment of the language - certainly not a good way to learn a new language!"
3,Beware - 0% funk!,"The CD's title ""100% pure funk"" is completely misleading - this album doesn't contain a single funk track. Instead we get a bunch of swinging organ tracks with sax and guitar from the 60ies. The CD is nice if you are into this type of jazz but in case you are after the funk stuff from Jimmy McGriff (""Outside Looking In"", ""Tailgunner"" etc.) then this album is definitely NOT for you."
5,Great introduction to gifted kids,"The preservcie teachers in my gifted education class at OISE/UT have found Being Smart About Gifted Children to be a very good guide in their efforts to understand gifted children. As their instructor, I appreciate the current research and practical ideas, which are communicated eloquently in straightforward prose. Thus, I would strongly recommend this book to teachers and parents interested in learning more about the psychology and education of highly able learners."
5,A very nice children's book,"This story is about a frog who doesn't like flies, and takes off to find the food that he likes. What happens after that provides a nice moral and a good story. The writing and illustrations are top-notch, and both of my boys love reading it."
4,Christmas Tree bag,"It's a pretty big bag. I used it for a 7' tree and had room to spare. Not much to say about it, it's a Christmas Tree Bag. It probably could be made sturdier, but I haven't poked any holes into it yet."
4,good enough,"The bag was big enough and seems pretty durable, the handles didn't look that strong which concerns me, we'll see how long it lasts"
2,Cheap storage bag,"I was barely able to get my seven foot tree into the bag without the zipper breaking. It is a very flimsy bag, you get what you pay. I would not recommend it."
2,Big Bag,"Thought this would be a little bit more compact than the box the tree came in, but it's not. It's bigger and bulkier. Only used it this year, but seems like the tree is going to rip right through it."
4,Large Bag!,"This bag was low priced and what I ended up needing, I have a 7 foot, 3 piece tree. The tree fit with more than enough room, the bag was actually to big."
1,Don't Bother,After placing my 7ft tree into the bag I tried to move it and the straps ripped. I contacted the seller and have yet to get a reply (which has been over 2 weeks). I am in the process of contacting Amazon to make a complaint since the seller has yet to reply.
1,Bad News!!,"The item pictured is not the item sent!! I followed instructions for returning and did so on Jan. 22, via priority mail, to Lea Manter/Returns, 2 Whispering Wind Rd., York ME 03909. I e-mailed Lea multiple times but she claims she never received it. Unfortunately I didn't send Receipt-Requested. That $10 item has now cost me $22!!"
2,Tree Storage bag,The storage bag was too small despite saying it fit up to a 7 1/2 ft. artificial tree.
3,Served the purpose,"The storage bag was very big. It had enough room for my 6"" tree and lots of other stuff! It's not the strudiest but I can definitely work with it!"
3,Tree bag,"The tree bag is very bulky. It had a plastic""y"" smell for a while. I would not purchase it again nor would I recommend it to a friend."
1,Poor quality,Handles ripped off the first time the bag was picked up with the tree in it. It's junk.
3,Not quite as advertised.,"We deliberately chose an opaque, green bag. We received a white, semi-transparent bag. When I called the company, I was transferred to customer service voice mail, and was never called back. We decided to just be satisfied with what we have because it is easy to fill with a full length zipper, and it does seem to be strong enough, especially for the price."
1,Keep shopping -- this is not worth the $$!,"I just packed away our 7' tree today. The zipper broke the first time we tried to zip the bag. Then, while carrying the bag up into the attic, the metal rods of our tree tore right through the bag! Well it's packed away now, but looks like we'll be buying another bag next year (from a different manufacturer)."
1,Don't Believe What they tell you!!,I just recieved the bag. It only holds a 7 ft tree not a up to a 9 ft tree.
3,Voltage problems,"Grate item, except for one unfortunate quality of all current li-ion rechargeable batteries. Fully charged, battery offers 4.23V! It was enough to burn couple of Nichia white LEDs, wreck hawock with LED emitter flashlight driver, and even seriously incapacitate Nikon SLR camera! When manually discharged to about 4V (probably to 2/3 of total capacity) all came to normal. So, be aware, this is 4.23 - 3.6 V battery!"
1,Save your money,"These batteries dont last any longer then the disposable ones. They do not recharge 300 times. I was able to use the batteries for a total of 10 rolls of film over a 2 month period. Then a very important family event comes up and wouldnt you know it, the rechargeable batteries will no longer recharge!"
3,good,"Another slept on artist. Though his production could have been better, he has talent. A new jack classic."
5,A nice replacement....,"We had a mailbox attached to our railing and it continued to move, despite being resecured often...resulting in rust and paint touch ups.We decided to get a through the door mailbox. Our door is solid maple, so we did not need the sleeve. We did need to touch up the cut out with an oil protecting stain.If you do have hollow doors, get the sleeve.Delivery was on time, but we did have to wait to the stated date of arrival, longer than Amazon itself would deliver."
3,Generally good,Generally good. The brass was shiny and bright and the stamping excellent. On the downside the spring was too strong and had to be disabled or the mail slot functionality would be impaired.
3,A little bit leaky,"The finish and sturdiness of this is good, however, this is not very good for energy efficiency. Lots of air can come in through small gaps."
3,Mail slot,"The mail slot was the right size, but the finish was very different looking in person compared to the picture. I would actually like to return it and get the correct finish. It doesn't match my other hardware on the door, and by the picture I really thought that it was the same. But I got the shipment very promptly and I love ordering from Amazon. Usually the item is like I expect. This is the first time it wasn't."
1,Not solid brass.,"Upon installing this mailslot, I discovered that it was not solid brass but brass plate. Rather than thank me for alerting them to this, Deerso dinged me 30% restocking fee because it was a week over their return window. Not recommended! Not solid brass!"
4,Dramatic Intensity!,"Waltraud Meier is one my favorite singers in the world and this CD shows why. Singing the great arias of Wagner heroines, she combines voice, emotion, and intellect in a series of breathtaking performances. Her rendition of Senta's aria from ""The Flying Dutchman"" is incredible - and makes me yearn to hear her sing this on stage. Of course, also included is her signature role of Kundry. She brings so much more to this role than is on the page. Her identification with this character is apparent. This CD also includes a great Narrative & Curse from ""Tristan und Isolde"", filled with great emotion, and even some lovely legato. To hear her sing this, she simply becomes one with the character. This is a GREAT recording by one of the great Wagnerian singers of our generation."
5,9-11 truth and lies,"In my view, there are many questions concerning the events of 9-11 that have gone unanswered. The American people have never been toldthe truth. Authors and investigative reporters such as Michael Ruppert deserve our thanks for opening our eyes to what really took place. Most ofus are content to accept the official stories as they are fed to us by the major media sources most of whom fail to ask the tought questions and demandanswers. The real threats to our freedoms and future do not reside in far away lands but within our own borders within the ranks of the rich and powerfulwho have their own plans.."
3,BAD FILMING,THE FILMING WAS ON THE ORDER OF SOME PRESCHOOL DOING IT.WAS VERY HARD TO STAY FOCUS ON THE SUBJECT MATTER.
1,terrible,It was not anything of what I expected. There was no information of interest; unless one has a strange interest in hearing this man talk about himself.
2,May I know if there's spanish subtitles in this documental?,"Language barreer is one of the most critical line between worlds. I don't understand why companies don't add subtitles, at least in the main languages. it's a truly pain."
1,9/11 Documentary,This cover on the DVD box is decieving. This is a classroom lecture presentation i wished i had returned it but i waited too long to open it. I was very dissapointed
1,Yawn,"Anyone can make a movie or write a book about all the conspiracy theories, but it is their words, their twisted truth. I would never believe that President Bush or our government would kill so many people in the USA to start a war for oil, etc. Puhlease!!!! I have heard more cr@ p about steel beams made from a weak compound, etc. If I believed everything everyone wrote about their ""findings"", I would literally go mad. Excuse me....just how do you know how a plane would/should explode when it hits two World Trade Center buildings. It didn't blow out the right way, it didn't catch fire the right way....shove your theories...unless you caused those planes to kill all those people and that's how you can explain it so well."
3,Okay,These grips were very small with small holes in them. They work after enlarging the holes. We probable would have purchased a larger size if we had known how small they were.
1,THESE ARE CHILDREN'S SIZES !!,I guess that the assumption of 'Grips Etc' is that only children are beginners therefore the beginner style grips are only available in a style cut for children. I suppose you can cut them to fit your fingers but the width is still quite small for preventing blisters from a pull up bar. I will be returning these and looking around for a different option.
5,I couldnt believe it at first but YES it works !,I LOVED this book ... and I love what it has done for my sociallife ...5 stars for a book on feng shui that directly offers a greatmany NEW tips ! the few I tried sure worked for me. so I recommend this book highly.
5,You absolutely must try this book if you want to find love,I tried it... it worked within one month.
4,Great intro to Barbers'Adagio,"I found this recording while continuing my search for my all-time favorite version of the Adagio.While nothing on this album approaches the perfection of my favorite recording,it is a wonderful collection of the various treatments of Barbers'work.I find the vocal ensemble to be the most satisfying but found that,really the appeal of this cd is the movement from one version to the next.I have listened to as many versions as I can find of the Adagio and I finally found the version that is Perfect in all aspects of the piece:the 1957 recording by the Philadelphia Orchestra,conducted by Eugene Ormandy.It can only be found on a Sony release entitled""American Masterpieces"".It is the definitive recording in my opinion,and I am a hardcore fan of the Adagio!"
2,The song makes the CD,"The Barber Adagio is not supposed to be so incredibly short. Some of the best recordings (including the Baltimore Symphony and the Bernstein) last 10 minutes in length! Unfortunately some of the groups on this CD just tear through the piece (4:52?!) The Boston Symphony Orchestra does a nice job with the piece but they still play it too quickly (just under 8 minutes). This piece requires such control to play and, unfortunately, most of the groups that perform it on this CD do not display that. The choral version of this piece is truly magnificent but listeners would do better to get the CD ""Agnus Dei"" (Gregorio Allegri) which includes a beautiful version of the Barber along with a wonderful collection of other songs. For an instrumental version of the Barber listeners need go no further than the Thomas Schippers version which is perhaps the most beautiful recording of the piece ever made."
4,Classical and Beautiful,"I have heard this music many times and could not find out a name until I heard it being played on Yahoo Radio and was able to see a name, etc. I immediately went to Amazon to locate - took a little while but my persistence paid off. If your looking for something to smooth ruffles edges - this is for you or if you just love beautiful music - this is it!"
3,Practice Pad,"OK. It's not OK. It's Great. My drumming needs alot of practice, I'm new to drumming. This pad lets me hit and softly hear it, trying to get my rythem down. I'm sure glad I bought it"
2,Options?,"I rented this video because I wanted to test it out before buying it. I rented it from my Vizio (with Wifi) thinking that I would have some of the options other reviewers have noted (e.g., Christmas music). I really like the look of the fireplace, and enjoy the crackling sounds but I haven't been able to figure out how to get the other options (hence, my 2 star rating). Maybe it's because I bought the instant video version...perhaps to get the options I need to buy the actual DVD? I don't know. If anyone has suggestions on how to get these options on my Vizio, please leave a comment. Thanks!"
2,Ultimate Fireplace DVD,"This was given to us as a gift after purchasing a new HDTV. My husband & I were soon disappointed because we could not figure out how to switch between the different modes as there were no instructions to follow (as with other DVDs we've used).Although the fire looks nice (HD? not so sure), we found a different fireplace DVD on Amazon that we enjoy much more."
5,Truely The BEST !!!,"My mom bought this for me as a surprise and it has 3 fires to choose from. Holiday, Campfire and a Fireplace that reflects in the glass doors. Very well done!"
4,our grandkids loved it,"TO BE HONEST, I BOUGHT THIS AS A JOKE TO PLAY WHILE WE OPENED CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. WE ALL LOVED IT, ESPECIALLY MY GRANDSON WHO SAT ON THE COUCH AND STARED AT IT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. IT HAS A CALMING EFFECT AND AFTER A WHILE I FORGET THAT IT'S NOT THE REAL THING. NOW WE PLAY IT IN THE EVENING WHEN THE COLD NORTHWEST RAIN IS LASHING PORTLAND.THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE IS EXCELLENT. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT I CAN'T HEAR THE CRACKLING OF THE FIRE VERY WELL. OTHERWISE, EXCELLENT!"
1,old and glitchy,"the 770 is glitchy, most programs are not avaible for download now a days, the few u do find dont even work. programs always shut down when ur trying to do somthing. i hope they fixxed these probs on the new one but 770 dont buy. to old and to under power for modern web use. oh, its linux base."
3,Not Yet a Keeper,Ordered this from Nokia and kept it two days. The positive is ease of WiFi internet connection and bright screen. Applications are not state of the art and it does not permit connection to all cell phones (it connected to a Nokia but not the Blackberry via bluetooth). A good concept but not yet a keeper. Better to use a small notebook computer in my opinion.
1,First N770 stopped working,"Bought a 770 as a birthday gift and it stopped working after a few minutes. It fired up and I entered setup info (time,date,etc.), then it wouldn't/couldn't find my wireless internet, so no connection was ever established. Now the screen comes on, but nothing comes up on the screen except for 2 vertical lines. Returned to store and have bought another to replace it. When it comes in, I'll update this review ( provided that one works )."
1,It was a peace of junk but a good concept,I couldn't get it to connect to the cisco wirless net work at work I sent it back for a refund thats the only positive thing I can say I got my refund quick thanks amazon.
3,Nice gadget but has annoying limitations,"The 770 is easy to use and I was able to connect via bluetooth with my motorola phone easily. However, I did find that it does have web surfing limitations. It didn't work with several airline websites that I use and it also didn't work with several financial institution websites. Another issue for me was that you cannot stream video (news web sites for example) or music (sirius on-line). Because of these issues, I returned it because it couldn't perform the basic things I needed it to do. The new N800 seems to have resolved some of these issues and I will try that one instead."
4,slick,"slick , cool , fun , useful, works as claimed, not microsoft and that's a plus! easy to learn if you have half a brain, that's all i used the other half was watching tv. shop for best price. get free 770 software on line, most 800 will also work, get the free 770 video converter and buy lots of 2gig rs-mmc, great picture, record whole movies on 2gig with lots of space left over, change mem on fly as long as you are not accessing it!shop shop shop now that the 800 is out i have seen the 770 from 50 to 275 dollars!"
3,device is awesome,"The device itself is awesome, I grab bunch of applications from maemo and install it with no problem as far as you know how to work with Linux command line.So far I am 100% satisfied with the device and the price I paid for this thing.The only reason that I gave 3 stars are, there is problem with the display in this series I guess, as once i had this problem I google it and found that there were lot of peoples were facing the same thing. In my case what happened was one morning when I woke up and tried to turn the device on, I saw only bright screen, I heard the sound which tells me that machine is booting up. but can't see anything on the screen at all, just white bright screen. I was very lucky that it happened to me on my 22nd day of purchase, so I returned it.beside that this is amazing PDA on this price, if you really wanna spend less than $200.00 for PDA thats the device to go with.Nokia 770 Internet Tablet PC"
4,a work in progress,"I think that the Nokia 770 is a useful device, but with the lack of a integrated keyboard and the OS (that is a little bit slow to react) are strong cons..."
4,Great little device.,"I purchased Nokia 770 for about $130. It is well worth it. If you are a Linux user you will really enjoy it. You can do things such as VNC and ssh to other computers, stream music and browse hard drives on other pcs. One think that it does not do easily is watch youtube and google videos it is possible but not very convenient (using uktube). It does play real player format so you can watch some things. Over all for the price it is great little device."
5,Best Interview Book Around -- Fun,"This book contains a compilation of Dylan's own words, transcribed from interviews, press conferences, radio, and TV shows.Complete with scores of pictures, In His Own Words is a must for any Dylan fan.Dylan dons persona after persona, and the results are quite entertaining."
5,Excellent belt pack,"I've used this pack for 4 years, including 2 months of intensive hiking in Europe. I carry a Canon 20D, 70-200 zoom (using a larger side pack), 16-35 zoom, 28-70 zoom, and a 2x extender, plus lens hoods for each lens. The main compartment will easily hold the camera with the 28-70 lens attached, and with some squeezing will hold the camera + 70-200 lens. It is very handy for accessing your camera quickly. I use it mostly as a waist pack."
1,Like it? Read the original by Elizabeth Goudge,"This novel is a rather famously plagiarized version of Elizabeth Goudge's ""The Rosemary Tree"", and I'm surprised that this is not mentioned anywhere in the description of the book. The case was rather notorious and ended with the apparent suicide of this author once the truth had come out. At any rate, if you enjoyed this book, give credit to the original delightful novel by Elizabeth Goudge, and seek out her other works which are just as good."
3,Average rating,"I bought this product simply because someone else recommended it. It was alright but was not upto my expectations. Perhaps, it is because my expectations were too high!"
2,didn't like,"Didn't care for this shoe, I have already returned it. I am used to KEEN or Privo, this is a much cheaper version."
3,Working my way back to hue,"Kansas used to be what some call a blue state but as we see in the documentary WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH KANSAS?, inspired by the non-fiction book of the same name, it is today a so-called red state. Compelling in an understated way, the film feels like what might happen were you to travel through the Sunflower State and randomly meet several of its residents. What they all have in common is being in over their heads, with opportunity in Kansas and virtually everywhere else in America the worst since the Great Depression. As WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH KANSAS? depicts, too many Kansans rally behind the political forces that have destroyed the prosperity their parents and grandparents knew."
5,great grips,These are perfect beginner grips; not to stiff for the little hands. Not too bulky or thick for those gymnastics who do short routines and aren't doing giants on the upper bar.
3,Johnny U fan,I am a Johhny U fan since I was very young. I always try to get some items as they become available.
3,Trash cans,"Fast delivery. The cans are made of somewhat thinner metal than I expected, but they are good value for their size and for money we paid. Above all, squirrels will be unable to gnaw and perforate them as they did with our plastic ones."
1,Don't buy more than one!,"Purchased three of these cans for work. They came stacked inside each other (as expected) but we could absolutely not get them apart. It's like they were fused together or something. After many attempts to seperate we started trying some tools...rubber mallet, crowbar, etc. The metal is so thin that they now look pretty beat up. Still not apart, they're sitting in the corner of the warehouse looking like something that we salvaged from a hailstorm. Should have gotten something more heavy duty or at least purchased them individually or something. What a waste."
4,Good for pet food storage,"I've had racoons get into all the plastic food storage containers I stored my dog food in. This bad boy has held up nicely for the last year, totally waterproof and racoon proof with no signs of wear and tear yet. However, it can be found locally for about $10 less."
4,Trash Can with Lid,The trash can tends to dent easily. But since I use it outdoors for trash that's OK with me. I have it for a spare can when needed. The can serves it's purpose. Packaging of this item can definitely be improved on!
4,Good trash can,"i haven't used them yet.However,when I opened them,I realized that I have trash cans for at least 5 years compare to some cheap plastic one that brakes after a few weeks."
3,Not Bad for the Price,"I ordered this can, thinking I would use it to store dog food but realized immediately that it was just too large for that. The smaller version was definitely too small so I thought this size would work but it didn't. The can will be fine as a garbage can but it's not quite as sturdy as I thought it would be. The handle on the top wobbles. It doesn't feel really strong. Since I'm planning to use it as a back up can, in the event my other can gets filled before it's time to be collected, it will be fine. Would I buy another one? Probably not but it's okay so I'll hang on to it. After all, it's just a garbage can."
2,"REASONABLE BOOK, EMBARASSING CD","I JUST DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY... THIS CD DISPLAYS A COMPLETE LACK OF CONSIDERATION OR RESPECT BY THE PUBLISHER, PROGRAMMER, OR WHOMEVER IS RESPONSIBLE. THE ANSWERS WERE WRONG SO OFTEN THAT I BEGAN TO COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM. ON A POSITIVE NOTE, THE BOOK WAS WELL WRITTEN SO I WILL NOT HOLD GEOFF MARTZ PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE."
1,book is ok but. . .,The program is buggy. I was once given a math question during the verbal section and another time was given a high score even if I did poorly( I checked the result afterwards and scoring did not agree with the algorithm taught in book). It gave you false confidence as well.
1,Don't buy this book for the Software,"If you're considering buying this book for the Computer Adaptive tests on CD Rom then think again. On the cover it claims ""Four Complete Tests on CD-Rom"" and inside the book it details the elaborate interface. But once you install it you find - 1 Test, a stupid interface any person who learned C yesterday could write over lunch, and only the most rudimentry analysis of your scores......Oh and Kaplan is suing the Princeton Review over this book....."
5,Always be one Lena Horne,"Been almost a year since the great Lena Horne have left us eternally, today we still honor and celebrate her legacy all the time. She almost got the recognition she deserved. This album I first bought on vinyl sometime ago made me realize how I became a dear fan of hers since my introduction to her begin withAn Evening With Lena Horne: Live At The Supper Cluband later NATURE'S BABY. Makes so far my third album I been into her for a while and today its outstanding. I never saw the play yet but will one day, overall I give this entire 2 album set great props with no mess. Legendary been produced by the great and almighty Quincy Jones. Great sound from the orchestra backing her up and great arrangements."
4,"Good Product, Good Price",Top quality. For under $20 this is a great deal. This is not a plastic piece of junk. I use it for the chilled white wines we never seem to finish.
4,Flush free Niacin,I take niacin on my doctor's recommendation for my cholesterol (along with flax seed oil). The ordinary type of niacin causes you to develop a flush on your face and feel warm. The flush-free type gives you same advantage of the niacin without the side effects.
2,Great...if I had actually gotten it,"This is a great product, have used it for years and this brand has actually been tested to ensure you get what it says you do. Unfortunately, Amazon sent me the wrong product - TWICE, and then tried to charge me this shipping to return it so each return took 2 phone calls since you have to get special permission to return a vitamin type of thing..."
4,Okay for baby who has a lot of head support,"My 5 month old still falls over forward in this. Not sure how a baby any younger than him could sit in it. I wish I had the one with the tray on it though, because he can't reach any toys that are on the ground in front of him, so the chair defeats the purpose. I think I'd be much happier if I had the one with the tray."
5,Great chair,"We love this chair..... we feed our son in it and he sits in it at times when we play. It fits him really well. We started at 4 months in it, and he needed a little help from falling over, but now he does great. DO NOT LEAVE A BABY UNATTENDED IN IT... they will eventually squirm their way into falling out. Love the color, love that it is light weigth. We throw it in the van and take it to Grandmas for play and feeding too."
3,I wouldn't buy it NEW...,"This seat is helpful for baby to sit up and play before they can sit independently, but I think it's way over-priced for its function, so wouldn't buy it new. Glad we got it second-hand. I think looking back we would've preferred bumbo brand since it has a toy-tray option while this one makes it hard to display any toys for baby - except for on the floor where it's hard for her to reach. Or we would sometimes put it right up to the fabric bars on her activity gym play mat so she could always reach the dangly toys there while seated. It makes a good seat for propping baby up for snapshots and photos, and even a portable eating chair if you're going over to someone's house for dinner - BUT only should be used on the floor where it is safe - never on a chair or table."
3,Strong Chemical Smell,"I found this product to have a very strong chemical smell. I couldn't stand the smell and couldn't image having a new baby around it, so I returned it. It reminded me of a foam workout mat I once owned that had this strong chemical smell for all the years I owned it (and hardly ever used because of of it).I purchased the Bumbo seat and it has almost no smell. And they even sell a tray attachment for it now. I am pleased with it."
3,Be warned...,"I have checked the details of this edition on the publishers web site, and it only appears to be 34.0 x 26.0 cm.This is NOT the gorgeous 58% full size original edition, which was nearly twice that size. I don't know how good this edition will be, but it is not the book I know. That said, I expect the text and pictures to be the same, if smaller, and they were both very good in Wilson's original book."
4,Teechino,The product is good and the shipping was in a timely manner. Thanks Amazon for the great service!
2,A disappointing album,"I remember when this album first came out. I'd enjoyed Spring Session M and (particularly) Rhyme & Reason, so I immediately bought Color in Your Life when it arrived at my local record store. Unfortunately, the band took a turn toward standard dance music with this album. While Dale's voice was as nice as ever, that didn't keep them from sounding like every other pop/dance band out at the time.The album does have a few redeeming qualities. The title track is actually pretty good, as is ""No Secrets."" The rest of the tracks vary from mediocre to embarassing.Pass this one up."
4,does what it says to protect your gear,"I bought this as a second insert to go inside my F-2 bag.The padding is nice and thick and the velcro mates up with the velcro inside of the bag.Only slight negative is that the foam inserts in the sides are not sealed on the bottom. I am not sure if this is to allow a couple of them to be removed (if you only want front and back protection) or what, but it seemed a little unfinished for the price.The Canon 5D Mark III with an attached 50mm lens fits nicely in the pocket with the ability to be easily removed."
1,Sent it back,"I own a number of Domke products. This product was garbage and mislabeled.First, the foam is not sewn into the walls of the compartment. It arrived with foam missing and some folded into itself and there is no padding on the bottom of the compartment. Next, the product was actually 3"" larger than specified making it impossible for me to use. On this aspect, it is possible the item was labeled incorrectly. Finally, it was missing dividers.I find it hard to believe this is a Domke product. The quality is simply not consistent with my past experience."
2,Does the job but poorly made,"I was surprised at the poor sewing on the bottom of the insert. Basically you have the foam padding sewed directly to the cover, sort of sandwich style. There is no material folded over to protect the edge: the foam is exposed, roughly cut and little pieces are falling off. The sides are constructed better: basically pockets with foam inside and neatly covered edges. As an insert it works well and my EOS 7D and 15-85 USM fit fine. Just not the class act I expected from Domke. For a few more bucks I could have gotten a Billingham insert. Now those are made with tender loving care."
5,Now I've read them all!,"I've read Driftwood and Indigo Blue both by Cathy Cassidy, and when I saw this new book in the store- I had to get my hands on it!Cathy Cassidy introduces us to Dizzy who lives a careful and cautious life with her stern dad. But she has a secret. Every night on her birthday her mother sends her letter from a different place in the world. Her mother is a wondering hippie, who left Dizzy when she was just 4 to live as a hippy and travel the world. But this birthday, Dizzy isn't sent a letter, she is sent a delivery. A delivery that appears right at her doorstep.Dizzy is an amazing, well-written book. I loved it."
3,Fair,"I am an adult who enjoys reading teen books. There are lots and lots of good teen books out there.Dizzy is not bad. It is basically the story of a 12 year old who gets to spend some time with her wayward mother and share some experiences with her.While the first half of the book was pretty good, the second hald kind of drags - especially when we get into the too many details of Storm's life.I don't especially like the Storm character very much and felt extremely sorry for Dizzy who can't ever seem to reconcile herself fully with the mother she was dealt.This is a fair book."
3,Dizzy,"This was a really cute book. It was very predictable, but it was still really good. It didn't take me very long to read it, as it's a pretty short book, but I enjoyed every minute of it. The character relationships are interesting and the whole book was just fun."
4,Love Binds Families Together Through All Obstacles Faced,"Grandmother has become a recluse who having lived during the depression never throws away anything that can be used and goes through dumpsters. A path is all that goes through her house and she allows noone inside. Her daughter and granddaughter come to spend the summer to get things in order even though Granny doesn't want them. As they go through the clutter, they each realize that they are in need of doing some house cleaning in their own lives. Love never fails as the past meets the future in this heartwarming story."
1,Great,I had read the book before and wanted it for my sister-in-law who does quilting. It is brand new and I got it for a great price. Thank you.
2,Wedding Ring,The product arrived with considerable damage that was not included in the description from the advertiser
4,Better than expected,"I have very sensitive skin that makes it very difficult for me to use an electric shaver regularly. I cannot shave every day even if I use a good blade and take a nice shower. That being said, I use this electric shaver occasionally (like while I am on a trip and such). Although it is battery operated, I found the shaver powerful enough. It does irritate my skin a bit, but not more than I expected. And the shave is not as smooth as you would get using a good blade, but very close. It is far better than the other Philips I used long time ago. What I did not like is the charger base. I am sorry to say this Philips guys, but that thing is a joke."
2,Poor shave for the price,"While the ability to clean the razor under running water is a nice feature, it hardly makes up for the poor shaving performance of this product. I have owned multiple, more basic Norelco eletric razors which all gave better shaves than the 9160XL Smart Touch. Do yourself a favor - if you're going to buy a Norelco razor, purchase a less expensive model and use a brush to clean out the whiskers."
5,Philips Norelco 9160XL,l have owned norelco shavers for over 30 years. the one l had finally gave out. l saw this 9160 and l bought it. it is everything the article says it is. l am very pleased with it. it deserves another star l think.if you purchase this l am sure you will be pleased with it as l am.
3,Norelco 9160 XL,"Positives - very quiet motor, long lasting battery,Negative - does not shave well in the area between chin and neck (below the jaw). Battery charger is bigger than most models - so little inconvenient to carry during travel."
4,Very good shaver,Very good shaver overall. The rechargeable battery has excellent life - average over 10 days per charge. The selling feature is more cutting area for the 3 rotary blades - but the extra cutting surface doesn't seem to speed shaving.
2,disappointing - compared to the last model,"I have to agree with the other comment before mine...I used Norelco 9885XL before. After five years, I decided to upgrade it. I am so disappointed with this later model. It does a poor job trimming the hair around the neck. I tried to slow down while trimming and hoping that it will trim the hair cleanly, it is indeed a futile effort. I wish I had my old Norelco but I already threw it away. I am switching to Braun after this one."
4,Shaved a few numbers from the overall rating,"I purchased this razor to replace a Norelco Cool Skin Series shaver. I like the features and enhancements and can say that it is on par with my previous shaver, but with that said.....Why even buy a new one. I like the shaver and it has a more modern appearance than the older, but the shave is roughly the same. No pun intended.It is fairly comfortable but some of the features seem gimmicky and for all of the advances that the razor claims to have seem to fall short of the glory.I can knock the razor completely. It does a decent job, has a quieter smooth operation, and holds a better charge than the previous razor. I will not be dismissing the Cool Skin from the lineup, but I certainly would have loved to have felt like that was completely necessary."
4,Surprisingly satisfied,"I got my husband this razor for his birthday in early April, 2007. He'd been complaining that he was having trouble getting a clean shave with his manual razor in hard to reach places. He's been using the razor for over a month now and is very happy with it. While it takes him a bit longer to shave (he has to go over areas a number of times), it gets those hard to reach places far better than his manual razor did. He was very surprised and pleased about that. He said this morning that he'll never go back to the manual."
5,Great Razor,"Norelco really does make a great shaver,anyother I have used needs blades replaced every 50-60 days I've got a bad face to shave every morning and would highly suggest anyone should gave the smart razor a try. I would give it more than five stars I would give it 10 if there were that many. So any males should really consider this and Happy shaveing the smart way. Thanks Norelco good job."
5,Great Shaver,"I bought this for a gift for my son, but he tells me all the time how much he likes it. It replaced a Norelco he had and he says it is alot better."
2,Expected better,"I am more of a ""blade razor"" sort of person, so few electric shavers have stood up to my expectations. My last one, a wet/dry Panasonic was very nice, but still had trouble in the neck areas. The Norelco 9160 does much better in ""trouble"" areas, however - it just doesn't shave that close. By midday I need to go over my face once more and by 5PM, I look like I haven't shaved in a day or two.This product is not all bad. It is very quiet, which is nice. And it did not irritate my skin whatsoever, even the first week (like many other electric shavers). Lastly, being able to just rinse out the shaver with warm water makes cleaning a breeze; I actually LOVE that feature! So I wish this one would have worked out, but I think I may return it under Norelco's ""money-back guarantee."""
4,Worked better now.,"I bought this item at Jr electronics and it is new, after I saw good reviews at consumers reports.It was my first shaver, it's been 3 weeks now and it works better now, wait, give it some time for your face to adjust to the change. When I first used it it didn;t work as expected but once your face adjust, it works better."
5,Shaved in Seattle,"I had the same Philips shaver for over 10 years before upgrading to this model. It really does shave closer and the pivoting heads allow for better contact under the jaw and chin area. I really enjoy the ability to clean it with hot water as well. After one month of use, I would recommend this product."
4,very nice product,It is a great razor. I had to get use to it shaving so close. It slightly irritaed my skin a little. I love it and it holds a charge for a while. Worth the money. Norelco makes a great razor.
3,Phillips Norelco 9160 XL shaver,"I have used a tripple head shaver for years. If the extra life battery charging, or the use of 220V or 120V electricity, and being able to wash it in the sink, are important it may be worth the extra expense. I was hopeing the shave would be better than my old shaver but its not, in my case. If I were makeing this purchase now, I would stay with the $50.00 shaver."
5,Norelco 9160XL men's shaver,"The model number is important, as others of this series have cumbersome sounding ""extras"" - very costly - which I doubt add anything (a cleaning device and a gel to shave with).Having used rotary Norelcos for nearly 50 years, I have found some ""upgrades"" to new models to be of limited value; but the 9160XL is a clearcut improvement from my 5+ year old one. It shaves more closely, is not irritating to skin (as they warn) and is very easy to keep clean by frequent washing in tap water.It is also much quieter and very light weight, yet does not appear to be flimsy. Time will tell, but I am optimistic."
4,A Toy.........Not!,"This is indeed part of a new generation of electric shavers. Previous shavers were relatively heavy and noisy. That's why I was shocked to discover the lightness, quietness and smoothness of this shaver. The RPMs seemed slower than my previous Norelco classic. And it was so quiet,in fact, that I thought this must be a toy (at an adult price) for a 6-year old boy to use while pretending to shave. Surely Norelco cannot be serious! The plastic for the unit is quite light. But that doesn't compare to the lightness of the charging stand. Fitting the shaver into the stand can be a tricky maneuver. I already dropped it once. But after using the shaver I must admit it did give me a close shave. And that's the bottom line! However, I would prefer Norelco include a heavier, better fitting stand in which to store the razor, not necessarily with a charging plug. You can always charge it directly with the electric cord. If Norelco would design a better stand I would rate it a Five."
3,Great shave; easy on the skin,"I bought the Norelco 9160XL SmartTouch for my husband as a gift. For weeks, he has raved about the Norelco and the great shave. He had his old shaver ""for ages"". He can't imagine why he didn't get the Norelco sooner. It is so much easier on his skin.I gave this product five stars (not 3 stars as is noted above)"
4,One of the best.,"This has been an excellent shaver since I've had it. It's well made, and I have hopes it will last as well as the last NORELCO I had. Holds a charge well."
4,not as good as I expected,"My old Norelco severed me for almost 10 years and stopped working latterly since batteries are absolutely died. I decided to buy this one since it is a top model in new Norelco series and got 1) so called `SmartTouch' Reflex Action System 2) rinse clean.Now I have used it for over a month and feel a little disappointed. The biggest problem is the hair chamber isn't very well sealed so while shaving the chopped hair will fly over on my hand, on floor. If don't clean out the hair after use it can become very irritating on next shave (even rinse after each use still cannot totally keep it from happening). Another thing is that SmartTouch, I have to say I cannot tell anything good about it except a feeling of fragileness.Overall: it is a decent shaver and does its job. You HAVE TO rinse it clean EVERY TIME."
3,norelco quality can be had in a cheaper razor,"I've been using Norelco rotary razors for years, I can't really see/feel a difference in the upgraded blades for this model but it does follow the contours of my face better than my older Norelco's allowing for reduced shavings time. This model tends to collect hair/dirt more easily than other models and needs to be cleaned more often. The faucet light that reminds you to clean the razor is unnecessary.The plastic cover that fits over the blades broke within a week."
4,"So far, so good. No major compaints.","I have shaved with it four times so far. Each time takes a little less time. The first time it took me about 20 minutes because I have to break in my beard and skin. I have to learn the right technique to use it properly and quickly. The manufacturer states that it takes daily shaves for about 3 weeks before you can work up to a very good, quick shave. On the closest of 3 settings, the shave is remarkably close. It feels like it is as close as a conventional safety razor shave.It has taken a little more time than I expected to clean and dry it after each use, probably because I am a new owner of the product. The last cleaning took about 5 minutes, which was not as long as the first time. It is very easy to clean because the moving parts can be rinsed and cleaned in running water. I like that. It feels very comfortable when I hold it.I cannot say yet whether I would buy the product again, but I have no significant compaints so far."
5,now I am believer of electric shavers,"smooth, ergonomically-friendly, low noise...i've been using all my life the conventional razor, but now I regret for not adapting Norelco since the old days"
4,norelco shaver,"The Phillips Norelco 9160XL electric shaver gives a nice close comfortable shave. Another feature is that the shaver indicates how much charge is left before it needs recharging,it is also easy to clean."
2,More Cheaply Made,"I just received the 9160XL today to replace my previous model #7864XL, and am a bit underwhelmed. It feels cheaper to hold than my previous Norelco model, and upon close inspection of the screens and cutting wheels, my old ""1-track"" 7-series were of a much higher quality and had a much greater degree of precision with regard to holes & slits than this new 3-track (Speed-XL) model. Comparing them up close, it's really disappointing. Also, the charging base has a cheap feel and should be weighted. I would have expected much better quality for $140."
2,Only does 1/2 the job,"I am not all that pleased with the 9160 in that I always have to double-back over the entire neck to get all the whiskers it left behind. Makes one wonder ""what's the point?"". I am pleased with the smoothness of the shave above my chin line. The battery charge last over a week and it is a snap to clean. But my opinion is highly weighed against all of the whiskers that are left behind and therefore consider this a waste of my money. My current search is for a better designed shaver to replace it. Anyone want a free Norelco 9160XL?"
1,caveat emptor,"This machine is all right if you like to shave three times a day. Otherwise, stick with your blade.The famous pivoting heads do not actually pivot much, so upper neck, jaw and chin are a real challenge to trim. And two hours later, you feel like you need a shave.Also, the elaborate cleaning/oiling recommended by the User's Manual will have you longing for the simplicity of your razor.Further, the cost of replacing heads is a hidden cost. Also, the need to purchase the oil and cleaning supplies. They do not come with the machine.Finally, the User's Manual (even though labeled 9160 XL) does not square with the machine supplied.Bottom line: If you're thinking of switching from razors to electric shavers, think again."
3,electric razors,"as far as electrics go I guess it is simple to use ,Holds a great charge but my neck never gets shaved always going back and forth until you wind up with a good rash ."
4,Shaves well,"I got my husband one of these for Christmas as he desperately needed a new razor. He picked it out, I paid for it and he says it works great. He can shave more often now and gets a very smooth shave and afterwards we spend time striking poses similar to those in the men's shaving commericals on TV where sexy, baby-faced male gets his face rubbed by sexy-I-love-smooth-faces female. Only we don't get paid for it."
5,"I've had them all, this is the best one yet","Over the years I've had Braun, Panasonic and Norelco. Braun has the great cleaning system, but the foil irritates my face. The Panasonic was terrible. Didn't shave well at all. I've liked norelcos over the year for comfort, but they it can take a while, with many passes to get a good shave, especially in the neck..This unit, by far the best electric I've ever used. One pass for most parts of my face, a couple on the neck. It quiet, you hardly think it's working then you feel your face.. great stuff. Highly recommended."
4,Very good razor for sensitive skin,"Very good shave. I have very sensitive skin and apperciate the SmartTouch feature. Faithful Norelco user for many years, but find new requirement to clean after each use somewhat irritating, expecially during morning rush. However, would recommend this product for its other fine features."
5,Quiet and great,"The one issue you'll find with this razor is that it's so quiet, you'll think it's not doing anything. Having gotten used to a Braun for a few years, I guess I had forgotten just how loud other razors are, compared to Norelco's. The Norelco is super quiet. And like my Norelco from years ago, the battery lasts forever. I also like the fact that you can use water to clean it out - instead of having to spend about $10 per month to clean the Braun. I don't know how long it will really last yet, but I must say, I'm back as a Norelco customer - for a long time!!!!"
5,Norelco 9160XL,This is the best razor i have ever bought for a man.It doesn't pull hair and shaves real close.Washing it out is a plus. Every man should have one.+++++++++
4,a bit quirky to use and maintain,"While this shaver works very well out of the box, the instructions are not clear, and the help on the phone just reads the unclear instructions back to you. On the one hand the instructions say to use the plastic cap to protect the head, but they also say wash after each use and leave the head widely sprung open to dry. This takes a lot of storage space, so be forewarned, and you can't put the cap on while it's drying. There's also a crypic comment that one should oil the heads occasionally by putting the oil in the center hole. But there are many ""center holes on the inside and outside, so it isn't clear where to oil. And neither the phone nor email helpers knew anything about oiling.But otherwise, it is quiet and shaves as good as my old Norelco 985."
1,Cheaply made and breaks....,"The rotors in the shaver that turn the blades in the head are made of some sort of plastic. They are pencil shaped and have a tiny plactic triangular piece at the tip of the rotor. These tips break off and Phillips has no way of repairing them or sending a replacement piece. I ended up returning my razor to Phillips in an effort to get my money back. Too, bad, great heads and used to make great razors too. Please avoid my problem. Jay"
1,"Shaves Great, Breaks Often","When I first tried the shaver I was beyond pleased. What a great shave! It was very quiet. After a month the motor started bogging down. Even with ongoing careful cleaning and proper charging of the batteries, the shaver eventually refused to run. Customer service was obsessed with charging. Did you charge it for more than four hours? Then plug it in again and charge it for only four hours. That made sense to them. I sent it back and Norelco sent me a new one. The new one lasted as long. It is now beginning to slow and bog down. I just ordered a Panasonic. I cannot get up one morning to find this shaver refusing to shave. I should not have to have a spare to fill in between service calls."
4,Smart Buy,"First thing I noticed was how quiet it is. Fully charged it sounded like my old Braun just before the charge ran out. Also I was very satisfied with the close shave that I got. The only concern that I found was that, if you try to shave a two day beard there might be some pulling instead of cutting. Not pleasant but does not happen frequently. Overall very pleased."
2,Good Stuff.,I've had this razor for over a year now and I love it. I used to shave with it before I got into the shower but now I shave with it IN the shower. I feel I get a much better shave when it's wet. The blades are still good on it but I feel i'll probably need to get them replaced within the next few months. It is very quiet and it runs very good.I didn't get a stand with mine so i'm not sure what's up with that. I however did not purchase this through Amazon.*****01/05/2010It has now stopped charging correctly. Sometimes it will charge. Most of the time it wont.
4,Pretty good,"I have been using this for about a month now. It takes a LOT longer to shave than one that moves a bit faster - my last one was awesome but exploded in a car crash :). Shaves easy, no burning afterwards, charge has lasted me over 3 weeks, can clean with water only. Only thing I do not like about it is having to go over the same area again and again and again - which is why the charge lasts for so long - moves VERY SLOWLY, I thought it was broken the first time I turned it on. Honestly, I would probably buy another one instead that shaves faster, but I will stick with it as it works :)"
2,Major Disappointment,"I've been using Norelcos for years and they always gave a great shave UNTIL this model. The speed of the shaver is audibly slower than all previous models. This makes for a far more uncomfortable shave, pulling in places. I still have my previous model (8825) which gives a FAR more superior shave to this 9160XL. My blanket trust of Norelco is no longer there and I am suspicious of new models based on my great disappointment with this one. When I called Norelco to complain, the woman on the other end didn't seem too concerned and said I was stuck with it. It was a Christmas gift that I didn't start using until after the 30 day period had passed. 2 stars is the most I can give and even that's a stretch."
4,"good pruduct, just what I expected","I've always had norelco shavers. I changed my old one becouse of battery problems, so thisone, the 9160xl, was just what I expected.Has a great battery, easy to clean, shaves well, etc."
3,Norelco 9160XL Smart Touch Men's Shaver,"Shaver's good points.Extended battery power between recharging. Good close shaves.Shaver's bad points.Once the red light comes on indicating that a recharge is required the shaver quits and will not turn back on until it is charged. There is no reserve power it just stops. The Plastic clip covering the shaver head is extremely low quality, the original and replacement norelco sent both broke within a couple of days."
4,Overall it is pretty good,It takes a little while to train you beard to use this electric razor. Once that is done it does a pretty good job and I really like being able to wash it out with water and not needing to use a brush or cleaning solution.
1,Want a rash?,"Don't buy this unless you want a rash? At first it was ok but as the 3rd-4th week I developed a rash,it seemed convenient but when you consider the outcome it's not worth it.Going back to the triple bladed hand razor,now!"
2,"Norelco Shaver,feh!!!","Cheap looking and cheaply made, does not deliver the close shaves advertised.It has an awkward and unstable stand and not two parts fit perfectly, besides its ugly design. I wish I had my old Norelco back."
3,Not the best,I don't think it shaved any better than the Braun Shaver. Unfortunately Norelco came out with the newer model just after I had purchaed the 9160XL
4,Better than the Braun 360,"Quiet, nearly noiseless. You can actually hear it when its shaving. Fast too.Easy to clean. Get this one, the 5 LEDs model 9160xl is the best value for the buck. The yearly head replacement indicator is nice too. I could not tell a difference between this and the Braun 360 closeness wise. The Braun is so loud, you can't tell -hear- if you're actually cutting barely visible whiskers or not. I'm giving this four stars instead of five, only because I'd SWEAR I got a closer shave with the Norelco 7140 from Walmart which use the HQ8 heads."
4,Good shaver. Awkward stand.,The shaver is good. It is awkward to plug the shaver into the stand.The stand has a useless clock in its base. An automatic timer that would shut the charger off after the recommended one hour charge would be aworthwhile substitute for the clock.
5,From the back cover -,"""Thousands of Buddhist monks renounced their vows of nonviolence, and -- in the name of freedom -- charged into enemy lines. As the rest of the world watched with only the barest of interst, the United States began secretly training and arming groups of young Tibetan feeedom fighters, hoping to increase Tibet's chances of thwarting communist China.""Through interviews with the surviving warriors, religious and political leaders from Tibet and India, and the Dalai Lama -- whose dramatic escape from Tibet was facilitated by armed monks -- Dunham crafts a luminous narrative that cuts through the glamorized Western view of Tibet and the sanitized Chinese version of its occupation to reveal the extraordinary true story of the brave men and women who fought for the country -- and their culture."""
1,Difficult to Read,I'm sorry to say that I couldn't read much of this book because of frequent grammatical and sentence-structure problems. I got tired of parsing sentences to determine what the author really meant. I'm sorry to see such bad editing by a major publisher and hope that someone will publish again on this important topic in the near future.
5,The Human Cost of Cultural Genocide,"This is a book that brings the savagery and dehumanization of a people up very close and personal. It is told through the recounting of interviews that chillingly verify its authenticity through footnotes and specific information. Mikel Dunham interviewed Tibetan warriors, and American advisors to arrive at the truth behind the devastation to the Tibetan culture that was effected by the brutal Chinese invasion of 1959. The little known involvement of the USA and its attempts to train the Tibetan Guerrillas in subversive warfare should be known to the world. The forgotten people of Tibet who died in the thousands defending their country deserve more than oblivion. This book is an admirable attempt to right that enormous wrong. It is also a tale of the gross ineptness and laissez faire neglect of a potential strategic ally that was dismissed out of ignorance, arrogance and self serving politics. The book is a monument to the lost people of Tibet."
5,What a pity this book isn't still in print!,"This lovely novelization of a play by the same authors introduced me to the intriguing character of Elizabeth the First, and remains my favorite novel to deal with Elizabeth's early life. It spans the years from the death of Elizabeth's father to that of her sister, Mary, and Elizabeth's ascension to the throne. In it there are no heaving bosoms, no gratuitous sex scenes (and I say this as someone who likes a good non-gratuitous sex scene as well as anyone), and no wild conjecture without historical basis. Elizabeth's story is a good one without embellishment. This book tells it."
2,Not for beginners,"I was not happy with this product. I have been trying to learn QB and based on the reviews it looked like something for a beginner. But it is blurry and speeds you through the process. It does not explain WHY you can or cannot do things. It is all over the place, seemingly without any order. There is no way to slow it down unless you keep pausing and going back in which case it still speeds you through the screens. The voice is very mono tone. They use abbreviations that are hard to follow and do not remind you of what they are. I would not reccomend this to anyone who is a beginner. Make sure you have a general understanding of the program. This is more of an intermediate review program, it is not easy and NOT interactive except that every once in a while you get to click the NEXT button."
4,A Wonderfully Eclectic Selection,"One warning: this should be called ""Victor Records' Greatest Jazz Hits of the Late 1920s."" (It's fairly selective.) Given that, it's a wonderful sampler--2 classic Fats Waller piano tracks, Coleman Hawkins' great 1929 version of ""One Hour,"" some very young Benny Goodman. What you hear on this CD is the solo-oriented jazz that fell between Dixieland and swing. No record company--or single CD, for that matter--captures that perfectly, but this one does a pretty good job for the money."
4,Great price and quality,I ordered this for a 1920s themed party and it was excellent background music that helped to set the scene.
5,BRIGHT AND VIBRANT COLORS,"Flag was received as described. Excellent value for the price, saw the same flag in our local store for double the price."
3,Okay quality,"Nice flag for the price. Only paid about $5 for it, it was on sale. Would have been a little disappointed if I would have paid more. The flag looks nice and will be okay since I will only have it outside for a short time every year. But the quality doesn't seem as good as some of the other flags I ordered at the same time as this one. Overall though, fairly satisfied with my purchase."
1,high pressure regulator w/ 90 degree fitting,"The product sent me was completly wrong for the stated applacation desired, and the company declined to solve the problem,so I am stuck with a completly usless product."
2,"Bought 2 of these, the plastic top panel is weak",Both have panel/electrical panel issues. Its the weakest link. Better to get an all metal casing.
1,"Great story, bad DVD","Though this is a good story about a very conservative little country village outside of the big city, the DVD itself is worthless. I purchased a version by Vina Distributor because of its low price. Every now and then the images get scrambled. I get the feeling that the ""master"" is a used DVD that transferred its defects to all its distributing copies. I say this because I asked for a replacement. I got another DVD with the same defects! I recommend paying the extra price for a better quality DVD from a different studio. As for the movie, Fernando Soler and Lilia Prado put on a great show, supported by María Elena Marquez. Emilio Fernández does a cameo. Columba Domínguez could have given a better performance had her character been enhanced. I give this product a 1-star because of the bad DVD quality. The story itself is worth 4-stars."
1,The price is absurd,"I would love to acquire and read this book, but the price is absurdly high. I wonder what Mumford would have thought about a price of $119 for a discussion of his body of thought."
3,Just OK,"The smell is not that bad at all. I havnt seen any big improvements on my skin with this, just little ones. It did start to overdry my face. I did notice that after use i could tell it was trying to clean out my pores. I can say that it did break me out in spots. Will i buy this again?-NO probably not. Not worth the money. Good for use once a week so i will use up the rest of the jar then i will find another product."
2,Not Very Effective,This product is not a very effective overnight drying spot treatment for acne. I have used other products with sulfur that worked better. It works well to shrink the appearance of large pores.
5,A must-have item !,"A live concert with the best violinist of our time! Superbly recorded. Those who are going to buy this should buy the video too! The video not only includes the interview with the violinist, but also a marvellous off-the-show performance by Gil Shaham. Shaham may not be that outstanding in this concert but you'll see this is not true if you have watched the video, too.Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman's duet on ""Passacaglia and Sarabande with variations on a theme by Handel for violin and viola"" is excellent !! It exhibits almost all skillsets that could be do with a string instrument and how good they have been handled!! This recording is indescribably good !"
3,"Works fine, but limited software","The camera works ok and image is reasonable quality. It has one significant drawback: only one user can view it a time. This may be ok if you know you are only going to view from one location, but otherwise this is a pain. If you accidentally leave it logged in somewhere and try to view it from another machine, you're stuck.The viewing software is a Windows ActiveX control, so there is no way to view the camera from other operating systems."
3,I Expected More,"Compared to the other netcams out there that have built-in PAN and TILT functions, the price makes it a great deal. I wanted to use it to create a time-lapsed movie of my backyard going from a dirt lot to a personal oasis 8-). I was disappointed that the provided software only gave me basic functions (record, snapshot, pan, tilt, zoom). I WISH it had capabilities like- scheduled monitoring (ex. record from 8am to 5pm),- software-based motion detection (currently requires an optional sensor),- 'take a snapshot every X seconds' feature.Also, it sucks that only one user can access the camera at a time. Has anyone figured out a way to stream the video (or snapshots) over the Internet (so a bunch of people can view the webcam)?Currently, the only third-party software application I could find that supports the Veo Observer is Netcam Watcher Professional by Beau Software (www.beausoft.com)."
5,Great carpet cleaner,I use this detergent with a Hoover SteamVac on my carpets only. I use it mostly for general cleaning of my carpets a couple times a year and have not used this product on deep stains. I used the detergent on my upholstery and it did not stain it at all. There is also little smell in the carpet from the cleaner. Sometimes I will only use hot water in my cleaner with no detergent between my twice a year cleanings.Another note: You do not have to use as much as they instruct on the bottle either. The same cleaning power can be obtained from using less. It is probably a scheme to get you to buy more detergent. I only wish amazon sold a larger bottle of this.
4,works ok,we tried many detergents and they all worked fine. I think they are all a little over priced. I would recommend this product.
4,great,it has a good smell and seems to do a great job for the price you cant go wrong but understand it is not a miricale worker
5,Great stuff,Great carpet cleaner. Works great at getting out stains and dirt. But recommend buyers get the 128 oz. container for better value.
4,rug cleaning detergent,This item shipped very quickly. The product performed as advertised and even removed rug stains that were there when I moved in 3 years ago. I will definitely buy this product again.
3,"good, but too much obscure tracks (=filler)","they should tell me why they didn't include ""Crapa pelada"" (this is a 2 cd set, guys, you could!!), replacing it with more low-key songs. But these guys are just great, and the whole record is enjoyable as hell."
3,oversized checklist,"Oops, perhaps I missed the dimensions statement? I expected a lifelist I could pack for an outing, I received a large, cumbersome book! Other than that, it works -- plenty of room to describe sightings and interactions with every bird in the US!"
5,Great product,Worked great with my phone and has protected it very well. Love the removable belt clip. Thanks
3,"OK, but poor buckle design/quality","Got this belt for use on the trail & thought it better to have my equipment around my waist rather than hanging off my shoulder. I've used it a few times, and it works well - no sore shoulders, but legs hurt after long hikes from the added weight at your hips. The belt is thick/wide enough to hold what I need with the additional cases/bags that fit this system/belt (a gripped dSLR body w/24-70 lens & 70-200 lens).The reason for 3 stars is that the front buckle is made of plastic - it should be metal! Camera bodies & lenses can be heavy & are not cheap! Shortly after putting on this belt & walking around the plastic buckle/clip came undone! I cannot afford to drop my equipment on the trail because of a cheap/plastic buckle that can unfasten so easily. I use this belt, but always use a spare piece of nylon, rope, etc. to secure it to my waist just in case the plastic clip comes unfastened..."
3,"I thought all kids are ""gifted""","In my view, every child is a ""Gift"" from god, and hence is gifted. I dont need a book to tell me that. I suspect parents these days are confusing giftedness with genius.. hence the clamor to label their kids as gifted. The good news in all this is atleast parents are paying attention to their kids more now than they used to. But please dont subject your kids to endless tests (like one reviewer below) just so someone labels your kids as gifted. These tests only measure genius ability (IQ), and not giftedness. Your kids may become outstanding athletes (very few athletes ever have IQ over the normal range). They may be gifted in athletics.. or become outstanding musicians - gifted in music. Or famed actors (gifted in the arts). Even Einstein wasn't gifted in the normal sense of the word.. he didnt speak till he was 4. But was he a genius? Absolutely."
2,Not what I thought,"I had wanted a book that better distinguished between cases/behaviors of children to better explain misdiagnoses. However, this book takes a longer approach to different children. Detailed in ways that are different than what I wanted."
2,Disappointing,"I had hoped to find new information on gifted individuals and specific disorders of information processing - Asperger's Syndrome in particular. The informatitn on AS was not useful,not new and clearly not directed to an audience of clincians. In fact, I disagree with some of what was said about AS,leading me to assume the author has limited experience with this populaiton. It is not a book I will be likely to use."
5,Pretty good book,"Didn't really have much of the information I was looking for, a lot of it is common knowledge. But a pretty good book for those who don't know that much about mental health disorders. Good advice for those with ADHD. I don't believe in psycho-pharmaceutical medications and I liked the books stance on that."
3,Good move but hard to follow.,This was a good move but it was hard to follow. We had to keep stopping it to read the subtiltes. It was Englsh when the tourist talked but when the people in Spain talked it was Spanish. I think it would have been a really great movie if it all had been in English and built up the supense more.
2,The Spanish Outback looks hella boring and so did this movie.,"The cooking shows Made in Spain and the Gwyneth Paltrow one haven't disabused me of this opinion. Everything looks very desert-y so who would travel to the boonies because the wine is so cheap. Stay on the coasts. Spaniards look like really nice people (not in this movie, of course) but really, who would go into the sandy outback who wasn't born there and stuck there a la Don Quixote. I didn't realize that this was set in the 70s."
3,did not finish watching,"i got bored, but i have not finished watching so who know it might turn out good"
2,"Gary, Gary, what were you thinking?","I admit, I rented this because I saw Gary Oldman's picture on the disc cover, but what a disappointment. What were you thinking, Gary? His acting, as always, was wonderful, however, the storyline/script was horrid and a waste of his ability and time. I was greatly disappointed, and was only able to give it more than one star because of Gary's performance."
3,Probability Textbook,"The textbook was new quality, however it did not arrive the first time it was shipped, nor did it return to the sender. After about two weeks the sender shipped a second book. The second shipping took longer than the 6-7 business days that was promised and I needed the book for a class. So although the quality of the book was very good, the delivery was less than pleasing."
5,An Excellent Book!,"This is a much needed book that bridges theory and numerical computations. Theory needs to be supplemented with numerical applications to get a well-grounded understanding, especially in Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes."
4,"Great bag, very durable.","I have been a professional photographer for almost 10 years and this bag works from the newsroom to the wedding ceremony. The bag is great, lots of room to store gear. It feels extremely sturdy. Pocket space is huge, but there aren't any small compartments to store things like filters, batteries, cables, etc. There are pockets, but not small closeable pockets. Bag can easily hold a Nikon D200 (w/grip), 3-4 lenses and 1-2 flashes. There is a lot of space in this bag, but it doesn't sit right to keep a lens on your camera body unless it's short (24mm fixed).I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone from a professional journalist down to a hobbyist. It sits well on your shoulder, is durable, holds a lot of gear, and doesn't make you feel like you're wearing a giant painful weight."
5,Great Bag!,"I purchased this bag after reading a lot of reviews and I am very happy with it. After a week of use I did replace the metal clips on the front (I cut them off and replaced them with a couple of small black screwgate carabiners). The carabiners are much easier to open when I want to get to my equipment quickly and the screwgates are nice when I am traveling in crowded places and want to keep my equipment extra secure.All in all it's a great bag and I'm sure I'll be using it for many, many years..."
5,Awesome - don't leave home without it.,"I was looking for a bag that would allow me to take my camera everywhere and still let me carry what I need for work - this is it. Great quality, looks good, comfortable to carry. The velcro closure on the main compartment is good enough that I rarely use the metal clasps (which is good, because they can be fiddly.)I carry: Camera (D70 + 18-70); 70-210 lens; Flash; batteries; filters; Loreo 3D lens; multi tool (leatherman-type thing); notepad & pens, and still have the end compartments empty.I wish it didn't advertise the brand so prominently on each end - I may have to remove those."
5,best bag out the 20 I own and have tried over the years,"I buy a camera bag every year, and that means I have dozens of them. Yes, I do have many digital and film systems, and way too many Nikkor lenses to count. I am using most of these bags for storage of equipment seldom used. But when I travel I have a favorite, last year it was a medium size lowepro. But now it is the Domke. The Domke sand-colored bag seems to be the perfect size for what I carry, my so-called ""A"" kit. This bag hods a Leica M8 and two lenses and its large ugly battery charger, AND it holds the D-700 and battery charger and Nikkor 24-85, 80-200, 20 and 50, all AF-D lenses. So I like it."
4,The bag for all seasons,"This bag, which I own and work out of is well made, roomy and easy to carry. Its day-to-day load includes a 20D/grip, 85/1.8, 28-75/2.8, 70-200/2.8IS, 580EX and meter, Lightsphere, poncho, M530V and charger, extra batts, filters, blank cds, cables. The bag has plenty capacity for the weight I'm willing to carry, and my limit is pretty much where it's at right now, 20 lbs. I also carry around my laptop in a sleeve and more often than not either a 681B, or a 3021BPro/486rc2. I could find another camera bag with more room, but the tradeoff is that it will not get carried around, but left behind in the car or office. The F2 has a nice hand strap, and a very nice shoulder strap that does not chafe or rub my neck. The bag fits behind the seat of my car unobtrusively, and is easy to carry."
4,Lives up to its promise,"This bag is all that its made out to be - I'm very happy with this purchase. Its very comfortable to lug around, and the construction and material quality is very good.I'm using the 4 compartment divider that came with it - which leaves enough space for one body. As I'm considering another body, I'll probably have to prioritise on the stuff I'm carrying around now, and maybe look for a 2-compartment divider or look to stuff some lenses in the side pocket. For the moment, its got enough space for my needs."
4,My desire was satisfied,"I wanted only one case to carry my Sony handcam DCR SR82, Flash SB600, Sima SL-20LX Ultra Bright Video Light, Sima SLB-M Video Bracket, 2 batteries reserve, my Nikon D40 with lens 18-55mm, lens 70-200mm, battery reserves and other items. It is perfect. Everything fit and there's still extra space.I recommend it."
1,Needs different voices,"Our 36 month old loves these books and has since he was tiny. So I ordered three used tapes. The condition was ok enough to realize the voices are odd. He wanted to like it but was confused because the voices weren't geared towards children at all. The casting of the broadway actors was a mistake. ""Martha"" is too deep so it's difficult to tell who is speaking at first. If they could voice over with different voices, perhaps Ellen Degeneras? (she was amazing in Nemo)-- just someone children are drawn to instead of confused. They want to leave it on to see the cartoon and they like ""George and Martha"" but there's something very different than the voices of their parents, or other kid-geared cartoons here. I wouldn't buy another and wonder what to do with these?"
3,Only Lurking in the Lobby,"This book is helpful for those who want to brush up on their ""must have"" Lovecraftian films. In fact, I was surprised by one or two of the additions that I had either forgotten about or hadn't seen because of their easily overlooked releases. Still, it only goes so far on addressing the Lovecraftian equation of the cinema, leaving out some relatively obscure films that have been made and stringing together some really loose ties to others. The banter is sometimes really funny, sometimes really annoying, and oftentimes hit-and-miss with its reviews on the films it speaks of. I would only recommend it if you only want to get your feet wet in the mythos or just have to have anything with the word ""Lovecraft"" attached to it."
2,Just fair,"The problem with this book is the endless tongue in cheek approach which becomes very tiring and seems to show a lack of genuine respect for the material. Some parts are OK, but as a whole this Lovecraft guide is merely fair."
3,Aubusson rug,"After more than a month, this rug is still shedding fuzz all over my room. It seems to be getting less as tme goes by, so I assume it will eventually quit. Other than that, it seems to be of good quality, and it is very pretty."
5,RCA ENCAPSULATES THE THIRTIES,"To celebrate the first 80 years of jazz recording, RCA Victor released a series of CDs in 1997, of which this covered the period 1930-1939. That is, from the onset of the Great Depression until the outbreak of World War Two. It would be impossible to do justice to that period with just one CD, but given the restriction of 25 numbers, and RCA's ease of access to its own masters, I'd like to have seen the net cast wider to include some more obscure outfits, including the so-called territory bands. As it is, none of the recordings presented here is obscure, and most have been the subject of multiple reissues on both LP and CD. That said, presentation is excellent, with the CD contained in a faux brown paper wrapper, a facsimile of the label for Livery Stable Blues (from 1919!), and a very detailed tracklist and liner note."
5,An exciting read with beautiful photos!,"This is a beautiful little book. I enjoyed reading Ms. Rubin's text just as much as the photos. It reads more like a novel than a bio. including little known facts and personal interviews of his family and friends. She makes a point to illustrate the early influences of Steven's family and school life that later became themes for his movies. It is a very intimate look into Speilburg's personal and professional journey. Ms. Rubin has included many formerly unpublished photos. It all adds up to a wonderful read and certainly a lovely addition to your library, especially if you are a fan of Spielberg's work."
3,Shoe is stiff.....,"The quality of the shoe is high, which is why I bought it. However, the shoe never gave even after constant wear. Stayed stiff ..... I also will not miss the shoelaces that never stayed tied!!!"
5,you need one of these,Own a camera? better yet own a DSLR? take a lot of pictures? carry a backpack around with all your gear?Protect your investment. Buy one of these. It fits my Canon 40D perfect with room to spare if I should add a grip.
5,Great buy!,Works just as advertised. Perfect for protecting an extra lens when I toss into my handbag. Great size but not overly bulky.
3,OK product,Buy large size or you'd better use a camera case that fits well. ok product but not very excited about the quality.
5,Love these,When you want to throw a lens or attachment in your backpack or purse these are super for protection and ease of use.
3,"It works, but not as shape forming as I expected","I wish there is slightly more elasticity to the material so when an object is wrapped certain area doesn't pop up or have their corners sticking out.It does a good job for protection, color and texture is satisfactory as well. The 15 in is a bit more useful than the 11 inch wraps in my application."
4,Just What I Was Looking For,I was looking for a wrap to protect my lenses when I would like to carry them in a bag that is not a camera bag. I carry a large bag for all my everyday stuff and my daughters. With a kid and a large carry all I can't really handle an additional camera bag. This wrap met my needs for hauling around an additional lens. I will say I bought 2 wraps and this was the larger of the two and it is large! It was way bigger than I imagined and could completely wrap and camera with a large lens!
4,"Very Sturdy, Prone to Dog Hairs","These wraps are great for use when you're wrapping an odd size object or where space matters are concerned. When I travel I can't take my dedicated lens bags with me due to the bulk. So I carry these wraps and collapsible Domke inserts with me.Only problem with the Domke wraps is that they're made of felt. Since they're felt, sand or abrasive hairs can stick to the material and will sneak in to your gear.I tried the alternative Nikon wraps which have a nylon shell and a tighter nap of felt cloth on the other side. This solution seems to work a bit better. But I'm floored by the cost of these.Check the Nikon wraps here:Nikon Protective Wrap with Nikon Logo - Large (15 x 15"")"
4,good and interesting book,"this book was very good and worth the money, but if you check the paperback book it costs more than the hardcover. why? because the hardcover is not 720 pages like it says. it is only around 180. so i did like the book, but i just wanted to point out the error in the advertisment."
2,Good short attention span book ... but not much else,"There was nothing too special about this collection. Just a sparse collection of little facts about things we take for granted. It was interesting, but the skeptic in me wanted to know how the information was collected, but Voorhees fails to give us a bibliography. Most who know me know I love useless information, but for some reason this did not enthrall me all that much. If you can find this book in paperback cheap, and you like stupid little facts, go for it. But I would not pay more than 5 bucks for itThanks"
4,smarty pants,"SmartyPants is the nickname I've been crowned since owning this book! It's given me a lot of interesting conversation starters. The only complaint I have is the lack of an index, or table of contents so referencing this book can prove a bit timely."
2,This is a beginners intro book.,"I was hoping for something a little more detailed and technical. It is a good overview of the various technologies out there but not reference material. It is prticularly weak on the following topics, RS232, T1, V.35."
3,"Fairly good book, directed at entry level data communication","I'm a student at a community college, evening class. This book is the textbook we're using. It works well in that environment, but I'm not sure an entry level reader will benefit much by using this book without an instructor."
1,Item damaged,"I received terrible service from Surplus Inventories/Graveyard Sales. The stepping stone arrived chipped. I emailed the company twice and received no response. There was no paperwork to tell me how to deal with getting a replacement or return for credit, nor could I track down a phone number. I sent the item back to the address on the shipping label and am hoping for my money back as it is now too late to give as a birthday gift. Very unprofessional."
4,Dave's Not Here...,"We've all had those times where we got blazed with a couple of friends, and then couldn't decide whether we wanted to listen to music, or eat, or sleep or whatever. All you need is this Cheech and Chong CD, some munchies, and your set. This CD is so kick-ass when you're herbalized. After you listen to ""Dave"" you'll bust a gut laughing before you even know it. ""Basketball Jones"" is a killer as well, the sexy cheerleader vocals and hilarious lyrics make it a definate C&C; favorite. Many times I've caught myself headbanging to ""Earache my Eye"", that catchy guitar riff is still stuck in my head to this day. But the biggest gut-buster of the whole album is in ""Sergeant Stadanko"" when Chong says ""Well if it's oregano, you can put it in your soup and eat it. You beaner!"" I nearly wet myself with laughter. I guess you had to be there... Oh well. Everyone should hear this CD, pure genius!Donkey smell..."
5,Dave's Not Here!,"I bought this CD for my brother for Christmas and he loves it. It brought back lots of great memories from ""back in the day"". :0) I'm going to get myself a copy, too."
1,Not what I thought it was,"I bought this album because I wanted the earache my eye skit. How surprised I was to find that this selection is only the song the kid was playing, and has none of the actual skit in it! BOO! I would rate this CD a zero if there was such a rating. If you are looking for the real deal for earache my eye, try the Wedding Album."
4,"Should be ""GH Vol. 1""","These guys have a talent for making the drug culture and otherwise ""minority"" way of life accessible for a nerdy white guy like me. All in all an enjoyable album, but this is coming from someone who grew up on their classic ""Cheech and Chong"" album. This is not a definitive album, though, so don't get your hopes up. We need a second volume, which will include other bits such as Acapulco Gold. So, we should have: ""C&C Greatest Hit, First Toke"" and ""C&C Greatest Hit, Next Toke"""
2,so so,I was hoping it was a different one but oh well. Can't have everything I guess. More 4 words needed?????????
5,Cheech and Chong,This brought me back to my college days. I had many fond memories that came back to me from listeneing. It was wonderful
2,Cold and unmoving,"In 1970, Twentieth Century Fox released ""M*A*S*H,"" a huge box-office smash that put Elliott Gould on the map, and established Robert Altman, a veteran director of TV's ""Bonanza,"" as one of the important figures of 1970's cinema. Much like Gould, Altman quickly burned out, and there's hardly a spark of imagination to be found in ""Quintet.""Set in some barren wasteland of the future, it involves a macabre twist on backgammon in which the loser is murdered. The location, a snow swept Montreal, and the contrasting claustrophobic interior scenes, are appealing to the eye, and the cast, headed by Paul Newman, is not without interest.But ""Quintet"" is as cold and unmoving as its landscapes, simply another credit in Altman's filmography that boasts of his maverick credentials, but makes you wonder why ""maverick credentials"" are something to boast about.Brian W. Fairbanks"
2,Bland Barren Boring Blechh Blah Blah Blah,"Could this be Ishtar in the snow? Altman, Newman, Anderssen, Gassman, with this line-up you expect great things; you get nothing. Understanding the Altman is trying to create a decrepit post-apocalytical world that is covered with snow and ice and where food is running out as most species have been killed; if this movie was any slower you'ld have to run it in reverse. In the first half hour we spend twenty-five minutes watching Newman walk through the snow. The dialogue is so sparse that it's makes a Sylvester Stallone movie seem like a group of chatterboxes.There's little else to say except this was a very large waste of money and talent to tell us that people can be cruel and love blood sport. Suggestion, watch it at double speed so the agony only lasts half as long. You will miss nothing.Zeb Kantrowitz"
4,Pearls of Wisdom,Jean-Yves Leloup has condensed the wisdom earned by years of spiritual discipline into a readable little book of pearls. I keep it by my bedside and read a little every night and then meditate on its meaning as I go to sleep.
3,Would'a been much better with pictures of Vin...,"I wish I'd read the book before I saw the movie. Vin Diesel was such a dominating figure that one might miss the subtle touches within the film. In reading the book one gets a more complete look at the people and the place that will make the next movie viewing even better. I liked the book, will read it again, will keep it on my shelf. That's the highest praise I give."
2,If you enjoy reading screenplays...,"My error, I should have zoomed in on the picture of the book and seen that it was based upon the screenplay. If you want to know the premises behind the movie, by all means read it. If you thought this was the novel upon which the movie was based...forget it."
4,this book is worth reading,"Pitch Black, Though based on a movie, is the tale of a group of intergalactic Earth bound pilgrims who crash land on an uncharted desert planet. The predicament is only made worse by the fact that an anual event of terror is about to take place. Despite the cliche plot and lackluster dialogue, I found the main charectors, Riddick, an escaped convict, and Captain Fry, the callow ship's pilot, along with the plot to be a roller coaster of turmoil both physically and emotionaly. If I had to rate this book on the scale I'd give it a 4 and a reconmendation as a ""lieasure read"""
2,So=so,"I must admit that this book has taken me aback. I was hoping for more reading but the book is very thin (the size, plus big alphabets)... The story line is really similar to the movie although in the book, there are a few twists. I also get more insights into the characters, especially Riddick...Sadly, after reading this book, I don't find Riddick that...intriguing or mysterious anymore...it's a tad bit disappointing. However, this is a well-written book, I truly enjoyed reading it... But if it boils down to watch the movie or read the book, do please save the money to watch the movie... thanks...=)"
2,Cheap Chain,"The pendant was larger than I expected, but the chain was garbage. It was way too long and flimsy and the clasp was broken."
5,Tremendous Storyteller,"What happens when men won't take up the cross and go to the most remote areas of the world to share the gospel? Single women such as Marilyn Laszlo take up the burden. Marilyn has a wonderful way of telling stories that bring her readers right there with her. You understand exactly what she was going through, and are inspired to sacrifice and go yourself--as I was, also in Papua New Guinea."
5,Labor of faith and love,"A great story of the faith and work of a Wycliffe missionary in Papau New Guinea, translating the Bible into the language ofthese people, a language not written at the time. Chronicles 20 + years of a labor of love and a very challenging life amongthe people of the area."
4,Classic Sesame Street Video,"Unlike some of the older Sesame Street videos, I don't mind my son watching this one. He likes Sesame Street. It keeps him entertained."
2,don't bother,"This DVD is often amusing, but completely unsuitable for children learning to read. Words are all but incomprehensible in many of the songs, and some charaters don't articulate the words as well as you would expect (don't get me started on Elmo). It's also too long."
5,"Great intro to words, not just letters","This DVD is set up under the premise that Bert & Ernie, under the direction of Prarie Dawn, put on a play about words. You see both on-stage antics, and the chaos that's backstage. The backstage stuff is reminiscent of the Muppet Show: Grover delivering a singing telegram, people rushing around to get props ready, slipping on banana peels. It's really cute, and my son thinks it's hilarious. During the on-stage scenes, Ernie and Bert introduce different words (cookie, sticky, go, fun, etc.), and then show how new words can be created by switching the letters around. And there's a cool machine that throws pies whenever anyone says the word ""Go"" (of course, Bert gets hit with more than his share of pies). There are some great old-school clips, but mostly new stuff. Lots of songs, and not too much Elmo. I really liked that the focus is on words, not just the letters used. It's a fun, educational video."
3,Semi-entertaining but not very educational,"As a lifelong Sesame Street fan, I was disappointed with this DVD. There are some good clips - even some with Jim Henson's Kermit and Ernie. But as an educational video, the choice of words they characters played with was pretty random and not at all systematic. (One muppet held a sign ""Coo"" and Elmo had ""kie"" to spell ""cookie,"" but the first muppet kept saying ""Cah,"" not ""Coo."") Don't think your child's reading skills will improve much by watching this video. A much better DVD is Ernie's123 Count with Me/Learning About Letters."
4,Nostalgia!,"Back in 1979, when I was eight years old and Star Wars was my life, I used to read this book repeatedly. I treasured it for years, but somewhere along the road it was lost and I completely forgot about it. Now, 33 years later, I have a child of my own and have been slowly introducing him to Star Wars. He's only 3 1/2 but he loved the first film so I decided to seek out this book again and see if it would interest him. It's perhaps a little over his head, but he's surprisingly interested when I read him a few pages of it at night. It's obviously geared for children a bit older, but he follows the story no problem.At any rate, it's been fun for me to revisit it after all these years. There are even a few treats for Star Wars geeks like me, like the brief conversation (and accompanying photo) between Luke and Biggs on Tatooine."
5,Lee Williams Does It Again,This CD Is Very Uplifting And The Songs Are So Good To Listin Too ! Lee Williams Always Give You A Good Show On His DVD. My Father Loves To Listin To Him .Also I Enjoy The Other Singers Who Song On This CD. If You Want To Listin To A Up Lifting And Moving CD This Cd Is The One.
4,Thankful for this CD!,The title song is my favorite. There are many great songs on this CD that I listen to over and over.
3,So Much to be Thankful for,"This is a decent CD. It is worth the money that you will pay for it. However, they seem to be in a different style than some of their other CDs. This is why I only gave it a three star rating. I do enjoy the first track very much!"
5,Excellent,"I consider this book one of a small handful that really goes to the core of understanding trauma and its influence. Other such books include works by Alice Miller, Konrad Stettbacher, and Mortan Schatzman (Soul Murder; out of print; not the book by the same title by Leonard Schengold)."
5,Fantastic Book,This book is well written and well researched. I put it at the top of my list of good information and theory for any survivor.
2,a different approach,"The book seems to offer a perspective for why a child would forget and dissociate from childhood abuse. I appreciated the viewpoints from cognitive science regarding dissociation and memory. They seemed to explain why serious abuse would lead to processes in the brain that highly favor dissociation (to the point of forgetting). But, I wished that the book offered more information on this particular type of dissociation - dissociative amnesia - and also on how the healing process relates to the field of cognitive science and memory."
3,Problems adjusting band,"I like the looks of this watch, but it is very difficult to adjust the band and to put it on and take it off. Not sure how much I will wear it. Sigh."
4,Great Watch,I really like this watch a lot. Although at first the clasp was a little hard to figure and adjust. Other than that this is great watch.
4,"So far, so good","I love the look and feel of Skagen watches. This brown one is very attractive. The crystal on this one broke after just a few months. That was my third Skagen watch with a broken crystal - the first one lasted a couple of years, the second just about one year. I sent all three to get new crystals a few months ago. The service was quick, and the repair price seemed reasonable compared to buying a new watch. So, far, all three crystals are still intact - I hope they last!"
3,Skagen Watch,"While this watch is very attractive, it is quite difficult to put on. The clasp is tricky and I would not recommend this watch if you have a small wrist as you cannot adjust it to fit properly."
3,I enjoyed the book,"I studied ethics under Professor Hurlbutt back in the '80s and enjoyed his lectures immensely. I may not agree with everything he says, but his arguments are logical and not too hard to follow. He was working on this book when I studied under him."
4,Well...,"I give it four stars because it is Amber and she gives this old classic a good dance beat, but it really is nothing to write home about. It would have been nice as a bonus track on the CD or as the B-side to a single."
1,Don't waste your money,This went straight into the trash.I buy many workout dvds and this was the worst one I have ever seen.
1,disappointed,I love Phil Coulter..but this CD has way too much James Galway . Didn't like the combination. Sent it back.
5,excellent celtic instrumental,One of the best Celtic instrumentals I've encountered. Very nice listening. Listen while walking and I forget that I'm walking. A truly excellent value.
4,Ellie needs help.,I like the series but Ellie Pascoe gets on my nerves. The ultra feminist tolerates serial attempted rape from a woman and calls her a friend. Would she put up with such behavior from a man?
4,Clever plot,"The body of local big-shot Pal Maciver is found in a locked room with half of his head blown off and with a number of deliberately placed clues pointing towards his hated step mother, Kay Kafka. Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel is an old friend of Kay so chooses to direct the investigation from the rear, leaving his off-sider, DCI Peter Pascoe to front the team. The strange and very involved past histories of Pal, his two sisters and Kay, their stepmother, become evident, as does the fact that the killing exactly copies the suicide of Pals' father, 10 years previously.I found this to be an immensely readable book, full of suspense and with enough twists and turns to keep the reader glued to it well into the small hours."
3,Too liberal,"I give it three stars. Why three? Because four would mean more creativity -- which it lacks. How does it lack in that respect? It has the same devices as in the previous book: aneurysm ex machina, bookends within the book, a common theme played out with the (bad) characters (and I won't say what), etc. But what irked me the most is Hill's hatred of Thatcherism that goes unspoken until the characters speak it. Hill can say it is not him, but his characters who think that Thatcher was the bane of British political existence. In that way he may think he is free and that conservatives too would buy his book. But that doesn't fool anyone. I figure he should wake up from the 70s culture and be a little more practical... or make his characters such. His characters are bumblers normally and their flaws are huge, so why drag in the flaw of anti-Thatcherism? Yes, maybe he is not a liberal -- only his characters are. But I doubt it."
4,Good Disc,"a voice can make all the difference and Michael Mcdonald is the X-Factor here.He rips You Belong to me,What a fool believes&Minute by Minute.Real Love is a tight cut as well.The Band sounds Good all the way through."
3,Doobie Brothers Lite,"The second of the Brothers' ""Best"" covers the downslide caused by Michael McDonald's rise to prominence in the group. While there are some worthwhile tracks. This is strictly Doobies 'after the fall.' For a better look at the group, you should seriously consider the ""Best of"" volume one. Or, if you must have these tracks, go for the box set ""Long Train Runnin' 1970-2000"" which also covers their rise from the ashes in the late eighties."
2,skip it,"Released to capitalize on the success of (and collapse of) the Doobie Brothers after ""One Step Closer,"" this best of gathers most of the hits from ""Minute By Minute"" and ""One Step Closer,"" adds a couple album cuts and tries to pass itself off as a ""Best Of.""You can do better - on 2000's ""Greatest Hits"" and 2007's double ""Very Best Of,"" each with upgraded sound. Leave this one in the dust bin."
2,Vol. 2 not as big as Vol. 1.,"The Doobie Brothers just have solid music. Vol. 1, released in 1976, was still quite good and, to me, defined the idea of a ""Greatest Hits"" album. It's saying something when I had that original release on an 8-Track cartridge inherited from my parents.So here's Vol. 2 and it mainly showcases the Michael McDonald years. The problem I have with it is that it is a short release (definitely shorter than Vol. 1). And certainly Michael McDonald had many more hits with the Doobies than what's chronicled here. One may be led to believe (what a fool) that the official Warner archives are lacking. But the cover artwork looks slick. Too slick. Like a distraction.For McDonald lovers,The Very Best of Michael McDonaldis much better in regards to his post-DB solo work. And it wasn't until Rhino got involved with DB's discography that made Vol. 2 obsolete."
2,GET VOLUME 1 INSTEAD,Sleepy pop ballads that make perfect Muzak now (hearing them reminds me of being in an elevator). The Best of the Doobies Vol. 1 is by leaps and bounds when the Doobies recorded thier classics. These latter day Doobie efforts are like Steely Dan on Sominex
2,this isn't the REAL Doobie Brothers,"get vol 1. The couple of hits on this one are too few to be worth the money. The whole CD is way too ""McDonalded"". Doobies and schlock...so very sad. repeat, get vol 1. Instead."
1,Not the original recordings.,"These are not the original recordings of his most famous songs (Volare, for example) but re-recordings he did for RCA Italy from the early 60s to the 70s. The original recordings on the Fonit Centra label are now owned by warner music italy."
5,Grammar Boring? It Ain't Necessarily So!,"I just loved this book! How does it manage to make learning about English grammar fun--got me, it just does. The author covers common mistakes and challenges while keeping you rolling in the aisle with her humor. The book is well organized so what you need is easy to find. If you buy one grammar book this year (and who needs more than one grammar book?) make it this one. You'll actually read it, which is half the battle."
5,Read it for Fun!,"Yeah, I know it sounds weird; who reads grammar books for fun? But Laurie Rozakis infuses this solid guide with her own brand of quirky humor, and it works beautifully. Wonderful quotes from famous writers add spice to the stew. Try it, you'll like it."
3,Bad grammar in a grammar text. Buyer beware,"page 68. Past Perfect. Action completed before another. ""I had eaten all the tofu before you returned."" Condition completed before another. ""I had been sad before the new tofu arrived."" Past Perfect Progressive. ""I had been snoring when the house collapsed."" Present perfect progressive. Action going into the present. ""I have been snoring all week.""This is disgraceful. She should know better but she obviously doesn't. Or maybe she thinks it's funny but the joke is on the reader. Stay away from this one. You can't say the title didn't warn you.Her author page says, ""Dr. Rozakis is an expert on writing, grammar, usage.."" What could be further from the truth? The publisher shares the blame for letting this nonsense get into print. Buyer beware.(I ATE all the tofu, I WAS sad, I WAS snoring, and I SNORED all week, which is too dumb to be allowed on the streets unsupervised. Shameful and idiotic, all of it.)"
4,Not bad,"Over all the Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Style offers good information that is usually easy to understand. However, the child-like humor ruined it for me. The auther often talks down to you as if you are truely an idiot, which I find unprofessional. There are wierd sentences scattered through out the book, such as, sacred cows, which are holy, make the best hamburgers. What the hell kind of sentence is this? Perhaps she has something against Hindus. Between the odd sentence examples and child-like humor you will find good information. Sometimes the author says things like I guarantee you will understand such and such after you finish this chapter, but the chapter is short and not clear at all. I was debating giving this book 3 stars, but it does a good enough job to earn 4."
3,Still lost!,"I am still lost as to what nouns, adverd, ajectives, ect are, their brief description and lack of examples leaving me frustrated."
2,Not for ESLs,"I bought this book and read it, it is interesting however, it includes many jokes inserted in between subjects which I could not understand, that's may be because English is my second language, and I felt that all I am wasting my time reading unnessary jokes which for some people might be funny. If English is your second language, I do not recommend buying it."
5,An excellent book for beginners.,"An excellent book to teach grammar, style and punctuation for beginners, and those who want to improve there English. Full of good examples and tests to evaluate your progress."
5,Perfect way to cary your photo supplies,"I do nature photography.Pros:LightweightCustomizableEasy to access lenses/water bottle/anything else on it. 10X better than a regular photo backpack.Stays clean because you don't have to put it on the ground to switch lensesDurability is superb.Lifetime defect warranty.Cons:Pretty expensiveMade in china- bad for the environment, bad for human health; Lens cases smell terrible when you get them."
4,"Funny, sexy and, yes, scared me once.","The idea behind the movie is that three girls have started a club that deals with ghosts, ghouls and the supernational. Their teachers keep asking them to deal with the problems within their own school and in others. They finally meet their match in a very poverful ghost who, in life, was a very rich and very perverted man who enjoyed visiting the brothels. And now, even in death, he wants to have the pleasure of you-know-want.It is funny, sexy and, yes once I did jump back in surprise. Once. Most of the time I just found the thing a delight to watch. The one point has been taken away because the whole thing feels like somebody did it with a bad video camera. I've seen XXX-Rated films with more money poured into them. But, frankly, they didn't turn out as good.Try to get it, but better watch out, even used it cost me a lot."
2,It Wants To Be Manga,"This movie is about as bad as it gets. While the actors and actresses are all very attractive, the poor quality of the acting is actually distracting.Beyond that, the ""special effects"" are outdone by even Ed Wood. Watching this I was reminded of low budget Nickelodeon. The problem with that is this is in no way meant for kids as the ""Ghosthustlers"" are dealing with ""erotomaniac spirits"".The ghosts are simply super imposed (badly), and what's worse, they are dealt with by their special ghosthustling equipment which are two vacuum cleaners with vegetable steamers for pots glued onto them.The writing was so bad I actually felt insulted. Take the attitude of ""Saved By The Bell"", the style of ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" and the tension of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and this is what you get.Avoid this movie!"
1,NOT FOR KIDS!,"This movie is nasty! I don't suggest young kids to view this movie at all! It starts out cute then the sex crazy demons come and take over the body of women. Allowing them to control men, once they have sex with them, they kill them."
1,I've decided,"After watching this movie a total of 1.5 times, and talking to some of my friend who I have let borrow it, we have come to the conclusion that Ghosthustlers is, in fact, porn with a plot. And you know, the sad thing is, my friends and I are 14/15 years old, just buying it to look for something funny.The movie quality, itself, is bad too! The picture looks like a comcorder and the sound is nothing different.I'm a big supporter of TokyoPop and thats why I initially bought this, but please, KEEP YOUR MONEY!"
3,good granola but sloppy packaging,"They inadvertently slit open packages opening boxes with a box cutter - this happens way too much (you get a box from amazon, and a package of granola has already been slit open)."
5,Great product,Excellent granola. I got a good price but this brand is a little more expensive than others like Bear Naked. But the original Udi's has more nuts and fruits in it. Can't get that quality with Bare Naked
5,fx review,This toy is very easy to handle and is good for indoor and outdoor use.I highly reccomend this toy.
3,it was fun while it lasted,"Well, this is extremely fun a fight with, and very intimidating. but on the first day i got mine, i was fighting my friend, and the connector piece broke. you can imagine i was very upset. i would recommend buying this, it is really fun to play with, just take it easy if you are going to fight with it."
4,cool,"I love my lightsaber, though only after a week of having it one of the sabers quit working on me, idk what to do, if anyone could help me it would be cool, it doesnt turn on or anything, and i checked the batteries and they are new. just wondering do they make a count Dooku FX lightsaber???"
3,"Nice sound, so-so songs","I love this style of rock, big fuzzed-toned guitars with group vocals (no particular voice stands out here), songs like ""Come My Sunshine"" really hit the mark. The same sound can be taken down a notch and turned into a bliss out like ""Now I'm a Spider"" and works just as well. The only problem here is that the material doesn't rise to match the sound. ""Red Microphones"" is a good example of a song that tries to build around a hook that just isn't there, and ends up meandering off when the center falls apart. I don't know what they can do about the song writing, probably nothing - some people can write hooks (and become music gods) and some can't. Possibly they will get lucky, but for the meantime it would help if they concentrated on maintaining a groove, because switching gears just wrecks a song like ""New Wolf"" that could have worked."
2,"Too Rushed, Low on Feeling","I've really tried to like Brian Osawa but when I hear this CD, it sounds to me like he's faking his way through the songs, though I doubt he in fact is. It's passionless.Thankfully I bought this CD used for only $9.99 CDN. Regretably, I will likely be selling it back to the used CD store from which it came. Daniel Taylor and James Bowman's Love Bade me Welcome would be a much better selection, i bought it new and its worth every cent!"
4,Good Neighbors Royal Command Performance,"The ""Royal Command"" was a lot of hype. The show itself was as usual Very Goog."
1,This is not DJ Jonathan Peters from NYC,I bought this thinking it was DJ Jonathan Peters from NYC. Very disappointed when I got the CD. It's all Oprah/Classical music made in California.
5,Tom Leonard's Nora's Place and other poems,"This is a selection of readings Tom Leonard recorded of various poems, many of them from his Intimate Voices: Selected Poems (a hard to get but extremely important volume). Leonard broke barriers by writing poetry in Glaswegian Scots dialect. If you've read any of Leonard's poems, but not heard him read them, this is a great opportunity!"
5,My Favorite Chopin-Van Cliburn,"My mother bought this album when it was released. It soon became one of my favorites and I ended up listening to it more than she did. (Of course I listened to the pop music of the day.) One of the nice memories of spending time with my mother was listening to this Van Cliburn record together. (Yes, it was vinyl.) The quality of the recording is excellent."
5,My Absolute Favorite Chopin Album,If I was stuck on a deserted island this would be one the albums I would want with me! I have loved this album deeply since I was a child and will listen to it the rest of my life. In my book no one can touch Van Cliburn playing Chopin. Truly inspired.
4,easy is correct,"It is what i need for fast translations. It does exactly as advertised. No complicated training required. It is NOT for complex conversations, but gets you to the topic of discussion"
4,Worth the Read,"I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like the book, but as you get to know the characters it grows on you and by the end you say ""I really enjoyed that"" it is alittle pat at the end, but then again it is fiction. I will definately try another from this author."
4,"It's my bag, baby. Yeah.","I wish I owned one of these ten or even twenty years ago. This bag is as close to perfect as I've encountered. Construction is solid, the canvas is reasonably durable. I waterproofed it with a spray-on product from a local camping/outdoorsman's shop.The best thing about this bag, though, is the size. Not too big, not too small. It is perfect for my Nikon D1x (F5-size) with lens, an additional lens or two, both spare batteries, SB-28DX flash, my Linux subnotebook, several compact flash cards, and lens cleaning kit.With some cramming, I have been able to squeeze an F100 camera body in as a film backup, but this is not a comfortable fit for the bag. I have a larger bag for when I need more gear, though.This bag is perfect for light-to-medium travel. In other words, most of the time.Cheers!"
5,another great domke bag!,"Well, I've bought another fantastic Domke bag. It's a little smaller then any I've owned in the past, but it will more then make up for its size. I'm doing photojournalist work again, and this bag lets me carry a camera with battery pack, two lens, filter, memory cards, flash [if needed] and note pad and pen. All in a small bag that is easy to carry. The rugged ware look is cool also. When the weather is bad, it protects my stuff, and the strap is more then comfortable. I've owned about 5 Domke bags in my 30 plus years as a photographer, and think this is the best! Thank you Domke, keep up the good work!Domke F-3X Super Compact Domke Ruggedwear Bag"
5,A real super compact,"Its a bag i am looking for for a long time.I am a Canon user, owning a 40D and 400D, a couple of lens. I own a couple of camera bags as well. From Lowepro, tarmac, to bagman etc. Of course each had its own usage for different job and needs.Recently i am trying to find a bag which can fit 2 DSLR, 2-3lens, 2EX580II and some additional stuff like CF Cards, and Batteries.When i receive my bag, wao it does looks small but due to the fatter design in the main compartment, it can even fit 2 DSLR with lens mounted, 1 70-200 F2.8 unmounted and 85mm unmounted. That is alot of equiptment in 1 small bag.The side pocket can easily fit a EX580II (with case on) each.The only part I dont really like is that the velcro at the side pocket could be slightly bigger. :)"
5,"Could Use More Padding, But I don't Mind","As other reviewers have said, it could be more protective, but for casual usage when I go hiking or out with friends I feel perfectly comfortable bringing my camera in this. So I'm giving it 5 stars because it meets all my needs.The build quality is superb, it looks great, and it's really the perfect size for everyday use. I'm sure glad I got this over the smaller more compact version. I have enough room to carry anything I want along with my dslr with lens mounted, and another lens. Because it's so comfortable I find myself bringing it along whenever I leave the house because it's a convenient place to leave my belongings, and that's just what I'd want from my camera bag."
4,Great pedal but could be better,"I got this to use as a percussion pedal for hand drumming. It works great, but it would be even better if the angle adjustment had a better design. To adjust the angle or tension of the pedal, you have to remove one or two screws on the bottom and put them back again. The downside is that the screws carve out threads directly in the plastic, so after replacing a screw once or twice, it's really easy to strip the hole. This makes it hard to adjust the angle frequently for different kinds of instruments. It would be a lot better if the screws had metal slots that lasted longer."
5,Hansenfutz Futz Practice Pedal,"This is a great practice tool. It's virtually silent, and very easy to carry around because of its light weight. I have used this at my day job for months, and no one even knows I am practicing when I have it under my desk. It has definitely produced results in my playing in both strength and control.The Hansenfutz practice pedal is approximately the size of a bass drum pedal, and the plate is slightly larger than most pedals I've used. That being said, it's in no way unwieldy or cumbersome to carry. Using it feels pretty close to playing on a drum; it's approximately the equivalent of working out your hands on a gum rubber pad. This product is far superior in feel and portability to any other practice pedal system I have come across, and is the only all-in-one product I have seen. I can recommend this to anyone looking to improve his or her feet when a full drum set is not an option."
3,Funny as Saturday Night Live in parts,"This is a stupid movie and not really worth releasing on DVD because you only want to see it once or twice, to point out the few jokes to other people. However, because it was written by Buck Henry and co-starred Gilda Radner, it sometimes has the feeling of Saturday Night Live. In one scene, the President is waving at a crowd with a mechanical dummy, knowing that the people hate him and may want to assassinate him. A woman throws a tomato and knocks the dummy's head off and the crowd is confused as it rolls in the street. It is a little politically incorrect, as it makes fun of native African cultures, but does not rely on ethnic humor."
3,An somewhat odd but still enjoyable Hitchcock film,"This one has no real mystery, but instead traces the problems faced by a young couple who unexpectedly come into a great deal of money. The movie makes interesting use of intertitles to alert the viewer to what is going on, making it feel almost like a silent film at times.The quality of the video and audio are inferior, and while there is a restored version available on DVD, I haven't seen it so I can't compare."
3,An Early Hitchcock Talkie,"Nothing like an early classic nor one with much chance of being remembered, Rich and Strange does show flashes of the humor, dramatic tension, casting and cynical view of human nature, which mark his best films. In the young married woman of the couple whose adventures we follow, we have his beautiful blond, although not much else of interest among the other players. What appears to be a romantic comedy turns dramatic, when each is attracted to another. There is a resolution which involves the strength of one, who recognizes the weakness-dependency of the other. Finally, we find a denouement, in which there is essentially a return to the status quo ante. Not a film I feel I can recommend, save as an historical document showing the apprenticeship of one of the first rank of movie directors."
4,lowepro road runner backpack,"My camera and multiple lenses, filters, etc. stay packed in this backpackready at a moment's notice to ""hit the road."" It is reasonably comfortable,even for my 5' 5"" frame and a significant hike through woods, fields, mountains.The disadvantage of a backpack, is that you have to take it off to change a lens.This is impractical in many settings, and hence, I often use the backpack throughthe airports, or during ""hikes"" when I am not photographing, or in the caron the way to a location, but then switch to ThinkTank belt system when actuallyshooting. The ThinkTank system allows rapid access to each lens, as they hangaround your waist on a belt. This encourages experimenting with different lensesand being more creative which is not the case (or practical) when you have totake off a backpack, find a suitable place to lay it down, unzip, etc.Bottom line: you probably need BOTH a backpack like this AND a belt systemsuch as Think Tank."
2,i didn't really care for this book because,"i didn't really like *any* of the projects. really, for me nothing spectacular or even wearable here.i know that sounds harsh, but what i really mean to say is:before buying this book you might want to find it in a bookstore and flip through it to see if there's anything in it you like. i bought it from amazon in good faith based on the reviews and wish i'd saved the money for more beads."
2,earrings,For what they cost I guess you can't complain BUT they are cheap looking in personwouldn't buy again
2,Watch your old vcr tapes if you have them.,"Just a big downer the whole set. Ok the opening music you can look pass that, but if you are a die-hard fan you can see this season is edited to s**t. Nothing worse then watching a show you pretty much know and you say hey it's missing a section like in the Christmas one, Vegas one, Weather one, I can go on and on. You would expect to see that on re=runs on TV but on something that you dish out 30 plus $$ for I say it's a rip off on the public. There is nothing on the box set to tell you that they have been edited. No way will I buy the next season till I read some reviews. Your better off if you have them on tape is to either burn them for yourself or watch the tape and fast foward thru the commercials. SHAME ON SONY."
4,Christina Applegate really made MWC,It was a hit due to this great beauty more than anyone else. Her Kelly character got even better as the series wore on. So very interesting as well as beautiful is her Kelly Bundy character.
3,Bring on Season Five,I'am a huge fan of MWC. I'm waiting for the DVD season with Jefferson and the men organization NO MAAM to hit the stands. To me these are the best episodes of Married with Children. Get Season Four to wet the appetite and await Season Five.
5,Just turn your brain off,"Just turn your brain off, be relaxed, and enjoy the classic TV show Married...with Children on DVD. You'll laugh your @$$ off, you'll find Al Bundy as your idol, and you'll have a desperation to pre-order the next season as soon as possible."
4,great season! however...,"Its a Great season, full of classics, probably their all time best. However...it seems they couldnt afford the usage of their theme sonf anymore or something because the theme song is no longer ""love and marriage"" by frank sinatra. Instead its some other song they made up to imitate that song! Quite bogus if u ask me. I was quite dissapointed between episodes. But other than that a good season to have."
2,BAD BAD BAD,"I am so tired of buying TV shows on DVD just to get the edited syndicated versions. The reason I bought this DVD set was for the Sam Kinison episodes Its A Bundyful Life. I have an old vhs tape of this show and have seen it dozens of times, I know most of the lines, so I could tell when lines were missing. I love the show and it deserves better treatment than this. How sad."
3,Set contains 7 Syndicated episodes,"Well Sony blew it with this set.7 episodes are the syndication episodes-Edited! Yes i'm planing on buying this set,because not all the episodes will be cut,just 7-I would not mind if it was 1 or 2 episodes,but 7!! that is dumb! 5 stars for the show,3 stars for this DVD release.Update-go to tvshowsondvd.com to find out why Sony use Syndicated episodes on the 7 episodes.Also if you bought the 2 best of sets of Married...with Children keep it, as it contains the uncut episode of Raingirl,one of the episodes that gets the syndication treatment in the season 4 set."
2,disappointing,"We purchased this specifically for ""Its a Bundyful life"". Its such a great christmas special. We have it on VHS but want DVD and they dont sell it alone. They cut out a lot of the lines."
5,Spectacular !!! I love this & watch it over & over again.,This is the greatest movie & therapeutic learning of self discovery. It's the kind of movie I can leave on often while I'm doing other things. It can guide me thru each day w/how I choose to live each day. Love it !!!!
1,What was that?!,I couldn't even stay focused on it. I was multi-tasking during my movie quiet time. I did chores to escape this movie. It is great if you need something to go to sleep to.MAN--that movie was a complete waste of money!
2,Read the books!,"This movie was okay but if you read the books you will see how much you are missing. They are the type of books that once you read them, they keep coming back to haunt your thoughts until to read them again and again."
1,The Celestine Prophecy,"This movie was so awful it was embarrassing. The book was entertaining, as I remember anyway, but the film was just excruciating. The acting was totally unconvincing and the plot was...... was there a plot? Can I think of anything good about it? I don't even think the scenery and cinematography were memorable. Don't even watch it on cable for free."
3,Lackluster,"I purchased the movie ""The Secret"". Loved it. Great movie. I then purchased this movie - The Celestine Prophecy. It's an okay movie to watch, but it didn't provide me with the same degree of inspiration or personal awakening as ""The Secret"". If you're wanting a decent movie to watch for pleasure, buy this. If you're looking for a movie that is insightful and thought provoking, look for another movie."
2,Unable to play anywhere,"For some strange reason, this DVD will not play on any PC's, laptops, DVD players, or even PS3s. The DVD box states that the DVD was created in the U.S. and made to play in the U.S. I have gone to friend's houses, relative's houses, but to no avail. I cannot play the DVD. I was very excited to have been able to find it since I read the book a few years back. I will have to find this movie by other means. I just wish I hadn't thought I would eventually find somewhere that I could actually play it. Hence why I did not return the DVD in the allotted time to receive a refund."
2,"Horrible Acting, Choppy storyline.","Glad I saw this for free with Amazon Prime. The acting in this move was beyond pathetic. It seems the goal of this movie was to explain the Celestine Prophecy. It fails miserably. Ater watching this movie, I had no idea until the end what it actually was about. They explained the 9 parts of it in writing, right before the credits. It did not explain how you get to this specialized evolutionary state, just that you have to open yourself up. Achieving the level of spirituality described in this movie would take many, many years of prayer, meditation, and dedication to the faith. One would not be able to fall into it like the main character in this movie. I really would not recommend this movie to anyone."
3,Manuscript in Hebrew,"An ubiquitous gringo finds himself searching for who-knows-what in Peru, attracting an over-exaggerated attention from local junta and clergy while lucky co-accidents united him with alike-delighted new age followers having saved his life on many occasions and securing his safe deportation to the USA, no further word of them left behind at the end.Rarely screened both picturesque Peruvian landscapes/urban areas and vibrant adventure are good for educating the young teens if realistic and a film was less peppered with out-of-this-world philosophical deliberations."
4,"Good, but the book was better","If you are a fan of the book you will want to see the movie. It is pretty low budget, but the message is still there. Hopefully the movie will get more people to read the book. If you even found the movie there is a reason for it and you should explore that. Happy viewing!"
4,Must see,"Must see for those interested in opening their awareness of what's really going on with and between people that would have us compete, rather than being close and working with each other for the good of all.Puts what many are already trying to achieve on the planet in a relatively simple form to assist us to become more aware of the possibilities and gifts available for all.Looking forward to the next in the series of James Redfield's Celestine visions."
4,"As good as the book, uh, not really","As far as how the product arrived, the shipping process etc, it was all good. As far as the product itself, has a lot of good actors for an underground kind of movie. Helped explain many concepts in the book and captured the essence of the Celestine Prophecy completely. Seeing auras portrayed so clearly comes off as a little unbelievable, though."
3,"Without reading the book,, the movie loses something","The dramatization from book to screen play needed more than time allowed for a motion picture. Without the book's development of the characters and concepts, the movie became a ""little light headed"", but still an enjoyable visual reminder of the exciting events that took place in the book."
2,just below entertaining,"Started out not too bad with fairly interesting plot, but made less sense as the movie continued. Found myself looking at the clock to see when it would end. Watched until the end hoping for some ""wow-factor"" ending, but it was a little bit disappointing. There were several scenes within the movie where it felt like they were explaining (their) religion to you, although it was intended for the character nodding his head in understanding. The movie plot really was kinda poor since the main theme seemed to be to share this religious outlook with you and to fashion it into a story somehow that didn't quite flow so well. Wasn't the worst religious movie I've seen, but was just below entertaining for me and if I could, I would take back those two hours of my life. Would have preferred to learned about this religion (read or watched) something more direct instead of seeing this somewhat cheezy, low-budget film that it was delivered though. Just my opinion though."
2,Disappointing,"There is very little substance in this movie and the plot is very generic. I would not recommend it, especially not for the scenery."
5,Love this movie!,I love the way this film demonstrates people are to exchange energy with each other (give and receive) and not try to drain each other.
4,interesting and entertaining,My family enjoyed this film....the action sequences satifisfied the males and the females liked the images which demonstrated energy and how people exchange energy....
3,The Celestine Prophecy,"I found the moving interesting, however the book was much more moving and enlightening."
3,celestine prophecy movie fails to meet expectations,"I personally think that the Celestine Prophecy is the most important book written in half a century at least. The movie not only failed to carry the impact of the teachings, but gave little incentive for people to read and study the book."
1,Not happy Jan....,"Sorry but I have to disagree with the above reviews. While I enjoyed the book I found the film to be a turn off. While the scenery was nice it didn't come anywhere near to being as good as the actually written story.It seems to race around everywhere and I felt it combined parts from the 1st book and the 2nd book.And what was the deal with the ""Obi-wan Kenobi"" priest at the end??? I don't recall it being like that in the book.I'm not against new age but this was really wishy washy and turned my friends off even wanting to read the book.I know it's about co-incidences but the major one here is that co-incidentally my friends hated it.Try the book. It's better value for money."
2,Read the book first!,"For those who are interested in the Celestine Prophecy, I recommend reading the book first. The movie viewer may be a little confused by the storyline without any previous knowledge of the book. Although the movie delivers the main ideas of the Prophecy, a lot of important philosophy has been left out. In general it is a fun movie experience. Anyone interested in the laws of attraction, energy, or spirituality will relate to this movie."
4,The World We Would Like to See,"The movie is good, but the book is better. The whole idea is a bit on the ""New Age"" side of things. But it is a good adventure - both in reading and in thinking. Both the book and the movie are well worth the time."
3,Slower than DiVinci,At first I thought this would be a lot like the DiVinci Code but here the Church is so much the bad guy as it is the political manipulators of the world though it is a bit vague who the main enemy is and who he's working for. I have not read the book so I can't say how close the movie is to it. I did think the ideas of the prophecy are fairly standard fare for new age spirituality which should not lessen them in any way: shouldn't truth be truth regardless of when or how it is revealed? I felt each character was a bit brushed over quickly never really allowing me to feel too close to any one of them but I did get the sense that they believed in what they were doing. I'd actually give this movie 3.5 stars it if were possible because I felt the characters were sincere and the situation possible if not probable.
3,The book is obviously better but....,"I am glad I bought this movie and although it was a very condensed version of the book, the characters and cinematography we interesting and at least a little bit of the ""message"" from the book is delivered. It was entertaining and we were glad we bought it."
2,Disappointed,"I own the book and I was hoping the movie would live up to some of the philosophies therein. Unfortunately Celestine plays like a bad ""Lifetime"" movie with weak characters and undeveloped plot. Instead it seems like a 90-minute ""new age"" seminar speech delivered by Soap Opera actors.The theory behind the movie of ""two worlds"" and being able to see ""it"" may be well founded, but its been done better before by other films. If you want to see better executed movies about ""two worlds"" get The Matrix, They Live, Invasion of The Body Snatchers. There are people that will get what I am talking about because they have ""opened their eyes"" and then the ones that have not probably have no idea.Don't waste your time. The latter movies just have better setting for the premise. Not every book doesn't deserve big screen treatment."
1,Shame!,"This is the most embarrasing film I have ever seen, and I'm pretty certain that I won't see anything this embarrasing for the rest of my life.Everything is embarrasing: the acting, the plot (plot? what plot?), the scenery, the special effects (special??), everything.And for those who claim it has a profound message: the author made up all the story, there's no such thing as these prophecy rolls!Come on, this cliche is what you'd call profound message?What a shame."
4,gets the message across,The book changed my thinking when it came out years ago and so I was excited to see it on DVD. It appears to be a low budget movie but it gets the message across. I have enjoyed it enough to have watched it a few times.I even bought it for my best friend before her trip to Peru.
3,Well.......,"I read and enjoyed the book and was very much looking forward to seeing the movie.I think it lost something in the translation.However if you've not read the book, you might enjoy it.Rent it first. Or better yet, if you haven't already, read the book.xoxMEF"
2,book is much better than movie,"the book went into great detail and the movie just kind of skimmed through almost as if it was expecting i had read the book. had i not read the book first, i wouldnt know how great the story truely is. READ THE BOOK, its excellent"
4,Intuition and Synchronicity Explained,"For a while, ""coincidences"" have been happening in my life and they've started to happen in other peoples' lives as well, such as friends and family.This movie really helped me understand the nature of coincidences and how powerful and influential they can be in our lives. I also have been opened up to new ways of thinking about how the world works, and in a small way, what it means to be human, to connect, and to relate with other people.Some of the concepts in this film may go over the heads of people who do not consider themselves to be 'spiritual,' but for them I recommend the movie even more highly if they are open to possibilities that can be observed but not explained by modern science.At times, the cinematography seems a bit... b-rate. And the dialog can be cheesy at times. If the movie had those two things, I'd give it a 5. However, for what it is and tries to be, it's still worth watching and owning.Chris Cadehttp://www.Spiritual-Short-Stories.com"
2,Book Better.,"Better read the book then watching the video.I bet you, people that never read the book would never able understand the story in the video."
5,MUST SEE!,"Excellent opportunity to ""see"" what it is about, how the world is changing, and our roll on it. A real mind-opener, and for the ones that are already on the spiritual path, a confirmation, that this is it. Thanks James Redfield for the book and the enlighment!"
4,Different and spritually sound,"From the Spanish land grants and the Moors (the shangri-la like jungles). To the 9th and maybe 10th scrolls this movie is a sleeper, and leaves you with something to chew on."
1,Wish I read the book.,I've heard that the book is 100x better than the movie this film was utter garbage. The acting was poor the plot was papaer thin not to mention bad. I do not recommend this film I have to say this is one of the worst film I have seen this year. If your into the new age stuff then this is your cup of tea but this will certainly not impress allot of people.
1,The book is much better,"I was expired with the book and bought the CD after encountered an add in Amazon.But the movie is very week, it does not show any spiritual experienceIt's not easy to show it in the movie but possibleSorry"
1,"REALLY, REALLY POOR!!!","The irony, here, is that I am one who accepts ""alternate"" philosophies and possibilities. But, for me, this was the flip-side of the coin for xtian propaganda. It was so ""New Age"" touchy-feely that I thought I was going to overdose from a sugar overload! The ""End of Days/ Rapture"" crowd have their ""champions"". Evidently, the ""New Age"" crowd has theirs, as well. If you have an actual functioning brain, avoid either of these extremes...unless you are looking for some high-comedy, late at night.Very, very POOR!!!"
2,The Celestine Prophecy,"I was disappointed in the movie as it did not go into depth in regards to the insights, the book was absolutley fantastic due to this fact, but I feel the movie did not capture this which disappointment me. On the other side it was a move forward to awakening the people in regards to a more spiritual awakening."
4,celestine prophecy,"The movie, what was of it, followed the author's book pretty closely, However I think that they could have added much more to it. I think they left out vital information that may cause people who have not read the book to wonder what it's all about."
1,Complete fiasco of a movie. Just exasperating...,"I'm very sorry to say that this is one on the worst movies I have ever seen. The ""insights"" developed by the author are absolutely wonderful bits of... insight, and deserve the exposure they have received. Mr. Redfield should have not listened to his intuition (probably tainted by ego) but let professionals helm this movie. They would have smoothed out the naivté and just plain awfullness. The only reason I watched this movie through (although in two sittings, I couldn't take the whole thing at once, too bored and exasperated) was because I hoped that the strength of the ""insights"" would offer a bit of exhaltation or SOMETHING. Nope, only exasperation and frustration at the wasted opportunities for an uplifting film. How anyone (especially a fan of the ""insights"") can not hate this movie is mind-blowing."
1,The Celestine Prophecy,"Having read the book, I was aghast at the violence that predominated in the film and the lack of the messages brought forth in the book. The acting was good, but the direction taken in the film was not that of the author. While the book lacked professional editing, it did have a message that was taken to heart by many. The film belittles the message."
5,I love the smell,"I hate the smell of baby powder, but I actually love the lavender scent. This is the only baby powder I like to use."
1,Broke with in two weeks..ordered from amazon.com,Would not recommend this brand..and I will not br wasting anymore of my money on any product with this brand name ..
1,Surebonder 9615,"It never worked right from the beginning. It would fire 1 staple and the hammer would not retract. I'd force the hammer back up, shoot 1 staple and have to force it back up again. Returned after 5 staples!"
3,Never used,i bought this thinking it was a staple gun (one without air) but it wasn't so i sold it to a handyman next door and he loves it....so i assume it's a stand up product!
2,Jammed,"This worked well until it jammed which unfortunately was only after about 300 staples. The gun itself was easy to load and the indicator window on the side was nice. I completely disassembled the gun but where the staple is lodged is not in a place that can be removed. I took a chance on this product from the good reviews, even after seeing the complaints about jamming. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Came broken,"Hooked it up, and the staples wouldn't shoot out. It came with a broken trigger. We returned it and got a plug in one."
2,worth what you paid for it,"I took a chance because of the great price. It isn't a bad staple gun, and it isn't a good one either. Jams too frequently and is difficult to clear.I will purchase a different staple gun that is better built."
2,Paperweight,I could not find staples to fit this unit. Looked in 2-3 hardware stores. I ended up buying a very similar model and it worked just fine.
4,Lids not included!,"These are great stackable containers, made in USA. Be sure to order lids, because they don't come with the containers. They're an additional $2.36. The company was very nice about waiving the extra postage when I contacted Customer Service. They did say this was a repeat problem, so I think the description should include the fact that they're topless, especially since the photo shows lids, and the description mentions that the lids match the writing on the containers."
4,"Warm, Fuzzy, and Good","This blanket works well, is soft and light weight, and is a good price. The wires are not bulky or distracting. It heats up quickly and the automatic shut off feature is reasuring."
1,Buyer beware,"I thought I was the only one, but I also have to buy a new one every single year. Now, after 4-5, I have learned, and will try another brand. Don't be fooled by the fancy name, as I was. They die after one season, no matter how careful you are with them. We even tried not fold, sit on or wash them. Buyer beware."
2,Works well for one season.,"We were very happy with our Sunbeam thermal blanket last winter. Unfortunately, after the first year, the blanket gradually decreased the amount of heat it put out. It's now barely warm after being on for a few hours at the highest setting.The blanket has never been washed, is always kept on the bed, and we don't even sit on the bed!The only way to treat it more gently would have been to leave it in the original package and never use it!We've owned Sunbeam heating pads which have worked for years - I can't imagine why they aren't able to have the same reliability with a blanket."
5,worth every penny,We have gotten other blankets at a lower brice but if you want to stay waem this is the ticket it works great and the pre heater sure is nice. This is a very nice blanket and will keep you warm.
5,A Perfect Ending to a Long Cold Day!,"I like this blanket. I have owned other Sunbeam electric blanket's, but this one has a nice weight and feels softer than the others. I don't notice the wires as much in the blanket. You just can't beat pre-warming the bed before retiring after a long day of slugging in the snow. It warms quickly and gets plenty warm enough for the coldest nights!"
2,A little TOO Fluffy?,"I was afraid to use this in regards to keeping it on a lower elevation table display with my holiday houses, but... if you have a display that is higher up perhaps, your cats won't get into it as easily as mine did. ( Well, we all know that with cats, we have little control over such things!)"
3,Great for Gardening,This book was a good one for people who are working on their house. My friend loved it as she was working on her yard.
3,A Not So Great Season,"I love love love Married...with Children. I think it was one of the most intelligent - humor wise - (in the beginning at least) and most hilarious shows to ever air on US TV. It is vulgar, sexist, chauvinists and totally un-PC and filled with a hilarious and super talented cast. There is just something so delicious and wicked about a family that is so decrepit and dysfunctional and rotten and of course Al Bundy, the eternal loser who is still a winner in our hearts. I have loved all seasons thus far but Season 6 unfortunately is weak. That whole Peggy and Marcy becoming pregnant thing and holding those baby meetings and saluting the baby was annoying. Most of the episodes are about that and it just got old."
5,a great season,"I have all these seasons so far,but, I think this is one of if not the best so far.Peggy is in real life pregnant and much of the season revolves around this and also that Marcy is supposedly pregnant at the same time.I do notice that this season isn't shown on tv as often as others,but anyway this is a very very funny season and easily worth the money.A definite buy."
4,Funny and Raunchy,"The cast members and story lines are funny. However, the treatment of the story often contains raunchy elements and is definitely not suitable for children. The redeeming underlying fact is that the family members really love each other and therefor there is no infidelity."
3,Ridiculous and stupid,I can't stand this series. It's ridiculous and stupid but it's my husband favorite comedy series ever. He loves it and will watch the reruns over and over. He recorded just about all the episodes off the tv onto vcr tapes when they first aired but the tapes are wearing out and we've had to discard some tapes since they were not longer viewable. He can't wait for the next season to be released and keeps asking when it will be. The last one released was in December 06. Isn't it about time for a new season to be released. I don't see it on a release schedule anywere.
5,Great fun,"It goes from damn funny to damn tragic in a heartbeat. I really enjoyed this collection of anonymous confessions. It's an interesting snapshot of our times, our morals and our behaviors. It made me think and giggle at the same time, what could be better?"
2,Careful about that,"I post stuff at Not Proud and I don't like being called, ""pathetic"" as the editorial description here says. There's a fine line between opening a space for people to say what they feel and feeding off them in a a voyeuristic, vampirelike manner.Every person reading Not Proud, could just as easily be on the other end of the microscope.I've always been of two minds about the creators of Not Proud and their intentions. Is it it a sacred space to tell truths, or something that generates porn and sources of amusement? I don't know, really. Due to the site's neutral and simple design, it facilitates confessions, and if the confessor doesn't have cause to believe that they will be ridiculed, confession is healing.Just remember the people whose confessions you read can read this, and the book and anything else to do with this Not Proud. You could be one of them, if you had the courage to say what you really feel."
1,Bad Cable - Broke off in projector,"The ends of these cables are thin copper over a plastic stem. We were using for connection of a DVD player to a projector for a classroom. The cable did not work and then we wiggled the cable and got it to work. Then we pulled out the cable from the projector and the thin piece of copper covering the connector broke off inside of the projector. Took almost an hour to get it out. Save tim, stick to solid copper ended connectors!"
3,Nothing special,"Good cable, heavy - won't tear easy - but it's nothing special. Just using it as an input to the head unit in my pickup."
2,Living in Quebec,Not quite up to Living in Paris..a bit disappointing. It was fine up until most of the design showcases of homes. It would have been more of a treasure had it been stronger on the Province of Quebec and more highlights on all the things in Montreal and Quebec City.
3,Good workout video,"You can get a good work out with this video. It would have been better if they would have shown the different techniques first instead of last and if they would have spent more time jump roping with each new technique. But it is a great video to follow along, learn how to jump rope different style and you will definately work up a good sweat once you finish"
2,"Dump the ""Celebrities""!","Louis Garica's video was ruined by the poseur d-list celebrities. This video is MAD OBNOXIOUS!!!Mr. Garcia is not bad, but the two d-listers were just AWFUL!I can not recommend this and it's probably going into the trash, because I don't even want to re-sell it.May I suggest AeroJump by Michael Olajide. It's MUCH more challenging (not for the weak) and it's just Michael."
2,Didn't think before I bought,"Unfortunately, I cannot give this video a good or bad review. I made the purchase thinking, ""this is going to be easy because I can jump rope"". I actually LIKE to jump rope. However, when I made the purchase, I wasn't thinking that there isn't space in the house to watch the video AND jump rope. Therefore, I had to return it. Good luck to those of you who have purchased it and have had success with it. For those of you thinking about making this purchase, make sure you have space to actually use it."
3,Excellent book,This was a very excellent book and I ordered the other 2 vol.These also were very very good. I have enjoyed them very much.They would be a very good addition to any boyers library.Very good prices also.
5,Great Book.,"This volume is very explicative and not lost any details of his points. All the volumes makes a great help, and even a single powerfull source of information, to anyone who want to make the finest traditional bows, i recomend !"
3,not that great,"wasn't at all what I was looking for, I was hoping for a more helpful book than this on the subject."
1,The author needs to do his research,"I practice patent law, and believe there needs to be a serious reconsideration of intellectual property rights and economic incentives for research in this country.Unfortunately, I cannot take this book seriously, and will return it rather than finish reading it. In reading perhaps 30 pages of the book, I noted quite a number of basic errors or mischaracterizations of patent laws and the basic mechanics of obtaining patents.Perhaps he has some good arguments to make about IP rights. I might even agree with some of them. However, he has either failed to do his legal research properly or he has deliberately mischaracterized patent laws. Either way, his credibility is shot with me."
1,Ill-fated Critique that lacks any real discourse,"Walker's book, We Can't Go Home Again, is a poor attempt to debunk Afrocentrism (more appropriately termed Afrocentricity). The book quickly develops serious flaws. Walker's conscious and purposeful reference to Black people as ""Negroes"" (without offering any context) only exemplifies his frame of reference and places him outside of serious dialogue. He admittedly demonstrates a limited scope of Afrocentricity by focusing on the supposed primacy of Ancient Egypt (Kemet) within Afrocentricity's epistemological framework while not even briefly exploring other main tenets. It appears, as with other attempts, that this critique is only put forth to sensationalize the issue and not to engage in a constructive exploration of what should/could be done about the modern Afrocentric movement. For those wishing to understand the possibilities and limitations Afrocentricity, there are far better texts that this one."
3,Helios Live,"Sounding looser than in the studio, Creed serves up a good mix of his solo work. To my ears however, it sounds a bit uninspired, not a lot of life to the performance, sort of a 'do-the-gig-and-move-on' vibe. Not bad mind you, just not as interesting as I had envisioned it would sound live but certainly worth a listen."
4,Do you believe in Magick?,"This is a one-man show starring Poke Runyon, who calls himself a ""ceremonial magician."" He's an entertaining guy with a touch of Vincent Price to him who describes and demonstrates the special methods and techniques designed to tap into the Ancient Western Wisdom and summon spirits, gods and goddesses from the Other Side. Basically, a day at the Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.There's a lot of paraphernalia involved, and costumes, incantations and ritual. Like most religions, to an outsider it can look like so much mumbo-jumbo. The repeated ""Don't try this at home"" warnings are a nice touch. Since to my knowledge there's nothing else like this anywhere, I'd say if this sort of thing is your thing, you should see this."
1,malarkey,"movie is not only complete malarkey, to be kind, supossed images of conjured spirits appear in a mirror and happen to look and talk directly to camera I'm not a professional on ritual magic but I'm smart enough to know this production was a total and complete falacy. not only was it a complete deception the ""deluxe master mandala map"" was not even included ( for the high price of 15 fiat dollars you get a dvd manufactured in someone's home office omethis ""mandala"" waydeciding factor for purchasing this atrocious lie. while small aspects of these rituals may be accurate their recorded ""invocations"" are beyond laughable to say i felt cheated would be an uderstatement of MAGICAL proportions. . .. ..."
4,"Tough & time consuming, but worth it.","On the kit I purchased, the pattern didn't match up with the directions, making it a bit more complicated. You really have to pay attention while working on this one; otherwise, you'll be lost. It's tough to figure out which yarns constitute which colors, so pay attention to the thread count for each packet; that's the only way to figure it out.Despite all that, the end result is gorgeous, and the seemingly similar-colored threads stand apart from each other, creating intricate detail. This is certainly NOT a kit for beginners, so if you're up for a challenge, this stag is for you."
5,Beat expectations,"I ordered this kit for my grandaughter who loves crafting. I remember doing latch hook projects years ago and thought it was something new and different for her to try. The kit is high quality...beautiful colors, nice size. I can't wait to help her start a new craft. She loves horses and takes riding lessons so this should be right up her alley. Product arrived in a timely fashion and in perfect condition."
1,This latch hook rug is something else,"This latch hook rug is very confusing. The colors on the hook rug do not match the colors of the yarn. You have to follow exactly what's on the chart or your picture won't look like the picture on the box. For the mountain in the background, they have orange instead of blue. Yellow, orange and purple instead of brown and light brown and black for the deer. This is the most ridiculous rug I've ever seen. When I used to do latch hook rugs the colors of the pattern matched the yarn that came with it. Whoever did this, just wanted to make things more nerve rackingly confusing and wanted to boggle your brain."
3,Looks OK done,"This was not a great kit, but it is OK when done. I was disappointed in the yarn quality. A lot of short and too long yarn pieces and the diameter varied greatly. A lot of some colors left over and others ran short on count."
1,order cancelled,"Ordered rugs from Joann, 2 weeks later get an email which said ""your order has been canceled"",no other explanation. Seems like a great business practice to me. The items were still offered for sale. They won't get my business again."
3,Useful but flawed,"The diagrams and orders of battle are very good. Some of the diagrams, including that of the attack on the town, are invaluable. However, if using this as a serious reference, make sure you have a second source. There are a number of disturbing errors. A quote credited to Longstreet was actually by Alexander Porter. The dates on the Mud March are wrong (or perhaps this section is just poorly written). The name of one of the two generals who criticized Burnside in Washington is wrong! These errors throw into serious question the editing and validity of the work."
2,Huge mini hi fi,"I ordered this hifi without checking the measurements. It is described as ""mini"", but it is very big. Fortunately, J&R music was courteous about taking it back and crediting my account, but I was out a lot of money for shipping. To paraphrase my father-in-law's words... Measure twice. Order once."
4,Sony LBT-ZX6,"This is a very good product, especially for somebody with a lot of cassette tapes. Good speakers performance.It was the product I was looking for."
5,Can't beat the quality and the price,"I looked at a lot of other stereo systems befor I bought this one, and I must say that I am very glad that I desided this isthe one to buy, it is great. This stereo has all of the features that I wanted, and not a bad style either, if you want a good stereo at not a bad price this sony is for you!."
5,OUTSTANDING VALUE,"After agonizing for months over which shelf system to purchase, I am quite pleased with this. I wanted something that could play classical, jazz, reggae and Afro-Cuban. This provides good sound and rhythm across the board. It has an equalizer with a jazz setting that does nicely with classical as well.There are specific reggae, salsa & samba settings. Ernesto Lecuono rhumbas sound fine on the latter.The speakers are powerful enough to rock the casbah and maintain sound clarity at the higher volumes. I seldom push it past two thirds of its capability.I'm not an audiophile, merely a music lover. Can't believe how satisfied I am at so low a price and I'm not easily pleased. I wrote this review to save others the months of indecision I experienced."
5,Love Will Go All The Way,"Love Will Go All The Way is the best gospel video that I have ever viewed...the singing, the audience reaction and participation, the band, as well as all musical support were so spiritually charged that it was impossible to even consider doing anything that would distract me from the session for fear that I might miss something...Everytime I play the video it gets my undivided attention. I hope they produce more videos!!!"
1,Promotion Tool,This book is a quick easy read that sheds nothing new or insightful to business people. In my opinion it was nothing more than organized drivel to impress Donald Trump so when his year in the position he won in Trump's company is over he will not have to leave but instead get an offer to stay. It is nothing more than a tool to get a better job in the corporate world; at the expense of my time.
4,A Book of Inspiration,"If you are looking for a book filled with tactics and ideas, this is not it... move along. If you are looking for an inspirational addition to your business collection, then this should be yours. Personally, I loved this book and read it in one sitting. It profiles Mr. Rancic, demonstrating the obstacles he has overturned on his road to success. ""You're Hired"" shows what can be, and motivates one to achieve."
5,Amazing!,This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. I'm a fan of Bill Rancic and even more so now after reading this.
2,Moderate at best,"I don't think this is very useful, a lot of people do what Bill did before the apprentice. And hey a harvard mba does help, no matter what he said that it's practical vs textbook, it's always better to go to harvard than not go there, and not everyone can make it. Real estate is one where one needs experience than an academic degree, but all business don't fall into that type. Bill has some strengths, but you would learn more by watching the tv show than read his book."
3,Lots of hints but most are common sense,I liked Amy's and Carolyn's books better. This was the most autobiographical of the 3 tracing Bill's life through the beginning of his career forward. The tips were common sense from the perpective of a 38 year old IT Manager but may be helpful for those just out of college. I got the impression that Bill thinks very highly of himself (unlike Amy and Carolyn who are more humble or do a better job of hiding their arrogance).
1,"Bill, a sad ending to a good show","Bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know. The show was much better, you should buy that. Kwame is much smater and deserved the job. I can tell that this book is another promotional tool. Don't waste even a cent on this book."
4,Lowepro Filter Pocket,I can't add much more than what's already been said however I wonder why it couldn't have had a zipper closure similar to a memory card pocket.
2,Too Much Padding,"There's a line between safe filters and not being able to fit your filter wallet in your bag. This line was crossed with this product. This thing barely fit in my mailbox. I will not be using it. It's too inexpensive an item to go through returning it or I would. It is way too fat. Also, the plastic windows contain some sort of ""mesh"" on the inside that could rub onthe glass of your filter. Some reviewers said they have used this with no such results. I would be super weary about this when you use coated filters (i.e. HMC, etc). I guess I'll just stick with the plastic boxes that B+W provide. Oh well. If you are looking for something simply to hold your collection in a drawer in your studio, this might work well for you. As for the seller, AvidMax, they did good and shipped my item immediately. I'd buy from them again."
3,Lowepro Filter Pocket,"Another very high quality made product from Lowepro, however the pockets are not large enough to hold the filters in their original plastic cases. I have always liked to keep filters in their original plastic holders for added protection and this case does not allow that. I should have looked closer at the supplied photos. Will keep and use for other small items."
3,Size,"It was smaller than we expected and it hard to see from the far end of the bocce ball court. Otherwise, it is OK."
3,Cheap,"Great idea, but the board is cardboard and I don't expect it to hold up very long. There are similar products out there that are likely higher quality, but the price is higher than this was. It will serve its purpose at least for a while."
4,Great phone/answering machine,"Great system. Phone is clear and easy to use. Answering machine has a lot of nice features and easy to set up. Only drawback -- it does NOT come with a wall mount bracket. The package states it can be mounted on the wall, but doesn't inform you it has to be purchased separately."
5,A Wonderful Story,"This was a wonderful mystery story. Decius Metellus and his servant Hermes are serving in Gaul under Caesar and then a centurion, Titus Vinius, is found dead in a pond. I liked the climax and the story's suspense. This was a really awesome story. Enjoyed it thoroughly."
1,no handle,"The picture clearly shows a handle, and my mistake for not reading fine print that says ""handle sold separately"". But really? Can't really use it with out the handle. Amazon should show the handle as an additional item."
3,Yes . . . but does it work?,"The previous reviews all seem to complain about there being no handle. It is clear stated that no handle comes with this item. There is no mention of it including a handle in the description. Getting past that, I would really like to see a review that discusses how well this item actually works to clean leaves out of a pond (after you buy your handle that is)."
3,Excellent packaging - not bad CD,"It's a good song with track 2 really being the better mix of them all. However, there are better mixes out there that I've heard and I thought one of them was going to be on this cd but unfortunately was not. Honestly, probably not worth the 20 dollars with shipping. Try looking for it off ebay."
5,AN INTRIGUING AND SATISFYING READ,"HOMELANDS is not only a thrilling and well researched adventure story. It is a love story about two extrordinarily sensitive and knowledgable outdoorspeople, and the compassion, courage and cooperative spirit each contributed to this five-month expedition to make it a success. Byron Ricks, who is well-versed in the history and geology of the region, writes with acute attention to the sights, sounds and smells of the Inside Passage. Maren Van Nostrand's whimsical sketches deftly embellish her husband's lyrical text. A MUST read."
3,"Interesting, but not consuming","An interesting book, but I wanted more detail about the writer's daily life while on the sea. I found it frustrating to be brought to the edge of what appeared to be an exciting passage, only to be let-down by a single non-desriptive paragraph. I may have missed the explanation as to why there were no pictures of the trip, or even a reliable map -- also found this frustrating and confusing as I'm not familiar with the area. A better model for how to write and include the reader rather than only document a journey is Alvah Simon's *North to the Night*.All in all, if one is familiar with the area and concerned with the socio-economic and evironmental issues of such an area, they will find this book an interesting read. But, unfortunately, one that will not keep you enthralled nor stay with you long once finished."
5,The essence of sea kayaking.,"There are many ""how to books"" on all aspects of sea kayaking. Byron's book captures the why of this mode of travel. To me it did not matter where the paddle took place but that it re-activated the feelings, the fears, the frustrations, the joy of travels by kayak in wild, almost unpopulated areas. Of walking beaches without human foot print and living day by day with the weather & tides; of seeing how little one needs to live. It is the connection with the past and what has been lost. It is this essence that I hold to and try to take with me in my ""real"" life."
1,deeply flawed,"This model only vaguely resembles a B-25. The top turret has guns each pointing 45 degrees off center rather than in parallel to each other (which looks *really* peculiar), and the cabin and nose more closely resemble a japanese bomber of the same period. I have no idea what these manufacturers were thinking ..."
2,Ditto on the first review,"I bought this for my son, who even though he is twelve, had comments similar to those of the first reviewer."
3,Battery,I bought this as a replacement for a previous battery that was also replaced. So far so good. Hope I don't have to replace this one too.
4,1&2 Samuel NIV Application commentary,In the NIV one finds a good overview and relative perspective concerning 1&2 Samuel. It provides good connection with application to current living. It does not provide an enriching depth concerning word choice and relationship to what may be meant concerning word choice in the original Hebrew. It is very good but wasn't quite what I was looking for concerning a more depth in treatment of the language.
4,Pastor,"I find the NIV Application Commentary layout very helpful, giving both the Original meaning and the Contemporary significance. I have been adding a number of NIV Application Commentaries to my bookshelf and I have not been disappointed with any of them."
5,1 & 2 samuel (NIV Application Commentary),"This is really a very good material, for both seasoned and new Christian as it does gives you enough information to understand the past and relate it to the present and future life applications..."
4,Rock and roll is here to stay.,"Esquerita is best known for being the man who taught Little Richard how to play the piano. After Little Richard became a star, Capitol Records signed Esquerita to a recording contract. He was sort of ""Capitol's answer to Little Richard"". Most of his songs were in the Little Richard vein, although a few of them are closer to Ray Charles in spirit. Unfortunately, all his records were big flops, even though most of them were quite good. Not quite up to Little Richard's level, but almost at the level of (say) a Larry Williams. This CD collects every song Esquerita recorded for Capitol Records. Fans of obscure early rock and roll should check it out."
5,A choice responsible for solely,"Born into a modern Argentine family of three daughters, hermaphrodite has during fifteen years to date been grown as a girl. The recent experimenting with a family friends' bit older teen son has brought about a different experience and feelings, confusing and dividing even own parents with a choice their offspring facing and responsible for solely.A nice intelligent movie on a rarely screened topic is, perhaps, of a much better purely technical quality than DVD a reviewer owns presents."
3,Solid,"Yeah, this is solid, but for one reason Only....Slim Thug.E.S.G. ain't real and is trippin when he thinks he some kind of superstar. Go get some real N#gga sh!t....D.O.W.N. name of tha group...Doing Only Whatz Necessary...Album Southern Slang...those N#@a's real, they spit some dope sh#t, if yo like screw get there double CD"
4,Sunday Morning Review,I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my mom....a huge Statler brothers fan. She absolutely loved it. She said it made her think of old days and happier times.
4,"Beautiful, well crafted, but not without its problems","This passport holder is very well made. The leather is beautiful and has a very soft feel. However, there are two things you should be aware of.First, even though in the product description it states that the fabric inside may not be what is pictured, I was surprised with what I recieved. The material inside my passport holder was plain brown - and while not taking away from the beauty of the product it definitely does not add to it like the fabric in the item description.Second, the size of this passport holder is much larger than the size of a US passport. My passport will fit in any of several pockets, none of which seem to be particularly intended for that purpose.Overall, this is a very nice product. The look and craftsmanship are excellent, but be aware of the above points"
4,An excellent culminating score,"I know that Return of the Jedi may sound like the weakest film in the Star Wars Trilogy, but the same quality of the John Williams score shines as brightly as it does on the previous two films. Of course, we have the classical overtones thorughout, especially evident in the Prokofiev-inflexed ""Parade of the Ewoks,"" the wildly Wagnerian ""Luke and Leia"" and all the action music. However, I find that the two newly-recorded tracks are not a real asset. ""Jedi Rocks"" is a so-called senseless song, but I prefer ""Lapti Nek"" better, and ""Victory Celebration"" is too sreious, compared to the sprightly and jubilant ""Ewok Celebration"" in the original film. Overall, a must-have for any STAR WARS collection, though I would recommend the general collector to start with the first film."
5,Arlo and Pete,I appreciate that this CD came from a library. The condition is excellent!! I've had the 2nd in the set for some years and decided to see if I could find the first part of the concert. I was very happy to find this set in such terrific condition!
5,Classic Arlo and Pete Concert,"This is a perfect example of a quintessential Arlo Guthrie concert from the 80's. Arlo always has a charming, convoluted story (for years it was a variation on Alice's Restaurant), followed by an audience singalong. Pete Seeger adds his own wonderful counterpoint to Arlo in this concert.I originally bought this on vinyl in the 80's, and it is one of my well-worn favorites.The choice of songs is great, and you will find yourself humming them to yourself sometimes, or teaching them to your kids (""Garden Song"", ""Wimoweh"", ""If I Had A Hammer"", etc).I always try to see Arlo in concert whenever he is in the area, in no small part because of this album."
5,Great Folk Disc,"Every fan of Pete or Arlo should have this cd. It's got some great tunes and classic Arlo comedy. There's not a bad song on the two discs. This is my second favorite live recording by these two.My favorite record of theirs is finally available on cd, and you can even buy it at Amazon now. It's called Arlo Guthrie & Pete Seeger Together in Concert. It came out in 1975 and the concert was shown on PBS.So my advice is to buy this one, and if you like it go get the other one too."
5,One of the top three albums I own,"I was actually at one of the 'Precious Friend' Seeger/Guthrie concerts and this album captures their performance well. I'd rather it be a DVD, but I haven't seen one offered. That said, any audio of this performance is well worth the price.Pete Seeger is a great, pragmatic, American Hero - he 'gets what's up' and sings about it loud and clear."
5,PRECIOUS FRIEND,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME GOOD OLD FASHIONED, TOE TAPPING, SING ALONG, (FOLK) MUSIC THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT. IT EVEN HAS A SONG SHEET. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL GOOD AFTER VISITING WITH PETE AND ARLO."
4,Really helps relieve pain.,The rib belt relieves the pain from my rib tip syndrome however the belt creeps up. I'm constantly pulling it down.
5,"A life saver, Great!","Releatively comfortable, as comfortable as you can be with bruised ribs. This belt supports my womans ribs and relieves her pain."
4,Surprised,When all the flu pandimic was in full swing several of my co-workers came down with the flu. I know of one woman who died because she did'nt go to the doctor until it was to late they only gave her a 25% chance of living. I had taken all this product never felt better. So far I have not been sick this year. every year I fight a cold or some kind of sickness. I believe this product boost and supports my imune system. Yes I would recommend to others who are might have a weak imune system.
4,amazing,This oil made my bamboo cutting boards impervious to water. Only problem was about 1/3 of the bottle leaked into the rest of the package. Be careful.
5,fantastic~ for wood,This is a great product to use on your wood cutting board. I also used it on my kitchen spoons from France that I love. The oil goes a long way...just rub in & let it soak into the wood; later remove any left & it is so nourishing for the wood! I love this product!
5,A fine product,Product performs exactly as advertised and does an excellent job of preserving the cutting board and keeping its appearance very acceptable..
5,Better than Mineral Oil,I have a large kitchen island covered with butcher block. I have been using Mineral Oil from my local hardware store. This soaks in so much better. The result looks better too.
4,Boos is not just mineral oil,"It is my information that Boos oil is not just mineral oil; that there is bees wax ""dissolved"" in food grade mineral oil (probably why its thicker), along with ""orange oil"" which gives Boos oil a mild fragrance. I reason that the mineral oil acts as a vehicle to move the bees wax into the wood. All of this provides better protection than just ""drug store"" mineral oil. I understand that bees wax contains ""propolis"", which would suggest to me that bees wax has some anti-bacterial properties. Maybe some high powered science type people can comment on this probability."
3,Strong oder,The Boos board looks very nice after applying the oil but it smells fishy. It's a brand new board that has never been used so the smell had to come from the oil.
4,Works well to protect.,"A good product that needs, in my home, to be applied once every 8 days or so to keep my Maple wood block looking fresh and new looking.It works very well, but seems to lose its protective value in a week or a bit more."
1,WARNING ABOUT THIS OIL,"This oil contains linseed oil which can spontaneously combust. There is specific warnings on the back of the bottle about disposing of oil soaked cloths or paper towels. With so many oil products available for cutting boards that are safe, it makes no sense to buy one with a volatile oil in it that could combust simply by putting a hot pan on the treated cutting board or throwing away applicators that have the oil on them. I would not buy this product."
3,it's ok,"For the money you pay I suppose it's worth it. The good; pretty consistent heating, heats pretty fast, maybe 2 to 3 minutes and you're ready. Comes with free grinder. THE BAD; no directions, took forever to figure how to turn heater element on???? Front face cover that shows the temperature and on/off (that led doesn't work) fell off 1st day of use (won't stay on). I don't believe the temperature adjustment works. 400 degrees seems same as 330. The free grinder is dinky."
3,should top load,it works but with a side loading whip its more difficult to vaporize with it has good temp control and easy reading info
2,"Pretty lame, even for an amateur effort.","These folks had a good idea, but it looks like they spent little effort in executing it. Anyway, I guess they need some slack as they're not film makers or from what I gather, not even aspiring film makers. Hard to watch at the best of times. I hear the money goes to a potentially good cause so it wasn't a waste. Not criticizing, just observing. Sorry guys."
5,the humble forerunner,"This was, IMHO, the defining album of a fledgling musical style to be known as, I hate to say it too, ""light"" jazz. This album seems to rate in the top ten of all of their albums to its owners, genre-independently. If only the spirit of this band and some of their great contemporaries (Lorber, Grover, Sanborn, and many more)could have been nurtured throughout the ""light"" jazz movement, there'd be a whole lot fewer detractors and many more enthusiasts."
3,Fly Girls,"Just the bare facts of the first women's air race. Brief background given of each pilot, little said about the planes or the flying/aviation. Why were all the images tinted pink?"
2,A Fan But Unimpressed,"I have been a big fan of these guys since I first scored a copy of Maize from the college radio station that I DJ'd at. This album left me hungry for more of the old stuff- Maize, their self-titled album, or even El Bitche. This one just doesn't wrap me up like the old stuff does. Sorry guys."
5,Pushmonkey Year of The Monkey,I'm a late commer to this band i just started listening to them about 1 year ago...of chours i had to buy all there music....i've gone so far as to get all the promo music too...since i have gotten everthing i could from the band...i dont have a special album i think is better than the rest...they have become one of my all time FAVORITE BANDS...and always will be....but as far as this album goes...I LOVE IT...Cuda24
3,So-so book,"This is a great book for general content and advice on how to write a contract. Do not expect to take this book and copy the forms and have them be applicable to your business needs today. If I recall correctly, this book has a copyright date of 2001. At that point in time, there was not a heavy contingency of professional photographers shooting digital. The contracts contained within the book are geared towards film and negatives, and proofing books, which are largely becoming obsolete as digital continues to march ahead.Furthermore, the included CD-ROM of forms, do not port over to modern versions of Office suite products. I tried opening the forms in Office XP, Office 2007 and Office 2008 for Mac, and the formatting was largely lost. Check boxes were no longer recognized, and borders were lost.I'd recommend the book if you're looking for advice on what to put into a contract, not something that you can open the documents, make some edits, and be ready to go in 30 minutes."
5,perfect for photographers,"This is a perfect book for photographers, with sample forms, explanations as to how and when they would be used, and a CD with the same forms that can be customized. Very very useful, and excellent purchase."
2,Business and Legal Forms for Photographers (with CD-ROM),"The first thing I noticed is that the CD is 1) outdated and / or 2) is not compatible with Windows Vista. One can open the files, but cannot alter them, and afterall, that is one of the reasons I purchased this product.I looked over the Table of Contents which looked very promising, showing a list of contracts, forms and other info. Each page in the book corresponds to the files on the CD, yet one cannot edit those files even if you save a file onto your hard drive and open it in either Microsoft Excel or Adobe PDF. Now I'm not a computer genius, but, I'm not computer illiterate either, I just dont see what the point is if one is not able to edit those files.If anyone has suggestions, please feel free to respond.Mark"
1,Total Waste of Money,"I bought this because I wanted the forms. The CD is not recognized by MAC OS X, I checked this on both of my computers and 3 drives, So I have wasted more money and will start over."
3,Business & Legal Forms Photographer,I ordered this without really thinking. I thought of how to photograph my ceramic works professionally. I did a wrong choice. So I am not reviewing the book.
1,Really bad,I bought this book and its utter waste of paper and money. There are much better forms available for free to be downloaded from the internet. This book is completely useless for anyone who lives outside USA. I think Americans are smart enough to google the kind of forms they are looking for.
4,Excellent source of information,"The cd provided in the book is easy to use. The formatting is a little weird, but it was easy to work with. The instructions in the book are clear and the book is well organized. It is a great source for our business."
4,Business and Legal Forms for Photographers,"This book is valuable resource for the photographer. It is filled with the most popular forms that photographers need, and an explanation of why you need them. This is not to say there might be some instances when you will need an attonery to draft a special legal form for you. For the most part this should have you covered.The book is geared for the professional or serious amateur. If you are using your skills to make money, you need to have your agreement in writing. It will save you and your customer a lot of hassel in the end."
5,Business and Legal Forms for Photographers,This book is jam packed with ready to use forms for photographers. The forms are on a disk and can be customized to suit individual needs. A MUST HAVE for any photographer who sells photos
4,good 4 way book,"Dry, but useful. I have used it on several students so far.... it seems to help, so long as they have a little patience to understand the concept. Even if they don't, you can make some of the basic exercises into a game and get them to learn something. I haven't made it very far in the book yet, but I'm sure anyone who masters the whole thing would be a kick @$$ drummer by the time they're done."
3,Couldn't get into it,"I expected something different from this. I'll say up front that I'm a novice/hobbyist drummer. Having said that, the exercises here are just painful. I didn't find any particular rhythm to them, it just seemed to treat the drummer like a machine required to play right-hand, left-hand, right-foot, left-foot (assigned to no particular drum or cymbal/HH) at prescribed times. I'm impressed if you can do this, but it really helps me if the exercises sound like something in addition to building up skill."
5,Excellent !,"This book will soon have you moving your limbs in unexpected ways if you practice according to the authors' recommendations. You'll find minimum speeds suggested by the authors; they'll seem wildly fast to you at first, but here's my advice: set your metronome at a low speed, between 40 and 50 beats per sec; practice each excercise for 2 minutes without stopping and increase the tempo by one beat (50,51,52...). Don't skip one single speed. By doing this, it should take you days or even weeks, depending on how much time you put daily, to play an excercise at the suggested tempos. However, once you finish, you'll be amazed at how precise and fast you will have become with the excercise, and most important, you'll notice you can play grooves and fills you couldn't play before (this is how I played some double bass for the first time). I have only been playing for one year and a half; I'm a beginner, but a promising beginner, and I owe a great deal of my progress to this method."
2,Better books out there,"This is a very difficult and outdated book. Even my drum instructor thinks it is too difficult. There are many other more modern books out there that will accomplish the same thing. I think the only classics of the ""old school books"" are Funky Primer, stick control, and syncopation."
5,A Valuable Tool,"I've struggled with coordination of my four limbs, and was clueless about the solution, so I'm hoping this will help me overcome that."
3,A good Internet shopping guide without update,"The purplebook 2005 is a good internet shopping guide which includes a large selection of items available for online sale. It also includes information related to websites that offer to send you goods from online shops that do not deliver internationally as well as charities for those who want to give.It is a well presented reference book. I was disappointed when I realized that I purchased the 2005 version less than one month before the publication of the 2006 edition. The 2005 edition did not provide a free subscription to access the guide's website with the updated information. In others books I purchased through Amazon, each edition had access to some kind of an online update.It may be worth considering a subscription to the site instead of buying the book in case the book is available in a public library."
1,Terrible. Absolutely Useless,"I'm a very fair person, and try to give things a chance, but this book was just absolutely terrible.Examples of the websites they have under clothes:Brooksbrothers.comAbercrombieandFitch.comT-Shirts.comBananaRepublic.comAdding a "".com"" to a popular brand is not very helpful at all. More than half of these website I could have found on my own without using a search engine. There are a few highlights such as Karmaloop.com (although this website is really not that hard to find either), but the brunt of these entries were the figurative surface of the ocean.If you are looking for some cool t-shirts try a search engine and some good sites such as coolhunting.com"
4,Nice - but not as described,Skagen watches are great! I have four myself and given many as gifts. Unfortunately this one is not described adequately since it is actually rose gold not simply stainless steel. If you want traditional gold order model 107XSGG.Skagen Women's Mesh Watch #107XSGG
5,Excellent Book,After checking this book from the library I had to have a copy for myself. It is an excellent book for learning about colored pencil techniques. I highly recommend this book if you are a beginner with colored pencils.
3,"Not a ""How To""","This is a great collection of rough sketches. If you are looking for somie inspiration for pinstriping design, this book is a little window into the mind of a master. Definitely not a how-to.... 3/4's of this book is just sketches. A smaller section in the back with some great photos of finished designs. I bought this book along with John Hannukaine's pinstriping book. Together they make a good beginning package. Go get some excalibur 00's and a can of One Shot & you are ready to stripe!"
5,KILLS,"This record is really something special Not exactly what people expect of jazz not fusion either what is it???? It is real killer MUSIC plain and simple new and exciting still sounds fresh many years later OH and all the players here are great As for Mr. Purrone, IMO one of the all time greats on GUITAR, Tony really can do it all.......PEOPLE NEED to hear TONY PURRONE"
3,"Looks good, but could be thicker metal.","I used these to replace some missing holdbacks on a historical building. Although they work well, the metal is not as thick as the ones that I replaced."
4,"Love it, but would love an off switch","This does work quite well and the level meter is very helpful. This added so much more depth and warmth to male and female vocals. It's also an amazing little tool to use as a pre-amp for your guitars. I haven't had any issues. The only thing I don't like about it is a lack of an on/off switch. You have to unplug it to cut the power. Also, it gets very hot when on... expected but worth mentioning."
2,Not so good,This preamp doesn't impart much tube character to a signal. The presets are kind of harsh and solid state sounding. I had to return this because the Vu meter wasn't working. Maybe whatever caused that also degraded the sound.
2,"Useful, but shoddy construction","I bought this to help the sound of a Shure SM-57 mic. There were some improvements, and it more or less did what I expected of it, though nothing remarkable.However, I recently hooked it up to do some recording and found that it has become a serious noise source. I've never dropped it, just maybe shuffled it around a bit with some other equipment. It *looks* fine, but is now unusable because of the noise. (I traced the noise to the unit by trying different cables and inputs and amps.)Find something more solid."
4,Great preamp for the price...,"I tried this preamp with a guitar and a bass guitar...I did not see much improve with the guitar, maybe a little warmer sound but nothing that you may not reach with some guitar pedals (reverb, chorus...). On the bass it sounded great because it gives you tighter and warmer tones. I still have not test it with vocals."
3,VU pet,"The VU meter stays pegged no matter what I do. It still works and I think I can hear a difference. But, not what I had hoped for."
3,Super Reader,"The Cordelia Chronicles is an adaptation of three of the earlier episodes from the Buffy tv show, written to spotlight Cordelia somewhat more than usual.She has to deal with the existence of a crazy invisible girl who wants to rearrange her looks, something that wants to rearrange her body parts, and someone that wants to remove her live girl status."
5,hi fi way,This was the album that made me love music. I remember buying this album when I was in highschool and then listening to it over and over again. Every song is a classic but standouts are purple sneakers and jewel and bullets. I have so many excellent memories of standing in all ages shows yelling along to all these songs.
1,The Title will confuse you!,"This is not a greatest hits album, although based on other reviewers this collection embraces Sheena Easton's hard to find early b-sides and some rarities, so the proper name should be rarities and b-sides by Sheena Easton, ""but"" Gold Collection, is fair for a Sheena Easton fan, but if you want a Greatest Hits, The World Of Sheena Easton The Singles Collection would do you good, as for the songs included here, they sound awfully like demos, but if you're truly Easton's fan you definitely enjoy this!."
3,Well worth the price,"This beginners book on PhotoShop Elemements is clearly written with many useful examples. Unlike other books on this subject, the writer is a professional photographer concerned with preparing photographs for publication - and less about the casual amateur photographer.I found the book useful and well worth the price."
2,Maybe for others!,"This book was not for me. Elements may be useful for others, but I'm a Photoshop person, so I found this book unappealing."
1,Have not honored their policy,"I returned this in April of 2004, and it is now the end of July of 2004 and they have yet to issue a credit to me. I returned the item exactly as they requested. So BEWARE!!Dianne"
5,Strong start!,"Season 1 of The Buried Life definitely started out strong for the boys and kick started my year. The depth of this show goes far beyond the show's concept. It really hit home for me and promotes a sense change in your life. It's hard to explain, you kind of just have to see it for yourself. These episodes will make you laugh, cry, hope and sometimes, all at the same time. But whatever you do feel, it's definitely something different."
3,Great Show But....,I absolute huge fan of the show but there was hardly any special features and you could totally tell that case wasnt the best made not even the seprate doors for disks but all in all the show is great it is my favorite show ever
2,No subtitles means no fun,"I'm a huge fan of The Buried Life, so I was initially excited to receive this DVD for Christmas. That excitement turned to disappointment when I realized there were no SDH: Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. In fact there are no subtitles whatsoever, nor any foreign language dubs. This may not seem like a big deal to the average viewer, but to the hard of hearing and non English-speaking fans of The Buried Life, it's a major letdown.I gave it a low rating because I didn't even bother to watch the DVD. If you're angered by this review, just imagine having to watch the whole thing on Mute. Judging by the other reviews, there's nothing else wrong with it."
1,WARNING!!!! FIRST PERSON!!!!,"If you don't like first person, you will not enjoy this book, even if you enjoy Barbara Hazard. The previous review is correct. It's a great gothic if you enjoy gothic. I don't. I also don't enjoy ""first person"" writing. Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories are an exception. You get to know all the characters through the eyes of Archie. (If you want to stick with regency era, Joan Wolf also does great first person.) Not in this book. Barbara Hazard has always been a sure read for me. This book so disappointed me I was unable to get past page 10. I went through the book randomly trying to get the book to catch my interest since it's Barbara Hazard, I still couldn't. When I read the last 20 to 30 pages of the book randomly, I'm glad I didn't waste my time. As I said before, I enjoy Barbara Hazard, and if you usually enjoy Barbara Hazard, try the book with the above warnings in your mind. You might enjoy the book, but probably not."
2,It was readable,"I will start off by saying that the book did have some interesting elements and at times can be kind of spooky. I might have given the book 3 stars if it had not been marketed as a romance novel. As an avid reader of romance I expected the relationship between the two characters to be the main focus of the story. The story centered more on the ghosts and the relationship between the two siblings. Furthermore the romance between Kate and Luke wasn't really developed and it happened suddenly. I felt that it should have occurred more slowly and realistically. I also was not satisfied with the ending, it didn't provide a lot of closure in my opinion. Overally, I would say that the book is readable, but not as good as it could have been."
4,These speakers need a quality amp to perform thier best,"I expected these two perform better, they need quite a bit of power two give loud bass but sound ok for the price. this thing is light and has multiple connectors in the back. I decided to purchase new woofers for these boxes and they produce far more sound than before, however I also constructed a set of custom subs for these speakers and the perform well as a sub. Not a loud as an EAW's subwoofer but base equal to them."
4,Martay gets the LOVIN' goin!,"Gimme all your lovin done up by Martay is a new sound to one of the greatest songs ever. I think that this version proves just how good the original is. I beleive a song has to be great for someone else to make a cover of it. Well Done Martay and well done to ""That little ol' band from Texas"""
1,returned,the band is much wider and of a lighter color than it appears online. and i have still not received credit
3,Not Enough Stepping,"This video left me very disappointed. Gilad is a great instructor, but he tends to spend too much time warming up and cooling down. An 8 minute warm up??? Who has time for that? Not to mention the excessive amount of time spent on cool down, stretching, and floor exercises. This is supposed to be a step tape, but you don't really step for very long. On the plus side, the moves are very easy to pick up, not dancy at all. I'd say this tape is at a beginner's level. Intermediates & Advanced: Don't bother."
5,Great Workout!,"This is a great high intensity, low impact workout. It starts out with a step routine performed while simultaneously using weights for different arm toning excercises. The first time I did it, I didn't use the weights so I could focus on learning the steps. I soon realized that the steps were not hard to learn at all. Each segment (Biceps, Shoulders, Forearms, Triceps, and Back) have essentially the same steps. Once you learn them for the first segment, you've got the whole foot routine down. Only the arm movements change in each segment. Once the very intense step segment of the workout is over (and you know you couldn't do one more move!), the toning section begins. He focuses on the legs, butt, and abs. He even includes some excercises that target the calves, which are often neglected. This video works your entire body, well! It is hard to complete at first, but it is very rewarding when you actually do."
5,"If you are a Rachmaninoff lover, this is for you!","I love Rachmaninoff, his Concert No.2 in C is my favorite, but I like listening to anything composed by him. This is a CD that pretty much covers a lot of his work in a nutshell."
4,Staying power through solid composition,Copeland's music is still fresh after almost fifteen years. I recommend this album to anyone with a taste for the nearly frenetic but carefully composed pieces once heard in the CBS series The Equalizer.I think you won't be disappointed.
3,Adventure and History,"When Jonathan Waterman decided to recreate the climb of Duke Abruzzi's climb to Mount St. Elias, he knew he was in for one of the most difficult climbs ever. While most expiditions have their supplies airdropped, Waterman sailed more than a thousand miles with everything that he needed, or so he thought. An adventure story turns quickly into survival. Waterman also gives a great account of the Duke Of Abruzzi's life and his passion of mountain climbing despite his attachment to royalty."
5,A great sound,"""Its just addiction"" is the kind of album you can listen to when you don't want something heavy (White zombie) and you def. don't want to listen to something light (Chicago). It has that kind of beat of a perfect mix of the sound of Izzy Stradlin and Ju ju Hounds and Dire straits. The Vocals are perfect for the sound and Rest of the band compliments the singer nicely with a deep groove sound. If your wanting something that sounds original, this album and ""Elevator Action"" for that action is your definite cup of tea then. In layman's terms, It's intelligent and articulate rock."
4,Authentic Fiedler/Boston Pops...,"The attraction to this disc perhaps more than many other Boston Pops issues is that it follows Arturo(as Toscanini affectionately called him)Fiedler's original program formula. That is to take well known classics (""Greensleeves"", ""Merry Widow"" Waltz ) and not so well known classics(""The Bohemian Girl""Over.)and combine them with familiar ""pop"" tunes,(""Moonglow"", ""Hernando's Hideaway"") for a potpourri of a concert. Though recorded in 1958 as part of RCA's Living Stereo Series, the top notch digital remastering makes for a most inviting listening experience. The type of experience that could convert people to life time appreciaters of classical music. Everything played here comes off professionally polished. Long time pops arranger Richard Hayman's version of ""Hernando's Hideaway"" is absolutely the best I've ever heard! Only the less than 45min. running time by today's standards, prevented me from awarding a 5th. star."
4,Great bag but beware of heat,"This bag is very well designed - it is perfect for the gym locker, with handy compartments and the ventilated top. However, my huge running shoes barely fit in the shoe area (women's size 12.5, men's size 10.5)The only other negative is the frame of my bag warped when left in my hot car all day. I decided to go ahead and replace it for the winter because it is that great a bag, but need to come up with a solution for next summer."
3,"Great bag, CHEAP little zippers","I'm on my second bag. When the zippers started failing on the first bag after a year I was REALLY careful with the second bag by not over stuffing, occasionally spraying the zippers with silicone spray and carefully using the zippers...the big front zipper still failed after a year. However the smaller zippers are still fine.So basically the bag lasts for a year of every other day gym use. I'm too cheap to get another bag so I now use my lifting belt to keep it closed and that does the trick. WHEN the front zippers fail I'll just sew them up and make them into pockets so the bag will last me forever. It's still a good, well designed gym bag even if you are aware the zippers are going to fail if you're a gym rat."
2,Not really worth the money,"I bought this and was a bit disappointed with the way to organize your toiletries. The pouches are too small, and as mentioned by pp the zipper was kind of a pain as it is difficult to go all the way around the bag. It does fit in the locker if that's what you are looking for."
4,Hubby Christmas success,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves taking it to the gym. The different compartments keep clothes and shoes and toiletries separate. Great product!
5,Practical Locker Bag,"Love the practicality of the bags....my shoes, towel, running gear fit in perfectly. The pockets are great to store my wallet, IPOD, magazines...and the bag fits in a locker.....Excellent design!"
4,Really nice bag,"I've been using this Ogio Locker bag for a few weeks now and I really like it. It's well thought out, functional and practical. It looks a bit odd next to the common sports bag but once you slide it into the locker it just makes so much sense. The other bags look silly to me now. I like the compartment for wet swimsuit at the back of the bag though I find the zipper a bit sticky. I also appreciate the vents in the rest of the bag - again, very well thought out. The bag is roomy - always been enough space for my gear and a towel. I also like that there is a brightly colored loop on the top front of the bag - a handy place to keep your lock and impossible to forget. Very nice. I think this bag will last me a long time."
2,"Okay, but could use some tweaks","This bag is nice overall, but I prefer the glo bag, which I also purchased. This bag does not have the room I need for toiletries, and I can't fit enough stuff in it. The handle on top doesn't look very sturdy, and I don't like the way it swings and hits me when I walk with it if I am using the long strap. I prefer backpacks. I also would like it if they put the venting system down where the shoes are instead of at the top of the bag. They also need an easier zipping system, like double zippers. It's kind of awkward. It also really needs a place for a water bottle and small items on the outside of the bag. The big pocket outside is nice for a racquet or something, but a spot for smaller stuff would be great. I am going to give this bag to my husband for Christmas. He uses an old duffle, so this will be an improvement."
3,OGIO Locker Bag,"Great bag, but did not rate it a 5 because (1) there is only a single zipper, rather than a double for the ""side door"" panel,(2)there is no dedicated place for a water bottle."
3,Looks good and is functional but small,"Not a bad product so far. Much better than the bulky bag I used to carry. HOWEVER, it is small and does not provide enough room for all my persoanl clothing, shoes and personal hygeine items.I had to buy an extra shoe travel bag that I attached with a D-ring to the handle. It is working well, but it needs to be about 2 inches taller and the front zipper needs two opening options vs. the one option.Overall so far satisfied. Only have ahad for one month."
2,Pass!,"Just get a normal gym bag! This is too narrow for high top sneakers, too small for multiple shirts, can NEVER fit a basketball in it and is really cumbersome to carry. Most people think I'm transporting drugs to the gym in it, LOL. Again, just get a normal gym bag!"
2,Not for Bigfoot!,"My wife has had one of these for years and loved it. So I ordered one--and returned it immediately. If you have big feet, there's no fitting a pair of sneakers in it. I wear size 12's, and they stuck out about 3 inches when I tried to fit them in. They might go in if I ignored the parcel shelf down the middle and just stuffed them in vertically--but then they take up the whole gym bag. And I'm not talking basketball shoes here, just regular New Balance sneakers. My guess is that if you wear larger than a men's size 9, you'll have trouble. I also echo another reviewer's comment that the main compartment needs a double zipper, it is awkward to try to get the one zipper around the bottom of the bag."
5,The perfect gym bag,"Like most gyms, LA Fitness has tall lockers that you end up shoving your clothes and gym bag into and you can only hope to find what you need in the pile that results. This bag turned out to be the perfect solution. I shove the bag in the locker, open the front and everything I need to get to before and after my workout is right where it should be. Awesome design."
3,Ogio gym locker bag,"I like the bag itself but the problem here is that somewhere on the detail about this product it said that it would fit most or any gym locker which is not true! I think that the description itself is misleading. On the other hand, what would make this bag easier to use is if had to zippers instead of one which makes it difficult to open and close just by the way it is positioned."
4,Mr. O.B.G.,"Great sound,great selection of songs except for 1 glaring omission.Sunshine,Lollipops,And Rainbows on this c.d. is not the original! Liner notes are also a plus."
3,Special Features? Anything?,"This is ""Arthur"" and I like each of the episodes, so I'm giving this three stars. But, overall, this DVD offering is lackluster because it's essentially a copy of the video version. There's no special features and despite the fact that it could hold so much more, there's only three episodes. If you'd rather buy video versions, then stick to it because there's nothing extra for you on the DVD."
4,Very good but not my favorite,"As much as I love the playing of Steven Isserlis, I'm not so convinced about his Schumann interpretations. Perhaps we can blame it on the pianist (it may have turned out better with Stephen Hough).Although, the Schumann performance is a very good one, it just doesn't have the same magic and playfulness as Maria Kliegal & Kristen Merscher's Naxos recording of Schumann/Schubert Arpeggionne etc.I found Isserlis' playing in the first movement of the Concierto a bit strained as pretty much everyone else who plays this work (it must be technically very difficult), and the duets sometimes feel a bit rushed in tempo and lack the lyrical, playfull quality I would expect from these works. I did however recently discover that Mr. Isserlis has recorded the Schumann duos with another pianist: I suppose I'll have to give those a listening.Lz"
5,Gospel rap has meet it's match,"I'm a native Jamaicain, also a chistian. This cd has to be the best mix of both words. These brothers are really talented. They provided great christian beliefs with that an island feel. It made me feel like I was ""back a yard"" while listening to that wonderful island beat, yet still worshiping the lord. 2 thunbs up, 5 stars, an oscar, an emmy, the golden globes........... it really is that good!!!!!!"
2,Cross Pen,"I got what I deserved when I bought this product. For $80 I thought it was going to be amazing, but it turned out to be a piece of plastic with no name plate and a really bad pen. I was so unhappy with this product that I sold it on ebay for ($20) and got a cheap pen holder made by bluestone for ($40) which is twice as good and has a really good pen. The only reason I gave it two stars was because I like the cross company and did not want to make them sound totally bad."
3,Not happy at all,"This book may be OK for beginers, but out of 10 things I tried to look up to figure out how to do, I could only find 2 or 3. A lot of important features of this program are not covered in this book... not even listed in the index."
2,anutha weak Luke video,Let me start off by saying this video is much better than the first.But it still stinks.The best part of it is when that big girl was giving blow jobs that was freaky! But after that it just cooled right off . If u havent seen this one save your cash!
3,Less than Comprehensive Perspective,"The book is a must-read for any community considering investing in a private, for-profit sports facility. Nevertheless, it provides a less than comprehensive perspective. I would recommend reading the book along with Minor League Baseball and Local Economic Development for a wider view of what communities might encounter when making this major, and occassionally unnecessary, investment."
1,What a disappointment,"Wanting to take my game from BB to A and feeling like I had the skillset, but lacked the smarts to do it, I was awaiting my order for this book eagerly. What a let down. Possibly 1) the author doesn't really know VB strategy as he claims, 2) does know it but has no business writing for lack of skill in that area, or 3) the strategy side of volleyball is 2% to the the 98% skills and ability. I have a feeling it's a blend of 1 and 2. The description is effectively a lie: 3 pictures (2 ""no's"", 1 ""yes"") on defensive posture. There are absolutely no drills. No blocking strategies. No ways to id weaknesses, just how to exploit them. About 50 pages of large type. How do I give it no stars?"
1,I wish I could tell you,"I purchased my phone on May 30. Today is July 3, and I still do not have a working phone. When I received my phone, it did not work. I have called Amazon close to 10 times, and everyone I spoke with was very nice, but no one has helped me. I would love to tell you how much I love my phone; unfortunatly, I still do not have a working phone."
5,Great toy,I love this toy because my daughter loves stacking.. She's 16 months and that's her favorite toy. Melissa and Doug toys are a stale in our house. I try to count with her but she's busy stacking. Would definitely buy it again
5,Great toy for a young toddler!,"We loves this toy. I bought it for my son when 15 months old and he loved it and played with it for about 6 months. This toy is great for most 18 month olds and older. He used to for stacking, sorting, counting, learning shapes, and more. This is one of the best $10 toys you will ever find! That said, if your child knows their shapes, colors, and can count to 15 don't bother as once he mastered that he was done with this toy. This thing is pretty durable, the only marks ours had on it was teeth marks from when one of the dogs thought the triangle would make a good chew toy."
5,It's a great educational toy,"I purchased it for my daughter. She has lots of fun with this toy. This is really a worth toy. It provide the knowledge of counting, color and shape. I am very happy."
2,"More we play, less excited about the toy","As I have played with this toy/puzzle over time, I have developed some criticisms:1) All of the shapes fit onto all of the pegs. It would be nice if the center cut-out was the same as the shape and the peg was that shape too. My daughter really likes the puzzle-aspect of toys and she seems to not have as much interest in this one because it is so easy to put the shapes on the pegs.2) There are 3 triangles, 4 squares, and 5 pentagons. The number of objects also corresponds to the number of sides on each object, but there are 2 rectangles (4-sided figure) and 1 circle (no sides) and this doesn't make sense.Sure, my daughter and I can talk about the names of the shapes and the colors. Other than that the toy is not very engaging. It's durable and wooden, but otherwise lacking interest."
3,Sort Board,I bought this for my grandson when he was a bab to teach him about shapes and where to put them. He had a lot of fun with it .
2,How about using the square for number 4?,How about using the square for the number 4 and the pentagon for the number 5? They could also use the circle for number 1 and a crescent or semi-circle for the numbner 2.The worst thing about this toy and their clock is that some of the numbers match the number of sides and some don't.
1,from China and toxic!,"Melissa and Doug toys are laced with China toxins on their paint- and they're manufactured from China! Every time you buy something you're voting for the kind of world you want- if you want toxic laced toys made from cheap toxic crap filling up your child's lungs then buy this. If you want American made (support american jobs!) and not toxic- support Pure Play Kids.com - all wooden toys, unbelievable amount of products, and all toxic free and made in America! Support local! Buy American!"
2,Paint comes off way too easily,"My son got this for Christmas when he was 10 months old and we found out very quickly that the paint comes off soooo easily! He only has 2 teeth but still obviously puts everything in his mouth - well, those 2 little teeth got a significant amount of paint off whereas his other colored wooden toys have a much more durable paint that does not come off even after minutes of gnawing. Also, we have hardwood floors and when he crawls around when a piece in his hand, the paint inevitably comes off and gets rubbed on the floor, staining it with a streak. There are plenty of other similar toys on the market with more durable paint, i.e. the KID-O brand."
5,Bang for the buck,"This is an excellent toy for small children. It can help your child learn colors, learn shapes, learn to count, and learn to sort. When I bought this toy, I hesitated because I thought it was so simple that my daughter would figure it out and then move on to something else. But I was wrong.My daughter enjoys putting the pieces onto the correct pegs, or sometimes putting them on the wrong pegs, then looking at me to see my reaction. She also enjoys setting them up on their sides and knocking them down like dominos. She stacks them like blocks and sorts them on the floor by color. She grabs a container of some kind and fills and dumps. She counts them and identifies their colors.Some other reviewers have raised questions about how some of the shapes correspond to the numbers. I think the circle corresponds to the number one because it has one ""side,"" which is the diameter of the circle. The rectangle has two long sides and two short sides, so it goes with the number two."
2,This fell apart!,"Very disappointed in this toy! One of the pegs came off soon after getting it, and now two are out and missing, making it useless. That just happened in the course of normal use, not from being thrown around or anything. I'll be looking for a different one now-- won't get this one again."
5,Awesome toy and customer service!,"My daughter loves this toy! She's 16 months and is a bit young for the sorting/counting activities, but this toy is awesome for her fine motor control and hand eye coordination. I do expect this toy to grow with her, and Melissa and Doug provide ongoing activities on the underside of the board. Plus, it's attractive and colorful, so I don't mind it being in our living room. :)A note regarding quality: one of our yellow triangles started to split along the wood grain. I called M&D; and they are sending a new piece. Their customer service rep was awesome!This is not a good toy for families that don't regularly clean up toys. There are a bunch of pieces that could easily get lost and they hurt if you step on them."
5,"Fun, Educational, Well Made Wooden Toy.","Another great product from Melissa and Doug. As with all their wooden toys this is extremely well made. It is bright and colourful, and has a number of different educational aspects; Colours, shapes, numbers and also learning to put small objects on a thin shape. I am very impressed with this and although at this age (14 months) my little guy is only really putting the things on randomly I am sure that this will last for quite some time before it loses its appeal for both fun and education. Highly recommended."
5,Great for two year old,"This is a great toy for my two year old daughter, she seems to really enjoy it. It is currently out of the toy rotation (we have toys in baskets and rotate the baskets occasionally in an effort to make things easier to pick up and keep toys fresh and interesting), but she liked it when it was down for her to play with.She is more impressed with the colors than the shapes at this stage, but one of the things I like most about this toy is that it will grow with her for a few years.Sturdily made, bright colors, wipes off with a wet cloth or a gentle cleaner easily enough."
4,Not the most durable but entertaining and educational.,"My 12 month old daughter really likes this toy. she loves taking all the shapes off of it and scattering them around. She likes to pick up with empty stand and chew on the spokes (and the pieces too). One complaint though, the paint ocmes off of the shapes. Some of them are already showing the white underneath the paint. I dont like that too much. but since my daughter only does this when she's teething, I just hide the toy during that time. Its a good toy but the paint durability is poor."
4,Good Quality Wooden Sorter,"Not the most exciting of the Melissa and Doug products, but a good, practical toy for the wee ones."
5,Excellent childs puzzle/toy,"Bought this for my 21 month old daughter. It has a great presentation and is the perfect size. She loves stacking the shapes on the pegs and is starting to understand the whole sorting aspect. This is a great learning toy and I can't wait to keep playing with this with her. Will help build her fine motor skills and work on colors, shapes, and counting."
4,wow!,"great video,you'll watch it again and again.If you like barbwire and extreme wrestling, featuring women (Japan women)you'll love this one. Buy it today!"
4,this book helped me,"This book helped me figure out how to do some things I hadn't thought about before. I liked reading the process the author described. I think my embroidery will not have so many trial runs and errors now, so the savings in fabric and hats and napkins I might have ruined before I read this book made it worthwhile. And the print is easy to read and spiral bound makes it easy to keep open next to the sewing machine and computer."
1,Let me save you 30.00. Place you designs straight.,Although I appreciate the effort that was put into this book most of it is incomprehensible and repetative. Almost the whole book deals with putting your designs on the fabric straight. Well I think most of us can figure that one out without spending 30.00. I read and re-read some paragraphs and still could not figure out what whe was trying to say. I had high hopes for this book and was really unhappy with the lack of any real usable information.
5,Works well!,"I bought the charger and first battery probably about 1 1/2 - 2 years ago. I bought a second battery about a year ago. While one of the batteries (probably the first purchased) seems to not hold a charge as long as it used to, they have both been well worth the money! I'm not sure how I could've gotten 2 batteries that I've been happy with while others seem to have gotten duds (maybe it has to do w/ the charger -- I've only used the Juice charger)...but I would definitely recommend this product."
1,"Juice?! Add a hand crank to your camera, it will work better.","What a COMPLETE waste of time and money. I'd return for a refund, but that would be even more hassle, and I don't have time to mess with it...maybe that's what the manufacturer is counting on. It barely held a charge to begin with (camera would turn off and on, maybe got 7 pictures out of it), then quickly refused to hold a charge at all. I tried 3 different chargers, just to be sure that the charger wasn't bad...nope, it's the duddy battery. Don't waste your time or money. FYI, I've found that in my camera, the KLIK8000 battery holds a charge for much longer than the CRV3 style, and fit just fine."
1,They just don't work,"I am glad that Amazon has such an easy return program, out of three batteries only one works and based on the performance of the other two...Its really to bad that I may have to stick with disposable batteries for my camera."
2,very expensive plate,"its a plate...and thats all it can do. don't buy thinking it might double as a cooking pan.. titanium usually tends to be naturally non stick, and my other snow peak items tend to behave this way. sure wish this acted non stick! it does appear to be titanium and not some sort of anodized aluminum, its is terribly thin and will ping very easily. for the money just opt for a thin bpa free plate instead of this."
1,knife sharpener,"Purchased my knife sharpener Through Amazon and use the product and was unhappy with the product and no avialable sharpening parts. I tried to return and vendor would not accept return because I used it. If it is no good how would I know it is no good unless I used it, I got no satisfaction from Amazon's vendor and I am very upset with Amazon. I ended up buying another sharpener not the Chel's Choice where there is not part's supportChef's Choice 120 Diamond Hone 3-Stage Professional Knife Sharpener, Blackfrom another company. Amazon you suck"
2,Big Hunk - Old Product,"Being an old school guy (born in 1950) I was pleased to find BIG HUNKS could be purchased through Amazon. I purchased 48 in two 24 bar boxes, one box was old product shrink rapped with one box ok. I'm sure Annabelle knows thier unloading out of date product because I purchased 48 ABBA-ZABBA bars in two boxes of 24 two weeks later and the same thing happened again, in one box the peanut butter filing was rancide and the other box was old but ok. Be warned that in my case old stock was unload on me and maybe you too.Burnt in Kansas."
3,Descriptions are in error,"This is a good product, sold at a reasonably attractive price. However, the mediocre star rating points to the errors in Amazon's descriptions.The KSM50POB is a Professional 5, not a Professional 5 Plus. Amazon ships according to the model number, not the description, so if you order this item you'll get the Pro 5, not the Pro 5 Plus.This model comes with a classic (C-shaped) dough hook, not the PowerKnead (spiral-shaped) hook. It also comes with a pouring shield, which was not included in the descriptions.The Professional 5 Plus has a 450 watt motor, whereas the Professional 5's motor is 350 watts (so this description is correct, but it doesn't match the Pro 5 Plus).The customer images I uploaded above show what it says on the box."
4,Pretty good textbook!,I have had three or four other books for the class this text is for and this one is my favorite. The author does a good job explaining the theorems.
1,Read this before you buy!,"This is the outdated version! Don't buy it! I am a Boy Scout who has attained the rank of life and i know that they completely revised the book in 1998, this book is obsolete! Got to your local scout shop and get it, dont buy this one!"
3,Kinda Smallish,Once again a item were reading the item descrition is key. I had alarge area picked out for this item only to be sadden by the actual size. Design is nice and print quality is good but very thin plastic. If it was bigger at leat three time bigger would have been a better value
5,I'm very pleased with this book,The book gives a very good overview of the French military issued handguns. I found it very informative and it would be useful to collectors and historians of French equipment.
3,Shadows of Desire,"Joe Lando was a little out of character, but he did a good job. Sad to see the effects of immorality. Good lessons portrayed in this film"
1,Arthur's DVD not appropriate for little children,"We thought this would be a cute DVD to watch with our 3&4 yr. old. This was clearly designed for MUCH older children. It was filled with negativity and bad behavior. My kids couldn't believe someone would want to be like ""Arthur"". In this DVD at least, Arthur was a jerk so we canceled movie night for the first time."
1,dismay,This book repeats without permission without proper attribution of original material found in my book THE EPSTEINS A FAMILY ALBUM published in London in 1984
1,5 star music--One star release,"The rating is not a reflection of the quality of music--Keith Urban is very, very good. Unfortunately, this release is ""infected"" with the so-called ""copy protection"" software--the stuff that has received such a horrible reputation recently.My suggestion? Wait until the title is re-released without the ""enhanced"" features and *then* buy it!"
5,Powerful book!,"This is a must-read for anyone considering fostering or adopting a child who has been abused or neglected. Attachment disorder is a very real problem, but there is hope for reaching their hearts and helping them heal and grow. This book tells the story of a child who benefited from holding therapy, but by no means touts such therapy as a one-size-fits-all panacea. It is a single family's tale, and it is delivered with the knowledge, understanding, and compassion of someone who has lived through this emotional challenge and emerged whole and intact."
1,Abusive Methods Used by Sex Offender,"Christopher [Hawthorn] Waldmann's name has been removed from the 2nd edition of the book, which is published by the notorious Nancy Thomas. Waldmann is currently on the Colorado Sex Offender list for:""SEXUAL ASSAULT ON A CHILD BY ONE IN A POSITION OF TRUST""[...]It appears that ""Attachment Therapy"" attracts sadists, as well as sex offenders. Most tragically for the children, the parents almost always go along with this torture of their adopted children. Attachment Therapy is classified by some authorities as a ""therapy cult."" Linda Gianforte Mansfield must be a true believer in ""Attachment (Holding) Therapy"" to take full credit for a book that advocates methods that are professionally considered child abuse.For more info: [...]"
1,Work of Fiction Seemingly Masqueraded as Truth,"This book is set up to be read with children. It tells the story of a little boy adopted as an older, hurt child. He is the product of years of abuse and neglect. Angry and destructive, he is closed off from his adoptive parents. Nothing works until he begins holding therapy and begins to heal. The child's emotions are true enough. I do not argue there, but this book is set up as propaganda for those who would have us believe that holding therapy is a panacea for the world's disturbed children."
5,Amazing!!,"One of the most wonderfull disc i've ever listened!!, the delivery was ok; regards from underworld"
5,"two great albums, for the price of one","I bought PDS when it came out many years ago, and then kind of forgot about Joshua, I wasn't even aware when Delilah Blue was released, so when I heard about Vanishing America, it got me looking for what he'd done in the interim. I was shocked when I heard DB did so badly that it was deleted, so when I heard about this collection I ordered it immediately. The first half is PDS, the second DB, with I think two new songs. Now, the two halves are too different to compare, which is probably why DB did so badly. I think its great. Rather than put out another Jessie, or Beautiful..., he put out totally different songs. I would definitely recommend this album, and buy Vanishing America too."
5,Reinvention is good!,"When I'm in a bad mood, I put on Joshua Kadison. I can't help it, his music and lyrics just make me feel GOOD. Mr. Kadison seems to be constantly reinventing himself. PDS was a very ""pop"" collection, where as DB was extremely ""gospel"" and ""jazz"" sounding. I absolutely love THIS CD. It has the best of both of the previous releases, and a couple of new tracks. If you enjoy songs that tell a story, then you will certainly enjoy this collection."
1,tommtna,"I tried two of them out for the first time at a reception. was ready to start playing music and NOTHING. Thank god I still had my old ""livewires"" as a back up. The Speakon connections are cheap and dont really fit right and click normally to amps. I will throw them away."
3,"its OK, not great","i know how to rap cables, and i know how to store them too. these cables have been treated like gods in my house and yet they are already giving issues, with static, when the cable is a bit bent. thats bad wires, not to worry i have experience fixing cables and was able to fix it up. But be warned SOME cables from this brand can become less pleasing after a few days use. Maybe it was bad luck idk. Im just stating a review to all buyers"
5,Refreshing alternative to seeing your drinking problem,"Anyone who has wondered if they have a drinking problem also has probably recoiled at the label that comes with this ""alcoholic"". Carr provides a different way of seeing the entire landscape and ideology of alcohol and drinking in our culture, which is both empowering and liberating. While written for sure from a man's point of view (which he acknowledges) I found it very thought provoking and inspiring, and ultimately effective. 3 days in....feeling good."
3,"A Let down, but good info to ponder on.","Chapter after Chapter, the author leads you to believe you think you will get to learn how to ""control Alcohol"" before the end of the book. However, he does not deliver. Instead the final chapters are filled with information to let you know that even if you wanted to ""control Alcohol"" you really cannot and will need to choose to give it up. The author spends a tremendous amount of time trying to convince you that you should only choose this one option of quitting. Although the author is not to impressed with AA, he came to the same conclusion as AA.I do appreciate the authors time in developing a book that allows the reader to actually have head conversations about the pros and cons to drinking, what it does to the drinker, the drinkers health, the drinkers family, and everyone else around the drinker. For this reason I'm giving it a few stars at least."
2,Not based on sound principles.,"Three people read the volume we purchased and felt that it wasn't worth reading. If these ideas work for someone, wonderful! However, we wouldn't promote them."
2,"Carr promises the earth, the moon and the stars (but of course he cannot deliver)","Once again, Carr's central truth is: To know how the addiction works is to be free of it.Unfortunately this is simply a false dawn. The greater the need for a solution, the more willingly we suspend disbelief and trust in a system that promises an end to our problem. This is not to say the book contains nothing of worth. But Carr's demand for total deference and his insistence on offering a complete cure inevitably prepare us for eventual disappointment.We are all more intelligent than we are capable and awareness of the insanity of addiction never saved anyone from the disease."
1,"The Horror, The Horror","This book provides a valuable--and shocking--window on abortion practice and academic feminist reasoning. It should take its place alongside Magda Denes' In Necessity and Sorrow as a leading exhibit of the macabre, crimson world of American abortion. That was surely not its writer's intention, but the combination of her amoral framework and energetic enthusiasm to present uncloaked her feminist vision of procreative liberty reveals a perverse valuation of human life that will shock and deeply disturb. An ocean of blood runs through the abortion center Simonds approvingly studied. You don't know anything about what abortion actually, truly, is until you've read Simonds' interviewees descriptions of bloodied, dismembered pre-born human beings, and the profound self-delusion of everyone who participates in this slaughter of the innocents."
5,Cheap mold gets the job done.,"I bought this to make truffles for my love interest and they came out wonderfully. I recommend this mold to anyone, assuming the price stays relatively low."
5,HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TO.,"THESE TREES ARE SO WORTH EVERY PENNY. OTHER DEDICATED BONSAI SITES SELL THIS EXACT TREE FOR 2to4 TIMES THIS PRICE, NO JOKING! IF YOU KNOW WHAT THESE TREES USUALLY SELL FOR, THEN THIS PRICE MIGHT SEEM TO GOOD TO BE TRUE. BUY IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED"
4,Nice tree. Outdoor only!,"I looked at a few different trees before ordering this one. Its nice, but its meant for outdoors. I wanted a Bonsai that I could put on a table. I did not see that anywhere in the product description."
1,Wrong Track List -- Not UK Release!,"This release and the track list that Amazon provides is incorrect. I ordered this set for the UNKLE/Moby remix -- which is exclusive to this set, yet is only available on the UK release of this set. For some reason the remix was omitted from the US release.Thanks for the heads up, Amazon!"
5,It one of the best movies of Cinderellla that I've ever seen,I really enjoyed watching this movie and would love to find a copy of this movie someday. I would buy the movie if i could find one for sale. I loved Lesley Ann Warren in this movie and would watch it over and over again.
4,"Proto-Punk/Metal/Goth-KrautProg Oddity, but good","Is that enough '/'s and '-'s for you? Wow, what a strange find. Seems this had a very limited release in germany in 1972 and has only been available as a rare bootleg until now. This Necronomicon (there have been at least two bands to use this name since) hailed from Aachen and played a primitive, doomy amalgam of psychedelic kraut and progressive rock. 'Tips...'(the title translates roughly to 'How to Commit Suicide') is a concept record about a future planetary eco-catastrophe caused by overpopulation. The lyrics are not the only prescient element. The music anticipates aspects of both Heavy Metal and Gothic rock."
5,Very good product. High quality!,This product is really good! 100% as described! I have an American Pitbull and is not safe to take the ball with the hands. This toy definitely solve the problem. Now we play with the ball and my 6 years kid the hole day!the most important is that you keep your hands clean and safe!
5,Best toy ever!,"This is a great toy for dogs who love chasing balls. I have four of them, I keep one in the car, one in the backyard and I always have a spare!"
5,Great toy for the busy dog!,Love how easy this product is to use! My dog loves sprinting after the ball over a longer distance than I can throw. I love this product because I don't have to work as hard!
5,Man's other best friend,"I have a border collie, a golden retreiver and a chocolate lab. We buy about 100 tennis balls a year. This toy is the best invention for fetching obsessed dogs. The best part of this toy is never having to touch the ball!"
5,Another Home Run in Dog Toys !!,I bought this for my best friend since she has a couple of yellow labs and she was looking for an easier way to throw a ball for them to chase. The fact that you do not have to touch the slimy ball once they bring it back is a MAJOR bonus !! I bought her both the regular size and the Jr. Breeze now lets my best friend know when it is time to play with the Chuck It. What a great idea / toy!!
5,Chuckit! ball launcher,Great product!! The dogs and I both love it. I'm glad that I received the lime green color because I can spot it quicker if it gets left in the yard. It helps the dogs get their exercise and doesn't hurt my arm or shoulder. We all get to exercise and that's we need to be doing.
4,Chuckit Review,Purchased the chuckit for my 3 dogs. The lab looooves it. One of the others thinks it's a giant chew toy so we have to keep it out of her reach. :) Would recommend it for any dog that is a fetching machine.
2,ChuckIt ball is not very sturdy,"I was very excited about receiving this toy for my German shorthair pointer (age 9 months) as he loves to retrieve. We usually play with tennis balls but I just can't throw them far enough. So I thought this toy would be great for him. Unfortunately, within 24 hours of receiving the toy, he had broken the ball in half. Just by chewing on it as he brought it back to me. He wasn't even sitting there chewing on it for long periods of time - it was just in the time that he took him to bring the ball back to me, and he would chew up and down on the ball. Well, this ball is very flimsy and did not hold up for very long. A tennis ball would work a lot better!"
3,Too big for us,"I prefer the smaller chuck it... this one is to big for me. I can't get any leverage on it. Probably better for a male. Either the small or this size, I would suggest buying through amazon because it saves you money- and that is always a good thing!"
1,disappointed,I thought i was buying the larger balls and thrower when i purchased the chuck it! ? The thrower and balls to small for labs???
1,chuckit ball,Have bought this item in pet stores and it comes with a hard ball that is useable. The first time I threw the ball the dog bit into it and it popped. Dangerous and useless!!!
3,Great launcher but...,"We have a GSD who has a ton of ball drive. This thing is wonderful to wear her out. It does exactly what it claims to and if you get it to launch just right, that ball will soar quite a distance! HOWEVER....if you are prone to shoulder or back pain/injuries, beware! I have had to get my back adjusted two extra times in the past month because of the Chuck-It and I went a week barely being able to move my arm because of the pain in my shoulder. My chiropractor has told me to not use it anymore because of how screwed up my back gets from trying to really launching the ball. I am sitting here in pain from using this thing over a week ago.Bottom line: 5 star product but not for injury-prone people."
4,Good thrower,Good dog toy. Nice to not have to handle a slimy ball. Handle isn't very comfortable. Next smaller size is easier to handle and throw with. Small kids don't seem to be able to throw with it.
3,chuck it,It is probably just me but I have a hard time throwing this in our yard. We have a giant hill (going up) and the ball keeps hitting the hill sending it back down to the deck!
5,This CD is superb!,"On the strength of this album alone Gordon Lightfoot would deserve greatness. There's only one track on here (Baby It's Alright) which I could do without; all the rest I like more every time I hear them. ""Your Love's Return (Song for Stephen Foster)"" is far and away my favorite, and one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard."
5,Mellifluous melodies,"I've had this CD for almost ten years and it's still one of my favorite albums. This is Gordon Lightfoot's first album with Reprise after five with United Artists(later renamed Liberty)Records. The title track was a big hit and is now a classic. Here he is augmented by Randy Newman, John Sebastian of The Lovin' Spoonful and Van Dyke Parks. This album is almost entirely acoustic with one track, ""Baby It's Allright"" featuring drums. The only track not written by Lightfoot,""Me And Bobby McGee"" became a hit for Janis Joplin. The album as a whole is a great listen with great instrumentation. When you play this album,sit back, close your eyes and enjoy the ride."
5,THE TITLE SONG - JUST THE BEST SONG EVER WRITTEN,YES IT IS AND I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY! GORDON SONGS HAVE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC & LYRICS TO TOUCH YOUR SOUL
5,Great Album!!!,"Gorden Lightfoot is awesome!!! My dad convinced me years ago to buy this album (on cassette tape), and it instantly became my favorite. Since the age of CD's I haven't listened to it much, since it was a tape. However I just bought a car that only had a cassette player and I started listening to it again. Obviosly I listened to it too much since the tape just broke off the reels and its driving me crazy not to be able to listen to it now!!!! Anyways, I'm about to buy it on CD now, and you should too. You won't regrete it."
4,Lightfoot's Breakthrough,"If You Could Read My Mind was originally released in 1970 under the title of Sit Down Young Stranger. The album generated little action as Canadian Gordon Lightfoot's previous albums had. Then in 1971, the hauntingly beautiful ballad ""If You Could Read My Mind"" became a top ten hit, the album was re-released with the new title to capitalize on the popularity of the song. This started a good run of chart success for Mr. Lightfoot. The rest of the album is equally as strong as the title track. ""Minstrel Of The Dawn"" is a great track as is ""Cobwebs & Dust""."
5,Shania--ALWAYS a MUST have,"Is there any other way to rate anything that this beautiful woman sings other than absolutely FANTASTIC? I think not. This CD and all her others are must have items for all Shania fans and even for people who aren't. If you've never heard her before, listen now--I gaurantee you'll fall in love."
3,TOO BORING.... TOO CLASSICAL,"The music and singing are for 5 stars, specially Luciana Serra. Her technique is really great. Her coloratura is perfect and reminds Sutherland's because both had a perfect technique, specially coloratura, but not a particularlly pretty voice. As a reviewer said in other review they don't make singers like those now. What bothers me in this DVD is the stage and costumes as in all other DVD recorded at Schwetzingen, always so classical. They need a Dario Fo or similar to create something different, a new atmosphere as it is happening arround the world. Examples are La Gazetta (Barcelona), all the Mozart series and the Netrebko-Villazon Traviata at Salzburg, many others at the Zurich Opera (Cosi fan tutte, Macbeth, etc), Trovatore, Faust (Alagna-Terfel) and others at Covent Garden, to name a few. Hope someday we may see a different Rossini at Schwetzingen."
5,A Rare Gem,"I have gone through many religious books in my lifetime. But once I had got this book in hand I first and foremost considered myself the most fortunate person in this world. Actually no words can really describe what this book means to me. I never got around to any other religious book thereafter, such is the impact this book had on me. It has the rarest of spiritual knowledge. But Most amazing part is everytime I read it, I unearth something new, and everytime it is as fresh as the first time.This book is not meant for just going through once and keeping aside, for me it is part of my life, or rather it made my life."
1,Didn't work,My hope was to use this for a Logitech I-touch multimedia keyboard with a PS-2 output. The keyboard just flat-out didn't work with this adapter.Don't know why.
1,worthless....,"I should have listened to comment made by ""george hall"", when he said that his laptop did not recognize component using this adapter....well, I HAVE a laptop and this adapter DOES NOT recognize external keyboard plugged into it (keeps asking for driver for USB)...and of course, there is none~!"
1,Useless Device,"NANDO ""AMAZON JUNKY"" explained the issue. In order for this device to work, the keyboard must already support USB (dual PS/2 USB connectors). Why would one need a passive converter for the PS/2 connection? KVM? I don't know. Anyway, this product receives a poor review because the casual buyer (me) desires to use an older PS/2 only keyboard on a USB system. An active converter is required. No where in the product description is this limitation defined, nor are there detailed specifications. I wasted $6 (no big deal) and six weeks to discover I needed a different adapter. The vendor issued me an RMA on the basis that the adapter did not identify itself as a HID and sent me another, which also did not meet my needs. Thanks for good service but no thanks for poor product description and not understanding the issue.BuySabrent SBT-PS2U USB to Dual 2-Port PS/2 Splitter Cable Converterinstead."
2,I was not successful with this product,I attempted to use a pci key board in a usb port but the computer would not recognize it. I do not think the product or the company are to blame though.
1,Did not work. DEAD,This item did not work for me.It was dead on arrival. I threw it in the trash as it was too cheap to deal with returns
2,DID NOT WORK.,After researching whether this item should work or not with my keyboard and computer and finding that all indications show that they were a match I was not successful with any attempt in getting the item to work. I decided not to return the item as the cost of the item was so low it wasn't worth the effort. The item was shipped timely and in good condition by the seller.
2,Pump quit after 4 months.,"Bought the product to help my small pond from freezing over. The pump worked fine until the temperatures hit 27 Deg. F. The pump stopped working during the night, woke up to a frozen pond. Not good if you want a worry free solution to freeze overs."
4,You can tell it's working,"For too many years, I have used a small heater to keep a hole open in my pond in Boston only to find out that it quit working in mid-winter and that I had to rush out to get a new one and pour hot water to start a new hold. The aeration kit is always bubbling so I can tell it's working (unlike the heater). It's been in single digits for the last week and I still have a quite a large opening of water. (More than the heater)."
4,Nice long hose ... Not weather safe,"One of the most important things to know about this pump is that it is not designed to be kept outdoors. It shows it indoors, with the tubing going out to the pond. We were able to set ours up in a rainproof container under our deck, and the hose extended long enough to reach our pond. But it is something to watch when considering this product.I was pleasantly surprised how much air was provided through the included stone. Following the directions, I used the styrofoam ring to hang it halfway into my pond. We haven't hit icy weather yet, but it is clear there is plenty of motion in the water, so I feel safe. I am still running my filter, but have removed the water lilies for the winter. At that point, I had some algae which came loose. However, with both the filter and this, the water is now crystal clear.I will leave it in our pond year round, but will be inserting or gluing some plastic plant life onto the white styrofoam for better ambiance."
2,"Okay product, poor customer service","Product arrived quickly and overall the quality of the pump and the line are above my expectations. However, the included air stone was blocked and did not work correctly. I ended up going to the store and replacing with a new air stone. When I attempted to contact the original seller I was told to contact Amazon, at which my only option was to return the entire item."
1,Get a straw and blow bubbles,"Don't waste your money! Grab a straw and blow your own bubbles in to your pond. This ""product"" worked for about 3 days and stopped. I between figuring out where to send it for a refund we checked the outlet, breaker, checked to see if the line was clogged and finally came to the conclusion that this thing was shot! We thought we had found a great deal since our neighbor had paid $20 more for hers but I guess we got what we paid for. What a waste of money!"
3,Pump works fine,"Pretty quiet. Came on time and works fine. The included airstone seems OK. Still not 100% sure why I needed the float, but I use it. The tubing was plenty long enough."
4,good air pump,"This air pump is good for outdoor use to help keep your fish alive in hot weather when a normal water pump does not supply enough O2 for the fish in small ponds. The instructions are a little vague about using the pump outdoor. Used the company web site and found out that you need to put a plastic bucket or something similar over the pump as it is not waterproof and can't be left out in the rain as shipped. Very good for the price. If you have a very large pond, I would reccomend a larger pump that is water proof and supplies a lot more air, but those cost over $100 and supplies to much air for a small pond like you would buy at Lowes."
2,My Mistake,"My fault; wanted the 2nd Gleam, which I've heard and liked. I didn't like this one very much, surprisingly. Let's be more inventive on CD names, OK?"
3,didn;t like it as much as the other Cd's,"I have the last two discs they released, and the instruments used (chello) added so much to the cd's. These earlier releases weren't as good."
4,Short Album,"I love the Avett Brothers! This is a good album, but I feel their album ""I and Love and You"" is a better, more fulfilling album."
4,Great for beginners,"Buy it before you buy your bike. The book begins with a bunch of info on how to pick a good bike and more importantly, how to pick a good bike shop. If you stick with the sport you will quickly outgrouw this book, but it covers the most important basic skills and even includes advice on racing. A quick read. I finished it on the first day, but it's worth re-reading after you gain more skill, as everything will make more sense.Given that you've read the book you'll learn way faster on the bike than poring over the book. In fact, it's probably a good idea to take this book and some 2x4's out to a grass field with some rolling hills and go for it. And remember: if you're not falling you could be learning much faster."
3,Mountain Bike Book,This is a good book. It has a lot of useful information for a beginner. It is also fairly well written.
2,Mediocre,"This book is a collection of articles from Mountain Bike Magazine dating from the early to mid 1990's. As such, the illustrations depict the ridiculous bikes and outfits that were high fashion at that time (A painful memory for me personally). This gripe aside, the instructional quality of this book is just lackluster. The topics are not organized in a logical manner. The reader must wade through the banal prose of magazine filler to get to any useful tips. There is a dearth of practical illustrations and the instruction is just generally unhelpful. A novice rider might make some use of this book, but for all abilities there are much better instructional resources out there. I would strongly recommend Brian Lopes's book, Mastering Mountain Bike Skills, over this one."
3,Book is okay!,"The book is okay. However, the illustrations could have been a bit better. In addition, the book kinda drags towards the end when the pros give their own tips."
3,Not bad,Has some decent beginner tips. Easy read. Lot of typos throughout the book though. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase.
3,A Serious Charge,An interesting if not great film. A 50's teenager movie with a strong plot line. Anthony Quayle is great and Cliff Richard is Cliff so if you are a Cliff fan you will want to see this movie.
4,Opens Your Eyes and Mind,"I have a friend who's as much into conspiracy theories as I am. When he recommended Murder of Mary Magdalene: Genocide of The Holy Bloodline I knew I had to watch it. It reminded me a lot of The DaVinci code, just as other reviewers here mention. It's truly filled with mystery, intrigue, and a lot of things that make one rethink Biblical history. It was interesting to see some of these historical places and hear a different point of view on what ""truly"" happened to Mary Magdalene. Like any of these conspiracy theories, whether or not they're true isn't the question or answer, they're simply fun and offer the viewer a chance to open and stretch their mind a bit more."
5,heresy or hearsay,"I often wonder when subject matter of this nature is routinely debunked that the debunking comes from some quango set up to maintain the status quo and to keep the masses in the dark. Well power to the people that unearth little snippets of possible truth and previously hidden historical facts. Work like this involves research that costs time and money and this one may be a ""work in progress"" but at least it gets people to think about possible collusion in high places that allows history to be written or rewritten so that it will fit into the church's grand scheme of things rather than what may have actually occurred."
3,"Falls apart, won't work well","This is a heavy duty product that falls apart. The outer black portion has 3 sub components that supposedly snap into place. They don't. They won't hold very well in place. It's well built other than this. But, it makes it pretty maddening."
2,Not worth the money,"The buckles are difficult to release with one hand which makes it impossible to draw camera quickly. The top flap of the bag does not provide enough cushion for the camera. I had to put extra foam pads there to help protect the camera. the protection is also not enough on either side of the bad. I mean it is not enough padding all around. Buy Billingham instead. It is a bit more expensive but great quality, weather proof, most importantly padded!"
3,"Nice bag, cheap insert","I've been looking for a small discrete walk-around bag for a DSLR + 2 zoom lenses and this bag works well for that purpose. Its not rigid like other camera bags and really hugs your body, the waxwear cloth is really nice and water repellent. The flexible insert however is very cheap and totally useless, the compartments are too small to fit any zoom lens and will not fit a camera body either. Also the insert is smaller than the bag so you're left with either buying another insert or leaving your SLR in an unpadded area of the bag. I wish Domke would just make one large insert with a couple of velcro dividers."
4,"Good, but not great","I already have several bags, but I wanted one that would securely hold my 5DmkII with a lens mounted and another lens as an extra.The size is exactly what I was looking for. The construction and durability are great. My only issue with the bag is the partition insert. It's a weird square divided diagonally into 4 sections. If you use tiny kit lenses, this may work for you, but almost all my lenses are L series and are quite bulky, so I'm going to need to figure something else out. I'll probably just line the inside with velcro and use partitions from my other bags to fashion together some other interior setup.I still highly recommend this bag. I would just keep these things in mind when purchasing it."
3,Domke f6,"Good look. Design is not the best as it sits ""floppy"" and no padding except on the bottom of the bag. Shoulder strap is a little funky with the no slip lining. Otherwise it is okay but I'll use my canon backpack or a Crumpler instead.b"
2,Be careful with this bag,"I bought this bag and recently used it to carry my Canon 40D and 70-200mm f4.0 L lens. While going through a cruise ship security, with only the lens in the bag, I picked up the bag after it had been x-rayed and the lens fell out, hit the floor, and cracked the lens barrel--$300 to repair. The bag was latched.I tested the bag with only the lens inside, both loose in the bag in the insert provided. In both cases, when gently just turning the bag around, the lens fell out. So I caution anyone buying/using this bag to keep it full of stuff, and/or be very aware of how you pick it up."
4,Domke F-6,Love the size and feel of this bag. It is very pliable so can stuff a lot into it. It is perfect for carrying my Nikon D90 with 18-105 lens attached as well as a couple of extra lenses. The only thing I don't like is the 4 compartment insert is to tight for my larger lenses. I'm trying to stretch them out so hopefully that helps. Once stretched out it could easlily hold 4 lenses and my camera. I also own an F-2 (love as well) for when I need a larger bag.
3,Unusual Debut,"A lot of people eagerly awaited the first Neil Young album.His work with Buffalo Springfield was never predictable;the same could be said for NEIL YOUNG.Folk meshes with guitars and a girl backup group competes with strings.Neil sounds a trifle uneasy;as if a solo career was a regretable move.There are two instrumentals on this release;something he would never attempt again. The two classics on the album are THE LONER and THE OLD LAUGHING LADY;songs still on Young's setlists today.There's a underlining message of getting back to nature on NEIL YOUNG;a subject close to Neil's heart.Although this is a low key debut,it is by no means unlistenable."
3,Neil's Debut,"Neil Young had recently left Buffalo Springfield prior to the release of his 1968 self titled debut album. The album contains a bit of a carry over from his songs from the band and the songs are hit and miss, but their are flashes of the brilliance he would show throughout most of his career. The album opens with a Jack Nietzsche instrumental, ""The Emperor Of Wyoming"" but then moves into the superb ""The Loner"". The song portrays the sense of isolation and despair that would tinge many of his future work. ""The Old Laughing Lady"", ""What Did You Do To My Life"" and ""Here We Are in The Years"" are other standout tracks. The album is a fine debut for an artist who would take many twists and turns through a storied career."
4,Pleasing But Tame Except For...,"Neil Young's first solo album sounds polished and even slightly precious--which makes it the most atypical in his entire career, with the possible exception of ""Harvest"". As noted, it is basically an extension of his work with the Springfield, with the low key acoustic ballads up front and center. ""The Loner"" is the only break in this and has since become a concert standard. That song, along with ""The Old Laughing Lady"" are the two highlights of the album and dutifully appear on ""Decade""; however, the album's other main centerpiece is its final cut ""Last Trip To Tulsa""--a long, meditative lyric which subverts the wide-eyed romanticism of what came before and that as ever reveals him as Mr.Quirky. Rust on!"
3,A characteristically shaky start,"After leaving Buffalo Springfield, Neil Young set off to establish himself as a solo artist. His first effort found him working again with Jack Nitzche, who had been present for some of the Buffalo Springfield efforts, and ended up choosing to work with Young over the (at the time) more obviously commercially viable Stephen Stills. The result is an uneven offering by an artist whose career would be defined as uneven. Young sounds uncertain about the material he is presenting, plus the production is very slick and rehearsed (something noticeably different from the subsequent albums Young would offer.)Overall, this is not a failure of a record (Last Trip to Tulsa and The Loner assure this album its proper place in the Neil Young lexicon.) It is simply a record offered by a young man trying to find his voice in an uncertain time with a new type of sound that may have been a hard sell."
4,Good not Great.,"This album has some good songs on it, while others are not his best work. Even when he is not at his best, he is better than most of his generation."
3,Different than I thought it'd be,"Now in 2009 after hearing so much from Neil, here's his first baby, with David Briggs at the wheel going back 40 years. Ruunning aroound the ship with your life jacket on, here comes the all emcompassing strings and poly phoonic textures. watered down to make it do somethhng. I can't find the edge. Got caught on Spring Break.It definitely weres thewrong pants. Seems like the muffled flaume waits on the cue. The ol laughin lady is rally screaming her balls off........Whens It gonna start?"
3,ES SOLO EL COMIENZO................,"ALBUM DEBUT EN SOLITARIO, AUN CON OLOR A BUFALO, NEIL NOS OFRECE UN PUÑADO DE CANCIONES DISIMILES, ALGUNAS MUY BUENAS, OTRAS NO TANTO...PERO YA DANDO PISTAS CERTERAS ACERCA DE SU CAMINO....QUIZAS LA CANCION MAS CUADRADA, ""THE LONER"", PINTO COMO CLASICO OCULTANDO OTRAS GEMAS MAS OSCURAS PERO TAL VEZ MAS VALIOSAS......ES NADA MAS Y NADA MENOS QUE LA PRIMER PLACA DE UNO DE LOS ARTISTAS MAS VALIOSOS E INTERESANTES DE NUESTRA EPOCA, Y ESTO YA ES DECIR MUCHO!!!!!!!!!"
4,Life of Elmer Clifton,"""Delighted to read ""Woman in the Water"", especially the insights into the life of Elmer Clifton .While the aforementioned writing is much appreciated one would like to prevail upon Ms Clifton to author a definitive book of her father as his is a story that should be chronciled""Chris Collier"
4,Thanks Dorinda !,"WOMAN IN THE WATER is a poetic book, filled with personal memories of Dorinda Clifton. Dorinda is Elmer Clifton's daughter. Her father worked as a director with David Wark Griffith in the beginning of the 20th century. He was once famous, directing a big success in the twenties, DOWN TO THE SEA WITH SHIPS. He directed comedies played by Dorothy Gish, and disappeared in the thirties in Hollywood Powerty Row,until he was rehabilitated by Ida Lupino in the late thirties. Often depicted as a ""Jack London"" movie director, his career is still very mysterious, and these pages help to lift the veil. Thanks Dorinda, for this nice book which brings back your past and how it is alive within you, in a very rich illustrated way !."
5,Lowepro SlipLock Pouch 30 (Black),"Purchased these Sliplock pouches (#30) to go with the lowe pro system ( I have 2 back packs for my Nikon camera gear - a Slingshot 100AW, and the CompuTrekker AW. These pouches are constructed of durable materials, and attach very securely to the backpacks. They have an additional drawstring closure system under the flap that provides water resistance and addition safety for your equipment. It adds to the capacity of the backpacks, without increasing the overall size by much. Great system, and a total 10 out of 10 to Lowepro on their design, system, and construction."
4,Added capacity...,"I have a LowePro Slingshot AW100 sling pack for my Nikon DSLR. Works great, but now and then I wish it had just a little more capacity, for carrying a light snack, cell phone, etc. This pouch, which attaches via the SlipLock system to the SlingShot, adds a little extra carrying room without adding too much bulk. It's as well made as other LowePro products. Works for me."
5,Nice product,"I bought this as an add on to my Lowepro system. I use it as a ""purse"" to hold keys, cash etc. It is easily removable and has it's own shoulder strap, so I can use as a shoulder bag when going out to dinner (and not taking my camera). I travel a fair amount, so having to pack one less thing is great."
3,Good size but hard to keep it closed,"It has a good quality, enough space for a flash or ""point & shot"" camera, cell phone or things you may need at hand and works very well with the slingshoot 200. The cons: the cover or lid that closes the Pouch 30 only has a little velcro to hold it closed so sometimes it's hard to keep it that way."
4,Great quality,"Use this on my Lowepro belt and love it,, its very durable and has a strong velcro latch system to attach it to anything,"
5,Perky Turkey! This album rocks!,"This album is a great way to get a taste for many turkish artists. Sezen Aksu's tracks are my favorite, but they are all good. If you like modern Turkish music you need this album. Also be sure to check out Mustafa Sandal and Tarkan."
3,Good group many haven't heard!,"Saw this group open for Jimmey Buffett, who appears on the CD's ""Gulf Coast Highway"". Good group of women singling upbeat and rockin' Cajun songs along with a few ballads."
3,Not for telephoto lenses,"I bought this lens case after seeing other reviews that it would snugly fit my 55-250mm lens. I didn't expect for the snug fit to be the height. By taking out the padded disc in the bottom, the case just barely zip over my lens. The case is padded well, constructed well, but it is definitely for shorter lenses."
3,No dimension indicated by Amazon,"This is a good lens case, however, I assumed wrongly that it would fit an Olympus 70-300 lens based on the picture showing a lens along side the case. Amazon did not furnish the dimensions for the case. This case is less than five inches deep on the inside."
4,Charming,"Although vocally not as strong as previous Charity Hope Valentine's and of course no one can or should compare Christina Applegate to Gwen Verdon, Christina exudes charm throughout this recording. David Hare is wonderful and the supporting cast does a fine job of keeping the charm and integrity of this musical intact. I would loved to have seen it live. I completely enjoyed myself listening to this cd and will enjoy it several times more."
2,awful Charty,"What a disappointment this was.I was tempedto buy the original film soundtrack but thought a more up to date recording would be better. Hw wrong I was. The singers were dreadful, and the trackThe Rhythm of Life"" was pathetic compared to Sammy Davis's performance. This CD will go in the rubbish bin."
3,Movie-Style Popcorn,"Product used in carnival-type popper. Nice to have everything self-contained. However, so many kernels remain unpopped, you can watch them fly out of popper. Product is very salty. But if you're looking for real movie popcorn, this is it."
1,Another Victum !!!,"I didn't think I would be STRUCK by the $24 popcorn portion. I got a single bag just like these other reviewers. I contacted MALOHEY""S and found that this problem is AMAZON's !!!!"
1,Where is the rest?!?!?,I ordered this popcorn pack which was advertised as a case of 24 4oz packs and only received 1 4oz pack. I want the rest or my money back!
5,Excellent,"This product is great, I am so glad we found it here. We used it in our Presto stirring popper and get a FULL bowl every time. IT is so good right out of the popper in fact that we don't have to do anything to it. My daughter lives to put Nacho Cheese flavoring on her popcorn and since using this she hasn't added any at all. Just cut the top, dump in, even out and pop. Super easy!"
1,Received 1 4oz pack,This review is not for the product itself but for the order fulfillment. Amazon really needs to correct the fulfillment on this product. I also ordered the 24 pack and received a single 4 oz packet.
1,so bad its sad,i'm not sure when this was released but Richard Pryor looks like he was so sickly while making this film. it was so sad to see him in this state and so not funny. and i'm so sick of the 'one note' acting Gene Widler does in this and most of his movies. this persona thats the same that he does in most of his movies just isnt funny to me. maybe you have to be having seen these movies when they first came out but didnt laugh once and at this writing there are 62 used copies of this dvd and after this review writing i'm addin mine to the lot and hope i get a penny for it!
1,Another Pryor and Wilder comedy,I got this movie in a three pack with other Pryror and Wilder movies. Needless to say this is the worst of the bunch. This movie is not really all that funny and is a bit confusing. I dont recommend this movie to anyone who wants too see a comedy. Stir Crazy or Hear No Evil See No Evil is a much better route.
1,Pryor and Wilder's Sad Farewell,"From the moment they joined forces in ""Silver Streak"" (1976), Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder were a match made in comedy heaven - followed by entertaining vehicles such as ""Stir Crazy"" (1980) and ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" (1989). Unfortunately, ""Another You"" proved one film too many. The Wilder-Pryor chemistry was offset by the latter's ill health in this troubled 1991 production - evoking sadness instead of laughter. Pryor should have been in a hospital rather than a soundstage and Wilder's misplaced manic energy cannot carry the load. An ignoble end to the team's movie career."
5,A funny film!,"This film was the most recent for both its stars Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. They did three other films together,1976's SILVER STREAK with Jill Clayburgh,1980's STIR CRAZY and 1989's SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL. In this film Pryor is a conman who befriends Wilder. Wilder's character does a great deal of lying(he plays a dual role). Great support from Stephen Lang and Mercedes Ruehl. Ruehl is Elaine,the wife of Wilder's character. Memorable scenes include Wilder's character being scared by Frankenstein in a haunted mansion,also faking a corpse at a funeral(he thanks those who attended). Vanessa Williams is Gloria,who Pryor's character takes romantic interest in. In the final scene,Pryor,Wilder,Ruehl and Williams are on vacation in Hawaii. Pryor and Wilder have a picture taken with them both holding a sign that reads ""Partners Forever"". Great film!"
5,THERE IS NO ONE LIKE RICHARD PRYOR.,THIS WAS ONE OF MY VERY FIRST FAVORITE MIOVIES. GOD THIS WAS VERY HARD TO FIND. SO SO GLAD YOU HAD IT. LOVE YOU SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH FOR IT. THANKS
4,Good movies,"This is a funny movie!!!! I bought it because I like the two main actors in the movie. I've never seen it till I added it to my collection of dvd's. It is a movie about George, who try's to live his life with out lies. Eddie's probation officer tells him he need's to spend time with George for community service. A few people think George is a man named Gabe. They try to give him a lot of money and a big house to live in. Along with a wife, who Gabe left five months ago. Eddie convinces George to play along and the lie's get bigger and funnier. In the end it was all a trick so Gabe's partner can make people think Gabe was back and kill him so he can get all of the money and own the business. But this being a funny movie you know George gets away with dying."
1,Great but totally unreliable.,"These are excellent devices when they work. However, the probes are very sensitive. You can expect the probe to fail after you have used it less than six times. I have some experience: I love the device, and am now onto my 5th probe. It's not good enough given the technology is really quite simple..."
5,Wing Ding,Col. Carlson told his story without a lot of hype. He makes one feel like they are there. It is a pleasure that I had the chance to serve in the Air Force with such men who gave so much. We of that War are leaving at a fast rate. Such great stories are all that will be left too soon.
2,"Nice case, doesn't fit","This is a well made bag. However, regardless of what the websites recommend, the Canon EF 16-35 F2.8L II does NOT fit inside. The lens is too long for this case."
4,Size makes a difference,"Before I was aware of the optional size cases, I wrote a review of the Lowepro Beltpack which was critical of the overal camera case. Using the properly sized cases makes all the difference in the functionality of the Lowepro beltpack. My only suggestion to Lowepro would be to sell the beltpack as a system, allowing the consumer to choose the lens cases needed. I now have two new tall lens cases which I will probably never use."
2,"Big, simple, ugly - not for Nikon 18-200","For what I paid ($18.55 current price) I should have gotten way more. Like at least two of these, maybe three. I looked at the size chart on Lowepro's site and it suggested this for my Nikon 18-200. Unfortunately, the case is way too big for it. I was hoping it would be somewhat of a secure fit, but no - my big expensive lens bounces around inside this thing - even with the hood on it. Consequently, this case is HUGE. Annoyingly so.The materials used on this case feel very cheap. Extremely cheap, actually. The zipper isn't smooth at all.It does have a belt clip. I'd have to be in a pretty miserable situation to go out in public with this thing strapped to my hip, but hey, it's there if you have to have it."
3,takes me back,"I bought this cause I couldn't for the life of me remember how it ended... I found out why too. It really don't end it just kinda drops the story after a dog show like they had already planned for the second movie, but were shocked when they weren't green-lit. Anyways its an OK movie at best, good times 'cause I grew up watching it, but I would be out of my mind to think any kid today will sit through such a film. Plus its never gonna get dropped on DVD. So skip this if you can."
4,PLEASE!,"Please Please PLEASE bring this to DVD.I was excited to see Garbage Pail Kids on DVD...but I want My Pet Monster!For a ""straight to video"" release...this was/is a pretty good one and is filled with childhood memories. I beg of you...put this one on of them newfangled shiny discs!!!"
1,My Pet Monster review,"You think this film would be about having a pet monster,not have a boy turn into a pet monster.So even the set-up is flawed. The Monster in the film looks nothing like the toy. It looks like Rainbow Brite's poop. Everything in this movie is lazy:the story,the writing & the monster. It also focus more on the dog show plot then the kid. There are also homosexual overtones between the 2 bullies. I mainly dislike how everyone mistakes the monster for a dog. A DOG for crying out load. The villians are morons. The ending is too dark for little kids and also pointless. Overall,Don't buy and/or rent it ever. I give this tape a 1 out of 10."
2,Not too well written.,"Some sheet music is just better written than others. If you have a singer this is fine, but if you're just playing piano the music is kind of sparse. I think it needs a little more."
2,Disappointingly out-of-date,"Very simplified introduction to financial basics for beginners, but needs updating---no mention of Roth IRAs, new tax laws, etc. Might be a good book for teenagers to start with!"
3,Lady ga ga wig,The wig is what you pay for the price. IT is thin and the hair falls out and gets tangled easily. It does the job for one night of dress up. If you have dark hair get a skull cap as it will show through as it is so thin
5,Rolie Polie Olie!,"Fist, our house has a few Rolie Polie Olie fans so we couldn't really go wrong on content of this dvd. That said, lets go on. The stories were a good mix, the dvd a good length and was in excellent condition. I'm not certain if it was the dvd or our player (but I'm leaning towards the dvd as our player doesn't do this on all dvd's) but it seemed to have FastPlay like some Disney Dvds do. It wasn't advertised on the package or dvd but it was a nice plus to find while watching it."
3,starting a business,"They have a very inspiring story, but I wish they had given more details on the business of greeting card. Perhaps more of a step by step way to start a business."
4,A feel good story about unlikely business success.,"Susan's story about Blue Mountain is a great read. It starts with her shocking discovery of Hallmark copying Blue Mountain cards.Then it goes back into the past about how they got started. Susan's style and short chapters keep the flow. Chapters go into details of challenges they faced to start their business and challenges when their business grew.Many chapters talk about their lawsuit against Hallmark. These chapters talk about the toll on them while fighting a large company.In the end there are some stories about their life.Overall a good read. I had always liked BlueMountain.com, but after reading this book (quoting Paul Harvey) now I know the rest of the story."
2,Teaching English abroad,Elementary information. You can find more complete information on internet sites. This book is not worth buying.
2,"Once over lightly,,,,","The author sounds like a pleasant fellow, but his presentation of his adventures as a teacher of English abroad is rather superficial, a once-over-lightly recounting of his experiences, and not particularly well written. For someone thinking of teaching English abroad, as I am, I think it would be practically useless."
4,Worth the money,"I came to Japan this month and bought this book, and it turns out it has helped save me some headaches, specifically, my apartment was poorly furnished, and far from my school. If not for the book I might have accepted 'what you see is what you get' and said nothing. Instead, I told my employer I was not happy, and ended up getting the apartment furnished to my liking and better hours to facilitate my commute time. Complaining immediately seemed to make a difference. I don't know what the previous review was upset about, there is a difference between wanting to make a buck and wanting to avoid being exploited. Maybe the reviewer would have been happy as a Red Guard in China, there anyone who 'made a buck' was punished. THe only problem with the book is it could be longer, but has enough valuable information that it's money well spent."
2,"Very basic, and very short!","This book did contain some useful information from a guy who has obviously taught overseas. However, it was so very brief...I read it in about an hour. It seemed like he wrote it in one sitting, just like I read it in one sitting. It would seem he could've provided some additional research or information. Instead, it seemed like he talked to a couple friends and then wrote it. Again, there is some useful information here, but I would expect more for the money."
2,McCain is a Republican,"And he (McCain) supported George W.anker Bush that is enough for me to give it a negative review - ""We need to go after the people that attacked us"" - Hillary Rodham Clinton in Singapore (We were not attacked by Iraqi's or Afghans) - Iraq and Afghanistan did not attack the United States and the US Military INVADED those 2 countries ILLEGALLY by orders from Bush on FALSE INTELLIGENCE, just as well as they did in Vietnam and that is why the US LOST the Vietnam war. The hijackers at least 13 of them were from Saudi Arabia, they have a case now where soldiers killed four Iraqis in a canal because they had weapons at the house they were stationed at and they are charging the soldiers 'that the Army trained to kill' with murder, it's outrageous."
2,mini bio for John McCain,"This movie was a very short made for cable movie, quick overview of what happened to John McCain during his tour in Vietnam. I am sure if the movie was longer it would have more details of John McCains experiences, this movie is more like an appetizer, makes you want to research more about the POW experience. The movie 'Hanoi Hilton' is much more detailed and shows the hardship these pilots had to endure."
1,reader beware,"Reader Beware! As of December 13, 2004, the author of this book, Fr. Roger Haight has been forbidden to teach or present himself as a Catholic Theologian. This book has been condemed by the church for teaching doctornal error regarding Christ and redemption. The condemntation of this book and its auther came from Cardinal Ratzinger with approval of its condemnation by the pope on Dec 13, 2004."
4,Christology,"This primer was written by a Jesuit scholar who was sanctioned for his work because he plumbed the depths of the topic and didn't stay close to the traditional lines of thought. Written systematically with clear bullet points, this is a thorough discussion of post modern Christology."
3,"Warm, Plush, Weird Material","I am happy with the thickness of this comforter. It's thick, but pretty airy and should be quite warm despite it's fairly light weight. The price for this item was reasonable and I'd likely purchase it again if I were looking for another comforter to be covered w/a duvet.The one thing I don't like about this comforter is the strange, plasticy material the outside is made of. While I have covered it with a high threadcount duvet and it is comfortable against my body, it is stiff and crunches. I've never seen anything like this -- like it's made of the same material as the outside of a pamper. When moving in my bed, it almost sounds like (and feels like to a degree) I have the inside comforter covered with plastic sheeting. I've only slept with it for one night though, so maybe it softenes a bit with wear? Does plastic soften? Still, for the price, I'm happy with this purchase."
4,"Charles Bernstein`s! Excessive Force""-great soundtrack","Charles Bernstein is an excellent film composer who does not have many works released-try A Nightmare on Elm Street to hear an unusual horror soundtrack-or Deadly Friend, and April Fool`s Day for similar experimental electronic styles of music(although both latter albums are very hard to find-as is his older works). I hope that more of Charles Bernstein`s works are released as many soundtrack listeners are missing out on something special. I look foward to more of his work. Also try Keith Emerson`s soundtrack/score work for an experimental style of film music -(Nighthawks and Murderock being similar to Charles`work!)."
4,Noises Off in a Gay Bathhouse,"A well crafted, door-slamming comedy ala 'Noises Off' with a wonderful cast. Rita Moreno playing a no-talent bathhouse singer gives the performance of her lifetime (we all know how talented she really is, so seeing her 'off' is a lot of fun). Treat Williams is delicious as the soprano detective. Jack Weston, Paul B. Price, F. Murray Abraham, Kay Ballard and Jerry Stiller add their spices to this wonderful ensemble. It makes you wish that the days of the Continental Baths would come back'at least the wonderfully tacky shows at poolside!"
5,"A Real ""Treat"" All Around!","I'll leave the descriptions of the main actors to others and they are highly accurate in describing the hilarity of their performances, but I noticed they left out one of the funniest of all. Treat Williams was a young actor fresh off broadway in this very play when he made his movie debut in this farcical slice of bathhouse life. His performance is key to much of the laugh out loud guffaws throughout this romp, all the while doing a falsetto voice that belies his all american macho detective appearance. And it works!!! Only in this movie could all these sterotypes have paraded about in such wanton camp and still steal your heart. Kudos to all involved. Someone suggested a movie night with towells et al. I suggest a double feature with togas and towells in hand. This superb comedy (Rita Moreno won the Tony here) and A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum. Two farces predating Mel Brooks by several years but delivering the same belly laughs."
4,"Maybe a little dated, but hilarious","This movie is often overlooked, probably because of the location and characters (gay bathhouse, gay men, and both are treated postively or at least neutrally), but in the more enlightened 90's, it's a shame it hasn't been widely rediscovered. Garbageman Proklov (Weston) fleeing from his Mafioso-wannabee brother-in-law, gets in a NYC cab and tells the driver to take him to the last place he'd be found - which ends up being the gay bathhouse The Ritz. Lots of stars in the supporting cast, Rita Moreno (who is outstanding), F. Murray Abraham (ditto), and Treat Williams (ditto). Look for John Ratzinger (Cliff from Cheers) in a small role. The ""R"" rating is a throwback to earlier times, if it were produced now, it *might* get a ""PG-13"" rating."
2,"Good Performance, Bad Print","I originally purchased this video with the idea I was going to show it at a party we were giving. After receiving it and reviewing it we decided we had to abandon that idea and show some other video. The print quality was just too poor to view particularly on a large screen monitor. It was grainy, faded, and obvious taken from a much used dirty film. Hopefully, there is a better print of this classic around somewhere."
3,Disappointing because...,"Having enjoyed the dynamite, outrageously funny performance by Rosie Perez that ended Act 1 in the recent off-Broadway revival of THE RITZ, I purchased the original movie version. Although true to McNally's very funny script, the movie version of this farce does not include the lengthy musical number for which I bought the DVD. Disappointing."
4,Funny DVD,Ha ha ha. This movie was also a Broadway play. As funny today as when it was originally released in 1976.
1,Sad and Sick,"This video has it's moments. Basically, sleaze master Luke ""Skyywalker"" Campbell takes his Cameras to Cancun to take shots of (mostly) attractive young ladies showing off their.. er..""pulchritude"". Cedric the Entertainer also comes along (breifly) for the ride. For the most part, the girls look good, while a few (especially the sister who ""performs"" with Luke's friend on stage for $1,000) look nasty. But things really get disturbing at times. For example, it's clear in some parts that these girls who are performing ""acts"" on these guys in public are doing so against their will in a few scenes while surrounded by crowds of fellas. This gives the viewer a creepy feeling and makes you feel like scum after watching it. It's also disturbing to see the guys dousing the girls with their drinks while they show off thier ""ample charms."" This goes past entertainment and into the realm of the sad and sick. No mas, no mas. Strictly for the ""raincoat in the sunshine"" crowd."
5,Track Listings,"Persian vocals with flamenco guitarInstrumental versions of the songs found on Amir's vocal CD ""Scent of Love"".1 Scent of Love2 Memories3 Silver Night4 Roses5 Time with You6 You've Captured My Heart7 For My Sweetheart8 Loving You"
3,You Only Need To Watch It Once!,"If you haven't looked at a jump rope since recess in the third grade, watch this video. The instruction is basic and it is enough to get you going but I'm afraid you only need to watch it once because it is that basic. And per the previous review, it is not really a work out video. Once you master jumping rope, all you need to do is put on your favorite music and jump. You don't need a video."
3,it was ok if you need an ultrafix,"my son (5yrs old) started watching ultrman tiga on fox sunday mornings..we got the ultraman dyna&tiga movie and loved it..so when we saw ultraman gaia we rushed to buy it..it's an interesting story and we liked that it was a 'kid's story' but there just wasn't enough ultra action in it for us..we'll keep it in our collection, but i wouldn't pay full price for it..this is a matinee movie"
2,Hi!How are you?,"Hi! My name is Karen Cheong.I Like watch Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, Gaia.It is best Ultraman.I hope I can watch Ultraman Gaia- The Battle in Hyperspace (1998)."
3,Bought this for a class,"Bought this for a class and referenced it once or twice to read the essays contained within. Interesting reading, but considering it is little more than a compendium of essays I think it could be cheaper."
5,The Cool Sgt. Pepper's,"Ray Davies apparently looked around at his contemporaries, saw what they were doing - the whole conceptual, literate thang - and decided to one-up 'em....and boy, did he...he really kicked their tails.This nostalgic and heart-felt tribute to English village life in days gone by is just superb, unsurpassable, really. The artistry on display can sneak up on you: many of the songs here show a deceptively light touch, bouncing along catchily, (take for instance, ""Picture Book""), sucking you in, then you see the underlying pathos.Ray Davies really is the great chronicler of Brittania - but you don't have to be a Brit to see and hear and appreciate the beauty and artistry he's putting forth...Now, howzabout that Kinks reunion?"
4,The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society,A good collection of songs by The Kinks. There is a general theme but at times the music can be a little slow.
2,NOT THE FABS,"THE OTHER MUSIC REVIEWERS HERE HAVE RATED THIS LP AS GOOD AS THE BEATLES SARGENT PEPPERS OR STONES SATANIC MAJESTIES LPS,ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THESE TWO CLASSICS OR AS GOOD AS ANY STONES OR BEATLES 60S LPS.THE VOCALS ON VILLAGE GREEN ARE WITHOUT FEELING OR TONE,THE LP HAS WEAK MELODIES.HOWEVER THE LYRICS ARE AMUSING.ITS AN OKAY RELAXING ALBUM OF LIGHTWEIGHT PROPORTIONS.LETS FACE IT,IF THIS IS THE BEST KINKS LP AS SOME WOULD SUGGEST,TO COMPARE THEM TO THE STONES OR BEATLES IS ABSURD.THIS IS NOWHERE CLOSE TO THE EXCELLENCE OF THE BEATLES RUBBER SOUL."
5,Good book; great source of inspiration,"I vastly enjoyed this book. I have to agree that knowledge of Delta Green adds a lot to the book, as characters from other Delta Green books make appearances. That said, if you run Delta Green games you really should read this. If I could run a game that was half as exciting and well- paced as this book, I'd be a very happy Game Master, indeed."
3,soft and warm,"This seemed like a good buy teamed with the free shipping for something I can always use. Personally I like a bulkier sock, but maybe that is why they call them casual.?"
5,Great product!,I'm not given over to long winded speaches so I'll just say this. These socks have held up well and were comfortable over a couple of medium hikes. I think they'll hold up well over some longer ones.AntoniusRome.
5,Great Way To Relive Those Memorable Moments,"The theme music to Australia's Big Brother is a funcky techno track and the remixes are just as awesome. The best though is the song written by the Housemates while in the house. The lyrics are just so funny. Unfortunately the version in this one is sung by Sirens with the Housemates on back up but its still great - get the album to hear the Housemates singing. Congrats Ben on winning, can't wait for series 2"
5,Sparkelind kisses!,"These people know their stuff! Fast, friendly, nice packaging unexpected. The 2 rings I bought were very high quality and a fantastic price too! I would buy from them again and again!"
5,Is this Dave Burgess of Madagascar and The Lion King,"I have this album, it really deserves to be listened to. Has some fantastic work on it, never realised it was four animators including Dave Burgess who worked on Lion King, Madagascar, Tarzan, etc.Well done guys, great album."
5,four animation types loving music in their time off.,"these songs were written and recorded during the end of the 90's by tim allen, dave burgess (that's me), chris jenkins and fraser maclean while they were all working at disney feature animation in burbank, ca.there is a wide variety of style and sound, but the love of playing comes through loud and clear.enjoy!"
4,Something vague,"Since 1996 Tocotronic is considered one of the best german-language bands. Most people are impressed by their ego-philosophical lyrics, their sad journey as lonely individuals for a place in a world they can't understand and which can't understand them either. Their words are pure magic, striking, touching and full of truth and especially this makes them so singular in the international music scene.Still, nobody should put aside their music. Especially Tocotronics early work consisted of slow beats, sad melodies and hard guitar riffs, often expressed in long instrumental parts. K.O.O.K. and their latest, self-titled album, aren't going that way consequently. ""Let there be rock"" shows their gradual maturation and change towards a less-disturbing sound and more lyrical parts. If you like slow, sad songs, sometimes interrupted by fast punk music, and speak german, you really gotta get this one!"
3,"Great band for all, not just Germans","For all of you who love Pavement or other classic indie-rock bands, but who don't know Tocotronic, you are really missing out. This German band outside of Hamburg are amazing and although they are even more enjoyable if you understand German, they are great if you don't. This particular album is their first attempt at adding more melody and complexity to their music, and in my opinion it works. Also check out their self-titled follow up."
4,Dialogues,"Enjoyed the book and the wonderful word puzzles. And, yes, suspected who 'did it' fairly early on. Didn't feel that there was enough of D & P but maybe he will bring them back in to full force in the next one. Always get a kick out of Mr. Hill's idea of an independent woman and when I read his heroines in action, they always remind me of a young 'Mrs. Boooookay' of ""Keeping Up Appearances"". But then maybe that is his idea of the perfect woman, who knows. Am just not sure the ending wasn't a bit of a cop out. Just didn't feel right in this type of book genre. Looking forward to his next book."
4,Hit from Hill; Again!,"Mr. Hill continues to write prolifically but the quality of his writing and the puzzles in his mystery march forward unabatedly.This book (and don't forget Death's Jest Book, published late last year in England, which is a follow up to this one) lifts the modern mystery to new heights. Why am I not giving it a five star? Just because it is too long, and some of it unnecessarily.Especially the love scene details of Rye Pomona and Hat.Still a far cry from and one of greater satisfaction than reading the pseudo British trash from Elizabeth George.Dalziel remains the greates of modern detectives. He surpassed Inspector Morse many a moon ago."
4,a good one,"This is my first Reginald Hill book and I agree with most of what previous reviewers have said about it. It's clever and funny. The Dalziel character was a rare treat. (He doesn't seem as funny on TV.) I thought the ending was great. I didn't figure it out ahead, so I'll probably read this again sometime and see what I missed.I was struck by something in the chapters that dealt with the relationship between Rye & Hat. Their dialog had exactly the same tone as that of Jan and Franklin in Richard Power's The Goldbug Variations.I'll definitely be reading more of Hill's stuff."
5,Dalziel at his gustatory best,"I have read this book several times, and it never fails to delight and intrigue. Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel, is at his wittiest, most offensive, and gustatory best. Each time he enters the story, the reader is in for a treat. The other series characters,including Peter Pascoe, are, as always, remarkably well-drawn. The plot, with its various peregrinations is held together by a brilliant use of literary references and an exploration of the power of words. Reginald Hill mesmerizes the reader through his depiction of good versus evil.Gillian Hanson author ofMurder, That's What"
3,Not my favorite Dalziel and Pascoe,"I agree with another reader that this is not my favorite Dalziel and Pascoe. I am also not a fan of word games, so this might be the problem. I guessed the murderer halfway through the book and never swayed from my choice, which isn't necessarily bad, although I prefer it not to happen. But I found the dialogues increasingly annoying, especially the last one, which was used instead of a more clever approach to tie up the loose ends. If the dialogs actually contained clues (except for the one with the Roman numerals--which I thought was obvious), I certainly didn't catch most of them, and since I was able to figure out everything except the motivation (which I figured out partially) without them, I found them to be a distracting filler."
3,Long view of Hill's series,"As a long-term Reginald Hill fan, I was struck by something odd about this book, when compared with those from the 1970s and 80s: it is timeless, it is no longer social satire or ""comedy of manners."" It can't be, because in real time Pascoe would be over 60, his daughter Rose a university graduate, and Dalziel up in his 80s. Hill obviously knows this. So instead, it is deep into literary devices, which are intrinsic to the plot but the result is detatched not just in terms of social milieu but also in terms of character. Maybe I'm just nostalgic for ""Exit Lines"" and ""Ruling Passion""."
1,Let down,This is the first Reginald Hill book I read. I liked the book just fine and particularly liked the romance between Rye Pomona and D.C. Bowler. I liked the characters of the others also. I skipped a lot as it seemed to be wordy. The reason I give this one star is I felt the author did not play fair with the reader. I do not expect to invest my emotions in characters to be whacked at the end with no warning. I will not read any other books by this author.
3,Not my favorite Reginal Hill,"There isn't much I can add to reviews posted by those who love Reginald Hill and especially Dalziel and Pascoe, but who were disappointed by this book. Without giving anything away, I was very engaged for a good part of it but finally grew tired of the intricacies of the words and symbols; I laughed out loud all the way through as I have with previous Hill books; and I guessed who the murderer probably was well before the ending - not because of motive or character which even by the end I thought were lacking, but because it was inevitable from the whole set-up. On the whole the complexity of the book was undermined by several red herrings and by weak links among the features of the plot (poetry, literary history, personal history of characters and the relationships among them, Biblical references, causes of death, wordplays, possible motives, etc.)."
3,Not the best Dalziel & Pascoe,"The Dalziel & Pascoe series is one of my favorites. I'd give each of the prior books 5 stars. The hallmarks of each book are:1. Complex and surprising plots2. Great lead characters, especially the Fat Man (Dalziel)3. Real, laugh-out-loud humor (most from Dalziel's mouth)4. Well-drawn, believable minor characters5. Very good writingThis one disappointed me. The plot measured up (even if it was more clever than realistic). But the minor characters seemed unbelievable to me, and the writing seemed hurried.I recognize that another thing that bored me about this book may be fascinating and fun for other readers -- the plot revolves around wordplay. If you love word puzzles, you'll like this book a lot more than I did."
2,An intriguing mystery ruined by a disappointing conclusion,"This is the first Daziel/Pascoe mystery I've read in awhile and I was impressed by how quickly I was captivated by it. A clever set up, a short story contest that is used by a serial killer to create a poetic version of the murders that follow, leads into an interesting series of investigations. Pascoe's preoccupation with and old foe, Daziel's bulldogging his way to an answer and the intriguing suspects all point to a solid mystery. Too bad it is spoiled by the ending. The far-fetched nature of the killer's motivation takes away from much of the enjoyment of this mystery for me; an outcome better suited to a B-film noir than a police procedural. Without giving too much away, let's just say it is for the hoariest of psychological reasons, a mostly invalid concept that really doesn't seem to belong here. It's a shame because prior to that I really liked this one but the ending just wrecked it for me."
2,This story takes far too long to tell.,"I have enjoyed several other Dalziel & Pascoe mysteries, but this one seemed to just drag on and on, and got downright boring. I had a pretty good idea early on who the culprit was, and lost interest in finding out the particulars. Cutting it in half would have helped -- nearly 400 pages is a chore. Not one of his best, sorry to say."
3,Without the ending it's one of the best thrillers I've read,"With it, you feel very let down. However, as this is the latest Dalziel and Pascoe novel, the next one in the series may make this ending better. But on its own, after a fantastic read with twist and turns, superb characterisation and genuine tension, you're left with a feeling of complete disappointment"
1,Don't do it,The earring is so small they look like baby earrings. I bought them for my grandma who loves everything. But this she said send them back. Not worth the money.
5,A Vault for Your Long Lens,Well padded with a quality zipper and good straps. Construction is first rate. Nicer than I expected but then LowePro is good at that!
2,Polder Dual Sensor Thermometer & Timer or not,When it works it is great but I have had some trouble getting acurate temperatures. Reads way high at times 500+ when smoker is around 250.
1,Big disappointment,If these ever do return don't waste your money. I loved the features and initially the calibration was pretty much dead-on. But in a little over a year it turned to complete and useless junk. The timer still works if you can manage to set it without going absolutely mad (it is difficult to set at best with no way to back up if you overshoot the value you want) but the thermometer suddenly started reading 20-30 degrees F high on both readouts so the electronics simply failed. The higher-mass oven temperature probe in tandem with the food probe is really a great idea but it just didn't hold up. The sad part is I bought this to replace another one that failed only after a year's service that actually bore a very reputable brand name in thermal instruments. If you want something reliable and even vaguely durable you just have to bite the bullet and purchase a commercial grade instrument for ten times the price. This was clearly junk and I got far less than what I paid for.
1,Horrid product - goes haywire after only a few months of use,"Can I give it no stars? This probe worked great for 3 months. Tonight, I went to use it, and it's telling me that my pork tenderloin, which has only been in the oven for 10 minutes, and is still red, is 250 degrees... or maybe 170... or maybe 300... it can't decide. I changed the battery, no luck. Checked other reviews here... voila... common problem. Well, damn. I didn't buy it from Amazon, but I'll be perusing the site for other, better reviewed products asap. I rely on this kind of temperature probe for ALL my oven and grill meat cooking. Ugh."
5,For grillmeisters everywhere!,"If you grill a lot, you'll really appreciate the convenience of this thermometer! First, since it has two sensors, it will tell you the ambient temperature inside the grill AND also the temperature of the meat you've inserted the probe into. Of course, you can set alarms to tell you when the meat has reached a certain temperature, etc. Not a gadget, this will improve the quality of your grilling."
1,It's quit working - Unreliable,"This thing worked for a while but now it is acting very strangely. I tried to get information from Polder online and found no supporting documentation. My guess is that the probe is the problem, but a replacement probe is $20 and a new complete unit is $25. I guess I will fall back on the old reliable analog manual stick-in-the-meat thermometer and trash the Polder."
1,Please don't waste your money.,"I purchased this for use with my smoker, right out of the box, it worked great. The controls are intuitive and well designed. Worked like a charm until the second time around when it started registering inaccurate temperatures. I was extremely careful with the probe, not getting it wet or crushing it. I've tested many thermometers and this is by far the worse. It now registers about 50-80 degrees too hot."
2,Good Idea...bad implementation,"This thermometer would be great if it actually worked as all of the chefs who recommended it suggest. As written in another review, the tech support people at Polder say it should be used as an instant read thermometer, and then removed from the food. If that is the case, why would you have an alarm that sounded when the food reached a specific temperature?In addition, the temperature readings can be off significantly. I keep 3 extra probes on hand, in case one doesn't read properly.On the other hand, I sent the original one back to Polder and they replaced it without question.I don't think I would buy another one."
2,stopped working after only a few uses!,"Though it worked well on a few occasions, it stopped giving correct readings after just a matter of months. I wasn't sure I needed to spend $50 or so on a probe thermometer, but apparently I was wrong, because this $30 ""deal"" definitely turned out to be a dud. There's a newer Polder model that has received excellent reviews and seems to be a much better buy."
1,Works great until it breaks,"Fresh off the shelf, when it still works, this does exactly what you would want it to. Stick it in a turkey or rib roast and cook till the moment of perfection.Unfortunately you'll be lucky to get a few meals out of it before the probe breaks. After that it shows 90 degrees Fahrenheit at room temperature and flashes 500 at the first sign of actual heat. Replacement probes cost almost as much as the entire unit.I'll admit I'm dumb enough to have gone through three of these things. Save yourself the trouble."
2,"Some good news, it can come back to life","After sitting a while, I discovered that the unit is reporting normal temperatures again. This would suggest that something got wet (in the probe) but letting it dry makes it work again.I don't know if I can trust it yet."
2,Polder dual sensor thermometer and timer,"This electronic device has some very nice features such as a probe which keeps tabs on the oven temperature as well as the internal temperature of the roast. However, it has one major flaw: the alarm is very weak. You might not hear it even in the kitchen if there is much background noise, and you almost certainly will not hear it in another room."
2,"Overly complicated, broken in one month","I have had two previous Polder products that I would recommend. However, the Polder Oven/Meat Thermo-timer I would not recommend. The controls only allow to raise your desired tempurature. Miss you mark, and its a long way to 500 degress and back to the tempurature you want. My older Polder has buttons to raise or lower the desired temp. After about one month, the tempurature gage just went nuts. It read barely (not roiling) boiling water as 260 degrees. No, I was not touching the container etc. So for $30 I got a fancy timer. Purchase either an earlier, simplier model from Polder or a different brand but NOT this one."
1,Probe is a bust!,"According to the directions included with the unit ""If the temperature/display unit reads ""Hi"" or ""Lo"" instead of the probe temperature while not measuring cooking temperature; it is likely that the probe is damanged and needs to be replaced"". I used the probe exactly 2 times before it broke. Of course it is not covered by the warranty!"
2,"Unreliable, unhelpful, and hard to use","Worked OK for a couple of years, but left me in the lurch this Easter when it decided that ambient air temperature in my kitchen was about 200F. The oven sensor isn't all that useful, and the controls are frustrating -- too many small buttons that do too many things. I'll go with a simpler model next time."
1,Good while it lasted...,"Thought I'd spend a bit more and buy a quality product. The dual thermometers worked great for the first several months (about 15 uses). Then the food portion of the digital read-out started going haywire, consistently registering 178 degrees before I'd insert the prong into the meat (the oven portion worked fine). I made the mistake of not reading reviews before I bought this product."
5,Couldn't BBQ without it!,"I've been using this Polder going on eight years, and for my purposes, it's the Mack Daddy! I frequently BBQ in a ceramic, Kamado-style smoker/grill, and when smoking low and slow, you can't be opening the lid! This thermometer has been dead on accurate, both for the temp inside my smoker, as well as the meat. I highly recommend this item for the grilling/smoking chef!"
4,"WORKS GREAT, once you find out...","that the probe is NOT WATERPROOF and you cannot submerge it in water.This will cause all sorts of crazy readings. So, just WIPE THE PROBE CLEAN, dry it, and put it away.I returned my probe to working order by placing the probe, not the meter in a toaster oven and baked it for a few hours @ 400. Since then, no problems and have been using it for 3-4 years.Some commented about not being able to use it in a BBQ pit or oven. I do that all the time with no issues."
1,Piece o' Junk,"Accidently stumbled into this at amazon. I had purchased one of these myself because it seemed like the perfect temperature measuring product. I had the same problems with both the food and oven temperatures being WAY, WAY out of wack. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you can see if the sensors work and if they don't take it back right away.In fairness to Poulder, they usually have a top notch thermometer and have traditionally been my favorite. They have just botched this one BIG TIME.If Poulder reads these for product feed back, here's an idea that would sell like hot-cakes. Fix this rig so it works. That's step one. Step two: make one that transmits a signal to a receiver that can be read in another room. (I have one and it works great)"
1,off calibration,"from the first time i tried to use the polder brand, the calibration was way off ( over 100 degrees). i returned this themometer to polder 6 weeks ago and have yet to hear anything back from them. i would suggest buying a taylor thermometer,i have had very good results with the taylor."
1,Does not last,"I bought this in late October in anticipation for Thanksgiving. During that time, it was used successfully only once. Three days before turkey day, I attempted to use it for a second time. It was broken. The oven temp channel seems to work, but the meat temp was reading 300-315F. It seems like the thermocouple was shorted out. The bad news: A replacement probe = $20I would recommend the Taylor model with the silicon probe cable. The silicon will last longer than the braided cable."
1,Don't buy it.,"I hate to break it to ya, but everyone is right. My Polder Dual Sensor also went crazy after only two months. It was beautiful while it lasted. Can't wait to find something that LASTS."
1,I rate this zero stars,Same as eveyone else below. Used one time at temps below 300F and probe went bad. Do not buy one of these unless you only want one use out of it. Hope this helps :-)
1,When good products go bad.,"My original polder timer/thermometer died last month after 8 years of wonderful service. I was so happy with it that I bought the new model without hesitation. I just returned it to the store today, and I never even used it in the oven. Trying to use it as a timer was a major pain compared to the first model. Mushy buttons. Alarm sounds for only 21 secs. Doesn't reset to original time for multiple countdowns, instead it counts up. Slow to set minutes. Large footprint. Too many buttons. Designed to save the battery and not for ease of use or convenience. What a disappointment."
2,Not So Hot Thermometer,"This thermometer has definate problems. It will start flashing different temperature readings throughout your cooking process. You don't know what reading to believe. At that point, I just have to rely on instinct. That's what I was doing prior to purchasing this thermometer. It has worked for me in the past, but the more I use it, the more problems are occurring.I just purchased the Mavericks ET-73. I'm going to give that one a whirl. Stay tuned."
1,Brand new and not working,"Well, I got one of these for Christmas. The first time I plug the cable in, straight out of the box, it tells me the ambient temp is 380F. Only the worst sort of junk isn't even tested before leaving the factory. Give Polder a very wide berth."
1,Polder should give up on the thermometer business,I've had 2 Polder Thermometers and both of them have had a VERY short life span. Don't waste your money!
2,"Great Concept, poorly implemented","I loved the idea of a dual thermometer. Might have been good if it worked more than 3 times. This device lacks robustness needed for the job as advertized. On top of that setting the alert temperature is a real pain. It only goes up, not up and down. So if you overshoot your 165 setting its all the way up into the 400's before you start over again. The timer is a pain to use as well. I chucked this sucker and got seperate timer. Still looking for a thermometer."
1,poor quality/nonexistent customer service,the probe got fried right away. Have had a difficult time trying to contact Polder to get a replacement under warrenty. Their customer service is very poor. I would not recommend buying this product at all.
1,Don't buy it.,I made a mistake and did not read the other reviews. It did not work out of the box and registered 400 degrees in a 300 degree oven.
2,different styles,"the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different. the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design). The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered. not happy with my overall experience."
3,"trade, don't buy","This is not an official release, but rather a widely sold bootleg of a Cracker show from some time in '93 (I believe from L.A.) with some filler performances. All in all, it is very good. But you can easily trade for the music on a bootleg trading site (Cracker allows recording and trading of their concert material for free). There's no need to spend big bucks on this."
2,Works but is a bit wobbly and had problems assembling.,"I didn't think I could be unsatisfied with a paper towel holderbut this one was annoying enough to write a review.The main rod would not screw into the base as described in the instructions. Maybe the screw hole was just faulty in this onebut ended up having to use use my own nuts/washers to tighten the holder.Also, when replacing the paper towels, you have to unscrew thetop ""knob"" which is not very convenient."
1,"Not functional, poor quality...","Not functional, bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it. Impossible to use -the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly. Also, it came in a box that was damaged and taped together (not the shipping box, the Polder box that the product comes in)...looks like someone returned it previously (probably for the same reasons) and it was then sent to me. I still have it because I was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted. Time to throw it out - waste of money."
1,Polder Stainless Steel Upright Paper Towel Holder is JUNK!,I won't even waste any more that the minimum space - don't buy this piece of crap - you are better off using a tree branch.
2,It's not rocket science.,"I'd return this paper towel holder if it were worth the time and effort, but it's not. You'd think assembly wouldn't be complicated. It's a paper towel holder for pete's sake. But the quality is shoddy, and the design is somewhat nonsensical. Paper towels easily fit through the center rod without removing anything. Great! So why, then, make the middle rod three separate pieces that need to be screwed together, as opposed to just one piece? Not so great. And upon screwing the middle rod to the base, the bottom of the base fell off. Because this is sold by Target, there's tax and shipping. So for about the same amount (maybe less), you can get a better made paper towel holder from Bed, Bath, & Beyond."
1,I gave up,"I had the feeling there must be some suplimentary material I was missing while trying to read this book. Alot of ideas that had no explanation. Basically I gave up trying make use of this book.It has some of the usual stuff included in books on this subject, like instrument ranges. For me, there were just too many ideas without a clue as to HOW to do it. You might as well say ""try to make good sounding songs"" ""try to keep your melodies interesting"" ""use discipline, and good judgment in your arrangment"". If you are a fan of this style of advice and teaching, then you will love this book."
4,Master teacher,"Dick Grove was a master teacher, and during his life generated reams of didactic material. For those of us lucky enough to sit under his teaching he was an amazing and inspiring mentor. During my year at Dick Grove School of Music he generated dozens of pages of teaching material weekly. We would carry around thick three ring binders which got heavier every week.Having said all that, this book is just a small segment of his vast reservoir of thinking on music, and should be seen as only a part of the picture. You would probably need to get more of his books in order to to fill out the picture. Also, this material may have been intended to be used in his classes, which would account for the minimal explanations. I also think that he was always moving forward in his search to explain music, and this book may be a snapshot of where he was at this point in time, but not where he ended up."
5,Perfect for it's purpose,"I bought this case so I could carry my Canon 28-135mm lens attached to my Lowepro toploader Pro 75 AW, and it works for that. With some coaxing I am able to fit the lens hood into the case, too. I put the lens in first and then put the hood in over the back end of it--it's tight, but it works."
3,Diameter too small for lens hood,"Although very well constructed with many tiny little features, this case hugs the lens too close. There is very little padding between the lens and the outer surface of the case. I have a 72mm filter-thread lens from Sigma that is the right length for this case but it has to be squeezed in if the lens hood is retained. It's so tight that a bump from the outside seems like it will snap the lens hood. The freebie cases that Sigma provides along with their EX lenses all come with foam pads at the top and bottom. Besides protection for the top and bottom, this foam suspends the lens down the middle of the case so that there is some air gap protecting the lens from bumps against the case as well as allowing an easy fit for the lens hood."
1,amazon was bad,"The case is barely ok . Amazon , handles this situation was bad , very bad . I am not happy at all ."
3,Does not fit Canon 70-300mm,"Bought this case specifically for the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM telephoto lens, but unfortunately, it did not fit. This case is for smaller lenses, not the big long ones. Beware. Product is good, but make sure your lens fits first!"
5,Good addition to camera bag,"This lens case fits snugly on my new Lowepro camera bag, and it's secured with super strong velcro. I'm not worried about it coming loose from the bag. I would highly recommend it to others."
5,Better than I expected ...,I wanted a case for my 55-200 Nikon lens to use either on my waist belt or on another Lowepro case. It's nice and compact and while snug with the hood ... works. It's water resistant ... that's good and it's reasonably fast access. I like the lens cap keeper. Fits tight and securely and gives me several carrying options no matter if I'm using a Slingshot or my Camelbak pack. Good choice.
4,Fuji Finepix S1800 fits snugly,"I measured my camera and checked the inside dimensions of this case and decided to take a chance and buy this. My Fuji Finepix S1800 with lens cap slides in with a little effort and has enough room at the top to coil the neck strap and my spudz cloth.I was looking for a case to protect the camera while it was in my purse and I think this will work. I also have the option of using the velcro fasteners and attaching it to the strap of my bag.There's a removable plastic stiffener behind the padding on the fastener side of the case. Since the back of my camera is flat, I'm leaving it in, but for those using it for lenses, it might work better without it.I might use the webbing in the lid meant to hold a lens cap for extra batteries."
5,Quality Lens Protection...,I am very pleased with my 5th purchase of a Lowepro Lens case to securely store my Hasselblad and Nikon lenses. They are extremely well made and a bargain for under $20.00. I highly recommend Lowpro's products. You will NOT be dissapointed!!
1,GARBAGE,"We have purchased two of these for our very small office.within weeks both machines developed problems - after switching to energy saving mode they would not restart unless power was switched on and off 2-3 times. Then they started to be choosy wether to accept a fax or not - most of the time they didn't.since we have purchased several extra cartridges, we decided to buy one more (perhaps the first two came from a bad batch).Same problem.these machines are made in China, with no respect to quality control, and you will be throwing your money away.And yes, we tried to repair them, repair was more than the machine was worth. Warranty wasn't respected since there was NO SERIAL NUMBER on these things.I have never seen worse mulitprinter"
1,Sizing says large. But it's for kids not adults.,I ordered this thinking it would be for adults it being large. It didn't say it was child's large. Another wasted amazon purchase
4,Great Lense Protection For Modular Setups,"I love the Lowepro Lens Cases and I own 2 of them already. My first was the Lowepro Lens Case 1 which I use to house my Canon 100mm Macro lens (a bit of a tight fit but it works). The Lowepro Lens Case 1S is a perfect fit for the Canon 18-55mm kit lens that came with my XTI. Since I've opted for a messenger bag to hold my gear instead of a traditional camera bag, the Lowepro cases have been the perfect option to keep my lenses safe in my bag."
5,Case for Nikon 50mm f/1.8,I bought this to use with my Nikon 50mm f/1.8 and screw on rubber lens hood.It is a perfect match there is know movement within the case.I would highly recommend this for this combination.......
4,tight fit for the 18-55 lens,"Several reviewers seemed to think this was a good cover for the Canon 18-55 lens that comes with the Xsi kit. Seems tight to me.Otherwise it is an okay case. I own a Sigma lens case (which comes with the lens) and I'll rate it better in build and protection. If Sigma sold just len cases, I'd buy theirs."
2,Better Options out there,"Not a bad product. Regular Tennis Balls work best with the launcher, I've found, and are much more durable and less expensive. My Weimaraner and I go through a lot of balls when we train. IMHO you're paying extra for the color and printing."
1,NOT AS DURABLE AS REGULAR TENNIS BALLS!,My black lab mix went for these balls like a cat goes for catnip. Probably because of the bright colors. Unfortunately these CHUCKIT balls can't withstand a RIGOROUS play session without FALLING APART. We have used Tennis balls for [2] years with no problem. One of these balls lasted less than [1] HOUR and the others don't look like they will last for much more time than a week!
2,Chuck It for an Ultra Ball,"These are the tennis-type balls that come with the original Chuckit thrower. They're OK, but they don't go the distance or have the ""mouth appeal"" of the Ultra Chuckit ball. My yard is littered with these balls and none of my dogs will play with them, only the Ultra ball or various Planet Dog balls. Plus, according to The Whole Dog Journal, these colorful tennis balls are laden with chemicals that aren't healthy for your dog. Spend the money on Ultra ChuckIt balls; They cost more but last longer, fly farther, and are easy to clean.This product has been rated by two young Labs (brothers), a Golden Retriever and a Beagle."
2,Tennis balls are better,I thought since the Chuckit super balls were so durable I'd give these a try. These are good for 1-2 fetch outings each with my Labs. Regular tennis balls are much more durable and can be bought for a fraction on the price per ball.
1,awful!,"My dogs (lab & golden retriever) destroyed these in a matter of minutes, then I had to take them away for fear of choking. DO NOT ORDER. All of the rubber chuckit! balls are amazing and my dogs love them!"
1,BAD PRODUCT !! A TOTAL RIP OFF!! DO NOT BUY THESE,"People listen to me. The people who write good reviews on this product either have small dog who doesn't know how to chew or they are someone who works for the company and is lying.My tiny Boston Terrier broke all four balls in 3 days. Once they get the cover off they split in half and are no good. You have to keep these balls away from your dog when you are not playing with them. Better yet just get some cheap tennis balls. The work the same with the thrower device and won't split in half like these cheap, worthless, piece of **** do.I want my money back. I Chucked my money right down the drain.Rip-off."
3,Following Yonder Star by Skip Ewing,"We looked for years to see who sang the song Christmas Carol (My name is Christmas Carol, I was born on Christmas Day...) and come to find out it is Skip Ewing! He does alright overall but our main plan was to get that one song. I noticed some CD's priced at $80-$90 on Amazon, don't pay that much! The only traditional song on this set is Silent Night, everything else is new age (I guess that is what you would call it). So, if your looking to get a song or two yes, it was well worth the couple bucks we paid, but I wouldn't have paid much more for this cassette."
3,Thin but OK,These are replacing heavier steel/enameled covers which I tried to locate but for which could not find suitable replacements.I'm OK with them. They'll do.
2,Not as expected,The color is more off white than white. Can definitely notice the color when they are placed on a white stove top.
1,Not worth seeing.,"I was looking forward to seeing the film because I admired Zukovic's ""The Last Big Thing."" Not on the same level at all--this film was horribly boring; the characters were ill-developed and not amusing. Their ""chemistry"" took over the entire film but was teeth-wrenching to watch. I didn't watch the second half."
1,After market ink,"Didn't work well with my BJC-85. Prints were patchy and stripy. Tried cleaning the print heads, did nozzle checks, switched cartridges. Only thing that fixed the issues was switching back to ink from Cannon."
2,Generic,"The first chapter of this book on this history of the Newfoundland was good, but after that I felt like the authors used pretty much the same material, inserting the name of the breed they were writing about. There was a lot of generic info on dogs, with mentions that Newfoundlands are big (duh). The pictures were nice, but I didn't really buy the book for the pictures. I was not impressed."
4,Good book,"It give a lot of information about Newfies in it including the history, care, and even has some tips on training."
3,Decent Book if Your Considering this Breed but...,I would say the book starts off strong with the history and physiology of the Newfoundland but begins to fall off and become just a generic dog care book. I reason I bought the book was because I wanted to sharpen up my grooming skills with my Newfoundland and the book didn't provide good enough information or a solid reference on that aspect. But overall I thought the book would serve as a resource or people looking into that particular breed and has never own one. Doesn't do much for people who already have a Newfoundland.
5,cute,"First of all, when it comes to moccasins, Minnetonka is the brand to look for. These moccasins are well made, cute and comfy!"
5,Wonderful book!!!,This book is written very well and has such an amazing story/ journey in it. I just finished reading it and loved it so much I am immediatly going to read it again (I never do that!).I strongly recommend it!
1,Imation RDX Removable Hard Disk Cartridge 160GB,"Ordered two through Amazon for back up drive. COMPUTER BRAIN supplied the cartridges. These were received on or around 21 December, and one of the cartridges is bad. As these are back up cartridges, we used the first one, and then today 20 January used the second back up cartridge and found out it is bad. COMPUTER BRAIN would not replace the cartridge as it was after 20 days, however, I think they should have replaced the cartridge. Lastly, their customer service person who handled the call couldn't give a damn about future sales and was obnoxious and said we now have to send the cartridge back to the manufacturer. I won't be using COMPUTER BRAIN again ... What if I had bought 6 cartridges, would I have had to test each one of them as soon as I opened the package??? Plain stupid."
5,The top of the mountain,"It's hard to believe this record is 20 years old. It still sounds futuristic. This to me is the apex of the Talking Heads sound. As much as I enjoy Speaking in Tongues, it's sort of a retreat from the advances made on this milestone. I got it when it was about a year old on LP and I always thought the ""Once in a Lifetime"" side was the first side, and that the funk trifecta was side B. If I had my druthers, I think I would prefer the song order that way. But that doesn't take away from the phenomenal epochal quality of this record. Check out Seen and Not Seen, one of their all-time great ""lost"" Talking Heads songs. Guaranteed to put you in a trance. And the older I get, the more sense the ""How did I get here"" philosophy of ""Once in a LIfetime"" makes."
5,"It's not perfect but nothing is, even if it's this tight.","Personally, I think this album is theee BOMB, but it's not for everyone. This album is seriously rich with sounds, funk, and concepts that you can't really find anywhere else. It's full of all kinds of funky african and weird whiteboy influences, but this album is not to be looked at as an ethnographer's project. It's just a synthesis that these musicians arrived at. It's a heavy and dense album. Good for dancing to if you don't mind weird abstract lyrics in your funk. It's got some amazing musicianship in it, and because in many ways it's way off the map, it's worth a listen by just about everybody."
5,Modern music starts here...,"A landmark recording by anyone's reckoning, Remain in Light makes 99 percent of other recorded music look depressingly unimaginative, colourless and downright tired by comparison. Breathtakingly innovative in every nuance from its dense, layered rhythm beds to the exuberance of Byrne's vocals, the sheer tightness of the ensemble and Eno's dizzying production sheen, RIL proves conclusively that sometimes ""clever"" is an infinitely more satisfying meal than ""dumb""."
3,breakdancing?,"All I remember about this album when it came out was the breakdancing dude in the video of one of the tunes (I believe it was ""Crosseyed and Painless"") which I thought a weird direction for the band to take.Certainly, ""Once in A Lifetime"" is a classic but other than this and the aforementioned ""Crosseyed...,"" I only like ""Born Under Punches.""Coming on the heels of the Fear Of Music album, I felt this album was a letdown. I still rarely play the whole thing through from beginning to end.Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think this is one of the weakest releases by a terrific band."
4,still good but earlier albums better,"i am a huge talking heads fan,but this album ranks no 4 on my list. their previous 3 albums are a bit more funkier and catchy. though i have to admit the great curve (off remain in light) is one of my favourites. buy all 4 you wont be disappointed!"
3,Road to Nowhere,"Despite its critical success, I think this is one of TH's worst efforts. From beginning to end, the whole album sounds like one big mush. Conventional song structures are almost entirely replaced by a polyrhythmic goulash of sound which doesn't offer memorable melodies, hooks and songs. ""Once in.."" is the one and only standout track here and the only hit single emerging from this album. ""Born under.."" and ""Crosseyed.."" aren't bad, either, but listening to the second half of this cd is like walking in mud and truly means nothing to me. In my opinion ""More songs.."" and ""Speaking in tongues"" are much more accessible and enjoyable. Chris' and Tina's ""Tom Tom Club"" debut is very nice, too."
1,The Advanced Resolution Stereo and 5.1 Still Don't Work!,"I returned the Brick to Rhino because my Onkyo DVD-A player could not access the Advanced Resolution Stereo and 5.1 tracks. Not only couldn't I access those tracks, my machine would freeze.So, I bought this new reissue of ""Remain In Light"" hoping the problem with the Brick version would be corrected. No such luck.Thanks Rhino."
3,half and half,"Half the songs are really good, half are boring:Really good1) Crosseyed and Painless2) Houses in Motion3) Once in a Lifetime4) The Great CurveDecent1) Born Under PunchesBoring1) Listening Wind2) Seen and Not Seen3) The Overload"
3,"Great material, junk packaging","I HATE DIGIPAKS! If I had known that this disc would come in a digipak, I would never have purchased it.5 stars for the material, zero stars for the cursed digipak."
5,One of the all time greats,"This is a very special album. One of the best ever by anyone. Daring, original, brilliant, and enduring. If you love music, owning this album is not optional, it's essential."
4,Percussive Masterpiece,"Remain In Light followed the experimental textures of Fear Of Music, although here the polyrhythmic beats are more accessible especially on the awesome track Once In A Lifetime with its poetic lyrics and gripping hooks. My other favorites here are the funky dance track Crosseyed And Painless and Houses In Motion. The first is the apex of the first percussive and funky part of the album while the second has more in common with the last tracks like Listening Wind, Seen And Not Seen and Overload, where the tone becomes somber and introspective. Overall, the instrumental mix and the arrangements are most impressive and this album, though experimental, is more accessible thanFear of Music.The Best of Talking Heads"
3,"I did not like it then, and still can't see the point now.","Despite all critical acclaims this is the album that drove me away from Talking Heads. I had eagerly awaited for it due to all the good reviews, and was mightily disappointed when I eventually got it. Not that it is a bad album per se, but I - as a listener - was moving in the exact opposite direction.While I have mellowed out after all these years - and I am no longer embarked in a crusade against all things featuring a danceable 4/4 rhythm - I still fail to grasp the aim of this album.It might be just me, but I think that ""Fear of Music"" and ""More songs"" are on a different - much better - plane."
4,Great music - Poor format,"I have yet to be able to play this disc at full 96K audio resolution. All of the DVD-A players I have tried it on choke on the DVD-A track.That being said, they can all access the regular DVD Dolby 5.1 track, and while that isn't as good as the unplayable DVD-A track, it still sounds great. The remastering is really top notch, and the surround format works very well with this highly percussive and multi-tracked recording. This is one of my favorite albums, and it has never sounded better. A huge improvement over the original CD release.Which is why it irks me all the more that I can't get to the DVD-A track. I bought two other Talking Heads DVD-A discs, and they all exhibited exactly the same problems. The whole set should have been recalled. This disc is just good enough that I won't send it back, but if had been any lesser recording I would have demanded my money back."
1,DVD side locks up my Yamaha player,I have a recent Yamaha 6760 SACD/DVD-A player and this disc locks it up hard--I have to unplug the player to reset it. (Another review here notes the same issue with an Onkyo player.)I own dozens of DVD-A and SACD titles and I've never had an issue like this with another disc.I've emailed Rhino twice in two weeks with no response yet.UPDATE: The new DVD-Audio new release is out now. Get that. Great! Too bad it took years to fix this.
5,GET DOWN!,"Where is the line between rock and funk?dance and punk?drone and rhythm?Remain in Light bridges gaps like no other.An exceptionally dense album, merging funk rock and punk ethos with african rhythm and art lyrics.Always engaging, with its group vocal choruses, masses of polyphonic percussion, amazing and peculiar delivery from David Byrne, and a plethora of treated instruments filling out (and sticking out!) in each of the songs, this is not only Talking Heads' perfect album, but a true 'one off' original in pop history."
3,interesting beat,Not the right music for dancing but this album has good/interesting lyrics and beat.
1,Waste of time and money,Full of wrong information and the author obviously has no knowledge of martial arts. Do not waste your money.
2,Asking For Trouble,"Why call it 'Funny or Die'? Thats a kiss of death. Actually, 'Kiss of Death' would have been better. FoD is an awful, awful title. I nearly avoided it on the strength of that alone... sounds like desperation. Unfortunately, some of it looks like desperation too. There are sketches on here so bad that they'd look amateurish on Youtube. If you knew the people who'd uploaded them you'd feel embarrassed for them. But, there is some sublime weirdness. The Carpet Brothers is a wonderful Wes Andersonesque 70s pastiche. It doesnt keep the thing afloat by itself but it saves it from sinking like a stone.The 60's salesman doing the links is pretty good too... but that title... yuch!"
1,"I guess you have to go with ""Die"" because this isn't Funny at all.","Wow. Just wow. This is probably the most unfunny DVD ever. I love comedy and I love the concept of more off the wall skits, but this just sucks. Even the scarce few parts that are funny are quickly ruined by bad timing or excessive repetition. An example would be the two dudes with the ridiculous snakes meeting. It was funny when they stood there saying ""snakes"" back and forth 5 times, it was all lost when they proceeded to say snakes for 2 more minutes."
4,Rox Goes Dance,"The crashing guitars may be gone, but still this a good roxette song, the rhythm and melody that distinguish roxette gets thru the techno riffs of this their 3rd single from HAVE A NICE DAY! This single also contains Club Mixes by Almighty and X-treme which will appeal to avid clubkids. A must for Rox fans and for those not familiar with them a good addition to their pop library."
2,AMAZON--HOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH?,"A priority reason for buying a subnotebook or mini-laptop is its weight---but nowhere on the Amazon Ad, remarkably, is the weight given. What gives?"
5,Salsa 101 Made Easy,"Moira and Evan, the teachers for Learn to Dance Salsa Beginners' volume 1 are excellent. They seem to be very patient and in tune with the needs of new Salsa dancers. They were intricate in their description of the counts and the movements that needed special attention in order to properly do the basic step. In addition to the basic step, some simple turns are taught and information on Salsa etiquette is provided via the special features included on the DVD."
5,Salsa using logic and layman's terms,"This video was great in teaching the fundamentals as well as hints and important things to remember for each lesson. For the beginners, this is a wonderful video. I would recommend for those whose have the basic step down already to purchase the 2nd one at the same time. My husband and I went through the beginners DVD really quickly. He's danced (unstructured) Salsa and had to ""un-learn"" some of the improper things that prohibit good flow between a couple. Overall a wonderful video. The gentleman in the video is a natural teacher, that helps."
5,Move over Don Juan,I'd been to a Salsa club or two and been able to keep up but never really felt comfortable or that I really knew what I was doing. But then I got this DVD. I'm not Don Juan out there yet but I'm on my way.
5,Wonderful Dance Tool,"The Learn to Dance Salsa series by Salsa Crazy is a great teaching tool. It's very easy to follow. The instructors offer ample opportunities for students to pick up the dance steps that are being taught and the producers of the video have included picture-in-picture type camera angles of the hands, hips, and /or body so that students can see, without reservation, what they should be doing."
4,Good basics but without flair,"If you're looking for a DVD that shows good basic moves, this is it! It covers connection with your partner, how to move your hips and body, where to place your feet and then gives you a few basic moves that are useful. It definitely doesn't go into as much depth as a lot of the DVD's on the market. But it covers the basics VERY well. IF you're looking for something flashy, though, this isn't it. It is simple and to the point. I would recommend learning basics from this DVD and then moving on to a second DVD from another collection."
4,Maybe its just me,"I bought it because of all the great reviews. It is good but for a total beginner I feel there are some problms. On some parts I started ""getting it"" once I turned the volume down and jsut watched. It seemed that some parts contrdicted (instruction didn't match the movements) what the actor was saying (counting, putting feet ""together"" and the bouncing); plus, while some parts are at the right pace, the important basic parts they zoom right through asssuming you got it. The dude wears black so it would be better if he were in light clothes against the dark backdrop.It could be that i am just completely uncoordinated but I think it's geared toward those who have some dance knowledge; those people will know the basics so it'll be easier."
5,GREAT DVD and FUN!!! way to learn Salsa!!,This DVD helped even this idiot reviewer pick up the basics in no time at all! My boyfriend and I thought we were doomed to watch from the sidelines until this DVD walked us through the dance with easy step-by-step instructions that kept even us from tripping over each other and our own feet. We can't wait to surprise everyone at our wedding reception!!The DVD allows dancers to work at their own speed instead of worrying about keeping up with a class in the privacy of their own home. One can back up the DVD or use the user-friendly searchable menu to back up and review as needed.Salsa is great fun as well as wonderful exercise! Highly recommend this DVD!
4,SALSA ANYONE?,This is the BEST at home tape I have seen. I bought it originally for my husband so he could practice in the comfort of our home so we could go out and dance. He didn't feel comfortable going to a class and we have a small child. I really love it and plan on expanding our knowledge of dancing. The only thing I was not to crazy about is the dark area where it is being recorded at. But we love it.
2,CD quality,The CD is low quality because cannot it get through the entire lesson without it starting and stopping several times. You should send me a new Learn to dance salsa vol. 1 and vol. 2 without the interruptions.Thanks
4,a harbinger of concept albums to come?,"There are enough songs on this album about the music industry itself, that this album hints at all the concepts to come (preservation, soap opera, schoolboys). The songs on this album exhibit a good range of bitterness, cynicism, some wistfulness, with a bit of whining thrown in.The classics ""Apeman"" and ""Lola"" are enough reasons to buy. There are a number of other great songs on here, including ""Strangers,"" (from Dave) ""This Time Tomorrow,"" and ""Get Back in Line."" I particularly like the hard acoustic sound on many of the songs.The Kinks put out a lot of albums before and after this. While I enjoyed most of the songs on all their albums to come, for me this album gets bunched as the last of their earlier, classic albums, as I enjoy every song on it."
1,best wait until Amazon clears out its current inventory,"I love the older Kinks tracks and ordered this to fill out of my collection. I still buy CD's because I use the flac format on my music server and ripping tracks to this format is still cheaper than downloading tracks in this format. I only use MP3's on my portables.Unfortunately, both the CD they initially sent me and its replacement would not rip or play in any of my drives or changers due to some kind of manufacturing defect. The CD label was smeared and there was a couple of big black spots (that appear to be the same type of ink) on the opposite side. Cleaning the spots off did not help."
4,What could have been,"If the three weak tracks : The Contender, Got To Be Free ,and Rats were subtracted from this album and the flip side of Lola : Mindless Child Of Motherhood and God's Children , Dreams , and The Way Love Used To Be from The Kinks soundtrack to Percy were added in their place , one might argue that the result might have been one of the greatest albums of all time. Alas, as it stands with the exception of those three songs one finds The Kinks still at the top of their game which would continue through their next album Muswell Hillbillies."
4,but don't get this version,"The 1998 remastered import version has a superior alternate version of ""Apeman"" as a bonus track, so get that instead."
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"This might be the best Kinks album, although Muswell Hillbillies and Village Green Preservation Society are right up there, along with just about everything else they ever released. Only the classic Lola gets any airplay. The rockers Powerman and Top Of The Pops deserves every bit as much. Get Back In The Line and Denmark Street are extremely well written. You can see what Ray is singing about. Dave's guitar work here is great as always and the band sounds real tight. Forget Pink Floyd, The Kinks were the true masters of the concept album. The central theme here is a rock star makes it to the top and then burns out due to all the stress the lifestyle puts on him. Absolutely a classic. One of about 13 Kinks albums that everyone on the planet should own."
4,Almost Perfect,"I first bought this album because the morning show that I would listen to on the radio in SLC (Radio from Hell) would sometimes play ""Apeman"" as an intro song. After hearing it about half a dozen times, I finally decided to hunt down this CD. I concur with the opinions expressed by many of the previous reviewers. This is a stellar album, and I am disappointed in myself that I hadn't heard it earlier in my life. I do have one complaint for which I am subtracting one star. To my ears, this CD desperately needs to be remastered. The mix sounds tinny and weak. For me, this is most apparent on the song ""Apeman"" - the reason I bought the album. The vocals seem to be buried underneath the the instrumentation. I bought my copy used, so perhaps it was an earlier release CD, and there has since been a remastered release. But believe me, you will not regret purchasing this album."
5,great album,"as a big fan of all things kinky,i have over 30 kinks cds. ray writes as good or better songs than anyone who ever lived. this is one of thier best albums, one that i would throw in with my dark side of the moon, ect. to go to my deserted island.very smart lyrics that touch you on an emotional level as well."
3,Bought for Lola,"I like several of the Kinks' hits from the 60's (think Pirate Radio) but I'm not a big Kinks fan. So I can't say how this album compares to other Kinks' albums. This was the only way I could get a good version of Lola so that is the only reason I bought this CD. I give Lola 5 stars, 4-5 of the songs on this album 4 stars, and 5-6 others at least 3 stars. So I rate the album as a whole 3.2 - 3.3 stars. A very decent album. If you like the Kinks music, you will like this album."
5,Really happy I bought it,"I am not a huge Kinks fan, but I had this album during college in the late 80s, and was reminded of it during the ""Darjeeling Limited."" And for a month after the movie I couldn't get ""This Time Tomorrow"" and ""Strangers"" out of my head (I had totally forgotten about those songs until the movie, too!), and so I went out and bought it. I'm very glad I did. This is really an outstanding album, and while the lyrics are a bit too simple at times, in general the concept works, and musically it's incredibly compelling. The opening to ""Powerman"" is one of the most evocative pieces of rock music you're going to find, but it's hard to single out particular songs as being standouts, because most of them are. The album has also aged incredibly well, and most of it doesn't feel very dated at all (but ""Rats"" feels like a piece of music of its time -- you could almost see Austin Powers grooving to it). Overall, if you're not sure if it's worth it to buy it, it is."
2,well directed but confusing,"i'm really glad that other people found this movie confusing at times. i was afriad i was just stupid or something. i actually watched the movie twice, trying to go back and piece things together. while i can see that there are plot twists galore everything isn't spelled out like it is in my american thillers. the end had a bit of a david lynch feel to it. it's like the audience is supposed to understand the relevance of certain things, but it's not clear how or why. i'm fairly desensitized to gore, and was impressed with with the murder special effects. the movie is well done, just a bit frustrating."
4,had me hooked...,this was a great movie... had me hooked from the opening scene while the tension kept building til the final conclusion of the film...i would recommend this movie to any fans of asian cinema...worth the purchase...gonaa watch it again
4,One of the best horror films to come out of Asia,"This is a slick and scary movie. It has a great story, beautiful cinematography, and some serious scares. It begins a bit over the top, but it soon settles into being something even more unsettling than just in your face gore. It is very worth watching and easily compares to anything that has come out of Hollywood. If you like giallo or edgy thrillers, this is a great film to check out."
4,very good horror/slasher movie in the vein of copycat,i usually dont fall for foreign horror movies.for the most part they tend to be either too talky and/or cartoonish.theres none of that here.the acting was convincing and the story plausible.my knock against all foreign movies are those annoying subtitles which i hope can be deleted on the dvd version.i highly recommend this.
2,Confusing Mess,"Let me start that this mess could be attributable to the cheesy english overdub. A ""lost-in-the-translation"" problem. But I found this movie to be completely uncomprehendable for the last 45 minutes or so. Why did the detective end up in that alley? I don't recall him ""following a lead"". Who owned the video editing office? What happened to the young initial suspect? What was the signifigance of the ""window"" guy? Why did her girlfriend want to ......? What did the photo ""explain""? I'll watch it again and see if things get clearer. But, my initial reaction is ""confusing mess""."
4,Hannibul Lecter Goes Korean,"When people of medicine go bad - they really go bad, as they have all the skills, intelligence and tools to do the unimaginable. That is what makes this film reminiscent of ""Silence of the Lambs"" as surgically cut body parts start showing up all over the city and the police race against the clock to solve the crime. They narrow it down to a few suspectsand there is a double-twist ending as to who the real killer is.It all ends with the the same ironic ending as ""Silence of the Lambs"" too. Good stuff."
2,The title's more interesting,"A slogging whodunnit that might have been made in this country or France or who knows where else. Contains a lot of body parts and blood, a troubled detective, a shell shocked potential victim and lotsa lotsa questioning. But the logic is hazy and its denouement way too predictable.It's hard to believe that the two main actors were the two in the warm and touchingCHRISTMAS IN AUGUSTjust the year before. Han Suk Kyu appears dramatically different here as the weary detective -- and he's the one that holds the film together since the story's logic doesn't.I found it interesting that the Korean movie title is not a Korean phrase altho it is written in Hangeul. Try pronouncing it: ""tel mi seom ding""."
3,A bit dull for a propeller reamer,"A prop reamer is necessary to fit a prop to your model plane's engine or motor prop shaft. Since this diameter varies, especially with electric motors, the prop reamer needs to have several steps of different diameters. Using a drill could offset or angle the hole in the prop, which would cause significant vibration and could damage bearings or even tear the motor off its mount.What I didn't like about this particular reamer is that it's fairly dull, and made with relatively soft metal. I've used better. I intent to replace it with a Great Planes metric prop reamer, which I hope will be superior to this one. The Great Planes prop reamer also has a removable T-handle, allowing it to be chucked into a drill press for even better accuracy. Both Fox Manufacturing and Great Planes have reamers in various sizes, in SAE and metric."
4,A REAL good read,"I found this extremely well-researched novel to be a real page-turner. History and fiction are interwoven in a subtle drama that leaves the reader entirely engaged in the action -- this would make a great movie or mini-series, as the characters are real, breathing examples of humanity (or the lack thereof!). I recommend this novel."
4,Love jumping,I went from the beginner Ropesport DVD straight to the Advanced and am glad I did. I was having to replay the beginner DVD at least 3 times to get the results I wanted. The workout on this DVD is longer and has some fun (new to me) exercises; that I'm still trying to master. I love it I can get my heart rate up and keep it up as long as I want or slow down and not miss a beat. I definatley recommend this after you've mastered the beginner DVD.
1,"unfortunately, didn't like this so much","Thought I would as I'm not like most ordinary people - love jumprope. But there was definitely too much talking.Also there should be more options provided if you're:a. not in possession of a jump-rope, or can't use it where you are for some reasonb. not picking up the moves as quicklyc. more advanced movesI'll use it every now and then - not a total loss!"
1,Don't waste your money.,This went straight into the trash.I buy many workout dvds and this was the worst one I have ever seen.
3,too little apparent effort,"Just because someone poetically bares his soul about addiction and recovery does not ipso facto mean the expression of baring is of poetic value. To be sure, there are some striking phrases, and Wright's ability to ""turn on a dime"" as the jacket states is evident. But so much of this stuff seems as though it never got past the first draft, as though pieces of conversation were stenographed, cut up and put on the page to look like poetry rather than like prosaic ordinaria."
5,"Great case, for more than just a camera!","I needed a case to hold a wireless card (Mi-Fi) and power adapter, big enough to fit both, but not too small that I was cramming everything in. This does a great job. You could put a lot of different products in here, such as a small, medium, or medium-large camera, binoculars, even a small video camera inside. It is great quality and has a belt option in case you want to secure it to your body to keep you hands free. You could also use it purse style to carry on your shoulder, or cross your chest. Great choice."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I found the writing self-righteous and sensationalistic. Really a disappointing waste of time. I thought I'd find something worth gleening by reading his experience...but in the light of what has happened in the US of late, I found this book distastful. I bought this book at my local bookstore and am returning it post haste!!! Don't waste your money!"
1,PSYCHOS WITH PRETTY WHITE FACES,"TO THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE WILL MAKE MONEY OFF THIS HOGWASH IS VERY DISTURBING. THE AUTHOR GOES ON AND ON ABOUT HOW ""RIGHT"" HE WAS TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES - WITHOUT MENTIONING THE PEOPLE HE HURT BY HIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. BUT WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME, IS HIS MEMORY OF A 1981 ROBBERY WHERE 3 INNOCENT MEN WERE KILLED IN COLD BLOOD - THE AUTHOR DOESN'T EVEN CALL IT A ROBBERY - BUT A WAY TO GET MONEY FOR THE CAUSE. FURTHERMORE, HE GOES ON AND ON ABOUT THE HORROR OF SPECIAL RIGHTS OF WHITES OVER BLACKS, BUT FAILS TO MENTION THAT IN THE TRIAL OF THE 1981 ROBBERY KILLERS, THE BLACK ACTIVISTS GOT 75 YEARS TO LIFE, BUT KATHY BOUDIN - A WHITE FRIEND OF THE AUTHOR - PLEA BARGAINED WITH THE HELP OF HER WHITE DADDY LAWYER AND ONLY GOT 20 YEARS AND IS NOW OUT ON PAROLE. DID SHE HELP HER BLACK FELLOW ACTIVISTS? HELL, NO. WHAT HYPRICATES!!!"
1,I've rarely had such a (bad) reaction to a book,"Rarely do I have such a reaction to a book as I've had towards this one. Being someone who opposed the Vietnam War, my expectations were that it would be an enjoyable read - not a book I'd come to loathe.Bill Ayers does a good job of taking his readers back to the chaos of that time in the early chapters of his book. And I congratulate him on his unswerving honesty towards himself and his cadre of comrades. But he is such detestable, manipulative, whiny, self-righteous holier-than-thou person that I suddenly see a lot more legitimacy in the words, ""Love it or leave it.""I completely lost tolerance for him at the end when he brings up My Lai yet another time in the book and then asks when America will acknowledge the sacrifice Diana made toward ending the war - Diana who blew herself up or was blown up by another in their gang while planning to bomb a target in the US.I wish I could rate this book zero stars. I wish I could get my money back."
1,"Politics aside, not much of a read","The book starts with a disclaimer that it ""feels true enough,"" so immediately the veracity of Ayers' account is in question. What is he omitting? Is this a definitive account or a self-justification?I always have a problem with self-indulgent writing and over-long childhood recounting. This book has both, not to mention italicized asides that add nothing to the narrative. Certain passages of the book are fascinating (the underground, Days of Rage), but the rest is mostly dull. Ayers rhapsodizes about those things he is passionate about, mostly his hope for a North Vietnamese victory, his hatred of American arrogance and oppression (as he sees it), and getting laid. I found his style ponderous, and his sketchy recounting of events frustrating. He had an opportunity to breathe life in an important and fascinating period of our country, and, perhaps because he was too close to the action, didn't quite deliver. I lost interest well before the book ended."
1,A first cousin of bin Laden,"Ayers is a self-described terrorist who carefully avoids the use of that word in his puerile memoirs. But make no mistake- he is closely related to bin Laden and all other terrorists in history who use violence to advance political positions. While he may bristle at the use of the terrorist label now, Ayers is proud of his use of bombs and violence in the book.It would be a shame to give this terrorist money through royalties from sales of this piece of garbage and self-justifying trash."
1,fugitive days,"I decided to read this attempt by Mr. Ayers as I kept hearing about it over the last 6-8 months and I am sixty six and a Woodstock survivor.I tried to get into the work but Mr. Ayers ""revelations"" of the various movements in the 60's were not as depicted in this work. Maybe he tried to relate his experiences in the 70's and retrofit them to make a more interesting work---but alas he failed. I know because I lived the mid-60's to the late 70's in NYC and he is off base...I guess trying to make himself bigger than he was. He is just another one of the ""radicals"" who were a joke to the rest of us. Luckily he survived, migrated to Chicago and used his family's influence to get a job. Bill. to get a true view, you need to read my book---""Think or Lose Everything"". I look forward to your review."
1,Thouhts of a left wing weasel.,"Bill Ayers is a despicable human being and murderer. The fact that he is still a free man demonstrates the degree to which the ""Hate America"" left operates within this country. Please DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE SELF SERVING MUSINGS OF A TERRORIST. I'm sure he was delighted with the events of 9/11. Probably wishes he'd been involved."
1,A Conservative Says Thanks...,"For a political conservative like myself, there is no better propaganda than people like Billy Ayers. An unrepentant terrorist who spent much of the late 1960s and early 1970s planting bombs around the country attempts to explain how the Vietnam War made him do it. As a teacher of college undergraduates, I find this work invaluable as a depiction of an important (if often whitewashed) face of the New Left. (My low rating is based on an estimate of the intrinsic worth of the book; its social/political utility is far greater.)"
4,Let's you be there now!,"My Ayers book is an excellent memoir of the times.He captuers the flavor of SDS and the Weatherman exactly as it was for those of us who lived it. There is little in the way of analysis and apologizes here, and that is as it should be. This book does not attempt place the past in the context of today. It is a memoir and as such has no need to do that.If you want to want to experience the feelings just as they were in those days then this is the best book to date on the subject. It move at the same pace as the events did or at least felt like they were moving at the time."
1,Weathermen continue under cover,"Fugitive DaysThe new looks of Radical Weathermen are as ""Distinguished Professors"" and Legal Clinic Directors. Ayers makes the limp excuse after the WTC bombing that ""..we are witnessing crimes against humanity"" to distinguish his and Dohrn's actions from those of later day bombers. Isn't that what his bombings of police stations, the Pentagon, and Capitol building represented? Were these lives less important to their families? One thing we've learned in the last few days is that people can blend into our society and then resurface as terrorists. How do we know that Ayers and Dohrn aren't waiting for their next destructive opportunities, and certainly use their positions of trust to do further damage to society?The University of Illinois and Northwestern University should reexamine their standards for those who can corrupt the minds of our young people."
2,A little thin,"I picked up ""Fugitive Days"" hoping to get an insider's account of life as a fugitive and an explanation of those days. Maybe Ayers' own admission that memory is shaky and not entirely trustworthy should have been a hint to me. I found little of what I was looking for. I find the title misleading. Only about one-third of the book is about his days as a fugitive and the description of that time is vague. He doesn't even describe how they finally turned themselves in. I didn't get a clear idea of who the other members of the Weathermen were and how they interacted with each other. He and Diana Oughton loved each other, but I don't get a sense of that love. He uses the book mostly to expound upon the ideas of that time and his ideas now. Definitely not a straight autobiography; more of a philosophical rant."
5,wow,I burned through this book -- couldn't put it down. It's an amazing and fast-paced story - it's hard to believe it really happened. The fact that it's a history text and I learned tons seems like a bonus! Thanks for the great read! When's the movie coming out???
1,"Young bomber, not dreamer","Sanctimonious piece of garbage from from the [name] of his day...no, he was worse, he wanted to kill his own...and now he wants us to see what a martyr he and his ilk were and make money off it to boot. ... this book, then burn it. And don't miss Stud's ""glowing young dreamer who tried to live elegantly"" nauseating cover blurb..."
4,True background to why France's forces melted away,"It is an excellent background to why France fell so cheaply.Details clearly the confusion after 1918, the pacifism, communism, rising prices, boredom, spineless politicians (Gamelin is a politician)."
3,Required,I didn't realize that I had not reviewed this item. It was written in a way that kept my attention on this required reading book.
3,Kindle Version,"My big concern is with the Kindle Version. The ""zoom"" aspect that allows one to expand and see the maps doesn't work; a technician from Amazon said that is the responsibility of the publisher. Being able to utilize the maps to appreciate the text is very important in a war history book and not being able to see them(too small on the Kindle) leaves the reader at a big disadvantage.I would not recommend the Kindle version for this reason alone. Amazon should not allow a Kindle version that doesn't meet the zoom standards or should at least tell its customers before buying that the ""zoom"" feature is not available."
1,Would a mother like this?,Just curious if a women who chose to have children and live a married life might find this book at all interesting????
1,MISSING IN ACTION!!,"I thought I was buying a tape with 2 45 minute segments--Split Routine 2-Toning. Imagine my surprise to find it contained a different tape-""Hips, Abs, and Arms Toning""--which I had already purchased.(very good, by the way) It seems the wrong tape was placed in the box, although the box and tape were titled correctly.This is a first for me. Anyone else with the same situation?PS. I had to rate this with a star, as there is no provision for no stars."
5,A little too big for the Canon EF 70-300 mm lens,"I have used several Lowepro camera cases in the past and I was looking for a protective case for my Canon EF 70-300 mm IS lens, so I bought this case. Unfortunately, the case is too big for that lens, probably because I don't have a lens hood. Otherwise, the case is excellent. It has a nice thick layer of padding and is very sturdy and I would say that the case is a pretty good value. Your lenses are definitely very safe in it! The case is Made in China."
3,"Outdated, biased toward Commonwealth teachers of English","Seven years ago, the book would have been much more useful, but many of the contacts listed have gone out of business. I did manage to mine a few gems, however.The book is highly idiosyncratic, which is itself not an argument against it. However - this will sound harsh - it's oriented to the young Canadian, Aussie, or Kiwi recent college graduate with a useless liberal arts degree, whose only real prospects for employment here are teaching English to people who won't learn it, or the would-be gaijin model or club hostess.For someone who ostensibly spent a few years here as of the writing of the book, Gauthier dwells unnecessarily on ""strange foods"" few of us consider strange. Most of the anecdotes are of the tired ""culture shock"" variety more appropriate to a traveller back in the 60's or 70's.Stick to fj.life.in-japan."
3,Interesting title but didnt find a lot of substance,"I am into these type of books and enjoy the motivation involved usually but didnt find a lot of meat here. It is an okay book but found the points made obvious and had to make myself keep reading. I have a personal policy of finishing every book I start so I kept going and found it just okay to me. The strategies of doubt the obvious, know yourself and stay on course ... just didnt ring my bell but then maybe its just me."
2,Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal DVD Set,"I was expecting a story, not another ghost hunter type thing. Do not go by my thoughts though, if you are into boring real life (??) watch and enjoy. I will not be waisting any more money!!!!!!!!"
5,Coffey,Chip Coffey is an amazing psychic. These episodes show how isolating it can be for a child. I really like the way the parents are counseled so they are not feeling as isolated as they once were. What a cool subject for a show. I just wish there were more episodes. Kudos to Chip!!!
3,Another 6th Sense documentary,"Some of the kids are very psychic, meaning they can sense apparation and messages from another dimension, human and animal spirits, human's aura, supernatural healing ability, premonitions, etc. But some of them just merely victim of the ghost sighting, or simply having creative imagination. But overall, not so many documentary about supernatural can be easily found and made, so any collection in this category should be given credit above than average."
4,Not the only one,"I agree with the previous review. One episode (disc 2), is seriously out of audio/video sync, preventing me from giving this otherwise excellent set 5 stars."
4,A great critical view on Egypt and technogracy,"The work of Mitchell is impressive. The book is critically looking at the making of today's Egypt and deconstructing completely the myths that are attached to the Arab Republic. The anti-mosquito campaign, the Asswan dam, overpopulation and land ownership systems are few of the topics tackled and looked at in depth by the researcher. This is an amazing insight in the mechanisms that made Egypt as it is today, and the involvement of the West (US and Europe) in the form of 'technical help' or development aid (US AID) that Mitchell is not afraid of calling interference. A great book!"
5,Rule of Experts Fantastic!,"I received Rule of Experts in adequate time and great condition. Nothing out of the ordinary , just regular wear and tear. I love it when books already have highlighting in them and this copy was great."
5,OPERATION: DUMMKOPF,"I like Jake Page.. Hay, don't call me.. I mean I like his schreiben (writing). At first I thought ""what a dummkopf idea, but the more I read, the more I liked it and understood it. You see when Rommel was kicking esel in North Africa there was this British Major who lead a very small group of Desert Rats (remember the TV show ?) in hit and run warfare that had Rommel about nuts. Well, keep that in mind and Jake's book is easy to understand. But the Germans are lead by Herr Major General Heinrich Schalberg, a real schlemiel. Tonto sends word to FDR, 'Fritz is here', FDR (as he did with MacArther in Manilla,) replies...'hold the fort, help on the way' then he send one guy. Sure Frank. Well General schemiel has this real (censored)hole Sergeant who beat an Indian runner into a Big Mac. Now the boys are hot. The rest you'll have to read, a great ending. Hope to see more Alt. History from Jake Page."
4,"Great shoe, bad fit",I'm normally a 7 1/2 but I was advised to get a 7. I bought the 7 and they are still too big. I can't walk in them without my heels slipping out. The front of the shoe where the leaf is is pretty tight. I got a lot of great compliments all day.
5,"Body Sold Leg Curl, Leg Extension GLCE365","I was real hesitant about this purchase since the only two reviews on here about it seem to be negative. The first seems more of a problem with the actual 3rd party vendor not the product itself. As too the second, he reviews the product as unstable and shakey. I decided not to purchase online because of this but did decide to go to a local gym equipment store to view for myself. I was pleasently surprised, the machine is built super tough and as sturdy as can be. I'm not sure what problems the other reviewer is seeing but this thing is commerical grade and tough enough to go in any public gym. As with all the other Body Solid equipment I've purchased so far, it is an excellent addition to my gym. Again this review is for the product itself, not the vendor that might be selling it."
1,Be Very Careful!,"I purchased the product in the picture, but I received an inferior product. The vendor refused to take the product back. I am now stuck with the inferior product. I would not purchase anything from this vendor!!!"
2,"Great music, bad mastering","This is a wonderful collection of tunes, but it is mastered at a very low level. I have to crank the volume up to get to typical listening levels. That just ain't cool; many details in the music are lost. Re-master this and it's easily five stars. (NB: I am aware of the loudness wars. I'm not suggesting this should be remastered in the compressed super-loud-overly-saturated fashion that many modern recordings are mastered in. It's just a very quiet CD, even compared with the various CDs I bought in the 1980s.)"
5,great starter set for the new kinks fan,"this set covers the period that is by general consensus the kinks most creative period although not their most commercially successful. beginning to end this two cd set goes from strength to strength. highlighing most of the standout tracks from the kinks mid to late sixties albums and singles. several of these songs were hits in britain while obscure here in the states. several reviewers have criticized the sound quality of this set, and they make a valid point as the sound is decidedly murky. the songs are so great and the selections so well representing the peak of the kinks work, that i can forgive the technical shortcomings of this package and still give it 5 stars. so start with this set then move on to arthur, village green preservation society, something else, and lola and you are on your way to joining the kinks preservation society."
5,2 hours of bliss,"You will never know how awesome the late 1960's era Kinks were until you listen to the treasure trove of material on this cd. What a great band, capable of so many styles! Ray Davies is such a great song writer, Dave Davies always played the perfect chord/riff. It is silly to single out songs b/c this is essentially a greatest hit/should have been hit package. I love Shangra La, everything off of Lola/Moneygoround, waterloo sunset and the punkish ""she's got everything""If your a casual Kinks fan, this is the one to get. If you want to get an introduction, this is also perfect.They were a different band in the late 70's and 80's."
3,Older version was better,"I have two older versions of this case from about 6 years ago. They were much better.The problem is that the new cases are made in China and they just to not seem as robust or ""over built"". There is one less surround strap.The worst thing is that the foam smells like a chemical factory or toxic waste, nothing in the older version. I had to air these cases out for two weeks in my garage to get to the point where I could use them. I was also afraid that the fumes could also infiltrate my lenses and damage the optical glass.I am tired of Chinese products that mimic older made in the USA. The Chinese stuff is junk.What is Lowe Pro thinking?Rudi"
2,Poor design concept,"It appears to be good quality although I cannot judge how it works under wear and tear. I bought the case 4s and it is monstrous, it has too much padding. In addition, the waist belt (size large), and I have waist 34"", covers only the back from hip bone to hip bone. So the lens cases would be hanging on the back when I want the buckles in front of the body. This will make it extremely awkward to get a lens out and in from the back, including operating the zipper. In my view, waist belt, body harness and lens case from Loewepro is from the concept a very poor design. Not made for photographers who need quick access to lenses and who do not want to be subject of laughter by the monstrous appearance this system provides. The unpadded lens cases that came with the lens are much smaller and I will modify them to attach to a self designed waist belt and suspender type harness."
4,"A falling off from season one and two, but...","I concur with the reviewer who rates this as one of the low points from the TZ years with perhaps only season 4 finishing behind it. Roughtly 1/3 of the 37 episodes from season 3 rise to the caliber of excellence established in the first two seasons. Much of the writing from this season (e.g., Piano in the House; The Mirror; The Grave;) is a bit insipid and minus the unforgettable irony permeating seasons 1 and 2. This said, even the weakest episodes from season 3 are superior to much of what passes for good TV today and worth owning, particularly if, like me, you are an inveterate fan of the TZ, a well aged and enormously mesmerizing show."
4,An episode about the tragedy and loss of life from war,"Twilight Zone had many episodes featuring people coming to awareness that they no longer exist and people coming back after death to interact with the living. Among those, this episode might be the most drawn out and over-reaching. It ended with a visit from a famous person - I cannot say more without a spoiler alert.Part of the purpose of this episode, I suspect, was to teach some history of the Civil War and make the tragedy real to the audience. I cannot imagine anything remotely like this being shown on cable now because I think it's too slow-moving, sad and lacking in any action compared to what viewers now experience."
5,AWESOME!,"The twilight zone is heavily based on the metaphysical outcomes of quantum physics, relativity and psychology. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is cristal clear (notice how some episodes looked like they were filmed with a handycam). I won't have to wait for the sci-fi channel marathons to watch them now. Overall: EXCELLENT!"
1,Blu-Ray arrived without shrink wrap...,"I received my Season Three Blu Ray this afternoon, and I was disappointed to see that the Blu-Ray had no plastic wrap on it. It looks like it has already been opened. I received Batman Begins in the same shipment, and it had wrap on it. Now I'm wondering if this set was returned by someone and they just turned around and sent it to me. At first I thought I would try the discs to see if they play, but I just don't think that's cool. For Fifty bucks I don't think I should be getting a second hand set, even if it is in good condition. I think i will be returning this set and see what they send in it's place. Very disappointed.... The one star is strictly for the fact that it came unwrapped, not for the show itself."
2,Prices are jumping!,"Well u would know what to expect if you are buying this.For some strange reason, for the same product that amazon was previously selling for about $30 USD, it has doubled last month and other sellers' prices continue to go up too!Whats up with that!If you havent bought any of the seasons, buy the complete collection.Otherwise, its best to act early before everything becomes high priced.Negative review for the listings in amazon, but yes its good product."
2,Fairly boring...,"I ordered this episode on a whim, for free, when Amazon's UnBox service was just starting out. I'm torn on Twilight Zone: Some are great and some are not so great. This episode, The Arrival, was kind of a boring one. Not enough sci-fi stuff to hold my interest, and nothing really ""out there"" in terms of the story or the twist. The ending didn't do much for me, either... All in all, nothing special."
5,"Rod Serling's Classic ""Zone""","This classic is a bit dated, but still fascinating. I love the DVDs and love the speedy, excellent service from the seller."
3,The plot got mixed up in production,"Don't go by the graphic associated with this episode - the graphic belongs to the previous episode.The Arrival started the idea of group think and tried to relate it to the idea of finding yourself returned from the dead as another person 17 years later. To be clear, Twilight Zone made errors in producing this piece but they didn't apparently have the ability to fix the problem on time. Note that this flawed episode was shown just after one of their best episodes and just before another of their best episodes ever."
3,Mystery of Flight 107,"Thumbs neither up nor down. Written by Rod Serling is the tale of an arriving flight without a crew or passengers. The mystery is the story and there is not much of the usual twist in this story. I suppose you can't win them all and hence, this is just an average T-Zone."
1,Would never buy again.,"After about 2 month's use, I decided to replace this Remo practice pad.Using this practice pad defeats the purpose of even using a pad, because it sounds almost as loud as the snare. There is hardly any bounce to the pad either. I will not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Hard to know,"I thought this book would give me good ideas about a desert garden. Yes, it named and pictured the plants but I wanted a design for a garden and it was no help there"
5,excellent book,"Ms. Chatto's writing style is eloquent and poetic along with informative. As the maker of a new gravel garden myself, this book was the perfect manual to help with ideas."
3,Common sense will do...,"This book is just ""ok"" because most of the content is really common sense. You can basically just scan through this book and get the jist. It might be good for someone who really has no clue what they're doing but if can use common sense, don't waste your money."
3,"Holiday Order a Delivery Problem, Product Great","On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving we decided to make some old fashioned fudge requiring dutch process cocoa. Unfortunately, rather than phone, I ordered by email and paid for next day delivery. It turned out the small supplier was closed until the following Monday when it was shipped for next day delivery and it arrived Tuesday. Monday was the latest delivery date we could use the ingredient for that cooking session. We were able to purchase enough product from a local bakery to get us through, so it all worked out. The moral is the web may run 24/7 but the folks on the other end may not! Otherwise it was a good transaction."
3,Battery not that great. Chargers work all right.,The chargers take longer to charge the phone than my original one. Battery doesn't hold a charge as long either. But it gets the job done.
4,Great Product for the Money,"Great Product for the price! The battery is a heavier and thicker than the Verizon battery but well worth the money!! Also the battery is not as snug as it should be but again, you can't beat the price!"
1,Beware!!!,"This CD-ROM is NOT compatible with Windows. I just got it and it won't work. I am trying to find a way to replace it through the publisher. The publishers site says there is a replacement, but no one should have to go through this trouble. Amazon should list that it isn't compatible. I'm sure it is a great CD-ROM, but I may never know. On top of that, Amazon will only refund 50% of the price because I removed the plastic wrap, even though I wouldn't have known it didn't work if I hadn't opened it.The back of the CD case says it is Windows compatible...but it is not. It's MAC compatible, but that's it!!!"
1,"Ordered Hard Cover, Sent Paper Back","I already own a paper back version of this book. The merchant advertised this as a hard cover book. Over priced for an old paper back, and not something I have any need for."
5,Perfect,"This bag is perfect for me. I shoot with a Canon 5D and a set of 'L' primes, and typically my F-4 takes the camera with lens mounted in the main section, with a flashgun in one of the smaller sections, as well as 1-2 lenses. The external pockets take off-camera flash cord, waterproof jacket, etc. It's a wonderfully discreet bag - anything larger you'd want to move to something more along the lines of a waistpack, proper backpack or roller bag to save your shoulders."
1,Not the Item Shown,"Was looking for a long RCA cable to run in my RV for a rear view camera, saw the picture and thought this is what I need. After receiving the product was extremely disappointed, the quality of the cable was less than the mass produced cable you get with almost any home electronics device yet this cable was of worse quality. I needed to get my camera back up and running ASAP so I dropped the cable on the ground to test and see if it would do until I could properly replace. It was worse than I thought it would be. Yes I got video from the camera but there was so much interference that you almost couldn't make out anything. This was just lying on the ground I would hate to see if the cable had been routed through 26 feet of frame along with almost every other cable in the RV. Buy something else if you want quality of any kind."
2,"It works, but the quality is poor","This cable is running from my UVerse box to my projector across the room. The picture is slightly misleading, as it appears as if the cable is relatively thick; however, the cable is quite thin.Pro:The picture works, and is in color.The cable is 50 feet long, and thin enough to tuck easily between the carpet and the wall.The price.Con:There are diagonal grey lines (faint) running across the screen no matter how much I ""futz"" with the connection. These lines do not appear with my previous video cable (which was too short to run along my apartment wall, out of the way). This is the first thing anyone notices while watching TV at my apartment.Overall, pleased with the price and that it works. Displeased with the quality of the video produced."
2,Not quite as advertised,I was really disappointed to open the package and find the cable looked nothing like the pictures. It was way way thinner than the pictures showed. It functioned fine but in our venue was in constant danger of being trampled. You get what you pay for not what the picture shows with this one...
2,not recommended,"Don't like me this productThe wire gauge is very thin, and yet not tested and may not work properlyThanks"
1,Buyer be ware,"What I recieved is not what is pictured here OR ADVERTIZED, but it is a vidio cable, and it does do the job I needed it for. If you were looking for a high quality cable do not buy this product. I recieved a cheap thin flimsy cable that is not gold plated or anything else they claim here. Bait and Switch? or a mistake in the order !!!!! . I do not know. I will attempt to contact the sender and find out. I contacted the seller and they told me to contact amazon.com so i did, and amazon.com was good enough to give me a $4.00 refund; which is good, because all this cable is woth is $2 to $3. I only needed it to run my wife's kareokee to the TV. If it was for any thing else I would have sent it back for a full refund. I'm surprised that this item is still listed as a high grade cable."
1,WARNING: FRAUDULENT ITEM!!!,"If you need a video cable that is shielded and is made using quality materials LOOK ELSEWHERE! The cable I received isn't even the one pictured. It's a cheap little audio wire that is totally useless for my needs. I usually read the reviews before buying, I wished I would have on this one 'cause it appears I'm not the only one deceived by these folks."
5,High Quality,With the low price you worry that the quality of the cable may not be all that good. This is a high quaulity cable. I imagine the low demand for composite cables in this age of HDMI results in the low price.
5,Works great,Great cable that appears shielded from RF interference. Works great. Replaced one of another brand that I had been using and that had a broken connection within the cable. Fast shipping from this seller minimized down time.
2,Not as pictured,"The RCA cable looked nothing like the image. The image makes it look like a high quality cable, yet when it arrived, it was just a basic, low-end cable."
1,Item is NOT the one pictured.,"I ordered this cable twice thinking maybe it was an honest mistake the first time. However, the second one was exactly the same. It is a cheap, thin cable without the gold plated conductors and does not send a quality video signal. I returned the second purchase. Both the picture and description are wrong and should be corrected."
1,Male / Male RCA Cable,The product that I received was what I ordered but did not match the picture advertised. The picture advertisement is deceiving as a quality item. When connecting the cable to the electronics quality of the picture was sub par. I do not hold the buyer at fault as they delivered the RCA cable in great time. I rated this 1 star because of the price and delivery but you do get what you pay for.
1,Inferior,"Not at all as pictured or described at Amazon. This is a cheap rca audio cable not capable of sending quality video content. Don't waste your time & money.RCA Male / RCA Male, High Quality, Composite Video Cable, 50 ft[[ASIN:B000HDJXNA RCA Male / RCA Male, High Quality, Composite Video Cable, 50 ft"
1,Don't buy,This product is a poor quality cable and I do not recommend it to anyone.To sum it up totally false advertising.
5,"Just what I needed and at a good price,, thanks","Good stuff at good price,, RCA Male / RCA Male, High Quality, Composite Video Cable, 50 ft,, kind of hard to write 20 words on vidio cable that works great and does the job well. recieved fast and thanks"
1,"Defective product, different from one pictured","The only thing right about this was the length. The product did not work. The picture was extremely fuzzy, and would short out. I replaced this cable with an actual high quality cable and the picture was crystal clear."
2,Useless,"This cable is really awful. It is much skinnier than I expected (I should have known given the price). With a cable this long, you lose way too much quality with such a low gauge cable. Video quality is really awful. I used this to connect my digital antenna to my HD projector, and a very blurry picture was produced. I cannot imagine using this; I got a higher gauge cable immediately and everything looked great. I should have known the price was too good to be true, but it really is.If you need a really long cable with a fuzzy picture, this is your product. I can't imagine that use, but maybe it's for someone."
1,"Poor product, not as pictured/described","This is a very poor product. It in no way resembles the item that was pictured and definitely not ""high quality"" This is probably one of the smallest gauge wires for a video cable that I have ever used. The signal quality was very poor. I expected some degradation fo the video quality due to the length of the cable, but this was not even functional as the image was so poor. Very misleading description and absolutely poor product DO NOT BUYI am not sure how this can be sold as pictured/described and then something completely different and sub par can be delivered."
2,videographer,"I returned this product because the Composite Video Cable I received did not match the picture on the web site.They looked and had the feel of very poor quality.Previous, I purchased this cable from a different seller and I am very please with it to say the least.Would not recommend this seller until the product ship match the picture on the web site."
5,1 of the best,Most informative of the 15 or so books I have read on striped bass covers everthing!!!
4,Delicious Ginger candy!,This candy is so yummy! There is 20% real ginger root in the candy and that gives it a lot of kick! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the wrappers are so annoying and that you spend way too much time fighting to free the candy from the wrapper.
3,Pricey but delicious,"I love these things but the price is outrageous. Is there a way to buy in bulk, at a significant savings? I need these to help with medications to help calm my stomach. But there has to be a more economical way to do this. Any ideas?"
5,A terrific product,We have purchased The Ginger Peoples Original Ginger Chews several times. Shipments are always prompt and the chews are top quality product. A great product.
5,"Delicious candies, good for people with motion sickness","My wife, my daughter and I all have motion sickness. I keep these candies in our cars, and bring them along when we travel. They are delicious and they calm the nauseous feeling. They freshen your breath, too. I highly recommend these."
5,Back cover photo says it all,Take a look at the back cover photo - it says it all about the music and musicians on this record. This is an absolutely fantastic record.Danny Whitten was a great songwriter and singer and a tragic loss.
4,Eh.,Well it was okay. I didn't get much of it but it was a good book. I thought only some parts were interesting.
2,So-so at best,"I may be kind of sick of books about NYC or the book just plain deserves a low rating. Unlikable characters, no story/no plot, so-so writing."
2,Superficial,"The New Yorker in me loved the cover, and I was excited to read the book, but the characters and the story didn't come close to equalling the cover's promise. There were brief moments toward the beginning of the book where I was almost interested, but I had lost any interest by the time Roz and Edwin separated. The characters were so thinly portrayed that I didn't care what happened to them."
2,The good people of New York deserve a better story,"I had high hopes for this book, but in the end it was quite a let down. The writing, which started out very good, would just kind of trail off. Storylines that might have been original were left hanging there... in the end making them unoriginal and boring. I think this could have been a great story about interesting characters in New York (that in and of itself should be interesting) and yet this was a forced series of narratives that had nothing to do with the city. The main character is one you end up having no sympathy for.I had heard the author describe this story as ""a love letter to the city of New York"" and actually it is quite the opposite."
2,"Okay, I guess.","I liked reading bits of this book, which seemed to work fine because the novel was put together in bits. Nissen uses way, way, WAY too many adjectives (and particularly adverbs) to describe the most simple objects and actions, so in that's she's definitely showing off, character's voice or not. I wasn't convinced by how each of the characters fit together and, in the end, I felt no sympathy or empathy for any of them. Typically, I enjoy any novel that describes NYC street for street: it's one of the most relaxed, warm feelings I have, imagining I'm in Manhattan. Nissen did okay with that. What she didn't do so well with was the time period: I felt like she was making fun of the 70s (or was it the 60s?) retro fashions instead of putting us there firsthand. Overall, okay. Don't expect to feel as though you've accomplished anything reading this book, but it can be fun if you pick it up at random."
2,"Good plot, writing lacking","Nissen does a good job of fleshing out the characters in this book, and they are ""good people"" who you enjoy following on their journey. The writing lacked any luster, though, and by the second half I was skimming in parts, more interested in what would happen to these characters than in the writing. Nissen often resorts to cliches and her dialogue can be a bit too studied. Having lived in NYC, I was hoping the city would be more of a character in the book. Although Nissen captured the ""growing up fast"" that happens to kids raised in New York, it could have been any urban setting. I'd hesitate to recommend this book. It wasn't horrible, but there wasn't much to make it stand out."
3,How I feel about Thisbe Nissen's Novel Which I am Reading,"This book was not he the best book I read, but I have read worse. Although I felt that this book takes a little time to get into, I am enjoying it. Thisbe Nissen's story is very comical, and her sense of humor is fantastic."
2,"i have long hair, read me!","Let me give you the scoop on Thisbe Nissan. I am a student of the Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa. Before I came I made it apoint to read everyone's books. I have not had Thisbe Nissan as a teacher and I have not even seen her around except just at a reading. But this is what I think. Good People of NYC is a novel of adolescence. The character's are well formed, but they are characters that no one would want to ever know. They are childish and it shows just how little this writer knows about the real world. This book is not worth buying. Don't even borrow it from a library. Nissan's first collection suggested that there might be something interesting to come from this writer., but with this work she has failed."
3,US Paratrooper1941-45,"First the good news. The graphics/drawing in the book are very good. The art work of the weapons and equipmnet utilized by the paratroopers is excellent. Several of the pictures (all B/W) are new and not seen on a regular basis. The problem is with the written portion. As you read through the book you will find that several paragraphs have eiher been omitted or repeated. This is very frustrating. As you begin to read about a specific issue it will suddenly end or be repeated. I could not find the remainder of article. It appears that the publisher was in a rush to get this book out and did a poor job of editing. If you want a book for references on uniforms, weapons and equipment this is a good book. If you want to read about the paratoopers adventures I would look else where. This is not one of Osprey's best works."
2,Extremely hard to understand!,"I understand why it works because I am very familiar with other low carb diets and I understand the insulin and all the other stuff, but what confuses me big time is the thing about zone blocks and measurements. That totally throws it all off for me. If I could only understand it. It sounds like a great diet and I'm sure it is, but it's too complicated to understand for most people..."
3,Par,The book was not in the best condition but it was a used book and you can't expect a book in great condition when it's used.
1,Readers please beware of fad diets!!!,"Diets such as the zone diet do not exhibit balanced nutrition as is found in the food guide pryamid. Adding too much protein to one's diet, as the book suggests, takes away from the carbohydrates that are a necessary part of our diet-- it is from carbs that we get our energy!!! It's a lot harder for our body to get energy from protein!!!"
4,an informative read,"The Zone is a logical approach to healthy eating. I really wouldn't call it a diet in the sense that diets have a negative connotation about them, but this is more of hybridized way to eat, be healthy and lose a few pounds. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to live a healthier lifestyle. 3,2,1, GO!!"
4,Comprehensive and helpful,"Mastering the Zone gives the shortened explanation of the Zone diet. The purpose of the book is not to explain the details of the science behind diet (which is covered in The Zone), the purpose is to introduce a brief overview and then provide an abundance of recipes and food examples that fit within the confines of the diet. Sears accomplished both, and also adds a Q&A; to address any issues one might having trying to follow the diet.Many reviewers of this book have spent their time rating the diet which I have deliberately avoided. My review is based on the content of the book, and thus this book rates well independent of whether you find this diet a success or not."
3,"A great read, 2 complaints though!!!","Mastering the zone made for a brillinat read. I understand exactly why a person should be eating in the zone. However calculating how much protein a person should be consumming according to their LBM is difficult. I've finally calculated that i should be consumming 9 blocks of protein per day. However, the up to date zone website stipulates that everybody should consumme 11 blocks. So i really dont know which source of information to follow. COULD SOMEONE LET ME KNOW PLEASE???????????? Also, I felt that the book didnt cover enough varieties of food in the food block guide at the back and indeed the measurements that it did give were very vague. I'm attempting to start the zone diet and if the success stories are anything to go by, i should manage to lose the weight that i desperately want to get rid of. IF ONLY I COULD KNOW FOR SURE EXACTLY HOW MANY PROTEIN BLOCKS I SHOULD CONSUMME!!!!!Apart from my 2 complaints, the book is a must buy!!!"
3,not for me,"I read the whole book with a skeptical mind, but found that Dr. Sear's theory seems to make sense. He talks about eating small, balanced meals (his idea of balenced is different than the USDA pyramid) throughout the day to maintain you insulin levels so your body is running in it's most efficient state and you're not hungry. While his meals are probably higher in protein than a typical person's diet, this is not a high (read only) protein diet. There are plenty of fruits, veggies, dairy, etc mixed in. Unfortunately, after a few weeks on this diet I was still hungry most of the time and I had a constant upset stomach (probably from eating more protein than I'm used to). Also, it was very time consuming to organize the meals and snacks every day. In short, this seems like a good idea, but it didn't work for me."
4,Very Interesting points - complicated discussions.,"Although Dr. Sears makes some strong points - his micro-biological approach is cumbersome to follow. His idea of eating more protein & fat to balance with the 40% calories from carbohydrate sounds similar to every old adage heard growing up. That is to eat in moderation! Simple one line no complex discussions of hormones, amino acids, insulin, eicohsids.....If you want to lose weight eat a balanced (SMALL) meal three times per day . Simple! and effective."
4,"Better than ""Enter the Zone"", but old","I find this book more helpful about how to follow the Zone diet than the 1995 book ""Enter the Zone"" (see my separate review of that book).The tables of food amounts that make up a ""Zone block"" have not, however, been updated with the new quantities listed in the author's more-recent ""The top 100 zone foods""."
5,"Faith, Motivation, and Sacrifice","It's sad that so many people are unwilling to commit the motivation (read discipline) and sacrifice required to make this eating lifestyle truly effective. Yes, it works, but it comes at a price. Since most of us are conditioned to eating for entertainment and not nutrition, we're unwilling to accept food as fuel and not simply fun. Does it require sacrifice? Absolutely. Many people are offended when in the presence of someone dedicated to a ""radical diet"". Don't give up! Keep the faith and be strong. Your health is too important, and this book is your guide to good health and a more productive life!"
3,Needs a professional narrator!,"This is a 5 star book to be sure; eye-opening information useful for anyone, which is all the more reason to have a professional voice person do the reading for the audio book (Sears reads it himself). I don't know which is worse; the poor articulation, ""A nutrishally fayerible issullin resposs iss possble,"" or the sloberry, amplified sinus and mouth noises. Yuck...Definitely get the book--but pass on the audio version!"
5,Don't read the first book!,"This one is so much more simpler than the original. He gets to the point and you can figure out your blocks and stuff easier too. Written well, but of course over priced. Get a used one if you can. Once you figure out what you need to do the book will just collect dust. I don'e eat anything like some of the meals, but I follow the Zone and I have lost a ton of weight, don't crave as much, and it is apart of how I think about food when I shop and when I eat. Food is fuel. I don't even think about it much; I just do it. I don't exercise except for walking by the way. I eat out all the time but I don't eat near as much and no one really notices or cares. It is cool."
4,Not too shabby!,"The Zone Diet is the first ""diet"" I've ever tried, and so far--two weeks into it--I'm very happy! Lost weight, actually don't feel like I'm starving, even though I only eat about 1200 calories a day on my block plan. Only one downside on this book, the recipes can be pretty bland and sometimes diet-y tasting. If you try them, you will really want to add more spices to make the food taste good. HOWEVER, for great Zone recipes, you can go to the official Zone website at Zoneperfect.com, and they have several hundred ones for free that Zone dieters have sent in. MUCH tastier."
2,Title and abstract are misleading,"When I bought this book, I was looking for info on how to price a photo assignment for sale. The title and short abstract of the book led me to believe this would be a great reference for my purposes. However, when I got the book, the first few paragraphs pointed out that its focus was on assignment stock photography, not for pricing photo assignments in which the finished prints are to be sold to individual clients. If I were submitting stock photos to publishers, it would be a great reference for me. It gets 2 stars only because it didn't suit my purposes at the time."
2,Time for this book to be revised,"There are two major things wrong with this book. The first is that it focused more on stock photography prices and not how to decide how much a photography assignment should pay or be negotiated. Second, look at the date, and look at the date of these other reviews. The digital photography revolution has changed everything, especially stock photography. There's doubts whether anyone will be able to make money from stock unless they are super-specialized, turn themselves into a stock photography factory, i.e., getting a group of photographers to photograph every conceivable office scene and product--and if you turn photography into an assembly line, you may as well do something else. Additionally, photography continues to change at light speed as photoshop wizards six years ago, around 2002, were making six figure salaries, and are now charging $10 per image because of the oversupply of trained people. If there was ever a book that needed an update, this one is it."
3,Outdated,"It was a great guidepost almost a decade ago, but everything - EVERYTHING, has changed since then. The entire business has been changed dramatically by digital photography, micro stock houses and the ongoing recession. I used to recommend this book to my students, but it's virtually impossible to do so now. Pricing photography is a virtual timepiece, a snapshot of the way the photography business used to be."
2,Just OK,Could of had more of the common drinks that are more standard at the bar....for instance a Cosmopolitan made into a Virgin-for a non drinker!
4,an enjoyable and unique romance...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this unusual romance of a woman who seeks the convent because no one wants her and the fallen knight nee' monk who sees that she's special enough to forsake all to be with her.I would have given this book five stars except for the repetitiveness of the idea that the heroine is ""SOOO"" unattractive. That got to be a little annoying after about the 10th time it's mentioned.Very sensual, and overall well written.4 stars!"
4,"Not bad, not great","3.5 stars, this was just okay for me, interesting enough story line, but didn't have that oomph for me.What surprised me was that I actually found I was looking forward to the story line between Adrian and Joanna. I normally prefer it when the story doesn't deviate from the main characters, this was probably the first time I enjoyed the side story and was often more curious about these two minor characters over the main ones."
1,Awful!,"This one rates high amongst the worst books I've ever read. So bad, in fact, that I couldn't even get midway through it. The dialog was far too modern. The plot was ridiculously convoluted and ponderous, full of unbelievable characters and details. One would never know what time period it was except for cover and the talk about crusades, castles and nunneries. I'm tempted to give this author another try just to see if this book is an aberration, but I sure won't recommend this big stinkeroo of a story."
5,From Back Cover,"Independent and headstrong, Elizabeth of Bredon wants only to become a nun, but her journey to the convent of St. Anne's threatens her choice. It's not the escort of holy friars who tempt her, but the man they are taking to do penance for his many sins. Elizabeth has heard whispers about Prince William's treatment of women - the king's only son is a man well schooled in deception, cruelty and murder - yet she cannot entirely resist his charms.But when the journey takes a treacherous turn, masks of deception fall and there is no safe place but in the wicked prince's arms. With treachery drawing near, they are soon racing against time, murderous revenge... and their own sinful desires."
2,ya get what you pay for....,"This item (Cblwhl 2 RCA Male / 2 RCA Male, High Quality Audio Cable, 25 feet) was good for what I paid for them; I was hoping they might be a little bit better than what the price suggested.They are a light weight entry level unshilded cables, not to be confused with high end cables. The next order I picked a cable rated better with a slightly higher price and I did get a better than what the price suggested. Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win, that said there wasn't any negative concerns with this purchase, just a chance I take from time to time... Happy shopping"
5,Great Cable,This cable is very strong and well made. It connects to my stereo with out any problems. A good cable for the price.
5,Great value and good quality,Did an install of a sound system where I was chanelling wires in the walls. I wanted a quality wire and thses did the trick.
4,Memories of Trancy Beats,"I first heard DJ Tomac through AudioGalaxy's website. I've been hooked on it ever since. Since then his music has become popular in the rave scene especially with trancy breakbeats, and I can't imagine any better example of trancy breakbeats than this album. You can't go wrong."
5,Games Christians Play,"The first time I read this book, I couldn't stop laughing. It is, however, a serious look at ""Christian"" behavior. Although it was written some time ago, the behaviors do not change. Humor is one of the best ways to criticize without pain. I'd like to see it as an adult Sunday School study."
3,two strikes and you are out,"I ordered this item over a year ago and it shipped great with out any problems. I tried ordering a matching item a year later and it arrived broken, they tried sending me a replacement and it was broken as well. It was shipped a box within a box, but there were no packing materials between the boxes. I was disappointed as I wanted it for a holiday party. It is a wonderful product, when you can recieve it uncracked/unbroken."
5,Cute,Cute little twist to the Original Cinderella. Most of the time sequels are not my favorite. But disney did a good job on this one. I say thumbs up!
3,"Pretty good, but one major plot hole...","We got this movie for my 5-year-old daughter for Valentine's Day, and she LOVES it. I must admit - I enjoyed it as well, but I noticed one major plot hole: when time is reversed, where is the Fairy Godmother? Is she outside of time, and so remains a statue while everything is happening in the past? I don't mean to over-analyze this movie - obviously, I am not part of Disney's target audience, but it seems to me to be a huge flaw to the plot."
3,Cinderella III,"I am satisfied with the arrival of the package in a timely manner, but the quality of the DVD was not excellent. Though the owner advertised that there were scratches on the DVD, the owner stated that the DVD still played. But the scratches are in some the key parts of the movie so that was a little disheartening. Other than that I am pleased with my purchase."
5,GREAT!,"I was very happy with this dvd. Me and my daughter have pry watched it a million times by now, thannks!!!:)"
3,Kind of Boring...,The reviews to this movie were really good and I am a Cinderella fan and had not seen this one yet. I bought it and was slightly disappointed in the movie. It was just not what I expected.
5,I LOVE CINDRELLA!,"Most movies get cheesier and cheesier as the sequals continue to grow but this movie (Cinderella III) is absolutely adorable and not really cheesy at all!! The characters look the exact same, talk the same, and the only thing I could even begin to criticize is that Anastasia's demeanor is better in this one. But the movie is awesome and if you're a true Cinderella fan, you have to watch Cinderella III. (:"
