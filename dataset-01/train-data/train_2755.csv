3,Good serum,"I liked it, but I have to say that it did tingle a little. My skin felt smooth after a week, but my skin is always very smooth and soft. I think it is a good weather shield, especially with the current NYC weather."
2,Too much hype/very overpriced,"I tried the entire line of Murad Environmental Shield products and spent over 300.00. I will say this was probably the best product of the entire line, yet it wasn't good enough to justify the price. Disappointed I spent so much money thinking that the most expensive would be the ""best"". I'm using a product now that costs 1/4 of the amount I spent on this line and see incredible results!! Don't bother with this line."
4,Great product,"My husband gifted me a CHI. (He is awesome) Anyhow, we travel a lot and off course I want to take my CHI with me wherever I go. This little baggie makes it possible. It really does what it says. Pack it while it's hot! This bag has made my life easier, and my husbands because he no longer has to wait for me to finish packing because I'm still waiting on my curling iron to cool down! I didn't give it a full five stars because it is a tad small and I could use some more cord storage space, but even so it is a great little thing to have, I think it is a must for any girl that loves to travel, do her hair, and believes that those two should be compatible!"
5,perfect travel pal,I purchased a dozen of these and gave them out for Christmas gifts.Everyone was thrilled to receive it because when travelling yourcurling iron is always too hot to pack and each person shared theirstories of creativity on how they'd been dealing with the hot iron.
5,Great heatproof flat iron/curling iron case,"Imagine the scene: a hot iron, cold water and your tender skin. Burn no more with the Baggallini flat iron/curling iron cover, where you can run and gun your curling iron back in its pretty heat-resistant holster before dashing out the door. Fits all sizes, comes in multiple colors."
3,too small,i have Hot Tools curling irons and they stick out the top so it makes it hard to close the bag. Good for a flattening iron.
4,nuff tune!,"almost every song on this CD is a hit, thanks to the top name artists that are on there. From beginning to end you could just pop in the Cd and go, rarely skipping any tracks. Now this is what I call reggae entertainment!"
1,Three Men and a Maid,"this book, three men and a maid is just plain boring.I would not suggest that anyone read this book ever."
3,Three Men and a Maid,"Usual entertaining story from Wodehouse, typical slightly far fetched plot but the experienced reader of Wodehouse ignores this to revel in the rollicking good humour of his magnificent prose and comic scenarios."
3,a decent attempt at a Pulp Fiction rip-off,"As B-movies go, this one is pretty good. Funny, but definitely motivated by the Pulp Fiction movie. Still, pretty funny."
5,"Even after 33 years of marriage, we're laughing and learning","Even though I've read a great many books on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, this is the book my wife and I share as we learn more about each other and ourselves. We've given it as gifts to friends and business colleagues who describe problems and troubles with their relationships. They read 16 Ways and report that ""Now I understand why ..."" and that ""we're talking about why and how we are the way we are and how each of us has to relate.""As my wife said, ""you're so normal, and I thought you were just being difficult!""If you've never heard or read of the MBTI or Psychological Type, or if you are an expert, this book has much to offer. Highly recommended to couples who are wondering how love can grow when lust subsides."
2,There are better books on Type.,"If you've read Kroeger and Thusen's other books, like ""Type Talk At Work"" or ""Type Talk"", you'll recognize most of that material in this book. ""16 Ways To Lover Your Lover"" doesn't add much to the two works mentioned above, and if you are well read on the MBTI this book won't add much to what you already know. However, if Type is new to you, and you're looking for some fun ways to explore your relationship with a significant other, this book is worth a shot."
2,"Entertaining, but not educational","While this book is generally on with its observations of general human behavior, it should in the relationship section, not psychology. Its pop-psych style of unsubstantiated examples doesn't provide much valuable information for you to learn from. It's an entertaining read, but when all is said and done, it's difficult for a reader with any knowledge of the MBTI to feel like they've learned anything worthwhile. If you want a book about relationship quirks, this is the one. Otherwise, look for something else."
2,Changing is Everything,"As a guy who spent many years working for a small company that grew to become a giant corporation, my success was a byproduct of getting my employees engaged in the process of work & being able to foster a sales environment throughout my operation.I never realized I was adopting the zenprenuerial philosophy of selling; I always thought it was just good old fashioned common sense. As far as I'm concerned, establishing rapport with the client & maintaining close communication made the job much easier. It helped that we offered great service and had hard working, ethusiastic employees taking care of customers. We couldn't lose.This book labels all the successful steps very nicely; although the catchy phrases are more fluff than substance. This isn't rocket science, but it is nice information to have handy, in case of an outbreak of bad customer service rearing its head ugly anywhere."
1,Not This One!!!,Pass on this pathetic waste of time. If you really want 'The Very Best of The Archies' buy the 1999 edition of this album that features the two remixes of 'Sugar Sugar' by Pistel and by Julian Beeston. I also recommend 'Absolutely The Best of The Archies' instead of this collection. The quality is much better.Skip this one at all costs. That 'Satisfaction/Sugar Sugar' mix is a complete waste of the 1's and 0's on the disc.
3,"Debate worthy, interesting","Such a terrible drought in our land! Not only is there a famine of joy, but a lack of understanding of what joy is. There is more than just this."
2,Too Advanced for an 8 year old!,"This is a product that is far too advanced for our eight year old son. It's complicated from start to finish, and our son had zero interest in the entire kit. The reading is advanced, in depth, and above and beyond what most 8-10 year olds think detective work is all about. Even the table top code was too difficult. I think it is a cool concept, but the age range must be adjusted. I would recommend 13+."
1,I didn't notice it saying anywhere that it only works with the 80.00 lab!,"I bought this as a christmas gift for my nephew, imagine my surprise when it arrives and printed on the box plainly it says to be used with the 80.00 Whodunit lab! Just making sure no one else does the same thing."
2,Not as good as the original,"These are four new cases that were created for the Whodunit kit. The original is very well made, really fun and educational. These ""new"" cases have far fewer experiments or crimes to solve, and a lot of reading to get to the point. The cases are set in different countries, so kids do learn a bit through the travel, but there's not much for kids to actually do. And then it all ends with a cliff-hanger--a pretty clumsy set up to buy more cases (which never were made). The original had 6 well-contained cases, with each of the first five highlighting a different forensic experiment, and the sixth combining all of the others in an exciting finale. Buy the original, but skip these."
4,My 2 yr. old son loves it....,"I bought this for my two year old son based on on-line reviews. He loves it and can now even tell me that Fred plays the flute and Ted plays the Tuba. The book plays with the concept of opposites -- eg. big bed, little bed or fast car, slow car. It's not my favorite of his books, but he loves it and that's what matters."
3,"good optics & solid construction, but...","The thread pitch on the focuser is to high so even very light pressure on the eye pieces causes them to rack back in; thus if you let your eyes or glasses touch the eyepieces you need to hold onto the focusing knob. Other than this the closest I could get them to focus was about 3X the specified close fucos distance. Otherwise very little color fringing and good sharpness all the way to the edge of field. Eye relief is nice I can get almost the whole FOV while wearing glasses. and when locked the tabletop tripod is acually quite solidVERY disappointing to see such an easily corrected mistake in the focuser of a nice pair of binoculars with incredible ""bang for the buck"""
5,Best binoculars I own.,"I have binoculars from Nikon, Bushnell, and others. All my binoculars have shortcomings, none are perfect. But believe me, money will not buy better than this."
4,Barska 15 x 70,Great deal for the money. No cheap parts. You will need a full size tripod with these as the are too heavy for star gazing.
2,Not a tutorial for an Industrial Practioner of SPC or EPC,"I purchased the book in hopes to further my knowledge of application of the SPC to Engineering Process Control (EPC). I found one article, somehow useful, about application of the EWMA (Chapter 11). This book is a collection of article, more less like proceedings for an academic convention. Not much practical hints, neither is a tutorial."
5,Read it in paperback years ago loved it couldnt find a copy requested it for kindle yes yes,It was just the thing i loved to read and wanted to reread it yes passes th e link to friendsbet the think charrater is related to me winks
5,Hysterically funny with great twists,"If making people laugh brings good karma, then Cindy Cruciger is set for life. I loved this book with its quick, sometimes twisted humor and unbelievabley unique characters and plot. This has to be one of the most original, wildly funny books that I've read in years."
2,Nope,"Maybe it's because i have a teeny tiny attention span. Maybe it's because i have read some of the most exciting, riveting books I have ever read over the last couple of weeks. Maybe I expected too much from this book. Maybe it was all three of these that made me put down this book after reading the first chapter. I found the story dull, and the characters boring. It did nothing to grab my attention and did even less to keep it. Time to move on to something else..."
4,Cute and Funny,"The premise to this story line is different and funny which adds a good dimension to everything else going on. The author has a unique sense of humor and it comes through. I like a book that makes me laugh out loud, and this one did."
4,A fun book.,A light hearted story of ghosts and haunting and revenge. Lots of humor and likable characters. Now to wait for book 2.
5,Funny and Quirky,"I liked this book. It was funny and quirky at the same time. Well written but kind of ""out there"" with references to voodoo curses and ghosts of dead people who throw food. I liked how the main character was able to overcome obstacles (the goat, the kitten) and make them work."
2,I couldn't finish it,"This book was all over the place. Too many characters to keep up with, constantly changing scenes mid chapter. Really hard to keep up with."
2,Didn't hold my interest,"Sorry for the 2 stars; but, I couldn't get into this one. If a book doesn't catch my attention within the first 2 or 3 chapters, I usually don't force myself to finish it."
4,Doughnuts for Fat Tuesday,"Everyone knows about Mardi Gras in New Orleans, right?If you don't, or if you want to know more then Mimi's First Mardi Gras is the book to read. Written for a young age level it imparts information for everyone.In story form the book tells us about beignets ( doughnuts eaten for the holiday breakfast), the different groups that march in the parades, trinkets and doubloons thrown from the floatsIllustrated in the vibrant colors of Mardi Gras ( purple, green and gold)the pictures make the story come alive."
4,Great Mardi Gras book for Kindergarteners,"I grew up in New Orleans and this book perfectly describes what Mardi Gras was like in my family. The only difference was that after the parades when we went to my cousins' house, we ate homemade fried chicken! We now live in Dallas but try to celebrate Mardi Gras here with music, beads, and king cake parties. We went to Mardi Gras in New Orleans last year so our children understand it but our friends don't have a clue! I read this book to my daughter's kindergarten class and they loved it. It explained to a bunch of ""Texans"" what Mardi Gras is all about. I would have given it 5 stars but it's a little too long and the song at the end is weird."
3,Armband for MP3,"This is not a bad product, but it is diffcult to insert my cell phone. Overall I would buy it again"
1,worthless junk,"the first time i attempted to use it, the ""window"" popped out and my phone fell on the pavement, i guess i will look for possibly an OEM accessory, or see what i can find local.i purchased 1 for blackberry bold and one for LG optimums"
1,armband for MP3 player,"Slides down a lot after running/biking for excess of 20 minutes.Also the inside of it had glue/goop that attached itself to the entire MP3 player. Trying to get it off has been a hassle. Try to use rubbing alcohol to get it off, got most off with that. Still a little left. Tried to clean the inside of armband off with same stuff. I don't want to use it again, afraid the glue will get all over my MP3 player again.If it weren't for the glue, I would rate it at 3 to 4 stars out of 5."
1,Not that great,"The products works great. However, It has glue inside the the case that gets all over your phone. Nor worth the time or money"
1,Doesn't fit my need,"GOOD QUALITY, BUT LIMITED USEABILITY. NO MECHANISM TO KEEP CELL PHONE FROM FALLING OUT OF THE POCKET IT'S MEANT TO BE KEPT IN. VERY BULKY. MADE FOR A BULGING UPPER ARM ONLY."
4,RELIABLE,RELIABLE AND DURABLE. HAVE HAD MINE FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 YEARS AND STILL IN GOOD CONDITION. HAVE USED IT FOR MY COBY MP3 AND MY PHILIPS MP3 PLAYERS. HAS VELCRO BACKING SO FITS TO YOUR SIZE AND HOLDS UNDER ANY SHAKING MANEUVERS. PLAYERS SLIP IN THROUGH THE TOP
2,Ehhhh,"This is just a basic armband, however it will not work for anyone with a small arm. I don't know if they come in different sizes, but if it is for a child or a small armed person, it will not work or you will have to sew the band shorter. It would be nice if it was closer to one-size-fits-all"
3,Almost there,"I bought this armband product and converted it to be used as a wrist band. The reason is that I wanted to use my cell phone as a wrist watch. Needless to say, there were some sewing modifications I needed to do. First was to shorten the arm band which worked great. Second, the clear plastic had to be cut off - that also worked out great, except that this required the ""open end"" to be sewn closed to keep the cell phone in place. The last thing that needed to be done was to cut out the opening ""a little more"" so that all of the keys were accessible on my smart cell phone - without removing the phone from the arm band. This also turned out great.... So I know have the ability to wear my smart cell phone as a wrist watch.... I'm wondering if there is an easier way to get more wrist band options like this?? Is this a business opportunity waiting to happen? Feel free to contact me ..."
3,Too small for a Blackberry Storm.,The case is Too small for a Blackberry Storm. Wish they would come out with one that fit!
4,I have purchased for Coby Mp3 player. This is good.,I didn't find any problems to report. It is very fit for my mp3 player. The holder size is approx 3.5 inch length and 2 inch wide.
5,mp3 arm brace,i love it i listen to music when i take the baby for his walks it keeps him and me happy
3,Armband,"Holds the phone snug, but probably won't be able to handle the larger Desert Storm era phones that are out nowadays. Tough to access the phone through the clear plastic. Also a bit uncomfortable if your sweet biceps get larger during work outs."
4,Arm band,"Bought the band as a gift to hold an MP3 player, hard for this person to put player in pocket and have enough lead to put plugs in ears so it was handy for that. Plan to get another one for myself!"
4,"NIce product, neoprene worth the extra cost","This product was as described, well sized, and looks to be well constructed. When it says ""small sized phones"" they are using an old standard for small. This would work for a flip phone or a ""feature"" phone, but doesn't quite fit a 3.7 inch screen smart phone. My HTC Incredible will slide into the case, but the top sticks out, and the touch screen doesn't work through the clear plastic.That said, this case is nice, and will work well for an iPod (with wheel) or a standard MP3 player. Recommended for those, but not for a smart phone."
3,Cellet Neoprene Arm,"The arm band works very well, but it only last a few months if it's use often. And I use it 2 to 3 times a week. It starts to come apart after about three months. It does not cost very much. I guess that's why it does not last long."
2,Oversized for most MP3 Players,"I ordered this product thinking it would work as an armband for my MP3 player but it is way too large to be used for most MP3 players out there. It is designed to be used to hold your cellphone, the image on the back of the package shows it holding a Motorola Razor phone. If you need an armband to hold your phone this is probably a great product but I don't know anyone who needs to hold their phone while working out. I would have returned it but it was so cheap it would have cost more to ship it back."
4,Really like this armband...,"It's comfortable and I'm able to get my player in and out of it with no problem. I'm also able to use the controls on my player thru the clear vinyl front with ease. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars only because I think the band is just a little wide. While it doesn't hinder anything, it just take a little getting used to when I've used thinner bands in the past, but I do like the look at feel of this one. The top is completely open but there's no fear of the player coming out as it fits snuggly against my arm. I'd definately recommend the product."
1,never used it,"I really can not say if this is good or bad.Got it for my husbands player,but he never used it."
3,"I ordered 3M, received Scotch -- not the same at all.","I've used 3M Photo Mount for decades, and it's still holding nicely on some 30 year old images. I ordered several cans from Amazon, and received a Scotch product instead. The Scotch product has a nasty tendency to spit out blobs of glue, while the 3M product produces a smooth even spray.I have other uses for the Scotch product, so I kept it. But Amazon -- take notice. There's a real difference."
5,"Expensive, but works great","The adhesion is excellent as is ease of use. My only caveat is the price. The small 4.2 oz can I have says it will cover ""up to"" 12sft. At near $5 a can, that's .41 cents a square foot if you only spray the picture and not the mounting surface. Double that cost if you spray both."
4,Mexican Train Collector's Tin Edition,"We enjoy the game since we have played it at a friend's house, but were disappointed with the corroded batteries and how hard they are to remove and replace."
2,"Good music, bad vocals","You know, I tried to give this band a chance because I read good reviews of all thier albums. The music is great,the guitar player's got some awesome licks and the drummer ain't bad either. However, these psuedo-Ozzy vocals are not doing any justice for these guys. There are so many effects put on the guys voice that I'm pressed to believe he can truly sing at all. Because of the vocals I could not bear to listen to the album any further than the 4th song. Within days I sold this album for 5 bucks."
1,black sabbath this is not-and it is trying very hard,"Uggghhhhh...Another band who think the path to realising your own vision lies in completely ripping off other bands. This album is just plain sad. It reminds me of sleep(highly overrated)who went to the extent of using some sort of an effect to mimic Ozzy. A lot of doom bands have had similaritys to black sabbath. But this sort of thing is ridiculous. And he only sounds like ozzy in a superficial way. It sounds very forced and contrived. There are probably quite a few singers in a world this large able to do a decent ozzy impersonation. However I dont know why anyone with a brain would be interested.What is this weak stoner stuff supposed to be anyway. It has more in common with 8os moron rock, palm trees, cars and girls etc. That is not doom. File next to poison and skid row. And kyuss and orange goblin. ..."
1,Natural? Far From it,Simply because ingredients have chemically natural origins does not make it an 'all natural product'. Not a thing here aside from the oleic acid (olive oil) that i'd want on my skin.Ingredients from MSDS/LabelFragrance(s)/perfume(s)GlycerinStearic acidOleic acidSodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)Sodium hydroxidePalm kernel acidColorant/Pigment/Dye(s)
3,a good start,"This book does explore contributions by women to American engineering and invention, but it seems to focus on women as wives and helpers of inventors and/or on women who invented ""feminine"" things like gadgets for sewing and cooking. Few of the women profiled seemed to work in the ""hard"" sciences.The prose is not terribly exciting or energetic. I would recommend this book to readers interested in feminism or invention, but I would encourage them to find other sources as well."
2,Not that great,"I gave this to my teenage daughter for Christmas last year. Very disappointing. While we are comfortable with computers and such, we are not experts, and it took forever to figure this thing out. It will only hold about 20 songs and is just not worth the trouble to spend way so much time to load the songs. The accompanying instruction book was obviously written by a non-English speaking person because it was just not easy to follow. I suppose part of the problem is the lack of memory, but I would say this is not very user friendly. After a few weeks, she stuck it in a drawer and there it sits. My recommendation is to spend a little more and get something with more memory and a better reputation."
1,Didigtal Audio Player,"This product really sucked. Sorry, but it did. It only holds one song and it difficult to use in the first place. Waste of cash..."
4,The solution for the Cute but not Cuddly,"The reason it could not work on Windows 98 because you have the first edition and you will might need to upgrade to Windows 98 SE or SP1. You might be one of those people who don't update or upgrade their computer. To do that, go to Windows Update in the Start Menu, but to do this, you gotta go online. After you connect online, go to Windows Update, then after It checks for updates, on the left, go to one of the selections and find Windows 98 SE. Then deselect the others except for Windows 98 SE and go to review and update. I can't wait till my birthday or christmas to get this MP3 Player."
4,Big Bang for Small Bucks!,"Simply put.. this is an excellent hollow mortise chisel at a reasonable price. The machining is good but does require some honing to take off light machine marks. And you should hone the inside of the chisel also to really get it sharp. But.. most chisels costing 3-4 times more require the same procedure to get them up to the maximum they can achieve. The tolerances between the bit and chisel are excellent as the bit is also well made. Very sturdy over-all construction.You should keep in mind that this is a 3/4"" shank as most CMT's are. I also have the 3/8"".. 1/2"".. 3/4"" as I do a lot of A&C; carcass work.. work-bench's and various sizes are required for mortise and tenon and mortises to recieve accent pieces on the A & C. The 3/4"" shank is not a problem on my Industrial floor mortiser but if you have a standard floor mortiser or bench-top.. make sure it accepts the 3/4"" or have a bushing that will adopt to accept the 3/4"" shank!"
1,This chisel bent under light usage,"I bought several of these bits to use with my jet mortise machine. Save some time, don't but CMT. I have used two different sizes (1/4 and 5/16) they both bent after drilling less then 10 mortises. My bigger bits have not bent (yet), but I have not used them much. This bit ruined a good piece of walnut."
1,Dissapointed,LES Senteurs Patchouli By Molinard for Women: Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 OzDoes not last. The fragrance is heavy ar first and then dissapears. Not the Patchouli aroma I have had in the past. I wish I could have sampled it before I purchased it. I would not have ordered it.
3,THIS IS NOT PATCHOULI SCENT ! ! ! !,"I am a avid Patchouli wearing person. Have all the ""Kiss My Face"" Patchouli products. And was really looking forward to a Patchouli spray instead of the usuall oil I have been wearing for years.DOn't waist your money It's not even close to a Patchouli scent..."
5,if your an alumnus relive your past,got this for my father in law who was an alumni and he really enjoyed reliving the moment...great piece of history although i must say it was a bit pricey....
1,Alternate option for free,"Get a video camera, and on a sunny day take your dog out in the yard and show the sun shining on his ass. Because that is the equivalent of the Villanova win."
2,Not the same scent.,This Chaps in the clear bottle is not the same as the Chaps in the brown bottle.... Which seems to have been discontinued. I wish they would bring back the old kind. The new stuff is a real let-down. Why do people always have to mess with a good thing?
5,I like the way Chaps smells on me.,"This stuff is hard to find in stores. I like it and others have commented how good I smell wearing it. Other men that don't like the way it smells, don't but it."
3,what happened ???,"what happened to the old chaps ??? this doesnt small like the chapsi used to buy in the brown bottle !!! this is no where as good as the other chaps cologne !!! BRING BACK THE REAL CHAPS, IT WAS THE BEST COLOGNE EVER !!!"
3,"Where's the Beef? Great info, but too brainy.","This documentary from BBC was excellent and thorough in terms of research, especially the history of music during the slave days, but the parade of talking heads (who seem to finish each other's line of dialogue ...was this pre-scripted?) got old and dry. I don't even remember that they noted who the experts were.Some of the experts were musicians and church folks, but none spoke with the fire contained in the music. The music selections were way too short, and just when I'd start to be inspired, they moved along to another segment. The most moving parts contained some clips from ""Say Amen Somebody,"" the tribute to Thomas Dorsey, but even here they snipped them short. If you want to crawl under the skin of this music and those who pioneered it, get ""Say Amen Somebody."" If you love this music, view SAS, then this documentary, then run back to view ""Say Amen Somebody."""
2,Disappointed,"I had expected more music and less conversation. If you are seeking a good ""listening"" album pass this one by."
3,Fits a little loose,"It's a tank boot. It does not fit as snug as most. It goes on and off with little effort, but serves it purpose and was half price of most of the others. I'll take some precautions to make sure it doesn't fall off while diving."
1,opps...,EGA came off in a few days. had to use gorilla crazy glue to reattach.... Come on... not up to my Marine Corps standards... So sad.... was it made in China ???
3,USMC simple flask,It's a simple flask. I was sold because of the emblem. It was a gift. I haven't heard how it's holding up yet.
4,I liked it more than my hubby,"The product was delivered on time and was of excellent quality. It is very handsome and I really liked it. My hubby liked it but is not quite used to the thinness - he usually wears an Invicta I got for him, which he loves. Overall, I would recommend the watch if you like something that's elegant yet understated."
4,funny stuff,"Well, if you're a smeghead, you have to get this video. It has nearly an hour of bloopers with the cast and the cheezy spaceship models we all love. Hosted by Kryten, who incidentally, is almost as funny as the smeg ups. It's very entertaining to watch the cast's various reactions to messing up."
4,Spacial !,"Okay, Dick shouldn't sing ! We don't admire this guy because of his voice . Once you get pass that, this album totally rocks ...EXCEPT for the Christmas song ...what a new development... ""Silent Night"", I feel , is entirely unnecessary.What a cool version of ""Smoke On The Water""...who would have thought that THAT song could sound better ?"
3,It's more fun if you already know Dick Dale,"If you are new to Dick Dale or just getting reacquainted then don't buy this album first. Try ""Tribal Thunder"" instead and then come back to Spacial Disorientation.If you are a fan or are into to guitar music in general then definitely pick up this album. Dick spreads out and plays out and around from the surf sound that made him a king.Dick proves that he can play well anything he wants to in any style or genre.If you are looking just for hardcore surf guitar this album will disappoint you but if you want to hear a great musician groove outside of his standard fare then dig in."
4,Nice product,"I was wary when reading about Murad's Resurgence line, However, I am very happy with the way my skin has improved in just 2 weeks. Murad's age-diffusing serum is my favorite and I intend to continue using it."
4,"Well it does say diffusing, not reversing ...","Unable to give highest rating as yet because I have not been using thislong enough to tell what if anything will happen with it; however, I putsome on and was chagrined to realize that I am still seventy."
1,Horrible. The worst.,"This serum is absolutely the worst. I don't know if I bought a knock out, but I have never experienced something so bad from a prestigeous brand. It stung my skin, then the serum started to peel off after it dried out on my skin. I have decided to use it on my body, so I don't totally feel like I wasted my money, but it stung there too. The interesting thing is though when I tried it at Sephora it had completely different smell and feel to it than when I received mine from this seller. Also, it didn't come in a box, rather than sealed in a plastic wrap. The price of it was also almost 50% lower than everywhere else, so I can't say for sure if the dr. Murad came out with something not worth a penny, or I just purchased a fake product."
2,Great moisterizer ONLY!,"I'm shocked at the amount of entries stating reduced wrinkles? I'm 52 and don't have truly major wrinkles but I do have those fine lines and dark circles under my eyes that I wanted to lighten. I've been using the cream for 2 months & 2 weeks and I see no difference whatsoever. It is a good moisterizer though but for the money there are much cheaper ones! After consulting my dermatologist he said there are 100s of creams on the market that claim the same thing but all of those high priced creams do the same as all the other moisterizers. So save yourself some money, drink more water and stay out of the sun or do what my derm recommended, use retin-a or kinerase!!"
5,"Costly, however is worth it.","I am pushing 5o and I needed some serious facial skin care products. I was not willing to pay an arm and leg however, I had a boundry of what I was willing to spend. I am so glad I chose this product. I do not regret ording this and will continue to use it as long as it is working. I feel like my skin has improved so much. I have very sensitive skin and can not use anything with an SPF in it. This treatment that I am using as of today is the best I have ever found and am extremely pleased with it."
5,Murad Products,"I have been using Murad products since I turned 40, 16 years ago. Initially, the products were only available through infomercials. I cannot imagine life without them. Until two years ago I only used the treatment phase for combination skin. Now I use the Resurgence formula. I love it! It lasts a long time and is worth the hefty price. I don't wear any foundation and I get compliments all the time! If you are on the fence it is definitely worth trying. You won't regret it!"
1,Allergic Reaction,"I do not have sensitive skin at all, but I had a very bad reaction to this product. I used it several times and noticed that it would burn a little when applied to freshly cleansed skin. Then one day, I fully broke out in a rash. Luckily it went away fairly quickly, but it was very alarming."
2,would not buy again,"I have tried this product for 3 months, with no major results. I would agree it serves as a great moisturiser but thats it. I would not purchase this product again."
4,Nice!,I really like this serum. It makes my skin feel nice. It doesn't work miracles or anything. Glad I found it for a good price. Will probably try to find something a bit less expensive that does just as good when I run out. I bought it because it was recommended to me when I got a facial. Great product but I think I can find something just as good.

5,What an awesome book !,"I have yet to trade the systems outlined in this book, but I can honestly say in advance, that this book will enhance my trading and investing by orders of magnitude. This is an extremely well-written book, that is extremely simple to read, and has outstanding examples that pound its principles home. I am going to read it a 2nd time, before embarking on the use of some of its trading mechanisms, but never before have I read book of such diligence, and felt as confident about its use, as I have with this book. I wish I could shake hands with its author !Highly, highly recommended, if you are interested in learning about P&F;, or reviewing its concepts."
2,No beat wonder,Dreamy- stoned out- beaded curtain- hooka -paisly music if you like that sort of thing.
5,Amazing comfort,My company provides these as ergonomic work chairs. They are amazing. So comfortable and completely adjustable. The adjustable lumbar support is hard to beat. Highly recommended.
5,Fantastic chair! I use it daily,"My company provided me with this chair when I starting having some back problems.The back tilting motion is super smooth, the chair feels exceptionally sturdy, and the texture of the chair allows sweat and stuff like that to never happen. I had no idea it was worth so much! I'm glad I got it for free. Not sure if I can give it 5 stars if it was $700, but then again- the chair I have at home which is $70 is much much worse.Perhaps it's worth it! I haven't had it long enough to understand its sustained benefits but so far so good."
2,Watch out!!,"This seems like a great chair at first - but watch out!! The tip of your finger can become trapped and seriously pinched when the adjustable arm pivots inward unexpectedly. I thought I was going to see my fingertip lying on the floor! I even checked for a product recall, because this is a very dangerous chair."
1,Tragic example of the failure of Christian apologetics.,"Any dictionary which denies science, to the extent of insisting upon inserting the word ""imagined"" into each reference to ""evolution,"" will never get your children any closer to knowledge. Are there controversies within evolution? Sure there are! Punctuated equilibrium, mitochondrial evolution, and a whole host of others. But to pretend that evolution itself is nonsense or ""imagined"" simply for the purpose of maintaining an untenable belief that the world is less than 10,000 years old is not education; it's propaganda. This dictionary fails on all counts."
1,Shameful.,"Any parent that buys this for their child should be locked up for child abuse. This dictionary is nothing but a tool to keep children in the dark & preserve beliefs that have been debunked countless times. Despicable! I cannot believe that in the year 2012 there are still people who believe in nonsense like creationism. There is SO MUCH evidence to the contrary, and you have to literally plug your ears & cover your eyes to keep believing in such foolishness in this day & age. Utter trash, and shame on you for trying to brainwash your kids against science and knowledge. Go buy a REAL dictionary & try to build up the few brain cells you have left that haven't been destroyed by the primitive ignorance of religion."
1,Ignorance is Bliss(tering),"Evolution: ""The imagined process. . .""How sad. The entry on ""evolution"" alone is enough to convince any sane, rational human being that this dictionary was written for one purpose, to help further the devolution of humanity back to a state of fear and ignorance!"
1,Regurgitating the Apple,"If you're not sure what regurgitation means, I wouldn't recommend looking it up in this impersonation of a dictionary. Definitions are based on imagination and preference. This particular faction of Christianity longs for those blissful days before that first bite of the tree of knowledge. What better indication could there be that Christianity can no longer coexist comfortably with our present understanding of reality, than a need for an entirely separate dictionary? Forcing this kind of ignorance on children is reprehensible and inexcusable. Shame on anybody who buys this."
1,Yawn.,"Sorry to say that no matter how often I open this book to take another look, I can't get over the feeling that it took about five minutes to write. The poetry isn't. While the artwork has some good ideas in it one again gets the feeling of lack of development. There are better choices."
3,dental pads,"The pads are sort of small, it makes it had to wrap around a finger. Once in contact w/ dog saliva they get very slippery & hard to hang onto. But the dogs don't seem to mind the taste at all."
1,All 3 of my dogs hate this product.,"These are exactly like Stridex zit pads, if you've ever used those. The only difference is, these have peppermint chemical scented teeth-cleaning juice on them instead of zit solution. All three of my dogs shy away from the smell when I open the container, and they don't like it when I try and use these on their teeth. They don't like the taste or the smell. All 3 dogs are OK (and sometimes eager) with manual brushing with a CET meat flavored toothpaste, and I thought these would be a time saving alternative to that. It doesn't seem to make much difference on their teeth and it definitely doesn't do anything for canine halitosis. Waste of my ten bucks."
2,My Dog absolutely hates these...,"I wish that my dog liked these. However, I think the flavor is too strong because he won't let me get anywhere near him when I open the container up. They have this peppermint smell. I am not sure why this company did not opt for a meat flavored dental wipe.The concept of these is great. I really wish my dog wold use them. Although I can see why people with bigger dogs might not be so happy as the pads are very small.For now I;d save m money and use a doggie brush and some doggie toothpaste."
2,My dogs hate the antiseptic scent,"My dogs used to not mind teeth cleaning (I previously used the Nutri-Vet Enzymatic Chicken Flavored Canine Toothpaste). I wanted to try the DDS Dental Wipes because it sounded promising. Although it makes it easier to clean their teeth, my dogs detest the smell and taste. Every time they see me with the container, they run and hide. They never reacted this way with their previous toothpaste."
3,8in1 wipes not recommended,"I recieved this product and was eager to use it. First of all I opened the package to discover that the container was open and was leaking, secondly the smell is not at all appealing to pets, it smells like Listerien mouth wash, which dogs obviously don't use, so why would they make it this flavor, who knows. My dogs dispise this product and I am very very dissapointed. I advise that people seeking a dental regimen for their beloved animals stick to a doggy toothbrush and paste, and a paste that is to their liking. I hope this company improves this product to a better flavor and a better packaging, because to have a leaking product in the mail is not a way to make a customer happy.P.S. the wipes are very small not ment for large dogs, so big dog owners pass on this product, save your money, and buy your pet a toothbrush and paste."
2,Dental Wipes,Package arrived with top popped off leaving contents dried out and virtually unusable. I will get items like this from another supplier or directly at the pet store to avoid problems in the future.
4,Doggy Dental Wipes,"My dog really enjoys the flavor of the wipe and she doesn't give me a hard time about using it. Her teeth do seem to be slowly getting less tartar, and that was what I had hoped for when I purchased it."
5,Dog dental wipes,The wipes were received on time and in good shape. They are working fine. I chose these because they were the best buy on Amazon.
3,Container opened in Box,I would have given this item 5 stars had the container not been opened in the box. The box was all wet and the wipes were all over the box. The wipes worked well on my little dog's teeth. I would try again.
4,Dental Wipes,"I've been buying these from Drs Foster&Smith but with shipping, it gets expensive so I thought I would try these. I don't see any quality difference and if I bundle my order I get free shipping"
4,Dental Wipes,"I like these wipes as my JRT does not like to have his teeth brushed! They are easier to use also. Not sure if they work as well, but at least I'm able to try to keep his teeth clean. I'd but this product again."
5,beautiful book,I'm fairly new to Fair Isle Knitting and this book is one I'm glad I purchased. The directions are easy to understand and the book is beautifully laid out and full of color suggestions.
2,Kind of a disappointment,"The history content of this book is very interesting, but frankly, the patterns suck. They are intricate in terms of the colorwork, but it's just one boxy sweater after another - the kind of stuff that makes knitting seem really lame. Do not buy this book if you are looking for fair isle patterns that you would actually wear. I think it is overpriced."
2,Fading Poetry,"I remember listening to this album when it was released in France back in the mid 80s by Virgin. It was probably the only band from Norway to make it into European nightclubs with A-ha. The name of the group was in itself a riddle (like A-ha's), maybe a reference to Robert Browning's poem, or the Italian renaissance painter, and the pic on the front cover was beautiful.This reedition disappointed me though : the most famous tracks have been remixed and ""Shouldn't have to be like that"" has lost its steam compared to the original release. Some tracks that were on the tape also seem to have been dumped from the CD, like the beautiful instrumental ""The Heather on the Hills"" or ""The True Story"". As a result I was maybe expecting too much from the live tracks that were added here. The fact is, Fra Lippo Lippi's concert performance is not exactly torrid.Overall a big disappointment."
1,Save your money,"The title says ""How"". There does not appear to be a lot of that inside this book. There is a lot of ""jive stuff"" between or about the authors that could have been better spent doing more of the ""How"" instead of the ""jive"". I have read a lot of technical and software books in the last 30 years and this one goes to the bottom of the list."
4,Good,This Toffee Popcorn was good but it was too buttery tasting for me. My college aged kids loved them!
5,Delicious Deal,I got a case of this for under $6 and you can not beat that for the size of the boxes. These are great snacks for the kids at home or on the go.
5,Is it me?,For some reason these smaller boxes taste fresher than the boxes I buy locally.Catch them on sale and the price can't be beat.I love this stuff. Yes it evil but who cares. This is the best movie treat in the world.Nom nom :D
5,"Love, love,love!",These are so good. I can't find the ones I could make in the microwave anymore. They don't make them for some reason. But these are very good and fresh tasting.
3,Jessica is in over her head,"I have enjoyed most of the Murder She Wrote books thus far, but THE MAINE MUTINY falls short for this reader. Jessica Fletcher would never get stuck out in the middle of the ocean with large fish surrounding her. And most of her meddling stems from unrealistic endeavors. Why is she doing certain things? She has no jurisdiction whatsoever to be poking around where she doesn't belong.The author exaggerates quite a bit in this story, and I had trouble believing it. I would have to agree with another reader that not too much is happening here, and that only avid fans should venture home with Jessica in this book, if need be. My advice: skip this one and read other interesting stories in the series. Janice."
2,A bit snoozy (z z z z z z z),"I have read every Murder She Wrote book that is available in paperback and usually love them, however this one is a bit snoozy. I am only about half way through and am forcing myself to continue because I have never read one that I didn't enjoy. But I must say, I am having a little trouble staying interested in this one because there is so little happening."
3,An exorbitant price,"I want to order this product but find that the price is too high. I have noticed that other Audio CD releases are much more affordable. Why not this product? And who's paying these prices? The three stars account for the product's excessive price tag, not the story itself. Sara."
2,The Maine Mutiny - Not the Usual Good Stuff,"It was good, not great, as is usual for Mr. Bain. Jessica floating in the water.....not believable. I was happy to see that she was back in Maine. I always enjoy all the characters that she interacts with."
3,A loooooong read,"I, like several of the other reviewers of ""The Maine Mutiny"" have read and enjoyed all of the Murder, She Wrote books available thus far, but am having trouble finishing this one. There seems to be too much detail about lobstering and not enough action. I am happy that the setting is Cabot Cove though - I always enjoyed the tv episodes that were set there more than the ones set elsewhere."
5,J. Archer,"Typically delightful mystery story in the series. It is especially appealing to those of us who like the stories centered in Cabot Cove. Pleasant descriptive material about the beautiful Maine setting, in addition to the usual captivating mystery story."
1,Resurrecting Ravana,First I should tell you that I love Buffy books. I have read everyone published and have loved them all except this book. The only reason I kept reading this book to the end was I was hoping the plot would improve or something would happen. The characters are not true to form. This book lacks the quips that make BTVS great. The book tried to focus on the relationship of Willow and Buffy while leaving the other relationships hanging in mid air.I could excuse this but it did a bad job of displaying the emotions of both Willow and Buffy. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!
2,Terrible video transfer,"I've long waited for the release of the orginial Halloween series to Blu Ray, if this is any indication of what the quality will be for all of them you'll be disappointed. The picture quality is terrible. I have H20 on DVD and the picture is better on that! It's a dark transfer and very grainy, nothing looks high definition about it whatsoever. It also has no special features, not even a trailer.No time and effort has been put in to clean up the picture, don't wast your money."
1,worst blu ray quality!!!!,Well as a huge fan of the Halloween series i must say this is a terrible quality blu ray.i dont get how they can even call this a blu ray.i think what they did was got the dvd and made it look like a blu-ray.well scratch that the dvd has better quality.so if your a fan and expecting to waste your money too get quality out of this dont.its not worth it..ps the menu for the blu ray looks way better
1,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I PURCHASED THIS DVD AND RETURNED IT ON 3 SEPERATE OCCASSIONS. THE REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN I PLAYED THE DVD, THE PICTURE WAS EXTREMELY FUZZY. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED BY THE PEOPLE AT A & B SOUND THAT THE CAUSE FOR THIS WAS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE/OWN THIS DVD, BUT I KNOW THAT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN. FOR ALL YOU REGGAE FINATICS LIKE MYSELF, CHECK OUT MORGAN HERITAGE - LIVE AT THE LONDON ASTORIA, OR STEEL PULSE - LIVE FROM THE ARCHIVES. THESE TWO DVD'S ARE THE BEST IN MY COLLECTION."
5,Thorough Overview,"All the basic products explained. Has explanations of indexes and how they are used in structured notes and trades, but not the new CD indexes developed in the past year."
3,A bit overrated?,"Don't get me wrong, this book is pretty good, but the ratio of useful things learned per amount of text read is much less than what I would expect from such a ""critically acclaimed"" work. I find it somewhat suspicious that most fixed income books on amazon have a review that recommends this book.Also, as the previous reviewer said, this is not for beginners or for those with only a marginal interest in the area of credit derivatives."
1,Same as the earlier edition,"Pretty much the only difference between this edition and the last one is the cover. It's too bad, because the first edition was carelessly written (not that it isn't occasionally useful). I don't know, maybe we'd prefer people to have a cursory understanding of the products... easier to do business that way."
5,Insightful!,"I took a course offered by Ken Ferris before the book was published, then read the material. It reminded me of a lot of the insights that I gained from the course. Good book for practitioners."
2,"Met the man, taken his courses...","This book, and another by Ferris, was a required textbook for a class taught by the author (Ferris) at the school where he teaches. It is an indication of the respect that the other Finance and Accounting profs have for Prof Ferris that his books are used by no other profs there- in fact, many riducle the simple errors and theoretical mistakes that are present in this book. As a guide to valuation of public firms, this book is useful only in outlining a simplisitc cookie-cutter format that lacks any depth or analysis."
5,amazing detail,"We bought this for my father-in-law, the detail is amazing there are a lot of tiny details and the paint is perfect the size is smaller than what I thought it would be, wich only makes it more amazing, But is totally not for small children, the package has a note from the maker that says it's better for people over 14 wich makes sense once you se all the detail in each piece and how easy is for the smaller parts to get lost, but I think is an amazing instrument for history learning and a incredible collectors item!will update this later when fil give us his feed back!"
2,Stick with the Books,"There are many things that are best to be AVOIDED. Such include: deadly snakes, fatty burgers, villians named Sally and THIS GAME. The gameplay is rather DULL a word that here means repetitive and uneventful. The voice acting is ABYSMAL, a word that means so bad that I couldn't stand it anymore and turned off all sound. The graphics are okay at best. The only thing that is mildly intresting is that as you progress in the story mode (same version of the story that apeared in the equally bad movie) you can unlock Count Olaf's Theature Posters and words with Snicket's deffinitions. But even this isn't enough to truly motivate you. Please don't make the mistake of buying this game. Save your money.With All Do Respect,Discusted Snicket Fan"
4,the movie is better.,i love lemony snicket books and the movie was the best. but im not shure about the game. i played the demo on nick.com it wasnt fun but i bought the game because i thought id be better it was fun but its kinda boring and easy. the graphics are great though!
1,A disappointment for Devon Rex lovers!,I have a devon rex cat and am always looking for good literature about the breed. I was very excited to get this book and will be sending it back promptly. Its 24 pages read like a kindergarten guide to pets. It's all obvious information (like--clean the litter box daily). There is nothing about this book that really celebrates or shedds light on this fantastic breed of cat.
1,This book contains inaccurate information about the breed.,This book is written as a children's book and contains a lot of inaccurate information. Some of the photos depict Cornish Rex and not Devon Rex! The author had good intentions but failed to research the breed enough to write about it. I am a Devon Rex breeder and this book is disappointing.
1,very disappointing,"My fault for not reading the other reviews before I ordered, but I was so pleased to find a book about Devons that I jumped right in. It is a really poor piece of publishing - there's no excuse for irrelevant waffle and obvious errors, especially in such a slim volume."
1,poorly done,A good read for kids but not too informative. THere are lots of erros and misidentified cats in this. Could confuse many children.
4,A book about antique cars for kids,"I think any car enthusiast would probably like to read this to his kids. My second grade teacher read this to our class in the early 1950s. I was somewhat interested in cars at the time, but I always wanted to get a copy of this. It's about a young boy who finds an antique car in a barn and works to get it running. How can any car nut pass this up!"
5,Great little book on fundamentals of aeroacoustics,"This is a very nice to book to have on the shelf of an aeroacoustician. This book gives a detailed information on sound sources and clear and consise explaination of lighthill analogy, curles theorm, moving source radiation e.t.c. Although there are some typos (especially in excercise problems and answers), this book suppliments the standard aeroacoustics texts like Howe's ""Theory of Vortex sound""& ""Acoustics of Fluid structure interactions""."
3,So - SO,"This book is decent for people new to dogs in general. I'd hoped to find more info specific to staffords especially in training and dealing with common stafford problems like chewing and skin problems. There are some things inside I didn't know, so I'd still say it was worth the price."
1,Not good,"This item took at least threel weeks to arrive. When it did it was badly discolored, dirty, had dead bugs, fuzz, and animal hair stuck to it, and it smelled of stale smoke and mold.By no stretch of the imagination could this book been considered in ""good"" condition.I contacted the seller with my concerns, but never heard back from them. I will not order from this seller again."
5,"Provocative, Funny and Cruel","The argument hit me in stages. As I zipped through the stories, I found myself smiling, but then I started thinking more seriously about what this book was saying, and now I think it's cruel and triumphalist. This book may become a tool in the hands of people who want to neglect the poor and feel good about it."
3,different kind of tongs,"This arrived very quickly, pleased about that. I'm still getting used to this tong.The blades only touch along the top edge so most of the surface doesn't come in contact with the food. The blade slides under the food cookie etc but the top blade doesn't grip enough to hold it steady. Not quite a tong or a spatula either. Would have been beter if more of the two blade surfaces touched. I plan to try it another time or two but so far not something I'd buy again."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD. EVER....,"THESE GUYS ARE BY FAR THE BEST DJ'S IN YHE WORLD...Z-TRIP MIXES THE CRAZIEST MUSIC...ALL THE ORIGINAL BREAKS AND BEATS ON TOP OF THE OLD ROCK CUTS...MAN, NOBODY DOES IT AS GOOD AS HIM. AND THE SCRATCHING.....DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS CD. IT'S BY FAR THE DOPEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD. AND I THINK Z-TRIP IS KINDA CUTE TOO...IS HE MARRIED? ANYWAY,I HEARD THERE ARE ONLY LIKE 1000 COPIES PRESSED TOTAL...YOU BETTER GET ON IT,BECAUSE I'M NOT GIVING MINE UP. PEACE."
5,Excellent,"Danger Man is the 1965-6 series starring Patrick McGoohan better known for his subsequent series ""The Prisoner"". This is top notch stylish British secret agent cold war intrigue, and John Drake is the more realistic version of James Bond. Some episodes involve rescuing fellow agents from the East, some from LatinAmerica, and some have a pre-Prisoner aspect to them, such as the one where the whole show is his dream. Towers over anything currently on TV, this is a true '60s classic."
5,A must read!,"This is a great ""first"" book on the Focolare movement. It is easy to read as it unfolds just what Chiara Lubich's dream was for the Catholic Church and how the Holy Spirit helped her in accomplishing that dream. It gives a sense of hope to the coming of the Kingdom of God in a way in which we can all join."
3,Broken,"I had this for several years now with very minimal use. The inside elements came loose and is now useless. Cannot get perfect focus sometimes no matter how you adjust. The zoom is great though, but dims the viewfinder as you zoom farther, kind of like a camera zoom lens."
1,This soap blows,"This soap comes in 6 pretty colors, but as a cleanser it really blows. It barely lathers at all. I feel like I'm showering with an attractive, mildly pleasant smelling brick."
5,ANN SOTHERN : BOMBSHELL BLONDE de HOLLYWOOD!,"ANN SOTHERN WAS ONE OF 'THE GREATS'...A TYPE of GIFT THAT HOLLYWODD HAS FORGOTTON HOW TO GRACE THE WORLD WITH. ANN (BORN HARRIET LAKE) WAS A REAL TALENT:COMIC GENIOUS,GLAM-QUEEN... WHEN 'GLAM' WAS ABOVE and FAR BEYOND THE STARVED - WAIF STATE IT HAS PLUMMETTED TO. ANN WAS A CLASS-ACT. SHE STARRED IN THE DELIGHTFUL 'MAISIE' FILM SERIES and LATER BROUGHT MAISIE TO RADIO. SHE WAS A MAJOR STAR FOR FOUR DECADES. SHE WAS JERRY VAN DYKE'S MOTHER-TURNED-1928-PORTER's VOICE IN 1960's SITCOM 'MY MOTHER THE CAR'....FUNNY,GLAMOUROUS,SMART,GORGEOUS & FUEL EFFIECIENT...WHAT MORE COULD A GUY ASK FOR?"
5,Beautiful playing.,This is a beautiful recording. The clarity and crisp definition are ideal. kWhy do I need to add more words?
4,interesting,this is very interesting smells kinda of icy and kinda like an ocean (but not the salty)
5,Very Good,I love axe. it does get female attention. you just cant put too much on because the scent is so strong. just spray along your chest going down in a strait line. smells great.
2,Inferior quality matcha.,"Ujinotsuyu Matcha Hagoromo is not nearly as good as some of the other brands of matcha I tried. Instead of being a pure green, it had a faint yellow-brownish tinge. It was also quite harsh and bitter-flavored. If you're willing to spend more money but don't want expensive tea ceremony grade matcha, try Do Matcha 2nd Harvest (the red label variety). It has a much lighter and fresher flavor. My local store also carries Maeda-en, which is better than Ujinotsuyu but not as good as Do Matcha."
5,four cups of tea a day!,"This tea is premium. Don't accept green tea in bags; it is less tasty and probably less healthy.Here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful:* cancer* rheumatoid arthritis* high cholesterol levels* cariovascular disease* infection* impaired immune function* acne, omg.And drink four cups a day for the ultimate tea benefits!"
2,Food grade matcha?,"I found the matcha to be very bitter and grainy. I had few bowls but it ended up being used to cookies which were very tasty. Also made some smoothies with honey added and they were a hit.I didnt buy from amazon. I got mine from a tea shop in chinatown for $5/can. I wanted to see if you really get what you pay for.I have been buying my matcha directly from japan(yuuki-cha, ippodo,o-cha) and i dont think its fair to compare since they cost $20-30/can.if you are looking for a serious drinking tasteful matcha stay away from this one. But as culinary grade matcha its certainly a good value."
4,Tea is good for you,"Drink tea. You'll like the tea. Especially the tea in the big tin. And if you drink enough of this tea, you'll be very healthy - or very awake and jittery. ONe of the two. Either way you can throw the tin at your neighbors when they are having another loud party outside. And that can't be bad."
4,May not be suitable for vegans,"The book is very good and have texts between recipes that deserves its own book. It's a nice reading and learning and can give you some insights about zen cooking, but traditional Soto Zen meals are vegan (this is a Rinzai Zen book) so I feel a little awkward about reading ""A Zen method to crack a hard boiled egg"". The recipes can be easily adapted to a vegan meal, but even so, it could be excluded completely without any loss. Why they insist to see animals as ""'food' provider"" and why waste 10 liters of water and 10kg of grains to 1 liter of milk or some not healthy eggs? I don't know, maybe neither them."
3,"Not Perfect: Should Have Re-released ""All Wrapped Up""","Back in the day I bought this 2 lp collection of all the Undertones 7"" singles, a' and b's called All Wrapped Up. Mind you the 12"" some of singles had live tracks and remixes not included sadly on the original vinyl. With that said True Confessions totally flounders in that they included the LP version (demo?) of Julie Ocean instead of the FAR superior and slick single version. To me this completely tarnishes this collection.....At least I have the out of print Best of Rykodisc release for cd completist sake...Over all however, this collection is amazing, well worth it...."
3,Good effort with One Great song.,"This one is a good effort but just does not live up to what one would expect from America's Greatest rock band. Its lackluster, in parts, but has one really great song called ""Still Waitin"" written and sang by GFRs drummer, Don Brewer. It is a great song and should have been a hit. BUT, GFR broke up and it was never promoted. There are some good songs on hear as well all written and sang By GFRs great Front-man Mark Farner; Rock N Roll American Style, El Salvador (an anti Communists song), Don't Lie to me and Life in Outer Space. This album also lakes some punch, do to the fact that Mel Schacher (GFR's Ground Breaking -Both Literally and fugitively-Bass Player) was not in GFR, in the 80s; BUT, This album (CD) is still a Must have for any GFR fan and it is better then most of the stuff coming out in the 80s. So I would think most hard rock fans would like this album (CD)."
2,Funk para fs,"Disco para completistas e fs do Grand Funk.Destaque para Rock & Roll American Style e El Salvador, que lembram um GFR forte e influenciador de tendncias.Junto com Grand Funk Lives, deixe para comprar por último."
3,Grateful for a white disc,"Although the photo on the website shows a white disc, the one sent to me is bright orange. So if you are not grateful for neon orange, you might want to consider another disc. Otherwise it's quite OK. Peace..."
2,Run Away! Run Away!,"The first VHS in this series with the first three episodes on itis some of the funniest television I have ever seen: The Slimy Prince Edmund, the obsequeous Baldrick and the witless Lord Percy are great fun, the supporting cast are wonderful. The writing is very clever.So what happened here? Did they accidentally burn their writers at the stake? Did they run out of time and decided to substitute frantic activity for plot? Did they just run out of ideas? It was a shame that they felt that they had to wrap it up like that.I would have been much happier if I had never watched these three shows. The first one was a bit of a snooze except for the Infanta of Spain's interpreter. The last two didn't even have that grace.I haven't seen any later ones although I do intend to forge on hoping to see some glimpse of the genius that informed the first episodes.Stranger, pass by on the other side of the road and leave this one lying in the ditch."
3,A bit disjointed,"I liked that the author separated sugar types by topics. However I found the chronological ordering within each chapter to be a bit confusing. The author seemed to jump back and forth in the time line in several chapters, stringing together unlikely groupings of subtopics. I was hoping for more historical accounting and recipes. I would say this is a good primer for an introduction to sweets, but is not very in depth."
3,HoHum,Routine procedural with a hidden treasure twist. Except for being placed in Havana it could be just about any book. Hardly noir as the blurbs on the cover said. And it may be my anti-communist prejudice but I somehow doubt whether the Cuban police and forensics are as professional as they're made out to be here.
4,Practical And Personal,"""Love, Hope, Faith: A Personal Journey Through Cancer"" not only tells a personal story but also gives great encouragement for those who are experiencing the very difficult journey that comes with the diagnosis of self or that of a loved one.Gaynel communicates her own heart honestly and clearly. The result is the kind of help you would find in a close friend who walks with you during the hard times. Her faith is tested but the Object of her faith is faithful and near to her all the way.It's the kind of read that will encourage you whether you are in a situation presently or not. As her pastor, I have had the privilege of seeing, first hand, the kind of strength that is available for those who trust completely, even through moments of questions and doubts."
3,Tucket's Ride,"""Tucket's Ride"", by Gary Paulsen is a good book. It has action and adventure emotion, and romance. One part of the story when Tucket takes aim with his rifle , but everyone else has there guns pointed at him and they all fired at the same time. If you like action books, than ""Tucket's Ride"" is the book for you."
5,Tuckets Ride,"The book that I am reading is called Tuckets Ride. It is the second book in the series. It is about a fifteen year-old boy named Tucket that travels with two orphans across the west. The three have had many scary experiences in there journey like being kidnapped by outlaws and others and always seem to escape.This is a great book by Gary Paulsen. He describes the places they are at, the weather and the looks of things really well. He makes it easy to picture these things. This book is full of adventure and surprises. This book made me want to read it more since I am about his age. It is a good book to me because as I mentioned about my age and going through stuff, like kidnapping, that other people my age go through.During the whole book it is kind of like a history lesson because Paulsen gives information about the Wild West."
5,"""I work in advertising, so I was naturally curious about this DVD""","""I work in advertising, so I was naturally curious about this DVD. What shocked me the most is how many of the elements that are used in advertising today are already being used - more than 60 years ago. It's fascinating"""
3,Boring as hell,"I drudged my way through the early chapters of this book. Most all-star topics in epidemiology are reliably laid out there. Unfortunately, the book is boring as hell. The one time I tried to use one of examples given in the book to calculate something (power or sample size?) I got hopelessly lost - the layout does not allow formulas to stand out. I found class notes and handouts much more useful than this book."
4,Good reference,"I think this book,Methods in Observational Epidemiology, might be very good reference to many scientists, especially biostatistist or epidemiologists."
1,Terrible Red Rash,"This was the second J&J scented baby oil gel I tried and it was the same thing, a very bad contact dermatitis developed a few days after I used it. There must be an ingredient that is in all their baby oil gels that causes this rash. I cannot recommend this product in any fragrance."
1,Made in China,"I did not realize Oscar Schmidt was farming out their production to China. Of all things, an autoharp MADE IN CHINA stamped on the inside? With everything nowadays made there, try to find something made in the USA. Oscar Schmidt is over 100 years old, and I had researched on their website, so this was a complete surprise, and disappointment to me. I sent it back. I cannot have an instrument Made In China! Went to EBay and found a vintage autoharp made earlier, made here in the USA."
2,Disappointing B&W video,"Be warned- this is a grainy B@W video of early BBC shows. Quite grainy, no dancing girls,bawdy skits etc.despite the title. It is also part of the Benny Hill Gift Selection. Frankly, I felt ripped off."
5,VERY comprehensive with a great John Inman section...,"Great book for fans of ""Are You Being Served?"" and it's spin-offs!! Detailed synopsis' of each episode including the Australian and doomed American versions! END"
2,"Great idea, if it works!","I love Skagen watches! I thought this one would be great, different colours for different outfits with the three bands. BUT 2 of the bands were incorrectly made and could not be fastened onto the watch case. Had to return the set. Disappointed!"
1,Great Show - Bad DVD,I've already returned Season One to get a replacement as the second disc won't play (attempted on three different players). Now I have to return the replacement as the second disc won't play. So I guess it's a production run gone bad. This is really unfortunate because I love the show.
4,Ballykissangel Complete series 1,"This series is about a Priest who comes to a small Irish Village called Ballykissangel and meets first the pub owner , Asumpta, who in turn, introduces him to some of the other characters in the village as we get to know them too. I enjoyed this series very much. Watching this series, I began to really feel like I was a part of the town. If you're looking for a series that has not been shown on American TV, I highly reccommend this one."
3,Season 1+ Bally-,I really enjoyed the entire series of Ballykissangel... until Asumpta died and Father Peter loses it moral compass over her! Then I couldn't go on with the new priests and the modernist break with the Church.
3,How' s your Irish brogue?,"Where's the Closed Captioning?Dialogue very difficult to understand.B-plus as a crime drama. Good performance by leading character (""DCI Banks""). Some interesting rural Ireland photography."
5,a tv series worth watching!,"Let's face it. We all have our favourite programs to watch, whether it is an hbo tv series, the news, the comedy channel, or a nice BBC program for us to view here in america. Ballykissangel just happens to be the one of the best bbc programs I have ever seen. I just hope they keep putting more of them on video to enjoy as our local stations don't show them in a steady stream."
5,This is Weihnacht,"I used to own this years ago on 8 track and played it until it died. I grew up listening to Peter and being 1st generation German, this album has all the songs that 'meine Mutter' listened to and so did we. Peter truly has wonderful voice. So Bayrisch!"
5,Smile Starter,"Listening to this CD ensures that a smile will appear on my face and stay there throughout the entire CD. The songs are done in a delightful combination of children's choir alternating with Peter Alexander. The happiness in the children's sounds, in combination with the relaxing tones of Peter Alexander himself, make this the perfect CD to rekindle the Christmas spirit and, if you are lucky enough to have visited the Germanic countries, the nostalgia of happy vacations."
3,Food For Thought,"A well written and practical book for the real estate practioner. Kennedy in her usual style approaches her subject material in a straight forward and common sense manner. Her advice and insight clearly stems from her years of experience as a realtor in the trenches. I rate this book as a must read for anyone wanting to enhance or increase their income with real estate sales while seeking to obtain a more balanced lifestyle. J.L. Wall, Knoxville, Tennessee"
4,Great amp 4 a very good price!,"I bought this amp last week and I have to 15"" subs hooked up to this B. I must say that I was totally impressed with the proformance this amp gave me and never once did it run hot or gave up on me."
3,Pyle Amp,"I took a chance to buy this product, so far it is working fine for me, i am going to get more top of the line amps later, but i am happy"
1,sucks,"said it was new, but box had big dent when i got it, and no fuses, white marks all over top, obviously used and didn't work correctly"
3,Philosophy of the Technique,"This is an interesting discussion of the philosophy behind the technique. It is not pragmatic, in that it is more theoretical than actual suggestions. You must have an instructor for this to make any sense."
3,Not exactly as the picture!,This poster is great but it doesn't have the letter prints where it says pink floyd and the dark side of the moon but it still looks great on my wall!
3,nice,"It is nice but I had hoped the colors would be more vibrant that they are. Still, my husband likes it so I am happy too."
3,not as pictured,"I was excited to get this poster, and chose to get it over another because in the picture it showed the there was text saying ""Pink Floyd"" and ""Dark Side Of The Moon"". Once I got it, it didn't have that on it. Also the colors could be a tad more vivid. Otherwise, I still hung it up since I already have it here."
5,perfect album and poster,"perfect album, although i think the wall is better this is a perfect album. and the poster looks sweet to, the rainbow realy pops"
1,Looks like a kid created this poster,Crap colors. no text on mine... what can I say? No writing on this wall... besides a bad comment for this poster and company.
5,BEST BRIAN MCKNIGHT EVER!,I truly love this CD!!! I play it to death.. I will need a new one before long becaue I am wearing grooves in this one... Highly recommend this CD
3,Where is the Real Brian?,"I do love Brian McKnight; I am a huge fan. On this CD I was looking for the true Brian Mcknight; the ""One last Cry"" Brian Mcknight, the 6, 8, 12, Brian Mcknight, the ""Back At One"" Brian Mcknight, the ""Thinkin Bout Me""(Nutty Professor Soundtrack) Brian Mcknight and the even the ""Crazy Love"" Brian Mcknight that you heard in the past but I didnt really hear a lot of the TRUE Brian Mcknight on this album. The songs, ""I DO"", ""A little too late"", and ""More and More"" are the best songs because that is the real Brian. It seems that he is trying be someone else that he is not. I dont know if he is trying to be hip-hop or what. In my opinion Brian did his best music when he was married."
4,Bryan Mcknight,"If you love Bryan Mcknight you will like this cd. The first listen to it's not as addicting as his previous two albums, but give it a second listen through and u'll appreciate it like no ohter."
3,I wanna feel you but its hard this time...,"That should be the name of one of your songs, Brian.I love Brian McNight. He had me at One Last Cry. Being an author, I've written wondeful stories with his soulful voice and been to heave and back auditorilyI love his voice, his music and have supported him just because I'm addicted to himThat's why its so difficult to say that this time, Brian, I just... I just couldn't feel the same passion.Although when you sang on Steve Harvey, those songs you sang sounded better there live (which made me run and get the CD) than on the CD.I love you like a man I've loved a long time Brian, and I've listeend to all you have done, but I just didn't feel the passion like before. The lyrics were good, but I just couldn't hear the Brian that I fell in love with in the past."
3,Better than average but still not that album,"I'm a Big Brian Mcknight fan. He is One of the Most talented Singer, Songwriters, Musicians,etc.. in the Business. but His Albums don't always showcase the full zenith of his musical talents. this Album has a cut like Used to be My Girl"" which is cool,but alot of the tracks while Versatile in stylings&Sound he has already touched on. it's one thing to craft a track&it's another to leave a lasting impression with a track. that is the difference here. I like a few of the cuts,but there isn't that One cut that fully brings him back to where he once was. still Brian Mcknight is a Artist who should be getting more attention than he is.I still dig His first two albums the best overall from him."
1,"Red, white, and blue.","The only song I wanted off of this album was 'red, white and blue' featuring Rascal Flatts, but for some reason, that's the only song where you have to purchase the entire album to hear! This is ridiculous."
4,Good value if you know what to expect,"No, this is not sweeter than honey nor regular sugar nor even artificial sweetener. However, it has the maple flavor that I need to add to certain winter cocktails (hot buttered rum, replacing some of the dark brown sugar with this) and to tea. If you are expecting something super potent and super maple, like maple sugar candy, this ain't it. It's what you'd expect from something that is pure and not artificially enhanced with other sugars or maple flavoring. I'm satisfied and I think anyone would be IF they have proper expectations."
4,Loved Quebec,"Last fall I visited Quebec City and fell in love with maple syrup. Now I'm back home and would like to do some baking, only problem is finding good and affordable maple sugar. I found it with Coombs. No wonder, I already use the syrup they produce. This maple sugar is delicious and wonderful in baking. Loved it."
2,Disappointed,Really nothing special. Description said twice as sweet as regular sugar & only need to use half as much. We didn't find that to be so. The tast of maple was hardly evident. Really not worth the high price.
3,Don't Really taste a difference from regular sugar,I must be honest this is a decent price for this type of sugar. I tried it once before at a coffee shop and enjoyed it in my coffee with milk. But now since trying this brand I don't really taste much of a difference from that of regular sugar. Like I said this is a lower price than most other offering this type of sugar but don't think ill spend that much on sugar again...
2,Pricey,"I had never tried maple sugar before, so I really can't compare it to another brand. We thought that the taste was very good. We like to sprinkle it on oatmeal. It would certainly not be cost effective to use in baking. At $16 or so a pound I cannot justify the cost. We really couldn't tell the difference between this and the $3/lb organic sucanat I found at the food coop."
2,Unattractive designs,"I returned this book eventually.This book covers some important issues such as selecting tools and lumbers, and overall has done a good job explaining the building steps. However, I found the majority of the projects ""dated"" and unattractive."
4,"its pearly gates,by the way.","i saw these guys in calgary,and they blew the offspring and the vandals offstage.""faust pt.2""(way better than the ""short music.."" version) is just awesome,as is ""these valley streets"" and ""lolita"",""kill security now"", and the final track, the cover of the cars ""just what i needed"",which is much better than the original,and sounds like it was written for them. the sound is standard 90's punk production,with blazing clear guitars.not much varity,but thats not what bands like this are here for.better than most of the skate-punk thats out there right now.the songs that dont stand out are not weak,and this is an album you can put on from begining to end."
5,Great brush for all hair types....,"I have 2 daughters, 1 has long very curly (ringlet type)hair and 1 has long wavy hair. This brush works great on both. Use it right out of the shower and it makes detangling a dream. I don't even need detangling spray anymore. You do need to make a final run through with a comb because it doesn't 100% of the tangles out, but about 95% and it makes for a scream/whine free time. You need this brush!!"
3,Detangler Brush 3 out of 5 stars,"I recently ordered the wet detangler brush from amazon. It was a good deal and shipped quickly, but it didn't work for my thick wavy hair. I tried using it in the shower, and it did nothing. I tried using it out of the shower, and it did nothing. My husband then used it on our dog who has wiry fur, and it worked. It managed to take out all the little dreads she gets on her legs. So in all I don't love the brush but my dog sure does."
2,THey Dont Brush Hair Very Well,"My daughter likes the brushes, but she is only 6 yrs old. You can use it and it may work right and my not, the knots never go away unless you brush for 20 min. They are cheap and everything which is good, but I would not ever buy another one again."
4,works great,this works i didnt have to pull at my hair it was very gentle made the task of brushing less time consuming and violent..my hair is a ltl on the curly side just dont use it with a blow dryer the bristles will bend.
1,odor,"The brush had such a strong odor that we cannot use it. I cannot tell if its a bad plastic smell or a smoke smell. I have tried soaking it, etc. This is the 3rd wet brush I have ordered and the only one that has smelled so badly that I couldn't use it."
5,GREAT for detangling on natural hair,"I purchased this brush after watching a video review by jcokes7 and was impressed. I've used the Wet Brush with great ease on my kinky, coily hair. It glides through my hair with ease once I've misted it with water and applied conditioner. This is a must-have for any woman with natural hair, as detangling is super easy."
1,Breaks hair,"I got this and the tangle teezer at the same time. This brush does not work. My daughter has fine, silky hair and I have medium, wavy hair. It took me forever to get tangles out with a wide tooth comb. I saw someone from the long haired communities review on the tangle teezer so I thought I'd get that and try this (since it was cheaper). The tangle teezer is really amazing. I'm done in 1/2 the time with 3/4 less hair in the brush. Don't waste your money on this...go for the tangle teezer!!"
3,"Good with dry hair, disappointing with wet hair","I bought this because it was recommended by my sister-in-law and hair-brushing time with my daughter has always been a battle. I had hoped this would make it a little better, and it has to a degree. When my daughter's hair is dry, this brush pulls less than any of the other brushes I've ever used. There is still some snagging, but not nearly as much as there used to be. My daughter has thick, fine, curly hair. When my daughter's hair is wet - this brush is just as bad about pulling as any other brush on wet hair. I won't be using the ""wet"" brush on her wet hair ever again.Since it's also labeled for adult use, I've tried it on my very thick, curly hair and found it didn't work very well. I'll stick to thick-tined combs."
2,Not comfortable at all,"Not sure about the detangle part, but this brush hurts when you use it.It's very uncomfortable. At the end I bought Conair Anti Static Paddle Brush from Amazon.It feels so much better.I'm still keeping this one though. It's so cheap, not worth it to return it."
2,Eh...I don't really notice a difference!,"I like the brush, but I don't really notice a difference in brushing between this one and the regular brush I got from the store. My daughter and I both have long thick hair. It is still pretty difficult to get the tangles out. I have to take the hair in sections. Again, good brush but nothing special."
4,IT REALLY WORKS!!!,"My boyfriend got this for me as a stocking gift, which i thought it was weird!!! But after i used it, i thought it was the most thoughtful gift ever. my hair is really tangled after a shower and with the brush, it doesnt hurt or have to pull hard when brushing my hair. I LOVE IT! and i couldnt live with out this brush."
2,NOT for thick hair and not for use in shower!,"Glad that they sent me purple but that is all I like about. First of all, the impression I got from the description is that I could use it in the shower. But I don't think you can, on the BACK of the package it says use right AFTER the shower. Secondly, the bristles are short and thin. And that is probably the only kind of hair it works on - short and thin. It will probably work great a little girls hair too. I think I'm going to give it to my niece since I cannot use it at all. Glad it wasn't very expensive."
3,This is not a miracle brush...,"So I ordered this brush after reading the other reviews and was expecting it to instantly detangle my daughter's knot-prone hair. It didn't. It does work well on children's hair (and my own as well) when it is wet or dry. But, if the hair is very knotty (as my daughter's is), this does not work wonders. It's ok for the price but will not do anything super."
5,Perfect for extensions,"I had gotten this brush from my friends salon, and it's great if you have hair extensions. Extensions can be pricey as I know! The Wet brush won't rip at them, and it brushes right through with no snags. :)"
5,Great brush for fine hair,"My 2 year old has very fine hair that tangles very easily. Before I bought this brush at my salon, it would take about 5 minutes to comb her hair even with conditioner and detangler. That job takes less than a minute now. She doesn't cry or squirm while brushing her hair. I loved this brush so much that I bought 2 for our house and one for each set of grandparents. I won't use any other brush. I would recommend this brush to anyone. Wouldn't have believed that this brush was so good if I hadn't seen it for myself. This is one product that's definitely not too good to be true. Love it.The price on Amazon is amazing. I paid $10 each at my salon and paid less than $7 with shipping to my door on Amazon. Shipping was fast too. Received it within 3 days of ordering. Wish I would've thought about Amazon before I bought 3 at $10 a pop at my salon. At least I got this one for a good deal."
5,Better than the competition,"While this cannot perform miracles, compared to my previous brush it gets more tangles less painfully and more quickly. Not only that, but it is completely waterproof and it is extremely cheap. For this price range there is no better. Only problem is that some of the tines are not as well made as the others, but this does not noticeably impact the effectiveness of the brush nor are imperfections rough or likely to damage or catch hair. Got a nice bright pink color."
5,Great Detangling Brush,"The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush is great! I used to have a lot of difficulty combing through my hair after washing it, and I lost some hair and had broken ends in the process. Using the Wet Brush, I am now able to brush out the tangles in my wet hair without it hurting and without any hair loss."
4,Great for long hair,"With this brush I can brush my hair right out of the shower without using detangler or leave-in conditioner. I have very thick, long hair and although it is always difficult to get out some tangles, this brush really helps. I use it everyday and it has lasted a long time. Only a few bristles bent from being shoved in a drawer (on accident) but other than that it still works great and would buy again."
1,I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE OTHER REVIEWS - CHEAP $1 BRUSH,"This is not a quality soft flexible brush with rubber, like Conair. It is a no-brand cheap product, that sells for $1 AT MY LOCAL ONE DOLLAR STORE! I JUST SAW IT THERE FOR ONE DOLLAR.The quality of the product is low, and the description does not say that it is not rubberized very well, it scratches and it does not detangle when wet...."
3,Well...,"Works great, I won't lie.But they gave me pink... I'm a guy... had to give to someone and order another one... I know colours vary but I feel like they should at least be a little conscious of pink colour..."
2,Do You Receive One or Five Brushes?,"The brush is good. My little ones are happy with it. However, it bothers me that sellers are allowed to present their product showing more than one of the item. Maybe I am foolish, but in this case, it led me to believe that I was ordering a set of brushes."
5,Love this brush!,"Brushing through my tangles were once painful and dreadful, but with this brush, combing through my hair is a lot more pleasant and comfortable. I use this brush everyday now and I can't imagine using any other brush."
5,NEVER PLAN TO USE ANOTHER BRUSH!!,Great brush. I got one for me and one for my family. I use it on both wet and dry hair. My hair tangles and this works right through it. I am sold on this brush and will have to buy another one when or if this one wears out!
3,"Really, it is just another brush.","It works fine (I mean it is a brush)... but, I haven't noticed that it reduces tangles or anything?? I would not recommend this for that purpose... but, if you need a new brush, this will work! :o)"
4,Works well,"This brush doesnt look like much but it is great at untangling my hair, especialy wet hair. This is the best brush ever invented! It works...we have 2 in our apartement! It is gentle on the scalp but takes out the tangles without any painful pulling. My sister got me one for my birthday, this is the best brush I have used for untangling."
1,detangles ok but is harsh on the scalp,"the bristles on this brush are extremely harsh, if you run it along your arm, for instance, using moderate pressure, slightly raised, red welts will appear. i really don't want to be causing abrasions to my scalp, as that can lead to dandruff. gross. also, the brush detangles well..to a point. when i use it closer to the roots of my hair, it really does not work at all."
2,Strong smell,I read the other reviews and still took a chance ordering the brush...as soon as I opened the package I could smell it. I'm not sure how to describe it other than a toxic smell.
5,works better than i imagined it would,"Completely worth it! My salon sells this exact brush for $15 and it works like a hot knife through butter on my super long, super fine, tangly hair. I'm thinking about buying another to keep at the boyfriends place actually..."
2,This brush does not work on wet wavy or curly hair,"My daughter's really do no like having their wavy hair brushed when wet. I bought this brush thinking that it would help make the process easier and a little less painless. I WAS WRONG. This brush does not make brushing wet hair easier, in fact, it appears to cause a lot of discomfort and breakage. Great concept but not practical. I do not recommend this brush."
3,I think my hair is just too thick...,"It does detangle wet hair, but if your hair is long, thick and curly like mine, it takes quite a while to brush through all the tangles. Some tangles are too stubborn for this brush, and oftentimes I lose patience and end up just brushing my hair with a regular brush (when wet). This is a great brush for thinner hair that does not tangle easily. Great concept though; just didn't work wonders for me..."
5,The Wet Brush,A friend had given me one of these brushes and I found it amazing. I always had to use a detangling solution before. The new brush is so good at detangling that I didn't need anything else. I ordered 4 more to give to family and friends and kept an extra as a backup. Great Product!
4,shower brush,purchased the wet brush rubberized wet detangle shower brush for both of my daughters; they are happy with them and work well
3,Nice brush however....,Nice quality brush -but i was sent the black one. I had purchased this for my 9 year old daughter - I wish you could choose your color - she will not like the black brush! I wanted any color but black :(
5,Amazing brush...,"I have medium length thick coarse hair which is very frizzy. Normally after washing my hair, I would let it dry out and then use a wide-toothed comb to brush my hair. The comb would detangle my hair but there was still a lot of hair fall due to tugging and pulling. After looking at all the glowing reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy the wet brush. And I was impressed the first time I used it.The bristles are soft but firm and it goes through hair smoothly-both wet and dry. Hairfall due to brushing and combing has been reduced a lot. I have also noticed less static hair, and as a result fewer flyaways.Its a good bursh for its price. If you are looking for a hairbrush to buy, you have nothing to lose by buying this one. Even if it doesn't work as well on your hair as it did on mine, at its worst, its still just a hair brush which burshes."
5,LOVE THIS BRUSH,"This is the best brush ever! It's the only brush I can use where my daughter won't cry and I can brush right through my washed, wet hair with no problems. I LOVE IT!!!"
3,Beware of Outside Vendors....,"Beware when ordering this brush from an outside vendor (Limited Quantity in my case). The brush was an older version and did not work as well compared to the multi colored ones (which I would rate 5 stars). If you get a black brush with a black logo, you're not getting the brush pictured."
4,Seemed to work well at first,"Like most people who would shop for a product like this, I was looking for something to make the hair brushing task a little easier on my kids. The first couple of times it was used, they said it was better. After a few uses though, the complaints started back up again. Don't think it is the brushes fault as it looks the same, nothing has broken off or anything, it could just be that my kids were expecting it to be easier the first couple of times so maybe they tricked themselves into thinking it was better. At any rate, its a decent quality brush for the price, I would recommend giving it a shot, it just hasn't worked the miracles I was hoping for in my case."
4,Wow this really does work,"The last brush I was using for brushing my wet hair literally snapped in half but this was after several years of usage so I wasn't upset just surprised. I was looking on Amazon for a new one when I came across these, after reading the reviews I decided to try and and have not been disappointed. This is the best brush I've probably ever used. I have medium length slightly curly hair that after getting highlighted can be very tangly. This brush easily works through the tangles and snags without hurting. My only concern is that some of the bristles are starting to bend already which is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
5,Excellent,"The best brush I have owned!!! So nice, very efficient , and never hurts or pull the hair especially after shower!"
5,Loved this Product!,"My daughter-in-law and granddaughter have long, thick, curly hair. We have tried so many products. I saw this product rated in a newspaper and tried it. They both loved it. It did not pull on the hair and also there was hardly any hair left in the brush after using. My granddaughter is young and it took hours to detangle her hair so this is a time saver!! Definitely recommend this product."
4,"Works, but not in way intended","Nice brush, but doesn't work on my thick curly hair. I can imagine that if you have straight hair that this would be a better brush. The dogs just love the feel as I brush them after their bath. It is a fantastic dog brush and that is why I gave it 4 stars."
4,Works great!,"I have long, straight hair and I needed a comb that would go straight through and not get caught in the tangles. This did the trick."
3,Less pain but causes frizz,"This brush is really a lot softer and using it is a lot less painful than other brushes. However, after using it several times on my wavy hair and my toddler daughter's curly hair, I noticed that it causes a lot of frizz and my hair is typically not that frizzy. Now, I have yet to try it on wet hair, and it very well may work better under those circumstances. However, the product also advertises that it works on dry hair too - just be aware that it may cause hair to be frizzier than hard-brissled brushes."
4,Not sure why it works...but it does!,It looks and feels like a regular brush...but somehow it manages to glide through all those tangles without pulling or breaking the hair. Incredible! If you hair is super knotted then you need to brush it out in smaller sections.
5,I LOVE this brush,"Having VERY long, THICK hair, I do NOT know how I've lived w/out this brush for so long!!! Does wonders on both wet and dry hair, no more pain trying to get through the knots, very nice rubbery grip to it."
5,Best brush for thick hair!,"My daughter has long, thick hair & brushing it was always a fight. This brush works great on wet or dry hair & now when I tell her to brush her hair she does it right away with no arguments at all."
4,great for long hair and for kids,"I bought this for myself - I have long, fine, color-treated hair. I had to use LOTS of leave-in conditioner & detangler before, with this brush I still use some product, but MUCH less. It also works great on my three-year son's hair."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I should really post a video review of me using the brush so you can see how terrible it is, but I'm not home at the moment.I bought this brush based on the fabulous reviews, and was immediately disappointed. Yes, it doesn't really hurt, but it's also not very effective at detangling. By the time I can get it through my hair with ease it's already ripped and broken a ton of hair. Because it's breaking my hair, I'm getting even MORE knots.Even though I recently bought this, I'm now in the market for a better brush. This one is too frustrating and makes my hair frizzy from the breakage. I've never had this problem with a brush before, but it's enough to make me write a review."
4,Amazing as can be,"Steggo,my Stegosaurus, is very well made. But the day I opened him after school, his head was detached! We glued it back on with our hot glue gun and he seemed to be alright. He is very well painted and, if you look closely, you'll see scales! I hope you will enjoy him very,very much!"
3,"Mathew Dear, move on","Well composed, but lifeless.There are times when clicks and blips work to make for interesting and wonderful music as with Autechre, and to some degree Plastikman, but there is nothing that feels original and interesting here. Move on Dance/IDM seekers."
2,Boring.,"There's really nothing to say about this album. After listening to it 5 times, I couldn't discern one song from another."
5,Elvis Presley & Frank Sinatra,"Pls, you will can to put some musics to that all can listen too, the beautiful music between Elvis and Frank Sinatra."
5,"Very, VERY funny","Here's a British TV comedy series that puts American sit-coms to shame with its biting wit and comic sensibilities. Black Adder surpasses Mr. Bean (which I also enjoy) and is up there with Fawlty Towers. It helps to know some English history and some Shakespeare, but not necessary. (My 11-year-old son loves the series.) I just discovered the Black Adder tapes at the video rental and am working my way through them. Saw II - Part 1 last night, and this is some VERY funny stuff. Some of the humor is rather daring for the period this was made (a LOT of sexual humor generally and the gender-bending of ""Bells"" specifically), but I guess British TV was more relaxed than the American networks back in the early 80s. Every time Black Adder encounters witches, it's a hilarious take on those Shakespeare plays you read in high school."
4,...,"As a former dancer, abuse survivor and 13-year-old girl, I can't start to tell you how real this book was to me. The thoughts and emotions that Mr. Benjava describes are all real - including the playful innocence that is left in some 13 year olds.I was able to feel what it was like to dance, to have my first teenage crush and be a silly teen all over again. It was a bit difficult to get through some of the abuse parts, but what we live through just makes us stronger - and I believe that even though Nikki is a fictional character we all have a part of her in all of us."
3,Full steam ahead,"From the minute you put it in the player this CD erupts into a rollicking flow of sound. It's fast and seems to get faster until about halfway through the CD where they've got some rap/hip-hop stuff and where there is a twice repeated expletive, but it's in Hungarian so who cares. After that the speed picks up again until it seems almost frenetic in places.This is a band and not just your traditional Hungarian music. They mix a bunch of different styles and instruments, even using a little tongue clicking for percussion. It's a creative, snappy style, but most of the songs are very repetitive. Lots of brass in the mix, so the songs sound very similar in style.Overall a great CD for when you want to get up and move to something energizing."
3,Dean Vendetta 1.0 Electric Guitar - Review,"Overall this is a nice looking guitar. Can't beat the price and nice sound. I just did not like that the neck (behind) is not finished (polished), so I may have to do it myself because sending it out would defeat the purpose of the purchase price. Other than that, nice guitar for the price."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I've been biding my time, waiting for a decent price on this Dean...It arrived in excellent condition, set-up is VERY close to perfect, even the intonation was spot-on.No buzzing frets, holds tune..... VERY fast neck, and 24 frets is a bonus for an old player like me.What REALLY stopped me was the finish - this is easily one of the Most Beautiful guitars in my collection now !If you need a fine practice / backup guitar, BUY THIS DEAN !"
1,Don't bother,"Regardless of where you stand on the ECT/Anti-ECT controversy, I don't think you'll find this book to be worth your time. It appears to be designed as an anti-ECT tome, but I would have a lot of trouble citing any of its points in a debate."
1,History Masquerading as Fantasy,"I will not continue reading this series. So far the plot is simply a retelling of the Crusades with heavy-handed philosophy and fantasy elements sprinkled in. Western religious leader (the Pope) commissions a Holy War (Crusade) against the heathens to retake the holy city (Jerusalem). The eastern Emperor wants to use the war to retake lands that used to belong to his empire (Byzantium). Not only is this a completely unoriginal premise, it is not compellingly told."
5,Awesome Book,I loved this book from beginning to end. Its epicness reminded me of the Erikson and Martin books and I will for sure be getting the next in this series.There is something special about a storyline that takes place thousands of years after an apocalypse and possibly close to another.
3,"Worth reading, but nothing special here","All around a decent book but nothing ground breaking here. A pretty quick read that's a little confusing to start but picks up well. Characters are not equally developed, some are powerful and unforgettable, others motivations are difficult to comprehend and under developed.World building aspects are reasonable but once again nothing special. Other titles in the genre are much more rewarding. If you're more a fan of 'epic' fantasy with highly developed characters and worlds I'd look else where [Martin, Hobbs, Erikson], if you're looking for a quick entertaining read this will be worth your while. There is enough here to hold out hope that the next volumes will be more compelling."
1,The Darkness that Comes before...is a bore!,"We start with a terrific prologue introducing a fascinating character...who is missing for page after page after page. (I'm at 305 and still haven't been reintroduced to him, but I plug on.) Characters are confusing. His character list is at the back of the book, not at the front, so one just muddles along trying to figure out who's who and who's from where. Bakker is so busy introducing characters (with too similar names) and describing scenes, and the angst! But he forgets to get his plot moving. Tolkien, too, came up with a complicated world, but he chose a character that one could identify with, and pushed him out into the world where we followed along.This promises to be another Robert Jordan going on forever and ever and ever unto the 9th or is it 10th power and one finally just plain gives up. I'm giving up now and thanking my lucky stars it was a library book. I'd never give it shelf-space."
4,Great despite the denseness of the prose,"This book is very rewarding if you are able to muddle through the ridiculous names of people and places. This is not a book to read quickly because of the difficult pronunciation for EVERTHING!. Underneath the authors obsession with creating a smart world populated with strange names is an entirely original fantasy novel. Yes, original. Can you believe it.To compare it to George RR Martin is acceptable, however it is more brutal story (which is a good thing), has a more original plot that is not as tight or interesting and the characters are not as well fleshed out. Oh but it is close. However, that is a cruel comparison since I believe the Song of Ice and Fire to be the best series ever. So,read this and enjoy it, it is close to a perfect fantasy, so close."
5,Drew me into fantasy,"I've never really been one for fantasy, but after reading about this on Amazon.ca's site, I picked it up and was thoroughly blown away by the intrinsic philosophies and metaphysics, and the developed characters. Plot turns keep it intrigueing.If you're a fan of Clive Barker, Frank Herbert, or more cerebral fantasy, then you'll be an instant Bakker fan. His writing style is poetic and erudite, and very much his own.The Prince of Nothing series has quickly become one of my favourite stories ever. If you're not into complex epics, however, such as Dune, perhaps skip this and come back to it when you're more comfortable with the number of characters and its depth of meaning."
2,Sadly not for me,"After reading multiple reviews I bought the book. Unfortunately I just couldn't get into it. The story moved at a snail's pace, while jumping from character to character. I understand the style of writing used but I just couldn't connect with the characters at all, and didn't really care what they were doing. This is all just my personal experience, others may love this book."
5,"Hard to get into, but worth it once you do.",Takes about 300 pages to get into. Second and third books in trilogy are very readable however.
3,A good start,"This book is all background to what may happen in the next two books.The plot is all over the place and it doesn't seem until the last 250 pages that the author knows where he wants to go with the story and finally concentrates on the most interesting characters.I recommend the book as a good opener for the next two books(...)Hopefully, the next two books are less background and more substance.A few unique and very interesting characters (especially khellus who sadly disapears for a lot of the book) make the book worth while, but dont mistake this for George RR Martin....yet."
2,A struggle to get through,"Pros: the author has some skill as a word-smith, no dispute there. The world he has created is interesting and unlike anything I've come across before. The writing is nuanced and mature for the genre.Cons: the story drags terribly. I think the author is a philosophy grad student and it shows. The philosophical digressions get rather old and drag down the story.I agree that it is confusing, with all the unfamiliar names, etc., but Tolkien is confusing too, until you spend some time with him, so I'm not sure how fair of a criticism that is (NOT that I'm comparing this guy to Tolkien--it's not even close...) It would have been better if there would have been more back-story, more explanation and background for this elaborate setting.In the end, however, it all comes back to the story: SLOW and DULL. This book is a struggle to get through, which is too bad because the author has definite talent."
1,Ugh!,I know other people gave this a good review and that's fine but i have to say that I couldn't even finish this book. It could not hold my interest at all. There are much better books out there than this. I was over 100 pages in and still had no clue what was happening. Really not that good.
1,Pretentious,"I should have known better than to start reading a book that has a quote from Nietzsche at the front. The writing is a combination of pretentiousness and cliches. It would have been sufferable if it were one or the other, but the two together just make it excruciating.Quote: ""A calligraphy of cries. The thud of astonished flesh. He speared the ecstasy from their inhuman faces, stepped among them and snuffed out their beating hearts.""The whole darn book is written like this. I suppose that's not such a big deal on its own. But in combination with how the characters are written it's too much for me. The main character is an arrogant idiot--exceptionally pompous--and yet he is described by the author in admiration. Have you ever known someone with an enormously over-inflated opinion of their own intellect? That person would be this book, incarnate.I can't bring myself to finish it, though I've tried several times."
4,Impressive work of fantasy,"R. Scott Bakker's first novel is impressive in it's originality.It is difficult to find this in the fantasy genre, where every other book is a clone of Lord of the Rings or Dungeons & Dragons. Bakker manages to incorporate action, mystery, religion and politics into the lives of several unconventional heroes.The story is told first-person and each characters internal dialog is unique and gives a distinct portrait of their lives, troubles, and motivations. This is something that Robert Jordan has lost hold of with his ""Wheel of Time"" series.I highly recommend this book to readers looking for unique fantasy. This book is a solid first of a series and the second is even better."
1,Good name for a series...pity everything else fails dismally,"I couldn't tell the difference between any of the places or people in this book. Nor was the plot intriguing enough to convince me that I should care.There was a review posted about this book that quoted some of the most ugly sentences ever penned. Which is indicative of this whole book.I won't bother finishing this book, let alone consider reading the others in the series."
2,A Disappointing Debut,"Mr. Bakker's debut fantasy is, in a word, disappointing. The story is a rather bland one, and you cannot really feel for the characters as much as you should in fantasy novels. This book is also very hard to sit down and read. Bakker's prose is extremely clunky (almost to the point that it is impenetrably poetic) and difficult to follow coherantly. Your best bet is to borrow the book from a library, or from a friend who was stupid enough to buy it."
2,I really wanted this to be a great series,"I loved the title of this book, and the series title... However, the content I found confusing, way way too detailed, and nothing about the characters that really peaked my interest and had me wanting to know what happened to them. Added to that, each time a new character was introduced, I got more and more confused as to where in the world the story was headed...not a clue, nor did it intrigue me to find out where the story was headed.The set up took way too long.. I got to page eighty five, and the set up still wasn't finished, and I was bored outta my mind.I'd recommend Robert Jordan, Lorna Freeman, Greg Keyes, or E.E. Knight"
2,Should be more then the start of a series,"I kept wanting to like this book. The writing style is good. The world is well fleshed out. But nothing ever quite clicks. The rapid changes in point of view lead to no character being developed well enough. I found I really just didn't care. I was never engaged by the story.Several reviewers have said ""Give it time, it's the beginning of a series."" I say, why would I want to slog though 577 pages of a book that can't stand on it's own."
4,impressive world building,"'The Darkness That Comes Before' is the first novel in the 'Prince of Nothing' series. As usual with first books in this type of epic fantasy, there is a lot of history and introductions to people and places with strange names. Bakker has done a very good job world building, and a good job explaining the relationships between various nations and factions. Basically he has taken the idea of the Crusades and transferred them to a fantasy setting. Overlaying this is hints that an ancient evil, once responsible for an apocalypse thousands of years ago, is returning and may in fact be manipulating current events. All in all a lot of work for the reader but also lot of fun. This is how I like my fantasy; solid back story, plenty of intrigue, action, sorcery and magic, and ancient evils."
3,it could be a little more action packed,"this book seems good...although sometimes i feel like i must be reading it for a class and not for pleasure. i don't really like how it leaves the main character for half the book, and all th enames get confusing, but i have a feeling as the series progresses it will get better."
2,Worth finishing?,I have 10 pages left to finish the book. Since this is the first in a series I know that there will be no conclusion at the end. So what it comes down to is whether or not the book was good enough to make me want to continue on to Book 2. Those last 10 pages are going to remain unread.
2,obscure meanings,"i have never read book of the author beforehis name came by by luck in a net search and i tried one to see what it is likethe story is obscure, too much manipulation, difficult names, histories of unheard countriesthe scenario is in fact a mix of stories that are not totally relatedthe characters are well developed in the contrary, but in the end the whole thing wouldn't steer me to buy the next books to find out what will happenalso i am not inclined to read anything from the same author because his writing style and philosophical ideas (that are given in long dialogues or monologues)."
2,10 lbs of flotsam in a 5 lb bag...,"One can almost forgive the author his credentials; BA in English, MA in theory, and working on a PhD in philosophy, if only this first effort did not smack of pretentious over-think. The compelling urge to impress shuffles aside the urge to tell the story and what remains is an overly complex morass of tongue twisting names and places, all designed to lend credibility to a pedestrian effort.Strikingly unoriginal, far too ambitious without preamble, this first book of The Price of Nothing definitely lives up to its title.Sorcery vs, religion and only the reader wins by putting the muddled thing down before incurring serious damage to the imagination."
2,"Overly Complex, Flat Characters","I'm usually very selective with what I read, so it is very rare for me to leave a book unfinished. Sadly, that was the case for The Darkness That Comes Before. This is clearly a very ambitious book, but the author over-emphasis in ultra-complex world-building at the cost of character development left completely uninterested in the story."
1,Love fantasy- but this is boring,"I love reading fantasy and sci-fi, but this just didn't cut it. I couldn't connect to the characters and I felt like the background information was not explained well. Really hard to get into, I kept falling asleep! I finally gave up around page 100. Good luck if you really want to read it!"
4,"Starts slow, but it is a very good book","The names in this book are gonna kill you,and the mapping is poor, but the book finishes strong and leaves you wanting more. I like his world and the factions that are fighting are very new. I think the folks that will not like this book are the ones who like an easy read"
2,Couldn't stay awake...,"Reads like a religious-psychology textbook. As a reader, I hate it when it takes you over 300 pages to get a grasp of characters, plots, locations, etc. For me, Bakker's writing is far too baroque - much too thick. I stopped halfway through, disappointed & totally not caring to learn more about any of the characters."
5,Finally a True Grey in a realm of Black and White Fantasy!,"This book will make you think -Very mature adult fantasy - the story is gripping, but a lot more interesting is the logic and thought process. Characters are well fleshed out and there is a lot of depth. Unusual story line - in the conventional sense, the main Protagonist's are not the cut and dry heroes, but more in shades of Grey rather than straightforward Black and White. There is no right or wrong - it is all in perspective.The inherent Philosophy in this book is a very different way of trying to reaching salvation (If I can take it so far). However to understand the surroundings and prevent it from affecting you or your goals is after-all the first step to self realization or awareness."
3,OK for the first 2 years but...,"Reasonable quality and good fit for my TJ, but not quite what I would expect from Bestop or for the price. After about 2 years the window frames started to leak. Bestop does not advise disassembly and and states that they are not repairable. Rain leaks in between the outer and inner window frames, not around the weatherstripping."
1,Returned for a refund,"The Sunpak 620-080 tripod fit inside this case okay. Unfortunately the strap is non-adjustable and has almost no clearance between it and the case, thereby making it impossible to carry on the shoulder. I found this to be a most undesirable feature and shipped it back for a refund. I do not recommend this product."
3,Sunpak 620 -760 Case,Case seems fine for the tripod. Rugged material looks like it will hold up well. Only problem is that the carrying strap is a little short. Makes it a little hard to carry over your shoulder.
4,Good fit,"I bought this to protect and store my Sunpak tripod and it does the job. The tripod fits in it perfectly and it cinches so I can fit it at the bottom of my backpack for easy carrying on hikes.I also bought one to fit my friend's tripod which happens to not be Sunpak but is the same length and it fits perfectly. She likes it a lot and it suits her needs.I would have preferred the bag be a bit wider and have 2 adjustment straps instead of one to make it easier and faster to pack the tripod. And if the carrying strap was adjustable so I can strap it across my shoulder, it would make carrying the tripod bag a lot easier."
3,bad handle on a good bag,"I just got my Sunpack tripod bag, and the bag itself seems fine, sturdy and lightweight, but the strap is a real disappointment. When the tripod is loaded into the bag, the strap is so tight you cannot sling it over your shoulder. It does work to grab it like a briefcase, although not well designed for that either. I wish the company would design it with an adjustable strap so that it could be carried on a hike easier."
4,The Sudoku Book: An Introduction to Sudoku with 101 Puzzles,"Good book, a nice assortment of puzzles of varying difficulty."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun",Very addictive and fun! Went through some puzzles while waiting in the airport and it absolutely made the time fly.
3,Sudoku disappointment,"I had great expectations. Those expectations were not met in that I already knew the basics and there was very little discussion on logic and none on advanced logic that must be used to solve the puzzles rated hard and very hard. The puzzles were fun, but would be easier to work if the pages were larger."
2,too small,"While the puzzles are good, the format of the book made it very awkward. Tho the size made it easy to slip in a pocket or purse, the binding was so stiff that it was very hard to work on the puzzles. I would have a hard time recommending this book to someone else."
3,Sudoku For Travelers,"Very convenient size for those of us who live on planes and trains. The 'tips' section does not go into much as detail as other puzzle books that discuss ""twins"", etc. Puzzles are ranked from easy to difficult. A nice first Sudoku book."
4,Review of The Sudoku Book,This is a good book for beginners as well as the more advanced. It offeres a how-to section in the beginning along with three levels of puzzles. The small size makes it easy to take with you and it is overall fun to do. I highly recommend this product to all customers.
3,Old-time humor in song,"For those of a certain age (probably 75+)this CD will bring back a lot of memories and produce some good chuckles. However those of a younger age will probably not be amused by the dated and very corny humor. I bought the CD for my 87 year old dad and he loved it, but I found the songs rather hard to listen to. They were somewhat repetitious and not particularly funny to me. Seeing my dad enjoying himself and talking about the songs definitely made the purchase worthwhile."
1,hmmm?,"i do a lot of cycling so bought this hoping it would help prevent sun exposure/damage. the active ingredient is pomegranate extract, and you take just one pill. i tried it, didnt see a difference, i have my doubts this has any proven effect..."
1,Are You Being Disappointed?,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Are You Being Served? I have most of the episodes memorized but this is a total rip off. The episodes shown here are available with the regular series DVDs and the quality is very poor. The ""On Set Interview"" lasts about 4 minutes and involves some reporter asking cast members if they like being on the show. DUH! Get the series, the movie and the sequel but forget this thing."
5,Great buy,These cables were a great buy and was fairly priced....works great and was easy to install....I would reccomend buying these to anyone who needs them
4,"Cables fine, slightly different length?, missing hardware","As the other reviewers have said, the length of the cables seems to vary slightly and hardware can be missing.1. Either the length varies slightly, or my tailgate is slightly warped. One of the original cables was probably stretching as it rusted through and broke. I replaced both cables and now when I put my weight on the tailgate, both cables take the strain, so I'm not worried.2. Some of the washers were missing. The way Dorman packages these (in a plastic sleeve with the end tucked in) allows the hardware to slip out during shipment. When these arrived, one cable was missing most of the washers. One washer was loose in the box, the others gone. Not a big problem--I reused the old washers.Appear to be as good as factory originals. Fit just fine.Nice that Amazon will ship these to Hawaii for free (super saver shipping)."
4,Strong advice; can be difficult to follow,"Change your life in a year? It would be great, no doubt. Cheryl Richardson expects the best from her readers, and anyone trying to follow these 52 lessons will find himself or herself breathless with exertion by the end. One week may simply not be enough to change deep-rooted personality traits. However, it's worth a shot, and if you do them in a different order, or miss a few, or don't finish, the changes you do implement successfully will more than merit the cost of the book and the time spent on self-improvement. Recommended."
4,Starting Over,"What I like about this is book is that Cheryl Richardson gives an outline to create the life we want. Of course, if your looking for someone to do the dirty work for you this might not be the book for you. But, if you are willing to be responsible for your life, this book can provide some effective tools you will need to create a great life. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold. Excellent."
3,not bad,"While she usually comes off great on Oprah, the author's writing style tends to be a little too syrupy at times. The books is short and nice, full of some good ideas, but tends to run towards religion and faith a lot (annoying to those of us who are not christian) and be a little too corny."
3,OK but really nothing new,"In a world full of self-help books, most of which may provide motivation but mostly state what is already obvious, I don't find that this much-ballyhooed book adds all that much. Sure, it has some good practical advice, but there is nothing in here that I haven't heard a million times before (be better organized, achieve a better balance, etc etc). Read The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and then forget about this genre until someone comes along with something truly enlightening, which this author has not."
1,Master of the Obvious,"I was highly anticipating reading this book due to the reviews and interviews with the author on various tv shows. However, I found the advice trite and obvious. Doesn't everybody know that cleaning their office will make their work more efficient? Isn't it obvious that I should spend a balance of time between work, self and family? Such advice is insulting to an intelligent person and spirtually I found the book extremely hollow."
1,Nothing new,There is nothing new in this book and most of the exercises were shallow and not likely to have any great impact on lives - certainly could have made better use of my money.I also didn't like the over-emphasis on the need to have lots and lots of friends to support you through the exercises - a nice way to make some of us who don't have wads of friends or are more self sufficient feel totally inadequate.
5,Step by step - just what I need!,Definitely on my recommended book list. A must read for women in business.Susan BockThe Success Coach for Women in Businesswww.SusanBockSolutions.com
3,"Completely flat surface, no draining of water back into sink","As stated, the surface of this is completely flat, so you have standing water when you are done using the sink. It is very attractive, but the company who ships this for Amazon does NOT know how to package. The first one we ordered was broken in two places (no padding whatsoever, only cardboard box). The second one had even less packaging, had a small chip on the back corner and we decided to live with it."
2,For Wodehouse completists only,"While pleasant enough, this book lacks the careful plotting and pointed characterization on which Sir Pelham worked so hard in his later books.The coincidences are there, not because they're funny, but to save the author a small amount of work. I confess that I had to keep jumping back in the book to keep the various characters straight, and I never did discern much, if any, plot. Wodehouse poked fun at plotless, coincidence-driven novels in his later books; perhaps he was trying to atone for his first one."
4,liked it ---uneven writing and story lines,"The first 2 seasons are interesting and pretty good, although towards the end the motivations come on rather quickly and stilted. The last season, 6 had a lot of promise.... it could have been a great series, but the motivations of some of the characters and story lines sometimes, seemed like a middle school girl wrote it. I enjoyed it and watched all of it; but it could have been better and more polished and thoughful."
4,No nonsense nonsense,"I don't repeat the plots. This is a comedy with some romantic inclination. If you like bad jokes, a somewhat dirty sense of humor, and silly situations this is for you. If you liked Bobobo Bo-bobobo you might like this, but it may be a little less silly. Not by a lot. It is one definitely worth picking up if you like the comedy genre of anime films. There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek references to older anime and popular Japanese culture, so reading the Liner's notes in the included booklets is a good idea. There are also some art and other notes you may or may not find interesting, as well as a short Manga. With little fighting and no real bad-guys this is a series driven by characters and the situations they get into (or create). Sometimes the screen is ""busy"" with translations of what's on the screen in Japanese, it's usually worth pausing to read what they say. Some are informative, many are amusing. Overall I liked this series quite a lot."
2,"cute but, it seems like it needs more to it.",i love vtech toys and have stood by them as a main product for my son... to me it seems like this toy is needed just a little more to it. maybe more songs sound and buttons...
1,Only if you're tone deaf,"If you have any ear for music, run away from this toy. The recording of robotic-sounding children sing in a completely different key than the accompanying music. It is like fingernails on a blackboard. And the language is very stilted, as if it was electronically translated from another language. Just horrible. Horrible and inane."
2,Off-key,"It's hard to get past the fact that the singing audio is REALLY flat as compared to the background audio. It's extremely annoying. Unless you're tonedeaf, then this toy will drive you crazy. Despite the good qualities, this is something I can't get past."
4,good movie,"It was a good movie, but not as good as Angels in the Outfield. I do not care for baseball but I loved Angels in the Outfield."
1,Terrible movie!,"I can't believe there are so many reviewers who said this movie was good. It really isn't good...in fact, it's horrible, and isn't worth your time. The acting is slow and so bad you'll wretch, and the plot is entirely predictable. The most spectacular waste of 90 minutes of my life next to any Lifetime movie."
5,Thanks for getting me organized.,"The system you wrote is fantastic. I have been rifeing through drawers, boxes, and paper for years. I really didn't think there was a way. But there is. Thank you very much, Mary Martin. I really didn't think it was possible."
3,"Nothin' runs like a Deere, but....","My 2 year old son LOVES his tractor and it goes everywhere with us. However, the ""cab"" of the tractor is where the batteries go and that piece completely comes off all the time. He drops it and it comes off, he pulls too hard, it comes off, he looks at it cross-eyed...well, you get the idea. The sounds and lights are great. Not too loud like other toys. He has a blast, I just wish Mommy didn't have to snap it back together all the time. Maybe it is just mine, but thought I would post just in case it is a serious design flaw."
1,These are just to look at.,"These arrived very fast, but when I took it out of its box the handle fell off of one of them, no way it could hold salt or pepper,there cute to look at, but not functional."
5,Love Them,I have had tin shakers for years but they finally wore out. I was thrilled to find these on Amazon. I bought two sets because we are snowbirds and I wanted a set in both homes. The lids fit snug and the handles are tight. I love them!! I wish they had more choices of design or color but I was thrilled to find these!
2,So dissappointed,"I love the size, the amount of salt and pepper thatshakes out, how they look, so cute! I knew right away though, that the saltshaker handle was loose, so we did not hold it by the handle, or the pepper.Today, the handle fell off the salt shaker. I thought maybe it would still workbut would not be as cute. The salt pours out the holes from the handle. Had to tapeit until I can find a new set. Very dissappointed because I really liked them."
2,Salt n Pepper Shaker,"I thought I would like them, but the holes are too big for cooking when shaking the item out. I will keep them for picnics or parties in the summertime."
1,Disappointed,"The handle broke off the Salt with the second refill. I love the design as it matches my decor, however the quality is pretty shoddy."
1,"So cute, yet so disappointing","So cute coming out of the box. When I filled them with salt and pepper for use though the handle of the salt came unriveted. They're just kind of stuck into the side of the barrel. Of course, salt comes out of the hole and goes everywhere before I know what's happening and can get it to stop. They're so going back..."
3,Neat Shakers,"I bought these as I had just broken my last cheap glass salt shaker and for the price could not pass it up. The shakers looked like the picture and I cleaned them up and loaded them right away. The one warning I would give on the salt shaker is that the holes are big and you could pour out more salt then you want. I would make sure you try it over something before you put on your food. I can see that the product will be dented easily and could have been made from a thicker metal.Overall: Decent product, cheap price, fast shipping, big holes in the salt shaker, made from mediocre materials"
3,weak rivets,"I think they look nice, but the rivets on the handles are horrible. They are so weak and one of the holes was way off to the side of the handle instead of being centered. With hardly any force the handles ripped off. I replaced the rivets with better ones and now it seems very secure.If they used better rivets it would be a much better product."
1,"Crappy product, cheaply made","I bought these since they look so cute, but once I received them, I was not impressed with the quality. The salt shaker is not practical due to the many holes. Also, the handle popped off and will not go back on! Do not buy!"
2,"They're Cute, but...","Not what I was expecting.The shakers are cute.However, made very cheaply.Product also took longer to arrive, then specified.Would not purchase from this company, again!"
4,Love this little pair.,"Searched high and low for replacement shakers. Found this pair on Amazon, checked out the seller's web site and am very happy with my purchase. They are a great size and the pepper shaker actually has enough holes for the pepper to come through. My hubby is a pepper freak and he is very content with this product. They also are really cute and I have had several compliments on the pair. Classic is what they are."
1,Dont purchase,"I thought these looked so cute, but taking them out of the package, they are nothing like the picture. Me and my husband each picked up a shaker and at the same time both of our handles broke, they are soooo poorly made, that I am returning them. I dont suggest you buy them because even though they are only $5 they are not even worth having."
5,Love them,I received these yesterday and I love them. Very well made and good for either usuing them or for decor.
3,Believe supplier tried hard,"I had been looking at these salt and pepper shakers for a while - at a higher price. I ordered them from this supplier at a lower price. As it turns out, it was good that I didn't pay very much for them. They were smaller and had a different finish than I had expected. The supplier was very prompt in sending the item and they packed it very well. However, the top rivet on the salt shaker was broken. Because I bought them for a reasonable price, I did not return them. I believe the supplier did their best to get them to me in the state they were represented. I would order products from them again - just not this product."
1,Other glove was much better,"Finally wore out my microplane glove and decided to give this one a try. I absolutely hate it. The material feels almost sticky, which makes it a real pain to put on. Since I always use it when preparing food (cheese graters and mandolins have it out for me!) I wash it after each use. The microplane glove held up use after use, wash after wash. Maybe washing this one is what made it ""sticky"", I'm not sure. But if I'm using it for food prep I need to wash it! Going back to my microplane."
5,Great Machine,"I had another brand of machine that I bought less than 5 years ago and never wanted to take it out because I disliked using it. The Brother machine is an amazing machine, especially for it's price. I don't sew a lot--some alterations and doll clothes. It's easy to use and exactly what I need. I love it!"
5,Great beginner machine,This was a wonderful beginner machine. I have just done some basic sewing but it works great! The tension is a bit touchy but easy to fix and keep going. Would highly recommend for the price.
5,Super Awesome,"I bought this sewing machine just so I could sew up my Halloween Costumes. I'm a real Halloween nut, so I go all out every year. This year, I decided to make my own costumes... Only problem was, I didn't have a sewing machine. So, I found this one. It's cheap. It's practical. This machine is very basic, and very easy to use. I absolutely fell in love with it after the first usage, truthfully, I use it on a daily basis now. Great product! Definitely deserves the five stars!"
1,Don't buy a Brother!,"Within 1 month, the bobbin case got nicked and the thread started snagging. A new bobbin case is $60! That's over half the price of the whole machine!!! Do not buy a brother! This is totally unaccepable."
4,Seems good,Has not been used yet. Dont have space in our apartment to set up. We will see if it gets used in the next one.
4,"Brother xl-2600i, insuperable en su precio.","de verdad estoy contento con la adquisición, ya que da mucho mas de lo que vale, todas sus funciones elegible funcionan bien, y el manejo para el principiante es aceptable mientras tenga por lo menos un apoyo visual con un vídeo de youtobe, mi calificación de cuatro puntos es por la utilización de muchas piezas plásticas donde a mi percepción necesitaría piezas de metal, esto lo hace menos resistente pero mucho mas liviano. A! y ojo con el embobinado de los carretes ya que tiene que tener la tensión adecuada y lo consigues haciendo exactamente lo que te dice el manual..."
2,Sticker came off,"We purchased this sewing machine for our daughter for Christmas. It arrived promptly and was well-packaged. However, when she removed the cardboard protecting the dial the packing tape started to tear the sticker off the dial. She was very careful about removing the tape as soon as she noticed the problem. Tape removed another portion of sticker elsewhere on the machine. We contacted the seller and they immediately sent us a second machine, which we have not yet received. But we are concerned that we will have the same problem. Has anyone else noticed this? The damage to the sticker makes it difficult to read the settings and will eventually cause the entire sticker to wear away."
3,hard to figure out the different stitches,"Good price, does the job, but hard to figure out the different stitches and how to use them. Instruction booklet needs to be a little more detailed when it comes to choosing different usage of stitches."
4,Good machine for the money,"My wife had been struggling with an old clunker and I got tired of watching her fighting the machine more than she was sewing. She also doesn't like all the gadgets on those computerized models so I went with this and I'm glad I did.It's NOT for sewing through heavy material and even though it does do some neat stitches I found she doesn't need them, she does basic sewing.She still gets frustrated but not nearly as much and the machine is much quieter, lighter, and easier to use than her old one. Now she can actually sew more than fight a machine which is why I purchased it."
5,Amazing,I was amazed by all the things this little machine offered. I have now sewn my first quilt with this machine. I absolutely love it. I used it for heavy use and no complaints or problems. I broke one needle (but it was my fault) but there were 4 backup needles included so it barely slowed me down. It handled layers with ease and all sorts of fabric. I'm a first time sewing machine user but I recommend it for any level.
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!","Received this sewing machine for Christmas, and although I have very limited sewing skills and have only ever used one other sewing machine, I have had ZERO problems using this sewing machine. I've already made several things, including a quiet book for my son, and a nursing cover which only cost me $4 to make (instead of $35 to buy). It's nice for people like me that can never remember how to thread the thing, because it has numbers on it, so you don't skip a step. Also, it has a needle threader, which is SO NICE!! Worth the money, perfect for beginners who plan on keeping it for a long time, or as a smaller back up machine for more experienced users."
3,Gathering and Manual,"I'm a beginner at sewing but my mom is not. She has started using this machine recently and even she has a bit of a hard time with it.The manual doesn't really help, it even harder to figure out what to do when I can't decipher what the heck the manual is saying.Also, we had to go through a bit of fabric to figure out how to get the stiches big enough to gather fabric.All in all its an easy machine to use, I just with the manual was a little bit more user friendly and not full of jargon."
4,sewing machine,"I bought this sewing machine for my wife ,not knowing much about sewing and much less about the machines. My wife loves it, very easy to use,and works very well. The best thing now is all my family clothing is fixed that needed to be fixed. I'd recommend this to anyone who needs a machine that's user friendly, and works very well. A great beginner/intermediate machine, and great value."
4,Good Sewing Machine,My wife uses it and she likes it. She had a problem of tension as some people mention but somehow she fixed it and now working beautifully.
5,Brother Sewing Machine - great buy,"I like the machine, it is easy to use and light to carry. Great for a person who only needs to do minor mending and sewing. It might do more, but I am a beginner sewer. The only thing I do not like is the manual; each paragraph and some sentences are co-mingled in both English and Spanish so it is difficult to read."
4,<3 !,"I got a refurbished model and I really like it. I use it mostly for quilting and it works really well. The throat is a little small, but I was able to free-motion-quilt a queen-sized quilt without any problem. It's easy to use, sturdy (my toddler pulled it onto the linoleum floor from the table and while the thread holder bent a little, it still works just fine), and really light-weight.I do tend to have a little bit of tension issue, especially when free-motion-quilting with the quilting foot. I also wish that I was able to lower the feed dogs instead of just putting the darning plate over them.I absolutely recommend this for someone who wants a light-weight, versatile machine."
3,Cant sew my jeans,I bought this for my wife and she was so excited to use this to do basic alterations and projects but it works a bit too hard to get through denim pant cuffs. I had to take my jeans in to be professionally altered because we were afraid to break the machine. I like that the machine didn't break the bank but I feel that should be able to expect a bit more from this machine!
4,Good machine,"I've tried several of the stitches and all has worked well. The unit does not handle heavy fabrics well so denim and such will not be an option.For the money, this is a great buy. The perfect machine to ease back into my long lost hobby."
5,Great deal,"I bought this for my nine yr. old granddaughter. It was a great deal for the economical price. The instructions were easy to follow and the threading and drop-in bobbin system were easy enough for my granddaughter to accomplish on her own. As she becomes more comfortable with the basics of the machine, she can go on to more complicated stitches and sewing projects. Good investment!"
2,Only for beginners! Not durable,"First of all you should know that it's low end machine (mainly sold by discount retailers) from the famous Brother company.The machine has 25 stitch functions and easy to use, but it's plastic moving parts and frame.So it's not durable. My machine broken 2 times during 5 months (both times it was fixed by warranty).After this I bought good quality middle-end sewing machine from Brothers for $500.Probably it's ok to buy this machine for girl as first sewing machine,but it's not durable enough for often use."
1,Broke after ONE MONTH,"I've only had this machine for a month. ONE month. And in the middle of a project, the lower thread started to tangle. I've replaced the bobbin, made sure it caught on the spring, etc., etc. I've read the manual, opened up the plates. Nothing. This is not worth the time or the stress. I'm changing brands."
4,Upper Thread Looping,"Great basic machine. I was looking for a replacement for a 60 year-old console, just to do the basics - alterations, repairs and simple projects - and this machine works well for me.Looping... After a few trial runs, I had a problem with upper thread looping on the underside of the fabric. It took some time to find the problem: There is a small spring inside the metal thread guide on the top of the machine (threading step 1). I had more than once missed the spring when threading. Once I discovered my mistake and made certain that the thread engaged the spring, I had no more problems."
2,Horrible machine,"I gave this machine 2 stars only because it is very easy to set up, threading the bobbin and needle are a piece of cake with the directions. Other than that, it does not run well. It is impossible to start out slowly- the instructions say to vary the pressure on the peddle to control the speed, but it is either off or running at 100 mph, which is extremely frustrating. The second issue, which pushed me over the edge and made me return the machine, is the thread from the bobbin periodically doesn't engage in the seam. I would be sewing along just fine (although too quickly), and it would suddenly skip out, then kick back in, ruining the seam and I'd have to start all over. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,"Good Machine, Great Price","I bought this for my wife who has little experience sewing, but is getting into it with quilts and other baby stuff. She started out using a borrowed Brother XL5500 which she liked and got familiar with. She was really excited about her new Brother XL2600i. The hardest part was figuring out how to pull up the bottom thread from the bobbin. We looked and tried everything, but couldn't figure it out. Then we found a video on YouTube that showed exactly how to do it. Apparently we weren't the only ones who were confused. Overall the machine was a great price and does everything my wife wants. She is having fun and said this machine is perfect for what she does."
3,"could be better, goes too fast for a beginner","Granted, I'm comparing this with my primary machine which is the Brother CS-6000i and that's about twice the price, but I was disappointed in this product. We bought it for our 9 year old for Christmas as a machine for her to learn to sew on. Two primary complaints.1. There's no speed adjustment, and since this is often purchased for beginners as noted on many reviews, this is a HUGE issue. It goes WAY too Fast for a new sewer that's just learning to control the speed. Mine has 3 speeds and the slow speed is perfect for her. In fact, this is such a disappointment, I would have returned it if it were easier to fit back into the box.2. The bobbin receptacle is fritzy and likes to get tangled. Could be user error, but mine is FAR superior. I've been using that one for 2 years and never had a problem.All in all, I'd highly recommend spending another $40 or so to get adjustable speeds if you're learning."
4,Definitely would recommend for a newbie.,"This is my first sewing machine. I was interested in learning mainly to save money on things like curtains and pillow covers. This machine is easy to use and has great features. The only problem was when my lower thread would attach to the material correctly, and no matter what I did, I couldn't fix the problem...until I read another reviewer's comment about how to fix it!http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QCLHU31S9527/ref=cm_cd_pg_oldest?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx1P4PIKS19I1QW&cdPage;=1&asin;=B000F7DPEQ&store;=arts-crafts&cdSort;=newest&cdThread;=Tx1N7RE6ZCXXMTX#wasThisHelpfulSo if you read that review, and you know how to avoid that one problem, then this machine will work great for you. I think sewing will be a lot more fun for me now that I know how to fix that one hiccup. :)"
4,Notes from an 8 year old,It's easy to use except the bobbin is hard to wind. I've sewed practice stitches and made 3 pillows already. And I really like it.
2,not very good,"I've bought this because of good reviews. But when it came, it looked cheap, and the thread on the bottom bobbin didn't regulate so the thread was going all sorts of crazy. I'm very dissapointed."
5,Sew WHAT?,"Being a rather simple person, I wanted an inexpensive sewing machine to do very simple things. Just the basics. I have not yet had the chance to experiment much with this ... but it comes with many more bells and whistles than I had even anticipated. A great machine for novices -- with simple to understand instructions."
4,good machine but threading is hard,I got this sewing machine as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is a complete beginner and wanted to make some pillows and things. She likes it and has used it 4 or 5 sessions and says the thing she doesn't like about it is that following the poorly written directions that came with it didn't make threading easy. I actually brought up a video online that thankfully had a similar machine that showed how to thread it. Other than that it has done everything she wants it to do.
1,Broke after only 2 uses,"I purchased this sewing machine for my daughter as a gift for christmas 2011. Ordered the machine on December 4th, gave as a gift on December 25th, 2011. It is now February 29th, 2012 and my daughter is using it for only the second time and it will not bring the stitch up from the bottom bobbin. Checked with Amazon to return and the return window has expired (Jan. 31, 2012). So now I am stuck with a worthless machine and no place to go. I have always enjoyed Amazon and am quite surprized that I can not return this for a new one.Brother XL2600I Sew Advance Sew Affordable 25-Stitch Free-Arm Sewing Machine"
4,My new Brother sewing machine.,"This machine was great in that I was actually sewing within minutes. I plan to do mostly dressmaker sewing which I do just for myself. After using the machine I realized it would never be adequate for much decorator sewing which I enjoy also. It lacks the power for sewing through thicker fabrics. I sewed 2 Vikings into oblivion. Their much vaunted ""lifetime guarantee"" is meaningless if they can't provide parts for old machines, thus my interest in a cheaper machine. For what the Brother is designed for it is an excellent value."
4,Brother sewing machine,I have had this machine for a few weeks now and I enjoy it. I find it easy to use though I have only used a few of its features. I am new to sewing and just do simple things but threading and filling the bobbin were easy and the instructions helpful.
2,Be Careful With This Sewing Machine,"This machine is BRAND NEW but even with the manual, I cannot find out why the sewing machine will sew part of the button hole and not the rest of it! I have been sewing with Singers for over 30 years--was excited about the one-step buttonhole feature on this. I can't find a help number, called a local sewing machine repair shop only to be told that they don't help with machines they don't sell. Be careful buying a machine online!!! Just not impressed with the level of service after the sale on this item."
2,sewing machine,Poor quality product. The machine began to make noises and would not work after being used twice. Returned product for refund.
5,Love it,"Purchased this about two months ago and wanted to use it before I reviewed it. It's a great machine for the cost. I am new to sewing and I have been so happy with it. I already made two items of clothing and one tote bag. I intend to use it a lot more! I highly recommend it.UPDATE:I still love my Brother sewing machine. I have since made a few dresses, about 5 or 6 skirts, a couple of tops, and a tailor's ham. I've sewn with knits too. I am very happy with it. I do like the quality of stitching and I think it threads easily. I thought the manual was simple to follow. I speak english and spanish but I read english 100% better than spanish so I just ignore the spanish part of the manual. I keep the manual by my side and I refer to it frequently when I need help with something. I would highly recommend it. If you're interested in seeing some of the stuff I've made, please email me. Let me know if you have any questions."
4,thread pops out of needle - any tips?,"this is my first machine and i am really enjoying it. my main complaint is that the thread often comes out of the needle, sometimes in the middle of sewing. is anyone else having this problem? any tips? i thought maybe it was a tension issue but i don't really know how to deal with it. also, when i get to the end of the fabric that i'm sewing, the machine likes to curve, so i have to be extra careful to hold it straight. but other than that, enjoying the machine, and it's a great deal."
5,Love It!,"I accidentally broke my other new sewing machine by dropping it and ordered this new Brother as my backup to finish sewing my curtains. I thought my other machine worked well, but now that I have the Brother XL2600I, I'm happy about having to replace the old one. This thing is great!"
5,the best machine,"This is the best machine. The machine is easy to use, and strong. You guys will like.Brother XL2600I Sew Advance Sew Affordable 25-Stitch Free-Arm Sewing Machine (Purchased on June 11, 2012)Brother XL2600I Sew Advance Sew Affordable 25-Stitch Free-Arm Sewing Machine"
4,Good value,"Purchased for a beginner sewer and myself for travel, the machine is lightweight and easy to use. Not as quiet as my ""big"" machine, but has all the basics. It was a very good buy!"
3,Average,"I went from a Singer to a Brother and the quality isn't as good, however, it does a good job for what I use it for. It is a little complicated to figure out certain things but it works fine. Hopefully it will last. The singer I had lasted years!"
5,What a nice sewing machine!,"The quick-start guide is great! You can literally start sewing right away because the tension is set just right. The accessories that come with the machine are great. Be sure to read your manual and change the foot according to what type of sewing you'll be doing. The blind hem-stitch attachment is wonderful! Never again will you have to struggle hemming a pair of pants. The feed dogs are amazing. You get a perfect straight stitch every time. I did hire a lady to give me sewing lessons and she showed me how to use the accessories; however, you'd be fine just reading the instruction booklet."
4,short spindle solution,I have the less expensive model but it also has a short spindle for the spool of thread. Solved the problem with a drinking straw. Cut it just taller than the large spool of thread and put over the short spindle- voila problem solved.
1,"ok machine, instruction manual terrible","The machine is just ok, but the instructionmanual is terrible. I am college educated withexcellent comprehension ability but theinstruction manual for this machine(especially for a complete novice),is difficult and hard to follow.I wouldn't recommend this model to a friend."
3,havnt used yet,"We have not used the machine yet, so I have no idea how it is going to work. The shipment was very fast, we bought it with a prime account. The reason I am rating it with 3 stars is that the knob came with scratches."
1,troublesome,"problems with it from day one with tension, needle, material catchingin mechanism. I am ready to throw the darn thing out."
2,Not heavy duty enough,"I got what I paid for, it wasn't heavy duty enough for what I needed to do with it. Cheap"
5,I have bought 2 of these machines!,I bought the first Brother XL600I for my oldest daughter for Christmas a year and a half ago. She loves it! She has made many garments with the machine and it runs like a charm. She took it to college with her last year and used it in her dorm room. I bought the second machine in May for my daughter who just graduated from high school. She wanted one to take to college also. She has used her sister's and knew it was a good one. My 2 youngest daughter already have their eye on having there own machine. I will buy them the same model if it is still available at that time!
5,Amazing little machine!,"I wasn't sure about this purchase, having never used a sewing machine before. But now I'm a convert for sure! Once I figured out how to thread it, which really wasn't that hard, it's worked just fine for me, and I am a novice ""seamster"", if that's the correct word. I've used it for a number of projects, and in the few short weeks I've owned it, it has paid for itself. Impressively it worked just fine on a rather thick fabric, duck cloth, as well as regular thickness material. I love the needle threading mechanism, amazingly easy and perfect for those of us with less than perfect close vision."
4,Sewing Novice,"This seems to be good value for money so far, although all I have used the machine for so far is for mending and sewing a few simple curtain panels. I like all the accessories that came with it, but have not had a chance to use them all to comment on how they are. The needle threader is a great addition. Like another reviewer noted, I was accustomed to the presser foot lever being at the back, rather than the inside. I too have had some problems with the bottom thread looping, but I will try what another reviewer suggested about making sure it's seated properly in the spring and see how that works. My aim is to take a sewing course soon, so I can then give a better evaluation on my purchase :)"
4,Great for Beginner's!,"I got this machine as a ""beginner"" machine and Love it. My bobbin thread kept getting tangled until my husband stepped in a put the bobbin in the opposite way the diagram and instructions show and it's not gotten tangled since. Not great for thicker fabrics, but that was expected. Otherwise, really enjoy my machine."
1,Tension terrible,"I am returning the machine after three days of use. There is no way to adjust the lower thread tension, and it is too loose to make the machine usable. I am sewing on basic cotton scraps, but the tension is so loose, even after repeated adjustments, that the seams will not hold. Very disappointed."
2,Cannot hem jeans or other heavy fabric,"I should have paid more attention to the person who said it simply could not handle heavier material like denim. I bought it and, sure enough, it simply cannot handle the seams on simple hemming if the fabric is anything more than lightweight. It skips 10+ stitches after and sometimes before the seam as well. It has to be hand-turned and crammed through (gently) just to get any heavier fabric to pass under the pressure foot, as its highest point is still too low. Even with all that, it skips stitches and sometimes produced a mess-ball of thread underneath. The other reviewer was exactly right; this one is useful for other lightweight sewing, but you need ANOTHER machine to do jeans, etc. I don't have another one, so I am hoping Brother will take this one back. The man at the Brother authorized repair place told me to send it back and get something else; it would never work for my needs. Sadly, it does everything else very well and has nice features."
5,Perfect sewing machine,"This is the first sewing machine I ever used, and OMG it is perfect! I never used a sewing machine prior to this one (I used to sew by hand) and it works so well. I was surprised how smooth this machine worked. It is so easy to use and easy to set up. I have a hard time understanding written instructions, but these instructions were so simple for me to read. To set up the machine, they give you a picture of how to do it (which shows you step by step) and of course the written directions. I know alot of the reviews said that the instruction booklet is hard to read, but...it REALLY is not!Anyway, I LOVE this sewing machine and it is so great to use."
4,Good sewing machine,I got this as a gift for my mother she loves it. The only bad thing the thread gets stuck every now and then but other then that it works great she makes stuff for her grandkids all the time.
5,"I don't sew very much, but when I do I like it simple",So far I have been very pleased. I do do some mending and alterations and I made a bunch of quilted purses for Christmas gifts. It has worked very well on everything and I couldn't be more happy with my purchase.
4,Brother xl2600i meets all my expectations,"I was looking for a lightweight machine to take with me to quilting classes. I didn't need anything fancy and the price was right. It too me a little while to figure out the dials (my other machine is computerized), It is a good basic machine and I am pleased with my purchase."
4,Brother XL2600i Sewing Machine,My wife is satisfied with this machine and I'm sure will get years of use from it. The instruction manual is also very easy to understand.
4,first buying on amazon,"this is very good item and for amazon service, i am totally satisfied.but i faced a problem that as in USA they use 110 AC power supply but here in middle east we use 220 AC power supply so i have bought a supply changer to use this item.2ndly the warranty is only use in USA it is not applicable to any other Brother store in any other country. so there is no use of 25years warranty card that i have received with item."
3,"Sews fast, but jams occasionally","I've been learning how to sew, and I thought a beginner machine would be perfect; if sewing didn't pan out for me, then little love lost, right? However, I have taken to the hobby. Unfortunately, the sewing machine has not taken to me. A machine that jams is like a rifle that misfires: is it any wonder I hesitate to charge in?This doesn't appear to be a personal problem; even experienced seamstresses occasionally jammed, and struggled to untangle the thread underneath. My hypothesis is that this is an analogy machine (indicated by the stitch-selection knobs) and not a digital one. Digital machines, in any industry, tend to are the way to go."
3,Has special needs,"The tension does bunch, but if you sew for a couple of inches then go back a few stitches and then continue sewing, that resolves it (I find). I bought it because the biggest complaint from others was that the needle threader did not work. Mine works, but it is nothing like the diagram in the instructions. You just kind of have to figure it out. I cannot explain it and here there is no way to draw a diagram.Another thing is, you have to carefully wind bobbins according to instructions. When a bobbin is more than half empty, this seems to jam the machine as well. Loading a freshly wound bobbin seems to prevent jams and bunching.Cheap thread shreds and breaks and may cause other problems. Use high quality thread and read the instructions very carefully. Will update when I have done more sewing."
1,bad choice,"I have had nothing but trouble with this machine since I purchased it. Due to a serious illness in the family, I was not able to try it when it was delivered. When I did start a project, the fabric would not feed and even seemed to go backwards. I wrote to Brother and they said to take it to the nearest Brother dealer. The closest dealer was over an hour away, but I took the machine there and the first thing that they said was that this was not really a Brother sewing machine. They finally agreed to have someone check out the machine and when I picked it up they said that it had a defective part from the factory. I have used it for about 6 hours since then and in the midst of a project, it's doing the same thing again. I do not recommend this model."
5,An excellent buy,This is a GREAT machine for the money - it does everything the average sewer needs and does it well. I bought it because my $700 Elna became too heavy for me - this one is amazingly light. I really like the easy access to backstitching and with a little practice the needle threader works very well. I highly recommend this machine
5,Great Machine For The Price!,"This is a great little machine for anyone that sews a lot or just now and then, I'm a professional crafter and sew almost every day. I use a wide variety of fabrics from wool felt,cottons to plush firs and this machine works well with all fabrics. I love the simplicity of this machine as well, If you don't need all the bells and Whistles this is a good machine. And with the free shipping, cant beat that!"
1,Jamming Thread Problems,I bought this sewing machine and have had problems with it jamming over and over again. Bringing it back and trying again.
5,Sewing,Just what I needed. Not complicated at all. Don't sew much but great to have around when needed.
4,"good, but FAST!","I bought this as a beginner's machine, and so far it has worked great. Threading the machine is super easy and the bobbin just drops in. My only problem is that it goes too fast! It has a pedal, but if you try to press lightly it only makes a noise like it's revving up, then away it goes! Once it starts up you can slow it down, but there's no initial ease into the stitch. I bought a magnetic seam guide which helped greatly with keeping the stitches straight. It doesn't come with a case, though, so you have to buy one separately. Definitely worth the price and delivered very quickly, but I will probably upgrade once my skills improve."
4,Good value,"I am not a heavy user but still need it for a few day to day fixesFor the price we paid and feature we got , it definately worth it"
3,Brother's Sewing machine,"I was a bit disappointed not with the product, but with the way it was shipped. This was a christmas present for my daughter and when it arrived on our doorstep in the factory box, it took away the surprise element for christmas. The sewing machine itself is great."
1,This machine is terrible!,"This machine is a terrible machine! This was my first sewing machine and the tension was terrible. It doesn't sew very good what so ever. When I finish sewing something I can rip the seems very easily. It doesn't work good with fleece either. I had many amazing sewers try to fix it. They couldn't fix it. I returned it and got another one in case it was just a bad machine, but no this one was even worse.Once again this is a beyond terrible machine!"
1,A total POS,"I have spent 3 GOD DAM HOURS TRYING TO GET THIS THING TO WORK. the bottom thread won't loop, it keeps getting jammes. all i want to do is cuff some of my damn jeans and i can't even do that. I have yelled into my scream-box atleast 12 times because of this pos.This is def the worst purchase i've ever made on amazon. I will never buy another brother product as long as i live."
4,Brother leads the field in easy sewing,"The drop in bobbin and easy threading, idiot proof sewing - with a readable instruction book makes this machine a blessing. It does more than the average repair person needs..perhaps spuring you to more advanced projects."
5,good price and function for a beginner,"good price and enough function for a beginner, I used to buy expensive one, when it was broken, the repair fee cost me much more than this new one. And it only lasted one month and broke again. Buy this one is a good choice!"
5,Happy with my choice of machine,"Just used my machine for the first time today. I read over the instructions as well as a book I brought at my fabric store before attempting anything. I've been terrified of using a sewing machines so I was so relieved that this machine is fairly quiet and easy to understand. I did 4 practice stitches, had to put my tension on 7 and it looked great. Made my daughter a barbie blanket in about 10 minutes :)I highly recommend searching for online videos of this machine, there are 3 on YouTube that were so great and really helped me. I'm happy with this machine and pretty proud of myself for overcoming my fear."
5,Perfect for beginner,"this machine does everything i could hope for. tip... i saved the box and use that to store the machine. lightweight, but sturdy. best value around!"
3,All plastic.....not like the older models,The machine seems to work ok but there is not a piece of metal on it. Even the slide plate is plastic. I will keep it but think I will have my older machine repaired just in case. They just don't make them like they used to.
4,good product,"I needed a sewing machine to do mostly small progects.I've owned 3 Singers.first one was grandmas with foot pedal for mending.Brother is a good machine if you take the time to read the handbook,use the correct needle for material and make the right adjustments when needed.I've got to find out if Brother makes a ruffler.Had one with Singer and it was great .It is simple to operate and good for average to above seamstress!"
2,The thought was there....,I like this machine and all its functions but the thread was always getting snagged. Also the instructions do not explain that when threading the thread there is a location (the long slit on the picture running from the top to the bottom) where the thread has to be hooked onto a very small unnoticable hook. If you don't mind stopping and fixing these problems every couple of minutes than your fine.
4,Christmas for Grand daughter,Received in a timely manner. It was well appreciated by the grand daughter who received it. She was able to make several gift projects for Christmas.
5,Wonderful product!!!,This is by far one of the best sewing machines I've ever used! (over 20 years) it's simple to learn to operate and does a wonderful job with sewing multiple stitch patterns! I would recommend this machine above any other!
5,great simple machine,"after fighting the thread in my old used machine this one is great !! I have had no bobbin problems others have mentioned, and no problems sewing multiple layers of material, easy to move, quick to set up, if you are thinking if getting a new machine and only need a few basic stitches this machine fits the bill."
5,This machine surprised me.,"I thought I was buying a machine that would ""get me by"" until I could get a ""good"" machine. Wrong. It works very well and I'm really happy with it. I've now sewn 30 items on it and it's been a breeze."
1,Never could get it to work---and I tried with 2 different machines!,"As the title says, I could never get this to work. Called Brother tech support and was told to simply return it. After repeating the experience with another identical machine, I had the same result.YMMV, though. If you do buy it, BE SURE to use ONLY the bobbins that came with the machine. Other bobbins look the same, but trust me---they're not!"
1,Do not recommend,I purchased this product for basic sewing but have been very unhappy. It seems to have trouble even with a straight stitch. The bobbin mechanism is poor -- it continually jams and I spend more time fighting with it than actually sewing. I will probably have to replace this machine if I want to continue sewing and I have only been using it for a couple of months.
2,nice at first,"i have only used my sewing machine 10 times or so, then the belt started slipping and now has to be repaired costing as much as i paid for the darn thing. not such a deal at all.."
5,Captured songs,"As life on the land sinks into the western sunset, these lonely songs sung by rural women may be all that's left."
3,Good primer,"This book is a good primer, however it is not as indepth as I thought. I thought this would be a detailed A-Z. Dont get me wrong, it is worth having! Buy one used it would be worth the price."
5,Great for Phonics Activities,This is a great book to use with young children in helping them to learn phonics. There are many activity sheets that are helpful in teaching the various phonics skills to young children. A must have for any teacher who is teaching phonics in the lower grades.
2,Artemis Woman Heel Smoother - HS1000,I purchased this product for my wife as a X-Mas present and she was very disappointed in the results achieved.
5,Definately worth the money because it saves me money!,"Being a college student, I can't afford to get a pedicure as often as I would like. My sister recently brought home a new Heel Smoother and I just love it. In fact, I just love giving myself a pedicure at home. It easily gets rid of my dry skin on the bottom of my totally abused feet as I don't wear sock during the winter (crazy, I know). I'm so glad I found this product before the summer. I've told all my friends and we're now totally converted to Heel Smoother users."
4,Replacement for same product that broke,"I previously had the identical product which broke due to batteries leaking. It works for me before, so I decided to go with the same product again."
3,Doesn't quite do the job but has good features,"I purchased the Artemis after seeing an ad in a magazine. I was looking for a portable heel sander that during the summer, I could use after showering or swimming. I was disappointed that it didn't come with an A/C adapter. The power of two AA batteries doesn't do the job. The tips are high quality and abrasive enough to smoothe even the tough skin your feet if only the motor was stronger! I had really high hopes that the Artemis would be a convenient, quick way to keep my heels maintained on a daily basis. Unfortunately this isn't the case and I am back to a corded sander. I did give it a 3 since it is well made and the tips are superior to other similar products on the market."
3,"Okay, but not great","I haven't been able to find anything better than this on the market, but overall I was expecting this product to be a lot stronger. I was hoping it would work as well as the devices used at a professional salon. To call it a ""Pro-pedicure device"" is misleading. Even on the strongest setting, it fails to really do any strong filing. In fact, the rotary will stop turning if you put even the slightest pressure on it. I feel like it's better than nothing, and I will continue to use it, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Terrible Product,I bought and returned this product. It has little power and did not do the job for my feet--even after soaking them first. This is not for bad or heavily callused feet. I suggest spending your money on a better product.
3,Not worth the money,I don't believe the Heel Smoother Pro is worth the money. I would not recommend it because of the cost.
3,soccer 07,"My nephew likes the good graphics on this game and he likes the authenticity of the voices, accents and all. He also likes the way the players are able to move in the game."
5,The best soccer game so far!,"Although it makes blister on my finger (coz I play it too long all the times), I love this game. There are many mode you can play in this game. The graphic is great. I only play the action mode (friendly match and tournament). I still have no time to play the manager mode yet. Graphic is great! the music is awesome. It is easy to play...the control is quite intuitive. If you love football (or soccer), this game is highly recommended. At this moment it is the best soccer game by far. Fun..Fun..Fun......"
1,An example of self-hatred and internalized homophobia,"This book should insult any gay man who considers himself to be an intellectual. Full of faulty logic, purple prose, gross generalizations, and accounts of Browning's crusing experiences, the textoffers a disturbing, degrading picture of homosexuality. Despite a section on the works of Michel Foucault, the text demonstrates no knowledge of political ontology; also, the text avoids mentioning the works of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and David Halperin, but it posits Camille Paglia as an intellectual diety--look out! The correlation between coming out and becoming ""born again"" just doesn't work: the former is an outward, social/public event, and the latter is an inward, spiritual one. Nonetheless, the cover of the book reproduces a beautifu, homoeroticl print by Paul Cadmus."
2,Makes a better audio recording than a video.,"Unfortunately, this video was not at all what I expected. I bought it used not really thinking much except that I was curious about it's ""original Pooh"" drawing on the front. My husband said that this video would make a better listening tape than a video & I would have to agree. Maybe it's my generation now that is impatient & bored with watching a grown British man recite a book or maybe it's just the video? ... The video would be more captivating if Storyteller Willy was not shown much at all & the drawings were more a part of the storyline."
1,Why is this man shouting the story at the camera?,"I do not recommend...much better to buy the book and read it to your kids than to watch a man sitting in a field loudly reciting the story as the camera occasionally zooms in on line drawings. I didn't want the Disney version, but this BBC edition is unbelievably dull."
5,Perfect for the REAL fans,"Truly enjoyable, without being insulting to your intelligence (like a certain other animated version...) Many people may not have calm enough spirits to appreciate this, but if you find the original books relaxing, then you should welcome this video, featuring Shepard's original illustrations, read by Willie Rushton, a friendly narrator who seems to enjoy his job, telling the tale from the physical setting of the book."
5,Charming! Captures the spirit of the original books.,"Willy Rushton's wonderfully witty storytelling makes the original characters come alive in this video filmed on location in the real ""hundred acre wood."" This has been a family favorite since our children were small, and we still love it."
2,Things that make you go hmmmm,"I agree this would do better as audio only. Can't help thinking it sounds a bit like if Monty Python did Winne the Pooh. When Willy Rushton is reading off the numbered list of how to capture Roo all I can think of is the scene from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" where they're reading the directions about counting to the number three when removing the holy grail. Doubt this, as a video, will hold the attention long of today's typical kid. Would be a relaxing listen too, however, at bed or nap time."
4,Winnie The Pooh BBC EDITION,This video everyone in your house will like it. Its not boring and winnie the pooh always hs something up his sleave not the same thing always different you will like it alot i guarantee it.
2,Only Gives You About 20% Of The Full Treatment System!!!,"I have been using the Bowen Therapy system for 1- years now and I can say that it is defiantly a great technique. I am a licensed soft tissue therapist so I have the opportunity to use it quite frequently. It is well worth learning. However, I was hopping to use the video as a training tool and refresher for the Bowen system but it only presents the first 3 basic moves (low back, upper back & neck). This represents about 20% of the full system. If you were going to treat someone with low back pain you would want to know the other moves that can effect the low back. You may give the treatment to a friend or loved one and not get the response that you were looking for because their back pain may involve the pelvis, hamstrings, knee, feet, etc. and you do not get these treatment moves in this video. Just be aware that there is a lot more to Bowen Therapy then is in this video."
1,WARNING THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,"Don't waste your time with this B grade, independent film. It looks like it was shot in a parking garage. The plot was so slow and very terrible. The special effects, lets just say left a lot to be desired. I think they should take their cam corder and go back to the drawing board again."
1,Posibbly the Worst Film Ever Made,"I know my horror movies, and when a friend (he was punished for this) said I JUST HAD TO WATCH this movie, I said ok. He said it was gory and silly, and just a fun horror movie, fun like Dead Alive. No, it was not. I could have shot a better horror movie using my cell phone.There is no plot (at least not one that I could follow), no attempt at any kind of special effects or gore, no real actors (I sincerely hope they're not real actors), and nothing scary whatsoever. I ended up falling asleep at some point, and then fast-forwarded through the end thinking that maybe you just had to wait for a spectacular ending like in Audition, but no; the movie kept going and going, the characters hanging out and talking in some warehouse until it finally ended.I want my two hours back!!!"
4,"Rather informative book on transsexualism, lots of reference","This is a very well written book on the subject of gender dysphoria and transsexualism. It is written by a transsexual herself, but does not focus mostly on her despite the title. There is a lot of information within the book, and lots of references to follow up research. Quite professionally written. Main drawback: too professional at times, and may lose some readers even with the glossary. Even though I am transsexual myself I had some hard times to follow along, but a quick review helped afterwards. I would reccomend this book to any transsexual or their family or friends who would like to know more on the subject. It is written mostly with a Canadian view, but much of it applies throughout the world."
5,Wonderful,"This movie is a very touching and captivating story. Having seen both verisions - original and remastered, I really was impressed with the remastered version. I will watch this movie over and over again - with pleasure."
3,Remastered does NOT equal Restored Buyer Beware,I wish I had read the reviews for this particular DVD more closely.The REMASTERED version leaves a lot to be desired.There were visual and audio defects abundantly evident in this copy--enough so that I was put off by the price I paid which was a bit more than other copies listed of the same DVD.I was not impressed with this copy for the price.Wish I had gone with a cheaper offering.I was particularly put off by the visual defect near the end of the picture that appeared to be a result of the copying process.REMASTERED in this case does not equal the quality of RESTORED.
2,Don't get remastered,Remastered to me implied a good picture and sound. The picture stopped several times for a few seconds and the color was almost blurry and not crisp. Storyline; you can't expect anything else from F.S. Fitzgerald.
1,Season 1&2 great Season 3-6 Terrible,for the first 2 seasons it is a great show. but it ruins itself in season 3 when Quigly loses his fortune and gets it back without an explaination of how. and then kills off the 2 main characters while in the processes driving Father Clifford from the faith.
2,"Speculative conspiracy theory, not history","In this gargantuan volume, Michael Hickey presents a conspiracy theory in the aftermath of the death of Warren Earp (Wyatt's brother) that would perhaps do credit to a JFK assasination buff, but hardly qualifies as good history. To accept his conclusions, in my opinion, requires the reader to discard logic and common sense. There is a wealth of primary source material presented, and for that I will give the book two stars, but I do not advocate that anyone read this book in the expectation of learning the truth."
3,HE THOUGHT HE WAS WYATT (AT LEAST WHEN HE WAS DRUNK),"I have often kidded Michael Hickey and Lee Silva about their works passing the test for weight and density. Perhaps we need a word for this sort of publication and I suggest ""bulkritude.""Lots of broad brush general history of interest, but as Bruce Trinque comments in another of his ""right on"" views, accepting the logic of this book would be a helluva pill to swallow.If you do buy it, ask the publisher to send along with it a scrap of carpet such as used traditionally in the American past to wrap around bricks to use as doorstops. He is a good fellow and might actually send one. Don't expect a Bokara, however."
5,Great Book for Bilinguals,"Finally there is a useful book written for bilinguals. The author helps to better understand the different issues that we encounter in the job market. It begins with the current trends in the Hispanic labor market, cultural strengths, and the basics for a successful career. What I like most is the way that she structured the book: by separating the top 7 industries for bilinguals, you don't have to read the entire book to find out how things are in your field. It does a good job describing specific requirements for each job and it gives average earning information. It will not give you specific names of companies. Instead, it gives you organizations through you can network. I recommend this book for anyone who would like to achieve more by taking advantage of their bilingual skills."
2,No so great but thanks for trying,"Although I enjoyed reading Ms. Kenig's book, I didn't find much value in the information presented for two reasons: 1) the bulk of the book is a compilation of data that can be easily obtained for free from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and 2)most of the inferences about the Latino labor market are made based on anecdotal information; there was no research done by the author to substantiate her points.I commend the author for writing a book on the subject, but the content needs much substance and depth."
3,Not that Great,"Considering that this book cost [more $] than books of this genre and size usually cost, the quality is not very good.Gilder uses excellent prose and superb metaphors, but the book does not nail central issue...the issue of WHEN.He says how the world will be so greatly revolutionized by infinite bandwidth, but never once does he offer a speculative timeline. What can we expect by 2010? By 2020? That is what people want to see, and the lack of is is why it is selling so poorly compared to Ray Kurzweil's 'Age of Spiritual Machines'.Overall, save you [$], and instead buy two books with the money, the aforementioned Kurzweil book and 'Entering Space' by Robert Zubrin."
3,ranges from compulsively readable to mind numbingly annoying,"Gilder's writing style is verbiose and lively. He poetically waxes mad philosophical luminescence, resonating and pontificating over the coming harmonies of bandwidth abundance, the ascendant technologies that act as its conduits, and wives thereof, to be grossly humane.It was cool at first to read such a colorful account of hi-tech, but over the course of the book his manic style wore on me a bit. Towards the end there was a lack of solid material and everything started to sound repetitive and overwrought. Still, this is a fast read, and even though it's a bit dated in the short term, over the long term a lot of his predictions will probably turn out to be true. And although none of his predictions are *that* earth-shattering, this is still an interesting account of what the future world of telecommunications will look like."
2,Not much to say that hasn't been said...,"...it is a very technical book. If you are looking for a book to explain it to you in a way you will understand, this is not the book for you, especially if you know very little. I realize its unfair to rate it two stars when the book was not written with someone like me in mind, but, hey, I couldn't understand much of it so I can't rate it higher than that."
4,He's grown up since the 1980's,"George Gilder has always had a gift for writing common-sense economics we can all appreciate. In this book, he shows his abilities extended into prediction -- growth! Better still, he has stopped his prating about building up the White male at the expense of everybody else and has given us a glimpse of a future transformed by telecommunications, in which everyone will participate (like it or not) or be left behind (and nobody cares what color or sex you are on the Internet!) He offers advice every business had better hear in order to keep up (that's right -- if you want our business, you'd better make it convenient and on time, or we'll shop elsewhere! And don't think I'll waste my time watching all those irrelevant commercials, either!) He's right on target here, and very readable, as always, though his prose is a little overblown. Best of his work, so far!"
1,WHEN???,"Gilder never says WHEN certain milestones are expected. THe only sentence that touches the subject is 'sure, the acts of wasting time will hang around the house for another decade or so', but other than that he does not state when certain capabilites will be attained for the user.I think the 'last mile' problem is an excuse. Sure, it would be logistically very hard to get high-capacity fiber to homes, but the larger office buildings and universities could get it very shortly. Then, consumers will simply use the high bandwidth at work to download their files onto ZIP of CD-RW, and then take it home. High bandwidth will be effectively available to users long before they need it in the home.The new World Trade Center will probably go directly to fiber."
3,Interesting Analysis,"While ""Telecosm"" is now a bit dated, the analysis laid out in this book is interesting and sheds light on the potential for the world at large in an era of ubiquitous bandwidth. Gilder offers readers technical and business perspectives on a world of unlimited bandwidth, and does so in an engaging a readable manner.Things in the world in general, not to mention in the business and technical spheres, have changed dramatically since ""Telecosm"" was published in the year 2000. Despite the facts that bandwidth might not be as ubiquitous as projected and bandwidth availability might not have had the magnitude of the effects projected in this book, it is still worth a read.Well-research and logically-conveyed, ""Telecosm"" offers a unique historical viewpoint of a potential future."
1,Bla-bla-bla,"Terrible book. It reads like ""bla-bla-bla"". I'm very close of disposing it in the waste basket. I'm not learning anything from it."
3,dumbed down technical info.,"If science and technology aren't your thing, but your curious, this is a good book. Besides the telecom lesson, the book offers advice on how to invest in telecom stocks.The book talks about abundance of supply, so the Internet bubble had to burst according to the book."
4,Entertaining - a look into the not too distant future.,"Intrigueing look to the future of IT and the extension of infinite access into nearly all areas of our lives. Many aspects i was allready aware of, but i still learned and gained some new insights. Good read!"
1,Yet another in a long line of Euro-Centric viewpoints...,"This one has a but just a few intriguing photographs of our friend: the bison.However, portions of the text follow a decidedly definite Euro-centric point of view with regard both the bison and the indigenous (""Native American"") population of this land prior to European ""settlement.""Lacking is virtually any reference to the deep and significant reverence with which the bison was held by the indigenous population.Having written the above, just wish to let the authoress know that we indians are surer glad all you white folks came and showed us what to do with the bison bison.It seems a shame a tree or two had to give it's very all for this particular tome.My advice: skip it. Lots of better ""bison books"" out there !"
1,Poorly designed cell phone holder,"I tried to use this cell phone holder with my Motorola V600 and it worked very poorly. Every time I hit a bump or pothole on the road, the phone came off. The spring is not strong enough to hold the phone firmly in place. I am very disappointed with this product. Nevertheless, you get what you pay for. Next time around, I'll opt for a higher end cell phone holder."
5,Actionfull time travel,"Trapped by victorious Nazi Germany, future USA comes back to Second World War. USA and its allies then didn't know about the German atomic bomb. Now a commando force is going to teach them,if they still have time.But the Nazis have an misterious helper, and time is big enough for more interested parties to get in the play.The details, international cenaries, historical personages are outstanding.Don't miss this book."
2,"Disappointing, I can't recommend this book.","I am interested in alternate history, science fiction, World War 2, and Winston Churchill, but I couldn't get enthusiastic about this book. The plot was not very interesting or suspenseful. The characters seemed undeveloped - I didn't care about any of them. A real disappointment."
4,A Fertile Plot,"Yes, the characters may be a bit cardboardish. Yes, the writing might be a tad clunky. But Hogan makes up for all of his mechanical shortcomings by inundating the reader with massive amounts of plot -- and I loved every minute of it. It's been so long since I've read a purely plot-driven novel, and it was refreshing.The main character of this novel is probably Ferracini, whom we most identify with since we experience most of the book with him. He's a special-ops kind of guy who doesn't understand everything but carries out the various missions to safeguard our world from Nazi Germany and Co. Winston Churchill would probably get second billing, and he's as colorful as ever.There's a lot of science and history in this novel, but Hogan never under- or overexplains. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable read. History buffs and scifi fans will both get something out of this novel."
1,THIS IS THE PITS,"SORRY BUT I GOT THIS FOR MY KINDLE THROUGH MY LIBRARY. STOPPED READING IT. ITS THE PITS. THE BOOK IS LIKE WATCHING A MOVIE IN A THEATRE YOU PAID FOR YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD FINISH WATCHING IT BUT....I JUST COULD NOT FINISH READING IT. WAS TO POORLY WRITTEN, CHARACTERS WERE JUST AWFUL AND I AM NOT SURE I WOULD READ ANY OF HER BOOKS AGAIN.DONT BUY IT AND DONT READ IT.THERE - I SAID IT NOW DO IT"
3,Mediocre,"The story is a bit unoriginal, but it's still a good summertime short read. The heroine is a bit too goody-goody and unrealistic for a modern day woman and she protests too much. The hero is the typical Alpha male who has everything, but has never fallen in love. The ending works out a little too well . . . matches the rainbow on the cover. I've always liked Iris Johanson's writing, although I don't remember it being this fluffy. Overall, ok, but probably not worth the cover price. The book was a lot shorter than I expected."
4,Well-produced J-Pop,"The attraction of foreign-language pop music is that since I have no idea what the lyrics are, I can't be insulted/embarrassed by the dumbness of the lyrics. That sounds like a an excuse for this album, but it's not. Mayu's debut album has the great single Nakanaide, produced by Masayuki Ishii(look for more from this producer!) which is just plain well-sequenced pop (I'm not sure I hear any live musicians in this song, but the skill of the producer makes up for it). The singing is soulful and rich, not tinny and over-feminine as are many female jpop vocalists. A nice CD to have in rotation on your CD carousel or MP3 player for a splash of above-average world pop."
3,Decent but not great,"The album isn't bad, but it's not really all that good either. Gus is much better at power metal than at death metal. Their newer stuff is better. I recommend this album only if you want an okay album. It's okay, but it's not great."
5,Nightrage top their 1st release,"Nightrage's 1st CD ""Sweet Vengence"" was a great melodic death metal CD, but it seemed like the songs lacked focus a little. Although the songs were good, there wasn't really a consistent sound and it kind of left me wondering where they were headed. ""Descent Into Chaos"" is much tighter and shows that the band is pushing towards the heavier end of the melodic death sound. While their 1st CD had both great and so-so songs, ""Descent Into Chaos"" is amazing from start to finish. To me Tomas Lindberg's voice has always been just o.k., but the foundation of Nightrage is the songwriting and guitar work of Marios Iliopoulos and Gus G. All of the songs are good but check out Being Nothing, Phantasma, Poems, Descent Into Chaos, Jubilant Cry, Reality Vs. Truth, and the excellent instrumental Solus for highlights. In my opinion this is the 2nd best metal CD this year behind Dark Tranquility."
1,scar gel - NOT,"I used the entire tube as directed, did absolutely nothing for my scars from recent surgery (1 year old scars). A big waste of money."
2,not quite there,"This book is just too long. If it were condensed to sub-100 pages it might be worthwhile as it contains some interesting ideas. Unfortunately most of the examples begin with ""Cisco decided to.."", ""At Cisco we..., ""The Cisco method of..."" ......you get the idea. The authors cite ""Good to Great"" which is a real contrast, because the Collins team examines a wide variety of companies and industries rather than simply concentrating on Cisco. The book is also packed with graphics that -- let's face it folks -- are simply meaningless. I do not understand the reason for the other glowing reviews. Mediocre ""at best""."
2,Tower of Babble,"I thought Silicon Valley was for smart people. A Stanford professor and a retired Cisco executive have managed to write one of the most indecipherable business tombs in recent memory. I was asked to review this book for graduate school and I found it mostly incoherent business babble. ""Billiard Ball Management."" ""Shallowly Rooted Strategic Vectors."" ""Kinetic Structures Prevail."" What kinds of business leaders talk like that today? I often find the best business books package challenging business problems with no non-sense solutions. Save your money. This book is a tower of babble."
5,Inspiring,"A man called Peter is inspiring to say the least. It reminds us of the purpose that God has for all of our lives, and encourages us to seek him to use us to the fullest extent possible. He certainly did that with Peter Marshall."
3,No better than Koop,"Hearing the new one item by Koop my advice is to have it, but expect something completely different than the first one...I don't like the sound of the 20`s , 30's & 40's jazz, 'cause I like specially trios and piano than orchestras...but this record has 3 or 4 little gems...and that's why it worths to have it!"
4,Ethereal Jazz,"Koop is like 50's music beamed from earth, that has finally been captured by a spaceship radio in the distant future except you get to hear it now! Smart and fun. Break out the bubbly and popcorn."
5,Great Album!!,"I am a huge fan of Waltz for Koop and all the remixes that followed and I must commend Koop for an amazing new record. The only unfortunate thing is that the album is way too short, but it is a must have regardless of the length!!"
2,"great topic, poor writing",This book could have been absolutely amazing because of the interest and excitement of the topic.Unfortunately it was horrifically written and a struggle to get through.The author definitely focused on the wrong parts of the story of Mclean Hospital.
4,The story of a mental hospital,"McLean was once the premier place for the crazy relatives of the rich. They lived in a style similar to the one they left, closely observed by attendants. It evolved into a more modern facility to its detriment and ends the century with a portion dedicated to the same type of patient they once served. The author tells an interesting story of the hospital with several anecdotal stories. I wish there had been more of those and less uninteresting details, but I enjoyed the book and its history of mental illness and its treatments."
3,Not as page turning as I thought it would be.,"I was bored in some parts, it was interesting in other parts. And sometimes it was almost scattered, I didn't find most of it that well put together. And towards the end, it was hard for me to stay involved.Other then that, it talks about shock treatment, insulin therapy. The famous people who stayed there, who WANTED to stay there. And the doctors behind the scenes.Overall I give it a 3 out of 5 stars."
1,Boring,"I was really hoping that this book would focus on more of what treatments that the hospital provided, instead of its rich patients."
3,Tedious,"This book would be better described as the history of an elite mental health institution, the likes of which most of us will never see. Indeed, at the end the only remnant left of 'the old days' is a 'ward' for the super-rich.It's also painfully apparent that the author has no understanding or serious conception what mental illness (or for that matter being in a 'standard' 21st century mental ward) is actually like.Decent if you're looking for a historical perspective of McLean, rubbish if you're looking at empathy or understanding or destigmatization of mental illness."
3,Unbalanced,"I was disappointed in this book, especially after all the good reviews. The book is heavy on gossip, real estate issues and miscellaneous information. It is annoying that the author belittles psychiatry since it is apparent that he lacks a knowledge and understanding of it. He also seems to be negative about McLean at any point in its history and that just doesn't fit with the facts. I was hoping for a more balanced, good story. Instead, I felt that I had read a book by a person prejudiced about its subject, selective about the facts and lacking in analysis."
4,Haven't read just yet,"The book was received in great condition. I haven't had time to read it yet, but the reviews on the back and inside covers are promising. It is next on my read list."
1,"not mate finish at all, not good sunscreen either","This is not a mate finish sunscreen at all, it is oily and smells like the the cheapest sunblock in the market, the worst thing about it is it does not protect you from the sun using it you get burn and red. So if you are locking for a mate finish sunscreen for your face this is not for you. I would give it one more start if at least it would protect me from the sun, but it is not even good for that. bad sunblock, bad smell, bad finish"
4,"Good, but parts are dated","The Television Production handbook does a great job with explaining the basic principles of television production and direction. If you're lucky enough to get a copy with Zettl's VideoLab CD, that's almost as good as the book. My only complaint is that some of the images in the book seem a little dated for a book that was published in 1999. But overall, good book, good value. -MW"
2,Listen to the real thing instead,"What's the point of listening to Sarah's songs if you can't hear her beautiful voice singing them? This guitar tribute could have been worse. But like most tributes, ignore it."
1,"Negligent of McLachlan's artistry, even down to mispelling of song titles!","These arrangements are very poorly done and it's often hard to tell which of Sarah McLachlan's songs each of these ""tributes"" are trying to feel like. As a fan of Sarah's music, I found this very disappointing. The fact that two of the printed song titles: ""aida"", which should be ADIA, and ""word on fire"", which should be WORLD on Fire, are mispelled should be a further embarrassment to whomever produced or marketed this album. Mistakes like this are ridiculous, unprofessional and unneccessary... This album is not worthy of being associated with Sarah McLachlan and her strive for precision in her artistry in any way, shape or form."
1,item does not exist,"eddie bauer dvd player with a 5"" detachable screen is not an item that is even manufactured. Eddie bauer dvd player is an audiovox dvd player with a signature of eddie bauer. This item has a fixed screen which cannot be removed from the unit."
1,Bad investment,"This DVD player worked for about 20 hours, then stopped playing DVDs. It had a 3 month warranty. There is no repair site in the instruction book. We won't purchase any electronics with an Eddie Bauer name on it."
4,Nurse Incognito,"'When a love affair between a nurse and a doctor goes wrong, the unhappiness of the situation is naturally increased if they have to go on working in the same hospital. That was why Caroline was glad to get away from St. Keverne's...and Brandon...to a temporary job in the lovely Bahamas.It was disconcerting, though for her to find herself in the middle of a family feud.Her first loyalty was to the old lady who employed her, but she couldn't help liking and trusting Roland Dayler and sympathizing with his refusal to give up his children; couldn't help either, liking (though she didn't trust) that ""wicked"" younger brother whose bad reputation was enough to make any woman look twice at him.'"
4,Christmas Songs from Many Nations - Flawlessly Sung,"The first 18 tracks on this CD are from an LP of the same name that was a family favorite of ours since the 60s. The vocals are very precise, with noticeable German accents (especially on ""Jesus Rest Your Head""). The Trapps, directed by Fr. Wasner, perform songs from their native Austria, including the hauntingly beautiful Scheibendudler (a kind of solemn jodler). Some listeners may not much like their rendition of traditional English or American songs (Deck the Halls, Jesus Rest Your Head). The less familiar Latin and foreign songs are a real treat. Favorites are ""A la Nanita"" (Spanish), Nu ar de Jul Igen (Swedish), and ""Zu Bethlehem Geboren"" (German). Most songs are done a capella, although there is recorder accompaniment on one or two. A songbook containing the first 18 songs with music is available from Amazon. All in all, a fine recording and great change of pace from the more usual Christmas music."
4,The Beer Man.,"This is a very informative book from a very impressive beer connoisseur. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because he neglects Stone Brewing Company which in my opinion is one of the best Brewing Companies in the world. The main aspect of this book that is so great is that he gives reviews and descriptions of beers that a lot of people would be unfamiliar with. Such as beers from the Czech Republic. Also Michael Jackson gives critics on beers throughout the world. It is very impressive because he covers so many countries in this book. Another thing that is typical of Michael Jackson's book is his excellent descriptions of the types of beer and also the ingredients in beer. This is very educational, and if you want to know of some great beers this is a very informative guide."
4,Everything you need to know,"This book covers (almost) all of the bases necessary for transfer students to learn about. One of the most helpful elements was the comments integrated throughout the book of real-life transfer counselors and admissions experts, offering their tips on how to get into some of the best schools in the country."
5,Keep this book next to your reading place,"This is one of the most wonderful meditations on the Gospels that you will ever find. It provides insight that you will find in no other author's work.I've only read it once. This week, I'm going to read it yet again."
4,"Excellent book, decent condition","I think this book has a great way of bringing you before Scripture, and Buechner has a unique perspective that he expresses very well. For some people, it might seem like a bit of work to keep up with, but not for everybody. Definitely worth the time."
4,"Telling the Truth : The Gosepl as Tragedy, Comedy, and Fairy Tale, by Frederick Buechner","It will make you laugh out loud, and in a minute you might shed a tear. Buechner's approach to the four gospels is refreshing, amusing, and very sobering. And he throws in a few Torah stories to add flavor to the stew. It will change your perspective on reading the Bible, and give you a new way to look at its characters. It's nice to know that our heroes were merely human, but they stepped up to the challenge when God called. That's what separates them from the rest of mere mortals."
4,A wonderfully funny romance,This book made me laugh so hard I almost fell out of my bed. The story is about a woman in modern times who's fiance wants her to sign a prenuptial agreement. This sends her off to climb a mountain. She is minding her own business when her guardian angel in training sneezes and sends her back to the 1890's! She is very confused about all of this and so is the hero and his children who have seen her practically fall out of the sky. The handsome Oklahoma cowboy is trying to find out who is behind the damage happening to his ranch and is suspicious of the woman who is wearing strange clothing. But he is also highly attracted to her and when they finally admit that they have fallen for each other he is unsure of whether she will stay with him or not. The secondary characters of the guardian angel in training and his trainer are hilarious and had me in tears. The scene with the cow is the best. Pick this book up for sure.
5,I WISH I HAD IT NOW!!!,"OK...EVERYDAY FROM AGE 2-6 I WOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE AND THE SILLYVILLE MOVIE! I LOVED THESE MOVIES! AND THEN MY MOM GAVE THEM AWAY! JUST A COUPLE DAYS AGO I WENT TO A FRIENDS HOUSE TO WATCH A MOVIE AND I SAW THE ""WEE SING IN SILLYVILLE"" MOVIE! I JUST HAD TO WATCH IT! NOW I AM BEGGING MY MOM TO LET ME BUY THIS ONE AND THE SILLYVILLE ONE! AND I AM 13 YRS OLD! I REMEMBER BITS AND PIECES OF BOTH MOVIES BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY DAY TO DAY VIEWING! WHEN I SAW THESE MOVIESON LINE ...I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE THEM AGAIN! WHEN I WAS AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE I SANG ALONG! AND SO DID SHE! IF YOU GET THIS MOVIE, YOU WONT BE SORRY!"
5,"A worthy alternative to ""Five Live Yardbirds""","I was lucky enough to get the complete ""Five Live Yardbirds"" when Rhino briefly released it in the early 1980's. Inevitably, this new CD will be compared to it - after all, it has much the same song list. Happily, ""Live Blueswailing"" compares VERY well. The crowd is more sedate but still enthusiasic, the sound is clearer, the band's playing is crisper, Keith Relf banters more with the audience, and Clapton fans have one more fine E. C. performance to savor - the CD's closing track, ""The Sky Is Crying."" If you can't get your hands on the complete ""Five Live,"" this is a great substitute; even if you can, this is a fine supplement."
1,this is bad bootleg quality,this is BAD reproductions of stuff you can get in much better focus etc on other KISS unauthorized DVDs that are out there now. KISS Cat Tales comes to mind.
5,Exquisite book,"I can hardly believe what I read in the review here just before mine! What was this person thinking???I'm a poet of many years and have read reams of poetry, particularly women's poetry, and this is one of the loveliest, most evocative books I've come across in years.Visually stunning, the contents lives up to the cover, particularly in poems like ""My Mother's Hair,"" ""The Bath,"" ""The Last Moon of Pregnancy"" and ""Apple Picking.""I only hope to hear more from this author."
3,Why You Should Not Believe In God,"There is a principle that is more important than either science or religion.It is the principle that belief requires evidence and extraordinary beliefsrequire extraordinary evidence. Faith is simply wrong. An unsound principle.What little evidence there is in support of the existence of a god orgods is more than outweighed by the evidence against. And even if itwere not it would only be strong enough to lend support to a pantheisticgod or some other similar weak claim.The gods of the common world religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam,etc.) claim so many powers that belief in them would require much moreextraordinary evidence. In fact, there is so little evidence one should noteven believe than Moses or Christ ever existed as historical figures."
1,"Nothing impressive, nothing new.","Mackie gives the standard atheist critiques of religion and theistic philosophy. He seems to have no appreciation for the nuances involved in this issue. For a less polemical and even-handed approach, I would reccomend An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion by Brian Davies."
5,How do you review a Bill Evans Album,Simply put I'm not qualified to review a Bill Evans product. I'm not a good enough musician. I can tell you that I enjoy it because it's good in my opinion. I'll bet trained musicians would say the same. As for me I recommend it for your jazz collection.
5,another super tale from Shannon!,"Colleen Shannon has quietly given us super tales for long time now. I know when I pick up one of her books I am really going to enjoy this. Frankly, I am surprised she has not received more attention for the quality work she does.Heaven's Rogue is an example of Shannon's fresh approach to romance. Honoria Psyche Fitzhugh is a curator at an art museum. He latest acquisition is a statue of the perfect man. He career is on the line when it is proclaimed a fake. But Honor knows the real ""thing"" when she see it. However, with her career in ruins, so goes into to say goodbye to the statue, and her tears end up bringing surprising results.Dominico Castiglione, has travelled 500 years into the further but was trapped in stone until the tears of a virginal Honor awoke him. He must seek out his relatives or be lost, naturally Honor is along for the chase and romance blooms.It is a witty tale that will keep you smiling to the end!"
5,I really loved the premise of this book.,"The storyline of this book really drew me in. The herion's lifelong dream of the perfect man embodied in Dom is the most wonderful character. His ego and everyday male charcateristics add so much humor and intrigue to the book that you just keep turning pages, not to mention what all his other perfectly made attributes add to the romance scenes."
2,rogue ok but not as good as 2nd book,"book was ok, but I was expecting something more centered in Florence like the 2nd book. I might have liked it better if I had read them in order"
5,The Doorbell Rang,"I have been reading Pat Hutchins books to children for many years. They are all wonderful. The Doorbell Rang is great for learning problem solving, math concepts,and the joy and sometimes the dilemma of sharing!"
4,Great Toddler Book!,"this book is written in a fun and repetitive style, so that its offers a surprise element and yet predictable text for the child. everyday my 2.5 year-old would ask me to read this favourite book to her, and each time she would be as excited as the first time we read this book, to tell me to flip to the next page to see who rang the bell. i would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun read with a young child."
3,Good.,"This FPS is one of the greatest of all. The enemy AI is very well done (those who say that the AI doesn't react when they stand in front of the enemy, either they have a problem with their game or something else because its impossible the AI doesn't react). The storyline is also interesting. The game is very very hard even in easy mode. The soundtrack reminds me of Indiana Jones. Worth the purchase."
3,One BIG problem: the walthrough,"Overall, it is an OK game. The only major problem is the walkthrough: there's no map which causes me to wonder where I should go. This is a big mistake since the game is based on secret missions. The objectives are not clear: you die before knowing (or not even) what to do. You'll have to rely on walkthrough of people who've played before. Since were not people from the 1940s, we need some guidelines about what are what."
1,Shoddy Vendors,"This game might be good if the player could ever get it to operate. It was so terrible and the EA people over in Redwood City - not far from my house - have an attitude best described as ""Mox Nicks"" - - - so I returned it to you guys via parcel post with your label - which you kindly provide with your software over the net - on or about 3 July 2003. To date I've heard nothing from you. Would you be so kind as to indicate to me what disposition you've made of this turkey???"
3,Medal of Honor,"The product was as advertised. Fast shipping. No problems with the seller whatsoever. However, game won't play after properly being downloaded in our new computers. We've loaded tons of games before over the years and never had this problem. Our computers meet the games requirements..."
3,Good intro to Buddhism but too voluminous for what it offers,"This is an easy to read book that touches on some basics on Tibetan Buddhism and meditation techniques. Although it briefly explains the basics, this book is not about the Buddha and Tibetan (Mahayana or Dzogchen) Buddhism. It is more about the views and experiences of a westerner (Lama Surya Das) who spent some time in Tibet and studied Buddhism. Overall, it is a positive book that is primarily focused on meditation for beginners. With that said, I found it a bit challenging to go through the entire 400 pages of it."
3,"Pleasant, but ""watered down"", tries to be too ""hip"" for me.","I bought both this and ""Natural Perfection"", a newer 4 tape series by the same author. This was more pleasant and well done. The other one was very redundant, basically the same info spread out. I highly recommend the book ""The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying"" by Sogyal Rinpoche to be a much more genuine, beautiful, easy to read look at the Tibetan Buddhist world than this author can seem to provide. It all seems very ""watered down"" to me, way too much for Americans to grasp the beauty of the Tibetan concepts. you might as well buy any current self help guide, which was not what I was looking for."
5,Enlightened and enlightening,"My second all-time favorite book, Awakening the Buddha Within has been such a dear and constant companion to me over the years, nearly all the passages are underlined, circled, boxed, starred, and the pages are dog-eared and falling out.This is an enlightening book for any stage of the spiritual journey. Written in a friendly, warm-hearted style that tells it like it is without ever feeling preachy, Lama Surya Das has truly captured the Dharma heart of Tibetan Buddhism. It is deceptively simple and fun to read. While it's easy for beginners to understand, it contains all the depth that advanced practitioners could wish for. I can turn to any page of this book at any time and find something immediately helpful.I am deeply grateful for the compassionate wisdom I have found countless times in these pages. This wonderful book will always be a treasured friend. Thank you, Lama Surya!"
4,Good,"Like many other reviewers here I thought this book was a bit dharma-lite. But for me that is not a bad thing - most books on Tibetan Buddhism are incredibly scholoarly, heavy and - in my opinion - much too serious. So I was pleased when this book came along. I recommended it to many people interested in Buddhism (together with Sogyal Rinpoche's book on Living and Dying) who would have been turned off by your typical book on Tibetan Buddhism."
5,buddhism acessible for the west,"lama surya das is unique-did thre rigorous 3 year lama training program three times and yet remains very grounded in the west, and very humorous, as when he explains the noble truth on clinging in terms of velcro and non grasping in terms of teflon so as not to burn the mental frying pan. funny, yet kosher buddhism. a lama for the west today"
4,A great book to use as an introduction to Buddhism,"A lot of books on the Buddhist religion are intimadating , however this one starts simply with practices most people can do. I found it greatly beneficial to use, it helped me with my meditation and with everyday life."
4,Well worth the time to read,"I really enjoyed this book as an introduction to Buddism. The author shares his personal stories which makes you feel more and learn more. It's a long book with much detail...some times too much if your looking for an easy read. But, if you want a better understanding about being a buddist, you owe it to yourself to take the time and enjoy this well written book."
5,The first step,"This text provides the student with his/her first step into a much larger world. Practical, easily understandable. As a beginner, I feel it was the appropriate first text to greater understand buddhist principles, concepts, and theories - and their application to living in Western society."
5,All you Need!,"this book is the only book you need to inspire you and to learn about buddhism. i had read one other book prior to it as i was wanting to learn about buddhism and this book far surpasses the other one. it's like having a teacher speak plainly to you in a way that you can understand and appreciate. i work with a buddhist and i've been sharing my books and he agreed that this one is good. great not just for buddhists, but for anyone seeking the answers to a better life. highly recommended."
5,"This is one for the top shelf, and the nightstand","I am a Christian who has read many great works from many accomplished masters of Buddhism, including HH Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh. Lama Surya Das is a saint with a pen (and a reasonable sense of humor) who is able to complement existing Western texts on Buddhism, while also nourishing the seeds those earlier books had planted. And he does so in a way that affirms each our own respective faith. I don't easily give a book five stars -- it had to earn them. I bought an extra copy to loan out while I re-read much of my own copy, which I am sure I will do for years to come."
2,"Deeds, Not Words","Surya Das is obviously a convincing teacher, and in this he does good. And unfortunately, as Gurdjieff noted, the cheif trait of human beings is their gullability. While Tibetan Buddhism is an extraordinary path of spiritual unfoldment, and there are scores of remarkable teachers and realized beings in this tradtion, Surya Das himself is anything but. He is a hypster, of whom most of his Tibetan teachers are ashamed. Though he capitalizes on their identities all over his web site, they are too polite (Tibetan style) to beg him to remove them from any association with him. He was a laughing stock among his peers in his training days, and now holds himself as a self-styled guru. While he may help begginers, he ultimately dissapontts as a hypocrite whose inner world really revolves around self-agrandisement. Read teachers like Tenzin Wangyal or so many other lamas who speak from experience, not cleverness."
2,"""Don't get too close to the page!!!!""","Being a sceptical logically minded person of a catholic upbringing I have recently opened up my mind to new religions and faiths, in order to find the right one for me or to take the best of a few. This is why i bought this book. At first the story of the author drew me in and I began to listen to the lessons that were being tought. However over time I found the book disturbing in the way it led from offering points of view and describing what was believed right by the different buddhist faiths to force feeding the reader with what's right and wrong, and which path is ideally followed.Overall I was dissapointed with how the book was written but I still learnt alot about the buddhist faith, I just think we should follow our faith in our own way, a non uniformist buddhist way is, i believe, what the future needs."
1,Macdonalds of Dzogchen,"perhaps impressive to those new to Dharma-this is in the opinion of many older students a rather trivial watered down approach to a subject of great depth and subtle distinctions.For a general introduction Sogyal Rinpoche's Tibetan Book of Living and dying is a far better place to start,and there are many books on this subject that will provide better longerlasting nutrition than this Dharma fast food approach.Also the numerous unsavory stories about the author,surya das,make this book even less appealing"
5,AWAKENING THE BUDDA WITHIN,This is an excellent book... very well written & understandable for even those who are not familiar with eastern religions or beliefs. I definitely recommend this book to any spiritual seeker.
5,Excellent book!,"The author writes in a way that makes it seem like I have known him for years. He mixes in his personal accounts of traveling the world, his personal history, and his discovery and practice of buddhism, but the message still comes through clearly and gently. It is really well done!"
4,"A book everyone should read on the ""forgotten holocaust""","I am writing this in response to those who have criticized Iris Chang's book regarding her lack of literary style, typos, lack of depth, etc. Give Ms. Chang some credit for her daring expose of which no one, until she decided to, go and spend countless hours of research and due diligence to put together this ""summary"" of the Japanese cruelties to the Chinese in Nanjing, and the rest of Asia during WW II. (Not to mention also the fact that thousands of Filipinos also suffered tremendously in the hands of Japanese troops, as well.) The book may not be a literary masterpiece, but it brought a much needed awareness and attention to the world, the ""forgotten sufferings"" of all the people that survived as well as those who died under Japanese inhumanity of that time period. Let's not criticize the book for style or grammar or lack of depth, but praise her work as a good non-fiction summary of the ignored chapter of WW II. Virginia de Dios"
4,A well written and readable book.,"I wish all histroy books were written like this one. The Rape of Nanking presented the facts and human dimension of a horrible event, without the over analysis of many other books. So many books by self appointed ""serious"" writers are packed with the writer's grand opinions in the early chapters that I either get bored or get stuck in the useless details. Ms. Chang give her well researched book logical sequence, economy of words, human drama, and thoughtful analysis. Agian, well written and highly readable work."
5,Absolutely True!!!,"I really do not understand why most of the Japanese are still trying to lie after nearly 60 years....What Japanese did during WW2 was horrible....Launch a war without declaration, killing civilians and POWs...Dammmn, I would treat Japanese as animals..."
2,Overrated because of topic.,"To be honest, this book is severely overrated because others want to comment on the incident and the importance of bringing it up, rather than the actual merits of the book. I was very dissappointed. The toning down of the incidents through 'telling' not 'showing' provides literature newspaper dry. To fully personalize the incidents, Ms. Chang needed to introduce the individuals in a less distant manner. That would have true impact. You need to care about the people in the book. ""A woman."" or even a named individual without presenting a person as more than words is needed to present such material to the public."
5,Let the world know what Japanese did in WorldWar II to China,"Compared to Jew, Chinese didn't let the world know what she suffered during World War II, especially what the Japanese didin China. As a Chinese, I fell really sorry for that! Iris Changis good not only that she stand up speak the truth but she letmore people know the tragedy. Now she is dead. But her works willgo on!."
4,A Dramatic Account,"Iris Chang has done a good job of relating the Japanese atrocities in China. Her writing style is none too fluid, but the content is so dramatic that it really doesn't matter. It made me want to explore this subject further."
3,THE RAPE OF NANKING,I was horrified to see the devastation the Japanese caused in this city. Graphic details and almost too much information. The pictures told a terrifying tale!
5,An eye opener...,"As a modern history student I thought that I knew a great deal about history and WWII in particular. I was shocked to read about the atrocities that occurred in the city of Nanking. Iris Chang's book is one of the first major attempts to uncover and understand what happened in Nanking. Her book is hard to put down as she takes the reader, first through eyewitness accounts, and then through her own analysis of why the massacre happened and who has played a role in the cover up. This book is telling on the actual massacre, as well as the Japanese mindset regarding their role in WWII atrocities."
3,It's good; more scholarly oomph would help,"This history shed new light for me on a sad story of brutality on which I was under-informed. I will let others debate the controversies; I found myself persuaded by the author. I have a few small criticisms to this otherwise fine study. First, I prefer my history more dispassionate; the author is emotionally involved in her study, though not in a way which was fatal to her thesis. Second, the book has the flavor of an excellent undergraduate senior thesis which has been expanded into a book. It lacks the scholarly gravitas of an experienced historian, e.g. James McPherson, who does a better job framing his subjects within larger historical currents. But asking the author to work at McPherson's level is a tall order. For the early work of a young author for a general audience, it is unusually good. For the interested general reader, Chang's book can be read quickly and should be."
1,"Now I understand ,,,","Reading Miguel B. Llora's review, now I understand the reason why America accused this China's forged crime and took it into the court of Tokyo Trial.America intended to offset her crime of dropping atomic bombs by producing ""Nanking Massacre"".Americans, do you know 100,000 civilians were killed by US air raid on Tokyo Mar10 1945? 100,000 civilians were killed in 2 and half hours!America has made the air raids on over 100 Japanese cities and continued killing civilians up to 500,000. The most famous ones happened in August. The US atomic bombs killed 140,000 civilians in Hiroshima and 70,000 civilians in Nagasaki.Do you know 200,000 Japanese women were raped by Americans in their occupation of Japan after WW2? Don't forget, never!"
1,Fallacy in the Name of Hitory,"This American (if this human being is an American) has not been taught the truth. The world is full of fads and fallacies and doesn't know it. The Rape of Nanking is your new clothes. You do not know your own Holocaust and frown on other nation's crime even if it is a fabricated one.Chinese Nationalist Party started co-operation with Chinese Communist Party on anti-Japanese propaganda in 1937. They recruited eye-witnesses of ""Nanking Masscre"" for the preparation of International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), but very few applicants appeared and many people were quiet or even denied the massacre.I was taught a lie? No, this article appears in Chinese documentation reported to the court of IMTFE."
1,Typical Anti-Japan Japanese,"Now we have seen how the Communism can make people vulgar by reading ""Truth Speaker""'s review. This persun could not make any refutation but only string together all sorts of flowery words.I recommed all of you to search ""Tongzhou Incident"" by any search engine then you will know the Chinese manner of massacre and understand Chang's description is just tracing their own history."
1,I will not cease from mental fight nor shall my sword sleep,Victor von Chen is one of the victims of Chinese propaganda. Their folklore should have been a tapestry of falsefoods deposited in 4000 years.731 unit was never accused even on Tokyo Trial which was a revenge by winners. Peace never comes as long as Chinese continue their propaganda.
4,Important and necessary,"I found that I agreed with much of what the Kirkus reviewer wrote. Personally, I would have preferred a more rigorous, scholarly account--it's not so much history as it is journalism. Having said that, I believe Chang has done a service to the memory of the victims in recounting the massacre. As a resident of Japan, I wish that this book would help to change the stance of Japanese officialdom which continues to downplay and deny its role as a wartime aggressor. Every August, we are reminded by the Japanese media how horrible the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was. I agree. It would also be helpful if the Japanse media provided the same degree of coverage every December to remind us of the horrors that were visited upon the people of Nanking in the winter of 1937."
5,This is a book that should be read by everyone!!,I was appalled to learn about the atrocities done to the Chinese. This book was very well written. It held my attention the whole way through. It showed me facts that should have been brought to our attention long ago. I have a much greater understanding of the Chinese and a much greater respect for them because of it. It should be included in every history class. World War II was not just about the Germans and this book shows all sides to the story. It shows why the Japenese did what they did. It shows how the Chinese have coped and how the world has ignored this. All in all one of the best nonfiction books I have ever read.
4,The book is rated 4 stars on the topic alone,"This was definitely not a ""perfect"" book. Certain parts dragged and was somewhat repititious. Iris Chang took a subject that was long overdued to be recognized. I felt like a lot of facts were just thrown in. Although the descriptions were graphic and horrifying, it is extremely important to acknowledge that these events did occur. One or two misquotes or mistakes does not erase that. We should applaude the author's attempt to educate us the other horrors of WWII."
4,"God of our fathers, lest we forget","A passionate book, well presented and well written, the text nonetheless reverberates with what I interpret as the author's underlying outrage not so much that the rape of Nanking occurred -- that goes without saying -- but that events subsequent to WWII resulted in effectively hiding the atrocity from the public view. The discussion of the information available about the rape of Nanking and how political considerations militated against full public acknowledgment of the horrific event was for me the most involving portion of the book."
1,Ridiculous,The book is full of third level data which has never been autholized. Author does not know or know very well that any picture can create new stories. Purpose justified her mean.
1,This is Nothing but Propaganda.,"--Iris Chang's ""Rape of Nanking"" is a book that fails to heal but rather sears all efforts for good international relations because it prioritizes passion at the cost of basic historical facts. We cannot ignore the book's inability and refusal, as witnessed by the usage of numerous doctored photos, to differentiate between fact and war-time propaganda.--"
1,Fake picture,"If you don't know anything about Japan and Japanese, you may be brain-washed by this book. Iris Chang wrote many disgusting discriptions not based on the truth. The pictures on this book are terrible, they are fake. One of the picture shows that one tank fires small house. But you know what, this tank did not exist at this time!! Where did she get this picture? This is like a political propaganda. And wrong translation and misunderstanding of Japanese culture. She may not able to read Japanese language I think. Many Japanese don't care this book, 'cause it looks bad, cheap joke. You need to know the truth, and you never know the truth from this book."
1,The Worst Book in the World Ever!,"Chang's book has over 90 historically incorrect articles.Chang's arguments are based on the documents with no evidence.Chang has neglected the facts contradicting ""Nanking Massacre"".Before Japan's occupation, the population in Nanking was 200,000, and it increased to 250,000 after Chinese troops retreated while editorial reviews are following Chang's lie of 350,000 massacre."
1,Twisted chinese in denial occupied this board,"Too bad there are countless evidences including hundreds of pictures. These inhumane, sadistic beings deserve much more than two nukes.""The Rape of Tibet"" is NOT a Holocaust!"
1,An Independent View,"This book by Iris Chang is indeed mostly chinese propaganda. The Chinese have a vested interest in blaming the Japanese of atrocities so as to 1) hide the atrocities committed during their own civil war and ""Cultural Revolution"", and 2) extracting monetary payments from the Japanese government, as they in fact have been doing for the last 30 years.Note that it is easy to see that the photographs in this book have all clearly been doctored (I have seen the original versions of these photos in war books with different captions, and you can see where they have been edited here).Now, that does not mean that a massacre did not take place in Nanking in 1937 (although it seems that not only the Japanese but the chinese nationalists were also involved). But if you want the truth, this book is not the best way to find it."
1,really slanted,"Iris Chang presents a distorted history of the Rape of Nanking, really just a rant against Japan. Not at all factual."
1,Malicious hoax,"Several historians, Western and Japanese historians who exhaustedly collected evidence related to Nanking, disputed her book with facts and figures, and battle reports from IJA from division commanders down to lowly privates. If you REALLY want to know the truth, read The Nanking Massacre: Fact Versus Fiction.How can the IJA ""murdered 300,000 Chinese in Nanking"" when Chinese census from late 1937 had the population numbered around 281,000? According to the Japanese scouts weeks before the seige, they reported mass exodus of Chinese population from the city, a reporter from Chicago Times who was in Nanking Safety Zone also confirmed.Rape of Nanking's purpose was to stoke Chinese ultra-nationalism and to force the Japanese government to apologize.From historical perspective, the book is pure fabrication."
1,Fiction in the Rape of Nanking,"--Iris Chang: ""More than 260,000 noncombatants died, ...well over 350,000...a few statistics must be used to give the reader an idea of the scale of the massacre...the killing was concentrated within a few weeks."" (pp.4~5, Penguin paperback edition)Basic question: ""How can 260,000 to over 350,000 noncombatants be killed in a city of 200,000, which increased to 250,000 a month later, right after all 'the killing' supposedly take place?"" :--"
5,This book reflects the fact correctly and NOBODY can pass it,"The author has passed away but the bood she wrote is the best I ever read in my life. When Japanese want to obliterate the history of this period, the book carries out a supportive materials to show this unforgottable Holocaust, which definitely was made by Japanese fascist. The fact cannot be written out. So, it is an excellent work for us. We, all of human being, should remember this history and Japanese should self-question yourself and your behavior."
2,Interesting Sino-centric description of events,"The author is a journalist, but no historian. The chronology of events listed and the dates are in disagreement with many other histories, including the 'official' accounts given by the KMT government. This book is written to evoke great amounts of emotion, but begins to show many weaknesses when viewed by those with any historical knowledge. This is a good book to add to a collection of works about WWII history, but the reader should definitely read other accounts in order to not be sucked in by the inaccuracies and sensational journalism in Chang's portrayal of a historical event. Just as one does not rely solely upon the National Enquirer to learn about the news, one should not take this book's version of history at face value. The book, ""When Tigers Fight"" give a better account of events during this part of World War II and is recommended for further reading."
4,History repeates it's se,"We still have people who think this did not happen, just the way some feel the Holocaust did not happen. Well written."
1,Full of Flaws,"Over 90 incorrect, or at least nonsense, descriptions are found in this book. This is proving Iris Chang has written this book based not on her own research but on materials provided by some (probably malicious) persons or parties (they must be sponsored by Chinese Communist Party). One more possibility is she was simply incapable of writing history."
1,Ignorance is guilty.,"A reader from CA, USA may not know the American history textbook on WW2 is different from the rest of the world. Also this person may not know every nation's history textbook is different from the rest of the world and Japanese history textbook on WW2 is very similar to American's because America had overwritten Japanese history and censored every media. Even private letters had been censored.How can we know what we believe is the truth is really truth? Freedom of speech requires skepticism and criticism for keeping ourselves from being deceived."
1,Every article in this book is,"lie. My parents are chinese and I don't like Japan but this book is terrible. For example, the photo of necks is widely believed to be taken in Manchuria and they are thieves that slaughtered many people in Manchuria. A photo of abandoned in ruin has another one taken at the same time. It shows his parent and (his brother?) put the baby in the ruin for the problem photo to show barbarism of Japan Army. There are more but it takes long time to type and I don't want to waste my important time. Anyway, this book is not worth reading."
1,Repetitive and sophomoric,"The topic was interesting. I knew very little about the China-Japan part of WWII. That such horrific occurance has gone under-reported is really a crime. But this book is, sadly, kind of boring. It is also very repetitive, as though the story could have been a short news artiicle or series of articles. (A magazine article). Too bad this had to be expanded to make it appear book-size. If you buy a hard-copy, the font of the print is large and the margins are wide. May have made a passable graduate thesis."
5,Landmark History of Warcrimes in the Pacific War,Iris Chang has done the world a tremendous service by carefully documenting the accounts of those who witnessed the slaughter of POW's and noncombatants in China by the Imperial Japanese Army. Her candor and her compassion are remarkable as she recounts the most horrific details. This book is very difficult to endure. Yet it should be essential reading for high school students and soldiers of all nations if for no other reason than its ability to make one painfully aware of the ravages of war.
4,Excellent read,An excellent book on a much under studied/reported part of WWII. Well resourced and documented. Provides great insight into one of the darkest atrocities of the Pacific Theater.
5,What a Tragedy,"I could not believe what I was reading, a horrific story of just how bad the human race can be. I honestly had never heard of Nanking and I've read several books on WWII. This book is graphic in its detail of just how badly the Chinese people, women in particular, we treated. I found it difficult to put the book down and would certainly recommend it."
5,Rekishi o obenasai,(We must remember history) I found I was able to connect with the passion that Chang infused the book with. Kudos to her for brining us up to speed because as present day peoples we have a terrible case of amnesia. We would be very lucky if someone did a similar expose on the egregious and obscene human rights violations by our foundling (Sic.) fathers
3,20th century Asian history,"This was truly eye-opening b/c of the lack of awareness that this event ever occured. That is the point and the double-tragedy of what happened. Much like the Nazi atrocities of WW2, it is hard to believe that man could act in such a way to others. The book is informative yet somewhat repetitive. A couple of times I swear I was reading word for word what I had already read. Otherwise, it was very interesting."
3,Well Documented - Why do Japanese continue to deny?,"Human beings are capable of such evil. It really is quite sad. I thought Ms. Chang's account was well documented and written.Unfortunately, the Japanese still live in a world of denial. I just read the following in the South China Morning Post (one of Hong Kong's English-language newspapers): <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<NEWS BRIEF>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Book's aborted launch hailedA Tokyo-based newspaper yesterday welcomed the aborted launch of a Japanese translation of Chinese-American Iris Chang's bestseller The Rape of Nanking.The Sankei Shimbun said: ""With the stoppage of the publication, we can avoid a situation in which Japanese are left puzzled by wrong historical remarks."" The book is an account of Japan's wartime atrocities in Nanjing.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<end NEWS BRIEF>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Hopefully, more books like The Rape of Nanking will enlighten the world community and slowly filter into the Japanese conscience."
2,Overhelming .. But carefull,"I read the book within 48h, it iswell written indeed, the autor is a talented journalist.. BUT she's not historian furthermore her close link to the tragedy (it was a tragedy) arouse questions. After some research, I discover that several aspect of the books, and not only details were if not false, but incorrect, inexact, and biaised. Imperial Japan (like Nazi Germany)did bad, really bad things. Those crimes must undestand and prevented to happen again. But Japan (a democracy) like the German Republic are different now and can't be judged on those past actions. The book unfortunalty doesn't give me this impression. World is not black and white, Japan is a democracy, but I agree that some effort must be made for the apology; China is a dictature responsible for the death of millions of their own people. Fact should be the only source of that kind of books, not hanger."
2,Sooooo Disappointing!,"As an avid reader of both military history and Chinese history, I had high expectations for this book...too high. My biggest complaint is that for all the gruesome details and stories of horror, Ms. Chang makes little attempt to explain why the Japanese soldiers acted as they did, and why the Chinese soldiers and civilians reacted as they did. Only briefly is this subject touched upon in chapter 2 and in the epilogue. For all the research, surely she must have some impression or opinion on why the atrocities took place. After reading ten pages on how to rape a child, I'd hope for more than a two paragraph explanation of why. Very frustrating! It's too bad a military historian did not tackle the subject - provide some insight into the 'how' and 'why'.P.S. Compulsory reading for anybody interested in China/int'l politics/etc. is Nathan and Ross 'The Great Wall and the Empty Fortress'. Also, for anybody who's lived in China: 'China Awakes'."
5,Japanese must read this book.,"As I know Japanese Government still says that there was no holocaust happened in Nanking. Besides, the education department eliminates such history from their textbook and not allow the Japanese youth know the correct one. I'm so angry about that."
2,Not the right book to start...,"As mentioned in a few reviews before mine, this book is severely flawed in more than one place. Only because it's written well doesn't mean that everything in there is right. Anyone who's interested in the Nanjing Massacre should maybe start with the book ""The Nanjing Massacre"" by Honda Katsuichi, which gives a much less biased view on what happened and offering many stories from survivors of the massacre and the events that occured from the landing at Shanghai to the fall of Nanjing. I do think that it's good that Iris Changs book has become so popular and made many people interested in this topic, but one should really get the facts right in such a work and that is something which she did not do."
1,Style over Substance,"Iris Chang seems to have set out to capture the Rape of Nanking in an objective fashion in her ""Rape of Nanking."" Instead we get an unbelievably flawed book. From facts and sources that are made up to doctored photographs, Chang plays with the reader's emotions. Don't be fooled, to hear Chang tell it is to have it lose its importance amongst unrepresentative anecdotes and uncited details."
1,It's completely fabrication.,"I can not understand at all why this book has become one of the best-sold books in U.S. One of the reasons is the information in here is extremely unreliable and lack of authenticity. I know many of them have already reveled to be forgery. For instance, the author cited the stories told by Mr. Azuma, the Japanese ex-soldier. But it is already known that his story about this incident was revealed to be his fiction. I also found all the photos listed here were not reliable. I want to insist that this book is filled with vicious forgery."
1,Flawed as a work of history,"While Chang emotionally insists that Japanese teachers don't teach children about Nanking or most Japanese don't know about this issue, as a foreigner who actually spent many years in school in that country, I can clearly say that is not true at all. ALL the Japanese know and learn about Nanking and other war crimes.Also, it is very clear that so many historical details are flawed and so many pictures are decoyed or forged in her book. But if you can not investigate into the current Japan, which you can do so easily with so many databases and other sources, how could you qualify your investigation into something that happened more than 60 years ago?I don't think Iris Chang was incapble of research. I'm afraid that she simply had no intention to pursue the truth of the history."
1,Totally disagree,I don't want to believe the american read the book of this kind and believe it easily. I wish they are only want to blame the highly developped country of different race by reading F class book.My parents are chinese too and I know photographs in this book are not true. Most of them were propaganda of communism china to disgrace Japan to unite so many people who speak different languages in their own country. Actually communism china (and North and south Korea) still asks Japan to pay for these fake crimes. Their purpose is to turn Japan to communism country and control highly educated and developped country as they want.I strongly believe this Iris Chang is sponcered by communism china. You will lose intelligence if you believe this book.This book is toooo bad for intelligent people in the united states and will give bad influence to relationship between Japan.
1,Wake up!,I cannot imagine why so many people believe this kind of bulls--t.We should always remember that a huge number of Chinese killed by Chienese Communist Party.They have to make a story up for diverting people's complaint.Japan is always the best target for them.They don't take objections much.Some Japanese even gradly accept it and throw themselves at a Chinese feet.This kind of hypocrites maybe regard themselves as better person by doing that.Iris Chang is a big liar but I don't brame her.She is working very hard for her country.
1,Here is an evidence,"In fact, the people now living in Tibet are mostly from other regions in China, there are very few native Tibet'ers left after that horrible incident."
1,Documenting history -,"It is not surprising that there are divergent perspectives on a historical event - particularly something as chaotic as a full-scale battle that the Sino-Japanese War was. I think it is important not to use history to vent one's raw hatred and/or to advance one's political agenda - whatever that might happen to be. In such an effort, a bitter battle in a war can become a ""holocaust"", and frontline brothels ""rape camps"". Many history books have aided the reconciliation of former foes. This book does not seem to be one of them."
1,Unfortunately full of flows and mistakes,"As for numbers murdered and raped in Nanking, Iris Chang spends so much time establishing an extraordinarily high figure with little evidence .Although Chang refers to John Rabe's testimony for alleged Japanese Army's brutality, she never accept or even pay attention to the fact that he clearly mentioned, in his letter to Hitler in June 1938, estimated number of civilian killed was between 50,000 to 60,000.A little investigaton showed me that Miner Searle Bates, a member of the International Safety Zone Committee for Nanking, recorded that estimated number killed was around 12,000 as reported to Tokyo Trial later. Also, Ku-Wei Chun mentioned 20,000 citizens were killed in his speech to the League of Nations on Feburary 2, 1938.Anyway, some people may argue that the number of victim doesn't matter so much. But since Iris Chang herself put so much emphasis on this issue, she shoud have been fairer and provided readers with more data."
5,Mis-education of Americans,"The problem with this whole era of history is the fact that we (as American's) are to centered on events that transpired in Europe as opposed to in the Asia/Pacific Region. Our only real knowledge of the Pacific War is of Pearl Harbor and the dropping of the A-bomb's on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with some knowing of the events in the Philippines and Iwo Jima. It is really sad that the Pacific War is still taking a backseat to the European War. People need to understand that not only 6 million Jews died during the Holocaust, but tens of millions all over the world, of all different races, colors, nationalities, and religions."
5,Atrocities uncovered,"Chang's book is truly enlightening. As the daughter of a Korean mother who was raised under the Japanese occupation, I heard for many years of the brutality of the Japanese army as inflicted upon Chinese, Koreans and Filipinos. After reading this book, my mother's horror stories were confirmed. I too remember reading about this incident in school (one line of a history book!) and i often wondered about it. I am glad that Ms. Chang wrote this book and I hope others will find the book as interesting as I did."
4,The other holocaust,"Ms. Chang writes a vivid depiction of the forgotten World War II holocaust. She pulled no punches describing some of the more gruesome atrocities perpetrated by the occupying Japanese including a ""game"" where the Japanese soldiers would throw babies into the air and attempt to ""catch"" them on the end of a spear. The book reminded me that war crimes committed by those of non-European descent (think Africa and Asia) are often ignored by the world community and are more easily ""swept under the carpet"". The fact that the author is a Chinese woman gives the book more power and credibility."
3,A little too demanding.,"Well written book with shocking subject matter, that is informative and easy to read. I would give it 4 stars, but Ms. Chang too often brings up the subject of why there was not a big hollywood production, and volumes of books written about the nanking incident. This gets annoying after a while, but besides that, it's a good read."
2,This tale lacks cohesion.,"I must concur with many of the reviewers who found fault with TRoN; Chang's book not only lacks proper pacing and flow, it's greatest fault lies in the educated reader's feeling that some of the facts are not sufficiently substantiated. As a high school teacher I have read essays from students who have structured their points of view more coherently than she has. Most often, the events are presented in a jumbled and haphazzard manner, as if Chang is piecing together a collection of war horror stories rather than weaving the facts into a story. It was obvious from the start that the selling point of her novel was the sensationalistic and provoking title and subject matter, not necessarily the way in which the material was presented. Better, less impassioned writers will do a superior job with the material in the future."
2,"A Superficial, Journalistic Account","This is a journalistic account, which is superficial and very biased. Chang seems to feel that getting the ""historical scoop"" by writing on this neglected subject is more important than providing in-depth analysis. Organization and style are poor. This is essentially a collection of second-hand anecdotes, strung together in loose order. This book was somewhat interesting to read, but it does not fully engage the reader's interest. Very little order of battle on Japanese units involved, which makes it difficult to determine who actually committed these atrocities. Two maps. Note that many other reviewers appear gripped with this book on an emotional level, as any tragedy brought to life can be, but it is not history."
5,emotional roller coaster,"This book being the first novel written in english that documents the atrocities committeed by the Japanese in the city of Nanking has done a magnificent job in exposing the American Public to the ""forgotten Holocaust"" in Asia. Everyone knows about the Holocaust or Schindler, but most have no idea what Nanking is or who Rabe is. Many claim there are mistakes in the book, dates and facts that can be disproven, but the words of the survivors who witnessed the murder of their own family and who lived through gang rape can never be disputed, because those scars, emotional and physical, will always remain. And the words of the former Japanese soldiers who have admitted and regretted their sins will always be in the archives. This is a rewarding book that will be read for generations, and now the world will finally learn of what really happened, the atrocities, the attempts of the Japanese government to cover up and deny their wrongdoings even today."
5,The worst nightmare the world has forgotten.,"It's shocking and sad that very few people know about one of the worst massacre(involving massive rapes) in the history. Although flooding amount of evidences and witness, Japanese government never admits it as a massacre, in fact, they call it ""incident"" and mention with about 1 sentence in their history book. The fact that US and Japan became the strongest allies after WW2 and US need them to suppress the power of China didn't allow the worst war crimes done by Japan to be revealed. Taft-Katsura Agreement also played a large roll on discouraging the dirty secret to be revealed to the world. It also has a lot to do with lack of criticism of Japanese media that's traditionally known as ""story tellers"" rather than public watchers."
5,History should be remembered,"This is a very good book which states an undeniable horrible crime committed by jap troops fully supported by their crazy people. they are not only without any humanity, but also coward, even afraid of face the truth, tried to deny it again and again. but truth is truth, no one can cover it, and we will forever remember that horrible december in the mid 1930, remember all the inocent victoms."
5,A reminder of the forgotten war crime against the mankind,Excellent book - It tells some of the saddest and most horrible war crimes during World War II committed by the Imperial Japanese military. The sad true is that Japanese government still has not offically apoloized to the Aisa countries for its war crime. I highly recommend this book for everyone and hopefully history would not repeat itself.
4,Forgotten,"I will admit that I am only a Grade 12 student reading this book as part of a English project, however while reading the reviews of this book on Amazon.com I came across somebody saying that this is not forgotten history. When I presented my report to a class of average Canadian high school students many of whom were in my History 12 class were totally oblivious to such acts of violence and sadistic rape,murder and degredgation of the Chinese. I believe that however bias Chang's writing maybe at certain points it is only because any decent human being cannot or would have a hard time writing of such atrocities without providing a hint of anger and frustration as to the events of Nanking. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYBODY, it is very much a book that is important and informative, but at the same time it is written with graphic detail as the reader is bombarded with constant stories and depictions of rape,murder and mutilation."
2,A GOOD START,"I RATE THIS A 2 STARS, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MAKE ME TO BELIVE EVERYTING IT WAS TRYING TO TELL ME, I AM NOT SAYING THEY WEREN'T TRUE, I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY IF I WAS A JAPANESE PERSON, I WON'T BE CONVINCED BY THIS BOOK. IF THIS BOOK COULD CONVINCE MANY JAPANESE, THEN I WOULD RATE THIS BOOK A 5 STARS. HOWEVER I THINK THIS BOOK WAS A GOOD START IN THIS TOPIC. IT IS WORTH SOME ATTENTION"
2,Polemic posing as history,"I found this book unsatisfactory: it does not always substantiate its claims; it misrepresents certain facts, either deliberately or as a result of an excess of enthusiasm; and, in some instances, it relies on some evidence that has been shown to be fabricated. The saddest part about the emotionally-charged responses to this book is that so many people seem willing to insist on history AS THEY WISH IT TO BE, rather than as a fair reflection of verifiable facts.There is irrefutable evidence of large-scale Japanese atrocities in China, including in Nanjing. Their probable scale and the motivations for the actions of those involved are discussed in many reputable history books. Iris Chang's volume, however, does not contribute much to our understanding; its main effect has been to comfort existing prejudices, on both sides of the controversy, and fuel a lot of ugly and irrational commentary."
3,"Also, read ""The Chinese in America: A Narrative History"".","Authors did very good jobs. Japanese should read this book. And also American have to read her another book, ""The Chinese in America: A Narrative History"". Chinese are the most tragic people in the world. Both Japanese and American should feel apologetic for their brutal behavior to Chinese."
2,problematic but historiographically important,"Chang's book, from a historical perspective, is full of errors, which the revisionists have used to their delight to claim the atrocity is fake. It is not, but her book is a very mixed blessing and she did not do a good historical job. Her book is still important and deserves mention for 2 historiographical reasons: 1) Her book single handedly gave the incident a new life in the eyes of the overseas Chinese community and the Western world at large. This has glavanized researchers and produced more work on the issue. 2) Her book uses the Rabe diaries which has moved the research forward. Her effective use of the Rabe account, which I seem to recall her finding (?) is very important."
5,Japanese lies can't hide the truth.,"This is a great and courageous work that tells it like it was. Whatever ludicrous and vicious lies the Japanese may tell to distort the truth and no matter how hard they try to attack this book, there's no escaping from the truth."
5,"This book is fascinating, shocking, and informative.","Iris Chang spares no small detail in her account of the Japanese invasion of Nanking. The atrocities committed by the Japanese soldiers in 1937 are disgusting and truly evil. That Japan still denies the truth about their barbaric behavior says something about their morals and code of ethics. This book is even more deserving of being made a film than Schindler's List. The brave Americans and Europeans who created the Nanking Safety Zone saved way more lives than Schindler ever dreamed of. Chang is 100% correct in her assessment that the Japanese were the perpetrators of World War II, not the victims, as they claim to be. If you are interested in history, pick up this book today!"
4,Good coverage of little covered story for you WWII buffs.,"A very good book for those interested in another perspective of WWII, that of the occupied Chinese. Ms.Chang presents a well written and well documented account of the occupation of Nanking by the Japanese Army. It can be a little graphic (to warn those sensitive ones out there), but to understand what the people of Nanking went through it must be graphic. We always hear about the war from the US, the European, and even the Japanese view. This book opens a new perspective that's worth exploring."
1,It's completely fabrication,"I can not understand at all why this book has become one of the best-sold books in U.S. One of the reasons is the information in here is extremely unreliable and lack of authenticity. I know many of them have already reveled to be forgery. For instance, the author cited the stories told by Mr. Azuma, the Japanese ex-soldier. But it is already known that his story about this incident was revealed to be his fiction. I also found all the photos listed here were not reliable. I want to insist that this book is filled with vicious forgery."
1,The Rape of Nankin,"This book is very terrible. Most of hisorians prove these events were not true. She just only troubled unintellectual persons. I am Japanese and,Iwould like to accept only the truth. However, her book is almost wrong. If she criticize Japan, Chaina should accept Tibet massacre. If China don't , she should not have rights to criticize Japan"
3,Racism,"Especially to Chinese people,As a Japanese, I am in a deep shock after reading so many extremely offensive comments against ""general"" Japanese.Have these people who hate Japanese witnessed the holocaust by themselves? Do they at least have a connection to the victims? Do they hate any Japanese people in front of them even if they have nothing to do with the war?Do they know that this unfounded hatred against a specific race is nothing but racism and nothing different from what the Japanese soldiers used for an excuse to kill Chinese people in those days?I would not argue the credability of the content of this book nor agree with the Japanese government's attitude to the history problems.The only thing I can say is that we have to stop the cycle of hatred. The hatred does not make us move forward. All these offensive comments reminded me of my terrible memories with some of my Chinese friends, at least thost who I believed are my friends."
2,Re-creating history - Chinese way,"There seems little doubt that far too many Chinese civilians were unnecessarily killed in Nanjing during WWII.To say that this was a ""holocaust"" in which 300,000+ people were slaughtered smacks of Beijing's perennial propaganda campaign. The communist regime has blackmailed Japan for decades based on this ""history"" to extract various economic handouts. Today most serious scholars around the world believe the Nanjing death toll was closer to tens of thousands and, though horrifying enough, did not come even remotely close to the scale of the European holocaust.Besides this is a claim of the government that still teaches its school children that the Korean War began as a result of an invasion by ""American imperialist devils"" and that the Chinese and North Koreans fought back ""in self-defense"".Frightening indeed."
4,Heavy stuff,"Like any book of this kind it's not a pleasant read but it is informative. For many of us older Westerners growing up in ignorance of the history which lay behind the iron and bamboo curtains, it is a reminder that no group of humans have a monopoly on attempted genocide: we'll all give it a go if the circumstances stack up.The analysis of the historical and cultural reasons behind both the massacre and the aftermath seems reasonably balanced and does not come across as overtly anti-Japanese, thereby giving it an air of reasoned argument rather than the bigoted rant that it could be.I would give it a 5 star rate but it's difficult to say you ""love"" a book about mass murder."
4,Excellent document that will disturb any reader.,"Many historians have labled the Japanese soldiers of WWII as the most bestial and brutal of any modern-era army. Their atrocities throughout the Pacific during WWII make many Nazi crimes pale in comparison, and the fact that many Japanese are still loathe to admit to the barbarism of its soldiers says a lot. Japanese schools make no mention of the Chinese slaughtered at the hands of the Japanese during WWII.This is an excellent book, well written, and deeply disturbing. Perhaps it is almost TOO graphic at some points, but that is up to the reader. Not for the timid.I see there is a sort of culture war going on here in these reviews. Ignore the China-bashing and the Japanese denials and read this for yourself. At the very least it will make you want to investigate deeper."
3,"Very informative, but lost my attention","I knew absolutely nothing about the China/Japan conflicts of WWII until I stumbled upon this book. It was extremely informative and gave a graphic description of the horrible events that took place in China. I also liked the background that the author gave regarding the China/Japan differences. Although I was into the first hundred pages, I sort of lost interest as I continued and I found myself reading other things and daydreaming. All around a good book though."
4,good single,"This is a good follow up single for ""Come into my life"". One wonders why her fame faded, because she is strong on any release. She's like the 80s Alicia Keys."
4,pleased with product,"We ordered this because our two dogs have allergies and each needed 50 Mg of diphenhydramine twice a day. I couldn't see how we could afford to keep the dogs!! I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon. It works great for them and I've started using it myself. I did feel that the shipping took longer than most of the items I order from Amazon, so I'll be sure to order replacements early."
4,"Great price, fast shipping","We use this medication for our dog, it is so much easier to buy the 50 mg capsules so we only have one pill to deal with since she has to take so many others."
4,Generic Benadryl,"This product works just as good as the brand name, Benadryl at a fraction of the price. its a Huge bottle and great price so i would definitely buy again, not anytime soon as this will last quite a while. I would also recommend."
5,Sleep tight,Great chose! Got here fast. It works fast too. See how much you know when you buy this for that major issue of a belt line.
2,"decent product, deceptive picture","Generic drugs are roughly the same across the board. Diphenhydramine is simple enough of a molecule that generic synthesis of it is predictably consistent. That said... the picture representing this produt is misleading. Pictured is Qualitest brand generic diphenhydramine. What I received is completely different: Pharbest brand generic diphenhydramine. I bought this item thinking I was buying Qualitest's version, with Qualitest being a very reputable company. I've never even heard of Pharbest. Not cool, seller. At least post a disclaimer that product may differ in brand than that pictured. Or, take a picture of the actual product and don't use a google image search to find a picture of ""1,000# diphenhydramine"". I'll avoid this seller (American Wholesale) in the future because of this deception."
3,Does this cause Drowsyness,I cannot afford to fall asleep at the desk. So I have question is: Does this stuff make you drowsy?
4,good read,"if you are interested in the real ""Willy Wonka"" chocolate factory story, this is the book.History of the M&M; Mars / Hershey interwined relationship, includes info about other candy companies as well.easy read."
5,PRAISE HIM KELLY!!!,"I purchased this CD this past weekend and I wished I had bought it the first day it came out!! Totally anointed, I've always been a fan of Kelly's and have all of her secular cd's as well. She has a powerful, spirit moving voice and I always knew she would return to her roots. I watched her do a duet with Bishop Paul Morton on BET Gospel Awards and she brought me to my feet. I love this cd and you will enjoy it too!"
2,Dissappointed,I love Kelly Price and am highly disappointed with this album. The only song I like is Get up and Praise... I wish I had only bought the single of that song.
4,A Must Have,"One morning I heard the song ""Healing"" and I had to purchase the CD. It has really blessed my life and I still listen to it, or something off of it, every day."
3,Not what I expected,"We all know that this girl can SING!!! let's say that up front, however I did not like this CD. I think I was expecting a more traditional sound from her. With the exception of Healing, I did not like any of the songs on the cd."
4,Key Marco's Buried Treasure,"I think that this was a very intersesting book for anyone who loves mystery thing. The fact of this book is it is like a buried treasure; the island it self is a treasure. This book is very strange in its way of telling the past, yet it is the same as the present. The sland is a beautiful place and the book mkes it more realistic."
4,It has wonderful ideas for weddings.,I found the book to have wonderful ideas for crafting your own wedding. As a Bridal Consultant it has given me wonderful ideas to use in the weddings that I am helping to arrange. I would highly recommend this book to other brides.
3,Lots of ideas and inspirations,"This book gives a lot of ideas for the twenty various themes it explores. Many of the crafts are very simple, and often involve embellishing purchased items (such plain garters or gloves) to fit in with the theme. Patterns are given for some of the more complicated projects, which is nice. Overall, I'd say it was a helpful book."
5,perfect pickle pincher purchase,"I purchased four pickle pinchers and gave three to friends. I love mine and so do my friends. I wish I had a dozen more, it is such a hit."
4,Pickle Picker,"The product works very well for both pickles and olives. We were told recently to never use fingers to remove olives from the jar so as to avoid getting oils mixed in. The wires on the product are by design very thin, so I have concerns how long it will last."
2,Broke upon arrival,Description was alittle misleading in saying its a set of two. upon arrival it wasbroke. I super glued it so I could use it right away which is why I ordered it in the first place. Amazon was great in making things right. The best customer service out there. I'm sure this was a mistake and I do really like the pickle pincher. I would order one again even though this one had a problem. Things happen and I'm sure it upset the seller too.
5,DELUXE PICKLE PINCHER,"great little item ... have several, use them in home and the RV and they make great little gifts.would recomend have had some of them for a few years no problems use them for olives,cherries, and many other thimgs like that."
3,ok,This product is not intended to be in used all the time. Mine starts to overheat. It is still a good price with fast delivery.
2,buzz buzz buzz,"unfortunately, I wanted to use this to power a little FM transmitter attached to our TV to bring sound to a radio closer to us.This caused sound distortion and a buzz (60 cycle) from inadequate filtering. Remembering back, this is the second adapter I tried that had too much noise.Otherwise, it had the connectors I needed, and it documented how to connect with the right polarity."
2,Causes buzzing noise...,"Don't try using it for the wireless portion of the X-Rocker Pedestal chair, the buzzing sound is really crazy..."
4,powerline,does what I need it to do...had looked all over for product like this and was about to give up and then I thought about amazon and checked and there it was and the price was right.
1,Too much RFI for Scanner Radio,"Emits too much RFI for handheld scanner device. I imagine a ferrite core around the cable would help, butthis adds to the price if you don't have some in your kit. Just tuning in NOAA and searching the local frequenciesskipped a couple, didn't happen using just the batteries. This adapter is very light compared to an older one(same size and same company) -- easy to tell that this company (Powerline) has reduced the quality on this item.Works fine on another device, but I would not use it for amateur radio gear or scanners."
1,I found this adapter worthless,"Aside from the fact that the adapter didn't actually provide power to the modem I was buying it for, the hum from this item was intolerable. In addition, the storage compartment for the additional adapters doesn't actually fit the adapters; the strip got caught causing one of the spare adapter's pins to bend. It will cost me almost as much to send it back so now I'll have to buy another one at a walk-in store."
5,Excellent AC adapter,Bought two adapters and using them on voice ID devices. The adapters work perfectly.
4,Nice piece of equipment,"Its a very nice and useful tool for operating various devices.You just need to check whether the voltage and current ranges you need are supported by this.It works out of the box and has good instruction manual.However, you can search on the net to find out more details about the signs and symbols, if you don't know them already or you are not sure."
2,"What did the bird say when it saw this adapter? ""Cheap Cheap Cheap""",The plug tip storage compartment doesnt even hold the plug tips unless you take them off the bar. And it doesn't have the USB port as described by Amazon!
5,PowerLine Response,"Unfortunately, the description for this product incorrectly states that it has a USB power port. We are trying to get Amazon to correct that. If you are in need of a universal adapter with a USB power port, try the PowerLine 0900-77 which is a 1300ma Universal Adapter with USB Power Port. It also has over twice the power capability of this adapter if you have higher demand devices to connect. If you only need USB power, then the PowerLine musicPower 0900-71 is an ideal solution and provides 2 USB power ports that can be used at the same time."
5,Just what I needed.,"I needed a power adapter for a portable CD player that I used at work w/ speakers. I wanted to get it cheaply. This fit the bill, and has worked without problems. I simply selected the voltage (which was indicated right on my player - it should be printed on most electronic items, so don't guess) and picked which plug fit."
2,Very noisy,"The price is right and it's nice that it comes with a little container to keep all the plug ends in, but..... This thing emits a ton of electrical noise. I tried to use it to power a wireless radio transmitter to a gaming chair, but the sound ends up with a buzzing noise. Batteries work fine and an AC adapter I borrowed from another appliance works fine."
1,Faulty QA Testing,"Recently bought the Power Line to power a USB Hub. As soon as I plugged it in, it SHORTED OUT! Having purchased through Amazon for year, I do not blame Amazon or the Manufacture, just some bad Quality Assurance down the line."
3,You get what you paid for,"This product works, but it's still cheap($14 shipping and handling vs. $100 at Best Buy)I've had it for two months and I'm always having to connect the female and male parts because it constantly falls off."
5,Evocative and gripping,"This is a wonderful book and a real departure from run-of-the-mill suspense novels. Griffith's writing is gorgeous and the book works well on many levels. It's not that hard to figure out whodunit--but that's not the point. The story of Aud and how she thaws to the world is the point, and is deftly told amid sensory details of Atlanta heat and Norway glaciers, and emotional details of a strong woman who doesn't know that she's stuck in a safe but lonely place within herself. I think it's a fabulous book, and Griffith just keeps getting better. Can't wait for another one!"
3,"Great language, spotty plot","I loved Griffith's _Ammonite_... beautiful rich characters, detailed setting and intricate plot. I was hoping for an equal treatment of the detective novel format. Griffith's language in _The Blue Place_ is still incredible, especially the first time Julia and Aud spar <purrr>. However, the plot development is significantly weaker, with many logical gaps and hanging threads. For example, near the beginning, she references Aud's 60-year-old handmade quilt, which no one else has ever seen. It would have been nice to at least mention it near then end as a point of loss. The bad guy (I won't mention who) isn't a clear picture, despite his importance in Aud's life.It's a good read, tho! Enjoy!"
5,"gut-wrenching, exciting, and unexpected","This is just the most amazing book: sexy, gut-wrenching, exciting, funny, unexpected, and full of stories-within-stories (like the troll fairytale) and things that'll make you think. While I was reading I believed in Aud. I was with her on that glacier fighting for her life. Unbelievably exciting. And at the same time I could smell the ice, hear the birds. I don't know how the author did all that at once..What surprised me about this novel was the sly sense of humor. It's different, sort of foreign, but it flicks out and gets you when you're not expecting it and lets you know Aud is smart as well as fast and frightening.This is a great book. If only Aud was real."
4,Good Read,"I enjoyed this book. Unfortunately I read the sequel 'Always' before I read this one so I was aware of the ending beforehand. Too bad this book wasn't written with the depth 'Always' was but still it was interesting, particularly how the main character Aud discussed her Norwegian roots through troll symbology. Aud is a rock for a reason notwithstanding her emotionally isolated upbringing."
3,"Interesting, but extremely predictable","I found Nicola Griffith's book(first one I've read by her) interesting factually, but many times bogged down in flowery prose and unrealistic dialogue. I knew not long after Aud met Julia exactly how it would turn out and knew the identity of the criminal way before Aud did. If we were supposed to be surprised by the ending, it was a huge disappointment."
2,"A non-thrilling disappointment follows ""Slow River""","The subtitle is ""A Novel of Suspense,"" but that is simply false advertising. The key betrayal is easily spotted early on; the plot itself is hackneyed and dull. It mainly provides a context for the heroine ""Aud"" to wreak painful revenge on a series of anonymous males. All the males in ""The Blue Place"" are weak, craven, venal or incompetent. Most of the females are strong, wise or honorable, and none more so than Aud. She is a multisegmented character whose many aspects are revealed sequentially: ex-cop, dyke, carpenter, warrior, gardener, Norwegian daughter of privilege.Yet for all the detail, Aud is a smug superhero who fights, parties and putters in an unending state of peak sensuality. It is impossible to empathize with her as she maneuvers professionally through various scenarios; her final ""humanization"" is sketchy and unconvincing. Griffith has squandered her talent on this detached and uninvolving power fantasy."
1,BORING...........,"I'm sorry but this book went nowhere. It was dull, the characters were hard to decipher and the story line was confusing. I liked Aud but the author's writing style just could not keep my interest. She created a fascinating character in Aud but for some reason she let her get lost in whatever mystery she was trying to create. This was one dull, boring book."
1,Psychopath Lady Cop on the Loose!,Excuse me? Would blood-lusting Aud get past the psychological assessments of the police force? Since she did I assume this book is a critique of the Atlanta police unit!A Xena type fantasy set in Norway and Atlanta.
4,difficult to put down,"I liked this book a great deal. Ms Griffith's literary style brought me to such lovely places with her metaphors and ability to feel the scene rather than dance around the descriptive words. Her main character, Aud, lives in all of us .I'm looking forward to reading her again."
5,Pleasantly surprised by Ostler,"I had the pleasure in 2005 of watching Mr. Ostler give a presentation on a PBS channel about Empires of the Word. At the time I thought his presentation was disjointed and he came off as somewhat condescending toward his audience. But, after reading his book, I completely changed my mind. Empire of the Word is well-researched and its scope is wide. It deals with more than just language, although languages are its main theme. The book is very readable and for anyone interested in language, linguistics and history, I would recommend it as a ""must"" read."
2,"Fascinating topic, but dry and poorly organized","I am hesitant to post this review for fear of being accused of lack of intelligence (as has already happened to several reviewers here), but here goes. I am surprised to find myself saying that I found this book dry and unreadable---I have a background in linguistics and history and a passion for the topic of language change. But there was too much jumping back and forth across topics within chapters and too much rather dull historical minutiae. As much as I wanted to take in the many gems within this book, it wasn't worth plodding through the dull majority of the text."
3,"should be ""A Language history of the WEST""","first of all, i admit that it is a magnificent book with decent introduction to Western language history, and i did learn a lot from this book. however, when it talks about eastern part of the WORLD, the author just shows his lack of basic knowledge and even some writing from wiki is better than this."
2,"Poorly written, uninvolving rattling off of unexplained names","A dip into practically any page will yield passages that list exotica, for example page 348 (""must have spoken Paya, Miskitu, Guamimi and Kuna""). This kind of dense unexplained information throughout the book seems to have dazzled the other reviewers here or, rather, beaten them into some kind of admiration. It left me cold, and more than little resentful that such a fascinating subject as the grown and demise of languages over time should be handled in such a dull shallow manner."
1,Poor Kindle version,"The one star is for the Kindle version.I bought the Kindle version of Empires of the Word after preordering and waiting several months for the release. That was a mistake. The Kindle version is poorly prepared. Not only are all the maps absent, but many tables and quotes are missing. For example, the table comparing counting from one to ten in the three major Semitic languages is absent. The footnotes, as usual for Kindle, are difficult to follow. Some footnotes seem to be lumped together at the end of chapters.I gave up on the Kindle version and bought the paperback. Much better! This book is an excellent history of language. Unfortunately, the conversion to Kindle was sloppy. I am usually a big Kindle fan, but in this case Kindle turned an informative, enjoyable book into mush."
5,Marvellous,"I started reading it out of curiosity, never suspecting how rich the views offered by Ostler are. Some of the insights are, if not ascertainable, impressive."
3,Ambitious but inaccurate,"The treatment of south asian history is firmly within the colonial eurocentric mould. No mention is made of the surrounding controversy for the accepted historical arguments. That said, the later development and spread of sanskrit to south east asia and beyond is a good story educating the lay reader. The development and spread of dravidian branch and african languages have been ignored. This book could have been written 50 years ago for there is no new understanding in it that justifies its current publication."
2,Boring!,this book is really boring I bought it for a class and I totally hate reading it. I'm half way through and I'm only on ch.5! The chapters are soooooooooo!!!! long! its riddiculous! this is a pretty thick book and it has really small writting! The author just talks over and over again about the same thing! Don't recommend it to read just for fun but if it is for a class then goodluck!
1,Like a text book,"I have a large interest in this subject, but the book was like a text book to me, instead of a story teller. Could just be me."
2,Kindle has trouble showing non-Roman text!,"I bought this book in Kindle format. On my Kindle keyboard, and on my iPad's Kindle Reader, the text is often unreadable. The trouble is with unusual characters. They can be much reduced in size, compared to the adjacent Roman letters, and possibly distorted. So, they are tough or impossible to read. In contrast, Amazon's ""Look Inside the Book"" preview shows the text clearly. (Kindle renders some non-Roman text perfectly, such as Cyrillic. It is not all awful.)Hence, if you would want to see clearly text in non-Roman symbols (and there are a lot of examples like that), then I recommend buying a paper copy.Dick"
3,Lord of the Nutcracker Men Review,"Lord of the Nutcracker Men was an enjoyable book that one can read in an afternoon. The book is set in the early onset of Worl War I in England. It revolves around a young boy and his army of nutcracker men. He fights the battles with his nutcracker men while his father fights the real battles on the battlefield. The battles that are fought with the nutcracker men are strangly coming true on the real battlefield. Is it possible that a little boy is controlling the outcome of World War I? The book,although fiction, sticks to the main facts of World War I in dealing with what battles were fought and the Christmas Truce of 1914. It is a good read for anyone who has an afternoon free to sit down and relax and enjoy a good book."
4,Good Read,I felt this book was well written and told a good story about a family being directly impacted by war. It is told somewhat by Johnny but also through his Aunti Ivy. The symbolism that is used in the carved figures by his father is great. The author describes some the conditions of trench warfare to give some ides. Overall it will keep your attention and wanting to learn more about the that event WWI.
1,Strong opinions; risky and unproven approach,"I've read about a dozen books on the topic of strategic outcomes for IT. The ""alignment"" theme with various names is common in them all.I expected this book to help me in my role as a strategic IT practices advisor.After a thorough reading the book seems naive to me. It suggests only obvious practices. When real issues are mentioned, the answer is you need a product. The book seems like a paper about the authors product.This is no case study. The book offers many stories to show a real problem exists. It doesn't give me any sense that this approach has been used before. This is my biggest complaint.I'm expected by clients to make good recommendations. I would never suggest that my clients try such an approach, with or without the product. I believe the book is all form and little substance."
2,MIS Ills explored,"Hoque gives great information on what troubles IT today. The Alignment Effect is quite fun to read. I think he gave me a sense of the IT situation in most corporations, beyond the few places I've been in my career.If I'd gained a sense of how to fix things, I'd give the book 3 or 4 stars. Unfortunately, I didn't get any sense of how to change things. The lack of suggestions to drive change is a shortcoming and left me empty and feeling partly like I wasted my time.I liked Sarv Devaraj's book on the IT payoff much better. It is dry and harder to read. On the plus side, it gives me an idea of what to measure and change first."
4,Practical Guiding Principles,"In ""The Alignment Effect"", Hoque has capture the essence of what companies of all sizes wrestle with in achieving value for their technology investment.As a CEO and former technology consultant, I would strongly suggest that people investing in technology invest in this book and understand it before spending one more dollar on technology. Once you do, the dollar you spend will be well-targeted in your organizations.Daniel G. MagniPresident/CEOBeaconVision"
2,Quick Read,"A quick pass through this book gives you a sense of issues for IT departments. Credibility is down, budgets squeezed, half finished projects. IT is in the dumps these days.I get the feeling Faisal Hoque thinks IT departments area stupd. They should be closely monitored by business leaders at all times. I agree.The book gives you a good sense of issues. It falls short on presenting solutions.It nicely covers IT governance. It is a good intro or refresher for governance and hits the right points for me."
1,No help for the weary,"I picked up this book after realizing the company is a vendor at our firm.I liked the forward and introduction. The book hits a nerve in today's enterprise. Everywhere I turn, and every other planning meeting here, the subject of IT alignment shows up.I read through the major sections to improve my skills. The principles are very mushy and hard to apply. Practical advice is non-existent.The author abandons software engineering, project planning, and IT management. She presents a strange collection of people-centric approaches and age-old groupware ideas. As if the only issue is not enough meetings and fuzzy stuff. The fuzzy stuff can help, but at the end of the day, business has many really tough challenges. This book offers no short cut and no help."
3,Funny start then....,Doesn't have the punch of Mr. Bean's endings.Cinematically jerky at the end. Some funny parts but not the best Rowan Atkinson I've ever seen.
2,Barely Black Adder,"I adore Black Adder, and while I admit that the plot/cinemagraphic quality varies from series to series, I believe Black Adder to be amongst the absolute best of British comedy. That being said, of all the episodes and specials, this is the worst. The lines lack the luster of Rowan Atkinson's usual sarcastic ferocity, the film quality is poor, the plot weak, the costumes leave much to be desired, and last few minutes look like they're out of a truly awful 1970's sci-fi flick. Should you buy it? That depends. If you're collecting all the episodes, its nice to be able to say you own it. If you're just interested in a few of them (or just in gaining another Christmas comedy) look elsewhere... like to the Elizabethan series."
1,Dickens rolls over in his grave,"This parody on the great classic was most insulting to the story and values that Dicken's held most dear. It totally reverses the story line (making the Scrooge character nice at the beginning and mean at the end) and I found it's attempt at humor insulting and at times vulger. Not a choice for those who truly love the classic tale. Of the 25 video versions of this classic that I own, this is the absolute worst!"
3,Typical John Saul,"Yet I still thought it was very well done. I started reading his books when I was in grade school. Suffer the children and Nathaniel are still some of my favorites. I liked the ""discovery"", nice twist. The ending was not very believeable, but I could not put down and wanted to always see what was going to happen next. Fast paced and great reading for the entertainment."
3,3 1/2 stars,"It starts as a rather unoriginal ghost story and doesn't stray to much into original material. But the way John Saul writes, and eventually wrenches up the suspense, it should still give readers a chill. John Saul will continue to be on my 'must read' list. For now anyway."
4,Very Good,This was the first book I've read from John Saul and was not disappointed. It had mystery and suspense.
1,Terrorizing the teens,"In the Dark of the Night has a central premise that is difficult to resist - what if the belongings of famous serial killers were gathered in one place? A better writer than John Saul really could have done something with this idea. But, unless you're 14, there's not much here to snag your attention or scare you. The three high school buddies out to get laid on their summer vacation stumble into a nightmare of a situation from which they can't extricate themselves. Why they couldn't have figured out what was going on after their first week at the lake doesn't say much for their intellectual powers. Saul's writing is formulaic. Phrases that were overused in some of his previous titles keep popping up here as well. ""It was as if..."" ""All he could think/ see/ feel was....""There's nothing new or genuinely horrific here, and what this book does contain isn't worth the time it takes to read."
2,Disappointed,"I really like John Saul as a writer but this one, I was really disappointed in. I had to force myself to finish it. It was just very boring. I think it could have been good, but it really did drag with nothing exciting happening. Read something else of his if you have never read him before. Try, When the Wind Blows."
3,It's okay,"This is the second book I've read by John Saul, the other being ""Creature"", I know he's written better one's that this but for some reason it just grabbed me. As I've seen in other reviews it does take too long for anything to get started about 110 pages. And it did still leave alot of questions and holes in the plot but overall it was entertaining enough to keep me coming back. I'd recommend this for other people who are fans of horror but they can skip right to page 100."
3,OK,"I hadn't read anything from this author in about 10 years. I was getting on a plane and just wanted an easy, non-thinking book to read. This one fit the bill and I was curious what I would think of the author after so many years. It was OK. It held my attention enough to finish it, and I was reasonably entertained."
1,Ridiculous,"I was so excited to delve into a scary summer read. What a mistake I made in choosing this book. The characters are totally unbelievable - especially the teenage boys. I should have stopped reading when it was remarked that one of the teenage boys used his ""handkerchief"" to clean up his dog's mess. A handkerchief? I quickly doublechecked the time and setting of the book. I thought maybe it was Victorian England. In my opinion the book went downhill from there. I ended up skimming the last 100 pages just to be finished with it. The only fright I got from this book was that I actually paid for it."
2,He's written better...,"He really didn't do much with the spirits of the serial killers. The only he really touched on was Lizzie Borden at the end, but by then, the book was almost done and I wanted it to be done. I had to force myself to finish it. The book wasn't even suspenseful or scary."
3,Good - but not Great...,Ok... maybe it's just that I wasn't paying complete attention... the book was good - not great - did not hold my interest as much as some of his past books...But when the kids (Mosler and the gang) are hired in the beginning to clean Pinecrest... don't they set some kind of booby trap - or something - to go off?Did I dream that? (I do read before I go to sleep!)
2,Had Potential,"I am a fan of horror and suspense novels, and John Saul is usually in the forefront of that genre. Unfortunately this novel falls short of my expectations of him. It had the potential to be a really good read, but the characters are underdeveloped and the story doesn't reach the magnitude it is built up to be. I feel that if the author wasn't so reputable that it would have tossed back by the company for some serious rewriting. I was truely disappointed with this particular book."
1,Dreadful!,"Boring, mundane, trite, contrived, zero character development. After reading 162 pages of this drivel I have finally given up and will not finish it. God knows, I tried but finally got to the point where I wished the house would swallow them all up (quickly)."
3,Spine-tingling super-fabulousness!!!!!!!!!!,"Saul's latest prose offering took some time to catch my interest. The description of Phantom Lake and Pinecrest, the massive Victorian mansion in which the Brewster family find themselves one fateful summer, were all right. Of course it all smacked of ""the usual fare"" for a Gothic horror story -- except for the part where Eric, Tad, and Kent start poking around in the carriage house.And there they find the motley collection amassed by Dr. Darby, Pinecrest's original owner -- and it is totally creepy. At the same time the triad of youths begin developing horrific nightmares and from there everything really starts going to Hell in a handbasket (literally).All in all I found this to be a welcome, ""easy-cheesy"" summertime fun read. Thanks, Mr. Saul!"
1,Waste of Paper,"I seriously cannot believe that this book made a best seller. This is the first time I have read a John Saul novel and I was VERY disappointed. This book lags so much that its almost painful to read. Thats truly the horror in this novel. He constantly refers to his characters by first and last name, which I find quite annoying. His characters are very poorly developed. One of the main characters, Merrill, is a worrier. Saul pounds this characteristic so much that you'll hate her rather than associate with her. His idea of how teenagers behave is so archaic that my grandmother would be the only one to relate. It takes almost 150 pages for him to actually get to some semblance of a story. He spends so much time repeating information you already know that you'll scream ""GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!"" I would delve into this more, but it would require spoilers. However I say save yourself the money, time, and read something by James Rollins, Michael Crichton, Richard Laymon, or Douglas Preston."
5,The most gruesome yet...,"I have been a long time fan of John Saul. At points in this book, I found myself nautious. I definately was not in the mood to eat during points of the book. Definately a change of pace for John and I great read for any fan."
5,The Greatest Adder Ever.,"The complete tone of this series of Black Adder is different from the others. No longer does Atkinson see the need for him to drive the plot, this allows the other players to shine as well as the wonderfully written scripts to shine through. Although he is still the fulcrum that the stories hinge upon.This video gives the veiwer as taste to what is going to be happening in the end of the show. The remergence of ""Bob"" as a young Tommy is equally remarkable, and special.This video is a must see for all those who thought that Rowan Atkinson was only a physical Comedian, as well as all true black adder fans."
5,excellent,"this is one of the most inetelligent and entertaining comedy series i have experienced set in the trenches of WW1. blackadder and his men are stuck at the front lines waiting for orders to advance. these characters are an absolute pleasure to get to know, from georges gungho willingness to fight, to blackadders schemes not to. for anyone that enjoys light, adult humor in a war setting, this is a must see."
4,"Gorgeous Motifs, But Bring Your Glasses","This book is filled with gorgeous charted designs that include Day of the Dead, Pagan, Celtic, and other folk motifs. Unfortunately, the charts are terribly difficult to read, not marked with stitch and row counts, and most are too big to use on anything but cloaks, blankets, and suchlike.The project directions are geared towards very experienced knitters and seamstresses; they'd be darn near useless for beginners.A valuable resource in spite of some flaws."
4,Excellent resource,"All of the Cartwright-Jones knitting books are wonderful, and this one adds to the collection with amazing designs and motifs from all over the world, plus detailed directions for a pillbox-type hat, lavishly patterned kneesocks, a drawstring bag, and a hooded cloak/coat. These are a far cry from most knitting patterns available--they are ethnically or historically inspired and they allow the knitter to fit and style according to her needs and taste. The only reason I don't give five stars is that the charts are hard to read and for some reason don't give the stitch x row counts the way the Tap Dancing Lizard book did. A word of warning: these patterns are geared heavily toward machine knitters. Hand knitters will not be as happy."
2,Hard to read the charts,"What were they thinking when they made the contrast so hard to read? What's wrong with black and white? The designs are attractive, but you'll go blind trying to reproduce them. Did I mention that the charts are hard to read?"
2,Not as good as their previous books,"This duo's previous books were packed with charts and ideas, but unfortunately Enchanted Knitting is a comparatively slim volume. The charts are nice, but there are many less, and many are too large to use on a 60st electronic card -- so if you don't have 200st programming capability, you'll be a bit out of luck. They reprise their ""coat"" pattern, with a few refinements, but otherwise, the patterns are not much to write home about. All in all, buy it if you are looking to spend some money -- but if you skip it, don't feel too deprived!"
5,Machine knitting,I have been wanting for this book for a very long time. The transaction was smooth and the book arrived in a timely fashion.I can't wait to knit up a design! Thank you very much.
3,Drains Battery if left plugged in.,I bought this on clearance at Target B&M. I hooked it up and put it in my truck for my kids to enjoy. My children (5 and 3) can use it with ease and it does not take up too much room but it will drain your battery if you do not unplug it or have it on a switched accessory port. I did not read that part of the manual so it is partially my fault but I have another TV/VHS player in my other vehicle (another brand) and I don&#146;t have to unplug that one. Overall I think it is a bad design and I will read manuals more carefully in the future. If I would have known this I would have returned it.
2,Perennial prodigy,"I heard Lang Lang performing this recital a few years ago here in Amsterdam. And, last year, I saw him in Beethoven's 4th piano concerto. More than enough.Suffice it to say that Lang Lang has a serious problem: at age 26, he still is a child prodigy. He hasn't the slightest idea of the profundity and emotional depth of, for example, Schubert's Wanderer Fantasie. His ""interpretation"" of Beethoven's piano concerto was a joke. Lang Lang hides his musical immaturity with mannerism, exaggeration and childish showmanship. The guy has no other choice.Let's hope this extremely gifted pianist will mature in the near future. If not, I think he will be forgotten within 5 years from now."
4,"Incredible technique, aristically good also","Despite his grotesque and faked stage mannerisms, Lang Lang's performance are poetic and thoughtful. Such is the case with his Abegg variations as well as his somewhat mannered yet full bodied Chopin Nocturne. As for the Liszt, Lang Lang concerns himself with the episodic details rather than the structural whole (which is fine depending on one's tastes). Other pianists may have better interpretations (Arrau, Richter), but Lang Lang is growing as an individual artist.By the way, for those who enjoy more refined stage choreography, try Yundi Li's live International Chopin competition DVD. On another side note, a reviewer's assertion that Lang Lang's popularity is the result of the chinese government is totally inaccurate and biased. He or she fails to take into account that AMERICA is the one marketing Lang Lang not CHINA."
2,very disappointed,"I am extremely upset that this DVD release does not contain an option for viewing angles. I am a musician and a pianist and I was looking forward to watching Lang Lang's hands, however, the camera work on this disc is just awful...it moves around so much and too quickly! The majority of the people buying this disc will be people like myself or teachers who are looking to gain insight into Lang's technique at the keyboard...but instead there's more camera time on Lang's facial expressions, which I find completely distracting.The video quality on the other hand is phenominal because it is shot in HDTV.To sum it up, if you are a casual admirer of classical music and Lang Lang you will probably enjoy this release but if you are a pianist you will hate it!"
5,Superb second album!,"Hopefully this cd will be carried again by Amazon (if it ever was.) Dreamy vocals and interesting lyrics by Kenny Childers follow the promise of the first Gentleman Caller cd, Ice Water. This one has more defined and catchy songs. This band is great live although now without Freda Love (whose drums produce a jittery and insistent beauty throughout this cd).I have over 1,000 cds but I listen to this at least a couple times every week."
4,not much out there that can match this,"Kovenant is a Norwegian hard-rock / gothic-rock / death-rock / (whatever you want to call it) band, who, with effective use of keyboard, organ, intensive drums and guitars, and powerful vocals, manages to create som very dignified pieces of music. The band first caught my attention when I saw them live as the supporting act for Zeromancer, another Norwegian band, and, even though I'm a huge fan of Zeromancer, Kovenant came close to putting the main act to shame. They threw the crowd into a frenzy. ANIMATRONIC, along with their previous release, NEXUS POLARIS, is a must for any fan of this sort of music. If you like Cradle Of Filth, you'll absolutely love this!"
4,good album,this is a really good black techno metal album.the only complain about it is the techno kind of slows it down.this is still great album.
1,How to become retarded in one easy step,"Covenant is forced to change their name to Kovenant. Who forced them to become stupid, pointless and cheesy? Nexus Polaris ('98) is on of the best black (space) metal albums of the '90s. This is one of the worst. Hellhammer puts in one of his best performances ever on Nexus Polaris. Here he keeps a beat. Imagine! Nagash becomes ""Lex Icon."" I become Superman. We battle eternally for the sins committed against mankind in the name of ""Animatronic"" Hail, Covenant. Please go away, Kovenant!!!"
5,Great album from a great band!,"Great album, it's metal, but it has a spacey feeling to it. It's something very refreshing and I know most of the so-called ""true"" metalheads won't dig this, because they would say it's commercial and that they should have sticked to the sound of Nexus Polaris.That's okay, everyone has it's own opinion, but you should really give this album a listen, you won't be disappointed. It needs time to really get to, but once it does, you will keep listening to this record. It's a strange album at first, but it needs to grow on you. I love it, I listen alot to Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, Children of Bodom and bands like that, but the Kovenant is my #1 band right now and it all began for me with this album. I almost have al the Kovenant albums right now.. SPACE METAL RULES!!!"
5,GREAT BAND. NOT MANSON.,"The Kovenant is one of the greatest bands from Europe i have seen so far, well greatest in Metal/industrial, that is. I dont know why everyone keeps thinking his copying manson, who cares. Lex icon(singer, bass) can do what he likes. Besides maybe thats what he likes to wear. Plus his vocals are a lot darker then mansons..(just listen to Sulphur feast from Nexus Polaris to prove that)Anyhow the album is great, just like Nexus Polaris. With great tracks such as, Mirrors Paradise, Human Abstract, Prophecies of Fire, and the powerful last track The Birth of Tragedy, i see a great future for the Kovenant.Hailz!"
3,Collectible Display only,"I got this set for my 6-year old son. The action figures were detailed and a better quality than the regular action figures. The Chewbacca figure was one of the best likenesses so far and my son loved it. The tin, however, is poorly made and was smaller than I had expected. It also bends so that the top and bottom sections don't match up and the clasp broke after a while. That was disappointing as I was hoping the tin would provide some storage for his action figures. It is definitely a collectible tin, made to sit on a shelf for display only. The action figures made up for it though and it's a nice set for the money for a young Star Wars fan."
4,Comedy Cult Classic,I highly recommend watching the entire series on PBS and buying several videos since they bear repeat viewing. There is something infectious about this camp show and its colorful characters. END
5,My Favorite Marlena Shaw Album--I love her!,"I was hooked on Marlena Shaw the first time I heard her rendition of 'Go Away Little Boy' from her 'Sweet Beginnings' album. Her poem on the album cover of 'Acting Up' says it all: ""Acting Up. When you express yourself with vivid words and colors, they say you're Acting Up. When you dare to be different from the way someone imagines you to be, they say you're Acting Up. Then Getting down Getting up Showing off Showing up Is when you fill your space with good thoughts of the you you want to be. Yes, I'm acting up."" I have lived by this mantra. Marlena is a treasure waiting to be discovered. Discover her."
2,Murad Resurgence,"only used this product for a week but I got it to Hydrate and prevent wrinkles. On the infomercial they talk about smoothing skin and blotchiness and giving a dewy appearance. My skin so far may feel firmer, but I have red blotches and dryness. Definately not moisturizing enough for my almost 40 skin.I don not think I wil continue with it, it is stating to burn when applied."
2,raqon,"This may be a good product. But when I looked in the mirror afterwords, boy was i surprised. Sparkles all over my face. I guess that is why it is ""lustre"". But I, for one, did not like the sparkles. I mean, I am not 15!! Like I said, i may be great but for the sparkles!"
5,Perfect!,I am reading several different books at once about Buddhism and such. But this is the ONE. I just love the way LSD writes and explains things. I can really uderstand the point he is trying to make. Not an easy thing to do when writing about Buddhism. The book is so good at times he sem to be writing just to me. Buy it! Read it! NOW and get the other books by LSD as well.;
3,Not as helpful as I though,This book is a little dated and not as helpful as I hoped it would be. You are better off asking a veteran teacher what you really need and they should be able to point you in the right direction more quickly than trying to get through this book.
3,Great...but out of date!,"I have been teaching art for 10 years and refer to this book often when I need to find definitions, artists names and work, quotes, or quick ideas. But, now that the internet has become such a reliable source, it needs to be updated with websites that are helpful to the art teacher!!! I find myself looking on the internet for hours searching through all of the information. Wouldn't it be great to add a page or two to this book of lists!"
2,Out of date...,"This book is so out of date. This book is just what it says, a book of lists. There is nothing in this book that I couldn't find in about 30 seconds online. If you don't have a computer in your room then it would be a good resources, but if you use the internet then it is a complete waste of money."
2,Not that great,"I got this book because of the great reviews on it. I thought it would be valuable tool in my art education resources. Sadly, I highly doubt I will ever use it. I give it 2 stars because I have hope still that for some reason one day, I might break it open. The use of google seems to work just as good for finding the information in this book."
1,Don't buy this book.,"This book does not acknowledge the contributions of female artists. In the ""lists"" of ""famous artists"" and ""artworks"" there are 100 males to each female. It is obvious that the author subscribes to the long-accepted, western-male ideals of art exemplars. To give Helen D. Hume some credit, she does include a list of ""feminist artists"". It includes about 13 women, who are female. She mentions people of color, hispanics and native americans. She does not acknowledge gay and lesbian artists. Also, the information in this book is often trite, misinformed and incorrect. The lesson ideas are unoriginal. I did not like this book."
4,Better than Scott's solo efforts,"While this is, in essence, a Scott Kelly solo project it does involve other folks. Most notably Noah Landis (also of Neurosis). The songs are, I feel, more fleshed out and better written than on Scott's records under his own name. It's a depressing record, but one that's extremely honest and heartfelt. I believe I've read that these songs were the first Scott had written after becoming sober. To me the really standout tracks are 'Remember Me', 'Shining King' and 'At the Foot of the Garden'. As an side it's interesting how Scott's (and Steve Von Till's, for that matter) solo record reflect the same atmosphere, emotions, and ethos as Neurosis, but in a quieter, more introspective way. Maybe not so surprising though."
3,the bed you sleep in,"Acting is superb,but the long tedious shots of the small town are as exciting as watching an X-Ray film I kept wanting to fast forward.Watched it once and then straight into the never watch again basket."
5,Bargain hunter at Amazon,This arrived in great condition and is exactly as pictured! I love it and wear it often. Goes with everything.
4,Perfect for a young toddler,"Honestly, I'm glad some parents have found this book helpful in preparing their children for doctor's visits. Personally, though, I like it because it is:1. Short.2. Colorful, with simple illustrations.3. Featuring Corduroy. Not Corduroy as I knew him as a child, but Corduroy who my 1.5 year old son cannot tear apart (he's not READY for a longer book, and how could the classic Corduroy tales be retold in 12 pages?).4. Has something of a plot--arrives at the office at the beginning, leaves at the end. A lot of adaptation books like this (including some in this series) lack that VERY important element, in my opinion.My son passionately likes all the books in the Corduroy Board book series--the illustrations, number of pages, and amount of text per page are PERFECT for a young toddler. I'm not sure why this book is recommended by Amazon for 4-8 years old--not knowing that age group well, I can only say that for the 12 month and up crowd, these books are great!"
3,"Charmless, but potentially useful","It makes me a little sad to see how far Corduroy has fallen from those first amazing books... The illustrations are generic and kind of cheesy, and the text is pretty thoughtless -- when Corduroy gets weighed his doctor notes that he has ""...gained a lot of pounds; too many cookies Corduroy,"" with the little bear looking downcast as he stands mostly naked on the scale. Let's hope our pediatricians treat weight issues with a little more sensitivity. Still, I'm forced to give this book 3 stars for the reasons the other reviewers stated: it gives a decent overview of what to expect at the doctor's, from getting undressed to getting a shot."
1,Very disappointing,"The trailer made this look like a lot of fun, and given the content, it should have been. But it wasn't. In fact, it was downright dreary. The film's pacing was terrible, with it constantly stopping and starting for flashbacks right in the middle of action sequences. This went on ad infinitum. Then there's the unexciting and badly shot fight scenes, the pointless pausing for unnecessary narration, the wooden performances by the leads, etc, etc. Each to their own, of course, but for me it was deathly dull."
5,As functional as it is Pretty!,"The suction is great, much better than our old dust buster. The plum color is gorgeous as well. I have never wanted to clean baseboards and corners more than when I got the ""Kone"". The filter cleans easily too, and works great! I love this vac and would highly reccomend it!"
3,Toy Vacuum,"This is a cute looking little thing, but not ""table-top"" cute. If you only want it to pick up a few fallen crumbs you won't be disappointed, but it's noisy, heavy, and needs frequent cleaning out. It's not easy to slip back into its holder quickly."
3,Cute but lacking power,"I like the look of this hand vac, which is why I bought it. However, the suction end is too small, and it lacks power."
3,Dirt Devil Kone,"This product arrived promptly and I was happy about that. However, when I opened it there was a big label on the box that said ""blemished product."" I sent two E-mails asking them to explain what this meant but I have received no response from them. The product does seem to work properly but I never would have bought it if I had known it was blemished in some way."
2,Big Disappointment,I got this because I was tired of lugging around a big vacuum hose to get corners and hard to reach spots. This doesn't do much better. Not very powerful. The little bag fills up fast. I've been really disappointed with it.
5,Very Pleased,"I can't believe I lived w/o a dirt devil this long! I have two kids!! What was I thinking? Oh, I remember - I was thinking they are too ugly to have on hand so I'll never use one. But this thing is actually attractive. We keep it on our kitchen counter. The plum color and spacey design compliment our retro kitchen theme. It sucks up well and is actually fun to use. Go for it!"
5,This Really Works!,"The Kone by Dirt Devil really does work! I have had one for over a year and wanted another in the Plum color for one of the other areas in my home. First they are extremely attractive and fits into any decor. Recharges all the time in the stand and ready to use. Cleans scraps and dirt on a kitchen linoleum floor, use on the tile in the bathroom and pick up small particles on the rug just in time for company. Easy to clean out. Twist open in the middle and remove small dirt basket. Empty, put back in and your ready to go again. Simple press on button at end of top. Highly recommend. Just bought my daughter-in-law one. She loves it too!Dirt Devil 0213PLM Kone Cordless Hand Vacuum - Plum"
2,Cool...but not for pet hair!,"Yeah, this is a swank hand vac. But unless you're picking up some dry product (spilled dry cereal, fallen Christmas tree needles) from a hard floor, this isn't going to do much for you. Somehow the reviews here led me to believe it would pull up cat hair from the carpet. I needed something small to do the stairs with, because our Dyson is too much of a beast to maneuver on the stairs. The Kone is not the thing I want. Unfortunately, the box is long gone, so I can't return it. Learn from my mistakes!"
5,kone hand vac is great,"wonderful product! works great, easy to use and clean and matches our new purple kitchen. a winner!"
4,Powerful vacuum,"I've had a few handheld rechargeable vacs, but none were as powerful as this one. Reinserting it in the base is a bit tricky, since it only goes in one way, and the base and the vacuum are unmarked. Also, a brush attachment would be great for vacuuming rugs and such."
3,good hand vac,"I got this hand vac for xmas and was very excited, i thought it was a great looking hand vac that you could have around the house without looking tacky. It does not have as much sucking power as a lot of its competitors and also was a little more expensive because of the way it looks but overall i am pretty happy with it."
2,Battery life not good at all,Product is good looking. Got this for a gift from one of my co-workers but didn't last long. It's a built in rechargeable battery that cannot be replaced. Used it and worked great for about 3 months and the battery started dying out within seconds althought it was charged all day.
2,Disappointing decoration,"I've had this for about 4 years now, and I barely use it because of how lame it is. For those of you looking to vacuum up some lightweight dust here and there, this will probably be fine. Heavier dirt, grass and hair...forget it. The suction is pitiful. I've often tried to vacuum up small pieces of grass and end up just chasing it around for a while to no avail. The nozzle is very small and narrow, not great for larger surfaces. The unit is a bit tricky to hold because of the conical design.I will say the design is lovely (for a vacuum) and understated, however it's still not something I like to display in the open. It is also quiet, probably because it's also underpowered. It's also quite easy to clean out.I'd say find something more powerful for the price (albeit, much uglier). Just keep it in the closet where no one will see it."
5,Leadbetters & Goods are more than good! They're GREAT!,"I saw this series when it came to US TV some years ago (thank you, forever, PBS). I loved it then. I love it now. I've got the whole collection, finally.Stars: Tom & Barbara Good, played by Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal - whom I worship, and Margo & Jerry Leadbetter, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington.I also saw Felicity Kendal in a PBS replay of the BBC Shakespeare series with her starring as Viola in ""Twelfth Night"" and was so impressed that I named a daughter after her.Felicity (and the other cast members) are believable, funny, and always in trouble, love, etc., with each other.The setting... Tom & Barbara move to a ritzy neighborhood and start a farm... well, more like they decide to ""live off the land."" Try that in a swank neighborhood and I'm sure you'll end up with some of the problems they had.Totally hysterical. Very funny. A must see. Own it if you can. Definitely for the whole family."
1,Fake Climat,"My mom has real Climat made in France and she knows for sure that the one she received from Amazon is fake. It doesn't smell like real Climat and for this price you'll be getting a well packaged counterfeit. You won't be able to send it back because as soon as you open it, there will be no refund via Amazon, so if you are among those who love this fragrance and used to have real Climat, do not buy it. If it's your first your first acquaintance with this fragrance, then you won't know how real Climate smells like.I love buying things from amazon and I never had any problems, but it looks like they're selling this perfume without checking the authenticity of it."
1,The Climat I ordered was faked,"When I received Climat, I noticed that covered plastic was glued and did not have special stamps on the top and the bottom indicating that Climat's box was previously opened and closed again. I thought it could be fake and sent it back to Amazon. I would advise to examine plastic integrity before opening a perfume box."
1,Do not buy,"My wife has been using Climat perfume for years and obviously knows how it should smell. This item is definately not real Climat, but a very inferior imitation, whose fragrance lasts about 3 minutes before wearing off. Do not waste your money on this item. Unfortunately one does not know how bad it is until after it is opened, which then makes it non returnable."
1,Climat Perfume,"I purchased this product but don't think it is the original / authentic perfume. It smells of alcohol and evaporates fast. I still have the original perfume of the 1980s and this smeels completely different. It smells much better and lasts longer. I would not purchase this item again. If, at all, it's the Eau de Toilette that has been filled into the bottle that says ""perfume"" on it. Also, on the bottle it says ""Lancome"" - without the ""little roof"" on the ""o"" which would be the original French spelling."
5,Just love it!,"It's the most sexiest parfum ever, very noticable, I got tones of complements on it.I use it for over 10 years and am not going to change for another one.I am from Europe, and it's very popular there."
1,"Is this the forgotten smell of real ""Climat""...???","Sorry,but i had to drop a line and say merchandise sold is NOT 100% Authentic, it is NOT the real ""Climat"" !!!Even the color is not the same..."
5,"fabulous Guitar player, great DVD = 5 stars!!!","Unlike many DVD lessons which are merely video transfers this lesson features audiophile sound and fantastic image quality. Also during the lessons you can use the remote to view either his left or right hand closeups or full view....amazing! there are also bonus songs and the option to view the performance only!!! whether you want to watch this guitarist just play his tunes or get a wonderful lesson this DVD is the real deal ....oh and it is ALL REGION not region 1 as amazon states!!!tunes included are: Eureka Hotel, Meant To Be, She Moved Through the Fair, Smoky Mountain Morning, The West Wind, E-Funk, and After Dark. Many of these tunese are from Al's ""Shades of Blue"" CD...and his mix of celtic, blues and R&B influences are well displayed...wonderful!!!"
1,Inappropriate,"If you wish to find solace in a few pages regarding Diana's death, go somewhere else. The judgemental incrimination, and the adulation expressed for Prince Charles doesn't quite cut the grief one feels for her. However, if you like the author, try another title. I rate it one - one too many than the named publishing company (""Zero"") already expresses."
5,Whispers the truth to your heart...,"This story will fill you with rememberance as you are taken through the past-life history of this starry being, bringing your own anscestry to life. Your heart will remember when you had fallen far far from the starry heavens, and where you landed as you awoke to a new earthly light."
3,Great camera but....,"Based on all the very good reviews, I went for this camera as my first plunge into the digital photo realm. Aside from some minor ergonomic issues with the shape of the camera, I've been pleased. Image quality is excellent. My only problem so far - getting one that works. The first one I received was inoperative right out of the box. The replacement for that one died after five weeks and is now at Canon for repair. I haven't seen other problems with reliability mentioned anywhere so perhaps my troubles are rare (I hope)."
4,Noisies of LCD,"I just bought the camera and whenever i saw what's on the LCD, I remember one of the reviews here about ""snow flakes"" and lines on the LCD. I am having exactly the same problem. But the captured images are displayed fine on it.I used Kodak DC280 and a SONY digital camcorder before, so i have an idea about what the LCD should look like. I will try to contact Canon to find what the problem is."
5,Easy to use,"I am not a photography pro, but after lots of research and buying the wrong camera a few times, The G1 was recommended by friends that do photography for a living. It really is easy to use and the battery lasts as long as you need it (for me anyway). I bought a spare anyway. Haven't needed to use it yet. I've shot 60+ shots on a charge without running out of power An added flash is a necessity. The built in flash is good for only 14 feet or so."
3,Drawback,"While I like this camera, one shortcoming any serious user should be aware of - All shutter speeds above 1/500 only work with f8.0 - So, if it's a cloudy day and you're shooting sports, an exposure of 1/800s at f2.8 won't work.This makes the Shutter Preferred and Aperture Preferred modes of limited value. If you're not going to be shooting on AUTO, you might want to look at another camera."
5,OUTSTANDING CAMERA,"You can't go wrong with this camera. I love it. The only problem I had was with the LCD sreen. It had lines going through it when it was in record mode, but I called canon and they said with proof of purchase it was under a warranty for a year (WOW, no that's cool). Trust me you'll definately be satisfied with this camera."
4,Great camera with few faults,"I bought my G1 5 monts ago and have found it to be an excellent overall performer. The lens is very sharp and I have found the spot meter to be particularly useful in general shooting. There are some drawbacks -- shutter delay is present and is sometimes a problem in shooting candid photos. Also, I found it very difficult to get good printed results until I purchased a Canon S800 printer. The Canon printer provided excellent printed results. Even though film may have higher resolution in theory, my prints from the Canon were as sharp or sharper than anything I've seen from prints from the local drugstore."
3,Poor External Flash performance,"The G1 is an excellent point and shoot camera, but failed to perform well with an external flash. I tried two cameras and returned both because of this failure. The instructions (and Canon) imply that manual exposure with manual flash power should behave as well as with a film camera - it does not do this. Exposure is hard to set, unpredictable and several stops overexposed."
4,Almost perfect,"My first digital camera has been excellent but people reading reviews want to know about limitations. 1. Flash is pretty poor- certainly not on par with the rest of the camera. I need to try the speed lite (nice that you can do that). 2. Limited accessories. I would like to mount the camera to other devices but have found this almost impossible. 3. Slow on the draw due to the need to have the lens protrude and retract. These quibbles are pretty minor. For the price, this is a great device. I would give it 4.5 stars if that were an option."
2,2.0 ah batteries,I have both a 3.0 and a 2.0 amperage battery. I noticed over time that the 2.0 last half as long or less. I got it as a rebate and its basically a back up battery compared to the two that came with the purchase. I am in the market for the Li-Ion batteries because of the battery drain since I bought it. The drill or slash all cordless drills are very much a part of getting use to from my experience but I would recommend if you put in the money ( over $200 ) buy in terms of longevity. I have used mine periodically for the past two years ( dmv 18volt ) and now looking for a new purchase. Love the convience of the cordless but over time they fade. Get either a 3.0 ah or get ready to pay out for another battery. Thats why I am looking for a Li-Ion. Maybe they will last longer than the Ni types. Hopefully I find a review on the Li-Ions. Peace.
1,Lets get it straight,Boss audio is a good brand but this particular product is not worth wasting money on?Over heats the amplifier.
5,Erotica at its finest!,"Reginald Martin has done it again with this amazing, entertaining and diverse collection of black erotica. From the informative ""Do Right Women"" by Kalamu Ya Salaam to the fanciful food descriptions by Valinda Johnson Brown, Dr. Martin explores the many shapes and forms of the finest erotic writings of the time. Some of the writings will leave you with a tender smile and some wet and quivering. No matter your literary preferences, this book is guaranteed to take you deeper into your erotic self than you ever imagined possible."
5,robotchicken review,"Perhaps the best one of the robot chicken star wars trilogy yet. It's telling me I have to write 20 words. Let's see here; it brought me immense joy. A joy I have never experienced before, and never thought possible.Seriously it was good."
3,Robot Chicken Star Wars 3,"I was disappointed by the latest Robot Chicken take on the lovable and oh-so-easily-parodied Star Wars franchise.There are a few laughs, but I kept getting the feeling that either the fire's gone out, or that Green's crew is just trying too hard this time around.I recommend buyers to wait for the price to dip."
2,Loved the first 2. This one... not so much.,"I am a long time Robot Chicken fan and a hardcore Star Wars nerd so I pretty much love anything SW related. I own the first to ""episodes"" of Robot Chicken Star Wars, and really enjoyed them. This one was a disappointment. The jokes weren't that funny. It was edited poorly. It will remain in my collection of SW crap but I will probably never put it in my DVD player again."
4,Please Help,"i bought this DVD and I've loved robot chicken for years, but i was a bit confused when my copy of this dvd went for 35 mins when i know that it goes for 45 mins. i noticed that from a certain scene the next 10 minutes are missing. the scene where obi wan uses Jedi mind tricks in the mirror. from there the next 10 mins are missing. did anyone else have this problem or should i return it to store and ask for another copy?PS i bought this item elsewhere.My favorite scene was cut :( Palpatine on the escalator"
4,The best of the three!,"RCST 1 was good,RCSW 2 was great,but RCSW 3 is an absolute classic.It captued the STAR WARS saga in a hilarious manner.A top notch hilarious special."
4,Saw this on AS,"I saw this when it came out on AS, so I don't know about DVD extras, extended scenes or anything from the DVD.I love the whole Robot Chicken franchise anyway, but I've really been loving the Robot Chicken Star Wars stuff. In the other editions they covered the rest of the movies and basically wrapped up the series, but here they come back and tell everything from the Emperor's point of view, which I thought was cute.There were some things that looked a little choppy, but it wasn't too bad, and the hilarity of it all more than made up for mess ups.This was great."
2,Forgetable,"I'm sure this review won't come as a surprise to anyone who read any other review of the same product.RC: SW Episode III is bland and rarely humorous video. I read all the reviews before buying it and still went ahead as I already own other 2 discs, but this one was waste of money. It's worth seeing once, but that's about it. There's no replay value to it whatsoever.On a lighter note, other 2 are worth having for sure :)"
4,"Excellent, covers all the bases",A well researched book with excellent templates to help put all this knowledge into place. I am currently using it to help me manage the development of a large power plant in Brazil. I highly recommend reading and following the principles outlined by Wysocki and Weiss. A valuable tool for any project manager.
3,To enhance my knowledge on the subject,To assist me in my office project management which is currently just in progress. The planning and scheduling information is required and important to the sucess of this project.
3,"Beautiful Photos, light on data.","I purchased this book primarily for the beautiful photography. The text is very brief. Unfortunately, it is also filled with much erroneous information."
1,non music video,"When I recieved this product, roght on the package it says this disc does not contain any music! So why buy it?"
5,We're impressed!,"We are very impressed with Vol. I of Kid's Guitar, by Homespun Tapes. Mary Marxer is upbeat, cheery, and easy to track with. The set is colorful, and she goes slowly enough that the children can 'get it' but not too slowly. We will definitely be ordering Vol. 2 when we're finished learning all there is to master in this first DVD. Highy recommended for beginners, or those who need a refresher course!"
2,Annoying and difficult,I bought this as a gift for my 10 y/o daughter who really wants to learn how to play guitar. I was extremely disappointed. The exercises were difficult for beginners and the video is extremely annoying. The music is dated and the over all quality wasn't great. Low budget and not very effective.
3,Not a book,"This is not a book, it's more of a folded paper newsletter. It does attract attention in the worst possible ways."
4,seat cover,"Arrived when it should have, just what my husband wanted. He could not believe I got such a good deal on sheepskin."
4,What a fun book of unusual origami! :),"VNO is a delightful book and well worth collecting for any lover of paperfolding who also enjoys novelty folds. The diagrams are very clear and models are at an accessible skill level, making them ideal for beginners to the art of origami and easily memorized so you can amaze your friends next time you're at a party, flirting with a pretty partner, or just out enjoying a pint. While at first glance, the more puritanically minded might recoil or take offense at the subject matter of the book, Nick Robinson also engages the reader with an entertaining history of Naughty Origami. In addition each fold is prefaced with an enjoyable discussion of the model - including trivia, history, suggestions for folding and suitable display scenarios. This is one of the few books on my shelf that is as much fun to read through as it is to fold from."
3,"Good ideas, but vague designs.","Very fun, creative ideas, though for some of the finished products it was very hard to tell what they were, even in the pics. The ""Boobs"" were especially vague."
2,Semi Naughty Origami,"The instructions are clear, but the items are not. It is a shame because this could have been a very cute book of cleaver items to fold and show off...I will stick to folding cranes and butterflies."
3,widescreen please!,"It is absolutely wrong that this movie has not been released in it's proper (and original) widescreen version of 1.75:1. Especially considering that with the advent of digital, widescreen broadcasting nearly everyone now has a widescreen tv."
3,Good but can it be used on WOOD floors?,"I have been trying to find out if this product can be safely used on hardwood floors. Bissell used to make two different products - one for hard floors (ceramic, etc.) and one for wood floors, but they have discontinued the wood floor cleaner. I really liked the wood floor cleaner and thought that was what I was ordering at Amazon, however, it wasn't, instead I was sent the hard floor cleaner, which states on the bottle it is NOT for hardwood floors!. The hard floor cleaner works, but will it damage my floor? I really would like some clarification. I called their help line and was routed to someone in India (Pakistan?) who read to me the same information I already had from their internet site."
1,Leaves streaks and Spots,"I love the smell as it smells of citrus. I could sniff this stuff all day, but it is the worst cleaning solution. It leaves streaks and spots. I bought the pink 1 gallon Proforce floor cleaning solution from Sam's Club as it lasts years even though I clean the floors almost every day (toddlers in the kitchen)."
2,campy,"This movie is called ""Fire Monsters against the Son of Hercules"" but there are no fire monsters in the movie."
3,Old effects,This was made with old special effects that weren't as good as the later ones. But for an old Hercules movie fan it might be a wanted item in your collection.
4,Nice showpiece,"If you are looking for historical accuracy, or are considering being a reenacter, this is not the helmet for you. I would suggest you visit a reenacters' site (and there seem to be several for Roman enthusiasts) for recommendations in that area. However, if you are looking for a very cool looking helmet for costume or display purposes, this is a very good buy for the price."
4,Nice display helmet.,"The helmet and plume are as pictured. The helmet arrived undamaged and if will fit the average male head(no liner). It had a little tarnish on it, but after using metal polish it has a nice shine to it. The plume is unattached and was easy to put on. If you LARP or just want to have a nice display piece, you'll like it."
3,Beat Up,"This helm was definitely punted around or dropped somewhere between going from India (where it is made) to the United States. The visor is severely bent. The plume is also bent so much that when the helm is on your head straight, the plume is about 5-8 degrees pointing off center.There are also numerous scratches on the steel and on the inside.There are no holes to secure a strap of any type to keep it on your head. I'm 6 ft, 240, & it's significantly larger than my head, even with the helmet pad I bought separately. I'll need to drill holes to secure it to my head for Halloween.Otherwise (hah), the product looks great. It'll serve the purpose for Halloween & I'll be able to spin the ""battle-worn"" story for the helm."
4,Not bad,"The helmet arrived with no damage and was quite simple to put together. However, there was no good way to put the plume on so I decided to make my own attachment out of leather shoe laces. I left them long and turned out to look rather good."
4,A really enjoyable outing for the good Doctor,"Stones of Blood really is an enjoyable story to watch. The story is fairly cohesive (always a bonus in Doctor Who!), and you really get the impression that everyone enjoyed playing their parts. The professor Amelia Rumford is a great character, and you can't help but think she'd have made an excellent companion. There is good humour throughout, and the Doctor gets some good one-liners (such as John Aubrey making Druids as a joke..), and some silly one-liners concerning things like sterilized knifes. The trial scene is also quite amusing, but how the doctor manages to escape execution so many times is beyond me! (""OBJECTION!"",, *Sigh*,""What Now?"")The point is that the story flows, it's fun to watch, and despite there being several unanswered questions, you don't worry too much about them. Four stars for Stones of Blood."
3,Fascinating Subject,I liked the thoughtful treatment of the Dogon. It is a very complex subject and I would have benefitted from more illustrations. I recommend this to someone already familiar with the subject and seeking a detailed analysis of how the Dogon creation explanation compares to other creation stories and the strong possibility of a single source.
2,this wasnt what i expected,"my daughter is in 2nd grade, and after completing several things she became bored and just says its too hard.. i was really disappointed in this one.. she did like the explorers part, but as far as the math and reading.. it just wasnt fun enought to want to LEARN on lol.. maybe when she's older I hope.. not sure......"
3,Satisfactory.,"It's a decent product, although not as interesting or amazing as other learning-type software out there for this age group. The math and reading levels do not seem to be in sync with each other, but it's easy enough to go to the level that best fits your child. If you are an educated, progressive, and open-minded parent, the ""magical"" stuff won't bother you a bit."
3,No worse than Disney!,"These cd's are fine in terms of content. There is no more magic in them than there is in a Disney movie. Now to grade the cd's on their REAL content: the explorers cd is excellent. My five year old can play the games and proceed just fine. It is great for teaching about other cultures. As for the math - well I was ready to toss it out! There are no instructions for how to play the games. It takes a lot of experimentation with the mouse, arrow keys, enter key etc. to figure out which tools are needed to do the tasks. As for the reading - we haven't tried that one yet."
5,Great CD,"Wow What a great cd, 300 songs for 10 dollars!! This Cd is amazing, if you don't have it you should definatly buy it."
3,The Long And The Short...,"Actor / director, Conrad Brooks (Plan 9) is in both movies while directing only GYPSY VAMPIRE. THE SATURN AVENGER VS. THE TERROR ROBOT is the shorter (20+ min.) and far better of the two features. The home-made robots w/ their trashcan bodies, dryer-duct-hose limbs, and bucket heads are marvelously cheezy! The amazon gals are prrrfect, especially their queen! The eeevil Boltar, his Mangler-minions, and the Terror robot itself are hilarious! The Saturn Avenger arrives to aid Doc (Brooks), Skip, the G-500, and a highly suspect ""jungle beast"" in their fight against the nefarious Boltar. This intentionally idiotic masterpiece is worth the price of the DVD! Unfortunately, GYPSY VAMPIRE is loooong (an hour), dull, and meandering. I give the 3 stars for SATURN AVENGER alone..."
4,Works well (some extra debris inside),I have flat feet and sometimes my ankles wear out. This stuff was great on my feet after a long day. I dropped it one star because there was some funky ocean debris other than salt that found its way into my tub of salt.
2,Flared up my psoriasis,"I've only tried this once. The water felt very soft, but when I got out of the tub my psoriasis was much pinker. I may have gotten the water too hot, but it was only warm. Don't think I could handle a tepid bath, so I'm moving on to something different."
5,Best Bath Salts in the World,Love these and they smell fresh and clean. Buy this brand before they go up in price because soon who knows? The Masada may start to be preserved before it's bought all up.
2,Why Bother??,"I knew better; I really did. But I read the 2 great reviews, and being a ""Grobanite"", jumped at the chance to hear something ""Josh related"" while he works on his new CD. I got 1/2 way through this CD, and turned if off, to quickly replace it with a ""real"" Josh CD, ""Closer"". I had an overwhelming need to hear his rich, beautiful voice, to make the world right again! Why would anyone want to hear his music without his voice in it!I gave this CD 2 stars because in itself it's not a bad CD, if you like piano music. I think it has too much synthesizer, which distracts from the ""live"" piano. To me though, the world has turned upside down if you prefer this when you can listen to the real thing. Save your money for when Josh's new CD is released this summer.Now, what to do with this tribute CD? Frisbee, anyone?"
4,Lady From Chunking,"One of Anna May Wong's better roles, but the story could be offensive unless you realize that at the time it was filmed Japan had ""invaded"" China and she was very pro Chinese, anti Japanese and raising money to help the affected in China where she had relatives."
4,Very nice.,"This is a great album. The production is excellent and every track is at least good. This is definitely one of those ones that you can listen to start to finish. Amerie is not the best vocalist, but she works with what she has. The album overall is very upbeat, go-go type of stuff. It is fun and enjoyable. The songs are very catchy, too. I would definitely recommend adding this album to your collection."
4,TOUCH !,"AMERIE IS A UNIQUE SINGER, WHICH SHE SHOWS ON THIS CD. HER STYLE OF MUSIC IN THIS CD IS VERY OLD SCHOOL 80'S FLAVA STYLE TO IT. ALL THE TRACKS ARE LIKEABLE AND OK TO LISTEN TO.MY FAVORITE TRACKS :ONE THING - AWESOME SONG. THIS WAS A GOOD SINGLE FOR HER.NOT THE ONLY ONE - ANOTHER FAVORITE SONG OF MINE. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE.COME WITH ME - ALSO SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE. HAS AWESOME BEATS.TALKIN ABOUT - KINDA SOUNDS LIKE ONE THING.JUST LIKE ME- A BEAUTIFUL BALLAD. THIS IS MY FAVORITE TRACK ON THIS ALBUM. HER VOICE SOUNDS SOOTHING. THIS SONG SHOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN A SINGLE.THE OTHER SONGS ON THIS ALBUM R OK, BUT THESE WERE THE SONGS THAT STAND OUT MORE THAN THE OTHERS.I HOPE ON HER NEXT ALBUM SHE HAS MORE DANCEABLE SONGS LIKE ON HER SINGLE ONE THING."
4,4 1/2 Stars... Not Enough Variety,"Amerie is a great artist, beautiful woman, and has something to offer the industry, BUT something is lacking here. The album is pretty solid even though her debut was a bit better. She did have a lot more writing credits and different producers instead of solely Rich Harrison on her first album, but once he started giving beats to other artists (Beyonce mainly) her niche sound was pretty much gone. So when she comes back out again this year, she needs a whole new sound and some different producers without relying too much on Rich Harrison.Standout songs: "" 1 Thing"", ""Touch"", ""Come With Me"", and ""Falling"""
4,Why isn't she a bigger star?,"She's got everything Beyonce has: gorgeous looks, great voice, impressive dance moves. The go-go-tastic 1 Thing does sound similar to Crazy In Love, but has it's own individual flair. Other highlights are the sensual Arabic flavored title track (and I usually hate Crunk&B;!), whimsical Falling, All I Need, Rolling Down My Face (check out the Roy Ayers sample!), Just Like Me, and Can We Go, a duet with Carl Thomas.There are a couple of missteps. The pointless 1 Thing remix is the same exact song with an added rap by Eve. Why not change the music or something? Also, I can't stand the remix of Why Don't We Fall In Love. The original is sweet and summery, but the newer version doesn't do it for me. Why is a song from her first album included here anyway?Bottom line, Amerie is sorely underrated. Her time has been long overdue and I'll be the first to cheer her on when it comes."
1,Just a pretty face...,"This girl makes me laugh! 1thing sounds like crazy in love and get right.Why did she get the Aretha Franklin Award last summer? ...She wasn't the entertainer of the year. She just released a single before the award.I really do not know why peolpe complained in 2002 about Ashanti (at least she released always on time, foolish, whats luv, happy, baby and down 4 U before winning the award...)"
2,Too Little - Too Late,"As a BW consultant, I found the content to be untimely (mostly based on version 1.2B) and incomplete. I purchased this book when it first came out hoping for a resource that was more comprehensive and insightful. What I found was what appeared to be a collection of disconnected ""whitepapers"". In short, the need for a comprehensive 'How-to' guide to BW remains unfulfilled."
4,another great read,"As always, anything John writes is as refreshing, earthy and entertaining as a day spent fishing for real. The only disappointing thing about his books is arriving at the last page and realizing that the journey is over!"
5,Trout Fishing,i recently received this book and it is an easy and enjoyable read. Gierach has a way with words and when put in the context of fly fishing makes for a fun read. Makes one think too!
4,Bikini top,Easy to install very well made and it fits perfectly. Would recommend this product to anyone needing such an item as this. Shipped ahead of schedule
4,Great album,Not QUITE as great as some of the reviews have indicated - the sound quality is not the best - but still pretty good. Gets better as it goes along - the best tracks are near the end.
5,Smoothe & Sexy,"Kevin's version of many classics is a real treat. His deep smoothe voice adds a ""grown and sexy"" touch to some of my favorite love songs. Nature Boy is my favorite track on the cd. It's a perfect blend of a great musical harmony mixed with his smoothe lyrics. This is a must buy for a romantic evening with the lights dimmed."
1,Exterior Display Screen! GONE!,"I've had this phone for just a little over a year. The display screen has totally faded, which means that I no longer have an exterior caller ID, which really sucks. I took the phone to Sprint to see what they could do and they told me I was just slightly out my warranty and I could 1. get a new phone or 2. get the insurance, wait a few weeks and then send in a $35 deductible for a replacement. Well I don't think so. I'm switching to VERIZON. SPRINT REALLY REALLY SUCKS. They don't do anything to keep their customers happy."
1,BAD PHONE,"MY HUSBAND ACTUALLY HAS THIS PHONE AND EVERYDAY ALL IHEAR IS, "" I JUST WANT TO THROW THIS PHONE INTO A WALL."" THE BATTERY LIFE IS TERRIBLE AND BOTH THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SCREENS ARE GONE. OF COURSE SPRINT CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT AS USUAL. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE."
1,NOT A VERY GOOD PHONE FOR 3 REASONS,"1. not many features-no texting, you can only recieve texts from the internet. Also no internet.2. Horrible reception. When your talking you miss words that people are saying when in bulidings.3. calls dont always make it to you. people have called me and i dont know it until i get a voicemail which is very fustrating. It rings once and goes to voicemail.-dont buy this phone, you get what you pay for!"
4,It's a nice phone.,I brought a LG1200 last summer and hadno problem with it.I like because it smalland I can put it in my pants pocketno belt clip needed for this phone.I use it everyday at work and the callsare crystal clear.
1,AVOID!!!,"Nice compact size, but..........display faded within weeks of initial use. the AC adapter also died suddenly. I think the manufacturers and Sprint have noticed, so they replace it with the Samsung A460 instead. Can't stand the A460 either - features too cumbersome to use. Anyway, avoid, avoid, avoid, no matter how cute it looks."
2,No wireless web or text messaging,I just bought this phone to replace a broken one and much to my dismay it doesn't have wireless web or text messaging capability!
4,Flowers,Flowers were delivered on time and my mother said they were pretty. So I consider that a success.
1,Worst service ever,I ordered this with the promise that it would be delivered BY Mother's day. I got confirmation it would NOT be sent until AFTER Mother's Day. Never will I use this service again.
4,Works Well,"Wells well for me. I was confused by another reviewers comment about changing the filter after a week, I took 3 months of constant use for our filter to be changed."
2,Dont`bother,This is a load of old rubbish. The voice over is like that of a guy that need an operation on his vocal chords. The sound is also out of sync with the picture. Pity cause the picutures are ok!
5,Viking Invasion - A Cult Classic,"Although some years old now - in gaming terms at least - Viking Invasion is still played and there is still a community of modders for the game too (people who modify the game to enhance or add to the original to make for an even better gaming experience) which just shows how popular it is. In fact a brilliant Rome Total War mod called Viking Invasion II has recently been released which shows the legacy and longevity of the original game.I played the game some time after it came out - and after i had played its successor, Rome Total War, and yet it still engaged me. It focuses on an area which many strategy games leave alone, the Viking Age of Britain. I highly recommend it. It's not got hundreds of provinces on a big map like so many modern strategy games (who ever has the time to finish those?). It's simple, fun and highly immersive - and you'll be humming the music not too long after your first game!"
5,Handy improvements to the reg. game,"The viking period is interesting for the most part. It doesn't have the depth of the regular game but has some new units that are fun to play around with. The real value of this expansion are the upgrades for regular Medieval Total War. You now have a very helpful pre-battle screen to help with reinforcement selection, sizing up the enemy, etc. There are also a lot of new units added to the game. For anyone that liked MTW this is well worth the money."
5,Total War Viking Invasion Exp Pack,"Personally I like the changes. It has improved upon what was already my favorite strategy/war game. The addition of a better pre-battle interface is nice, you can actually organize your forces better. I also like the additional unit types, helps add color and depth to the game. So far the Viking period has been a blast and the AI of the enemy generals is much improved over the the last game. They are crafty and the high level generals are definitely a challenge. Overall I can't wait for the next installment of Rome Total War. Drooling just thinking about it."
3,I Live For Frankie But The CD IS Just OK,"Truh be told I live for Frankie Knuckles and what he's has done over the years shapping House Muisc as we know now. Turth be told I even live for every last remix and production he has worked on, but Motivation aint cuttingit for me. 3 stars for a Star not the CD."
4,Gospel House Party,"Motivation is a true gem by Mr. Knuckles. He brilliantly combines the influence of gospel with the driving beat of deep house music.One can dance to it or reflect while the words of wisdom pump out of the speakers.Who says one cannot go to the club and be a spiritual person at the same time. Not Frankie Knuckles!!!!This CD is great, I would HIGHLY recommend it."
5,Music - Motivation,"Frankie Knuckles is a beast with his music and abilities. I have enjoyed listening to this one over and over. thank goodness it isn't vinyl because the tracks would have worn down by now. This is one to add to your collection, if you're so inclined."
5,Clearly the Bible of Unix - GREAT,"This is the BEST and most complete book on Programming Unix. If you're hiring an Unix developer and he doesn't own a copy of this book, he's clearly just a hack. Stevens writing style is clear, easy to read and provides alot of insight. Had a little trouble getting some of the examples to run on Linux but,learned a great deal while figuring out why. ;-)"
5,"After 10 years, it is still the best book about UNIX' API","This book is for C programmers. Though there have been many years since it appeared, it is still an invaluable book. The book is full of examples, which is considered as the best way to learn programming language and API.For an application programmer, it is important to know Unix interfaces clearly and how to use them together. There are a lot of books about Unix, but many of them describe the kernel or other things, and the manual is too large and troublesome to read. So we need the book written by Stevens, which tell you interfaces with examples."
4,The finest Unix programming book yet ?,"This book, in common with all of Stevens's works is a fine example of how to write technical literature without boring the reader.He starts with an discussion of the multitude of differing Unixes, explaining the geneology of each. Along with the work on standards, this is essential reading for any Unix user, from Wizard to Weenie.As the book progresses, he takes you through the Unix API, step by step. IO, Processes, Tasks; it's all their.If you have a more advanced understanding, you can leap to the parts you want without fear of losing the rythm of the book.The best"
5,Amazing! The BEST UNIX programming book,"This book is amazing, just like what everybody said, BUY these book, you'll be glad you did!"
5,The only book you'll ever need for Unix programming.,This book has helped me a lot in my technical career. I've used it extensively in mission critical projects. There's no way these projects would have succeeded if not for this book.
3,It's out of date but GOOOOOD.,"This book is really very out of date. Alas, Stevens is no longer with us so there won't be an updated edition that deals with pthreads and other Posix issues. There are other books for that but this book really helped ground 9/10 decent systems programmers. It's a good read, mostly for key concepts and historical perspective, however its use as a cookbook for for todays programmers is limited.Raoul-Sam"
5,Excellent for novices and advanced users alike.,"Well, this is one of those rare books (like ""Applied Cryptography"") which manages to cover all aspects of the material, but also makes it easy for novices to understand. I'd suggest having a fairly thorough background in C before you try this book. However, you don't need a deep knowledge of UNIX to understand it!After you get this book, you may want to do some socket (internet) programming. Since this book doesn't cover sockets in depth, I'd recommend (as a complement), ""UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1: Networking APIs - Sockets and XTI "" also by W. Richard Stevens."
5,Thorough coverage of the topic,"This book covers the history of SysV and BSD unix as it pertains to programming, outlines the standards used and how implementations of Unix measure up to standards, and covers the fundamentals needed to write programs for Unix. I have both the first edition and the second. I would recommend for anyone seeking to understand Unix from a programmer's perspective."
3,Not for me,"Keep in mind, this is a hormone. I had some zits a couple days into use without significant gains to justify use. It's not for me, but to each their own. I'd rather take a prohormone stack (which I'm not going to do until I cap out naturally), ideally transdermally - than take this stuff."
5,Please read all warnings for this product,"Make sure all research for this product is done BEFORE you start taking it, it does affect prescription medication if your on anything for mental or heart issues, but it does work well for those who want something more natural, it defiantly evens out hormones as well."
4,recommended,Im 55 and my testosterone levels were nearing the minimum normal level for my age and my doctor say to take these as they will help it.... given my purchase and continued use I am not sure if they work or not but that other head on my body does still wake up every morning and whenever I need it too so im sold.
1,Pill does not work.,I have been trying this pill for a week and have not notice any improvements. I have noticed that more of my hair is falling out. Some of the other reviews are not quite what they seem. This product does not do any thing that it claims to do.
1,May cause hair loss,"The price of this product is fairly low, so I thought I have nothing to lose. I was wrong.I've used DHEA for ~20 days and suddenly I realized an intensive wave of hair loss. I stopped taking it immediately and the hair loss stopped. I suggest searching for discussions of this topic online before you buy it."
1,Not sure what it's supposed to do.,"I got this because they claimed it would improve my libido. I started off taking 1 pill/day. Did that for a week. Then increased it to 2 pills/day, no difference. I have nearly finished the bottle and still no difference."
5,very pleased,Product is very good - Company is one I have purchased their products before and are of High Quality. Delivery was first class mail and very fast- would definently buy from them again.
4,seem to be working,I can't tell completely but just lets say I believe it is giving me the desired results. At the least I can say I am pleased.
1,Not for everyone,"After reading up on DHEA, I thought it was worth trying with minimum cost. After just two capsules this product caused my Prostate to swell immediately, within two days I felt a lump or pressure inside my bottom area, and had trouble urinating. I stopped using the product immediately, and my body functions seem to have returned to normal within a few days ( 3-4 ). I flushed the remaing 118 cap's down the toilet ! Sorry I tried it, I recommend you don't use if your 50+"
5,DHEA,Another good product from Swanson. Have heard negative things about this product however I have not experienced any of the side effects from using this produc which are causing concern to make the legislators want to regulate this product as a steroid.
4,Becareful... but works,This stuff makes me feel 10 years younger (maybe more). But I get REALLY angry when I am on it. I was taking 1 a day. I needed to go down to 1 every 3 days.
4,swanson dhea,"been taking this for a couple weeks now and it seems to be improving my mood. Im substantially more positive then in recent weeks and helps with my get-up-and- go. So far so good!Update: This stuff is impressive. My short term memory is getting better and better each week. I dont forget tasks that im supposed to do. I almost never lose anything like keys, paperwork."
1,heart problems,I have taken DHEA before but this one causes severe problems with my heart and should not be sold any where until it is proven safe to use. I have use supplements for 30 years and have run into few products that are as bad as this one.
2,nothing special,"no noticeable effects. pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for. don't think this is what got lance armstrong in trouble."
1,Newest rip off from Asylum,"I bet guestar57 will soon write a positive review here, I guess the Invasion of the Body Snatchers remake (Invasion) must be set to come to theaters soon. Dont be fooled by this garbage."
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"I saw this movie advertised in SFBC for $9.99. I have always been a fan of the body snatcher movies, so I decided to try it out. It's not worth the $9.99 price let alone the higher price advertised here. I almost turned it off after 5 minutes into the movie. It was a long 80 minutes that I could have done something else. The new pod people seemed to become lesbians after the transformation, if they were women, but even these scenes were horrible. I wished I had read the reviews here beforehand."
4,"Good Read, Enjoyable & Insightful","This was a very interesting book and a good read. However, if you are looking for a primer on art theory, then you need look elsewhere. This gives some insight into the general art theories of the past and today but it isn't organized like a textbook. Instead it has a more meandering structure that makes it more interesting but less instructional. All in all though, I really enjoyed it. The only thing I truly didn't like was that it gave very short shrift to some media that are only the line between craft and art. That would have seemed to be a very good topic for inclusion. But still a good book."
4,What about nobrow art?,"On the subject of art (or should it be Art?): Freeland's book is a good and relevant treatment of the issue, low of jargon and high on no nonsense sociology. I was surprised, however, to see no treatment of the historical rise of ""nobrow"" artistic culture and no philosophical and socio-aesthetic analysis of the phenomenon. In general there was almost no analysis of literature/literary fiction. C'mon, art is not equivalent to the visual culture. Let me just say that this astonishing gap is filled by a magnificent book by Peter Swirski 'From lowbrow to nobrow' which I heartily recommend to those who finished 'But is is art' feeling only partly sated."
2,Not for people who appreciate good ropework,"There were probably half a dozen photos with compelling ropework; otherwise they're photos of women with rope draped over them and a few Lark's Heads on their arms & legs. The secondary theme for the book could be ""Unrealized Potential"" as there are so many missed opportunities for visually-interesting ties.The photos are well done from a technical standpoint, but offer very little from an aesthetic standpoint."
5,The most useful pipettes,"The product is very useful because it is made of plastic, so when someone is using this, you cannot break it. And the top part is of plastic instead of rubber, thus it is more effective for the use.This is a great purchase!!"
2,Good and bad,"In his enlightening introduction, Horvat says, ""The faces which attract me rarely resemble those I am asked to photograph for fashion magazines.""The pages that follow contain photographs of interesting faces he has selected himself. But Horvat's approach is flawed and the really excellent photographs number only a precious few.Horvat's pictures look best when he keeps it simple and he allows those faces he loves to shine through. Too often, however, he seems unable to escape the influences of fashion photography, overwhelming and encumbering his subjects with distracting gawdy period costumes.Horvat's use of color and light results in truly luscious photographs, and the reproductions in this volume are quite good. In my opinion, the book is worth buying just for what is good here."
3,Factual Error!,"There is a major (to me) factual error in this book. In describing St. Mary's Catholic Cathedral in its 1992 edition (I hope it has been corrected by now)Baedecker says that the church was built on the site of ""a grocery store."" It was NOT built on the site of a grocery store, but on the site of my former high school, St. Vincent's School, which had been there since 1938.Otherwise, this seems a nice pictoral review of major sites in San Francisco."
1,Blasphemous... What a joke!!!,"One star really is too generous a rating for this waste of disc space. If anyone doubts Cher's talent and/or vocal abilities, this is a disc to hear. TRIBUTE?"
5,Could not be better!,"This is an excellent set of cookware. Rugged, sturdy, and well-built. The only down side for me is the fact that they are not dishwasher friendly. I will definitely buy more Simply Calphalon."
2,Poor Customer Service,"Poor customer Service!When we bought this set a few years back it seemed very well built. In general, the set as a whole was really good. However, over time, one of our pans was losing it's nonstick. Since it had a 10 year warranty (which is why we bought the set), we called up the customer service. They were insistent we pay for the shipping and insurance (for that price we might as well buy a new pan...definitely not calphalon though).The eventually paid for all shipping costs for THEIR defective product. The representative was rather rude and obnoxious about it though. I have never seen such poor example of customer service from a supposed ""reputable"" company like calphalon. At least Kitchen Aid doesn't give you any hassle.When this set wears out...which I am sure it will....I will never go back to Calphalon, they are overrated and overpriced with terrible customer service."
5,Super quality and love this cookware!,"As an ordinary person who only cooked to eat, not for pleasure, I am amazed at how this cookware has me actually loving to cook! I now can't wait to get out the cookware and try a new recipe. I am very pleased with the quality as well and the difference in the overall cooking and baking experience with this brand. Food seems to have more flavor, cleanup is a breeze, even having to handwash the cookware. Having bought those average Wal Mart brand pots and pans for almost thirty years having these to cook with everyday is a new pleasure! This set and the bakeware set were my 28th wedding anniversary present and I am glad our daughter suggested them to me from seeing them on the cooking channel. I was just about to buy anothe T Fal set from Wal Mart and am now glad I spent the extra money!UPDATE NOV. 2006 - STILL JUST LOVE MY NEW COOKWARE AND BAKEWARE!!!! STILL A FIVE STAR PRODUCT."
2,After 4 months the teflon peeled off!,"...on two of our most used pots. We didn't use a dishwasher, we cleaned them by hand with delicate, non-corrosive soap, and always cooked with Calphalon tools.It's a shame because they cook beautifully. That is, until they die on you."
5,Great set for the money,"This was a great set for the money. By no mean is it a pro caliber, but the quality of the non-stick is excellent and we've been using it as our primary set of cookware for two years. We use the 8"" pan daily for everything from frying eggs to sauteeing onions. We are happy at having to use less oil in our cooking resulting in lighter, healthier dishes.Definitely important to follow the care instructions (no auto dishwasher, no cooking spray, usage of only wood or silicone utensils) but since we didn't want to spend $300 or more for an entire set of cookware, this has more than met our needs."
3,I want my T-Fal back!,"I have to say this set is not what I expected for such a price.The food stuck right from the beginning. The nonstick finish is also very cheap. Even with plastic utensils, the finish on my skillets started to dent and scratch. Keep in mind my set is only one month old!I know many people would say I'm crazy but, I'm going back to the T-Fal skillets I buy at Wal-mart. They are the best value for the money considering all things."
3,beautiful minatures,I love Calphalon and I was very excited to get a set for the excellent price. When the box arrived I was suspicious of the size but hey...they are professional packers. The pots were beautiful and completely inadequate for cooking for a family of four. The smallest sauce pan could barely hold a can of soup. I packed them back up (and yes they all fit back in the box again) and Amazon graciously gave me a refund. Lovely pots but not big enough.
5,I absolutely love it,I saw this Calphalon set touted by Consumer Reports on the Oprah show. I had been shopping for affordable cookware and the selection was dismal to say the least. When I received my order I was pleased by the quality and even more impressed when I actually used it. The heat distribution was great. The care and cleanup was a snap. Forget any other cookware in this price range. This set will last you a lifetime if you take care of it.
2,Really not worth the price,"I bought the Calphalon set thinking it would be more durable and last longer than the cheaper Wearever set that it replaced. The thicker aluminum is better than most cookware but the Teflon coating really does not hold up. I used plastic Calphalon Utensils, always hand washed, used their recommended Dobie pad and still the coating is starting to come up. A friend of mine had the same problem with this set as well."
5,Joy in the kitchen,"These pots and pans will give you a new outlook on cooking and the subsequent cleanup. Easy, easy, easy. The cookware is heavy enough to do everything from omelets to fudge, and it cleans up with minimal effort. The lids are excellent also. This was a 'splurge' for me, yet it represents one of the smartest buying drecisions I've made."
4,Essential reading on KGB history,"Those of us interesting in a more complete telling of the history of Soviet intelligence operations -- and, for that matter, the history of the USSR -- can do no wrong than to read this account of secret information secretly noted by archivist Vasili Mitrokhin and spirited with Mitrokhin to Britain. While some of the passages require some previous knowledge of Soviet and KGB history, overall this book makes for fascinating reading. I could not put this book down. Thanks for Christopher Andrew for another strong effort, such as his earlier history of the KGB written with Oleg Gordievsky."
3,"Amazing, dense and packed with info","I have not finished the book yet (in the interest of being honest)...but so far its got some really interesting unheard facts. I heard the author on the NPR and what he said (about the sequel) was some really interesting, amazing facts about the KGB....unfortunately the book is more dense and layered down with codename after codename and I think a lot gets lost as a result. However, the intent was to release EVERYTHING that Mitrokhin smuggled out so thats what they did....if you can sit threw a lot of stuff, there are real nuggets of gold here."
2,A book only a historian could love,"Though I am interested in geopolitics, this is not an easy read. The sheer weight of names, faces, events tends to drag one down. I suppose if I wanted fast-paced espionage, I should read a novel. I did find some parts of this book, particularly the revelations about KGB infiltration into the highest reaches of the White House at certain points in time, interesting. Frankly, I am surprised at the level of ineptness of the intelligence services on both sides. The end game of the fall of Communism was covered in fairly short order - I expect this will be the subject of the next volume by the authors, though if it is very much like this one, I doubt I will be reading it."
5,Real,"Well, this is the real facts, is not a story , is real life, this book is not about the agents some have in their mind from the movie industry's prections of the handsome athletic agent who is "" good to the bone"". This book shows the truth and explains what happened and why, it might not be too much impressionism but it gives what was going on behind the scene. The truth is always good to know, this is the book on the subject that gets as close as possible. The book can be opened at any page and is still captivating to read."
1,I think reading this book was a complete waste of my time.,"Sometimes one picks up a book, thinks it looks interesting, and decides to buy it and read it, only to find out that you wish you hadn't. This is the way I feel about this book. I think this book is absolute blasphemy, and think it never should have come into existence!"
4,"Good look at KGB, but . . .","This book is essential reading for those who want to learn about the strange world of international espionage. Mitrokhin's archives, assuming their authenticity, solve a lot of old puzzles of the Cold War spying game. My greatest reservation about the book concerns Andrew's interpretations of the KGB material. He assumes throughout that the KGB's leaders were a pack of paranoids and that Americans were largely innocent of adverse designs against the USSR. In fact we won't know the whole story of Cold War espionage until we learn more about what remains concealed in the vaults of the U.S. and U.K. security services."
3,very technical,I enjoyed the book very much-- but there are a lot of details and names and acronyms that make for very dry reading--
5,A great Cold War history,This book is a very clearly and interestingly written history of that part of the Cold War that does not normally appear in the media. There is a wealth of detail that will come as a surprise to many who have witnessed the events of the last half-century and wondered why some events have transpired.
3,Only half the story,A very interesting insight into the methods used by one society to disrupt another. But the book and its publicity comes with the self-righteous feel of the victor. Perhaps when an American comes forward with similarly credible information we will get a fuller picture of the role intelligence agencies had in the Cold War era.
4,Good Service,The book received within the promised time and in conditions as advertised. Good service!
2,Better read than heard,"A lot of detail, and all of it good information. Unfortunately it should not be presented in audio format without a rewrite. It gets difficult when listening to the tape while navigating traffic and having to navigate the acronyms of the various spy agencies."
3,The KGB Archives,"Mitrokhin & Andrews' book is just as described: an archive of information. As such, it is packed with information that the authors have tried to organize into something of a dry narrative. That said, this volume and its successor, ""The World Was Going Our Way,"" contain a plethora of details on KGB tactics and experiences from WWII onwards.What it doesn't contain is a good deal of information about NKVD operations prior to WWII. There are brief descriptions of a handful of operations, and a general outline of the organizations history and structure, but, as the title advertises, this is a work on the KGB and the KGB alone.Andrews should be commended for making what I'm sure were dry and, at times, likely unreliable reports into a working narrative.NOTE: The rating above should read four stars rather than three."
4,Don't make them like they used to,"I didn't start liking Bonecrusher until I saw the film. Although his screentime was brief, it was the most memorable. The toy itself is pretty good. The vehicle mode has a working claw which turns into spinning blades. He looks fearsome in robot mode. I think the designers wanted these robots to look as alien as possible. My only gripe with this and other Transformers recently is that the craftsmanship has taken a dip. I'm not talking about the parts that were designed to pop off and snap back into place. I'm referring to the quality of the plastic and how delicate you have to be to transform them. What's odd is that the smaller mini versions are more durable then their deluxe counterparts."
1,DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM.,"This album is a major disappointment. It makes me wonder what they were thinking.Sure it's not the original artists, but if it's done right, it wouldn't matter. They had 2 other albums which came before this and they were all remixed. Those weren't so disappointing(Dance Mix Hits 99's the best IMO), but THIS ISN'T EVEN REMIXED. Tearin' up my heart is remixed, but a sound-alike can be heard on 100% Euro Dance Hits #3(which wasn't too good either), And Give It To You's remixed, but I thought by the title of the 'artist'(Solo Kid), it was a cover of Jordan Knight's hit; it wasn't. Probably a cover of another song I haven't heard of before.If I wanted something that sounded like the originals, I'd get the originals!I would prefer Dance Mix Hits 99 or even Dance Mix Hits 98 to this sad addition. I wonder if they're still making any more..."
1,don't be fooled,the size of this product was the size of a bottle cap. you can buy cocoa butter and get better results. Don't waste your money!
5,greatest item,Think I got the last 4 jars of this great butter for feet. Heard something about it being discontinued. Hope not
5,Dolly (and Girlfriend) are great magazines (Australia),"Dolly is a fantastic magazine. The stories and issues covered are relevent and interesting. It is filled with quizzes, celebrity gossip, clothes, makeup, advice and interviews.As for the ""cult following""; I respect your opinion but totally disagree. Dolly is nothing but a great magazine.Go to ""ninemsn.com.au/dolly"" to see more about the magazine."
5,Incredibly Inspiring,I found this book to be just what I needed to snap out of the anxiety ridden rut I was in. I recommend it to anyone who is feeling sorry for themselves or are taking life too seriously.
4,A lot of fun to read even when she turns serious.,"I leave the reviewing to more eloquent readers. All I want to contribute is one short comment: On page 77 of Loretta's otherwise wise book, Dr. Benson's technique of triggering the relaxation response is being praised. Come on, Loretta! If said ""invention"" had indeed worked beyond filling this guruh's wallet, who would be in need for listening to a bellylaugh - creator like you? I for one had my best laughs when I read this nonsensical comment."
1,her heart's in the right place....,"...but I couldn't wait for this book to be over. Her blanket statements in each chapter really got on my nerves, i.e. ""Food has almost become poison in our society. We never come home to great smells simmering on the stove anymore."" How does she know this? Or, ""now it's always the phone or the answering machine. People get home and head right for the machine."" Um, maybe it's because we want to hear who called? Loretta says she ""finally realized that trying to be thin is at odds with my Sicilian roots."". Hm...sounds like she just doesn't want to cut back her food portions and exercise more. Her life seems to have been really messed up, and it seems like she overcame her obstacles with her brand of ""humor"", but her writing did not inspire me, and her ""hilarious"" stories didn't make me laugh. One star."
2,Tedious and Inconsistent,"I didn't find this audio book to be very informative. The anecdotes were out of place and long, and her suggestions were too vague with no recommendations on how to follow them. How do you live as if your glass if full? Who knows? Also, her voice gave me a headache."
1,A Bore,Loretta is very funny and worth watching on TV. The tapes just don't make it. I have yet (6 mos after purchase) to get through the second one.
5,new thoughts need new ways,"Mysteries or secrets, esoterical practices and opinions, Aliens and invasions - we are rightfully sceptical, above all if someone believes to detect a global connection in so many things and formulates its own theory. We should not believe everything.But in a time of enormous changes it is more than helpful to see, that our strange perception is not only an illusion. It is of course a new way to see and to handle our life but it is a way which contains self-determination, joy of live and so much love. And after all it gives a suggestion to take all those in our daily life. Tru or not, if we all can live a life under these conditions, - what else could we still require? And what more could we be than our true and inner self?!If we look up to new ways we should also be ready to think in a new type."
5,GREATEST GRIDDLE,I've ordered and added other pieces to my Calphalon kitchen collection and there is nothing but praises for the quality of their products. IT COOKS GREAT!!!
5,God Knows You're Stressed,"Book used in women's book club for summer reading with tremendoussuccess. Honest presentation by author with wonderful humor.Almost everyone identified with every situation. Suggestedsolutions are realistic, doable and were received with enthusiasm. Members age range 30 to 90 years, married, divorced, widowed and single--how to live a less stressful life had application for all! One can just imagine what an insightfulpersonal counselor the author is."
3,ok,"I was looking for more of a spiritual book regarding stress, this ending up feeling more like a basic self-help book."
2,"found it boring, to be honest","I was sadly disappointed by this book - found it boring. You CAN write in the Steampunk vein in a more exciting way - Jules Verne managed to do it, along with various more contemporary authors. If this had really happened, no one would be scared by a nuclear weapon!"
4,I'm glad I sought this one out,Had to get a copy from the State Library. I liked very much the way the author played it straight and didn't try to be all Clever and everything. I get a favorable impression of the author's personality from reading this novel.
3,Still Want More,"This was the first book I bought on pregnancy fitness. I found the information to be good, but not really informative. I felt that several topics were touched on, but I was not satisfied from my reading of any of them, and I still felt I had more questions after reading each section. I didn't feel that I was learning anything new that wasn't available in any other general pregnancy book. I returned it and got the Birgitta Gallo book instead, and I have found her book to be extremely informative and helpful and expect to be using it as a guide for many months to come!"
4,Gripping and Realistic,"This is a very gripping, realistic story about a young Italian boy whose mother puts him on a ship to America in 1892. Beniamino thinks his mother is on the ship, in a different part: but she isn't. She has deliberately sent him off on his own to find a better life. The search for this life turns out to be difficult as Beniamino learns to live on the streets and in the immigrant communities of New York City. One of the things that keeps Beniamino alive is his desire to get back to his mother in Italy. But life in America changes the young boy, and he never returns. The ending is, though sad, realistic and believable in every sense."
5,What I've been missing,"Generally I don't read children's fiction, and I only got this book to satisfy my adult librarian daughter who suggested I would like it. She was certainly right. I don't know what I thought authors were putting into children's books, but I was surprised to find not only excellent writing, but a great story here. I am so glad to know that such books are not watered down to all sunshine and lolly pops. The young boy who finds himself thrust into this country alone in the early twentieth century faces hardships and heartbreak and lives to overcome these trials of life. There are lessons to be learned here and what a find place to get them--in a good book. I highly recommend this one."
4,Legit,"Just watched the DVD been a fan for years, finally something that appreciates bizzy bone and gives credit deserves. Very good in all ways definitely recommend to true fans"
5,Buy this if you love Bizzy!,This DVD provided great insight into Bizzzy's style. It has awesome footage of his shows and backstage scenes too. And it was cool to hear some of his thoughts on hip hop in the interviews. The Celebration is a definite must have for any fan of Bizzy Bone. I was 110% satisfied with this!
3,not happy,the picture shows the calcium perch in white colour and that was the main reason i purchased from this seller but the calcium perch i received was a purple. i ve been traying diffrent coloured calcium perch which i noticed the parrots get scared from them and they do not like to step on them. the seller should either show the colour of the calcium perch hes selling or if he have diffrent coloures availabe he should ask you to choose which coloure you prefer.i purchased seven of them and i think they are useless to my parrot.eitherwise shipping was quick and everything was fine.
2,NOT the same as the Panasonic fellas...,"Hey guys,These batteries are NOT the same quality as the Panasonic factory batteries. In the field the HVX220AP's we use can last about 2-3X longer on the Panasonic battery than these guys.Also irritating is the battery drain (decay time frame) itself. With the Panasonic, it's a fairly even drain, so you can look at the indicator in the viewer and what the battery says it has it has.With these, you go from FULL to EMPTY pretty fast, the drain during the lower battery life is faster than the Panasonic.They were an interesting alternative, but I don't use them anymore if I can just use the Panasonic's."
2,Monty Roberts extols the virtues of Monty Roberts,"This book would be much more believable if it had been written by someone else--or if Mr. Roberts had not tried so deperately to convince readers that he is truly a ""horse whisperer""--or, better yet as he would have us to believe--one who listens to horses. I'm unconvinced that much of this is true. END"
5,Monty Roberts: Real Horse Whisperer,"This documentary is a very touching review of how Mr. Roberts learned the secrets of equine communication, and an even more touching revelation of how that language connects man and horse. As Mr. Roberts learned, he applied the principles to communication with troubled children and got the same touching and astounding results. God has blessed this man!!"
1,Only kids and novices are impressed.,Round penning is useful for some horses but is contraindicated for others.Only kids and novices and the extremely gullible are impressed by Monty's stuff. The rest of us have seen and used round penning long before Monty became an international superstar through the use of modern media.[...]
5,Give Me a Break!,Monty has nothing but the best in mind for these horses. I don't care if he is making money from his books and videos. Would anyone do this for free? I doubt it. The critics giving reviews must not be true horse lovers or they would support any non-violent methods for working with these beautiful animals. I wish there were more people in the world who see horses the way he does. Horses are not the mindless creatures people make them out to be and I think Monty's methods prove that.
4,Good line of pans,"For over a year I've had several size of these pans. They have good weight and balance, are very easy to clean quickly, and are reasonably priced.Regarding the dishwasher, I have put some of the smaller pans in there, however I've found that since these are so easy to clean because of the nonstick surface, it's easier and faster to do it by hand -- about as quick to wash by hand as it is to load into the dishwasher and unload later -- plus then you've used up a lot of room that could be used for other things, especially with the 12"" pan.Before purchasing, I considered the tri-ply pans, however the handles were terrible, especially when trying to hold the additional weight. Plus they are much more expensive.I'd definitely recommend this pan to anyone - great product and good price."
5,great shirt,I wear it all the time. It's made well and has held up to repeated washings and wearings without any difficulty. Very comfortable and stylish.
5,Worthy of your attention,This film is incredibly moving and educational. It does a nice job of educating the viewers about the situation in Sudan while inspiring action and at the very least the reminder that each single person can make a positive impact on the lives of others. Even the jaded might agree. A definite must see!
5,"Buy this video, you git!","Great stuff here. All 3 of the Ripping Yarns vids are excellent, & this, the first, is the strongest. Tomkinson's Schooldays & Golden Gordon are 2 of my favourite episodes from the series, & Escape From Stalag Luft 112B is right up there, too. Check it out."
3,not up to snuff,"This faberware product disappointed me in that the mixing blades are not easily removed, and not always dependable for staying secure. Other than that the performance is just ordinary."
5,One of the best,"One of the best architectural histories ever, written by one of the most respected historians. Spiro Kostof was a Professor in the School of Architecture at UC Berkeley, and was much-admired by students and colleagues. This book is required reading in many schools of architecture."
2,Probably won't use this seller again.,"I purchased a book from the seller and my order has not been shipped, almost a week later.. A little disappointed since I always purchase my school books from amazon and I have not run into any problems until now. I sent an email to the seller hopefully I receive a response in a timely manner."
2,manifesting abundance,was disappointed. felt this was 'clips' of speeches made by the writer. did not even get through the first CD. Was hoping for the spirituality without the religion.
2,Too preachy.,"The fact that Ms. Williamson follows the ""christian"" path is patently obvious by the attitude in her talk. Not counting the numerous prayers that listeners are forced to listen to.She has some deffinate opinions against white magic. I feel sorry for ""christians"" that are afraid to consciously use the power of their own mind (a gift; given to us by our Creator).I have taken the pagan path (American Indian Spirituality) and I see it as a duty to develop the powers that Great Spirit gave me to the best of my ability.If you have questions or comments; E-Mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
4,"Promising Skeleton, Awaiting the Flesh","These guys are going to do it, they are going to make a full on non-stop sonic shuffle monsterpiece, and this release hints at it. A little less cheeky priggishness (confounded Aphex Twin) and they'll be right over the top. A lot of weird elements, slide guitar and such bumping into electrons bumping and burping, freaky vocals recorded through the shower door, etc., etc., An extra 1/2 star for the cover art."
1,"This book is a farce, full of errors and miscomceptions","This book has many errors, misconceptions, and shows a lack of understanding of the time value of money principles. Thomsett uses the erroneous sinking fund formula for annuity due problems. He thinks the internal rate of return (IRR)is a method that is inexact and requires many assumptions when in fact it is a staple of the financial community that is precise, there are no assumptions, and it is a valuable tool. He simply does not understand the internal rate of return method.His method of calculating the rate of return of mutual funds is a erroneous cook book method, and his example of how to calculating the rate of return of a mutual fund is a factor of 10 in error.Anyone reading this book will not learn the subject, and should be totally confused by the erroneous approach and examples provided by the book. It is amazing that any publisher would publish this book."
3,Not your average traveler,"Haffar leads the reader on an enviable trip to amazing place after amazing place. I enjoyed the introduction to unfamiliar locales, but wished he had left out his often cutting humor in favor of more insights into the cultures. His view of the countries he visits is often from the executive suite of a hotel, making his commentary somewhat superficial. An entertaining read, but not a trip for ordinary working mortals."
4,Delightful!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this creative travel journal. He had me laughing out loud with some of his witty descriptions of the places they traveled through,and the people they encountered. I highly recommend it!"
2,Didn't work to well.,Didn't touch two small grease ports. There is very little documentation and what is there is sparse at best. It did free up a clogged port on the old lawn mower though.
5,Remember your first search for buried treasure?,"Adventure Time's ""Dreams of Water Themes"" is a fantastic effort from Dublab wunderkinds Frosty and Daedelus. The duo draws from an impressive set of samples to piece together a very creative yet cohesive picture. ""Age of Aquariums"" is a nice beginning to the fun that lies ahead. Some other standouts include ""Water Signs"" and ""Hypnotized Arms"" though the entire album is top notch. This album is very fun but respectable, for myself it tended to conjure up images in vain of the cover. For example: Eel Sand Witch I likened to a tune pirates might celebrate a major score to! Anyway bizarre imagery aside this album is a very good choice for fans of turntablism, sample based music, inventive electronic music, instrumental hip-hop and just plain ol' curious souls. I definitely recommend you dig up this treasure if your in the mood for some inventive beats!"
3,The begin of the anarchy and tough jokes!,"Rik Mayall starred in the Young Ones as the nerdy and sometimes real dirty Rick. Politically incorrect in his role as a right- wing geek, he returned years later in Bottom. In this series he played again a dirty nerd who lives together with a just as much crazy friend. Again absurd humor, violent jokes but yet entertaining and always the stories end with a (sick) twist! Unfortunately the movie Guesthouse Paradiso isn't released on DVD (yet or for good! ) so we'll have to enjoy this flashback. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO! (buy the complete series instead! )"
3,"Not for everyone, but still worth reading","i received this book from a friend not expecting a whole lot from it. but to my amazement i found it refreshing. this is, imho, a collection of well written essays. it is, in some ways, an uncontrived look into the minds and personal thoughts of writers. through his 'dead cat, floating boy' essay, which i found to be the most entertaining, i was introduced to john barth (i am now reading 'the sot-weed factor'). the central theme being 'who are we and where are we going?', it is a collection of modern essays for modern times."
2,Rather decorative acounts on enormous issues.,"The book's title raised my expectations unjustly. I was expecting powerful essays like James Baldwin's ""The Fire Nextt Time,"" but remained unfullfilled. Perhaps it a sad byproduct of progress that writers see it fit to deal with such enormous issues with very short accounts that go deeply into personal experince, but shamelessly gloss over the depth of enormous events. These are mentioning in grossly conventinal terms."
4,Great tool,I install X-ray equipment. This tool is great. I have to center equipment mounted on the cieling to a floor plate. This makes it effortless and accurate.
1,Calphalon should be ashamed...,"Calphalon should be ashamed to lend name to this product. I have owned other Calphalons. Thinking this would be the same, but boy was I wrong. From construction, to how long long it lasts, you name it, it's just bad. It's really a cheap product with the Calphalon name. Stay away from ""Simply Calphalon""."
5,Everything you need,"I finally figured out why I just can't stop listening to this record. There are so many records in my collection that have one or two great tunes. And then there are a few dozen perfect album sides. But there's a relatively short list of records that I can throw in the player without needing to keep the remote nearby to skip over the occasional dud. This record definitely makes that shortlist.Whether it's the Beatlesk pop tunes like ""Let me down easy"" and ""Rumor"" or sadder sweeter tunes like ""On this perfect day"" or ""Clutch"", all the songs hit the mark both in their own right and as an outstanding collection of tunes."
4,Track List is Switched,Amazon has the track list for this CD wrong. The tracks listed here as of 12/11/07 are actually for This Soft Life.
5,Awesome,Great CD; I can't take it out of the player. The mix of good old hard rockin' and very catchy songwriting. Holds up very well to repeated listening. Warning: highly addictive.
5,review,This is an excellent rendition of the classic tale of POLLYANNA. It is vibrant and well performed with much more depth than the Disney version. ENJOY!!!
1,Fraudulent Advertising,"Bic Supply Item 2A1500PABLU 48QT BLUE COOLER: The Amazon.com picture shows a BLUE cooler!There were multiple lies about this item:Amazon.com, Bic Supply's agent, advertised a BLUE cooler.Amazon.com's order confirmation clearly states that item number 2A1500PABLU 48QT BLUE COOLER had been ordered.Amazon.com's shiping notification states that Bic Supply had shipped 2A1500PABLU 48QT BLUE COOLER.Bic Supply's packing list clearly shows that Bic Supply had shipped item number 808245 48 QT BLUE COOLER as promised.The item received was RED. Bic Supply advertised and promised a BLUE cooler.So far, Bic Supply has not promptly responded to a return request.The product itself is great but why send a red one when the customer ordered the advertised blue one???"
2,Just flat out disappointment,"When will the makers of mk realize that you cant make an identical game to inferior systems and still expect people to buy it. If you're gonna make mk for the dc, make it spectacular. I got rid of the 64 because I wasn't totally pleased with the game selection and quality. I see now that there will never be another mk game that i'll be buying for a system. Oh yeah, and i'm begging someone to make the game just that much harder. It's not even fun on two player. But once again, thank the man upstairs for refunds and exchanges."
3,Basically MK4 for Dreamcast,"If you allready own Mortal Kombat 4 for Playstation or N64, then there really is no reason to own this unless your a die hard MK fan. This game is essentially MK4 with added characters and much better graphics. One of the first games released for the Dreamcast."
2,What a dissapointment!,"MKG isn't a bad game...For Supernintendo. The graphics are alright, until you see their shadows are stick people. The stories are extremely weak. The gameplay is redundant. The videos at the end of the game play like you just drew them. It's really bad.The only very redeeming value of this game are the move. The are something else. However, they cannot save the game.Every so often I like to play this game, but not because it's great, just because my Sega doesn't work, and that's the only other copy of MK I have."
2,NOT A VERY GOOD GAME.,"When I saw this game in a Dreamcast magazine, I thought it would be cool. But It was just like Mortal Kombat 4. And I don't like Mortal Kombat 4 very mutch. So the only new things about this game are the few new characters, the few new places to fight, and the kombat theater.(which is just the endings of the game you've seen.)All that stuff gets boring very quickly. So I'm glad I rented this game, or else I'd be stuck with it."
2,Mortal Kombat Gold is a Boring summer re-run,"Its not that mk gold is a bad game and all, but as far as Franchises go, its just about run its course. MK gold is basically MK4 with 5 new charactors, and once thats over with your stuck with a game that you were finished playing on the nintendo 64 and playstation a year ago. It does look much better than the arcade and the gameplay is exacly the same, but its to old of a game to come out now. It would be like releasing a new virsion of Mortal Kombat 1 on the playstation. If you have never played MK4 before, then you should rent it and see if its your thing or not, but otherwise steer clear and buy soul calibur instead."
2,MK 4 all over again (LOGO) SMK review,"This game is a waste of money! If you have MK 4 don't get this game! It's lowsy and is pretty much and updated version of MK4.Some thing's you might enjoy is that you can be Baraka and Mileena in this version. Good game to rent bad game to buy,enough said! If you would like to see any of my other reviews just look for my logo which is SMK that might be at the top or bottom of the review.OUT!(LOGO) SMK"
1,hmmm I wish I could fit all the problems in here.,"Has anyone noticed how All the charicters pratcilly have a way of moven?Cyrax will move just like Sonya. Scorpion and Subzero and Jax Well Just about everyone has a duplicate animated action's and puches and kicking. They are all the same animations really and that really brings the game down.The Shadow's are nothin but stick people.lame lame lame.and the super powers looked Better in Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 2 and Mortal Kombat 3. look how stupid Lue Kang's Fire is now. just a little tiny ball...ahhh plan and simple this game sucks. If your a die HARD Mortal Kombat fan, YOU MIGHT! like it... but there is also a chance you might hate it. But as for a fighter... If You are REALLY looking for a fighter, Don't even think about buying this game. if your gonna buy it, buy it for like 1- to 5 dollars at the most. I payed 26.99 for it..... and Not worth any of the money I put to it. Kitana doesn't even have the same appeal she had in Mortal Kombat 2."
2,Don't waste your cash on this,"There are other games far better for the Dreamcast than this game. It doesn't even have a practice mode or anything else to make it stand out. Gameplay is very shallow and ultimately boring. If you get more than 3 or 4 hours of game playing enjoyment out of this more power to you. There are many other games that are less expensive and much better available. Instead of wasting your money on this go try Soul caliber, marvel vs Capcom, DOA2 or Virtua Fighter. All are much better games that include many extras not available in the arcade version. Soul Caliber for the Dreamcast is fantastic by the way and costs less. If you don't believe me go rent Mortal Kombat Gold and see for yourself. This is easily the worst Mortal Kombat ever."
5,A Treasuretrove of Olde Recipes Found in an Olde Attic,"A nice book that resembles an old ""redback speller.I am looking to collect at least four more of these books"
3,Classy and Smooth,"Without a doubt ""Big Game"" is the best track on this album with my man Vast Aire featuring. Main problem with this album is that it doesnt feel finished. The last 3/4s of the album besides ""747 Flyin"" and ""Leaving"" aren't up to scratch. I'll give it 3 stars because there are a good handful of great tracks on this album which is more than I can say for half of the stuff currently out there at the moment but on a general scale of things this album could of been much better."
4,Simple but pleasing for a small child.,"Each picture has from one to four words describing it - from boarding to landing a plane, from the viewpoint of one watching, not riding. My son has every page memoraized! This is a good, simple book for a toddler who likes planes. There is not much 'meat' to the book; it's not meant to educate about planes or dazzle with rhythm or rhyme."
5,The illustrations alone make this book worth buying,Even if this book didn't have any text it would still be a great children's book. Donald Crews is one of the best children's book illustrators ever! The great illustrations combined with the simple text make this a perfect book for preschool aged children.
4,So adorable but small,"I love the idea of these strings of garland with bud vases. In person they are even a bit smaller than I expected. I'm also not sure how practical these are when using water and having to clean them, but great for an interesting conversation starter. Definitely a statement piece- unique."
5,A Great Devotion Book,Finally! A devotion book our whole family looks forward to reading! The stories are fast-paced and very inspiring. They've led to some great discussions.
4,interesting reading,"This is a really good book, especially for family time and for helping children understand that the Christian life is not problem free, but we have God's help at all times."
1,Poor video quality,"The video and audio of this recording are so poor that it would be impossible to watch this DVD for more than a few seconds. The opening black and white video footage was poorly copied from a possibly damaged tape source, so there is a bluish tinge in a spiral pattern that creates an almost psychedelic visual effect. This caused a headache for me, and I'm convinced it would do the same for other viewers. The last recording on the film has the audio so totally out of sync with the video that it's impossible to tolerate watching it. This is most unfortunate, because the content of the speeches are worth hearing, but not through this production."
5,Excellent saucepan!,"I've been buying different saucepans (since I use them often)to see which one I like the best-and this is it. It's the sturdiest,shaped the best and cleans up the EASIEST. The others I have are: All Clad(not worth the price), Wolfgang Puck(verygood)and Cuisinart(very good). This only refers to saucepans,though."
1,I do not like being lied to!,"I purchased this product line in a retail store. The packaging clearly states it is dishwasher safe. Then after you unpack it, and read that if you put it in the dishwasher you void the ten year warranty! Do not make the same mistake I did, avoid this product."
4,Hot and compeling.,"I love Emma Hollys books. She is very explicit in her writing but not held back by the usual boundaries of a romance novel. I like how she is direct and bold. I like how she can make those scences just as hot if not hotter then the usual sex scene. This was a really good book. It has the hot sex and a good plot. Although the plot was not real aparent in the begining, it came out and was quite a gripping story. I did not give it 5 stars because it could have used a little more plot in ratio to the sex scenes. In no way a disapointment. Highly recommended."
4,HOT!!,"This book will make you so hot, your husband or boyfriend will love you! Probably one of her sexist books, with a few interesting twists. If you are an Emma Holly fan, you will love this book."
2,"Not enough plot, not enough hot!","I didn't enjoy this book as much as I have Emma's books for Red Lace. The plot didn't engage me much at all, and I didn't find the erotic scenes to be up to Holly's previous levels of 'hottitude', though of course this is a highly personal call. :-) Good characterizations, but it wasn't enough to compensate for what I feel were other weaknesses in the book. I'll read other Emma HOlly titles, but this one didn't do it for me."
2,Over the tipping point from erotica to porn,"I generally enjoy erotica, even books that include m/m/f ménage which may put off some readers. The primary problem with this book is that the characters are shallow and overly promiscuous. Two of the four characters appear confused about their sexual orientation. Why is this a problem for liberated women and men who enjoy this type of novel? Simple. It's just not sexy when a couple that's falling in love stumble across a man-boy cruising for sex in a graveyard and have him introduce the hero to his first homosexual experience - which the hero loves. See other reviews for more details.I like a good erotic read as much as the next person and appreciate an unconventional twist. Inevitably those kinds of books offer a satisfying read that leaves me caring about the characters. This book left me feeling slightly icky."
1,Nasty and Unromantic,"I read Catching Midnight and Hunting Midnight. CM was ok but HM was great. I also read Beyond Innocence and Beyond Seduction both were superb. Except, I hated that Nic had previously had some kind of relationship with Sebastian. I like my men to be All Man. This book was gross. Man anal. I stopped reading it."
5,Erotic romance,"No one does it like Emma Holly. She really is the only author I've ever read who can neatly balance hot, hot sex and realistic characters and relationships without sacrificing either one. Bea and Phillip, Bea's best friend and her lover, Simon are all superbly drawn. The sex scenes are all spicy and scorching (make the appropriate preparations beforehand), but none are really gratuitous. Each develops an aspect of personality or connection that keeps the reading of PERSOANL ASSESTS from feeling hollow."
4,Great low price bike tent,"This is a great low price, light weight Bike or Canoe tent. Definately worth consideration."
5,blow it up,"for any history buffs who is into studying african liberation history, this book is a must. get it while you can.."
5,timmons ahead of his time,Bobby Timmons has the simplicity of Ahmad Jamal and the groove of Herbie Hancock. This album is a masterpiece. Timmons might be one of the most overlooked of all pianists.
2,Not that Good as Wee Sing Togather,"It has few songs, which runs for about 30-35 mins or so. Tape runs for about 55 min. Story is slow and boring so are the most of the songs. I have 19-month-old baby and he doesn't like this Video as much as he likes Wee Sing Together and other Barney Tapes."
5,STILL WATCH IT!!,"I am the Anonymous Wee Singer, and if you haven't heard of me before you MUST go to my Musical Mansion reviews and hear of me. Yes, this one was one I saw too when I was little, and as I very much do all Wee Sing movies, I recommend this one to people. Only this one plays nursery rhymes, but instead of just ""singing"" them into the camera, Wee Sing puts it into a storyline! Jack and Jill, Mary, and Little Boy Blue go to King Cole's castle for a party, while at the castle are his servants Polly and Sukki and his entertainers, Jester and The Fiddlers Three (and of course, the queen!). It was a good idea to put it into a movie like that, because it keeps the kid entertained, as well as the rest!-The Anonymous Wee Singer"
2,Terminator,Other than playing capture the flag against the computer this game offers very little. I probably had enough fun with it to offset the cheap price but I would not have bought it if I knew what it was like before purchase.
5,very real story to me,"I checked this book out of the library. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read it because at the time I was suffering through my own infertility. But once I started I was hooked. I could relate to Diana so easily, the heartache that occured at the same time each month, and the feeling that there was something wrong long before I went to any doctor. Like Diana, I too was able to overcome this problem, and now have two beautiful sons (our own biological children, too!) I didn't relate quite as well to the other couples, but did find their stories facinating as well. The research Danielle Steel did was very good except for one flaw - when Pillar had her miscarriage around New Year's she was back in getting another insemination done the next month -I also had this procedure done and doctors will not do this procedure for three months after a miscarriage. Also her discription of the procedure itself was a little different than mine. But excellent reading none the less!"
4,I Loved It,I truly loved this book I'm a big D.S. fan and I've read almost all of her books. The only thing I found wrong with this book were multiple typos between chapter 20-23. (sorry the USMC has made me pay attention to details a little too much)Other than that the book kept me on my toes and to the point to where I didn't want to put it down. I liked the fact that D.S. combined three stories into one but I also think she could have gone a little more in depth with her characters to make the reading more interesting for readers that don't normally read her books and that dont understand her reading to the fullest.
4,Enjoyable,"I have been reading Danielle Steel's books for over 15 years now. Sometimes they do get a bit ""all the same"" with most of the characters being important, successful, beautiful people who live in ""stately homes"" and wear ""important jewels and furs"". Sometimes I think the characters are more about what they have then who they are. Despite this, I always enjoy her books - they are easy to read, romantic and make you forget about everyday life for a couple of hours while engrossed in the book. Personally I think her earlier books are more enjoyable and get more involved in the characters than some of the later books she has written.I could really relate to this book as when I first read it I was going through my own pregnancy dramas. Why is it stories involving pregnancy and babies always make you sob? I seemed to be crying alot in this Danielle Steel. A courageous journey for all three couples and as always a happy ending for them all. You will enjoy this one."
5,Great Product,Received the Air vents sooner than expected. Very easy installation. Took less than 20 minutes to install both units.
4,Great customer service,"We needed a vent cover for our Fantastic Fan so we could operate it when it is raining. (Fantastic Fan has a rain sensor that closes it automatically). It was delivered faster than expected.However, when I attempted to install it I noticed that there was not enough clearance for the vent to open all the way. It needed 11 inches of clearance to open all the way, but there was only 8 inches. I was concerned it might damage the vent motor if it was stopped before being completely open.I sent an e-mail to Maxair (on a Sat morning) expecting not to hear anything until at least Monday. SURPRISE! I received a phone call from them later that same day. I was assured that it would not damage the Fantastic fan, as they are designed to stop if they hit any object, such as tree limb or other object.Great folks to work with. If you ever have a problem, contact them, I am sure they will do their best to help you. I went ahead and installed it and it works great. Highly recommend it."
5,maxxair 850 white,"i wasn't sure about buying this cover, but after trying a regular cover and it not working right i spent the cash and got this , fairly easy to install and dosn't block any light from skylight in my toilet room, i would recommend."
5,"Great Book, only one question","I was reading the golden one when I thought crosses my mind. Would Elrabin meet Ampris in the arena? But as I read the second I found that untrue. My question is, in book number one it says Elrabin was sold to the Utar Dan gladitory school. How did he end up a servant for Sir Galard and the blues? That's my only question. Otherwise both books are great! I can't put them down. In Homeroom, Language Arts. You name it I read it there. Hopefully after the trilogy you will keep writing your amazing and wonderful Alien Chronicles"
1,Where's the beef?,"This book was a waste of time, not to mention money. It is full of vague generalities and is has such a sopoforic writing style that its one legitimate use might be as an insomnia remedy. There is very little concrete, useful information in this book."
5,Easy to Connect with the Author,"Dr Schwartz may have written this book over 20 years ago, but his message transends decades. Easy to swallow snippets of examples in how to improve one's life never grow old. One thing I enjoyed and you will to, is the end of chapter summaries. They each give an overview of the stories told previously and help those of us, who want to use this book as a reference in our everyday lives. This book will join my annual must read list as a refresher on how to be a better family member, mate, employee, employer and friend."
2,Definitely boring and lack substance,The book gives numerous examples to birng forward Schwartz's points which I feel were unconvincing. His arguments were not very motivating which is afterall the whole point of reading the book
5,one great pan!,"I love this pan! I have always grilled outdoors all year round, but no more. Tonight's thick hamburgers were just as good cooked on top of the stove and I was able to get the rest of the meal together without running in and out of the house. Chicken cutlets were done in minutes and delicious. And the cleanup is just as fast. I own top of the line All Clad pans but for the price this one can't be beat!"
1,Transaction was cancelled due to out of stock item.,I cannot review this product as it was out of stock. The seller refunded my money in a timely manner.
4,a good Lindsay Gordon,"I enjoyed this book because of the atmosphere, and also because you don't expect the end, which should always be the case in a good crime story.It's a nice change to read good lesbian crime story that's taking place outside the US"
4,Good but with reservations,"Yes, I did enjoy the book as I really like the Lyndsay Gordon series. My only dislike is all the wordy excerpts from the so called guide to new people at conferences. It interrupted the flow of the plot and was distracting."
3,PLEASE NOTE - this video is for MS Works 3.0,This video is for training in the MS Works 3.0 version for Windows 3.1.This video is not for Windows 95/98 users.
1,I wish I could give it -1 stars,"Do not get this book! It is confusing and boring. I had to buy this tiny book for a class taught, you guessed it, by Dr. Hall himself. It was painful and unclear (both the class and the book). Do not waste $62 on this book...unless you have to get it for the class, in which case I feel for you."
4,Sigma 100-300mm F4 - Great lens for the price.,"I bought this lens because the Canon 100-400mm was alittle to much for my pocket book. I have had the lens over 5 months and used it mostly outdoors with a monopod. A monopod is a must, Living next to Yellowstone Park I use this lens alot, however it is alittle heavy, and needs alot of light to get a perfect picture. Its not a L lens but it has its qualities that are very close, this lens doesn't get the attention it deserves for outdoor photography.If you are looking for a good F4 lens without spending over $ 900.00 this is a good alternative. If you shot in low light tripod is a must.Overall I am very happy with this lens, I would give it 5 stars if it handled low light better."
4,A Wiser Purchase is the MIDNIGHT COWBOY score,"That score, along with John Barry's original themes and Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talkin'"", includes the BEST tunes on this early Elephants Memory Buddah record, ""Old Man Willow"" and ""Jungle Gym at the Zoo.""The rest is uneventful. Not bad, just a producer in search of a band's sound."
2,"Get the name right, please!","I've read several reviews of this re-issue, and no one seems to be reading my name correctly. All you would be reviewers out there: my name is Michal, not Michael, and I was the singer with the band. Yes Carly Simon and Martha Velez did sing with the band before that, but that's me singing on the recording."
5,Great matching of business issues with technology change,"Nick has done a nice job of summarizing the current new, new technologies and matching them to business issues. Solid read for managers and technologists alike."
4,Grabs you by the throat and drags you through the pages,If you like your mysteries raw you will appreciate this one. A carefully crafted whorl is begun with the first telling of the story and it soon sucks you into the pages. I figure it's a good book if I have nightmares about it after reading before I go off to sleep. This one did it.
4,Another satisfying read from Bartholomew Gill,I would recommend any of Gill's books. I first read him in 1980. He gives you a sense of the place and the history of Ireland as well as a good read about police procedures etc. Characters are always well drawn.
3,Not for Art,"I purchased this so I could write on fabric art pieces. It does that well if you want large lettering, but I gave it only three stars because the point is too wide. Even though it is called a laundry marker, you would have a hard time writing on small labels with it."
5,Great set,"Pros: These videos are simply great. I like both John and Richards style. These vids get right to it, showing you how to do quick inductions without a lot of additional padding.Cons: This clips of these guys doing their inductions were filmed in a couple of bars. Though this demostrates that hypnosis can be done just about anywhere, another location may have been more suitable.John does most of the talking and inductions on this video, with Richard trying his best to jump in. I would have liked to have seen more equal time for Richard, learning from 2 different perspectives.All in all, great videos."
3,Interesting but too pricey,"I thought the information was sound and actual footage interesting, but it is not a good how to video; nor is the quality as good as other instructional videos. It is a slight disappointment. This is more suited for a total novice."
2,Not well prepared,"These guys can do the stuff, alright and much can be gleaned just from watching them... However, their lack of ""on camera"" experience and skills... just makes you plain uncomfortable to watch it, and hinders from the information they are trying to get across."
3,Too much talk to get to the point,Too much talk to get to the point. I can not deny it served for the purposes of learning some techniques but it took them a lot of time to do this maybe 4x more them necessary. Too many repetition of the same thing.
4,"Romantic, sexy, sad album","This is a really good album. If you want more Atari Teenage Riot, this is not for you, but if you want well-constructed vocalist/musician songs, it is. This belongs with the canon of electronica by artists that realise making great music is about collaboration. Hanin Elias clearly worked very closely with the people who made the music, producing songs that flow beautifully. This is the perfect album for thinking about your latest crush, for driving as the dawn breaks, for thinking romantic thoughts. It's angsty without being maudlin, sexy without being about sex. There are a couple of weaker tracks, but even they work as a gently crecedoing lead-in to the penultimate track (ignoring the final remix track)."
5,HP USB mouse,I got so tired of cleaning the trackball mouse. This is such a wonderful replacement for it. It's the perfect size. It glides smoothly on a mousepad or desktop. Plug n play made it a breeze to switch to the USB optical mouse.
4,Comprehensive guide to Refuge system,"Overall an excellent guide to our National Wildlife Refuges. Introductory chapters review the NWR history and key conservation issues. Then each of the refuges (over 500 of them) are described, state by state. The descriptions are generally quite thorough and interesting.The biggest flaw with the book is a total lack of maps to show you where the refuges are located. If the section for each state just had a small map, the reader would instantly be able to visualize the refuge location. Also, the book is divided into ""Featured refuges"" and ""Other refuges"", with each section arranged by state. This sometimes makes finding a refuge confusing. It would be simpler if all the refuges for each state were grouped together, rather than in two different locations.All in all a very good guide; I just wish there were some maps."
3,"Excellent, except no maps","Nice, well-written write-ups on the Wildlife Refuges. Certainly the best collection I've found, with one glaring omission: there are no maps to show where these Rufuges are! A highly annoying (and inconceivable, in this type of guide) flaw."
5,NWR the complete guide!,"This is the best book that I have found for exploring NWRs. This book lists infomation all the NWRs up to the date is was published. Detailed instructions on how to get there, what the refuge has to offer, the nearest supplies or places to stay, and contact info. If you are going to visit the NWRs this reference book is a must."
5,A Decade of Distinction.,"The author Richard Dellamora is a Victorian Scholar who offers a rich variety of Victorian gender studies in this book. I bought the book because I am doing my Thesis on Michael Field and this book has some excellent points and well done research as well as new thoughts both on Michael Field, and others, to include Vernon Lee, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, George Eliot, and other Victorian writers.Although this book has been written by an expert, it does not mean one has to be an expert to enjoy the book. Anyone interested in the Victorian fin de siecle to include but not limited to literature, gender study, and unconventionality can easily read and enjoy this work.Just to name a few of the Victorian experts who have essays in this book are Regenia Gagnier, Christopher Lane, Thais Morgan, and Yopie Prins."
2,Not so happy,"At the first glance the set may seem to be of good quality, made of heavy anodized aluminium. However, nonstick coating wears off very fast and pots are made in non-standard sizes(diameters)."
4,Excellent Value,"We have the professional set at home, and I bought the Simply Calphalon for our Apartment in NY. It is excellent quality for the price, and the non stick surface works flawlessly.That said, do not expect the heft / feel of the professional set."
3,Non-stick Surface Not Durable,"I was dissapointed with this product. I bought this set in 2002 because of the reasonable price and Calphalon name, and I was initially pleased. Despite using only nylon or wood utensils and a Dobie pad as recommended, the nonstick surface began to wear off after only about 3 years on the 10"" omelet pan. I wish I had kept the receipt for the warranty!"
4,It works...,"Not everyone is blessed with the time to run 20-30 miles a week and then spend another 2-3 days at the gym.I have found that this workout, with a low glycemic diet (as promted in the book) helps maintain fitness and keeps the fat off.If you're into distance running, and endurance sports then you won't dig this, but if you're a person stressed time then give it a try."
5,It's working for me,"I have been working out at home now for 4 weeks using one of the routines from Power of 10 and the wife has been noticing the pounds melting off around the waist. My sister noticed I was looking trimmer and she too has just bought the book. I love the work out because I am finally losing weight that has hung on to me despite the fact I bike to work 7 miles each way 3 or 4 times a week. With this work out, using just dumb bells and my own body weight, I get a deep work out in just 15 to 20 minutes (Though the book focuses on gym workouts, it also provides several workouts that can be done at home and on the road). As a beginner I try to work out 2x a week, but often times I have only worked out once a week because I felt I needed a little more rest before hitting the weights again."
5,Even Better than Expected,I was Very impressed with how simply the various elements were explained. It takes real talent to reduce concepts to their irreducible minimum. These guys delivered!
2,Neither revolutionary or scientific,"This book might help some who are not well versed in strength training, however it is a spin offof Ken Hutchin's Super Slow principles, with little substance, just filled with some passableroutines. A trainer familiar with these principles is almost a necessity , as it is easy to getinjured, one has to set the machines (if they are even adjustable) to one's body, and one has todetermine what loads to begin with, the cadence, etc. I have seldom been able to train with thesame intensity by myself compared to when Ken Hutchins was my strength coach. Get Doug McGuff's""Body by Science"" and you will learn a lot more about exercise than from this book."
5,Best book on the topic,"I've also read The Slow Burn by Hahn, Eades and Eades, and work by Ken Hutchins, but I found Power of 10 to be the most readable work available on this exercise technique. I also prefer Mr. Zickerman's ""middle of the road"" approach to nutrition and aerobic exercise over that of other authors. There probably is something to low carbohydrate diets, and there may be something to the superiority of strength training over aerobic exercise, but authors who are too fanatical on these issues alienate readers that may not have entirely abandoned the ""conventional wisdom"". Mr Zickerman makes his case without coming across as a fanatic, and leaves some leaway for readers to come along (or not) at their own pace. This is a good, useful book."
