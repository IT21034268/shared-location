3,Book for the back,I had tried this years ago for my back and it seemed to work wonders. If you stick with the program it is an excellent CD.
3,So-so,"This DVD isn't a good choice for beginners, because Rodney Yee doesn't explain the details of the poses (and he requires props). People looking for a challenge may not like the fact that two-thirds of the video is devoted to quiet exploration and relaxation.I don't use this DVD anymore, because I don't care for Rodney Yee's style, which I find somewhat shallow. I've been more impressed by the Yoga Zone instructors, who give in-depth explanations in a personable way."
2,I was falling asleep,"I felt nothing after doing this routine. It's way too slow. The video is nice though. Yee's voice and the scenery are relaxing, but that's not the point."
2,only for beginners,For those who have experience with yoga this is too simple. I would recommend a different source for back care.
3,Not for an already troubled back.,"I thought I was buying something that would help restore my aching back but instead it is more preventative. I am not able to get down on the ground. At least I can get down but can't get up. I need to operate from a chair or standing. Rodney Yee, however is a master and the background and scenery are wonderful. I own several of his discs and am a big fan. This one did not meet my expectations though."
2,Too Short,"this video is too short. I have other GAIAM producs with Mr. Yee and they are terrific, however, I would have to agree with the other consumer that this video just doesn't do the job."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. The actual practice sequence lasts only about 24 minutes...the introduction for GAIAM itself takes ages.80% of the poses were done with the help of a chair. I guess this would be a good DVD if you were seriously flexibility-challenged.It was yoga ""lite"". I really don't see how it is supposed to help strengthen the back."
5,Nice,"Nice yoga video for your back.Its worth the purchase. I use it frequently & like almost allyoga videos-its relaxing, has great stretches & helps to keep me flexible!"
4,Back Care Yoga,This is an excellent Yoga instruction video for people that suffer from acute and daily lower back pain. It is also good for the person that enjoys yoga overall. I purchased from Amazon.com because I knew that I would easily find what I was looking for.
5,Back pain free,"This is an excellent program for eliminating any muscle-based back pain. I was suffering from some significant back pain, but after a couple of weeks of following the exercises in this video, the pain completely disappeared and has not come back--even though I stopped doing the exercises some time ago. I cannot recommend this highly enough."
3,back care yoga,a good yoga stretch workout. Thoughtfully designed for working back muscles. Good awareness on all levels
5,Helps My Back,I have been working on strenngthen my abdominals since it helps with back issues and since it was working well I decided to look for more things to help me.Rodney's back care video is one of the things I am using and it has been a perfect find for me with three great routines designed to help loosen my back. The poses are easy to understand and it is nice that they are done lying on the floor or seating. A bigger plus is that he understands that people need help and the props he uses for the poses are great. They add support and assistance where I need it and really help get the benefits from the pose.Very good instruction and I will add other Rodney DVDs.
1,Take a nap insead,"First let me say that I love ROdney and hate to give such a bad review but I just waited 2 weeks for my delivery of this dvd-checked the mail everyday, couldnt wait to get started and here i am 15 minutes after finishing and I am not happy at all. I did the am/pm in the past and felt great (am was best). I thought this would be just as awesome but more specific for my back. Long story short - too many props for two little poses/ exercises/stretches. He goes a little two quickly between setting up props and doing the poses and his directions are too quick also. Toward the end I was like are you kidding me...I might as well just take a nap on my stomach. I am just floored and feel like I am getting a migrane. My neck is stiff. If i could I would ask for my money back. I suggest get Am/PM. That was what I originally was here to purchase but I read these reviews and wanted to concentrate on my back so I got this. YUCK!"
3,Not as good as the original,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I also own Rodney Yee's first back care workout ""Back Care Yoga for Beginners"" (1998, VHS), which is much better. ""Yoga for Back Care"" relies too heavily on props, moves very slowly, and doesn't cover enough poses. If you're looking for a good back care workout, go back to the original tape."
3,Best Yoga I've ever seen Great info. on healing your back.,"If it hurts move it, stretch it in other ways that don't hurt. Great info and has an MD that talks about back care as well. Would give 5 stars, but it's so slow like other yoga. update - How to cure low back pain"" video on youtube.com/user/b29349 - Foundation System is the only back exercises i have ever done that has helped."
4,Nice stretches for the back,"Good stretches for the back especially after back surgery as in my case. However, he uses chairs, towels, mats and other items. When I want to work with the DVD, I don't want to have to go collect items, some of which are not convenient, to use. If you have a very large space then adding chairs etc. might make the DVD more workable for you. The instructor is very good though and I would not mind trying his other DVD for back care."
4,Helpful for lower back pain,"I'm a dental hygienist. My lower back muscles tense and seize with long work weeks. This video completely relaxed and rejuvenated my lower back. Rodney explains everything well, so his instructions are easy to follow--especially for anyone new to yoga.You will need a couple folding chairs, a bolster (or body pillow) and a couple folded blankets. He also uses blocks, but I managed fine without them."
1,Bad for those with Back Pain!,I have arthritis in my back and neck and this video exacerbated my back & neck pain from the 1st 5 minutes! Since I had great success with AM/ PM yoga I thought I would give this a try. I am not a beginner & I have gone to many advanced yoga workshops without issues. I thought this video would help me even more. I was wrong! I have had to stop all yoga for the last 3 weeks after doing this video only once. Back Pain folks beware!!!!
4,"Nice, utilitariean set of bowls","I bought these bowls to compliment a set of Corelle plates I had already bought. I use them for eating, but I've also been avoiding using plastic in the microwave, so I use them for heating up food (the small Corelle plates act as good covers.) It's a simple design, but has a certain old-school charm. There have been a few accidental drops, but no breaks so far."
5,Good Stuff,"This wallet is nice .. its got soft leather and plenty of slots for cards, IDs and whatever else you need... It is however a little large so be prepared for it to be snug in your back pocket. But it folds thin so it wont look bulky like classic bifolds but def holds all that a normal bifold can hold in a slim classy style... def. a 5 star in my book."
5,I love this wallet,"It's a large wallet (3.6""x4.75"") but this is exactly what I wanted. Leather is soft and supple. The capacity is perfect for multiple credit cards and similiar sized (but less useful and more often than not annoying) merchant or retail ""frequent shopper"" cards. The ID window is very handy and allows people to look at your id without seeing every single item in your wallet. My last wallet, also a Fossil, lasted nearly 10 years. I think this should go the same."
5,"Time for Letting Go is a great song, has a good beat","I have listened to the CD Time For Letting Go, by Billy Ray Cyrus, I loved the beat, I could relate to the song very well since I have had to let go in my life, I like a good beat and good lyrics this song has both and I think it will be a hit."
1,not for teams,"Don't waste your money. The warm up exercises are good. Ladder drills are ok.However, the change of direction and speed drills are for 1 on 1 training sessions. The drills in themselves are not very good. Soccer is a team sport and there is little time for one on one training."
5,Invaluable,"I purchased two books, one of them was full of generic non-specific advice, the other thorough and informative, crammed with detailed pointers covering every aspect of a freelance career: The ASJA Guide to Freelance Writing.26 Chapters written by 26 top freelancers - the value of their personal insight and knowledge cannot be downplayed. I read this book front to back in days, and refer back to it constantly. Unlike other gimmicky efforts, this book is truly an invaluable resource for beginners and professionals alike."
5,Excellent Essays about the Business of Writing,"Twenty-six individual essays -- from the tools and comforts you need in your writing office to marketing yourself to editors and clients -- are woven together to provide newbie writers and experienced journalists with ideas, tools and thoughts about the business of writing. The Appendix was my favorite chapter with plenty of tips and tricks from ASJA members and their personal anecdotes. It's one of those books you'll pull down from the shelf to re-read every couple of years. Enjoyed it immensely!"
4,Useful collection of essays for the freelance writer,"Instead of just setting down a list of dos and don'ts, the ASJA guide presents a series of how-to essays by published authors that include how to work through the different aspects and challenges of freelance writing. This format allows for experience to provide guidance. I like to read about success stories and examples of what worked and what didn't work. I have used it many times to figure out different aspects of our freelance writing business."
4,All things ARE possible.,"Beautiful, robust and heartwarming. I'm glad to have this CD as part of my music collection."
4,Fudge Graham just tastes good,"Glucerna Snack Bar for People with Diabetes, Fudge Graham, 4-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)This snack bar does help level out one's glucose some and it tastes better than any of the other flavors that I have tried. I only eat a half bar at a time."
5,great little book,Picture history so good even old time residents of the area had never seen them- Always lending out my copy
3,okay but outdated,"I bought this book as a short refresher course of my furniture history knowledge learned in college. It did provide that refresher but I found it lacking somewhat.Despite being initially published in 1985, the book largely stops at mid-century modern (mid-50s/60s). Even the mid-century history is scant compared to earlier eras."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I love trying new products and am always excited when I find something I can't live without. This is not one of those products. Okay, it has a nice pepperminty taste and it has some exfoliating properties, but you can get the same effect by rubbing a wet washcloth across your lips. Really; the price is high and the shipping is also high for this tiny tube of various seed oils. I recommend Aveeno lip conditioner in chapstick form with an SPF of 15, much better. I did order more than one item from Philosophy to make the shipping a little easier to accept, but still this product is not worth the price."
2,"Good idea, but not a good product","I usually love Philosophy's products, but this one I didn't. I can't find one good thing to say about this ""lip therapy"". Well, that's not true. I can honestly say that the minty flavor was good. Other than that it feels like there is sand in your lip ointment and the effect is minimal at best. I found that using the Microdelivery Peel on my lips had a larger effect than the lip ointment. Sorry Philosophy."
2,Misleading title,"Those who are familiar with Natalie Goldberg's other books will be disappointed. This is basically like any other blank journal, with colorful pages, some quotes, and the very occasional writing prompt. For the same money, you can get a simple notebook and one of Natalie's other - and considerably more substantial - works."
1,Happy I didn't purchase it.......,I flipped through this book at the library. I saw Natalie Goldberg's name and instantly thought that I was in for a treat. WRONG!! It's a journal!! And one with an itty-bitty amount of paper to write in to boot!! Soooooo happy I didn't purchase this one. I'll save my money to be used for purchasing another book written by her.
1,buy a school notebook instead,"I was angry with myself for succumbing to propaganda when I bought this book, so un-Natalie like."
5,10 plus years experience,I have had Price Pfister fuacets for over ten years - and this one for over five years with daily use. I have had no problems with the ceramic valve leaking or dripping. I also have had no problems with the swivel neck leaking from where it swivels. The brass finish has also held up very well. This has made me buy only Price Pfister faucets for the apartment rentals that I have.
1,"Don't bother, it's not worth it","I wanted to like this book. I really did. It's a discussion of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" from a feminist viewpoint. However, after reading it, I can't really say very many positive things about it. It seemed to me as if every point Roberts made was illogical and simply manipulated the episodes to suit the point she was trying to make. Part of the problem is that it was based a lot on French feminism, which I find uneven at times, but there is good writing that stems from it, and this is not it. Roberts contradicted herself, and used to the same evidence in various parts of the book to come to different conclusions.I was hoping she might redeem herself in the conclusion, as I often found authors have more coherency in their conclusions, but no. The conclusion was just another ruined analysis, this time of ""Voyager"". When I finally put the book down, I was relieved."
1,Rubbish,I bought this thinking it might be a good 70s horror with Carradine and Buono. It wasn't. Utter rubbish from start to finish as it made no sense whatsoever.
3,"give it a look, at least....","o.k., 'Corrector Yui' on the surface, isnt gonna' change a whole lot of minds one way or the other about magical girls anime like say' 'Sailor Moon' or ""CardCaptor Sakura'. it is very derivative looking. but set your expectations aside and just watch it and it may surprise you just a little. the manga was written by Kia Asamiya (Nadesico, Silent Mobius), who admitted this is his first shoujo (girls') manga. so, if for no other reason than that, check it out. im from missouri, and there aint a whole lot of anime around here either. i found this dvd in Dollar General for $3. a bargain at any price. i'd be interestedin finding the rest of the series. it ran for some 50 eps. the dvd itself aint got anything in the way of extras.(clean open and close animation, that's it).Curse you Viz!!!! anyway you may still like this, but it definitely wont suit everybody's tastes."
3,Weclome to Compnet,"Like ""Sailor Moon""? Like ""Card Captor Sakura""?Like ""Reboot""? Like anything that dealswith magic girls? This shows is similarto that. The plot is that Yui goes to try tostop the old Compnet Host, Grosser, and his minonsfrom weaking the Net. It's up to Yui and IR, hercute mascot in similar to the other sidekickssuch as Luna (from Sailor Moon) and Kerbos(Card Captor Sakura) saving the day. The japanesesounds good, and though the dub is at leastOK in my book...thought I hadn't to watchthe dub track for one full eposide."
2,Corrector WHO?,This anime I would consider for ages 10 up for the brief nudity. Sailor Moon is better then this cartoon looks like it belongs on Nickolean. Yui is not your average 21 century junior high school student she can't tell the difference between a computer chip and a potato chip. she's a girl who makes contact with IR. She has to save the world when an evil super computer threatens to take over the globle system.
2,Marketing is the optimal word here!,The book is informative however terribly boring and has a lack of design and no imagery (besides bad cartoons). Marketing your creative portfolio shows no visual examples nor does the title or nice cover really depict the real aspects of the book. I would not recommend the book for anything other than simple marketing ideas and basic information structure. the book however would be good for a High School based program needing some multiple choice / fill in the blank questions for the students to start out with. I had higher expectations and it didn't come close to delivering.
5,LOVE IT!,"The firm backboard is what makes this inversion equipment the best! I love it, and best of all, Amazon gave free shipping! You can't get much better than that!"
2,Worst spiderman game,"The only things i liked was the free roam, but the missions are sometimes fun but theres a lot of puzzle like things in missions which are really annoying. Some of the missions are difficult and the thing i really don't like is theres no cheats to help get through tough spots"
3,Good if you haven't played Spidey 2.,"First off, if you have played the game Spiderman 2, then you should just really look at this as an expansion pack. It doesn't really do anything that Spiderman 2 didn't. Your in a very similiar enviornment as you were in the second, but in it's time Spiderman 2 was much better. I beat Spiderman 2 twice I believe. I'm a third of the way through the game and am not sure whether or not I will ever finish it. I had started back on it not long ago, but I got frustrated and put back on the shelf. If you played Spiderman 2 and moderately enjoyed it, then this isn't for you. If like me you loved Spidey 2 then I would check this out.Overall 5.5-6.0"
4,Spider-Man 3 review,"I got this game in my mail and when I did the first thing I did was check the disc and see if it looked clean. It looked horrible and I wasn't sure at all if it was going to work so I tried to play it and the screen kept saying Open Tray. I am very upset that someone would actually get away with giving this game to the website and allow them to sell it. I am furious and I am looking for a way to complain about this game but I can't find one other than writing a review. I don't know what to do I'm just so angry. It looks like the previous owner had spilled some soda on it and give it away because it stopped working. I want a new game, but why do I have the feeling that you won't give me one? If you can then please let me no"
3,...yay?,"I loved Spider-Man 2 on Xbox! So much fun to zip around and look at the city and fight crime! I completely forgot about this one after it came out, and I found it on here for pretty cheap. And I find myself thinking...it's okay. Not great, not terrible. Just okay. If you're a big Spidey fan, pick up Spider-Man 2! And if you still need more, then pick up this one if you can get it under ten bucks."
2,An Exercise In Frustration,"I bought this game when it first came out and found it the other day. Now I know why I hardly played it. Jumpy camera, ridiculous missions and silly enemies. Sorry, just swinging around NY could not save this one. I remember having much more fun with Spider-Man 2.I really tried to have fun with this but when some gang kept respawning out out pots in one of the hangouts I knew this was bad. Not to mention the Arsenic Candy Gang? Really? I found myself actually being emabarrassed for Spider-Man having to fight a gang of school girls. I was more embarrassed when they mopped the floor with me because of the horrible combat system. Combat in this game is totally non-satisfying.With so many other Spider-Man games to choose from you should definitely pass on this. Pick up Web of Shadows instead."
3,good,"This is a good spiderman game, but it does not have a good story and some of the missions are very hard. I would have given his game five stars if it had a better story. If you do not care about the story this is the perfect game for you. You can fight in many ways and there is many enemies to fight."
4,One of the Most Beautiful Spider-Man Games 2 Date!,"One of the Most Beautiful Spider-Man Games 2 Date!I am going 2 be generous with my review and give this a 4 star. But, its not as awful as a lot of the reviews make it out to be. I must admit it that this is probably one of the most beautiful Spider-Man games 2 date!"
3,Downgrade,"I wouldn't say I had high hopes for this game. Based strictly on reviews, I assumed this game would be similar to the spider-man 2 movie tie in game. I was sorely disappointed to find out just how much had been changed.Spider-man 2 was great, it had its flaws... but it was a solid and fun game. Instead of building on what was already good, activision took and made into a mess.Combat is broken, the boss fights are too hard, and the ""button tapping"" is absurd. Every boss you fight cannot be defeated until you press a series of buttons in time as they appear on the screen. You have about a quarter second to react, so you typically end up doing it 3 or 4 times just to get it right.What made me happy however, is the city itself. It looks great, and simply swinging around doing random missions is far more gratifying than actually playing the story.[...]"
5,A nostalgic classic,"I absolutely love this album. I was never a huge Neil Young fan but all of the songs on this album move me - especially ""Unknown Legend"" and ""Harvest Moon."" This is a definite CD to have for lazy days or romantic days or anyday. It has it all."
5,A Neil Young classic,"I've owned this record for a good 8 years and I still listen to it with the same whimsical, eyes closed on the couch ease that I did when I first played it on my old Yamaha cd player. A definate must have for any music collection. Even if you are not a Neil Young fan you will enjoy it for years to come."
1,Harvest Moon,The first three songs on this CD would not play they skipped. The remaining songs played fine. This was a new CD too. Not sure if I will purchase any more music from Amazon.
3,Harvest Moon,Harvest Moon being Neil Young's 1992 release and was met with good reviews by the critics. Allmusic giving it 3 1/2 and Rolling Stone 4 out of 5. I think this is a quite good album and I give it 3 stars since I can not give it 3.5 and 4 is a little much for this album. The album did quite well sales wise and peaked at #16 on the Billboard 200. 3/5.
4,"A gem, but not Neil's best country album","I'm a passionate Neil Young fan, and I love many songs on this album, including ""Hank to Hendrix,"" ""Harvest Moon,"" ""You and Me"" and ""War of Man."" These all rank with his best acoustic material. ""Old King"" is a charming ode to Neil's lost pet. However, I think many of the reviews here overrate the album and don't acknowledge some of its flaws. Except for ""Old King,"" the album really slows down after the first five songs. ""One of these days"" has enchanting lyrics, but the tune doesn't grab me, and it drags too long. ""Such a Woman"" is overwrought and over-orchestrated, and ranks with the worst of Neil's London Symphony Orchestra dreck from Harvest. ""Dreamin Man"" is dull, and ""Natural Beauty"" makes good background music but nothing more. I'm not sure how he kept that one up for 10 whole minutes without putting his audience to sleep. This ranks as Neil's second-best country, acoustic flavored album, I think, right below ""Comes a Time"" but above ""Harvest."""
3,"Mediocre, unless you are a real Neil Young fan","I am not a wild Neil Young fan, but I like some of his music a lot, and have several other albums of his (for example, I like Zuma and Live Rust). When I bought and listened to Harvest Moon,I was rather disappointed. None of the material grabbed me at all. I found it rather dull. I have seen other good reviews of this album, which is why I bought it. But, I am surprised now as to why it would be rated highly."
2,hope it grows on me,"I listen to this cd as much as This Notes For You.Life is a better cd. This is a cd for those trying to relive Harvest. I hope Prarie Wind is better. This cd doesn't do much for me but I'll try it some more.After all, Trans has grown on me. Maybe I'm a little hard on this cd but I don't find myself singing any of the songs after listening to it."
4,An Excellent CD,"I've always been a fan of Neil's more acoustic-sounding albums, and this one's no exception; my favorite track on the album is the last, Natural Beauty. Excellent."
3,very pretty sound but as for the songs themselves.,"Harvest Moon is a beautiful cd. I think it is strongest in the way it was mixed and produced. The reverb on his voice along with the sounds of the guitars and everything is pretty. The song writing, on the other hand, stays strong through the first half of the cd, but then takes a bit of a fall once the chord progressions become a little too obvious. With this I mean, for all you theory cats, there's a lot of 4-5 then back to 1. So, like I said, the sound is extremely beautiful and it's good sleeping music. But the songs can hardly compare to a lot of his other work."
4,Neil Young CD,The product is new in wrapper and arrived undamaged which is good because it is a gift. Have a good Holiday.
5,Neil Young at his best,"By far one of my favorite Neil Young albums. I even have the poster of the cd cover hanging in my living room. Anyone who loves Neil Young's acoustic side will love this album, it is romantic, relaxing, and just plain beautiful. From Harvest Moon to the best song on the album Natural Beauty, you will be in Heaven when you listen to this album."
5,strangely somnambulent,"I think a good way of differentiating good artists and exceptional artists is to see if you find yourself listening to the lyrics. Springteen passes this test, and so does Neil Young, who with this mellow 1992 release has never been better. It's a gentle album; cosy and relaxing. So relaxing, in fact, that I could quite happily drift off to sleep. The songwriting is top-drawer, the musicianship competent witout being flashy or pretentious and the backing vocals are gorgeous. Highlights? The opener, Unknown Legend is wonderful song about a girl who has never been able to grow roots anywhere, while Hank to Hendrix examines cutural attachments to the past. Harvest Moon deserves the five stars simply because it is everything that a Neil Young record should be and then some. Best not to play it in your car when night-driving, however, or you might wake up with a steering wheel wrapped round your head."
4,Neil's best mellow effort,"Harvest Moon is everything Harvest is cracked up to be, but isn't. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Harvest, but I'm also probably the only one of Neil's fans who feels this explicit sequel is better. I normally would complain about the record's country elements, but they actually make the better songs as good as they are. What are those songs, you ask? My personal favorites are Unknown Legend; From Hank to Hendrix; the swaying, mellow title track; War of Man; and the ten-minute finale, Natural Beauty. Looks like a five-star album, right? Too bad that's not quite true - get rid of the banjo-laden Old King; acoustic ballad You and Me and One of These Days, and that would be true. As it stands, this is a must. Be sure to get its two predecessors as well: Freedom and Ragged Glory are also near-classics."
2,Not useful,Much of the tape is taken with stretching exercises not specific to rebounding - nothing you don't know already.
2,Great recording ot a poor performance,"DVD-Audio is a great format for Hi-Fi audio disk, and AIX-records did a stellar job recording this performance (as they always do). Unfortunately, the performance itself is disappointing - although technically precise, it is very mechanical and soul-less, possibly one of the worst recordings of these pieces that I've heard.This disk contains both video content (with DTS audio track) and DVD-audio content. DVD-audio requires special hardware player. DVD-video player will only play DTS track, which is inferior not only to DVD-Audio but even to CD format.Amazon does not sell DVD-audio disks made by AIX records, but they are available directly from the manufacturer's site for twenty five dollars."
5,Fab blanket,"This blanket is great. It is pretty much permanently tied to his car seat-- when he is dozing off, I flip it over.. when it is raining out I flip it over to keep him dry on way from car to house...you can also untie it and use it to sit on in the park. It's a great blanket."
5,Excellent Quality,"This is a great price for 50 sheets. What surprised me most was the quality of this paper...thick, backed nicely, low gloss. I print out a lot of photos for my work, and they come out professional looking with no fading. I've received a lot of positive comments from photographers about this paper, too. Would definitely purchase again."
5,Best paper ever!,"We tried other paper but this is the best. Great color, great texture, and no jams in our printer."
3,Unfortunately not for HP Vivera pigment printers....,"I have a B9180 and have searched high and low for icc profiles for this paper. If I had only read the fine print, "" not for HP 38 ink"" I could have saved myself the aggravation."
3,Good Photo Paper Not 2-sided copy,"Good papar for photos. Wanted 2-sided copy paper to create calendars. The ""HP"" logo is on the other side. Cannot use for my need. Purchased Canon Pixma Matte Photo Paper. This works great."
5,"fine, good, used before, will buy again","I've purchased this paper before, it works fine. My only issue is remembering to pull out unused paper from the printer."
3,Opps Not for Laser Printer,"Yikes! I did not read the listing carefully enough and then tried to use this paper in my laser printer with horrible effect! The ink smeared everywhere. The paper itself, however, is very nice and thick."
5,The best there is,"I've tried so many photo papers. I wait for buy one, get one free, sales.HP premium Plus is the one!"
5,BRING THIS PAPER BACK HP!!!!!!,"BIG BIG BIG MISTAKE by HP to do away with this paper and call the new paper ""BETTER""??? By whos standards??? This is the BEST paper out there and HP says they will not be making it anymore. I hope HP listens to the customer and change things back. The ""NEW"" paper is not worth $34 a box!!!"
3,"Not bad, but NOT great either......","With an emphasis on the 'NOT great' part. You are probably better off getting either the DSST official test guide or the recommended Human Resource mgmt text on the Excelsior content guide. Technically, it DOES deliver what it said it would, which is sample questions and answers of previous tests. However, no EXPLAINATIONS to the answers. It is certainly NOT a self-contained study guide, like <http://www.120collegecredits.com>. 120collegecredits.com is your most economical, comprehensive deal to passing many of the various clep/dsst/Excelsior exams. I only bought this guide because instantcert did not yet develop a content guide for this particular test (ECE Human Resource Mgmt).So buy a used copy if you can find one, which I happen to have! But also check out <http://www.120collegecredits.com>. Good luck on the test :)"
2,chipped garnet,The ring was nice and looked like picture but had a crack in one Garnet and another one had a large chip.
4,Classic Fun,"I grew up playing a home made version of skittles and bought this one for my nephew. It isn't as large as the old one, but still lots of fun."
4,Good but not made like it used to be.,I had this same game when I was growing up and played with it often over the years. Bought this one for my 3 and 8 year old. Frame is unfinished and rough but kids still like to play.
5,Great Christmas Gift,My boys both loved this game last Christmas. We played it more than their X-box games. A timeless game that never loses its passion. Get it for your kids they'll truly love it as much as you did.
5,Great old game,I played this when I was a kid and my family always had a great time with it. My kids are older but I wanted a low tech game we could play together. I couldn't believe I found this again. It's not as big as the one I remember but it's well made and we've been having a blast with it. I highly recommend this as a nice low tech family game enjoyed by all.
5,An old classic...,"I remember playing the Carron game ""Skittles"" at a friend's house back in the 1970's. I purchased one for my own kids when they were 7 and 10 years old and we enjoyed many family ""competitions"". When I began babysitting my 6 and 8 year old niece and nephew, I drug out the old game out and showed them how to play. Now they beg to play it whenever they come over. I plan to surprise them with a game of their own for Christmas. It's so durable--our old game still looks like new."
4,One-handed wonder,"The Agetec ASCII Grip is a great addition to any Playstation owners collection. This one-handed controller is light, comfortable and easy to use. It has all the necessary buttons of a standard Playstation Controller only it leaves one hand free to do other things like graphing a map or jotting down notes while you play your favorite video game. This controller is mostly recommended for use with RPG or strategic-type games. This item gets 4 stars simply because it's a one-handed wonder."
2,Orchestra below par in Organ Symphony,"Some symphonies can be played reasonably well by just about any competent orchestra. Other works require virtuoso orchestras. The Saint-Saens 3rd is one of them. Only the best orchestras should attempt this difficult masterpiece. The violin articulation required in the first movement sounds incredibly difficult and apparently it is because this Moscow orchestra cannot play it. Only in the slow movement do they sound good.The Franck gets a fine performance and since the CD costs only 3 bucks, you can still buy it and get good value. But look elsewhere for the Saint-Saens."
1,disaster with ABEBooks,"ABEBooks said they had this product and invited questions.I asked them if they had the CD that was supposed to come with book.I never heard from them again.Amazon's choice of contractors (including International Books) is pretty abysmal.If you can't do better, you ought to stick to your own business."
4,SEEMS UNBELIEVEABLE,"SOME OF THE STORY SEEMED UNBELIVEABLE. THE FACT THAT THE DAUGHTER, SARAH, NEVER HEARD ""ANYTHING"".-FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. MR. GREEN AND SHARON ARE TWO VERY, VERY SICK PEOPLE. RICKY FATHER'S IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING TO.IT'S ALSMOST LIKE THE CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE SINCE THE DAY THEY WERE BORN!"
3,Not to believable,"I found this book to be alittle over done...I do not believe That Ricky Greene suffered all those repulsive things as a child that he claims i believe he did suffer abuse from the hands of his father but I dont believe that he was sexually assaulted time and time again by different strange Men i believe he was a homosexual and seeked out this pleasure, I think its over dramatic and that Ricky Greene was just a major sicko!Lunatic.. I have read numerous true crime books (75 to be exact) and i certainly can tell a bogus story this appears to be one...I do believe Ricky did all those things I just think his background that the author writes about are just excuses for his horrific behavior"
4,High School Opinion,"This is the first time I have ever written a book review, but here it goes. In my opinion, Blood Rush is a story of a sick man who believes in what he is doing. I think that however cruel and messed others may see Ricky Green, he saw what he was doing as a favor to the world around him. His molestation as a child caused him to become savage to all males who made moves on him, or tried to hit on him. This savagery caused him to lash out and destroy those who were not fit to be in this world(whores and homos...his words). He had a great deal of hurt in his life and was due some respect, and he believed that children from families like his deserved respect too. He thought that if went straight to the source of the problems, the bad parents and child molestors, he could save the world and somehow make his killings acceptable. This book tells the whole story of Ricky Lee Green's life, and I think that I was able to see why serial killers are able to do what they do, kill people."
5,Wonder tool,Just how many times have many of us come across something in our homes that we could not explain? In this case the problem was electrical. And although I have many electrical tools at my disposal in which to trouble shoot with this tool came in extremely handy requiring only one hand. And how cool it was to track the problem down in just a couple of minutes. This tool is way cool.
2,"Save your money, look at Klein or another reputable brand.","Bought it thinking it would be a good item. Has lots of features that makes it beneficial (theoretically) but can't hold up in the field. On mine, it gives false readings when you even touch the on/off switch with the sensitivity adjusted. Here's the big turn off: for a +$30 tool only a 1 year warranty!! You can send it back to them (out of warranty) to have their tech department look at it and repair it but it is a $50 flat repair fee for all their instruments. First and last Extech instrument I will purchase. Stick with Klein, Fluke, Ideal, or Greenlee; better quality, better value, better warranty (usually 2 years or more)."
2,Waste of money for me,"Maybe I don't know what I'm doing, but this didn't seem to work very well at all. Emitted signals seemingly randomly, was not able to get anything useful out of it."
2,not very reliable detector,"I am generally disappointed with its weak detection ability of voltage and current. Certainly, it is to weak to reliably detect electric wires under drywall or plaster and therefore its current detecting ability is fairly useless."
1,A bad joke,"This ""detector"" has absolutely no capability for tracing voltage or current through walls-- just get that out of your head from the start. there are a few situations where this detector might work, but many more where it simply doesn't.Take a simple example. I wanted to see if a an outlet had power. The outlet located a few inches from the first had power and threw off enough EM signal so that I couldn't tell if the outlet in question was powered. When I shut the second outlet off, I could then test the first.bottom line, this is no better than the $5 detector available at any hardware store."
4,YAY!,"Received this bag and used it the next day for lunch! Paying about $8 a day for mediocre food at school gets expensive! This easily fits everything I need and more. EASILY fit the 5 cup Rubbermaid Premier container, plus a water bottle. At least I think It's the 5 cup container. And on top of that, there was still room.Because it is flexible, it can easily shape to the containers being put inside. But even after putting food into it, it does not look at all bulky.I have gotten plenty of complements on it at school. The only down side as otters have mentioned is that it does not keep food cold for very long due to the material it is made out of. I fix that problem by freezing something I will be eating on later in the day to use as an ice pack for food I will be eating earlier.Once empty, you can fold it up or roll it up and put it away.Overall, completely worth it."
5,Lunch Tote,"Wish I had purchased sooner. My children love these lunch totes, and I like that I can wash them. Now I know their lunchbox is clean."
1,not big enough,"This is ok for a sandwich packer, but for those of us who bring big salads or leftovers, not big enough to fit the containers"
3,"Worth the read, but not the hype","Critics must be easily shocked if they really think this book is as ``shocking'' as its jackets suggest. Buss is a clear writer and does a fine job of explaining a theory of sexuality based on evolutionary psychology, but I don't think his conclusions are that new, or even that shocking. The bulk of what he says can be restated (without the supporting data) in a much slimmer book. I recommend The Evolution of Desire to anyone who hasn't heard basic arguments about evolutionary psychology before. But if you've done any reading at all about evolutionary biology, this is probably not a terribly revealing read."
4,Interesting mating strategy!,"The book is not so much politically correct as socially correct. With remarks like, ""Much of what I discovered about human mating is not nice"" and suggesting we use ostracism and emotional damage to control abhorrent behaviors and reduce the more brutal aspects of human behavior. More likely, if anything, the bar for what constutes brutal behavior will be raised, but then again, if the gene is as selfish as many of us expect, we can only anticipate new behaviors of whatever shape necessary to conform to social and environmental context. We have the opportunity to change for the better, but the least appealing part of the book is the personably artistic way it departs from science into optimistic musing. Interesting mating strategy, but hey, economic times are good!"
1,A Failed First Attempt at Evolutionary Psychology,"Prior toSex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality [Hardcover] this was the accepted explanation of human monogamous pair bonding. The problem is that this view is very negative. One way to put it is that all women are whores, if single: retail, and if married: wholesale. There's quite a bit of space in Sex at Dawn to show that Buss is wrong in this book. If you're considering buying this book you would be much better off getting Sex at Dawn."
3,Evolution of desire.,"The author does a superb job tracking down the evolution of desire via a plethora of studies, including some conducted by the author and his colleagues. Though it's true that evolution has granted us certain ""sexual strategies"", psychologically we are more complex mentally than hunters and gathers. The book reads exactly as the title suggest. The author never dabbles into behavioral psychology to explain anything left unexplained by evolutionary psychology. You may catch yourself arguing with the book, trying to explain human motives through behavioral psychology. A major pet peeve for me is I often find the author repeating statements, especially in the later chapters."
3,"""David M. Bass Refuses To Accept the Obvious Conclusion...!""","THE EVOLUTION OF DESIRE is a very interesting book, but author David M. Bass refuses to accept the obvious conclusion of his research about Sociobiology--women choose men by looks! Yes, he does show that there are other variables, but after he rules out one night stands as a reason for mate choice--and gives some terrific numbers to show that women will say no to one night stands, but men will say yes!--Bass goes on to demonstrate how and why women prefer tall, atheltic men over their shorter, less athletic competitors. But not only does Bass try to downplay the importance of looks in mate choice, he even apologizes at one point saying, ""Much of what I discovered about human mating is not nice."" What kind of scientist is this?But THE EVOLUTION OF DESIRE is still a very interesting book and it has a well drawn, realistic cover.Chari Krishnan Tango2200@Hotmail.Com"
2,I have no luck,"this thing seems not bad according to other reviews. But I have no luck, mine is a defective one. It just refuses to charge when it is plugged in AC."
2,Don't buy if you plan on using it for running or exersize,"I bought this MP3 player mainly for running and other aerobic activity. When I was out running, it totally just locked up on me and the reset button would not even work. I had to wait for the battery to die in order for it to turn off. I called Iomega and they sent me out a new one with-in a few days. First time I was out running with the new one, the same thing happened. Iomega replaced it again saying that it isn't meant for any strenuous activity (opposite from what the web page says). I also don't like the fact that you can't replace the batteries. If you're out and that things runs out - tough cookies!!I sold the new one on Ebay and bought a Intel Pocket Concert which is absolutely awesome!!!"
2,The bastard child of Iomega,"I purchased this MP3 player for my girlfriend to use when snowboarding, and we have had nothing but problems with it. The firmware is buggy, and tech support is non-existent! Iomega has stopped production on this device, and I'm not sure if they plan to continue to support it. If you really want to know about it, check out iomega.com's tech support section for this device... it will be a real eye opener to anyone planning on buying it. It's a great idea, but dosn't live up to what it could have beem."
3,Close but no cigar,"Having owned the Iomega Hip Zip for 2 weeks, the one warning I give to all prospective buyers is 40MB is not enough space. It is enough to hold only 7 decent quality MP3 tracks, and although the lesser quality WMA can be used to store around 15 tracks, the sound deterioration is frustrating.The Hip Zip has the potential to be a wonderful product. The zip disks are a convenient way of storing music, and the player itself, whilst being a little large and heavy, is robust and comes supplied with a useful belt attachment.However, my advice is to wait for the 100MB Hip Zip. The 40MB capacity of the current player just isn't enough, and more of your time will be spent attempting the impossible (squeezing 20 quality tracks onto a disk) than actually listening to the music.Be patient and wait...100MB is on the way."
2,Not as Good as it Gets!,"This product is not as good as I thought it was going to be, so those looking to purchase it should shop around or defintely by it used!"
2,It ate my disk!,"I recently received the Iomega HipZip MP3 player for my birthday. It worked for about 3 days, but then it would not eject my disk. I tried everything (tweezers, shaking it, delicately manipulating the disk), but nothing worked!However, the player does have some nice features. The volume gets really loud, so you won't have a problem hearing it. Also, the backlight display is nice, and so are the buttons.Bottom line, buy at your own risk...it may work fine, or it may die, like mine did."
1,Pretty poor showing,"I am having trouble saying anything nice about it. Its bulking weights 5-10 times most flash MP3 players. The controls are touchy. It is very easy to restart your clik-disks. The clik-disks are cheap compared to Flash but CD-Rs are cheaper and last longer. The RIOvolt and Samsung's MP3 CD-R players have out done it. If you want light weight and compact look at some of the smaller lighter flash units. If you want a large selection on songs, RIOvolt is better."
5,HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY,THIS THING IS AWSOME. THE MEMORY DISKS ARE CHEAP AND HOLD ALOT. THE HEADPHONES SUCK SO U SHOULD GET THOSE STREET STYLE ONES. VERY DURABLE. BLA BLA BLA JUST GET IT IF YOU HAVE THE DOUGH BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE 200 OR SO TO SPEND GET A RIO 500
2,Ain't nothing but a pretty face,"Well, I ve had this player for a while now, about 8 months I'd say. Out of all that time it's been in the working condition for about 3 months only, and that is including the 2 replacements iOmega sent me after the previous player broke down. As a player, it's a pretty great thing, with tremble/bass adjustments and all that a player should have, BUT since it's zip disk input keeps breaking down, I would not recommend it to anyone, unless they plan on using just one zip disk and never take it out (if you do take disks out and put them back in, chances are that they will get stuck on the 50th time, and have fun ordering the replacement). The only thing saving it from a ""1"" is that I really liked it 'till it broke down."
1,Am I the chump for buying something from Iomega again?,"I've had this unit a month and it's broken, it ate a disk. OK, that can happen, but the disk killed the player. I've tried emailing Iomega customer support and have not had any results or return email. I'm not sure anyone is reading the customer service email. But Iomega did it again. The 40MB disks are only 38MB. Just like the Zip100 was never 100, but 92MB. I think I've finally learned to not buy anything from Iomega."
4,"Best equipment, OK for runners.",Pros:Simple.Small.Stable.A well known manufacturer.Rechargable. (budget friendly).Reusable storage.Cons:40 minutes playing time.Beefy. (for running: dances in the shirt's pocket)
3,"When it works, it's great","This is a great unit -- when it works. It has some serious reliability issues, however. Although it hasn't happened to me very often, the unit locks up occasionaly, requiring the user to reset the unit with a paper clip. If you visit iomega's web site and drill down into the user-to-user forum for the HipZip, you'll see numerous angry posts and gripes about freezing and diskette-drive malfunctions. Several folks are on their third replacement unit. (I understand that iomega no longer makes this device.)Also, the design engineers' decision to equip the unit with a non-replaceable rechargeable battery was just plain stupid."
1,HipZip discontinued by Iomega,"Here is what Iomega now says about HipZip:Thank you for contacting IomegaDirect's online support services.I understand that you want to know the future availability of the HipZip drive.Unfortunately, Iomega has discontinued production of the HipZip drive. It will no longer be available on the IomegaDirect website. There has been no item released that replaces the HipZip.I apologize for any inconvenience this causes.Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need further assistance. Once again, thank you for using IomegaDirect's online support services.Sincerely,Mary AnneIomegaDirect's Customer Service"
4,Great Digital Audio Player,"This is one of the best digital audio players I've ever used. It definately beats the RIO hands down as far as sound quality and when you add in the ability to swap PocketZip disks, it's WAY more cost effective. Other than being a little more bulky than other players, it's a great value!"
5,A Must Have!,"Wow, I love this Iomega player. It's better than I imation. It's great, it has a good size and feel. The music sounds Good and the best part it never skips, which I wasn't sure if that was going to be a problem before I bought it. I can bang it against my hand forever and it keeps playing. The only to improvements the Hip Hop can make for there next model is include a fm/am tuner and maybe come up with a disk that can hold 80 MB. Over all this Mp3 player rocks. Oh ya the clik disk, you can't beat the price per MB verses any other media card."
2,"Reliable, it 'aint","Seemed like a great product at first, with additional ability to store files and connect to the PC, as well as being a decent MP3 player. I quickly found out the unit was slow in response when turning on and off and going thru the menu options. Also, since it is a mechanical drive, the unit hung up if shook or jostled and only way to reset is to put a small pin into the reset hole.The most disturbing thing, however, is that the product is unreliable and likely to fail within a year. Since Iomega no longer support the units - DO NOT BUY!!"
1,junk,"I got this MP3 player for Christmas, and it lasted about 5 minutes before the disk got stuck in the player. After we finally got the disk out, the player would not recognize either of the two disks that came with the player."
1,horrible....waste of money,i wasted so much money on this thing. it ate up the disks..they got stuck in it and of course it did all of this right when i was about to go away and needed it most.do not buy this unless you like wasting money.
2,Good for a little while,"I received this MP3 player as a gift from my parents about two years ago after I had done quite a bit of research. I really enjoyed the player for quite awhile, it worked well, gave me good sound and everything, but then, it stopped working. I tried getting the new firmware, which was very hard to get to upload onto the player and that didn't help. I don't use it anymore because it is too much of a hassle. I think my player might just have been a lemon, but I guess I will never know."
1,Sorta Ok,"This worked alright for about 6 months, then the plate that covers the LCD screen popped off. Well, just reglued it, but whatever. Its most recent problem is everytime I turn it on, it makes a very odd grinding noise before proclaiming the disk unknown. Once working, it spontainously freezez and you must use the restet button to fix it. I would not recomend this device, get a Rio, let fancy, but better."
2,I'm Shocked,"I bought this product when it was fresh off the line, mainly for the cheap memory expansion that it offered with the zip disks. I am a high school student so of course I took it to school, to listen to on the bus or where ever. I don't know what caused it but after about two months of using this product the battery life greatly lowered. It lowered to about 1-2 hours before it needed recharging again. It's a great product otherwise but the fact that the irreplacable batteries go bad after only a few months is a big dissapointement for me. I recomend not buying this product simply for the decrease in battery life."
2,Beware,Before you buy be warned that other reviewers and myself have experienced problems with the HIPZIP portable drive....while i think this is an excellent product...it may suffer from a defect of devouring clik! disks and dying...i do not know if this only applies to certain versions or wot because iomega has manfuactured them thru different companies....hopefully they will get these defective players off the market...it was unfortunate (in my case) to have such a great player with such a disasterous defect...
1,Thin and lacking in content,"I bought this book because it was the only book available on plank grilling at the time. Unfortunately, it is just a collection of unrelated recipes with nothing about technique. The book tells you to get untreated wood and soak it in water ahead of time. That is the entire content on technique. There is only one recipe that uses whole fish and it is for arctic char. The book is less than a hundred pages. Most of it is soups, salads and side dishes. There are much better books on plank grilling available now. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Does not rate five stars!,"Very disappointed. The 2 lead recipes used in the TV cooking demo as well as in the book are very good. That's it. Many ingredients are either difficult to find or unobtainable which makes some recipes practically useless, if you want to follow it for the correct results. Other recipes include the use of store-bought BBQ sauces, which can alter the taste completely, depending on what brand used. BBQ sauce recipes should have been included. Certainly not worth [the money spent on it]! Don't waste your money. Go to the BBQ or Food.tv websites for not only free, but much better results."
5,Praise for the Atkins Book....,"I am living proof the Atkins plan works... This book, the revised ATkins Plan, and the Diabetes Revolution are all good books to read... With all diet plans and eating modification... use your common sense, consult a physician and use in moderation... What works for you... is all that matters!...."
5,The Best,This book came almost immediately upon ordering it! Good condition as stated by seller. Wrapped securely. Already lost 17 pounds on following the contents of book. V. Hokanson
2,"good flow, short life","The flow is good, but it lasted less than 2 years. For the price, it should last longer than that."
3,Kathy Smith should sue,"The choreography and work out in this DVD is eerily similar to the Kathy Smith pregnancy workout DVD, at least in the prenatal section. I have both DVDs and that was not the best use of my money. the workout is ok, at least some cardio, but the cuing is prety fast paced and some of the arm movements seem needlessly complicated and off-beat."
3,good,This video is a good steady workout. Nothing too strenuous. For women who want to keep active but not overdo. The 80's theme needs to go.
4,Good 45 minute workout,"This is a good workout for the second and third trimesters. The workout consists of a warm-up, 3 low-impact aerobics songs, a leg and butt workout, some abs and kegels, and a cooldown. I could definitely feel it on my thighs the next day, and the level of exhaustion seems appropriate for pregnancy (I exercised regularly before pregnancy and most of the first trimester - this is a good scaling down for the second trimester). You may need to add an additional 15 minutes of legwork at the end if you exercised before pregnancy.The instructors and music date from the 80s, but it's still a good workout for pregnancy, and it helps that all the instructors seem to be in their third trimesters.There's also a post-baby workout, which I haven't tried, but it seems challenging enough."
1,Not the best,"I didn't like this DVD at all. I felt like I was doing an arobics class from the 80s. I don't think she focused enough on being pregnant, like some of the other Pre-natal workouts do and I won't do this program again. I don't feel like it was helping me to get ready for delivery. It was a waste of money and time. I think I was fooled by the Buns Of Steel name."
2,I didn't like this one,"If you are used to pretty intense workouts (i.e. you're a marathon runner or aerobics instructor) this one is definately not for you! This might work better for pregnant moms who just want to incorporate a some kind exercise routine into thier lives, but never REALLY took physical fitness seriously!"
4,My favorite pregnancy dvd,I am into the good ol' fashion aerobics that is like dancing and this was exactly that but low impact. Loved this dvd while pregnant. The girls on it are cheesy looking but hey I was all belly and I really believe it was because of this dvd.
3,It's Okay,"Very 80's outfits & style, I am very active so I was hoping for more, great for someone who was not a workout freak prior to pregnancy."
3,Definitely order at least 1 size small,"The shirt itself is a pretty good quality especially for the price (although the shipping doubles to amount spent). But it definitely doesnt look as pictured (not curved or girly) even though it is a ""womens"" shirt. But quality of the material is good as Gildan is expected to be. I'm usually an XL in womens (I'm about a 38D), but this shirt was too big on me. A Large or even a Medium would've fit better so the size chart isn't accurate. Too much of a hassle to return/exchange so I guess I can use it as a sleep shirt. Cheers."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered two of these t-shirts and neither of the colors was nice, more intense than the color indicators on the web site. The quality was average, and the sizing was way too generous for what the size chart indicated. I normally wear a small t-shirt but because of their size chart I ordered a medium and they were huge. If all you want is a knock around t-shirt for work or exercise, they are fine, but certainly no fashion statement."
4,Get a larger size,Great shirt and holds up after washings. It does shrink a bit so get one size bigger. I got the dark pink and it was the same color as in the picture.
5,Good historical Christian novel.,"A good read about the ""the frontier"" and the settling of it. This book demonstrates God's faithfulness even when people put Him on hold and in the background of our lives. He is always there if only we remember. I would highly recommend this book and will be looking for other novels to complete the series."
4,Decent,"It was a nice, easy read that wasn't predictable. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
3,Ruby,Abrupt ending. Didn't make sense. I wouldn't recommend this book. I won't be purchasing from this series. Kept waing for climax
3,Pretty good - enjoyed the early Norwegian settlers references,"Mom found the book in their library and loved the names of the girls, Ruby with sister Opal, since that's her and her sister's names. So I had to download it from Amazon for my Kindle. It had a lot of references to Norwegian life back in North Dakota that she heard her ""bestamor"" (grandma) talk about over the years. It was pretty consistently entertaining reading through most of it - and at the end there is a strong Christian message. I ordered her the next two in the paperback series, Pearl and Opal."
4,"Good, Easy Read","""Ruby Torvald sets out on a daunting journey with her young sister, Opal, to hopefully see their long-lost father once more and claim the promised inheritance. But instead of the treasure they expected, the sisters discover something most shocking."" (book back)I have always liked Lauraine Snelling's books. This one was no exception. I love how easily the pages flow and how you want to just keep reading every time you pick it up. The character of Ruby felt a lot like me in that she could get so wrapped up in the day-to-day and the worries and stresses of the day-to-day that she overlooks some of the good. For good or bad, I tend to do that as well. This made her character more human to me. I felt like the book ended a little flat, however, I am planning on reading the next 3 in the series and I hope that it will pick up some of the things this one left off.All in all, if you are looking for a good, easy read, this is a good book for you!"
2,Needs work,"I very much wanted to enjoy this book, but it was definitely lacking. The story line meandered around, but didn't really get anywhere. I have no problem with religious content, but it seemed to be gratuitous and didn't flow with the plot. There were inconsistencies which didn't make any sense. I did however, stick with it all the way to the ending, just to be disappointed that there really was no closure."
3,Ruby,"I started Ruby 4 times and almost put it aside but am glad I stuck with it. I was glad when the story really started. Standing up to ones beliefs, patience, hard work, judging, faithfulness to God, all of these are attributes we all need to look at in our own life. Good light reading book."
3,Ruby,Enjoyed this very much. God can use broken and battered lives if you are willing to give Him a chance.
4,Ruby,Ruby was a very good book.......would recommend it to anyone looking for a good book....It was a very inspiring story
4,Pretty good.,"Pretty good book from the beginning. I did find the end was a little slow, lost a little intrest towards the ending, but all in all pretty good. Got it for free when it was available, cant go wrong with that :)"
4,Great Story; Not So Great Ending,"I downloaded this book as a freebie, and I was pleasantly surprised. The story was good; the characters were believable; and it appeared that an editor actually looked at it. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I expected more plot development between Rand and Ruby, but it didn't happen. I was hoping for some kind of epilogue - that didn't happen either. I actually tried scrolling past the last page to see if, by chance, there was something else that would help ""wrap up"" the ending. Maybe the fact that Amazon has made the book unavailable right now means that they're adding that epilogue (I can hope)."
5,A Surprise!!,"A long ago story of Ruby, who cares for herself and her nine year old sister by working for the well-to-do Branson family as a tutor and housekeeper. She receives a letter from her father saying he is dying and wants her to travel to see him before his death to collect their inheritance. It's a book of her faith, courage and triuamph. It's a book you won't want to put down."
4,Ruby,It was a nice series. I have read Snelling before and enjoyed her books. Her family connection in the series worked well.
2,There is something missing in this misleading story.,"""Ruby"" reads like an incomplete thought. I do understand this is book one in a series (which seems to have trivial gem theme name protagonists), but relationships were formed and we didn't see them mature. Since the rest of the series picks up with a different character, we lose the relationship we had with Ruby, therefore abandoning the little information and emotions we felt. The religious aspect of the story was overflowing, smothering, and uncalled for, since no reason was touched upon to have it. This book is labeled as a historical fiction, when a religious historical fiction label would have been apt, so it was poor marketing. Because I know so little about the characters, I have no desire to move on in the series. I do not feel that there was a big enough cliffhanger to pull me in. I do not recommend."
3,Good Until the End,"I love historical Christian fiction, and this book was as entertaining a read as any.....until the end. The ending left me feeling frustrated. My initial response was, ""What?!"" I couldn't believe it ended so abruptly and left so many loose ends. Maybe there's a sequel in which the unanswered questions will be answered? I certainly hope so, otherwise I will not be looking for anymore of this author's work, I am sad to say."
2,"Started it, couldn't finish it, bad formatting/font choice","I started this book, the description sounded intriguing, but found the formatting to obnoxious to continue reading. I tend to set my kindle at a larger font size and the use of justification, coupled with the non-standard font chosen was very irritating to read. I attempted to set a different font, but found I couldn't. I wish there was an option to turn of justification (what is so awful about a right ragged margin??)."
5,Makes you feel like you are there.,"Being a North Dakota native this book brings back a feeling of home. The descriptions of the badlands are wonderful. The main character, Ruby, is a strong independent woman who you find your self feeling for, laughing with and cheering on. This book is worth picking up."
2,kattywatty,"Liked parts of this book...but the main character seemed so very naive....so much so it hurts the story. And the fonts used just sucked. When she was thinking to herself...the font used for that was just awful, nine times out of ten it was hard to figure out. Then there is the religious part, and while I consider myself a believer, these chapters to me were long,drawn out, and uninteresting. I won't read more by this author."
5,"Ruby is a ""Gem"" of a Book","It is always a delight to find a new writer and a new series to read. Just finished ""Ruby"" and immediately started reading ""Pearl"", #2 of the Dakotah Treasures series.The main characters are all likeable -- well, one isn't but I won't tell you which one that is. I do enjoy *good* Christian novels and at first I wondered how the ""Dove House"" plot was going to work without becoming overboard preachy. But the writer accomplished that and then some.As the scenes unfold and the characters become more real - and that includes Ruby herself - we find Ruby challenged physically, emotionally, and spiritually. For me personally the highlight of the book was the explanation of the Bible verses ""Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me."" I so enjoyed this book."
5,great first book,"I found this book in my local library and after reading it had to order it.I found it to be exciting and the characters are great.I look forward to others in the series,"
3,Annoying sister!,"I'm not finished reading Ruby, but I have to say that the younger sister, Opal, is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in fiction. I don't think her character is realistic. Opal ranks with Harriet Oleson from Little House, except Opal's probably worse."
2,Not romantic!,"I enjoy reading to relax and get away from stress! This book is not happy, no romance but it does have a great story on redemption."
3,Ruby,"This was a good story, well told, entertaining. But I prefer that there be more positive action and less ""my fault"" stories."
5,book,"Another book that I hated to put down, I loved the book and wanted to read the next one, so I bought it, I haven't started it yet, but as soon As I finish the one i am reading now I will start on the next one in the series"
4,Ruby,"The book was interesting. I enjoyed reading the story. It leaves things unfinished, but I suppose that is left for the next stories"
3,And we're done,This had all the makings of a really good book. Realistic characters with human flaws and weaknesses who developed a bond By working together and in many ways saving each other. There was even a potential love triangle blooming. And then BOOM! The story is over. Umm.. What happened? Why spend all that time developing characters like Rand and Cimarron (and even Ruby) and then not tell us what happens to them?It really felt like the author got tired of writing and just decided to end it after partially tying up one of the many story lines that were going. Unfortunate since they were interesting story lines.
5,Love Ruby!!!!`,"I love this book. I cannot wait to read the next one in the series. Ruby, Opal, and the ""girls"" are amazing. I was so addicted to this book. I could not put my Kindle down!! I had to know what happened next. Loved it!!"
4,Suprised and delighted,"I downloaded this book as a sort of filler as I didn't have the funds to purchase anything I actually wanted to read. It was just meant to hold me off until I got something else, however even as I downloaded a few other books this past week I found myself returning to Ruby over and over until it was done. It is not my normal fare but the simple way of writing, the genuine emotions, and the beautiful characters had me hooked. I don't normally read Christian books but I have to say there was just the right amount of faith. Going to go download the rest now!"
3,Good book until the end,"I really liked the sisters and the manner in which the author portrayed them as proper ladies. When they were thrust into ownership of a brothel in the middle of nowhere, it was almost comical as to the naivete of Ruby. I really wanted her to get hooked up with Rand but the author just stopped the book. I felt like I was in the middle of a sentence and then it ended. Hoping to pick up the story in the continuation of the series."
4,Ruby,I have started to read L.S. books with a passion and I truely love them. The characters have great depth with many turns to keep you interested. I liked the unusual setting Ruby was put in and how she dealt with it. Her overly calm ways sometimes had me wanting to jump into the book to straighten the way she was treated by some but I guess that made it all the more interesting.My only comment is that I felt left hanging in the end. I realize that the author wants you to buy the next book and I did but I would have liked a more complete ending.
2,Not sure anything happened...,"I started reading the book, found something more interesting, and eventually came back to it. Like many other reviewers, I hate leaving a book unread. I wanted to like it. It had some great potential, but the story just seemed to plod along with no real determination or goal. No clear antagonist showed up, so there was no reason to root for the supposed heroine (who was far too naive to be believable). And when the story ended I couldn't help but say, ""That was it?""I won't be reading any further books in this series."
5,Great Read !,I thoroughly enjoyed this book and living the adventures of Ruby at the Dove House... it kept you captivated . I felt like I was there with Ruby and her little sister. Can't wait to read Pearl!
5,Ruby,This is a book that kepts you very involved the story. This book is one that I will read again and have already shared with others to read. I would like to know the names of the other two that is in this series.Merle Hardee
3,Not impressed,"I usually enjoy books written in that era but not this one. I made myself finish it and it doesn't feel like it really ended. I understand it's a book one in the series but it did not leave me as a reader for wanting for more, but wanting to see some stories wrapped up. There is a difference. I did not like the main character (the way she was portrayed) and even though the main idea is following God's guidance, this book did not ""sit right"" and I know I won't be reading other two in this series."
2,Disappointed expected more.,I was disappointed with the ending. I expected two or three more chapters to complete the parts of the story left unfinished.
4,Good story,"A touching tale of two sisters as they find their way,anew life and friends. I liked it but the ending left u hanging it just stopped but not finished."
2,Meh ending,Kept waiting for some kind of climax...Who was/is the love interest?And then an ending that just seemed like it was pulled out of the blue because the author had a deadline to meet. Cant believe people found a way to give this 5 stars.MEH!
2,written on a low reading level,I just could not get past the fact the writing style sounds like something written for the Junior Reader section that my middle school daughter would read.
2,decent until the end,"This was an okay read through most of the book, and then I got to the end. It was as if the author got bored with writing the book and decided to just stop. It was such an abrubt stop that I actually went back to the Amazon order page to check the page numbers in the book. I was convinced my tablet froze in the download process and there were chapters I had missing. Why put in a whole plot line about possible romance with one guy, and a clear tension that looked like it would become romance with another, and do NOTHING with either? It was like that whole story line in the book had been forgotten along with a few others. It looks like the next book is about a completely new character, so it appears there will be no resolution. I will not be paying to find out. Oh, and the all of a sudden religious overkill at the end was too much for my taste. Unsure as to how this book received so many great reviews."
3,Compelling until the end,"I enjoyed this book. The author created well-developed characters and I found them believable. The content was educational, as well as emotional. I found the book hard to put down and read late into the night.My only problem with the book was the ending. The author seemed to get up on the pulpit for a good preachy finish. In addition, the ending was very abrupt."
4,Good fiction with history tied in,Really gives you a good story with insight to the challenges of establishing a life in unsettled territory.History with a solid fiction to keep it interesting
5,Want to read more of series,Grabbed my attention from page one. and made me want to keep reading more. Told my daughter to read it
3,Well......,"Can't say I am going to get the next in this series. Honestly I kept eating for something to happen. Something that would make me think that the book was going to turn around. Ruby, though admirable and stubborn (qualtiies I admire) was just to stuck in her ways to see the blessing around her. I was literally I. The last pages before I started to think she would turn her attitude around and be a Chirstain women.The trails just kept going and going and going for 318 pages. The last 2 were good."
3,just a bit of fluff to pass the time,this was an ok story - nothing more than to pass the time as far as I'm concerned. By the time I got to the end I was skimming. Ruby was just too naive for words----How could you live in a Brothal for several weeks and not know what it was? Even the prim and proper ladies of that time knew what Brothels were about. I also agree w/ one of the reviews that the book just ended....nothing was brought to a conclusion. The story had no point and no message.
2,Stilted writing,"I realize this author is prolific and well-loved in her genre, and maybe I am just not overly into the overwrought style of ""Christian romance,"" but I found this to be quite poorly written, with stereotypical characters. A real chore to get through. If you are interested in historical fiction, find another author."
3,So so.,"There wasn't any form of closure. Maybe she just wants you to read the series. I thought it was lacking. Didn't like how naive Ruby was. It wasn't horrible, but i was expecting more."
5,Ruby,I enjoyed the character development and the focus on the challenges of living in a less civilized environment --more realism than romance.
3,Feels unfinished.,"Really liked the story and the characters. The ending just kind of dropped you, the story seemed unfinished. I thought I skipped over some pages. All these subplots started but left without resolution."
4,Well written,I really am enjoying this series. The stories are well written and I find myself imagining living in the pioneer days throughout the books. The characters are interesting and I really like how parts of true history are weaved into the daily lives of these people. I will continue this series to the end! Thank you
2,I've waited for months......,"I am so disappointed. I was so excited to read this book. I have read all of the Red River of the North, the Return to Red River and Daughters of the Confederacy books. I was raised in North Dakota. I LOVED all of the other books. This one lacks description of the area, the characters, the location, the time period, the heat, the clothing, the main building, and I could go on and on. I have been to the Medora area several times, but I don't think Mrs. Snelling went there once. It seemed like she was assuming too much of her readers. The story line was very predictable compared to her past books. I will read the other two books that are supposed to be in this series, but this was a totally unexpected disappointment. Sorry, maybe the next one will fill in the gaps."
1,A student who was required to work through the whole book,"This textbook is disconnected and poorly organized. The authors of each chapter are so absorbed in their own work that they don't seem to remember that the text is supposed to be for a multidisciplinary audience. The problem sets are hit or miss, and in some cases the solutions are not supported by the text (if you relied on the text alone, you couldn't solve the problems). The biomechanics and biomaterials chapters are good, but the imaging, fluids and mass transfer chapters are lacking. If you want a good, broad bioengineering text, you should look for the Ratner book instead."
3,Lame textbook,"I used it as one of my graduate level classes. I feel it is a really mediocre textbook. Not even well balanced among different chapters. It should change its name to bio-mechanics rather than bio-engineering. But my instructor recommend it, never understand why? Only because it was written by some Berkeley guys? It is a stupid excuse."
3,Bliss,"What attracted me to Sunday was the pairing of David Suchet (Poirot) & Lisa Harrow (a lady from NZ in several roles from UK TV to international cinema) in a film as opposed to TV.Then it was selected by Redford's Festival Sundance. It is serious drama, set in NY,and is gripping viewing.I will view it a second time as it takes time to absorb.This is a film for those prepared to listen & absorb, rare today as it lacks cops, bombs & the seemingly popular violence on screen. Be brave, tackle it!RegardsDavid Baxter."
2,A must miss,"I don't know folks, but I just really couldn't get into this film. Sure it was full of the blue-grey world of despair, full of careless un-truths, full of boredom. Is that a good reason to go rent or buy a movie? I just don't think so. Maybe I'm not ""artsy"" enough to appreciate this film. But I try to apply the ""if it sounds good it is good"" measure to the films I watch, and in those terms this film was a bust."
1,map scale,"it would be helpful to understand whether the map scale is 1:2000,000 which is said to be the scale that shows the major and all the minor roads"
1,Fraud,"This book is a fraud! It purports to be a facsimile copy of the original book. In fact the book was OCR scanned, and this is an unformatted printout of the resulting file. Chapter titles and headings are embedded in the text, without change of font, and may appear 2/3 the way down a page. Moreover, there are enormous numbers of transcription errors. It is very hard to read. The ""publishers"" of this edition should be burned at the stake."
5,Ubiquity,"What else to say ?It's ubiquity made, quality guarantee.Pure mambo straight from end to end..."
4,Shows with Guest Stars,The episodes are wonderful. But I'd like to know who is guest starring on ea. tape before purchasing.
4,True Country Delta Blues,"I like 'Big River Blues'! Being raised in the early 50's and 60's in Biloxi, Mississippi, I grew up listening to this music, from the worksongs I would hear the chain gangs sing to the simple single string slide playing my old neighbor would play, that would make the hair stand up on my neck. This music might not be eveyones cup of tea ( Sonny Bono ? I dont think so ), but to me and my own humble opinion, it stands right up there with anything today in this style. The more I listen to it with Bukka White, Son House,& Blind Willie McTell , the more I like it."
1,Big River Blues,"I would not recommend this CD to anyone. If your looking for the Delta Blues/Country Blues, this is not it. What a letdown. I'll keep buying the old Prewar stuff. I took a gamble on this one and was truely disappointed. It sounds like someone turn on a tape player and recorded somebody playing around. Just a letdown considering the title of some of the songs."
4,Hey there Folks !!!,"Hey there,, this is Dusty Sommers here...I hope Life is treating y'all well!!I just wanted to let ya know the last review was from a wonderful lady in NC,Lori,, funny story,, she wanted to review it this past summer,, but dident have a amazon account,,, so I said 'please be kind' lol and gave her my pass code.. little did we both know it would look like Im reviewing my own CD LOL...forgot about the cookies,,and her not clicking the anonymous button,,hehehe....but,,,,its low tech,, and today, knowing what I know now,, and the simple tricks Ive learned.. it would'ent sound so 'rough' ;)....but theres only a few left...and I've cut the price down ... so grab it .. 'cause when its gone,,,thats it.. ;) check out the new one,,,,You'll like it!!!take care..and thanks for your support!Dusty"
1,don't get fooled again!,"Dusty Sommer's ""singing"" would make Sonny Bono's fans cringe. ""OH LORDY LORD LORD"" (He actually sings this!). This is so cornball and his slide guitar playing, which is almost passable, is so far back in the mix that this effort is not ""raw"", but more like inept! please don't get ripped off as I did after seeing an ad the the Allman Brothers fanzine ""Hittin' the Note"" for this CD. For Delta style slide fans, better stick to the old timers or the ""new wave"" of electric/acoustic sytle players."
5,I'M STILL GROWING VOL.1,This book of poetry is an excellent buy!Portionte` Floes has discovered a modern form of poetry!I've read my copy 5 times to date. Its just that powerful!GET THIS BOOK!!!
4,It was a pretty good summer reading book.,"It was really good. It took me about an hour to read because I was soooo into it and i am a fast reader. It had a very suprising ending. It was, like, you thought he was..... oh.... never mind... don't want to give the ending away.... Well, anyway, read this book. It is great!"
4,"""Bad Moonlight"" has its faults, but is otherwise very good.","In some parts, this book can be confusing. But it still leaves youon the edge of your seat just as any decent Stine book would. Lotsof suprises! :-)"
4,Bad Moonlight,"Bad Moonlight was a very good book. It was very suspensful. I just picked this book up, not knowing what it was about, but then I got into it and it was really good."
3,Bad.,"Bad Moonlight was really dumb. Just like the last reviewer, the book was pretty good before the ending. The plot was intriguing, and mysterious. But once I reached the ending, I was thoroughly disappointed. It was a dumb, very unrealistic, goofy way to end a Fear Street book, much less a Super Chiller."
3,It was.......,I hated this book because it was to gross. the plot was good but it was too descriptivly disgusting. i like most of RLstines book but he has too make the ending diferent. i always know who the killer is before the end of it. got to work harder.
1,THIS WAS NOT ONE OF R.L. STINE'S BEST BOOKS!!,I was very bored with this book and wanted to put it down. But I really wanted to know how it ended. I think the plot was just really stupid. I almost wasted my money on this book.
4,It was good but....,this book was good (tip to other kids watch spelling!)it realy is but it's definetly NOT R.L.'s best!
2,yes his name is stepney .,stepney gets saved from scrap from rusty . thomas and percy make good time with girls. thomas and percy deliver the mail . its over dont waCTH IT OK ? .....
2,Poor quality DVD's,"The quality of the DVD's were very bad. The movies kept starting and stopping. I cleaned the DVD player but it made no difference. The previews of other movies (trailers at the beginning) worked fine; it was only the movies themselves that had problems. And my other DVD's work just fine. I only had problems with this two pack DVD, The Ark of Truth and Continuum."
4,Stargate Fans Will Enjoy These Films,Both movies continue in the Stargate tradition of good writing and acting. Don't hesitate to add these to your collection.
4,You new realize how blind you were until you see the light,"I just receive my Eye-One LT in the mail and put it to work right away. The color are amazing. I've never heard of monitor calibration until a few days ago after taking a fine art printing class using CS3. I guess the instructor was right when he said that if you wanna get what you see on your screen to come out of your printer you have to calibrate your monitor. Needless to say I'm very satisfied with the product. i will recalibrate my monitor with it every 2 weeks.As you can see I only give it a 4 star rating because, like it's said in previous reviews, the software disk that came with the Eye-0ne LT is outdated and worthless. [...]."
4,It looks good.,"I purchased one to calibrate multiple displays in my home. Calibrating computer monitors is very quick and easy with the included software. With just a few clicks the automated process begins. When it's finished, your display has bright, vibrant coloring. Very pleasing to the eye, but I have no method of checking accuracy other than ""it just looks right"".It's construction seems a little on the cheap side, and they should have made the counterweight attachment stronger or included a storage compartment for it in the unit itself. I'm sure it will be lost the next time I need to use it."
1,Very frustraiting,I can live with a cumbersome software but what's much worse is every attempt to calibrate my monitor yielded a very crappy looking picture with a pronounced color cast. Absolute waste of money.Monitor: BenQ 241WOS: Win7 32 & 64 bit
3,"Great tool, but I bought the software upgrade","The Eye-One LT can become an Eye-One Display 2 through a firmware update which then unlocks additional software features. The firmware update costs around double the price difference between the LT and the Display 2. If you are a casual user wanting to go cheap, the Eye-One LT is for you. If you're a tweaker, save yourself time and money and buy the Eye-One Display 2.With that said, the tool worked quickly and easily on my HP LP2475W, MacBook Pro, and Dell D620. The picture quality was dramatically improved. The best picture on the MacBook Pro did come after upgrading to the Display 2 so that I could use the native color temperature of the MBP. It also allows calibration of brightness.In my opinion, it was worth it. Some of my older pictures look better than ever and now I know that what I'm seeing on the screen is what it's supposed to look like."
1,Horrible,"I bought this, and because my computer monitor is on an iMac, I can't get the white point right. My calibrations always turned out VERY red. When I asked xrite, they now want me to spend $99 on an upgrade. Their product isn't working, and I'm expected to shell out another $100 for it?! THAT'S INSANE! I'm not happy with xrite, and I'm NEVER buying their brand again. I won't want to chance it not working, and having to spend more money on a product that I had a set budget for!"
4,Very Happy,"I used this product with the Color HCFR program to calibrate my HDTV. For this purpose it did a wonderful job and I couldn't be happier.However, the program that comes with it is absolutely horrendous. I attempted to use it to calibrate my computer monitor. It did it automatically, and when it was done it was so bad that it hurt my eyes. It was way to bright, and while it said the color was ""balanced"" it was waaayyy to blue.While this would be a 5 star product, the included software is so bad I could only give it 4 stars.However, if you plan on using the Color HCFR program to calibrate your HDTV or monitor, I believe this product is very hard to beat for the price."
1,Waste of time - useless product made screen worse,"I spent too much time with this product as it continued to make my screen colors worse than when I started. Little documentation, weak bloated software and 5 tries, even with different computer screens (I have 5 I wanted to match). This product is a waste. I noticed it's made by X-Rite, who also makes the Huey. Another weak product. When will there be a GOOD color/screen calibration product??"
1,Vista-64 Driver Struggle. Throw Installation Disk in Trash,Step #1: Take a pair of pliers and twist the included installation disk until it breaks and then throw it in the trash. You will be far ahead if you do.Step #2: Go to these web sites and download the latest software.http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx?ID=758&Action;=support&SoftwareID;=724http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx?ID=789&Action;=support&SoftwareID;=768Step #3: Install the application software. Then make a subdirectory in the application folder called USB Drivers. Copy the drivers from the second link above into the USB driver folder.Step #4. Go to the control panel and click install hardware. Select the USB driver folder to pick the appropriate driver.Step #5: Rename the stupid GretagMacbeth program startup folder to something logical like Eye-One Display.Step #5: Restart your computer. That should do it.
2,Sounds cooler than it is.,I couldn't see much of a difference other than just adjusting your brightness and contrast settings manually. It wouldn't even offer my monitor's default setting (9500) as an option.
1,Useless after a few years,"When it was new, it worked fine. I used it to calibrate my computer and 2 TVs with satisfactory results.However, be aware that the device will age and drift rapidly, renders it pretty much useless after 2-3 years. Mine from about 3.5 years ago has drifted so far out of spec that calibration done using it have extremely obvious color flaws. If your monitor came this way you would've returned it, trust me, it's that bad.Had I known that this device have such short life span, I would've never made the purchase. $150 is NOT cheap for a one time use device.Researching further on avsforum's display calibration section, you can correct the drift somewhat if you have access to a more expensive spectrometer.My Harbor Freight tool costs significantly less, and lasts significantly longer. Shame on your X-Rite."
2,Very hit or miss on the readings of my LCD.,"Purchased this product for a DIY home theater lcd calibration. I got varied readings from session to session and even between devices. I understand LCD's in general can be tough to gauge even for high end colorimeters, so I don't know if it's really a flaw with this product or just a bad application for it. I also used it on my laptop and it seemed to do a better job there which is what it's most widely used for, but didn't seem to make a big difference. I really wish it came with a color sheet or something you could compare what the screen has to what it ""should"" be.Ultimately I wound up sending it back and selling the second on the marketplace here. In retrospect, I think I may have had unrealistic expectations for the product."
4,Calibration made easy,"I know some folks hate this product or its too slow or what not. I use it to calibrate my tv's at the house. I do not use the software that comes with it. I use the colorHCRF software (plus using the latest drivers for the Display LT). It performs very well, readings are pretty accurate. But you need to know how to use it for the specific application you are going to use the Display LT for. When I first tried it and used the disc it came with, it was frustrating at first. It will take some time getting used to it. But like I said before, I use another software to establish the things I need out of it. Price is actually darn good"
4,"Excellent Price, Excellent Product",The Eye one does exactly what it says - calibrate your monitor so what you see is what you get when you make prints. I would have given it 5 stars if the directions were a bit clearer. But just using the defaults brings you very close to perfect prints. Note: you must download the paper/printer profile from the manufacturer of the paper to get excellent quality prints to match your monitor.
4,X-Rite Eye-One Good Value,"The X-Rite Eye-One works well for calibrating displays and is much less than competing options. It is not a ""one click"" deal - you have to setup the screen properly to get a calibration, but it is workable. This unit calibrates monitors only, you have to buy more stuff if you want to calibrate printers, scanners, etc."
3,"good, not great","Simply, this item does not fit the 2007 Rav4 all that well. There is a gap of 1/2 - 1 inch on either side of the front liners, which will just be full of snow/ice/slush come winter. For the ridiculous price of what amounts to a piece of moulded rubber, I expect these to fit.The liners for the 2010 Altima fit much better. Somehow, they got this one wrong."
5,I liked the brown globules.,"Most of the people reviewing say ""I dont want to ruin the book for you"" but I think I'll be a jerk and tell you. hehehe. It is about an alien named ax (he's pretty weird). He goes to the movies and crawls on the ground sayin ""Brown globuels Imust have Brown Globules(Brown globuels are choclate).Anyways the yeerks are dying cause of lack of kandrona rays. Axteams up with a yeerk to stop visser 3. Ax turns into a snake and bites visser 3 on the leg and poisons him. the yeerk visser 3 crawles out of his head and jumps in the lake.They try to save the andelite but they can't.So the animorphs get away end of story."
5,The First Ax Book,"This is the first ""Ax"" book of the Animorphs series. I have to say it's one of the funniest Ax books. You get to see his opinion on humans, and at the end you also meet Ax's parents (kind of) and find out about Seerow's Kindness.(See the Hork-Bajir Chronicles)It is a definate must-read for a begining Animorph fan, and even if you've read the whole series, you'll still get a few laughs out of this one!"
4,This is the funniest Animorphs book that I've read,It's funny when Ax trys popcorn and eats the box and then wanders off to find some more. But he finds some other food instead.This is one of my favorite Animorphs books.Now I am reading #12. It sounds cool!
5,Way Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(And Funny),"Anyone who's never read THIS book should, well, get startin'! And Katherine Applegate: <YOU GO, GIRLFRIEND!>"
4,Great book that could use some work.,I have read almost all the animorphs books. This was the first time i thought Applegate might turn into R. L. Stine. The dog android and the marble sized re programmer were pretty flaky but this was still a breathtaking book for youn adults. If you like animorphs buy it. Feel free to E-mail me if you want to.
5,An enjoyable book I would recommend it for 10-15 year olds,"Ax is my favourite animorph he is realy an andalite,which is an alien who's lower body like a dear, upper body of a human, tail of a scorpion and a head with no mouth and three incisions to replace his nose, elf like, pointy ears, stalk eyes and is coloured blue.I won't tell you about the story it will give the action away.Buy the book and read it."
3,"Interesting,","I know Animorph readers are going to haunt me in my sleep forthis but, these books are not exzactly super and wonderful and allthat. I like to read novels and loooong 401 page books though. There is nothing wrong with these books but they're one of those series, like BabySitters Club, but before you hunt me down and attack me, listen, er more or less read, these books are great, I love them they're interesting and captivating, but I suppose my standers are a little to high for my own good. Katherine A. Applegate, keep writing, readers keep reading and I'll be right there with you."
5,"Two Words, very cool","this book is just full of surprises. i loved it. if you like the animorphs youl love this one. my favorite part is when they go up from the underground complex to see rachel being, well youl have to find out for yourself."
5,Ax's first book in the series,"When Elfangor's little brother, Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill, was saved by the Animorphs, he didn't have much to tell them. In this book, he sees what happens when the feeding schedule for the Yeerks is sabotaged. Every free host is killed. Now Ax has to make a choice: Tell the other Animorphs all he knows and break the law of Seerow's Kindness, or be banished from the Animorphs.... This is a great book about choices. All kids will love the humor Ax doesn't mean to do. Please read this book. And find the Andalite in you..."
5,Great book,This is a great book about choices. Choices wether to tell something important and break the secred oath of serow's kindness or keep a secret that could endanger his freinds. Ax has to make this choice when he finds out all free hosts are being killed. A great book for almost all ages. I highly recomend it.
4,The Alein's view,"I think this is another great Ani book. It is the first book told by Ax and it captures his views on humans very well. It is good fun to see how another speices might see us. In this book Ax want's to know more about humans, so first Jake and Marco take him to a movie, and then he goes to school! The results are very funny, espeicaly when it involves popcorn or chocolate! Then the Animorphs discover yeerks are dieing because they destroyed the Kandrona (book #7) and are starving. At first the Animorphs are pleased because they think the free hosts will tell everyone about the yeerks and they won't be alone fighting, but the yeerks kill the freed hosts. The Animorphs get mad at Ax for not telling them about this. At the start, there is also an interesting scene in the Andalite dome ship, just before they go into the battle with the yeerks that killed Elfangor. It's a great book with lots of laughs and a good storyline, and I recommend it and all the Animorph books."
4,<Humans do many things backwards> Not just for younger kids,"Even as a teenager nearing her end of the teens (i.e. 19 years of age) I have read and enjoyed most Animorph books. I started reading them to please my younger brother and to talk about them with him (nobody else seemed to want to) and ended up reading them for my own pleasure. They are really surprisingly well written for books of their kind.This specific one would have to be my favourite because of some of Ax' extremely funny comments in the begining of each chapter. One that always gets a laugh is this one in the beginning of chapter 9: ""Books are an amazing human invention. They allow instant access to information simply by turning pieces of paper. They are much faster to use than computers. Surprisingly, humans invented books before computers. They do many things backwards."""
5,What's going on in Ax's brain?,"What's Ax thinking when that happens? What's Ax thinking when this happens? Find out what Ax thinks, while he's with the Animorphs. Comes with two free bookmarks."
5,Humans still don't know how Andalites eat with their hooves,"Ax is trying to learn how to act like a normal boy, so he goes to a movie. But when he discovers candy it will be the last time he goes to a movie! But when Ax thinks he is playing a game on Marco's computer, he finds out that he made a program that can communicate with the Andalite home world..."
4,Darklight,"On a whim one evening I originally watched this movie on television. I liked it enough that years later when it finally came out on DVD I ordered it.The story moves rather slowly, but for anyone who is a bible buff, the history is very interesting. The story tells another possible version of Lilith's actions. Watch the movie, do some research and decide for yourself.I enjoyed it!"
4,"Finally, Darklight lights up my home...","After waiting for years, I am finally able to satisfy my craving for this film. I know it's not a great film, but it is one of those ones you see and don't forget. Everytime it was on I had to see it and every year I looked for it to come out for sale. While doing my annual check for films I've wanted but couldn't find, there it was. Finally, one off my list. However, I'm sure I'll be adding one back to replace it's spot in my revolving list of films I just wish someone would put out. It's campy, but a fun ride for sci-fi fans and general teen-aged boys like mine. Heck, I probably like it better than them."
3,Rancho Shocks,"The shocks showed up in good time, new as listed. Sealed packages containing hardware, however 1 rubber bushing was missing from 1 shock. PIA to find another in the shop when i needed it."
3,1/4 rounds,Tried the 1/4 inch rounds for the first time. Not bad but doesn't have the punch the 3/8 shots have when hitting a target. For most sling shot shooters I would stay with the 3/8 (30 cal) shot. Thanks
3,Too small,Did not have too much idea what 1/4 means before ordering. But now realized it is too small to be the bullets for my slingshots. 50-100% bigger would be ideal.
2,Too small,I have a sling shot to scare off unwanted brds on my roof. These pellets are too small to get a firm grip in the sling shot. I didn't want something that would hurt my roof but these do not have enough weight and size on them
3,They work,"They work, they're not special. Use a strong magnet to keep them together and you'll be happier at target practice."
3,Hard to rank,"This product is hard to ""rank"" as there are not too many sling shooter ammo makers; therefore, beggars can't be choosy. I am not a regular shooter; but I am a weapons hoarder. From what I see on t.v. with violence coming to neighborhoods with mainly rock throwing and bottle throwing with no guns, arrows, or spears involved...I felt that a sling shot (or as we call them something else in the south) and ammo would be a slight edge on rock and bottle throwers...a ""just in case weapon of choice""."
2,a difficult read,"Even with a B.S. degree in physics, I had a hard time keeping up with the mathematical and scientific details in this book. It is very hard reading."
3,Dora ty,I only got this Dora because the other Dora was sold thru another company. Now I wish I got the other one. My daughter does like this Dora but I think she would have been happier with the other one. As I said in my Boots review when Dora comes on she gets both Boots and Dora to watch it with.
2,"Horton may know his Java, but he's no teacher!","Although I think Horton's book is excellent for somebody with a firm background in C++, he attempts to teach abstract content with more abstracts, yet only to pile more abstrats on later! For example, he uses math too often in his logic, when other content will do.Other authors do a much better job at teaching the Java language by example, rather than boring the reader with meaningless math operations. (If you are hung up on math, why not use something that is ""real world"" since Java is a real world computer language.)I just can't recommend this book."
3,Not good,"I have previous programming experience in Visual Basic, Perl, and JavaScript. I found this book to be slow-starting and not hands-on enough. It had a good introduction to OOP, and I am sure it is chock full ofinformation, but it is not readable at all. More like an encyclopedia. I grew tired and stopped."
3,"No pain, no gain...","This book suffers from a phenomena that seems to pervade the ""instructional"" programming books that flood the market. Specifically, there are many errors and omissions.Catch 22: If you know the language, these errors and omissions would be obvious, but I assume you bought the book to learn the language, so...New languages are difficult enough to learn, especially ones as complex as java, without having to figure out things the author left out or incorrectly stated. At least the code examples should be checked for accuracy and correctness!The final blow is that the site where you are supposed to be able to download the code examples returned a 404 Not Found error message - what happened to www.wrox.com?If you do struggle through all this, you will have a better understanding of java, but the cost is high!"
4,Great for self-study,"At the moment, I have neither the time nor financial resources to go out and take a Java class at the local JC. Of the four books I've tried to use in order to teach myself the language, this one has, by far, been the most helpful. It goes through EVERYTHING step-by-step and is exhaustive in its information. A little too exhaustive for my taste. I'm a little annoyed by the structure of the book (Applets are discussed near the last half and are only glossed over) but it provides an education that allows one to grasp new concepts quickly. One should definitely try to get a grasp on the Object Oriented programming model before diving into this book, though."
5,Excellent tutorial for Object-Oriented programming in Java,This book is the best book I ever read!!!. The Author explaint the Document/View architecture so deep and clear. I applied this idea on my two big Java projects and it works excellent.I agree that half part of this book is not for beginner. The people who can understand this book will need strong Object-Oriented programming experience.
1,The worst book I have read on Java,I have read many books on java and this is the worst of all for the following reasons: 1) You can not understand a new idea from a 10 page example. 2)It doesn't describe the 1.0.2 event model and the description of the 1.1 event model is really very very confusing!!! 3)Applets are examined very very briefly! 4)The description of the AWT model is also confusing due to the very big examples.
2,"Hard to follow, very wordy.","I have read several books on Java, this one seemed to me to be the most confusing. I would not suggest this book to anyone other than a seasoned programmer. NOT a good entry level text. The examples were semi informative"
2,Definately Not for beginners,The author definately knows what he's talking about yet he teaches Java as if his audience were genius rocket scientists. This is a good book to come back to once you've got a firm grip on Java. This book is definately not for beginners; very steep learning curve.
2,Not a book for beginners,I absolutely agree with the reader from Austria. Don't buy this book if you have no or little programming experience. Plus this book is not very readable because the writig style is not concise and to the point.
3,The first half of the book is for beginners.,"Everything in the book prior to the chapters on event handling and the document/view architecture is for beginners. Once you've gotten past the first half of the book, there is a wide gap in the required experience level for someone to continue on. It gets very confusing. Buy this book, but buy another one to help you to fill in that gap."
3,"Starts off okay, and goes downhill from there.","This book starts out very understandable and informative, however, once he gets into his chapters on handling events, he introduces way too many new topics at once in his examples before he explains them. Most times after an example, he gives a less than thorough explanation of the things introduced in the example. I'd have to agree that this is not a book for beginners."
3,Not for beginners,"Beginning Java is definitely not for beginners. Although I had programming experience I was unable to follow the book after chapter 7. I didn't like the structure of the book and the fact that the writer starts writing an example and enhancing it in every chapter instead of having many small examples. Also, there were few examples on applets. If you want to save 40 dollars don't buy this book."
1,Beginning Java,"1. Bad examples all through. Author concedes at places that the examples are bad or could be better.2. Too long sentences. By today's standard, a sentence 5 lines long is bad. And also the English style is bad.3. He tries to avoid jargon at places which confuses things. I am talking about the chapter on Exceptions. You have to call a unchecked exception a unchecked exception. If you try to beat around without calling it by the name, the reader is confused.4. Moreover, there is a later version of the same book. So why this one....5. But I concede two issues. One the book taught me Java (or an iota of it). Two, trying to understand the book at places was fun."
1,Excelent!,"Good book, a must read! Reviewer: A reader from San Francisco, CA November 10, 1998 Love the book. It explain (almost) everything clearly. There isn't enough discussion on applet though. The chapter on Input/output and JDBC is particularly helpful."
4,a great book,wonderful book on a great 20th century master ELK drawings a must to learn of this masters work and this book does the job
2,Not that Interesting,"I didn't find the stories that interesting or compelling. I'm glad I tried the book, but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,used book,"Item was listed as good used condition but the cover was dirty and the pages were stained, not what I would consider ""good"" condition."
3,I found this book very inspirational and easy to read!,"I found this book to be very inspirational. With it's short writings, it sisn't take long to read. You could read for a few minutes and be inspired all day long. I'm a 21 year old student, who also works. It's so hard to take time out of my busy schedule to spend with GOD. This book helped me do it."
3,Not quite as good as I remember,"About 20 years ago I was a born again fundamentalist christian and remember being inspired by this book. I recall being drawn into Max Lucado's narrative and anecdotal storytelling style. Perhaps because of the tough times I was facing as a young adult, it felt like I was ""on the anvil"". I since left that fundamentalist mindset behind and no longer had my old copy of the book. But I am interested in writing spiritual literature so I wanted to reconnect with that early inspiration. So I ordered the book again. Instead, this time I discovered a very young Max Lucado conveying contrived and simplistic stories and anecdotes. As if he was writing for gullible and naive people like the young man I was 20 years ago..."
4,The Most Important Book You Will Ever Own,"If there is a required text for the oboist, the Barret Method is it. The etude studies are a standard part of the repertoire for students of all levels, and have been reproduced in other method books as well. I do not know of an oboist who has not worked from this book. Every student has their own favorite exercise and etude, and all learn to live with the yellow volume. While it can seem oppressive at times, the preparation it provides is second to none. It is a must-have for an obosits at any level."
4,Great layout,"This book is excellent for anyone looking to improve their oboe playing. It is logically set up, with easy pieces at the beginning and advanced pieces as you move towards the end. It is also a great tool for those oboists wishing to challenge themselves. They can work their way through the book. I definitely recommend it!"
5,Buckwheat Pillow,"This medium sized buckwheaat pillow came with a fine muslin cover. I made a 16"" x26"" outer case to give it a finished look. The size is ideal for me. The buckwheat hulls make a heavier pillow, than down or foam or memory foam, so this size is more managable than larger standard would be. The magic for me of this pillow, is the buckwheat hulls ability to provide the perfect contour an elevation for my head. Now it's not as soft and cushy like most others, its firm, but one is able to micromanage your head and neck support perfectly.Mrcatalog"
3,It May Just Be This Supplier,The pillow didn't have as many buckwheat as I expected for the size of the pillow. The pill case seemed very thin I had to immediately put a pillow case on it for fear the hulls would work their way out. It would have been great to have a zipper to add or deplete the amount of hulls. When I received this particular pillow it smelled like mold or something similar maybe it was the case but I don't believe so. It could have laid around for a while and picked up an odo. The buckwheat pillows I've owned in the past never smelled like this. The price I can't complain about to much. I have shoulder issues and have trouble with comfortable positions when trying to sleep this pillow does the trick if I stuff it under my arm it molds to the contour of my shoulder and bingo slight or no pain. Enjoy your pillow.
4,Good sized buckwheat pillow.,The pillow was larger than other buckwheats I have. The casing seemed very thin and the buckwheat seemed much coarser than other pillows I've purchased. That may be because of the casing. I can't attest to anything about healing benefits.
2,Buckwheat Pillow,The pillow case it came in was a little too big. The buckwheat inside moves around too much. The other problem is the pillow case had a strong chemical smell to it. I aired it out for one week but the smell is still too strong to use it. I will try and change the pillow case if the smell doesn't go away.
5,3 Pack movie,"My daughter thinks the movies are very funny! She is a teen ager and hadn't heard of the movies, but saw some clips. Great present!"
1,DVDs no good nor working,"Hi,Please note the Rush Hour collections arrived on time but I took a lot of time to open and play them. Please note only one DVD was OK, Rush Hour 2 and 3 were not even playing. So overall the DVDs were not working / not good. It's just a waste of money If possible please mail me good working copies.thanksRajesh"
4,great fun read witha 7 year old,What can I can I say - Daniel Pinkwater is one of the best authors out there for this age group. Hi wry sense of humor make it a fun read from children and adults.
5,Remembering,"I have long searched for this book/story, it was one of many in a children's book I use to read to my son from many years ago. The book featured such stories as ""Eleanor Rigby"",which I would read then sing much to his delight, ""Why Spider has a Skinny Waist"", and of course ""Once Upon A Blue Moose"". I would animate many of the stories I read from this children's book, ""Once Upon A Blue Moose"" was no exception. He's twenty-six now, we are very close, wish I could find that book again all of the stories have and still do mean very much to me. I can't tell you how pleasing it was to see this story here, thank you for posting this story on Amazon"
5,A Perfect Production,"I bought this DVD when my son was 18 months. He has watched it over and over again until recently the DVD cracked. I then borrowed the Disney version of the Jungle Book for him from the local library. Surprisingly, he was not as interested... There is certain innocence in the movie that a little kid just loves!!! My son asked to watch this movie often. I'm buying a new copy and some other stories from this company."
1,I don't like it!!,I didn't like this jungle movie. The monkeys were nasty. The tiger is a meanie and he made me afraid. It was really nasty. I don't want to see that again!! Please send it back.
1,Beware!,"This a horrible cheap knockoff of the original movie. My wife bought it without realizing. The book by Kipling is public domain now so anyone can make it into a movie, but that doesn't mean they should. The graphics are terrible, but nothing is as bad as the soundtrack. Stick with the original and avoid this stinker. I think Shere Khan was behind this. We threw the thing into the trash to remove at least one of these from circulation."
1,Awful!,I thought this was the Jungle Book translated. It's NOT. The animation is ugly and the voices are annoying. Plus they don't sing and dance like in the Jungle Book. The message of this Spanish-language version is awful too. DON'T BUY IT!
1,Stick to the Disney version!!! THIS VERSION SUCKS!!!,"I'll keep this short and sweet,buy the Disney version,it costs more but well worth it!!! The prodution company of this peice of junk is named ""Jetlag Produtions"",how appropriate!!! Avoid this,I feel like I threw my $5.99 + tax out the window!!! I love annimation,but this is bottom-of-the-barrel stuff!!! THIS VERSION SUCKS!!!"
1,THIS IS NOT DISNEY-DO NOT BUY,"The ONLY reason I bought this was because I thought it was the Disney version. They make it look like the Disney version, which you can't find anywhere. The production is primitive, the dialogue is horrible and violent, talking about killing all the time. It has NO redeeming qualities. It is nothing you want your kids to see, and I could not even sell it used in good conscience. My copy ended up in the trash, where it belonged."
2,Not a patch on the Disney movie,"I bought this tape for my three year old thinking thatthis was the Disney version. Big mistake. The animation is not even close to the Disney standard, and the storyline lacks the polish of a Disney production. None of the little touches of comedy that children love exist in this fairly mediocre recreation of Kiplings classic. That being said, it is perhaps slightly closer to Kipling's version when compared to Disney. But then, if you are buying an animated cartoon for your child, I doubt if the focus should be on the original literary version!"
1,DO NOT BUY,This is a ridiculous version of the original. In my haste to actually find a copy of the real Jungle Book I purchased this. Be forewarned...DO NOT BUY.
1,RIP OFF!!! Read the Fine Print before deciding to buy!,"Not the original ""Classic"" Jungle Book! This is a ripped off version of the one we loved as children. Sure you can get it for $5, but it is so not worth it. I tried to return the unopened dvd, but to no avail, they would not offer a refund."
5,great cd,"The main reason i purchased this cd is for the song ""I pray we all be ready"". It is great. A powerful recording."
2,we need Van Damme to save the people of the free world,"Now, I went into this wanting to like it, I wouldn't have bought it otherwise, but you can want in one hand, and well you get the idea. Gone is the self aware tongue in check humor of the 1994 movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Instead we have this slow moving, not much martial arts for the first thirty minutes, movie that dosen't even realize that it is so silly. The Van Damme movie knew it was a joke, and succeded quite well, I should add. Here, we have gravity defying wire fu, but this one is supposed to be more ""realistic."" I love the term realistic, action movies are about as realistic as porno movies, weather it be Die Hard or the Transporter, in real life, this stuff dosen't happen."
3,A brief comment,"Not having played the original game I didn't come to this movie with any baggage. I note the game fans seem to hate it and have peppered it with one star reviews, but I enjoyed it. If you just turn off your cerebrum and enjoy the gut-wrenching action, the fine cinematography, and the well choreographed fight scenes, it's fine for a slow Sat. night when you're looking for something mindless but fun. The fight scenes are excellent, and at the end Kristin Kreuk has some nice wu-su pole techniques in addition to empty hand. The scenes of the young Chun Li with her father doing tai chi and kung fu at the beginning of the movie were nicely done too. It's all harmless fun and I didn't know enough about the original to get bent about all the changes from the original, and I'd give it three and a half stars if I could."
2,was there an actual script?(1.7/5),"where to begin with this.well,it wasn't the worst movie i have seen.i did expect more however.pretty lame action here and not very much of it.in my opinion also a lot of miscasting. i don't know What Chris Klein was doing here.i do know his acing was razzie worthy.come to think about it,his character was pretty pointless.Neil McDonough didn't really belong in the movie either.and Michael Clarke Duncan played the same role he always plays.Kristen Kruek is no doubt a talented actress,but i wonder if she read the script(if there was one)or if any body did.the only person who seemed to be decent was Moon Bloodgood and she was in an entirely different movie.for me,Street Fighter:The Legend Of Chun-Li is a 1.7/5"
3,Not bad for a video game adaptation,"Not bad for a video game adaptation, but that doesn't mean it's good... The plot is lame and the characters are utterly paperthin. But, it has alot of action which carries the movie up to a certain point. In regards to the action, none of it is ground breaking or impressive though it is competently executed. I found movies such as DOA which is more unapolgetically cartoony to be more enjoyable to watch, plus DOA had some hot women in it. I'm not sure why movies like this don't try to push the envelope in martial arts choreography more, as its about the only thing they have going for them."
3,Better than Van Damme's Street Fighter,"no doubt that the Street Fighter purists will be sorely disappointed in this movie. i'm an old school fan of the game as well as the cartoon series, but that doesn't make me want to hate on this film.it's not great. in fact, ""The Sauce is weak in this one."" LOL! but i still found it entertaining.Kristin Kreuk actually shines in the film, but she does so without the support of a single character in this movie. bad actors, weak storyline, and fight scenes that are too short. and yet the movie was still moderately entertaining. but i'm a fan of cheesy fight flicks, so take from that what you will.with such a weak plot and storyline, there just REALLY needs to be more fighting!but i have to take my hat off to Kristin Kreuk. she's not just a pretty face. she used what she had to work with and gave a great performance. shame on the rest of these clowns!"
1,street fighter the legend of chun li,why didn t they look for aa chinnese girl to pla chung li what the hell.
2,what is this i dont even,"Lots of people hated the original Street Fighter movie. I liked the movie, but I could see WHY they didn't like it. It took quite a few liberties with the source, but at least it was recognizable.This... I don't even know why the source was ignored so much. Chun Li is practically unrecognizable here - her story has been changed. If this movie was a original story, it would have been better (though the story and acting are still pretty hinky in parts), but as a Street Fighter movie, this was a wreck."
1,It gets one star because you can't give a half,"I rented it out of curiosity, I've been a fan of the video games but this movie is nothing like them. At least the first movie didn't destroy the story of the game. Chun-Li never does her fast kicks, needless to safe if you're curious then save your money. I wouldn't let someone rent it if I worked at blockbuster."
1,Now Street Fighter has a MK 2,"I'm a big Mortal Kombat fan and I am glad to see that street fighter has created a sequel that is almost as bad as MK 2. Chris Klien is by far one of the worst actors I have seen on the big screen. I wouldn't blame the editor more than I would have the director and caster, maybe the editor was trying to cover up bad fight scenes and poor camera angles. Acting was bad on a large scale almost making the movie a comedy. Now we have two bad sequels to two really good games."
5,Good movie,"Good movie, well presented, no gaps and smooth easy to follow storyline. Acting and personality interactions were all believable (allowing for the fact that this is a movie). Could easily be shown to kids from 10 to 90 yrs of age."
1,Poorly adapted again 2/10 part 2 is on the SFLCL blu ray reviews,"How did Capcom even approve of this and I'll just say this Capcom gave us arcade games such as Street Fighter II, Final Fight, Strider 1&2 Capcom gave us Resident Evil a bunch of awesome games but for them to approve this I mean I said the 1994 film should've had some script changes but this needed a overhaul. If you haven't seen this movie & think OH BOY ALL MY FAVORITE SF characters in a movie well they ain't here it's only got Chun Li played by Kristian Kreruk all I know about her is she plays on Smallville I don't watch that show Smallville can burn in h**l for all I care. It has Charlie Nash played by American Pie's Chris Klein yes you heard that right.Neal McDonough as M. Bison the guy from Desperat House wives I think don't watch that junk as well. I seen him in I Know who killed me he's a good actor but he's no M. Bison.Then you have a character played by Moon Bloodgood Maya Sunee that's not even in the game."
2,Street Sucker,"This movie sucks!! Vega and Bison look ridiculous, and their characters are such a non-sense!! Complete waste of time to watch this movie. No matter how cute you think Kristin is, not worth it!! 2 Stars for Kristin..."
1,pathetic...,"no words can describe how pathetic and disgusting this piece of garbage is.since everyone else told you WHY this movie stinks from their perspectives already then well,i'll just say this:DON'T spend your money on this movie,buy the game instead!!enough said..."
1,no ty,horrible movie. horrible story. horrible effects and all. the ONLY GOOD ACTOR was mike duncan green mile guy i feel bad that he was misled into the position. kruek i mean krook did a horrible job in EVERYthing. bottom line ur better off watching the first street fighter the effects are about the same
4,Fun book,"Fun book with lots of good recipes for every holiday--or even those special days in between the holidays. Some recipes are simple to make or with few ingredients, other are fancier. Each holiday has several different recipes so you are not limited to a specific menu. ENJOY!!"
2,only 22 minutes,The visual quality of DVD is not sharp. Cosell makes some pretty lame commentary and asks some obvious questions of Hornung. They review some clips from both the Packers and Notre Dame. Way too short and only vaguely entertaining.
5,Excellent Vendor,An excellent vendor that I would highly recommend to everyone. The vendor stood by their product and I wouldn't hesitate ordering from them again. The Paul Hornung DVD meant a great deal to me as I grew up watching the Packers with my father. I wanted to get it right and the vendor wouldn't rest until I did.
1,Sparse & elementary.,"Does not touch on meaningful corrective hair color techniques. Very little info or content here, and what is here is outdated. Rather insulting to put this before any reasonably educated person much less a student or professional. Lots of so-called ""exercises"" that take up lots of white space and yield nothing of substance relating to corrective hair color. The color wheel info and theory can be found in childerns' books. Disappointing...actually a rip-off. I've asked for a refund."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have been a professional cosmetologist for 8 years now and was looking for a book to help with corrective color as I lack some confidence when a client comes to me with color problems. When I heard of this book I thought it would have the answers I was looking for. I was very very disappointed to find this book had nothing to do with color correction. It is nothing more than the basics one learns in cosmetology school. What a waste of money. It sickens me even more that I spent a great deal of money on a thin, scrawny, half-sized book. I will sell it on ebay or to a student to try and recover some of my loss. I wouldn't even give this a 1 star rating, but there isn't a selection for zero stars."
3,Lots of facts lost in the details,"Since there are no real good histories of Russian or Soviet railroads, I had to try this book. Much of the data from this book could have been summarized into a smaller publication. Westwood understands the subject, but is unable to make it an interesting subject for the reader. Once again, and like so many books on foreign railroads, there are no maps and insufficient history of the current lines, which creates a dull prose. Westwood includes a few stories in the second half of the book which helps the pace and there are other specific notations to give the reader a general idea of the problems the railroads in Russia currently face."
1,Run away fast!,"Save your money for something that is ready for consumer use. This thing has several non-radar alert features that you cannot turn off. They go off constantly and will drive you nuts. One is supposed to be triggered by the approach of an emergency vehicle equipped with a strobe light. Nobody around here has them on the vehicles but the darn thing sounded constantly...even when I was the only car on the road for miles. While the regular radar and laser features seem to work as advertised, the false alarms from the non radar features will drive you to drink! I finally tossed this unit in the cylindrical file and bit the price bullet for a Beltronics Vector 955. Now THAT is a radar detector that does what it is supposed to do without causing me to tear out what little hair I have left!"
3,Radar detector,"The radar detector seems to work fine so far, but the voice is almost unintelligible, and is very annoying. I'm not sure if all of this model are like this of if I just got a bad one. It was pretty cheap though, so I guess it's OK."
5,A great story for all ages,"I got the CD for a friend's child (he's not a reader...yet), and want to get the picture book, too! Plus a set for our friend's little boy, since I'm keeping this CD. Nobody can tell this story like Willy Claflin, and once you get into Maynard's moosely way of talking you'll be checking out more of these great stories."
2,a good message but confusing and requires translation for little ones,"I read 4 books to my daughter every evening and this one was a library book. Although my daughter did like it (there are few books she doesn't like), it was confusing to read because of the duck and moose language (intentional grammatical errors). My daughter caught most of them as we were reading but didn't understand the humor and why the wrong words were used, so I had to try and explain that. Honestly, I don't understand the point of improper use of grammar in a book meant for pre-school/kindergarten age when the proper use of language is so important. Yes, it's cute and silly to read but it would have been just as cute without the errors.The end message is good but I would not recommend this book."
3,Some good info,I read the book in a couple of hours. Some good background info on the Algae and its uses and health benefits. Not too many specifics. Will not teach you how to cultivate your own. The book is quite old.
1,Absolutely non-scientific!,"I purchased this book as a science resource for my school library and was horrified when I began reading it. There is almost no scientific data, and many descriptions are similar to this one for the pink pearl: ""With this pearl, the animal kingdom points out to us that we have forgotten the agreement that we have made with God - to protect all living beings and especially those that are subordinate to our development."" Nearly all crystal descriptions are filled with references to God and most impart human characteristics to the crystals.Whacko! This is not a scholarly resource."
5,Very good book in the Her Story series.,"This book is about Sally Bradford, a young Confederate girl during the Civil War. This gives a Southern perspective of the war. Sally's father and brother are away fighting for the south. Even though the Brafords own no slaves the Yankees still burn her house and the family must flee to Richmond. Then, Sally's brother gets typhus and is sent to a Richmond hospital. He needs quinine but the stores have none because of the war. Sally must travel across enemy lines to get medicine for her brother before it's too late. This book showed that there was more to the Civil War then the slavery issue."
2,Not Jingle Bells,"Although the box was adorably small, the figurines were misshapen. I could have fixed that because I like doing that. Unfortunately the tune ""Jingle Bells"" didn't include the chorus!!! What's Jingle Bells without the chorus? I couldn't fix that so I returned it."
1,Dissappointed,"The music box was a dissappointment,. The song ended before its natural conclusion; it did not matter how it was wound. The quality was poor."
3,Mini Mini Sleigh Music Box,This is a nice simple gift for anybody. I did hope the box would be a little sturdier. The hinges are loose. The box looks delicate and shouldn't be handled too much. I was hoping for a little more quality to this even though its price was low. I gave it as a gift and she loves it. It's great for occassional use and it probably won't be the last musical box or gift I buy from this mftr.
4,Tear Jerker,"I was in tears at many times throughout the movie because it made me remember how important my female friends are to me. It also made me laugh. My boyfriend watched it with me and it made him wish that he could be a fly on the wall in a room full of women.Yes, it is a B or even a C movie, but I rented it long ago and will be buying it tonight. It is more of a comfort type of a movie for people who can, in a strange way, relate to what goes on."
5,Great movie! Real women and real interaction.,"This movie is touching in a way that no other I have seen has achieved. It is my all-time favourite simply for its wonderful portrayal of how women, and indeed humans, really interact. I *believe* it was improv in some way (can't remember exactly how) and it shows. The setting reminds one of On Golden Pond ... very green shots, feels refreshing."
3,Chantilly Lace VHS,"The video tape arrived promptly but the quality is not too good. I love this movie soooooooooo much and I could not find it anywhere else so I truly appreciate the video, no matter what the condition!"
4,Why can't we have it all?,"I love this movie, it shows all sides of women, what we should do, what we are told/taught to do, what others think we should do....and then there are the what we do, good or bad, what WE decided even if terrified to say it...how many times have i been there. And the good cry at the end...justified!"
1,Awful!,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just a bunch of basket cases who get together at a cabin retreat, in Utah I believe, and cry. And scream. And cry. And laugh. And cry. And eat. And cry. And destroy video cassettes. And cry. And pile on top of each other, crying (of course), with a declaration to the Martha Plimpton character (the ""outsider"" in the bunch) that ""You're one of us now!"" Awful."
4,Shore and Cronenberg with another winner!,"Shore has been collaborating with sci-fi and horror master David Cronenberg since the 1970s, and this score is yet another wonderful result. Like many of Shore's dark and brooding scores (THE GAME comes to mind) this isn't a CD from which you can pick favorite tracks -- there is really only one track that had to be divided into multiple parts. Most of the tracks sound similar and cannot be differentiated easily -- but in Shore's case this isn't criticism but praise. The score is like a book: you can't skip to one part and read it on its own and expect full gratification. The only way to listen to this CD is to pop into your player, press play, and let it unwind and permeated the room. A wonderful exericise in gloomy, doom-ridden atmospherics. Check out the movie, too -- the best thing Cronenberg has done since DEAD RINGERS."
1,unsatisfied customer,"I didnt care for this issue, I was unaware that the issue was in black/white. It didnt state that in the description."
4,Very Gorey and Corny,A friend of mine said I must see this for a funny/corny horror movie. The acting isn't good but it's definitely interesting and has it's moments. Do not buy this if your looking for a serious horror movie.
3,more of a haha rather then AWWWWWWWWW!,"this movie was pretty funny, i watched it like 5 times, and it gets funnier every time you watch it...if you wanna find out how to get into drugs..watch this...the plot, a guy get some drug in him and hes gets all strong and stuff....its nothing great....."
2,jackhammer disaster!,i thought that this movie was just a poor excuse to use blood and violence. i also thought that the acting was atrocious. i hope no sequel is made for this movie because it would not even bring in ten dollars!
1,CRACK MASSACRE!,From start to finish this movie was atrocious and completely stupid. Everything was terrible in this movie. This film would be recommended for junkies or druggies.
1,Don't watch it,"Oh, lord. This is the worst film I have ever seen. It has no acting, and is not believeable. A buisiness man named Jack Magnus goes to buy some drugs with buddy Mike. Mike gets all screwed up and dies. Jack goes crazy, gets kicked out of his apartment and moves into a (warehouse?). He then kills anybody who goes in. Although it has a plot, parts of it are thin. Such as when his sister comes to pick him up. Here is an example of the terrible acting: Jack comes towards a guy with the jackhammer and the guy simply throws his hands up and says ""ahhh!"". It looked like when someone is watching a movie on a children's show and they make the acting of the movie bad on purpose. The ending is incredibly stupid. Just don't watch this film."
1,I wish I could give 0 stars....,"This was the biggest piece of crap that I've ever seen. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't even waste time thinking about it. I can't put into words how utterly terrible this movie was. Watching 30 minutes of it felt like 30 hours--that's how long and boring it is. A group of drunken chimpanzees could act better than the actors in this movie. Yes, it's really that bad. Having teeth pulled is more fun than watching this, and that's no exaggeration."
4,Gacy...one sick twisted clown!,"Terry Sullivan did an excellent job on the book, this book was chilling and captivating. Gacy was a horrible sexual sadist that sexually tortured many young men and boys.The book had some boring parts thanks to Gacy's always trying to toy with the cops, but once you got past them it would get interesting again.Hearing the boys testify on the stand at the end was bone chilling, especially when you think about what they actually went through that left some speachless as they tried to speak of their horrific incidents with that cruel inhumane defendant Gacy taunting them with smirks.I do however think more pictures of the victims in the book would have made it all the more sad and while the book spoke alot about Rob Piest i think his picture should have been in the book. These were such good looking young men and sweet faced boys that were so sexually, brutally murdered, the more you show these victims the angrier you get at Gacy, the sadistic killer clown."
2,Not a good read...,I didnt like this book too much...too boring and too many different names to follow.
5,True Crime at its Best,"This book does not rely on personal, unprofessional opinions or long, drawn out stories from the childhood of John Wayne Gacy Jr. In fact, this book only spends about thirty pages of its entirety on Gacy's life story- the rest is about his crimes, trial, and post-sentencing. This is the way true crime should be, without pointless guessing as to what inner demons he struggled against and more about the gory bits.Come on... You know that's what you read these things for...Add to it the fact that it is written from the perspective from a law enforcement professional and you get a more clinical, less emotional book that actually describes the crimes in the detail that you expect.I've read lots of true crime books, and this is the best, in my humble opinion."
3,Not really sure about this one,"I'm not too sure about this one. I read a lot of books about serial killers. I want to read about the murders themselves and about the detectives finding the bodies, or what's left of them, anyway. This book gives hundreds of pages about the detectives following Gacy, going out to dinner and having a few drinks with him. If I wanted to know about that, I would go to a bar myself. Very slow reading and it's taking me forever because I'm bored. If you get this book, I hope you have a lot of patience. You're going to need it."
5,Great!,I found this book looking through a wal-mart book rack looking for something to read before i went back to basic trainning after christmas leave. i started it on the airplane and found myself awaiting the next page over and over again. this book became an obsesion to me. all i could think about was getting back at the end of night to read this book. i'm not going to explain the story because it already has been. but if your someone who is interested in serial killlers this is the best book about gacy to pick up!
4,Looks to be a great read,"I will know more when my sister reads it after Christmas.I will say though that the print is small so if you have any problems with reading small print this may be an issue.Shows alot of photos, appears to be an interesting book."
3,not as good as it could have been,"I bought this and was amazed of the lineup in this comic, but when i read it it was not as great as i thought. Its basically spiderman and punisher looking for sabretooth for 40 pages then we see the main monster on the last 6 pages and he gets beat in 2. it could have been a lot more better"
1,All a bit grim ...........,"designer genes ?????? This three way team up should have been great, a tale about biological experiments, with killer vigilante, the punisher coming face to face for the first time aganst sabertooth, a super powered mutant even more deadlier then him, with spider man thrown in for good measure (as the voice of reason). but writer terry kavanagh fails to get the story going and shallow characteristion does not help either! the art by scott mcdaniel is ok for the time but the whole story read now, seems and looks horribly dated..... with saying all that, it is good to see the three characters face off aganst each other"
5,Amazing! Simply Amazing,"Everyone should read this book. If you like horror, comedy, romance, westerns, it doesn't matter what you like because you'll LOVE this book. You'll Laugh. You'll Cry. You'll decide to join a Troma Cult. And who would blame you? After reading this book everyone else will be in the Troma Cult with you!"
5,Fills in the blanks of the book Auntie Mame,This book was a fun read. It fills in the blanks that were left from the book Auntie Mame.
3,Wonderful book marred by formatting errors,"""Around The World With Auntie Mame"" is a great book, a strong sequel to the blockbuster ""Auntie Mame"", and well worth reading, but the Kindle edition leaves much to be desired. It's great to have this book in electronic format, especially with the formerly excised Russian chapter, but the reading experience is marred by frequent formatting errors. Did no one bother to proofread the book before it went on sale? There are random spaces in words, words broken by hyphens (probably where there was a word hyphenated at the end of a line in the print version), and various misspelled words. I understand that software needs to be used to create an ebook, but can't a publisher spare a few human hours to check the file before it goes on sale? It's not exactly bargain basement pricing, so a proofread should have been included in the production. Still, having said that, I am enjoying this book!"
4,"Just fabulous, Darling!","Around the World with Auntie Mame is a superb set of stories with astonishingly timeless scoial observations. Mame takes on all the phonies, crooks, nouveaux riches and hypocrites, while staying very human and fallible herself. It is a crime that the Escapade in the Soviet Union story was suppressed when this book was first published. The story is clearly anti-communist and incredibly revealing about the corruption that lies at the heart of the Great Proletariat. It's a terible thing when hysteria leads to censorship.I was initailly wary of Dennis' anti-German slant (the book was written in the post-war years, after all), and how he seemingly buys into the famous myth that the Austrians were innocent victims, but the story of Mame and the Tyrolean Schloss shows how Dennis is no dummy. This book is a wonderful collection of hilarious tales: a catalogue of human frailties that remains fresh and true today."
2,Conflicted,"The cause for this CD is good, but the overall talent is somewhat disappointing. I hope that my payment mostly went to the charity."
4,One of the better Elvis tell all's,"Like the other reviewer said, it is Martin Torgoff who makes this book as good as it is. The stories about Elvis here are presented in a fair unjudgemental fashion, and the author (despite a few moments of artistic license) has a good grasp on Elvis the man and entertainer. The problem with the book is that the Stanley's were not as close to Elvis as they make out to be. For instance Ricky was not playing Racket Ball with Elvis the last night of Presley's life. Their stories turned very dark later on, but here they tell their stories both good and bad with a great deal of respect. Ricky and Billy basically maintained that respect over the years, but Dee and David's stories have gotten more scandalous since then. Basically this book captures the feel of Elvis' life in the 70's pretty well and feels authentic since it was finished before the 70's came to an end. Worth reading."
2,put yourself to sleep!,if you are having a hard to time falling to sleep..this book will do the trick..it is that boring..and full of boring lies! the worst Elvis book ever...
2,For beginners!,It wasn't what I waas looking for. I was hoping for a more advanced self-teaching book.
5,Sensible approach to eating in new book,"Dr. May and her colleagues will disabuse you of trendy diets that may work for the moment but don't offer solutions once you return to ""normal"" eating. The book offers a novel concept in eating in America - only eat when you're actually hungry and only eat as much as it takes to satisfy your stomach - not your brain. In the land of ""super-size me,"" this sensible approach to eating combines excellent information about nutrition and fitness with maintaining awareness about your hunger level before, during and after eating. You can end yo-yo dieting and not feel deprived with this concept."
5,Am I Hungry?,"She provides common sence practical, useable information. No special foods or costly products, no miracle pill, just what works. Easy to read."
1,Nothing new,I was really disappointed about this book.There is nothing new in it. All it does it takes it makes a big show off about basic stuff.I was hoping for helping information how to handle emotional eating disorder - but this book did not work at all for me. It feeld like a waste of money since everything in this book can be found for free in a flyer in your physicians waitingroom.
5,AM I HUNGRY - SUPER AWESOME BOOK,I have been a perpetual dieter since the age of 9. I am now 43. I have struggled with my weight - been up and down the scale and after reading this book I feel as if I have finally found the right answer!! So much great information - so EXTREMELY LOGICAL!! This book will help ANYONE who struggles with weight and eating issues.I highly recommend this for anyone who has ever been on a diet! Michelle May's words of wisdom on this most talked about topic are not to be missed!
5,no more diets,"Dr. May's book, Am I Hungry? poses a simple life changing question. It's that easy!! Eat when you are hungry and understand your own body's needs and you can be more healthful and fit ( and lose weight). I am an ex-WW flunkie; sure it worked while you are on the program- but for the rest of your life, probably not. Am I Hungry? is a simple question you can easily ask yourself for the rest of your life. You really get to re learn your body's wants/needs/priorities. This book helps you refocus on yourself- NOT the latest diet; and free yourself from the power food can have. After all , food is only a fuel for your body. That's a wonderful breakthrough!!!"
5,are you hungry?,"This book is one of those best kept secrets. I was amazed at the amount of info in this book. For anyone who has ever dieted and lost, this book is for you -- I mean it really is. I have battled weight gain for many years, and this is the first book that told me to master my hunger cravings. I am one of those people who often goes all day without eating, because as soon as I do, I cannot stop. Something kicks in and then I become a eating machine. This book stops that cycle permanently, and frees oneself of the curse."
5,This is the answer!,"If you are desperate, if you've tried everything, if your tired of the latest fad diet failing, don't wait to get involved in this program. You will understand when you read this book. Nothing has ever made so much sence to me. It can be done, we can be healthier, thinner and happier. I am so impressed by the teaching in this book and Dr. Mays whole approch. I love it. You will love it too! Go ahead, buy it now!"
3,"This is not Sonny Boy II, But A Fine Album Anyway","This is important music for blues lovers, and harmonica players, but it is NOT Sonny Boy ""Rice Miller"" aka Alec Williamson II, rather Sonny Boy I, whose real name is John Lee Williamson. It's rather amusing that the guys who apparently own the recordings don't know who their artist is."
1,Nothing New,"A repackaging of the same old ""positive descipline"" drill we've all become so familiar with. This book will be most helpful to parents that are completely clueless. Who doesn't know by now that parents need to ""provide love, affection and concern"" and that we need to help our children ""build self esteem""? Skip this one and pick up ""One-Two-Three Magic: Effective Discipline for Children 2-12"", by Thomas W. Phelan for practical solutions to typical child rearing problems- without the guilt!"
2,Depressing,"I bought this DVD because of its reviews and both my husband and I thought it was depressing. This movie was well done, but wasn't worth the trauma it inflicted."
4,Jack the Rabbit Jack in the Box,"This is a sweet twist to the traditional Jack in the Box where a clown pops out. This bunny is a cute little thing that pops out as ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" plays. The 18 month old that we got it for just loves it. Well worth it."
3,Does the trick,"This is a very cute product. I haven't given it to my 2 year old daughter yet (it's for her birthday). The one difficulty I can see already is getting the bunny back in its box. Also, after you get the bunny back in the box, you need to turn the crank a little so that it locks again. My daughter will need help with it every time she wants to see the bunny jump out again. But, maybe all jack in the box type toys are like that."
2,Aarg!,"Not another flimsy thing-in-the-box! This one is a smidgen better built than the others, but it is still junk. If someone could build a sturdy Jack-In-The-Box, they could make a killing."
3,Doesn't live up to my old one.,This shirt cracked on the letters after three washings. It didn't stand up to my old ZERO shirt.
3,weird shape,"The shirt is good quality and has held up well through many washings, but it is really an odd shape. Actually the photo is pretty accurate -- it's very square and boxy, and therefore is VERY short. And I think it's gotten shorter with repeated washings. The XL looks like a midriff top on my 6'3"" son."
5,Great Shirt?,"Product was exactly what I was looking for! Came in a timely manner, and I was very pleased with my purchase. Thanks!!"
2,Disappointed in Balance Board,"I grew up with a ""bongo board"" which is the same as the balance board. Except the ""base"" (ie the thing the board rolls on) is terrible. It comes in multiple pieces of circles you have to assemble to make it. The wood shreds when you roll on it. It also doesn't feel very stable. I wished I had spent a couple extra dollars and gotten the ""all plastic"" one or the ""pivet board"". We haven't even really used it because it makes a mess and I am scared it will break. This is one item I may have to bring back. I LOVED my bongo board growing up and it was so much fun. I thought it would be fun for my children too. Unfortunately I picked the wrong one."
2,Not Worth It!!,"This board is unstable and impossible to use. My friend made his using a large round PVC pipe and a wooden board, which is exactly what I should have done. I chose instead to go with this less expensive version, and it was not worth it. The base is not a smooth roller, instead it gets lodged into the outer pieces that are in the bottom of the board. I am going to try and take these pieces off. This is not the product I was looking for at all. I need a smooth piece of wood, bottom and top, and a simple smooth roller. This, unfortunately, is neither."
1,Be very wary,"Only when you get the board, do you realize how dangerous it can be. The web site description makes no clear mention that beginners need pads, knee guards and even a helmet, a warning which is included only with the assembly instructions. We have happily bought other Carrom products but there is no mention about the the dangers associated with this particular item. Even an experienced athletic member of the family almost fell off badly using the board. I note that many reviews for this product are almost ecstatically positive; fewer call it like me. Be very wary. For our family, It was not even a close call to ship this back asap."
1,DONT YOU EVER BUY THIS PEICE OF JUNK,Your preaty mush spending $50.00 on a peice of ply wood. I got this 4 days ago and its already broken and given me many splinters.
4,Tricky but well-made,"This is well-made and sturdy, from solid wood. It's trickier to balance on than the one I used in P.T., probably because the wheel is larger. It will take a few days, but if you keep trying, you'll eventually be able to stay balanced for 30 seconds or more. My grandkids love to try it when they come over, but they're not as good as I am--yet! Should be good for the ""core"" muscles."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"I didn't realiza when I purchased that inexpensive meant poorly made and designed. It did not run smoothly, and it chewed up the ""rollers"" (which you have to assemble). I am returning it for a refund, hoping to have no issues with that."
3,"Fun, but the wood slips","The wooden carrom board is fun, but at times the board slips on the wheel. I might suggest a different model not made of wood."
3,like but not love,"its a little bigger than i thought it was going to be, which isnt neccesarily a bad thing. im 5'7"" and when i stand on it it feels like my stance is a little wide. Solid construction. the roller is, well ugly. ive seen these types of boards with nicely crafted rollers made out of one piece of wood. This roller is 4 discs and 8 spacers that you put on a large rod and then bolt together. Overall I like the board but I am probably going to add some grip tape and possibly carve a roller out of a solid piece of wood."
4,Solid no-frills balance board...,"This is a basic balance board. It's somewhat roughly cut and very simple. However, it does everything it needs to. They're quite fun. It's hard to justify $40 to $50 for this if you are somewhat handy with woodworking tools, just make your own..."
2,Didn't Expect,"As a child I had a friend with one of these, I LOVED hers. When I saw this one, I was elated. it looked like a good flat board on a solid roller.Boy was I surprised when I got it. It has a RAIL so there is no difficulty and the roller is 4 plywood circles with 6 plywood squares as spacers. Really cheap. I didn't expect that and am very dissapointed. I would recommend shelling out the extra $50.00 and getting an INDO board.."
2,Balance Board balance problem,"Although this product shows a ""wheel"" underneath the board, what is actually there is a series of wood cut out circles and squares that you assemble alternately yourself. This construction is wobbly, and does not result in a tight wheel. The board is hard enough to balance on from side to side, without the added instability!"
2,Cheap quality,"My grandparents had a balance board at their house while I was growing up, so I wanted to get one for my children.This one is not the same at all. It is made of cheap pressed wood. The board slips on the wheel. You can only use it on carpet because it slips too much on floor. The wheel is constructed of three circles and 8 squares that you assemble with a long bolt that runs through them. You have to tighten the bolt regularly.It is still a lot of fun. It doesn't work as smoothly as the one my grandparents had. We used to be able to stay on it for hours. Because this one slips so much, we can only stay on it for a few minutes.I don't think it will break from our weight. I weigh about 150 lbs. I don't think I would trust it if I weighed more than 200 lbs.I'm glad I purchased it, but I would love to get one that was higher quality."
2,Wood looks like it came from china.,"For the price i feel the materials are very bad quality,the roller as everybody else has pointed out comes in several pieces & the wood used is very soft,i doubt it will hold up very well over continued use.I am 6'2 & 160 ilbs & i hear the board creaking under me,this does not inspire confidence in the product.Going to cost too much time money to send it back so i will use it then its fire wood,ponie up for the iriginal bongo board you are better off."
3,Decent Balance Board,"The only other one I've used is the Indo Board which goes for quite a bit more. This board is far less versatile than that one. For starters, the wood-on-wood contact from the roller to the board is very slick and out of the box, it's not a great experience. I added a couple of strips of cloth/athletic tape to the contact points (on the bottom of the board) and it has greatly improved the experience. I can't say I really like how it is on a track. The indo board is a solid cylinder, so you can do things like 90/180 degree swings. I just think that one is more fun."
1,It's no Indo Board,"This product was purchased to counter the expensive cost of the Indo boards. The big problem with the board is the roller that you have to assemble from half a dozen pieces of cutout plywood or composite wood. After bolting the pieces together and giving it a spin, I was immediately disappointed by the performance of this. Then upon inspection of the material used for the roller, I noticed immediate wear or deformation of the pressed wood substance and expect this piece to be useless within a month of use.I have used other boards to include the Indo boards for hours on end with no such problems. Most of the other makes use a solid piece of wood or molded plastic with great results.If I had it to do over I would spend the extra money and get the Indo board without hesitation."
1,Mixed Quality,"The board is of high quality but the cylinder is very poor. Instead of being a solid block of wood, is a collection of pieces that leave the action when balancing inconsistent and sloppy. Having grown up with a much higher quality balance board, I was very dissapointed."
3,Bach on Wood,"I first heard a sample of this on public radio and was intrigued. When I got the CD I discovered the sample I heard was the best track on the disc. It's OK, but I probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd heard more."
1,Just awful,"This record is a complete waste of your money. This guy can play the notes but has no clue what the music is about. I believe he was considered a ""promising young musician"", but good luck finding anything else by him. Terrible."
2,Too small for my carseat,The fabric was pretty nice and looked like it would have held up okay. It was just a little too small to fit my Britax Marathon. The first time I unzipped the zipper and before even trying to put the seat in it the zipper broke.
2,Only Lasted a Couple of Trips,"After only 3 trips, I need to replace this bag. First trip was with a Britax Roundabout Convertible carseat, and that fit just fine. Then we got a Britax Frontier 85 Highback Booster, and it just barely fit in. Now trying to put that carseat in the bag for 2 flights, it is ripping where the straps are sewn to the bag itself. The quality is terrible and the design is super bulky. I now need to replace this bag, and will probably either buy a Britax bag or one that has wheels."
1,A disappointment,"This is the kind of book I usually love, where a writer brings you into intimate contact with another human culture, and at the same time acquaints you with the behavior of a fascinating animal.However, like other reviewers here, I found the prose clunky, shallow, and rather egotistical and condescending. Maybe that's due to the youth of the author.There are occasional bright spots, where Hall weaves in information about Asian elephants, and historical and cultural information about the Assam region of India."
2,Not up to expectations,I bought the vanilla bean extract but I was very disappointed to find that it has a stronger alcoholic flavour to it than the actual vanilla flavour. The extract was also not as thick as the other extracts I have used. I have not tried the vanilla bean paste of this brand and maybe that is of a better quality than the extract.
3,Ingredients - added sugar?,"We bought the 32 oz. vanilla extract. Here are the ingredients, as listed on the label: Water, Alcohol, Sugar, Vanilla Bean Extractives.As others have noted, the added sugar was a big disappointment to us as well."
5,Top quality vanilla!,"Best tasting Vanilla, very rich, full-bodied, intense Vanilla flavor!!! Love the LARGE size so I don't run out during my holiday baking!"
3,Helpful,"I just wish it came with a keyring that opens so you can still put the cards in any order you wish. It's wasy for me to lose a card, but the instructions are clear and I enjoyed the cards."
3,"Great, but wish had more variety of poses","This deck is great to take around with you, and especially to regular yoga classes where they might do some poses that you need to avoid while pregnant. Just take out a card and do one of those instead! I did notice however that they left out a lot pre-natal yoga poses that I know you can do safely and have seen on prenatal yoga DVD's. Wish that had more variety to add to the deck."
2,Tricked by the reviews,"I think you are hard-pressed to call this a yoga deck. It is more like variety of stretches. I actually have some yoga experience, but most of these poses were unfamiliar. When I started out I ended up pulling a muscle because it is hard to tell if you are doing the stretches correctly because it is not a video. I imagined that it would contain different poses or variations for the different trimesters, but really almost all of the poses can be done during all the trimesters. I got this early on in my pregnancy and, as I said, pulled a muscle with it and then quit altogether. I am actually quite regretful I purchased this because I think,had gotten an actual video, I probably would have used it regularly as I do enjoy yoga and did use yoga videos fairly consistently before pregnancy. I would say stay away from this deck."
2,Not worth it,"I got this when I was pregnant. I opened it, looked at the cards, put it away to never see again. Maybe I didn't give it enough effort, but I didn't see how this would work."
3,More helpful for yoga newbies,"I own the Yoga Deck and Yoga Deck II and love them both! For my pregnancy, I wanted to make sure I am doing safe poses, and modifying them as necessary for pregnancy.Only about half of the cards (if that many) are actually poses. I was disappointed by this- the rest of the cards are meditations and breathing techniques which are handy, but I was hoping for more pose options. Most of the poses in the cards are very simple- excellent for a beginner but I feel like they do not help an intermediate person as much, except that what's in here I assume are all safe for pregnancy. The cards do offer modification tips for different stages of pregnancy, which I appreciate! Also the mantras listed with each pose are all pregnancy related.Overall these cards are helpful and I'm glad I purchased them."
3,ok,"Good idea for prenatal exercise but drawings were somewhat difficult to follow. Also a lot of cards are off limits for 3rd trimester, which was when I bought the deck. Would get it again, but just soomer"
5,Great Learning device,My son's teacher uses these in class. My son was struggling in math so I purchased them to help him reach his goals. Great tool for helping your kids understand math.
3,Good product. just not for me,"I love Learning Wrap-Ups so I bought these for my middle school math resource classroom. These were a little too advanced for my students, however I think they are great!"
3,A few words to the wise,"Yes the Prisoner series was expertly photographed (for 1966 anyway). It had very good Shakespearean acting but that means it isn't much like real life as acting Bard-style is pretty unrealistic. It should be awfully hard for modern-day americans to identify so well with Shakespearean-acting old time Europeans. The central character/actor who plays Number 6 is a nervous type in reallife. In the book The Official Prisoner Companion it states a crewmember testifying that the lead actor indeed had a problem with intimacy on the set of The Prisoner. Raed that book, that info in it and draw your own conclusions about what that says about this man's attitudes towards women in reallife. Yes he's married to a lady but question is what does this say about his attitude towards women. Lastlyu, it is only a tv show not real life don't try hard to make perfecty sense out of it and remember tv is never quite like real life."
4,Definitely worth buying...,"It's a real pleasure to have episodes of the Prisoner available on DVD, especially since this series is rarely re-run on television. Occasionally you'll see it on a PBS station or Sci-Fi, but it's rare. The episodes were just as good as I remembered them being (hadn't seen them in over ten years)! This was truly one of the ""smartest"" shows ever to run on television. My only complaint about Set 1 is that they include as a bonus an episode called ""The Chimes of Big Ben"" which has AWFUL sound quality. I had to crank the volume on my tv up and still couldn't really make out the audio. If it wasn't for that episode, I would've given the DVD five stars instead of four. But the rest of the episodes are of good quality (both audio and video). I'd recommend buying this if you were ever a fan of the series."
4,thank you!,"i watched this series as much as i could when it was on the Sci-Fi channel. i'm glad they finally bring the series on DVD with features and bonuses the television couldn't. the Prisoner is by far one of the wierdest series i have ever seen. i'm not condemning the Prisoner's merits but complimenting the amazing approach used. it reminds of Thomas More's ""Utopia"" at first, but quickly Orwell's ""1984"" wittily is portrayed by a camera or phone call. you have to laugh at times in the subtle humor the writers utilize to provide a welcome change from today's cookie cutter entertainment."
5,The Prisoner-Sets 1 and 2,"I first saw this series on PBS as a child in the early 70's and it has influenced me to this day. The level of intelligent script writing and depth of imagination is a true benchmark in television history. The tenacity of this one man to keep his individuality against all manner of methods to squeeze his secret from him makes for one heck of a series. Patrick McGoohan was made for this role and the entourage of actors and actresses who meet him on film is exceptional. Not everyone will understand it, but I would wager most couldn't help but appreciate this level of effort. I am thrilled it's finally available on tape. I've only seen the series four times in 30 years-now I own the first few-with more on order! Hooray!"
3,Exploit good taste...,"While I have been very happy to be able to see all of ""The Prisoner"" episodes via Netflix rentals. I only own this particular set. I would like to be able to purchase the whole series. The price for the volumes is out of whack with any other television collections with the exception of maybe ""Dark Shadows"". Unfortunately, this situation will likely continue to the point of making the sets more limited, collectible, and even more expensive in the long run.Other reviews adequately speak to the quality of the show. It is one of my favorite television shows.Each volume, when bought individually, provides very little in the way of extra material to provide an excuse for the price as due to high production costs.It's a shame that the series is not more accessible due to the price."
4,Educational,This is a nice educatonal toy that teaches kids their colors and to pay attention to details. Its not a fast moving game. My five year old likes it pretty well but I think he was expecting it to be more interactive. It teaches patience.
5,Muddy unplugged; Excellent music and excellent sound quality,"I picked up this CD after hearing two of its tracks on Muddy Waters' Best 1956 - 1964. It's a wonderful acoustic blues album. You've got the king of the electric blues, his wonderful voice and slide guitar, you've got legendary songwriter/bassist Willie Dixon, AND, as if that weren't enough, a very young Buddy Guy on lead guitar (who I believe to be the best guitarist in the world). All these ingredients make for one great album. Plus there are bonus tracks to fill out the CD (missing Buddy Guy unfortunately), terrific liner notes and photos, and digital remastering. This CD really, really sounds great. I was blown away by the audio quality. It sounds as if the album were recorded last year. If you like Muddy Waters, acoustic blues, or just great music, check out Folk Singer immediately."
5,Shazam!,"What a great blues album! I just received it in the mail, and this is one of those CD's that exceeds all expectations. First, I was floored by the sound quality - hi-res with beaucoups of air and a realistic soundstage. As I continued through the disc, it became obvious that this CD belongs on a short list of the best blues albums ever made because the performances were incredible! No folk songs here - it's all acoustic blues with Willie Dixon on bass and Buddy Guy on guitar accompanying Muddy. The bonus tracks are all keepers too. This is absolutely essential blues, and music for the ages."
5,An accoustic gem from the founder of electric blues,"If you are looking for a moment of peace amidst the hustle bustle of modern life, get this CD which features the King of the Blues going back to his roots with some gorgeous accoustic guitar work and timeless songs. Muddy's playing is sparse so that every note matters. His singing is soft and mysterious. This is American music at its best. It is also a wonderful record for guitar players who wish to practice their blues scales to pre-recorded music..."
5,My Home Is In Manhattan,"... and had my parents' vinyl copy of this magnificent album sandwiched in the shelves, among many other discs, good, bad and indifferent.This was one of the good ones.I imagine this album tells me a little bit about what a late-night back-porch session with Muddy Waters was like. Dixon, James and Guy supply that rarest of commodities, silence. It's like good Italian food: only the finest ingredients, minimally processed and dished up hot. It could be subtitled ""The Triumph of Taste Over Virtuosity""."
4,Nobody does it like Muddy.....NOBODY,"I feel a little guilty rating this a ""4 star"" album....but let me explain why. It is the extra tracks & the way they are so disjointed from the first 9 that originally comprised the whole album. If they were seperate....each piece would have the full 5 stars. Continuity is an important element of any great album. That being said, simply programming songs 1-9 and listening to them on their own merit willl BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF! Incredible to hear Buddy Guy learn from the master. No wonder he became king of the blues himself! Enjoy!"
5,The truth of the blues...,"For this kind of music, only humility exists. My only contribution to this thread would be the following: please tell me out there, you listening folks to the culture of music that we love, when will this wisdom enter our places and beyond.......?Oh, by the way, who will be the fool that gives this album lower than the five star album it always deserves.....? Bless the Waters......"
3,Bought for a class,"I bought this book for a class in US history. The 60s were just before my time and I didn't understand the changes that were taking place. This book helped my a great deal. It's full of information (and sometimes hard to jump back and forth between topics) but a good resource. While it wasn't the most interesting read for my class, it wasn't bad."
4,A must for people interested in Belgium!,"I saw this movie originally on the Sundance Channel... If you're a Belgian buff or like francophone movies, you have to see this. It's the first movie that I've seen that deals with the Flemish-Walloon issue or Belgian issues in general. Very down to earth yet with an artistic touch."
1,Doesn't work under the listed operating systems,"We ordered this game for our son and installed it on a machine running the appropriate operating system. The game would freeze up, freeze up the machine, and require a reboot. It would also ask for a reinstall on a variety of occasions, for no known reason. My son was so frustrated he'd cry every time the game would stop working. We finally just threw it away. Just poor software in my opinion. Would not recommend under any circumstances."
2,an oddity,"Readers, like myself, expecting a book along the lines of ""White Mischief"" will be disappointed by ""The Montessi Scandal."" It is neither a true crime book, nor an academic study putting the scandal in the context of 1950s Italy.Rather, it is a hybrid--of history, linguistics, film theory, Marxism, Feminism, psychology--that anybody who has ever sat through a semiotics class will recognize. Karen Pinkus describes her book as a ""screenplay"" (it isn't) ""concerning primarily the intersections of cinema, paparazzo photography, tabloids, feminity, and politics.""Professor Pinkus is clearly very knowledgeable about Italian history and language: the book contains a solid description of the facts and characters of the case and any consideration of the Montesi scandal would be deficient without the secondary issues Professor Pinkus raises. But the book is an oddity outside the university.A well-researched history of the Montesi scandal is long-overdue."
4,Canadian County CD,"1. Sadly Mistaken2. Fortune Smiled On Me3. The Man I Never Knew4. Stand Your Ground5. Almost Like You Cared6. Lavender Hill7. Afraid To Drive8. She Talks9. Roll Like A Wheel10. As Far As The Story Goes11. Sometimes A Harbour12. The Parade13. I Can Forgive But I Can't Forget14.

Highlights include Fortune Smiled On Me, a duet with Russell De Carle who was the lead singer of Canadian Country band, Prairie Oyster, Stand Your Ground, a fiddle-drenched two stepper and Lavender Hill, a beautiful waltz."
3,Worthwhile.,"This is a good DVD about Stern's life. It is greatly aided by interesting comments made by a varied group of famous people, violinists and otherwise. These include Eugene Istomin, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Pinchas Zukerman, Zubin Mehta, Jack Benny, Sarah Chang, Gregory Peck, Henry Kissinger, Shimon Peres, Itzhak Perlman, Yo Yo Ma. I watched this DVD after I had seen the excellent one ""From Mao to Mozart"" which has more depth and many more great extras (this has no video extras). Otherwise I might have given it 4 stars."
5,Simplicity at its best,"Sometimes the simplest game can be the biggest hit. Behind the backdrop of Wii and DS games as well as other toys that were received for Christmas, this simple little game proved to be the biggest hit. It was for my son, who loves hockey, but sister, mom and dad all got in on the action as well. It provided hours of fun on that first day and I have no doubt it will provided years for fun down the road. This game is definitely addictive fun for the whole family."
1,Broken,"Ordered two tables. Had them as a kid they were a blast, gave to my nephew and my son, Both arrived Broken in the corner.(Cost me more to ship back then I paid for them) a little duct tape made it through Christmas Both have been set out for the trash man to pick up on the 16th of January."
4,Finding the sticks,I already have the board. I am trying to find out where to buy the sticks and puck which have been losted.
4,I think these used to have...,"more feathers. The ones I received recently have had only two long feathers. I think the old ones had three which made for a more durable or at least longer lasting toy. So, it looks like they dropped a feather and kept the price the same. I'm curious why they decided to do that? My cats still love playing with them which is why I gave it 4 stars, they just don't last as long as they used to."
5,refills to the best cat toy EVER,Good variety of colors for the best cat toy ever. Quick shipment and reasonably priced. I am very pleased with this product
1,Not full size,"Had at least three refills from the pet store....these are not the same size,they are half of the size of the ones from the pet store...they don't fly the same either..very disappointed with this purchase..Also they were not shipped in a cardboard tube as was stated..just saw a seller with with a super bird refill...that's the one that you want....these little ones are no good...."
5,Awesome fun!,"I really love Da Bird and so do my cats. It's also an ideal toy for small dogs as long as you watch them closely during play. I do find there is potential for injury from the metal closure that attaches the feather portion to the string. As long as you don't pull it away from your kitty too quickly, it should be fine. Pulling too quickly could result in injury to their teeth and claws/paws (ie ripping the claw right out of the paw!). Just use common sense and know that your cat will be gripping this and may have his claw hooked into the metal portion."
5,Stable cat toy,This is one of the stable toy for my cats. They love it. Da Bird always make them jump and run around like maniac.
3,"Pretty Good Product, but smaller than usual Da Bird Feathers","These are okay. The Guinea Feather refills are a ""smaller bird"" than the regular product. I also ordered ""Fur Fun"" with these, and my cats have gone nuts over that. I guess because it's actual animal fur."
1,Be Careful Not to Wack Your Cat's Eye!!!,"I purchased these additional feather 'birds' when I purchased the Da Bird Value Pack through Amazon.The feather end attaches to the string/cord via a small metal thing-a-ma-jimmy. Whilst playing with my cat with this toy, that metal piece wacked her in the eye. She ran and wont play with Da Bird again. (Thank heavens her eye was not damaged.)So the whole thing was a waste of money"
5,These people must have cats!,"I love this product; my cats go crazy chasing it -- they mope around in the morning until I get it out. Big cats, so I need lots of refills. Lexy got out the packaged ones and opened one of them, so I guess the sight is also tempting."
1,These are crap,"My cats and I feel that these are flimsy and worthless. I cannot find/buy the good sturdy feathers they used to like, so their favorite toy is gone. Left with this cheap trash they have no interest in. What a shame."
1,Splinters,"While my cats will play with this, the end of the stick splinters and has gotten me several times in the hand. It's garbage."
1,Quarter Machine Rings,"I concur with the other 1 star review. The ring is cheap and looks nothing like the picture. It doesn't have an antiqued finish as shown. It looks like something you'd get out of a quarter machine at a grocery store.If you want to impress your lady, look elsewhere."
2,Not overly impressed,"Just like one of the other reviews stated, the display is extremely bright. I bought one for me and one for my wife. With 2 of them in the same room we could almost read a book from the light that was put off. I had a piece of tinted vinyl (for sticking to your windshield when the sun is extremely bright) and cut pieces to put over the displays. It took 2 pieces for each display to make the room dark again. It is difficult to see the display during the day, however. Also, the volume is very difficult to adjust. There is something to be said about analog controls. The digital volume on these units is too soft on one setting and too loud on the next higher setting.Nevertheless, I am still glad I bought them. It is important to have a combined alarm clock and telephone when bedside table space is limited. The fact that the telephone is cordless is an additional benefit. Having the CD Player as part of the package was not really important to me."
1,Worst purchase EVER,"This product is really, really bad! With the phone ringer and base ringer turned off, it still continues to ring. It also has some station or other playing very quietly always even turned off, and we can't do anything about it. VERY annoying problem at night. There is no one accountable for this purchase, so we are stuck with it!"
1,not what i expected,unit requires a very high level input and there is no volume control. did not work in my application. in the trash! Not nearly enough information in the advertising to make a wise choice. Poorly done and minimally efficient product on top of that.
2,Flying The Same Mission,"A heavy, colorful and easy read of aviation art prints. Be advised that you will have to endure 18 works of the cartoony art of Stan Stokes and 3 of Mike Machat. Also repeats of the same subject matter: 2 on the Yamato shoot-down, 2 Russel Islands air fights, 2 Me-109Fs in North Africa, 2 Marianas Turkey Shoot, 4 AVG, and there are 4 repeats of the over introductory art. We are treated to some fine work by Taylor, Trudigan, and Grinnell. And we could have done with more of Cohen, Dietz, Ferris. The repeats and Stokes brings this volume down to a two."
4,From the many to the one,"Books like this are very helpful but I would recommend, in addition to Dr. Cochran's book, A PAINED LIFE, a chronic pain journey. Unlike the snapshots in Dr. Cochran's book this book describes one woman's life with chronic pain, living with it and fighting against it.A Pained Life."
3,chronic pain,"I think the doctor here is being practical the only thing doctor's have to offer for the most part is medicine and mostly everything else is temporary anyway. This doctor had the compassion to write a book about pain that the average reader could understand. It takes alot of time to write a book and I, for one, appreciate his efforts."
4,Book worth Sharing,"The other day, I came across this book in my physicians office and we started discussing it.The book in his terms was so fascinating that I bought another copy of it, started reading and was actually lost in it.Really good book, worth sharing. Talking about a women, whose life changed due to Chronic Pain and making you understand the concepts of pain, how to deal with it and some top-notch medical stuff.Really useful for students, for patients and every practicing physician out there."
1,Disappointed,"Well I am a true Vikki Carr fan. Love her voice and I think she is a truly wonderful human being. BUT, this CD is a big disappointment. Somehow it just doesn't work for her. I think it is a combination of the arrangements and orchastra, they just don't match her voice. Any of her Spanish or earlier music is outstanding and I recommend it, but sorry not this CD. However, the price is right so if you are confused, pick up a copy and judge for yourself. Its not awful but not typical Vikki quality."
1,Awful,"If you're buying this CD becasue you loved her old version of ""What Child Is This"" you will be disappointed. It's not the same version. The CD has more of a dinner party cocktail hour sound than a Christmas feel."
5,Vikki's Christmas Album is Heavenly!,"I own this Christmas album and I love it! My favorites (although I trulylove them all) are ""Oh Holy Night"", ""What Child Is This"" and ""Los Peces En El Rio"". Each song is unique as Vikki sings them as only Vikki can.So, buy this CD and sit back with a hot mug of cocoa and enjoy!"
2,Casio Orchestra,"I can't believe that a serious ""artist"" would put someting like this out. Buy one of her older Christmas CDs if you like her voice, but don't buy this one!Some of the songs have great potential, but they are lost on a Casio Keyboard back up orchestra. It could have been very nice, but it is just plain bad - unless you like keyboard backup instruments. It sounds like it was done in a small town basement recording studio."
3,vikki carr christmas album,"The main reason I bought this album was that I was given a Christmas album with different artists back in the 80's and I'm talking about an old LP, and my favorite song on the entire album is Vikki Carr's rendition of ""What Child is This"" - absolutely beautiful, so I thought an entire album on a cd would be perfect, but not at all!! I knew there would be spanish on the album and I don't speak spanish, but my big dissapointment was that her rendition of ""What Child is This"" was completely different, much faster beat and not what I expected..."
3,"Seller Met All Expectations, Vikki, Not So Much.","The CD arrived ahead of time & is in perfect condition & has good quality. I was disappointed in Vikki's arrangement of the song I ordered the CD for, ""Mary, Did You Know"". She didn't sound as great as I expected. But everything else the seller provided was 5 stars!! Betty"
1,Japanese melodies,"I ordered this CD with expectations of listening to Yo Yo Ma. Instead, I received a defective CD that only had screeching noise and no music on it. Extremely disappointed-threw it into the trash."
4,interesting,"Less interesting than the others books I have read from this author, but still lots of thought provoking images and explainations."
1,"Wow, I loved this book...until...","I realized that the author cheated on his wife, chain smoked, and his children wouldn't even speak to him later on in his life. To me, this a deal breaker when it comes to this author i have loved so much. I don't understand how he had the guts to write such books and live the life he did."
1,This is not a Christian book,"This book teaches there are many roads to God so, if you are looking at this book from the christian section of amazon I warn you ""This is not a Christian book"""
1,Boring- Teaches me little,"I found this book boring. It seems as if it is a bit of a con- trying to make mre money after the first 'episode'.This guy became a millionare by saying such things as 'life is suffering!' I could have said that! Remember, this is only his interpretation on life- and what makes his better than anyone elses? Because he is a psychiatrist? He just has more experience with suffering people. That doesn't necessarily make him more right than others or more attuned to the world.People need to find their own interpretations of things- not adopt others- unless they TRULY agree. Not just because the author 'says so'.In sum, boring, uninspiring, and doesn't really help one (or me at least) on this journey of life..."
1,skimmed through first one --,"i skimmed through the first one -- dated and in places homophobic, so no idea what this one would be like -- the guy sounds like a curmudgeon, albeit a spiritual one."
4,Peck again,"This is the third book in Peck's travels down that road. I can give you the outline for the three - #1 - Life is difficult #2 - Life is complex #3 - Life does not get easy. But, you can find tidbits if you keep reading - or not, if you decide it's not worth it! (0: I'd go for the first Road Less Traveled and let the others travel along!"
1,Okay. And I won't be on that road either,"If you're not a devout Christian, this book is a bit hard to take. That's not to say that the baby should be thrown out with the baptismal water. There is some good advice and insightful gems to be had here. The chapter on The Issue of Death and Meaning is one example.Based on a ""trusted"" source that I now don't recall, late last year I committed myself to reading The Road Less Traveled. That title was written in 1978 and while I thought that was the book I ordered on line, the one that arrived was this book, Further Along the Road less Traveled.Let's just say, I'll not be going back down the road to read the original. What I would like is to go back and recalling where the recommendation for this read came from so I could adjust the recommendation meter from ""trusted"" to ""untrustworthy."""
5,Enriched My Journey of Self-Discovery and Spiritual Growth,This book was recommended by my spiritual mentor. I found that it enriched my journey of self-discovery and spiritual grow.
4,Overlooked Album from a Great Band,"While it may not be their best work, Standing on the Edge has a number of classic Cheap Trick moments. The title track sounds great. The harmonies on ""This Time Around"" are as good as any they have ever done. The lone hit from the album, ""Tonight It's You"" has a good combo of harmony and classic pop. Definitely worth a listen. I think this may be out of print now, which is why the price is so high."
2,"Far from their best, but contains some worthy tracks","This album is Cheap Trick's really bad attempt to ape mid-80s hard rock, with ""Rock All Night"" standing out with its putrid Billy Squier imitation. As a result, the lyrics are the blandest they've ever written. The band who gave us ""Surrender"" is reduced to making sexual grunts and singing about females perched at the edge of their beds. The whole album isn't a waste, however. The minor hit single ""Tonight It's You"" uses its tempo changes to construct a enaging song and ""Little Sister"" and ""She's Got Motion"" are among their best rockers. Basically, enjoy the first five tracks and ignore the rest."
4,Merger Material,"I have a dream. That dream is for this album to be remastered and re-released but not as it was, instead merge this and The Doctor. Sure they're like chalk and cheese in styles but really, do we need to have a remastered version of She's Go Motion and It's Up To You? Who wants that?(From SotE take:)Tonight It's YouLove ComesHow About YouStanding On The EdgeThis Time AroundCover Girl(from The Doctor take:)Good Girls Go To HeavenKiss Me RedIt's Only LoveThe DoctorAnd you've got yourself a decent album. Maybe add Are You Lonely Tonight instead of The Doctor for something lighter.For the original listing though:We all know how great Tonight It's You Is. This Time Around, How About You, Standing on the Edge and Loves Comes are also winners. Cover Girl is OK filler. Wild Wild Women and Rock All Night don't have much to offer. Little Sister and She's Go Motion are two of the worst songs CT ever did.Merge baby, merge............"
3,Good Stuff,"This was a good return to form after the GOD AWFUL ""The Doctor."" The guitars come back to the forefront, for the most part, and the songwriting is much more consistent. ""Little Sister,"" ""Tonight It's You,"" ""How About You"" and the title track are all top notch. The only is dud is ""Rock All Night,"" though ""Love Comes"" takes a few listens and the keyboards are pretty irritating. This is a keeper...one of their more consistent 80s releases."
3,a good one but badly produced,"i dont know how Bun e Carlos let the producer get away with the sound of the drums on some of these songs. Little Sister, and Tonights its You are great songs but the drums are totallly lost in the mix. Aside from that complaint there are some great songs like Rock all Night which Rick said was ""our tribute to Spinal Tap"" . as usual there are some crap songs but there are a few standouts so i guess its worth it."
3,"Flashy, trashy fun -- with a couple brilliant ballads","Mixing arena-rock flamethrowers, stunningly effective ballads and a bit of their old mischief, Cheap Trick comes up with a rockin' good record. Most folks only remember the brilliant ""Tonight It's You,"" but the sweet and sincere ""Loves Come Around"" is almost as potent. Best of all are a handful of giddy rockers -- the hyperactive ""How 'Bout You,"" ""Little Sister"" and the mighty title track. After watering down their bombast to suit producer Todd Rungren on ""Next Position Please,"" Trick sounds delighted to crank up the amps once again. While ""Standing..."" is a far cry from the glory days of ""In Color"" and ""Heaven Tonight,"" the band wouldn't sound this convincing again until the great ""Cheap Trick '97."""
3,"Robin Zander's vocal on ""Tonight It's You""...","...the standout cut on this ""lost in the 80s"" Trick album, proves that he is truly one of the greatest rock vocalists of all time. I can forgive the group for not performing the track live more often because I can only imagine what it must take to wring that level of emotion out of a performance!"
5,This works,"I am a Japanese language speaker, so I was afraid this might not work for me. But the result was amazing. I had been a bad public speaker since I could remember, small voice, shy posture... But, last week, at the end of company's presentation training session, when I delivered a presentation, a miracle ocurred. The training participants remarked on each other, and I recieved such comments as ""terrific"" and ""perfect!"" ( in Japanese.) Well, I think this little personal success largely owe to listnening to this program for a week.(Update in February 2006)I made the above comment in September 2005. Now, yesterday in February 2006, I successfully delivered a speach in front of 40 people in English at a party. I am so proud of myself. If you want to achieve something, I recommend this program."
3,Giggle...,His voice an proper grammar have taken a while for me to get used to without smiling. By the second track I am often out. Whether my life is changing I will have to keep you all posted.;-)
5,The magic's in how they make you feel.,"I own several of Glenn Harrold's CDs. I've tried many other relaxation/hypnosis products over the years and Glenn Harrold's are by far-and-away the best I've heard. As many of the other reviews have pointed out, the production values on these CDs are extraordinary, but that's not what makes them special. What makes these CDs special is how good they leave you FEELING.Many of the other hypnosis recordings I've tried would either put me to sleep half of the time or just feel like a chore to listen to. Glenn Harrold's CDs actually make for a very enjoyable and pleasant listening experience. And regardless of how I felt before hand, I'm always left feeling refreshed, serene and on an ""even keel"".If you're looking to purchase just one hypnosis title, make it one of Glenn Harrold's. You will not be disappointed."
3,GREAT VOICE,"I ordered this cd based on the top notch reviews, I have yet to notice anything different after listening to this every night for 3 weeks. I am a person with much creativity so thats not a problem for me. The problem i have is putting my ideas to work. However, I don't feel the hypnosis works on me. So maybe thats why I haven't had results. His voice is beautiful and all that the cd represents is wonderful to listen to. This cd puts me to sleep!"
5,Yoga Journal's Yoga for Longevity,I agree with what Kathy had to say about this video. I'm a Yoga Instructor and really appreciate Rod's articulation in this video. I highly recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in yoga for improving their health and wellbeing.
4,poor transfer,"a really terrific movie, as everyone here's stated. I saw the film on its theatrical release in the same double feature a lot of people speak of. But on buying the DVD, I was disappointed at the dark, muddy transfer. The dance sequences are fairly well-lit, but a number of the scenes are so dark it's difficult to tell what's going on."
1,Hole lot of Confusion,"Well,Don't really know what to say about this movie!! Not what I expected at all!The best I can figure is that this is some twisted tribute, to the music of the late (?) Grace Chang.Interesting does not even begin to describe it The Camp dance sequences, seem to have no relevance to the main storyline, except to introduce an element of the ridiculuos and to send you into fits of laughter.The Storyline, well, that is even more bizarre, Guy lives in run-down apartment, plumber, who's doing the girl downstairs, knocks whole in floor, girl downstairs falls for guy upstairs!!Well, that's all I can really say. The movie has it's value, I don't think I have laughed at a movie so hard for ages, not because it was funny, but because it was SO TACKY!!maybe If I understood chinese I might have liked it more, but just not my style!!"
5,"MoJo's Dynamite ""Dynaman"" Theme Songs, and Karaoke Too!","Limited to a pressing of 5,000, this 12cm CD single was released in Japan in 2006 to help celebrate the 30th anniversary of Super Sentai series. If you've been searching for the full-length opening and ending themes of 1983-84 sentai series ""Kagaku Sentai Dynaman,"" this is exactly what you need! It features four tracks, all digitally remastered:1. Kagaku Sentai Dynaman (MoJo/Koorogi '73)2. Yume o Kanaete Dynaman (MoJo/Koorogi '73)3. Kagaku Sentai Dynaman (karaoke)4. Yume o Kanaete Dynaman (karaoke)The energy of the mighty MoJo is complemented perfectly here by the members of Koorogi '73, keeping these songs evergreen! It can also be fun to take a whack at the songs yourself on the karaoke tracks (printed lyrics are included, in Japanese). Highly recommended for hero song fans!"
5,A Competent Effort.,"Sadly, there isnt a lot of documentation for the early years of FSU or Seminary West of the Suwannee. Two of my ancestors were professors at the Seminary, and Dr.Murphree was a relative as well. The book contains an assortment of photos, especially one of the old Seminary building. The book is worth the current price."
2,For those who will spend more than 5 months studying GRE:,"If you will study through Princeton review and Barron, this is a redundant purchase. The Crash Course is too brief and I doubt if testers will learn much from it."
4,Good Merchant to do Business With:,"I had an issue with the product, but the seller quickly answered my email, and was willing to do what they could to resolve the problem. They were very courteous and prompt. I will certainly continue to do business with this online merchant.It is a good way to pay less for HP cartridges, when you do alot of copying in color. You certainly pay alot less when you have the cartridges refilled, rather that buying brand new. Either way they don't last long, and you have to replace them anyway, so why not save money?"
3,Cheap,"Pros: it's cheap.Cons: it's cheap.We bought this because it was cheaper, and we don't really plan on keeping this printer much longer, but it refused to print black pages while it had no yellow ink (go figure.)This was our first time buying non-HP ink. It works, but:as another reviewer noted, it does smell a little when still wet;Takes longer to dry than official HP ink.When printing on photo paper, it prints in 'dots' (think it's how it dries.) While not terrible, it's not great, and certainly no where near the HP ink we usu buy quality. (Yes, I've tried cleaning the cartridges.)Color looks nominal on regular paper, but, as I said, takes a while to dry, and so often causes the paper to 'warp' a little around pictures.I'd give it fewer stars, but at this price point, if you just want your printer to work, it does that. Not sure on quantity of ink, yet; have only printed ~5 pages."
2,not happy,I was disappointed with this product. The color was not all that great. I have purchased refurbished ink cartridges before on here and was happy with them but can't remember who I ordered it from. Don't believe I will order any more from these people.
4,Good belt for the price,"[30+ days usage] No major complaints. The belt is a lot stiffer than the image makes it seem. It is by no means a soft leather, so there is a bit of a breaking in period, if you expected it to be as pliable as the image makes it look (it's only now getting flexible). There was also a very strong (leather and something else - almost like a glue), but that's since faded. It's comfortable and wears well, so otherwise happy with it."
5,Perfect Amount of Distress,I bought this for my BF but I love it so much I am going to start using it too. It has the perfect amount of distress and the leather is good enough quality for the price.
4,Good!,"I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend with a Nintendo belt buckle and he said it's nice! So far, no bad things about it. I don't know if it will last very long but I am satisfied right now. Will update if it starts deteriorating quickly or if it lasts long. :)"
5,This buy is a very safe bet.,"I never purchase clothing articles online, so I was very uncertain what to expect with this belt. I am very picky with the way items fit me and I am always looking out for shady workmanship, so size and quality were uncertain factors that nearly kept me from making this purchase. However, once I removed the belt from its package and tried it on, I was immediately satisfied with its perfect fitting and apparent high quality. I have a history of belts falling apart on me no matter how much I pay for them, so the low price this one was offered at had me highly suspect its practicality for everyday use. If that is your concern, then rest assured that this belt is not cheap by that standard. After quite a while of regular use, mine is not showing any signs of strain or obvious wear after constant use. I will update my review if that changes."
3,A decent belt,"""A decent belt. It's obviously a cheap belt, in quality and in price. It's a bit darker than indicated, mostly black, with some worn areas that are a lighter tone. The inside of the belt is dyed blue and grabs and makes it difficult to slip on and off. The belt feels sturdy, and looks pretty good. """
3,Vintage Look Distressed Black Leather Strap Belt,Pretty good belt. Good quality leather. Unfortunately one of the three automatic buttons did not work properly so I had to have it fixed by a cobbler.
5,Awesome!,"Loved the belt! Got it with the Imperial logo belt buckle and it fits wonderfully. Has a nice ""old"" look to it without sacrificing quality. Would recommend to others."
5,5 stars!,It's a great little distressed belt snap! Looks as if from an old cowboy movie or as if it came from Wolverine himself worn for decades but it is sturdy and looks cool.
2,wrong belt,I ordered this belt thinking it would look cool with some distressed jeans but upon receiving it it was all black with just the edges worn still looks nice just not the nice I was looking for
4,"Hè hè its oke but don,t over do","Its very good ,positife, and very good writing .But dont over do , i think all THE feedback is from THE christ people .But IF your just human i think its good raid and very transforming ."
1,New Age or Christian???,"Definitely new age theology in this book. I don't know how the author could mix new age theology and Christianity together - they are so different. The Bible says there is one God who created 'human' beings, not little demi-gods. New Age theology says ""you are Gods"". Christianity and new age can never agree because they are diametrically opposed, anyone who says otherwise obviously does not know the Bible."
5,"Durable, high quality game that's a lot of fun to play!!!","A great scaled down version of a classic. I used to play on a 14' table growing up, and this little (relatively speaking, it's nearly 4' long) Carrom model is just as fun. The pucks roll freely with just a bit of friction which allows for pinpoint accuracy.I also looked at the Crosley model, but it didn't have the triangle scoring game in addition to the parallel 1-2-3 scoring layout, so I went with the Carrom. I'm glad I went with the Carrom. Very sturdy and well made.When the mercury plummets to 30-below up here in sunny Minnesota, my boys (7 & 4) and I haul out the shuff and have a great time!If you think $35 - $40 is a bunch of dough to spend on a wooden board game, keep in mind that this is a game that could conceivably outlive YOU!Buy it. Stop reading this gibberish and buy it. You'll love it.Dan B. - Taylors Falls, MN"
5,Excellent customer service,"I am very pleased with my recent purchase. There was a defect in the original shipment and Amazon was so quick to send me a replacement in time for the holidays. I had contacted the manufacturer several times before contacting Amazon. I never heard from the manufacturer. Sadly I will not buy any more of their products, but I will be back to shop on Amazon. What a great website!!!!"
4,Good Game,Nothing to much to say besides its pretty small which is good for people with not much space. Some of the sliders get stuck a little bit but its nothing that ruins the game.
4,Good game,This game was really nice. It was larger than it looked in the picture. There are only a few playing pieces though so don't lose them.
4,It's was a hit!,"I bought this item as a game for the kids to play when they came to my house for Christmas Eve. I always try to have something new for them to do. They really enjoyed playing this. It was small enough to fit on the coffee table yet long enough to challenge them. They thought it would be simple to score becuase of it's size, but the size fooled them. It wasn't long before they were laughing at each other and moaning when they missed the targets. It was a hit. I'm glad I made the purchase. It was well worth the cost, which I found very affordable. Oh, and it was delivered within a couple of days of my order. At Christmas time, no less!!I'll bring it out again this summer for picnics."
4,Mini Shuffleboard,Great portable board for family fun. Pucks are a bit sensitive. Had to replace first board delivered due to board irregularity and two defective pucks but Amazon and Carrom replaced them with no hassle and the second set was perfect. Highly recommend.
2,Pucks have rusted already since Christmas 3 days ago,"Was so thrilled when we first played this - my sister had wanted it for so long. But then we just went to play it today, 3 days after Christmas and two of the pucks are already rusted which makes play impossible. I would like to contact the seller but do not see an option to do so. Would change the rating to 5 stars if these pucks are replaced."
1,Horrible pucks!!,"I was really excited when I found this. A friend of mine had bought one at a garage sale about 20 years ago. We had a lot of fun playing on that shuffleboard! When I finally received the item, it was delivered without any damage. The shuffleboard itself looks great, but as soon as I started rolling the pucks, I was very upset. These pucks couldn't pass a sobriety test! The pucks that I used to play with, were much better quality. You could really play with finesse with them. Fast or slow, they always rolled straight offering good competitive game play. The current pucks roll so poorly, resulting in the board sitting in my closet wasting space. Not only that, I missed the return date, and now I'm stuck with firewood. That's my fault. Anyway, I want to give two stars because of how nice the board is, but what's the point if you can't use it."
3,Low - budget gorefest,"That is what you get.Poor story,acting,weird camera tricks,used in wrong time and wrong place,but enough gory to satisfy the gorehounds.But I admire lifestyle of Todd Sheets:he work in haunted house,listen metal music,he is a horror fan and make his own gory movies.If for nothing else,than for this ,I want to see his other movies"
2,"very cheap,very violent,amateurish production shot on video","This movie seems like it was filmed in one weekend with the help of the director's friends and family,and a low end camcorder.The violence is gratuitous and is utilized not to advance the story but to simply shock the viewer.The story itself is derivitive,contrived,and overall incoherent.The characters never develop beyond an half dimension and you can care less what happens to them.I realize what the director was going for,he was trying to imitate redneck zombies but he failed miserably because troma cornered the market on ultra violent,shocking,exploitation movies and it's hard to say but they do it with more class and with a serious sense of humor."
5,ZOMBIE BLOODBATH 2 RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hey, if you like gory horror movies, this movie is for you! Directed by Todd Sheets, Zombie Bloodbath 2 surpasses it's original. It's action packed and extremely gory! Note for young BABIES!!! Todd is the BEST!!!!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just recieved this little piece of crap. They're really nothing like the picture, they are very small and cheap. I should have gotten sunnies. These should sell AND ship for $2.00 at the most, DO NOT BUY!!!!! This is a fair warning."
3,ok,while I like being able to see this set didn't seem to fit my small face as well but other than that they do the job
5,super tan,"great product, great price, fits perfectly, covers what needs to be and leaves the rest bare ;-)"
2,Will not return e-mail,"Same problem as other customers. The vender will not respond to e-mails. I tried to cancel the order, before it was shipped, but the vender shipped the item despite my request. And, the item was shipped 4 days after my request, not to ship and cancel the order. I got my product with-in the time table, but the vendor should respond to e-mails when sent. The vender has no concern for the customer."
5,Looking forward to the release of season one,"Every year come mid January, I get, for lack of a better phrase ""seasonally disaffected"". By this time half of the school year is over. As I struggle with being a good parent to get the child off to school a 7:15 in the morning when I couldn't get to sleep until 3am, I have learned to absolutely loathe Mondays.Then came Being Human. It's funny and dark and a wonderful way to chase the winter blues away. With its brooding and I might add gorgeous vampire, cute quirky ghost and neurotic yet endearing werewolf I now look forward to the start of the school week.Give it a go. Everyone enjoys an escape from their own personal reality."
3,Audio Problems,"I don't know if anyone else is having this issue, but I'm having problems with the audio. For some reason I can hear the music in the background but I can't hear the dialogue. Is anyone else having this issue?"
4,UK Version FAR outstrips American,I tried to start watching the American version of Being Human and just couldn't embrace it. A friend suggested I try again with the original UK version. One of the BEST hints I've had in a long time. An intriguing story backed by solid acting skills and wonderful effects.
4,Oddly entertaining,"I must admit, my expectations were quite low considering the premise. I mean really, how could a show about a werewolf, vampire, and ghost as roommates really go?Oddly enough, it works very well. And ""hats off"" to the casting director. This is certainly a show where the actors really do make it work. Watching the characters deal with real-life situations (girlfriends, landlords, etc.) compounded with their afflictions, makes for an interesting story.There is usually a great balance between the drama, and the comedy, and that is what makes the characters ""real""."
3,its a,"It better than the U.S version. The first season starts off a bit slow... The concept is unique enough to keep you watching until the plot thickens, and thicken it does!"
2,"bad, but addictive","Ever seen a B-Movie that is terrible, but you just have to see the end. This show is the same way.Aidan is the worst Vampire I've ever seen. Josh is a complete wuss. Sally is the only appealing character. Her feelings are raw and endearing, and she is completely beautiful.The entire series is about how their supernatural lives are completely not-human, but they want to be human.This series is B-Movie grade story, acting, and special affects. It sucks, but I can't stop watching."
3,not as good as new shows,I really enjoy the show onMonday 's .I don 't care for this as much at all.Not what I thought it was.
5,Great British Show,"I started watching this show, and now I am hooked. I'm looking forward to the next couple of seasons of Being Human (UK version)."
2,ba,"Not even sure why someone felt compelled to remake the show running on the BBC. What a waste of time, energy and money."
1,UK Version much better.,"The original UK Being Human is much better than this American version. I have been a fan of Being Human since it's debut on BBC America, but this remake is terrible."
3,Got bored!!,"Like it at the beginning, and then I just got bore of there constant whining and lack of vampire authority from the Vampire character. I like it, but his hair is always life full of gel and like it sweat alone, I don't know, but I started to see the American version and I finally see what I was looking for in a vampire. I like their version better, yes he is trouble but he is not a wimp."
1,Beware!,"While this is technically a region-free release, it is at 50 Hz and therefore not playable on U.S. Blu-ray players. Best to wait for the U.S. release this summer."
4,Brittish version is better than the American version,"I really enjoyed this show. I was not so thrilled with the American version (different actors). It is by no means Spilberg quality, but it is a very interesting story line with actors that you want to like."
5,Great series!,"BBC has been doing some fantastic series lately, and this is another one of them. A vampire (Mitchell) and a werewolf (George) want to break out of their molds. They want to try leading 'normal' lives, so they become roommates. Of course the place they rent comes complete with a ghost (Annie). The three become friends and start exploring what it really means to be human. The story lines have been wonderful, and the acting is surprisingly good for a tv series. This is currently being redone for American audiences on the SciFi channel (I refuse to accept their change to ""SyFy."" That was a ridiculous move on their part.). The American series is also turning out pretty good, but I have to admit I still like the British version better.In an aside, everyone goes on and on about Mitchell...I have to disagree, though. I'm definitely a George fan."
5,being human,5* Yes. I watched all of the season's. I have only good reviews. The case played there parts really good. And I do pay attention to those things. The werewolf was so good he cried often in his parts. All the characters was extremely good. I watched show after show. The Girl the was the spirit she was the reason. You will love them all.
4,Where's the first episode?,I bought this season and was rather disappointed to find that it is missing the pilot episode which was aired the year before the series was. I was unable to find any way to purchase the pilot episode and ended up viewing it on some Russian(?) video site. The series makes a WHOLE lot more sense if you watch the pilot first!
3,"So-So, but willing to give it a chance","This version of ""Being Human"" has yet earned my total praise. The BBC version absolutely captured me from the very first moment and the British actors were instantly people that you could care for from the moment you were introduced to them. The premise for either show is an appealing and fascinating concept so I am willing to wait and see if the US version hits its stride soon but it needs to happen ASAP or I will lose interest completely. Hoping it does :)Heather"
1,Don't waste your time & $ - watch the U.K. version...,"The U.K. version is fantastic! The actors in the U.S. version are pretty uniformly wooden, the characters are on a pretty uniformly self-righteous and indignant rant. No chemistry, no sense of humor about themselves - the opposite of the U.K. version. Boring! I'm only sorry I spent the price for the whole U.S. version, season 1. I won't bother wasting my time watching the whole thing. Definitely go for the original U.K. version, seasons 1-3."
2,British,I just don't get a lot of the references. I usually like British humor but this just rubbed me the wrong way. I'd like to see the American one on prime.
5,Bitten by Being Human,I find this much better than the US remake. A very exciting and sometimes disturbing but thought provoking. One of the better vamp/werewolf stories out there.
4,Good!,"Enjoyable and fun to watch. Great characters and development. Why is this thing making me write so much, I really don't care"
4,good show but not as good as BBC one,good and loved watching it but the overall acting and way story played out better in BBC series. i would recommend it to watch.
2,original is better,This show is a remake of an uk show. What happens to remakes they end up being worse than the original. I suggest you check out uk version.
2,By All Means Skip This Product and Buy the SanDisk Sansa,"I owned this exact product for 7 months before it died unexpectedly. It replaced a Rio that I owned for 6 years and used for 30-60 minutes every day running or lifting weights. The Lyra's battery consumption was horrible compared to the Rio, and even worse to my new 1 Gb Sansa. I'm still on my first battery with the Sansa, and it has played what would have been 3 batteries worth of MP-3's on the Lyra.The user interface and features on the Lyra don't compared to either the 2000 Rio or the 2006 Sansa. Sadly, Rio exited the business, but the SanDisk product is at least as good. Plus, for the same price I paid 7 months ago for the 512 Mb Lyra, I got a 1 Gb Sansa.It is sad to see the vaunted RCA name on such an inferior, poorly designed, and undependable product."
2,Great if it works,"I got two of these for my two sons since I had good experience with an earlier RCA MP3 player - the 1080 series.Unfortunately, one stopped working after a month and without a receipt or anything I gave up on it. The other is fine. So 5 stars if it works - 0 stars if it dies.No squeal and nice sound.It seems to have a limit of 1 GB additional memory. I tried it wiht a 4GB SD card and it doesn't see more than 1 GB - might be a driver limit."
1,"Sounds great, except for the faint squeal in the background",Maybe you won't notice. I didn't at first. There is a faint squeal in the background. I double-checked; it's not in the music files (they sounded fine in a Creative player). I mostly listen to classical music and the squeal really stands out during the quiet parts. Took it back the next day.
5,I had two and they lasted forever.,"I got one for my 13th birthday and one for my 14th birthday,which was YEARS ago.I have had them for 5 years and they still work fine,the cover over the buttons on the side came off of one,but it still works.One got water spilled on it,it still works.I recently lent them to my brother to use while he was working in a factory.And he lost them both.I miss them so much.They are such strong little players.They are amazing."
2,Not the best player,"I used one of these for close to a year before I upgraded. While I found the audio quality to be just fine, I did experience that it ate batteries like nobody's business. I also had some issues with it staying connected to my PC long enough to transfer more than 1 or 2 songs at a time, so I eventually gave up on that and went with just using SD cards. Eventually this player had problems playing in both ears, a problem related to the fact that the headphone jack is only secured in the player with the solder points and eventually the natural stress created by the headphone plug will cause the solder joints to fail, resulting in loss of signal to one ear or other. This is a common issue for lower-priced MP3 players. While I certainly feel like I got my money's worth from the product, I won't buy another."
5,RCA Lyra RD1076 personal player,Very happy with the product so far and it looks like a new MP3 player. I am pleased with your service.
5,"Herman Miller, a brand known for comfort","I purchased my Herman Miller basic after having used them at work exclusively for the past 6 years.While i've got the lumbar model that's a step above this one at work, this model suits me well for home.I suffered from lower spinal damage (L3- L5), sitting in a chair for long periods can be quite un-comfortable, thisisn't the case with my Aeron.People often tend to skimp on a their office chairs, often keeping them for years. Most of these chairs aren't ratedfor that kind of use and abuse, that's why you get what you pay for. The Aeron is a solidly built, long lasting chair."
5,Hot Button Book,As I write there is a storm swirling around the hiding place cluster of books. Guardians of the legacy are digging in their heels preventing an historical evaluation of the entire project.
3,"Comprehensive, but a little outdated","Norman Moss's book makes a good attempt at comparing British and American English. I think some of the words and expressions are a litte dated, but on the whole he's made a fair attempt at this difficult task. Where he slips up is when a word such as firefly is known in both countries. He indicates that lightning bug is American, and firefly is British; however firefly is also well known in America. It would be nice to see a table comparing words which have very different meanings in the other country. e.g. cordial, homely and loft. I recently purchased ""Divided by a Common Language"" which has more accuracy and includes pronunciation and spelling differences."
4,Fun computer program,"This was a great computer program, when we purchased it. My son loved Thomas and playing all the games!!! Great computer game/program!"
3,Fairly routine,"Basically, a history of colonial South Carolina. Its existence and survival centered around the Indian trade, which because of geography allowed traders to penetrate deeper into the interior than in any other colony. But the French to the west and the Spanish to the south caused trouble for the English. The Yamasee War (1715-16), in which the Indians rose up against the settlers because of unscrupulous traders, was an important event, and one which caused the Indians to asscocite themselves even more with the French. Unfortunately, Cranes book is not a very stylish one, and certainly some maps would have helped."
5,a great bartender's guide,"Liked this so much I got one for myself and one for my daughter, an aspiring bartender. The Regans are truly experts and writers, a rare combination. Buy a copy and enjoy the presentation as well as the recipes."
4,Very good!,"Got this book and was immediately impressed by the loads of recipes. However, there are some good ones missing and some of the recipes are tinkered with a bit (as most are), but that's just nitpicking. Overall an outstanding recipe book! Well worth the price!"
5,"Nice, easy to use little book.","I have owned one of these books for a few years and my friends and I used to take it with us to our favorite bar and try all the different drinks. We had so much fun and the book was so convenient that I bought a second one as a gift for our favorite bartender so we didn't have to take mine all the time. It doesn't have every drink in it but I really like the way it's made and how easy it is to use. It has little stories about some of the drinks and some virgin drink recipes too, though that's not a reason to buy a mixology book, it's a nice touch and I'm sure it could be useful if you were throwing a party where not everyone would be drinking. I would highly recommend this book for anyone wanting an easy to use, inexpensive (especially for what I paid here on Amazon) little bartending guide-cheers!"
3,Lathor,Saw these two gentlemen in concert recently in San Diego. This CD pretty much follows the concert program but was better executed than the live performance.The baroque pieces are best. Terrific entertainment in the car or at home.
4,Killings at Outpost Zeta [VHS],A team of scientists sent to investigate the disappearance of several space missions discovers an alien life form of volcanic rock monsters roaming the planet called Outpost Zeta. I think you need to watch it more than once to get all the little things in here.
4,A great learning tool,"Out of all the many books I have used to learn Japanese, I can honestly say that this series of books has helped the most. It is hard to explain exactly why but I guess it is because the Author is a great teacher who knows how to put his method down on paper and into book form."
3,Japanese 1,Am using this in a Japanese beginner language course with a Chinese instructor; so far it seems to be a useful book. The Hiragana chart has been the primary focus so far - it's in the back of the book. She wants us to learn the Hiragana characters and avoid Romanji as much as possible.RS in Rhode Island
4,My cats watch it,"My older crabby female cat enjoys watching it very much. My three year old boy cat is almost to skitish for it though. The opening segment is gerbils and he really likes to watch them. The problem is, after the first set of gerbils there is a few sequences of birds. It might just be the big screen, but when the parrot comes on he runs and hides. (Its actually pretty funny!)"
4,Good DVD,"My cat loved the DVD for a while, and then inexplicably had to go wash her feet. That is not the fault of the DVD, that is just a cat being a cat! It is a good DVD and worth it to watch the cat watching TV, for however long they stay interested!"
4,Great idea for indoor cats!,"I have only played this DVD once, and only one of my three cats was interested, but he was FASCINATED with the show. Gerbils, mice, birds, fish, butterflies, squirrels - he didn't care for all of them, and the audio seemed repetitive to me, but he didn't seem to mind.It was as much entertainment for me as it appeared to be for him! (I wish I could post a picture of him here; needeless to say, I took several!)"
2,so-so dvd,"We recently rescued a feral cat. Obviously he has social issues and would rather be outside than in our home...but....in our home is where he is. I got this thinking it might help him transition. Well, he is a pretty smart kitty. The first time he watched it he was entranced, the second time he tried to get the mice, the third time he was bored and knew he couldn't get to the creatures. Since then he has ignored the DVD totally. The quality is only fair with quite a bit of camera jumping around and the outdoor sounds are annoying after a while....at least annoying to me."
5,Cat is hooked!,I have one inside cat. She is obsessed with this video. It actually has turned her into a t.v. watcher. I think she's always waiting for the birds and mice to come out regardless of what we are watching.I Highly recommend this product.
5,Cat loves it!,It is truly entertaining to watch my cat while she is watching this DVD. If your cat seems to watch TV when animals are on it..this is a great investment.
3,Think twice before buying,"This is an average video to keep cats entertained, not as engaging as I had hoped. My cat seemed more interested in the Cat music video than the rest of it. Overall, I'd say that it keeps him engaged/entertained when he's in the mood to watch it. He prefers us to watch it with him-I was hoping for something that would keep him interested when I'm not home/busy."
3,I was the only one watching,I couldnt get any of my cat's to even look at it. The videos were nicely done and the sound was also appropriate. I thought the cats should have been interested but they weren't. I tried sitting them right in front of the screen but they never noticed the gerbils or birds. The lower rating is only because it did not work for my group of cats. The quality of the video was excellent.
5,Cat's really love it!,My cats sat and watched this for 45 minutes straight. Incredible! We put it on the next day and they still loved it!
4,So glad I bought this dvd,"I have a cat that has a high prey drive. I'd been eyeing this dvd for a while after seeing it highlighted on moderncat.com and when it went on sale I grabbed two, one for me and one for a family member, it even arrived extra fast and arrived in time for Christmas. I'm very pleased I got it.I LOVE that is has a ""loop"" feature so I can turn it on while I'm gone to work or out shopping. My cat now comes running when I turn on the dvd player (seriously) She is glued to the tv for all of the segments with the small birds and mice, , even climbing on the tv to try and get to the birds.She could care less about the segments with the fish, parrots and squirrels.pros: The loop feature. great segments of tiny birds keep my cat interestedcons: The fish segments are unnecessary, especially with the bird chirping soundtrack. The music video of cats playing is also pointless and unnecessary.Overall I highly recommend this dvd if your cat is prey driven."
3,Cat TV,My cats are sort of interested in this DVD. I only use it when I am going to be out of the house for long periods of time.
2,Just not their thing,"This video was just not my cat's thing. Since they do tend to watch TV, I thought they would really love it but I think the videos of the animals are too close up and not ""nature-y"" enough. It's not like looking through a window. Not a total flop but they watched it for about 2 minutes and were done."
1,Paws down,"Purchased this and another Cat sitterIII DVD and the cats said not interested, not their cup of catnip. The dog didn't care for it either. What can I say...my household gives it a Paw's down."
2,Not What I Expected,"I thought this would be at least 15-30 minutes of scenes and sounds that would interest my cats. It turns out it's only 3-4 scenes (at least one that just shows cats watching the DVD). It has butterflies and birds, but it didn't interest either of my cats for a second. I was disappointed, too, because it plays in an endless loop. I had hoped it would be something I could enjoy with my cats, but it's just annoying to me. I've never bought one of these DVDs for cats, so maybe they're all made similarly. But I feel like I wasted my money.Disclaimer: My cats can watch birds, butterflies, and lizards through the patio door and the bedroom window, so maybe that's why this didn't interest them."
5,Fun for all!,"I have a multi-cat household, so needless to say, I need ways to entertain them that don't always include me. This is a wonderful way to make them happy, and at the same time, give me a break. I had this in VHS, and I knew I has to get the DVD since they love it so."
5,My cats hid the remote...,"My cats are obsessed with this dvd. It is actually very relaxing to have on while doing things around the house, too. The only problem is, one cat tries to tear the frame off the television to get to the various critters on the screen. Anytime the tv comes on now, the cats line up in front of the screen to watch this dvd."
5,Amazing Interest Old Cat,This DVD was amazing and my sister's 15 yr old cat was so interested in this DVD for hours!Her cat seems to think the TV in the bedroom is now her personal movie theatre and will sit on the end of the bed and wait for the DVD to be started. It also is soothing to hear the sounds of nature when you are snowed in from a blizzard recently!
2,"Cute idea, but not for my cats","After three tries my cats still aren't even paying attention to the sounds or the video. My cats are indoor/outdoor, so perhaps they are just used to watching real birds and could care less about TV. My friend adopted two siblings of my one cat, and they are completely indoor cats and I know those cats love the DVD and will walk around the TV trying to find where the birds, etc. are coming from. So if your cats are used to sitting outside watching real birds, then this DVD might be a waste of money. If your cats are indoor cats and you have long work hours, then this DVD is a great solution for curing a cat's boredom."
5,worth the money,"my cats love it, keeps them entertained for a long time, really a great idea for indoor cats, would buy again"
2,Freedom to view,"I love this show, when i found out that we can't buy the Unscented Version of the whole dragon ball,dragon ballz and dragon ball GT Series it made me upset. I feel like as a American its are right to view and own the Unscented Version of these Series. Who do we talk to about this, if some one out there knows plz give us there email so we can be heard"
2,IT SUCKS!!!!!,"I AGREE WITH THAT GUY I MEANT TO GET THE UNCUT BUT SOMEHOW I GOT THE EDTIED VERSION OF THIS SAGA IT IS NOT FUNNY IT CUT OUT ALL OF THE NUDE SCENES LIKE ON MASTER ROSHIE'S ISLAND AND THE PUFF-PUFF SCENE,BULMA'S PANTIES,THE BULMA PILLOW SCENE ALL COMPETELY GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Uncut version coming in 2004, hopefully.","If you are wondering why the first boxed set of the Dragon Ball series is edited while the others are uncut it is because Funimation doesn't have the rights to these first set of episodes (Pioneer has them, I think). According to Funimation, they should get the rights back some time in 2004, and they promised to released an uncut version at that time. So, if you are like me wanting to watch this exellent series from episode one in all its uncut glory will have to wait until then."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"Even though it is the first 13 episodes of Dragonball, it was not the dubbing I was wanting. I will probably send it back."
3,censored and only english and spanish,"I love dragon ball, and was excited when I saw the original episodes being sold. I was disappointed that the DVD didn't have the original Japanese language, and that some things had been censored (for example, when Goku swims to catch the fish in the begining he is wearing swim trunks, however in the original he is au natural. other example, to get the dragon ball from the turtle elder, bloomer shows him her panties in the original, but this version completely deletes the whole scene.)"
4,My review,"It was good. Didn't really like the editing they did, it just didn't look right, and took from Toriyama's original story, and humor, but good otherwise."
1,Dragon Ball is not anime,"It's to bad Amazon.com doesn't have a zero star option. This is one of the worst CARTOONS! (Non-anime) of all time lack of story, plot, theme, mood, character design origionallity, well it doesn't have a lack of redundancy is the same fight over and over, and over, drug out over a period of hours. Don't watch induces birth defects, i suggest if watch imedietly after induce vomiting and call physcian. (Mr. Wang"
2,Wait for the uncut set,"The first thirteen episodes that started it all. However, it is the highly edited versions. I suppose if you have really young children, it is alright to get this; but I suggest that you wait until funi releases the uncut episodes."
3,UNCUT! UNCUT! UNCUT! UNCUT! UNCUT!,"release this uncut please!!! they have released every other saga uncut but why not this?! you can see HUGE differences on this DVD! yes, i still watch it but please release this uncut! NOW!!!"
2,Not the best,Thia saga contains the original 13 episodes of the great Dragon Ball Tv show. But sadly its only available in the edited and dubbed version because FUNimation (the company that released all the other un-cut sagas) still cannot get the rights to these episodes from the company that originally released them
3,Wonderful and disapointing,"Wonderful, but as mentioned before it is EDITED for your 5 yearold brother. All the jokes, anecdotes and gems that make dragon ball dragon ball have been removed... would not have purchased if i had known. But all in all its still very funny!! I just wish they would release the origional... hint hint funimation... ; )"
2,grossly depressing,"I bought this DVD expecting to see what I was expecting, the original version of the cartoon, I was dissapointed, what I found was a sadly done effort to entertain young people. With its poorly butchered story ""saber of light?"" and the shameful plugs to cover the nudity, ""my,my look at the moving stool!"". I was saddened, there was not even a selection to see the unedited uncut version with subtitles, shame on FUNi for putting us through this debacle of depravity, if you are a long time DBZ fan, do not get this, especially if you have ever seen any of the original material of either series."
3,Five and below,"I've been a fan of the series for a while and I bought this set knowing that SOME things would be edited or cut but was completely unprepared for what I found. Edited over body parts (fine), rearranged scenes (#$%*!!), and dialogue rewritten to the point that jokes and even entire storylines were lost. Most of the humor and character development has been totally lost. If you're buying this as an upgrade from Barney videos for your son or daughter, fine, but anyone preteens or above are going to be very disapointed."
3,the severly edited episodes,"After watching this one can tell that this was not the recent releases done on cartoon network. If anything after watching this it brings back the thought that this was once released years ago in a severly edited format. Not to say that this is bad or anything because for the most part the story arcs are still there. However the most comedic elements of these episodes like when goku first heres about a bath and Bulma has to bathe him, or the severe pervertedness of Master Roshi are all edited out and replaced with dialouge that is corny or removed entirly. This is an allright set at the right price, and good for little kids. But for fans who have been getting the sagas that funimation has been releasing as of late, I would not bother."
3,English Version of Dragonball,"I bought this was going to be the coolest DVD ever. On the box its says original Japanese version but thats B.S. They cut out all the funniest parts that are not suitible for children. Also on the box it says it has an interactive game but all it is is a stupid quiz, but what i really hate is that it is only in english. They have english subtitles available but no Japanese words to go with it. If you want to get the whole story get the comics. Even though it is missing all that it is still ok and has all English episodes and the movie Curse Of The Blood Rubies. I just wish that they would make a better DVD set that was unedited, had Japanese language available to hear it in, and had a better Chapter selection. Maybe Pioneer could buy the rights and make a real anime DVD."
1,an alternative,"Yes. this set sucks. but funimation has already released the UNCUT set on a 2-disc region 4 dvd set. it contains english dub uncut, english subtitled uncut, and original japanese uncut. go here: http://www.ezydvd.com.au/item.zml/225572"
5,"Funny, amusing, delightful entertainment for all ages!","First time I have seen Dragon Ball. My 4 year old son wanted the set. We all watched them. Some of the stories repeat each other in a round about way, but are still very entertaining to watch. Very comic at times and packed with action. A must for every collector of Jap anime shows. Highly recommended!"
2,Edited and not original,"This DVD set edits out much of the original. I personally do not like it edited and would like to see the original version. Some of the voices don't sound like the original and they put this cheap looking underwear on Goku. It looks bad if you get this DVD.DO NOT GET THE REGION 4 DVD FROM AUSTRALIA!!!!!!!!!! You can not play this on any American DVD player unless it specically says that it is multi-region. That is going to cost around 200 dollars! It may work on your computer, but I rather watch it on my TV. I am almost positive that they will release the same DVD set you can by in Australia in America in the region one coding. We just need to wait a while. The company is almost done releasing all the Dragonball series on DVD and only have the Tien and Pilaf Saga left. Just be patient and it will eventually come out in America."
3,Cool but edited,"I made the mistake of buying this one at Best Buy without doing my homework beforehand. I really wish the company who packaged this dvd set would have put a big sticker labeled ""EDITED VERSION"" on the box. Some of the coolest scenes have been yanked out to avoid angry parents. Boo hiss. Still entertaining and worth buying though."
3,electric dreams soundtrack,"I remember this movie and I'm disappointed that the cd here is not the real soundtrack from the movie, it's good, but there is a bit missing with this cd as compared to the music in the movie.I agree with Blanchard from Alabama review, it just wasn't mixed right perhaps."
3,"It was the eighties, you would have had to have been there","As unfashionable as it may be to hearken back fondly on the eighties, particularly the synth-pop music and almost quaint fads and fashions, this is one relic worth saving. Even if the computer in ""Electric Dreams"" is a dinosaur compared to today's machines, the music still remains as listenable as it was then. The highlight is Boy George's silky smooth voice on ""Love is Love."" Say what you will about Boy, the ""man"" could sing."
4,"Once seen, never forgotten","This movie inspired me to learn to play the cello and I hope one day to be able to play the duell and madelines theme. If anyone can tell me where you can get the scores, I would be most grateful."
5,Rome: Total War PC,"The game is really awesome. The sound is really good. I like the main screen song.The cavalry charges are cool, I love it when you rush into a bunch of archers, they go flying!The only thing I don't like about the game is that it always seems to me the AI is trying tocheat on me, for instance, in skirmish, when I have hoplites, they always go to the side, whichreally upsets me because they should come straight at me. I had a showdown between 2 specialunits, the DRUIDS v.s. BESERKERS. I had the Berserkers do a war cry and instead of standingand yelling at everyone, they burst into battle and I had no control over them. I did like theending."
5,Kirby Vacuum Power Cord,The power cord on our Kirby Heritage Legend was frayed and needed to be replaced for safety reasons. The replacement cord fit exactly as the old one did and works fine.
2,"Good, but broke",I've had this unit for exactly 3 years and it was good during that time but now the DVD tray door won't open.
4,"a quiet, sweet romance","A collection of down-on-their-luck genteel folk run a hotel in London called The Poor Relation. It is a bit of a scandal to their better-off relatives, but it keeps the folks in scratch. Most of the time. At the moment the group is in dire need of funds, and they are up to their usual tricks -- sending out one of their own to pretend to be an obscure relative of someone rich, then having them pilfer small but valuable objects. And rather bashful Mrs. Budley has drawn the short straw. Now she must toddle off to the estate of a doddering marquess, little knowing that the marquess has died and the estate is now in the rather capable hands of his nephew. Oh dear.This is a quiet, sweet story with amusing characters. Not a page turner, it is eminently satisfying as a literary bon bon. I will read others by this author."
4,"Love it, but handles could use a revamp","I love the product. Keeps my papers and binders in order. I have space for my snacks, tissues, hand wipes, and everything!The only negative feedback I have is regarding the handles. They could use a redesign to make them more user friendly.But I would definitely recommend this product to others."
4,Be organized,Got this for my dad - before his truck was a slew of mail and papers - worked out well.
5,Fantastic quality coconut oil!,"I use this in my cooking wherever I can. I also use it for skin/hair, etc. and it works well. I love that it's unrefined yet extra virgin and organic."
5,Great Coconut Oil,"This extra virgin coconut oil is in white color, very very pure, and the taste of it is just heavenly. I use this oil to cook recently and surprisingly it goes very well with some vegetables (especially bok choy, cabbage) and eggs too.I started to use this oil after reading some research saying coconut oil is a good healthy oil comparing to those hydrogenated vegetable oil. Unexpectedly after taking this coconut oil for three weeks, I realized that my acid reflux symptom mainly stomach pain was completely gone. Now three months have passed, I have not had any stomach pain. To give you some background I had to take acid reducing meds from time to time in the last two years.I also use this coconut oil as body lotion and hand cream, my husband tells me that I smell wonderful."
5,Smells like summer!,"I use this item to make my own whipped coconut body butter. Excellent price-point for organic product, and smells fantastic. I have not used it for cooking or baking, but did taste it on arrival - great quality product. Will buy again!"
5,Yum yum yum.,"I just looooove cocoanut: the smell, the taste, everything. This oil is amazingly full of both flavour and smell. So far I've used it in cookies, sauteeing veggies for a curried soup, and spread on warm waffles with fruit sauce. My husband likes it spread on toast. I am very pleased with this oil."
4,Great for cooking,"I know there are many, many applications for coconut oil, of which I have only scratched the surface. Call me unimaginative, but we used this oil for cooking.We made soup a couple of weeks ago, and used the coconut oil to saute the vegetables before adding in the broth and other ingredients. This oil has a fantastic coconut smell when you open the container. I wasn't sure if it would impart too much coconut into the vegetables, but it did not. The aroma was wonderful, but the veggies did not taste heavily of coconut. We added curry to this particular soup and the oil was a great compliment to the soup.I was worried that it would overpower things, but so far it has not.I haven't yet been adventurous enough to try it for a hair conditioner or some of the other things my friends have told me work, but I would definitely buy it again for cooking. It's a nice change from olive and canola oil, for certain."
4,Coconut Oil is Great but I have a concern,The coconut oil is great! My issue is with the packaging. PLASTIC.Everyone knows that there some leakage of the plastic into the foodor liquid being stored in the plastic. Mercola's coconut oil ispackaged in glass. More expensive shipping but healthier in thelong run.
1,Beware - this is PULP not tablet,"Hard to use - if you don't refrigerate - I'm afraid won't last long - but if you do, gets hardened and can't pick with spoon."
4,Smells divine,"After reading an article that I found online titled 101 Uses for Coconut Oil I decided to get some. This oil is different than what I've tried before and the first thing I noticed was that it has a true coconut scent, the other one I have is unscented. I also read on the label that this should be refrigerated after opening, which makes it very hard to use. The oil hardens into a cold mass which is nearly impossible to chisel apart for measuring. I did use some to make some popcorn with and it tasted amazing. The packaging was a little hard to get into, but once opened it was easy to close and reopen. This oil is quickly becoming a favorite and will replace the other brand of coconut oil that I have in my cupboard, mainly because this has a full coconut flavor which enhances the food that I prepare."
3,It's OK,"This stuff is OK. Nutiva has a stronger coconut scent and has a richer flavor (I prefer those qualities).The price of coconut oil keeps fluctuating, so since I'm on a tight budget, sometimes I need to go by cost. If this stuff is cheaper than Nutiva, I'll buy it. If cost wasn't a concern, I'd switch brands. I do like Jarrow for taste and aroma better than Spectrum."
4,Good Stuff,"This Coconut oil taste great, well maybe it just smells great. I have been using while training for a half-marathon. I am not sure if it was the varied training, or this product, but I was able to keep the pace, with negative splits for the final 3 miles. I like it and have ordered more."
5,theater popcorn with coconut oil!,"The latest advice in diet books is to cook with coconut oil. Lots of health advantages, in spite of the high fat content. I remember when coconut oil was almost banned, and carbs were good. Coconut oil is expensive, yes, but it still makes the best popcorn. I also used this to saute mushrooms, peppers, potatoes and other veggies, but the taste will take some getting used to. I finally learned to love olive oil versus butter, and I need to *taste* the reasons to switch and see the research confirming coconut's superiority to olive oil. This item by Jarrow doesn't show up at my supermarket yet, so it's a no-brainer to stick with olive oil for now. If grocers start stocking this item, I might keep it on hand. Meanwhile, I'll enjoy my popcorn while the trial product lasts."
4,Great product could use packaging improvement,"This is a wonderful product, with everything I would expect in a good coconut oil. The reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is that the plastic jar it comes in has a very sharp/rough edge inside the opening lip. Since coconut oil is solid at room temperature, it has to be ""dug out"" of the jar, and as one digs further into the jar, one's fingers or hand tends to strike this edge, which can be very painful. I've had several jars of this coconut oil, and all have had this same issue. But, obviously, I still consider this product a good enough value that I'm willing to put up with it."
3,"Good product, bad packing","I've purchase various brands of Coconut oil & have had great experiences. As soon as I received my Jarrow oil shipment, I noticed the liquid stain on the box. Once opened, I found that everything else I ordered plus my packing list was covered in oil. Thank goodness everything else was in special packaging so I was able to remove the soaked cardboard backings, making the clean up tolerable but I was disappointed at having lost some of the precious oil. Other than that, a lot of the oil was saved and it was great."
4,Not my first choice for cooking,"I think this is a good product, especially for skin care purposes. It is expeller pressed though. Which is much better than using chemical solvents but expeller pressing can create higher temperatures. Higher temps could mean a loss of nutrients. Companies go this route because it increases the oil yield and is better for their bottom line.For cooking and supplementing I useNutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Containers (Pack of 2)which is cold pressed. Cold pressing isn't as efficient for the manufacturer but it preserves the nutrients and quality of the oil."
5,Wonderful!,"Fast delivery..received the product in 2days!! This VCO, smells amazing, so much better than the refined ones I have used in the past. EVCO has great health benefits. It keeps my hair thick and shiny, it helps to boost metabolism and lose weight, and it is great for acne and blemishes. Hope everyone enjoys this product as much as I do!! =)"
5,Very entertaining,"With this being my first foray into the world of erotica (besides the occasional Penthouse Forum article) I must say I was very pleased. All of these stories touch us deep down inside, some more prevalent than others. The characterization of some of the main players in the longer stories is excellent. Not only do these sotries deal with sex and the physical please, but also emotional repercussions-good and bad. I have read this book numeerous times and look forward to purchasing other ""Mammoth erotica"" collections."
5,The Good Ones Make The Book!,"Like many other collections of erotica, some of the stories were lukewarm at best. However, one in particular (The Dress) was hot. If there is one story in this collective that will stir something up, this is it. Ranging from voyerism and exhibitionism, to humiliation and lesbian sex, it covers a wide range of sensual and strong images with a well-written turn of words.That story alone gives this book 5 stars."
3,Nice looks- but may not be durable,"I purchased this watch and it arrived semi-functional. When I attempted to set it, the display blacked out and it then stopped responding to any input whatsoever.I was going to return it (very unhappily), but the manual suggested changing the battery. I took the back off and got a new battery handy, but as soon as I popped the clip on the battery, the watch started working again! I have no clue what happened.So- the watch looks nice (if a little ""chunky"" - but I like chunky) and has a display that you can read in just about any situation (assuming you can read it in three seconds or less) but I am a little wary about the overall quality control.That's why I rate it only three stars - if it had just *worked perfectly*, it would have gotten at least four stars from me, if not five."
3,It's not what I expected!,"It's not a bad book, but looks more like a magazine, it helps you only if you have the Kama Sutra, and about ""The tantric art of love"" I think there are better books about it, it was not what I expected, the drawings sometimes are too small and it has some information that I think most people find not helpful in tantrism."
2,Not what I thought,"Unless you like to stand on your head and have sex, this book is just amusing for the graphics. Most of the positions in this book are not for most people. I can't imagine anyone being able to actually have sex in the positions noted in this book."
3,Ouch! This stuff is d-d-d-dangerous!,"You may want to consult a doctor before trying the circus tricks illustrated in this one! Prepare to be amazed by the techniques within, but be very careful as there is serious chance of injurying you or your partner here - especially if your sheets are sheer & slippery. You may feel the need for boots. Might I recommend steel tip for extra durability & luster, they really provide the traction needed for DEEP penetration.All the positions are covered here and included is a handy guide on where to place all your parts - like a game of twister. They could have come up with a few more though as my parter and I went through the whole list in about a week. Now I understand why there are so many Indians in India - they LOVE to bone - just like me, Rich G"
4,Great for the self-paced learner!,"I used this book to take a Word 2002 class over the internet and it's one of the better books I've seen. It comes with the CD with all the documents in a easy to organize format, very useful there's no long downloading from the net. Each lesson gives detailed step - by - step instructions. Good real world examples of projects. I've used almost everything I learned in the book on my job -- sometimes the very next day. Great for someone who is wanting to improve their job skills without going through the trouble or expense of taking the class. Very good content -- the only draw back is that the book is VERY thick and sometimes had to handle on a typing stand. Spine is not very strong."
1,Microsoft Word 2002 Spiral Book,I never received this book or any communication from the seller.I have not received a refund as well. This seller is on my black list.
3,Still a good buy.,"Since recieving the hoe I have found one at a Ace Hardware store. The price is about the same in the store as I gave. I was a little disapointed that the hoe was made in China, not the good old USA. The hoe is not a one piece forged unit. The Socket is welded to the gooseneck but the pieces are obviously forged. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase."
4,a must-to-read book,"If you major in mathematical economics, you come across this book again and again. This book includes topological vector spaces and locally convex spaces. Mathematical economists have to master these topics.This book will be a great help for not only mathematicians but economists. Proofs are not hard to follow"
3,"Amelia, Emerson, Nefrit and Ramses take on an Arab army",Ramses and David are English spys and take on Arab munitions dealers. Of course Amelia and Emerson save the day. Finally Nefret and Ramses get married.
1,Silly Book,"I make it a point to finish every book I start - I really had to push myself to finish this one. From the opening set - which is not explained until the end - and maudlinly at that - it was a bit of a bore.If you have a long flight across country and then back again it is okay to read this to pass the time. All the main characters practically wear an S on their chests - that is they are all supermen - appearing at the right spot every time, some crisis occurs etc. And of course they never appear to get any sleep. At least it didn't interfer with my trip - which was great.If one is interested in Egyptian archeology - there really isn't much here for you - but then one gets a good intro to the byways of Cairo and its environs."
4,Redeemed!,"I love the Emerson Books but I was upset by the things in Falcon at the Portal. Needless to say I couldn't wait for Thunder to come out. Rushing out and buying it; I sat up and read it in a day. Redeemed! Everything I wanted to happen in Thunder happened, and she didn't cheat! Now my heart rests easy, He Shall Thunder in the Sky was fantastic."
5,Outstanding - Wonderful - Fantastic........!,"I really don't think I have to say more. Elizabeth Peters has done a wonderful job with He Shall Thunder in the Sky. I just hope with all of the closures she will not stop writing about the Emerson family. After all of these books, the characters have become like family. We have watched Ramses grow from being an irritating brat to a very handsome, sexy, appealing man - just like his father. It would be very hard to let them go at this point and not know what happens further with their lives. Again, this book was the ultimate in fantastic. Congratulations, Ms. Peters and thank you."
5,The best one yet!,"How can Elizabeth Peters- Amelia Peabody series keep getting better? The depth, the humor, and the adventure of this series simply can't compare to any other."
3,A GREAT READ!,"HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY is a wonderful tale of mystery and suspense. It has all of the charecters that Peters fans have grown to love, plus the dawning of WWI. How will the Emersons face this troubled time, and still get some archealogical work done? Find out by reading HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY, and if you enjoy it half as much as I did, you will want to read it again!"
4,He Shall Thunder in The Sky,"I liked the way the way Amelia showed how much she loved Ramses. The plot was well thought out. I was glad to see the Master Criminal again, He was always one of my favorite people. I was sad to see him go. Finally, Ramses and Nefret are together! I was really happy with that turn of events. I wonder if she will be pregnant in the next episode. Food for thought at least. Over all I enjoyed the book and it's worth re-reading."
4,Is Sethos still alive?,"I hope he is. We weren't told that he was definitely dead like Percy. It seems to me that we are left to take it for granted. Emerson would know for sure, as he did about Percy, and he may be under orders again not to mention it. There is plenty of room here for Sethos to return. The lung wound might not have been fatal (Nefret had been commenting on it when help arrived) and he could have passed out from blood loss. Isn't it odd that Emerson would not mention burial arrangements for his brother even though he mentions provisions for Molly and trying to do right by him in the past? It is such a glaring omission. Amelia carries us along with her plans to discuss moving the body back to England at a later date so we just assume he is dead.Sethos might operate more freely if everybody thinks he is gone. Since he was (still is?) an agent for the British, he might get his own series of books.This book did tie up some loose ends but created others."
4,Amelia Peabody is up-staged,"Well, somone has finally done it.....someone has finally up-staged the great Ameila Peabody....and the person who does it....her own son....I was so excited to see that Amelia wasn't the first person to solve this mystery and prevent a war, in fact she does little in this book but provide minor clues and insights. This whole book basicly revolved around Ramses and his efforts on behalf of the war effort. He becomes a spy and out-witts the person who hates him the most. (Can you guess? ) The ending is happy and I must say it is about time that Ramses and Nefret got it together. All my suspicians about thoses two were confirmed and then some in this book. It was a true delight to read...."
2,When not all (nor any) is equal(ized),"pb wroteThe recording engineer, mixlogist or post recording specialist must have been distracted. Major kerfuffle in settings and balance."
3,Pastorella that melts like mozzarella!,"I was not impressed by this CD. I have the French Harmonia Mundi recording as well. That one deserves some praise, this one should be used to punish your kids."
1,disappointed with Lillies,"I searched the web for the rain lily and it was advertised as 3 plants. It came as small numerous bulbs which I could've purchased locally a lot cheaper. I assumed that I would get 3 plants per order so I ordered 5 thinking I was going to receive 15 ""plants"" not bulbs with little whispy leaves that 70% have died due to being so small, they'll probably come back next year, but I was wanting 15 plants to place in my newly erected planter box."
1,Very poor book,"This is a very poor book about Andrew Jackson actions to destroy aborigines in the south east of USA. After reading, you realize that is a book from only secondary sources. Not original papers nor any non publish original documents. Is a basic secondary bibliography search and not more."
4,Cheesy but Cute,My 4 year old loves this movie. He watched it a few times a day for a few days. Though hasn't asked for it again but still talks about the movie to people he meets. It's super cheesy but apparently that's okay for kid train lovers.
2,could've been better,I thought the killer was a little obvious and the book could've had a little more suspense. It had no 'chase scenes' or suspenseful parts and the supernatural subplot was too far fetched.
1,Blah!,Why does everyone like this book? Just because what happened in 1965 and the present was related? What I was looking for in this book were the chase scenes and the suspicion of the characters. The supernatural part was overacting for me. The part could never happen.
5,MY FAVORTE SO FAR..............,"I LOVED THIS BOOK!.AT FIRST IT WAS KINDA CONFUSING WHEN THE YEARS WERE CHANGED BUT THEN AT THE END THE YEARS MADE SENSE.THE BOOK IS REALLY SCARY.I WAS EVEN GETTING SCARED WHEN I WAS READING IN MY ROOM BY MYSELF.SO,I READ THE BOOK WHILE I WAS WITH MY MOM!!!!!!"
5,A Captivating Novel!,"From the moment the Collie sets out on his adventure, the book is gripping and suspenseful. It is along the lines of the books about the collie Lad by Albert Payson Terhune. It is captivating right up until the very end! A book hard to put down once you have started to read it. Animals lovers will not want to miss this one."
3,The title is misleading,"Although the title of this book encompasses ""jewelry,"" in the introduction, the author states that he has limited the scope of the book to diamonds and jewelry that contains diamonds, gold, platinum or silver. He omits colored stones because ""they do not enjoy the stability and liquidity of a structured market."" Unfortunately, my interest is colored stones, and had I known that this book was limited to diamonds I would never have bought it. Having said that, if your interest is diamonds and/or gold, then the book can be recommended."
2,how to buy jewelry wholesale,"very basic information, full of obvious suggestions.buy only if intereted in an elementary explanation of the jewelry industry"
1,Not the right pulley for F250 PowerStroke,The Amazon will it fit guide indicated that this was the idler pulley I needed for a 2004 Ford F250 6.0 diesel. It is not...... not even close. The pulley has 6 grooves and the serpentine belt on the truck has 8 grooves. It is also too small in diameter. I am not sure why it was listed as the right one but Amazon needs to change the catalog to avoid confusion.
4,Excellent Book and Service,"I ordered book by ordinary delivery method. The book came on time and I am happy, Thanks Amazon."
3,You have to know what you are doing,"To concur with the other review, this item does have a nice finish. However, be aware that there are no installation instructions included. My husband is fairly mechanical, so he figured it out, but it involves drilling into the wall. Since our house has a stucco finish, this can be a problem if you drill and remove chunks of the stucco, so you had better know what you are doing. I also got this on sale for $6.89, with super saver shipping, rather than the current price of $25, which is way more than this is worth, in my opinion."
5,I LOVE IT...................but don't tell my daddy.,This book is so good. Me and my boyfriend Cory talk about it all the time. I love it sooo much!!! I even tried writting one myself but my bed wridden dad seen it and threw it away and kicked the desk I was writing it on over. Oh well...I'll just have to try again. I think that this book can teach you a lot about life and realtionships. This book makes me want to be Japanise even more so. Well I gotta go I here my dad coming and I'm not supoosed to be on the computer. Qetwrfyegufrhtui that says goodbye in Japaniese.
3,This book is GREAT!,This book is all about a young boy who gets in trouble alot. He always seems to enjoy to annoy Ellen Tebbits. His mother is a dance teacher at the dance school close to his home and has no time for him. In the middle of the book his class does a experiment including two mice. At the end of the experiment Ellen get to take one home but gives it to Otis instead. I thought this book was exciting and I was not able to put it down. Even though i told you some of the story get it and read the whole thing.
3,Always do your school work right!,"The book I'm doing for my book review is Otis Spofford written by Beverly Clearly. I rate this book three star. I rate it this way because I didn't like it, but I kind of did like it. This book is about a kid who needs to do a project but needs a good grade. Otis and his friends do the weirdest project. If he doesn't get a good grade on his work, he will be grounded for two weeks in the summer. If I have to recommend this book I would, especially for people who don't believe in themselves when they're doing school work. If you want to find out the ending you must read the book Otis Spofford.Emerson, NJ Fifth Grader"
2,A lot of endless rambling,"I am a huge fan of the old Hollywood studio era but was pretty disappointed in this book. It's probably a good place to start for someone who hasn't done alot of previous reading or research. To me it was a bunch of babbling and Mr. Mordden kept repeating the same point over, and over, and over(albeit changing the characters)... It didn't offer me anything new so I skimmed thru the first couple chapters and struggled to finish it, but finally just put it back on the shelf.If you have an interest in the Hollywood studios, I would HIGHLY reccomend ""The Glamour Factory"" by Ronald Davis and ""City of Nets"" by Otto Friedrich, I found both of these very interesting - another great read is ""Irving Thalberg: Boy Wonder"" by Mark Vieira."
1,"Short life, even under easy use","I bought this thing for one purpose, to plug into the back of my work computer and snake around to the front, and plug in a set of earbuds. This cord was rarely moved from this position, and rarely were the headphones unplugged. But the cord doesn't pick up both sides of the headphones anymore, and it's only been three months."
4,Bring on more Shiplett,June lund shiplett does it once more with her powerful romances. A truly great read
4,Cyprus the land of garage,The new garage scene that has exploded over the last year has really hit it especially in Agia Napa and this season its going to be big. this CD has all your big garage hit s on 2 Cds and is thouroughly recommended for people interested in the garage scene.
1,I have Forgotten your album.,Gosh! Country music did not really represnt violoence nor did it encourage it. We here have Mr. worley supporting it. I wish (too late ofcourse) he and Toby Keith try to hear How Alan Jackson wrote the 9/11 Song.
1,ANOTHER MUSICAL ARTIST LIVING OFF OF THE 9/11 TRAGEDY!,"When I first listened to this song on the radio, I thought to myself... Great another music artist living off of the 9/11 tradegy. Just like what Alan Jackson did with ""Where were you when the world stopped turning... Please no more making profits off of a terrible tragedy......Get over it! It already happend, we're only human, there's nothing we could've done to prevent it... Just... Get over it! Please!!!NO MORE 9/11 SONGS!!!Thank you!"
5,Some things are worth fighting for...,"And Darryl Worley clearly gets his message across in the song ""Have You Forgotten?"" Regardless of one's political leanings, the melody is catchy, the lyrics powerful, and the overall affect is one of patriotic rememberance. Any proud American citizen should have this song in their archives.And if you aren't a proud American... what are you doing here?In addition, for more patriotic tunes, check out Toby Keith's album, UNLEASHED, another excellent release choke full of red, white and blue pride."
1,Have I Forgotten?,"Why no, Darryl, I do remember it was the Saudis that attacked us on 9/11. It would appear that you have forgotten since you believe Iraq was involved. Nice to see you making a nice hefty profit while our troops are dying on a daily basis. They don't even have adequate water to drink. Only in country music could the public be this naive. Shameful."
1,Horrible excuse for country music,"I bought this cd last week, listened to it, then threw it away. It is that bad. If you like real country music, take a pass on this one. Darryl Worley is not talented, ..."
1,Disgusting Jingoism,"On September 11th, America suffered a horrible loss. When Darryl heard about it, I'm sure cash registers were going off in his head. What better way to capitalize off of tragedy than feed off of people's sensitive emotions. And how does he go about doing so? By suggesting there needs to be more death and violence. He suggests that we're right to be looking for fights, but with who? Now even the Bush administration said there was no link between al qaeda and Saddam. Oh well, I'm sure Fox News will use this as the theme song to everything they deficate out as news programming. Shame really, music like this only encourages terrorists to target us."
1,Don't Let Facts Get In The Way,"The first thing Darryl forgot were the facts by trying to blame Iraq for 9/11 when there has never been one shred of evidence to support that. What will be next for Darryl a CD blaming Canada? There is nothing patriotic about using lies and falsehoods to push a political agenda, this CD is nothing but a poorly conceived attempt to cash in on post 9/11 patriotism and it does so in the wrong way. Darryl should apologize to his fans for this blatant attempt to cash in on the 9/11 tragedy."
5,Don't let others tell you otherwise...the best!,"Don't let others tell you bad things about ""Have You Forgotten?"", this is on of the best songs out here today!Darryl Worley isn't trying to sell this CD, this is what he believes, as I do as well as my family.This CD makes some people mad because it's TRUE!If the people serving our contry didn't, where would we be?Take your mouse and click ""Add to cart"". You'll be glad you did!"
1,I haven't forgotten.,I have not forgotten that 14 of the 18 terrorists in the WTC attack were Saudi. I have not forgotten that Iraq had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. I have not forgotten that 3000 people died because of Operation Ignore Terrorism by the Bush Administration during the 9 months ( minus 1 month of vacation) Bush ignored the threats.This song is garbage. The guy who wrote it apparently doesn't know what facts are.
1,"Sentimental, right-wing claptrap","Darryl Worley's ""Have You Forgotten"" begs another, more relevant question -- ""Do You Read the Paper."" Despite the fact that Hussein's Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the Twin Towers. To xenophobes like Worley, the Middle East is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people. He justifies our warmaking with cliched references to ""our freedom,"" apparently oblivious to the irony that the Patriot Act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the Bill of Rights. He accepts the Official Version of 9/11, despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through. I've heard some pretty reactionary stuff on country radio before, but this song definitely takes the cake."
4,excellent patriotic music,"im not a huge country fan but this is one fun album. the music is fun patriotic and up beat its pride of America which makes it even better i think everyone proud of the USA can relate to ""Have You Forgotten"" though my personal favorite is Tennesse River Run."
3,Magnum Fault,"Jill, Cody, and some of Cody's closest friends (like his dog Riley and Joe Tiotec) try to solve a mystery that begins with the disappearance of Jill's father after they were in a car crash in the mountains. Her father was a geologist for a gas company called Magnum. Jill's father finds out a dark secret about the company he works for (which is why he was kidnapped in the first place)."
5,Best MOM's Calendar,I have owned one of these calendars for the last 4 years and they're great. There's plenty of room to write in any and every activity for each and every day. It's the perfect size to place on the counter top for everyone to see what's going on each day. Every busy mom needs one.
4,I will definitely be getting another one for next year!,"This is a must have for any mom on the go! There is plenty of room to organize EVERYTHING. There is a lot of space to write in details for each individual day. My only ""complaint"" would be that I wish it had a month-at-a-glance at the beginning of each month to make it a little easier to see what's coming in the month ahead. Overall, the Mom's Plan It is the best tool I have ever used! I will definitely be getting another one for next year."
5,best for busy moms,"This is the best calendar I've found for busy moms. Grocery list, things to do, stickers, and easy to reference. Also fits in your bag or purse easily. Love it!"
5,i love this,"it's good for me, I leave it opened on my desk. YOu can tear off the perforated pages for shopping lists to go is so neat. I will buy one for next year too!!"
2,twice as much is half as good,We bought the work out CD because we had a tape of the first one. the second work out is a total washout. The first silver foxes is a good buy and a good work out. It is too bad thet the second workout is so poorly thought out. My wife and I think it is a wast.
5,Exercise for Seniors,I purchased this DVD as a replacement for a VCR that has been used for years with a group of seniors at our church. They love it. It is gentle and yet works all areas of the body. Those who have consistently attended the sessions are in great health & condition. Most of them are in their 70's.
5,Best product of it's kind on the market bar none!!!!!!,"I have been in the computer buissness for many years. I have spent considerable time battling virus's and spyware. Panda brings all these problems to a screetching halt. I hear my co-workers complaning about what their internet security programs have let through, and I simply tell them to get panda, set it and forget it. You will not go wrong with this product!!!!"
5,An understanding of mental illness,"At first it seems that Karen is just a normal girl going thru the ""teen phase"". But then she starts getting into trouble with teachers, friends, and at home due to her extreme mood swings.When her mother overdoses on pills, Karen finds out that manic depression runs in her family and realizes that she's not crazy.The POV from Karen's prospective shines new light on mental illness and proves that no matter what some people believe, you just cannot control extreme emotions by yourself and it's ok to ask for help."
4,Midney On Top Of His Game,"Caress is melodic, inventive, probably Midney's best work. It keeps the embarrassing, grade school vocals to a bearable minimum. It well utilizes the East European melodies so inherent in Midney's compositions. Two stand out tracks (""Charmed,"" ""Love Spell"") are hypnotic and compelling. ""Love Spell"" would be revisited several years later by New Order in their dance track ""Perfect Kiss."" As always, his disco works better for listening than dancing. Along with Beautiful Bend, this represents the best of the Midney projects."
5,Charmed By You,"With the release of this Boris Midney production, ""Caress"" originally issued in 1979, he delivers another fabulous Eurodisco album. It lives up to everything he recorded under the Beautiful Bend and USA European Connection moniker. The album starts off with rhythmic ""Catch The Rhythm."" The albums highlights are the seductive, mildly erotic ""Charmed"" and ""Love Spell."" A true gem for any serious Disco/Dance music lover! Highly recommended!"
2,Overpriced and Underwhleming,"With the advent of the sub-$200 HD-DVD players flooding the market, the honeymoon period for this nasty little beast is long-gone. Don't be tempted, as I was, by its ability to play JVC HDV files natively. It is spotty at best and truly unnecessary given the alternatives available.If you do dive in, be prepared for the laugh-riot butcher job of the English language that is the manual and the remote is hopelessly arcane. Boot time for this makes Haley's Comet seem all too frequent and simply navigating the menu is enough to drive all but the strongest of us to anti-depressants.A/V connectors are loose and unreliable and the DVI output is severely crippled. Front-side buttons are cheap and flimsy and seem to have a high false-positive ratio.This has been on the market for some time and is ready to be retired. It's time to let it move on. Let go."
3,Not good for Palm Z22,"While I think the program would probably be good, it's not useful on the Z22 due to low screen resolution. I am not sure why you'd want to buy it for the Tungsten, TX or Lifedrive since they already have a version of it and this is a high price to pay for a simple upgrade of software."
4,"""Do One Thing Different!""","This book may just as well have been a poster. It was an interesting, and well written book. Just as the word 'change' implies, we must do things differently than we did them before. Change is not easy. The author points out throughout this book that even the most minute changes can create massive results. Do one thing different--read this book!"
2,Minimally Helpful,"I was able to pick out a thing or two from this book, but nothing that would really be especially helpful for more than a very brief period of time. I can see how this book might be helpful for someone who is simply stuck in a rut, but not necessarily for someone who is dealing with trauma. Depending on the situation of the reader, there are a few 'band-aid' type solutions that could provide a temporary distraction and it might also be helpful for someone who just needs, as the title states, some ideas for a bit of something different."
2,Tedious and cheesy,"Also poorly acted. At first I couldn't get the downloaded video to play. After some trial and error it did work but is not transferable at all to a mobile device. The movie itself is obviously low budget with no actors you can identify with. This makes it hard to ""get into"" the story."
2,"Only one thing wrong, but it's a big one . . .","This is a great, simple phone for those who just want a phone for making and receiving calls and text messages. Reception is quite good and battery life is great -- I go days and days and days between recharges. However, the plastic cover over the display is tinted and mirrored so that it is virtually impossible to see the display outdoors in the daytime. Most phones, especially basic ones like this, are difficult to see in daylight conditions, but this one is impossible. It is so bad that am going to be getting a new phone, even though I will have to pay big bucks to do so. This is my fourth (or fifth?) Nokia phone and the first one that has disappointed me."
4,Worth reading if you want to join....,What I found interesting about this book that was different from the ones that I have read before about the FFL are the personal stories and comments from les Anciens (ex legionnaires). It gives the reader a different view of things and you get to read it from the men who where there and not only from somebody who spent some time with the legion. What I didn't find good was that the book spent to much time in the past and not enough time in todays legion. I think most people looking for material of the FFL want info what life is like today. But it is still worth reading. Mike...
3,"funny, if a bit dated","I first read this book in junior high 20 years ago when I was home sick with the flu. As a budding feminist, I was appalled by Berger's ridiculous lampoon of the Women's Movement, but I was entertained nonetheless. In fact, this book came up during a conversation over lunch just a few weeks ago. ""Regiment of Women"" is no where near as good as ""Little Big Man,"" but it's worth a read if you can find it at your local paperback trader."
1,"If you're looking for a Fem/Gender book, look elsewhere!","I am a fan of Gender-switching, Fem Sci Fi & Utopia/Dystopia novels... I read everything that I can find that claims to be such... This one was such a disappointment! This is a world in which women rule and men are subservient -- but, to RULE..the women must strap their breasts flat, wear fake mustaches and wear fake groin bulges! They are gruff and crude and vulgar and everything that stereotypes A MAN. Men, on the other hand, must wear fake breasts, skirts, makeup and can only be secretaries, everything that stereotypes a woman! All the story does is frustrate the reader AND beg the question: why go to all the trouble re-creating a world in which all the same stereotypes exist? My humble suggestion is to read Pamela Sargent or Nicole Griffith or Paul O. Williams or Sheri Tepper or Marion Zimmer Bradley ...you'll have a much better time!"
4,Enlightening and insightful,"This book provides valuable and historic information on African Americans in the entertainment industry (primarily film and television). Sought out in researching Gordon Parks, I found the book less useful for any depth of information on Mr. Parks but excellent in its introduction and overview. Particularly satisfying was the book's spotlight on the less known facts and challenges that faced and continue to face African Americans in film and television."
5,Speechless!,"I'll make it short cause usually I go on and on.The compact disc has blues written all over it! deep down guitar and amazing harp.Buy it, Buy it, Buy it."
4,One of the games that get you hooked,"Six words: THE BEST SLY COOPER GAME YET. The location is much bigger, the story is much better, and the fun is much cooler. I love the jokes and gags but there were several stuff that really bothered me. First, it's short, second several of the mini games like hacking into computures and picking locks are really annoying.But for people who love tense and funny games, check it out. But i suggest renting before buying."
3,"great game, but....","It is a great game, but after I finished the Black Baron level and went to the next level, the game stopped. It keeps doing this after I restart. Other than that, it is okay"
5,SLY COOPER 3: HONOR AMONG THIEVES,"In my opinion, Sly 3 is the best of them all. The plot has nothing to do with Clockwerk, but that's ok. I also liked the new members. Penelope and Dimitri were funny. The gameplay is the same as Sly 2, with the exception of Carmelita. Overall, it's completely better than Sly 1 and 2. Can't wait for Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time!"
4,son is happy,this was a hard find for my son. I was pleased to find it & at a great price. Arrival was fast too.
5,Great,Its like new and works great. I enjoyed the game and it looked new and everything is perfect. Haven't found any defects yet.
5,WTF!?!?!,"Sweet Man! I just got this game and it's off the hook! Sly returns in like his 3rd and supposebly final adventure as he recruits some new and familiar faces to pull of a world class heist unlike the 2nd and 1st game. You can play as Sly, Bentley with his super-cool steriods wheelchair and the stupid hippo guy. This time around though, you'll get to play as the incredibly hot and sexy Inspector Carmelita Fox where you will be attempting to stop Sly. Plus, the game also features exciting bi-plane sequences, co-op modes, and a pair of 3-D glasses to use during certain sequences! Trust me, if you have played the Sly series, get ready for the ride of your lifes."
4,Still Playing Sly 3,"The sly games are like interactive cartoon movies. The developers did a great job on this series.I didn't play the original, I tried a demo on one of my other games and decided to get this since it was a cheap game that I know I would enjoy.I like the humor and light hearted gameplay. Still playing through it. It will take me a while since I don't play often.I recommended this if you enjoy humor and just enjoy platform games."
4,My kids love it,"Its a cute game for kids, and will give them hours of enjoyment, mine play it over and over again..."
5,Players get gyped!!!,"Excited....you bet, this game was the very best of all the Sly's, except there's just one little bitty problem...when you get to 57% completed, THE GAME IS O-V-E-R....that's right fans, the game company ripped us off. So, what up with that? Plenty, the seller should refund us 43% of our purchase price, that's what! Maybe there's a second half to part 3, that we don't know about or a second disc that we were cheated out of?"
1,SAY IT AIN'T SO DANNY JOE!!!!,"I would not say this album stinks, but considering the kind of band Molley Hatchet was supposed to be, a southern rock band, this work does not fit in with what Molly Hatchet was intended to be. I would only recomend purchasing it if you are completing your collection, otherwise, stick with the first five Hatchet albums. REALLY!!!!"
5,Highly Recommended,"This book provides you with the constitution, its background and history, important cases, and how they were decided. It also provides an explanation of articles, clauses and sections.During the recent supreme court nominations there were a number of pundits providing mis- and disinformation regarding the constitution. This book certainly helped clarify what the constitution really meant.Another word used more freely in the past few years is treason. From book titles to charges, I was able to learn through this book how the founding fathers defined it and why they made it so hard to use.So,In order to perform a more perfect knowledge, ensure your intellectual tranquility, and the achieve the security of a perfect argument, I recommend that you exercise your inalienable right to purchase this book, and secure the blessings of life, liberty, and the pursuit of ""well-informedness."""
3,"Great yoga towel, just not for me!","I love the variety of colors and designs these towels have. And for the average user, this is probably a perfect yoga towel (price aside, perhaps). I only gave it three stars because I have a few issues with it that others might have as well.1- I own the Manduka BlackmatPRO and the nubs on this towel just don't seem to work properly with my mat. The towel doesn't stay put as well as I would like it to. Might work better with other mats?2- During hot yoga, I sweat buckets. This towel does a mostly decent job of absorbing my moisture, but I feel won't be enough for heavy sweaters like myself. Though not the worst offender among my different towels, this one gets soaked to the point of occasionally making those embarrassing wet ""fart""-like noises towards the end of class. One is too much for me.If you don't mind the price, have a compatible mat, and don't sweat a lot.... this could be the towel for you. It just isn't the towel for me."
3,it's pretty but dont buy in white,white is pretty but it gets pretty. dont use a clothes softener with this one as it will make you slide and lose balance. after a few years it does not hold anymore. i kept sliding and then i realized it was because of this. I would have expected it to last longer.
2,Towel Disappoints,"This was a gift for a yoga enthusiast, she is quite disappointed in this towel. She is slipping when she uses it and that was the main reason to get this one, because you supposedly won't slip. I cannot recommend this product to anyone because of the slipping problem. This towel looks great but sadly isn't performing."
5,"Skidless, just as the name suggests!","I have 3 of these towels now, to rotate through the week -- 2 in white, 1 in grey. I love these towels! I only do heated yoga (mostly bikram), so having skidless towels was particularly important, because I don't like having to move my towel around mid-practice. I'm now able to keep my towel in place for the duration of the class (even during warrior pose) without ever slipping.Plus, for someone who's a bit OCD, it's nice to have a towel that perfectly fits over my yoga mat. This is especially helpful if you take classes that get packed, where you don't really want to add more width to your space."
3,Love the Quality - Not Great for Action on the Mat,"I love the design and think it's very smart! And, once the fabric is a bit wet, it's perfectly in place but, when dry it's very hard to move through vinyasas. And, I love that it gives me a warmer surface when practicing Yin poses. I'll use it for sure but wished it stays put from beginning of practice."
4,great so far,"I held off on buying a Yogitoes for a long time. I saw lots of other Yogis and Yoginis using them, but it just seemed really expensive for basically a towel. Well I kept having problems slipping on my mat, so I finally went for it and man, it's been great so far. Slipping problems are gone. I don't even have to wet it down, like so many people do. My body heat and the heat in most yoga classrooms, my own sweat, all these create plenty of friction and I have not had any problem slipping on it.I also like that it extends the life of my mat. My mat was beginning to tear up down at my feet, and so far it seems like the Yogitoes will really extend the life of my mat.Occasionally I need to reach down and straighten it out here and there, but nothing major, really not much of a problem.I got the moss color and like it.The only reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is I haven't had it long enough to see how durable it is, but so far it looks and seems pretty durable after a few uses."
2,Not worth the money!,"I slid all over the place on this mat, even after spritzing it with water! It's extremely overpriced, save your money. The Angel brand is just as good at half the price. Luckily, I was able to give it to my boyfriend, he's not picky!"
2,Mat for yoga,"This mat I use in my hot yoga class.....serves the purpose, not as absorbent as it looks on the advetisement."
5,it works,"I have found myself sweating during yoga and slipping off the mats... I tried lots of different things - hemp mats, yoga rugs etc.. but this towel thing actually works and it is LIGHT to carry around . It does bleed in the wash -- but I presume that goes away after a few washes.It's a simple product and it works well."
3,"Great Product, Not Recommend this Color","I love the Yogitoes Skidless Towel, I cannot do yoga without one. This color is beautiful, but it still bleeds when I wash it. I have probably washed it 5 or 6 times at least and it has to be washed by itself still. This is more a Yogitoes problem then Amazon or the seller."
4,Slip free,I have been using this over my slippery yoga mat for over 3 weeks. It has certainly made my Vinyasa yoga experience slip free so far.
5,Love it!,"After reading lots of reviews I purchased this towel and it has made a big difference in my yoga practice. You do have to get the hand and foot area a little wet so you ""stick"" - but I'm not slipping all over the place anymore. Love it!"
4,Nice towel,"Nice towel. I love the color and the symbol on it. I do however feel like it does bunch up at times during my practice. It adheres to the mat fairly well to keep me from slipping, but I find myself having to straighten it our more often than I would like. It washes well and fits my large mat quite nicely."
4,Sweat Mopper,"As mentioned in my other review for the smaller towel, this white towel does a really good job of mopping up sweat during hot yoga. I did end up ordering more yoga towels in the tie die color because the white color shows every mark. I do slip on the towel a bit, however, it does give you much more security than no towel at all. This may be due to the mat I have underneath, which is a biodegradable mat with jute interwoven. During my practice I find that I must smooth out the towel because it bunches up, but obviously, this is not a deal breaker since as you see I've given this 4 stars. The towels works better when it is slightly wet. Also the fact that it keeps your mat underneath cleaner is a nice bonus."
3,Defective item,"I bought a yoga towel for my husband at a yoga studio and paid regular price but they engrave the name for the same price. He really like it so I decided to buy one for my true Amazon and found one for less money. When I got it I notice that was not first quality since it has a couple of dark spots. I was disappointed but kept the yogitoes towel any way. The product is great, specialy if you sweat during yoga. Also the reverse side can be use for accupresure. If I was going to do it again, I will buy it at a regular store because I don't like the imperfections. Hope this information is helpful."
3,Love/Hate relationship with this towel,"I have a love/hate relationship with this towel.Pros:- Nice size- Beautiful (makes me feel so happy!)Cons:- I can feel the nubs, and they bother me- Very thinEven though this towel makes me feel so happy when I see it, I can't get through an entire yoga class with it. I always end up tossing it to the side. The nubs actually hurt me, although perhaps I'm too sensitive (the Addidas sandals from the 90's, with the little nubs that you stand on, hurt my feet as well).In the end, even though it's pretty, I really regret buying this, especially for how much I paid for it."
4,yaga towel,I purchased the yoga towel for my granddaughters birthday & she really likes it. She is very satisfied with the way it works & the way it washes up.I am disappointed in the ordering method used by Amazon though. I will think twice before I order from Amazon again.I got stuck with shipping charges & Amazon will not credit me for the charges. Too bad as I was consdering ordering another towel. Oh well.
4,Works well,Works as advertised. It stops you from slipping all over the place. 4 stars only because I question its durability after multiple washes.
3,Disappointed,"OK for traveling to place on a bare surface, but bunches up on the mat and provides no better ""skidlessness"" than an ordinary mat surface."
3,Not really Yoga-novice-proof,"I bought the skidless mat, since I was bound for a summer Yoga-Retreat on Crete (Greece). I imagined to sweat a lot and from my experience sticky mats then tend to become not so sticky anymore.I found the skidless mat OK, however not great. When you are not part yet part of more flexible Yogi-family, it's probably more a product to look forward to using once you are more ""pretzel""-person, since otherwise you might get frustrated of what this mat is offering you.My teacher I made this mat a gift, loves it. She definitely is Pretzel-Woman. So, decide for yourself. Hope this helps.Now one week later... I feel like adding to my prior statement. I kind of like this mat, even so I'm still not-Pretzel-Man. This item needs to grow on you. So it's +1 star to 4"
3,Color fades quickly.,"These work as intended, meaning when you're holding Down Dog in your sweaty Bikram class you can actually hold it rather than ending up in the less-graceful Embarrassed Starfish pose.I bought two: Lakshmi - Poppy for my beau and Ganesha - Teal for myself.This particular color (Lakshmi - Poppy) is gorgeous for exactly one wash, then it fades to a much more subdued ruby-burgundy.When they say wash it before use, DO IT.Trust me.Nothing I have laundered in years has bled as much as these towels. It took five wash/dry attempts (done gently and per instructions) before I got minimal enough bleeding. I still probably wouldn't trust these towels with very light-colored clothing + a sweaty, hot class. Also, the surface isn't particularly soft. I guess I expected a little more of a cottony feel, but the towels definitely do the job. (I found Yoga Rat towels, without nubs, at a discount store, and those work just as well without the color bleed.)"
2,Not skidless by any means and watch the washing!,"I agree with the reviewer who said this doesn't work all that well, especially in downward dog (which is where you really need it, after all.) I even brought a mister to make it a little damp (as reviewers recommended), but I was still slipping. And then when transitiong from one pose to another, it can bunch up and leave you with something else to do - horse around with your towel - while everyone else has taken the new pose. In the middle of an hour and half session I chucked it and relied just on my Jade mat and an occasional wipe of the hands. Also, I was surprised to see so many 5 star reviews for a product that, as indicated on its own ""care tag,"" bleeds in the wash AND says it can stain your dryer (which is why I ordered white.) This could be a disaster for those who don't pay attention to care tags. Other than some dark denim, which I wash separately with Woolite dark wash, I don't have any washables that pose such a danger."
5,Fantastic,I am a beginner at yoga. I perspire heavily during my heated yoga class & sometimes felt I was going to slip on my oun sweat. It is hard enough to try to balance on one foot without worring about falling due to sweat. Love this & recommend it.
5,No More Slipping!,This was my second Yogitoes Towel purchase. I always had problems with slipping and sliding during yoga and this towel helps immensely. It's also alot easier to wash than a yoga mat; just remember not to put it in the dryer. It will dry really fast if you just hang it up. Namaste!
3,"Not bad, but not great","I got this to help with slipping during a ""hot"" yoga class, because I sweat like a pig. It definitely does help, but two things I don't like: 1. it's very slippery when dry so I have to make sure I wet it before use, not a huge problem but I like to keep things simple so a little annoying, and 2. It bunches up at times, not as bad as a regular towel but enough that I'm still searching for a better solution. As far as color bleeding I just followed the instructions to wash twice before use and had no problems with an orange towel.So, definitely an improvement to what I had before, but my search for the ultimate hot yoga mat solution continues."
4,Really like the skidless towel,This product is very good. It is very helpful for the classes where the heat is up and your hands and feet slip on a plain mat. The towel really grips in and helps you hold the poses and feel more steady. The instructions say you can use the towel dry but I find that the I get the best slip-prevention when the towel is damp...especially at each end of the towel.
5,Great Product!,"If you are considering buying a yoga towel I highly recommend this product. I have had no trouble with this mat and it has provided me much stability throughout my yoga practices. Definitely pays for itself several times over! Unlike others who purchased these towels mine did not bleed, though this could likely have something to do with the neutral color. Don't wait to buy one of these!!!!"
4,I like my towel.,The towel works but only if you wet it and make sure it is clean for every class. I think a regular towel would work but they are not the same size as a yoga mat.
5,Love it,"I take hot yoga classes and am always by far the sweatiest person in class. I have a great mat, which I though would be enough, but halfway through my first hot yoga class I was sliding all over the place. The instructor gave me her Yogitoes to use and it made all the difference. I bought one at the studio the next day and ordered my second (and one for my Mom) from here. Now I do not go to class without one, I highly recommend a Yogitoes for any hot yoga class."
4,"Perfect, almost!","Love the pattern and it's the perfect size and thickness for a yoga mat, but, it didn't stick very well at the beginning of class (when still dry) near my feet. I needed to fold it over so that my toes were in contact with the actual mat. Otherwise, I felt like I was shifting slightly. I will still continue to use this towel though since it was clearly much better than a regular bath or beach towel."
3,skidless towel,it works to keep the skidding down but not as much as I had hoped. One needs to wet it down to keep hands and feet from skidding. If the vinyasas are fast the towel will bunch up. Be sure to wash it in the tub several times by itself before you toss it in with regular laundry because the dye does run.
5,Perfect Product... Perfect Amazon,"The item was shipped overnight - thank you Amazon Prime $3.99. The towel is perfect for hot yoga since it doesn't slide under the sweaty conditions. I looked at cheaper Yoga towels as well, but sometimes it pays to get the more expensive name-brand and not have to worry about the quality. This was an excellent example of ""you get what you pay for""... in my opinion.I'm not sure how I lived before I could buy stuff off of Amazon haha."
5,BEST Skidless Towel,I have always wanted a skidless towel and would highly recommend this product to anyone who practices yoga. You will no longer slip when practicing (due to sweaty palms) and your mat will not get stinky because the towel will soak up your sweat & you can easily wash it.Great price (significantly cheaper than buying it elsewhere) and well worth the money.Perfect gift for the Yogi in your life!
4,yoga mat supreme,"Yes - I love my Yogatoes mat. However, with shipping and your price I WAY overpaid! This is disappointing as I saw it for $30 - exact same mat - at Sports Authority. And not on sale or on a promotion. So ...would not buy this from you again. Sorry."
3,did not work for me,"i don't know if i'm doing something wrong, but my towel would not stay put! i even sprayed water on it before each class, but the towel would ALWAYS move or get scrunched up easily. yes, the towel helps me from slipping all over the place, but it's not as great as what the other reviews are saying. i just got it a little less than 2 weeks ago and have used about 8 times. I've been air-drying it because i'm afraid the heat would damage the little stickies at the bottom. regardless of how much i try to take care of this, it still would not stick to my mat. i'm disappointed because it costs way too expensive to not do its job."
2,A little disappointed....,"I practice hot yoga quite frequently, and I needed something that would cath my sweat (I know, kinda gross) as well as keep me from slipping.While the YogiToes mat does stay in place for the duration of the class, it does not keep me from slipping... if anything, it makes it worse!If I were in a traditional yoga class, out of the heat, it would work fantastic."
2,first yogitoes purchase,"After seeing many fellow yogis use these in class to keep from slipping on their mats, I saved up and bought one. After reading the cleaning instructions carefully to avoid the bleeding of colors onto other clothes, I washed it separately. Unfortunately, my first washing caused the edging/stitching to become unraveled. Just a bummer for a $45 product. I have yet to fix it or use it because once it's used, it needs washing and will continue to fall apart. Returning defective products purchased on the internet is loathsome. I had better get out my sewing machine and start stitching...if only I had the proper type of thread. Ughh!"
4,It's worth the price - this towel is great!,"I love this mat towel. It is the only one of it's kind (that I've found) and whoever came up w/ it is a genius. I bought it about a year ago and attend classes 2-3 times a week. Needless to say, it's been through a lot of abuse and washings (I air dry b/c it's ""greener"" and b/c the tag said it might stain the inside of the dryer) and it still looks & works great. It's very helpful in giving you a little bit more stability from slipping/sliding on your mat (we live in a very warm climate, so perspiration is an issue). I've found I can try more intense poses with more confidence, and less slipping."
2,Too much bunching up underfoot.,"This towel does prevent sliding (especially if you dampen it before practice) but I find that when I move my feet the towel tends to bunch up and shift around on the sticky mat, so I have to keep stopping to smooth it out. I've had much better luck (at a lower price) with the Mysore practice rugs sold at barefootyoga.com. The rug lies flat and stays flat, and costs $15 less."
4,Nice Towel!,"I purchased this towel for my hot yoga classes, and it really made a difference.No more slipping & sliding on a sweaty yoga mat. Nice product, well made.I don't quite understand why they are so pricey, but I couldn't find anotherbrand or option that was less expensive, so I got one.I bought the sand one, as some reviews sited that the other colors had a tendencyto bleed on your clothing when wet, also when washed. I have had no problemswith the sand colored towel."
5,Don't leave home without it.,"A must for hot yoga. Just started doing hot yoga around 2 months ago. Wondered what all the fuss about a yoga towel was all about. I sweat alot in any active yoga class. But, now that I know, having a yogatoes skidless is te only way to make it through a strenuous hot yoga class without either slipping or constatly realigning a non skidless towell."
5,"Beautiful color, and stays in place well","I bought this for a hot yoga class. Prior to having this I literally slid right off my mat due to sweaty palms and feet. It was nearly impossible to keep up. Once I got this mat it was smooth sailing. I highly recommend hot yoga, and I highly recommend this mat!"
4,"Great for preventing slippage, soaking up sweat!","These towels are wonderful for reducing slippage during yoga and hot yoga classes. The top of the towel is super-absorbant, and the bottom has rubber grips that stick to your mat to prevent hand and foot slippage during poses. The towel has really helped me feel more secure in my poses and makes extended down dog or warrior poses much easier to bear. It should be noted, however, that this color towel does show sweat, and any sweat marks will show up on the towel in a darker color (though they dry fairly quickly). Another downside to the towel is that it bleeds in the washing machine during every wash. It's turned a few of my white towels blue! I'm not sure if this is true of colors other than the teal, but I would recommend washing with darks only all the time. I thought I would be okay after the first few washes and that wasn't the case. Still, overall a great product which I'd recommend to anyone practicing hot yoga!"
4,Yogitoes Review,"I like my yogitoes towel once it gets damp w/ sweat. While it's still dry, I slip on it more than I would just the bare mat. Once it's damp though it works great!"
3,a little disappointing,"I had high expectations for this product, and so far, it has come up a little short. I do like the idea of a hygenic barrier between myself and the yoga mat, especially if you are using the mats at the gym or yoga studio. However, I find that the towel is not exactly ""skidless"". It slips around a lot more on the mat than I was expecting. I find it harder to really plant my feet and hold a pose than when using a mat alone. I still continue to use it, but I think I might just buy a new yoga mat for myself and skip the towel."
5,Totally beats a beach towel,"This towel is fantastic! I used to use a beach towel and slipped all the time. This towel does slip a little, but it's 100x better than the beach towel. Definitely a must, especially for anyone doing hot yoga."
3,nice,I like this one too too bad it costs more just because of the color. Its really not any better than the yellow one . It must be just for the cause and thats too bad because if someone really wanted help a cause they would not jack up the prices. y
2,Did not meet expectations....,"I wanted to use this mat on top of a mysore cotton mat. It slipped all over the place. I almost fell down when doing standing asanas. Then I tried it on a concrete floor. Again, it did not stick as I hoped it would. It might stick on a 'sticky' mat but I don't have one of these to try it on. In general, I found it too 'scrunchy' when moving from one side to the other in such standing poses as triangle, warrior, etc. I did not return it (and gave it two stars) only because I decided to use it for more static type poses such as practicing moving from plank to chaturanga back to plank or from down dog to cobra back to down dog. As long as I don't have to move my feet quickly, it works on a mysore mat or other cloth-type mat."
1,Ordered Mat sized towel and received hand towel,I ordered the Mat Sized Towel and received a hand towel. Beware when ordering!
4,Better than a towel!,"I purchased the Yogitoes Skidless Premium Mat Size Yoga Towel and I love it! I have always had problems with slipping (my feet and hands) in my Bikram/Hot Yoga class and this mat helps. I still do slip a bit, but my teacher recommended pouring some water on my mat and that helps. It is definitely better than a towel. I even bought a second one."
4,Just what I was looking for,Before I was slipping off the regular mat big time. This was perfect addition. A little pricey. Almost as much as my mat. But works great. It soaks up the sweat and I am not slipping anymore. Colors are a little funky. Make sure to check them out (front and back).
4,Must have for slippery mats,"I got this towel because my mat was very slippery. I love it for hot yoga. I've found that i have to be care when I wash it and not use too much soap or the cloth gets to soft and my hands and feet slip and slide... Overtime my mat has gotten less slippery with washing and use and I haven't needed the towel. I also have a hard time washing it after each class, I attend several during the week. If your mat gets really wet in yoga class, then this is the perfect mat for you. I carefully priced these online to find the best price. This color was by far the cheapest and i could beat the price anywhere. I ordered it along with my mat and the arrived in just a few days."
3,Yogi toes,"This product did not turn out to be as good as I had hoped. It seemed to get rave reviews. I thought that it would keep me from slipping during inverted poses, such as down dog, but I slipped even more! Also, the towel wrinkles up when you turn your feet into different positions. If you are simply doing floor work and need a clean surface to lie on, then this would be a good product for you. It was a waste of money for me."
5,Great for those sweaty hands and feet!,"I mainly use this towel only for my hot yoga classes and it hasn't disappointed me at all! I use it with the Lululemon align mat (which causes me to slide a lot) and it sticks on really well, and especially well once you start sweating. I haven't noticed really any bleeding with the one I got (springburst) but it might be because I put it in the wash with all my dark clothes. I usually just air-dry the towel after the wash, and it dries pretty quickly. It is a little bit on the pricey end but I think it's worth investing in a piece that you will use if you practice hot/bikram yoga regularly."
3,"Too soft, not as good as the one I brought 2yrs ago","This one too soft, not as good as the one I brought 2yrs ago. I won't recommend it for this price."
2,not impressed,I am just not impressed with this product at all. I'm glad that i got it as a gift because otherwise i would be trying to get my money back. It wrinkles up is a static machine and isn't even all that absorptive in the first place. I'd take my good old rug any day over yogitoes.I only like it because it's orange
4,Service was great!!! Quick delivery.,I loved the products. Only thing was that I prefer to have a hand size towell without the rubber (with matching colour).Your service was efficient and I will use your store in the future again for sure.Thanks.
3,"Gorgeous Designs, but Still Slid on Towel...","i was so excited to receive this towel to use during my hot yoga classes...washed it per the instructions. no problems with bleeding. BUT...for the price, i expected not to slide around while doing poses. the towel is thin & absorbs very well (kinda like a chamois). and the sticky bumps on the back of the towel really helped keep it in place on top of my mat - the towel never moved! but i slid when shifting into some of the lunges...so i ended up clenching my toes to the towel - hoping not to slide. i would describe the towel as being thin & tight - like the berber carpet of towels. if yogitoes made a thicker version, i would try buying another...i really love their designs (they're so much fun)! for now, i'll stick to the thicker yogarat towels (not as pretty/fun), but i don't slide at all on them!"
3,Yogitoes...some woes,This yoga towel was great at first. You have to wet it or sweat in order for it to really stick to your mat. I put it through the wash- gentle cycle- and let it hang to dry. It piled and looks a bit ratty.
3,There has got to be a cheaper option,"I mostly practice vinyasa yoga. I tend to slip forward on my mat often, and I was referred to the Yogitoes towels. When it arrived, I was somewhat underwhelmed. While it mostly works, I still slip during my practice sometimes, and these towels are absolutely overpriced for what they are - towels with little rubber nubbins on the bottom. Wait for an imitator and save your money. I wish I could return mine, but since I have already used it, I will keep it.If you absolutely MUST buy the yogitoes, at least buy the cheapest color. They are absurdly priced."
5,Very satisfied with towel,After slipping on my mat in yoga class I decided to purchase a towel. I was surprised to see how much they were but overall I am very happy with my purchase. Yogi Toes had a great reputation which is why I purchased it and I couldn't be happier. I am thinking of buying a second one!
5,Awesome yoga mat towel!!!,"I purchased this skidless towel after a friend in the bikram studio recommended it to me. I love it!!! It is very absorbant and does not wrinkle beneath me. I will purchanse another in the near future. Now that I have this one, I don't want to use the non skidless type I have."
5,Most Awesome!,"I have just used my Towel for the 1st time in a Hot Yoga Class. Not only did it soak up every bead of sweat keeping my mat dry but it did not shift an inch!. A quick peek around the class allowed me to see the usual bunching of towels and yogi's pulling out of poses to fix their towels. I felt rather smug with the ability to continue on with the flow of poses without this need to stop. My hands nor feet slipped either! I washed my towel twice (as per the VERY clearly stated washing instructions)before use. Once with a small amount of vinegar. I bought the teal colour and have not had any issue with the colour running.These towels are not widely available in Australia and are also very, very expensive. If you are from Australia and have read about these towels, DO IT!!!Namaste"
2,"Not ""Skidless""","I found that my hands were slipping a lot on the mat when practicing yoga in my living room, so I dropped about $50 on this towel. Pretty disappointed :( I have standard carpet, not the real fluffy stuff, but my hands still slide forward a lot in down-dog, so unfortunately I can't get very deep into the pose at all. I think I was better off before; maybe this would work on a very hard floor, but not on carpet as the description states."
4,Great towel for warm yoga classes,"I ordered the Yogitoes Skidless Premium Mat-Size Yoga Towel after I saw other students using them in my warm yoga class. Without the towel, my mat got slippery once I began to sweat. It is much easier (and probably safer) with the towel.Here are a couple of helpful tips on the towels: First, wash the towel BY ITSELF several times because the color bleeds. One downside is that as I have used and washed the towel several times, the color has started to fade.Second, spray the ends of the towel before class begins (in the places where your hands and feet would go in Downward Facing Dog). When the towel is dry, it is too slippery to hold poses. If you get a spray bottle and wet it slightly, it helps you to keep your traction."
3,yogitoes,"Product very nice looking, however I found that it was often harder to not slide out of my poses than without the yogitoes.:("
4,Pros out weigh the cons,"Pros:Lightweight so you can take it on trips and use community mats, doesn't skid on sticky mats, absorbs sweat great, pretty colors (pink for breast cancer), extends the life of your sticky mat so you can help save the planet :)Cons:Slippery until after first few washes (don't use a dryer sheet/fabric softener - best is air dry), lasts a little over a year used twice a week for ashtanga practice (lots of jumps)"
3,Does It's Job,"The towel does it's job, but I don't know if it was worth the extra money compared to the other brands. It still shifted some. Much less then a beach towel, but again, not AMAZING like I was expecting. I would get another towel. I would not get this brand unless it was on sale again though."
5,"Awesome, no skids!",This mat woks amazing and I have no skids at all it stays put in the mat all through my practice
1,Don't waste your money!,"Manuka makes a far superior product. This product is definitely a third-world country manufacturing nightmare. It is amazing that most yoga studios support this product (they must get them at a super low cost, or women like fashion over functionality). Not sexist, however most classes are about 80% female."
2,Skiddless...really??,"I STILL SKID/ SLIP! I practice hot yoga 2-3 times a week. I bought this thinking it would help with the slipping...it does not help at all, in fact it makes the slipping worse for me. I never use it."
2,"Nice towel, but...","I am relatively new to yoga and bought this towel because it is what everyone was using in class. After I got the towel in I washed it several times and I still slide. The towel also bunches up under my feet and I find myself concentrating more on trying to smooth out the towel during my practice instead of concentrating on my poses. Needless to say, I have purchased a different towel to replace this one."
3,Underwhelmed,"I do Bikram Yoga...so my routine consists of a never-ending stream of sweat. If you've seen NBA players do post-game interviews, that's how much sweat I generate over 90 minutes of Bikram. On the plus side - the silicone nibs do a great job of preventing the entire towel from slipping, but the towel still moves around slightly around the edges. The big downside for Bikram Yogis - the towels were a lot thinner than I expected for ~$50. It's so thin that sweat soaks through it. That means I still need to clean my yoga mat regularly for hygiene."
5,smooth towel,"Yogitoes towels are worth the extra bucks so your towel doesn't move around on your mat when you are changing positions. While it doesn't help you from slipping (only a strong body and good alignment does that) it keeps the towel in place. One caution, be sure to wash it by itself a few times before you put it in your regular load so that the excess dye can bleed out."
2,Absorbant?,"I have been practicing hot yoga for almost a year; at least 4x a week. I am also a bigger guy who sweats up a storm and I was finally interested in purchasing a 'pro' mat and towel versus my beach towels. ""80/20 polyester-nylon blend is super absorbent""....It was hard to tell on the photos but this 'towel' is SUPER THIN and might be highly absorbent but maybe only for a 85lb grandma. Ten minutes into my class the entire towel was completely saturated and at the end of the class when I rolled the towel up with my mat, a steady stream of water poured out of my roll. IMHO this is intended mostly for hatha or people who barely sweat and I am disappointed they try and market this as a HIGH ABSORBENT yoga towel. Not true. Gonna try the Manduka next."
5,Perfect for Hot Yoga,Works great as a towel or to place over your yoga mat for hot yoga. It has little rubber pads to keep it from sliding off. One of my wife's favorite yoga accessories.
5,Awesome yogi towel,"After watching all the cool people in my power yoga classes not slip on their mats because of their yogitoes towel for one year, I decided that I deserve one too. Even though the towel may seem a bit expensive it is definitely worth it! I also learned from the cool people that if you sprinkle water on it at the beginning of class it helps make sure that you never slip. I would bring an extra towel for your face though as it can be a challenge to wipe the sweat off since the towel does adhere so well to the mat."
5,fantastic!,"Love this towel so much that when I recently lost mine on a yoga retreat, I went right home and replaced it. There's nothing quite like it to keep everything in place and is super absorbent. Wish it weren't so pricey though!"
4,Skidless indeed,"Product is really very good. Non-slip aspect is even more effective when wet from water spray or sweat (not a problem in hot yoga). Could be improved by making it 4"" longer to completely cover my 72"" yoga mat."
1,NEVER RECEIVED & SELLER WON'T RESPOND,"If I could give 0 I would. I wish I could put this in a seller feedback and not a product rating but since I never received the item and seller never responded or sent shipping information, it's not eligible for 'seller feedback'. So, i'm having to just warn everyone else not to buy from this seller. I've tried contacting this seller three times with no response.The actual product, btw, is great and there are more sellers to buy this item from. Try Bargain Yoga. So, don't not buy this product because of this review, just find another seller....."
1,dont waste your money,"having practiced yoga for some time now,i found like many others that when the room is warm, youre going through your asanas, that one sweats, it drips on the sticky mat,and lo and behold, you slip and slide and cannot perform properly. i purchased this item in hopes of it correcting the problem. it does not perform at all in this capacity. yes, if it is already wet, it will prevent slipping. im am not going to bring a wet, heavy towel to yoga class, that would mean drying it out after every class, then wetting it again, also adds to weight of carrying it and its unsanitary at best. dry, it is totally useless and slips even after being washed repeatly. dont waste your money.Yogitoes Big Skidless Yoga Towel"
3,"still a little slippery, but better than not having it",this mat helps prevent my hands from slipping but I have to spray it down with water before I can use it. And even after it's sprayed they still slip just not as badly.
5,Worth the Investment!,This product is the cure to slipping on your yoga mat. You'll have no excuses for not being able to complete the most advanced poses. Every yogi needs a few of these in thier wardrobe!
4,Don't skimp - get the real thing!!,"This product is essential for any warm/hot yoga practice. Absorbent, and it stays in place."
5,Great product,"I really like the Yogitoes. Make sure you follow the instructions and wash it twice. I did so and my purple Yogitoes turned my light blue mat purple. However, it is a great product since it does not bunch up on the mat the way a towel does. A word of caution, the Yogitoes can get a bit slippery during a few postures so be sure to squirt some water on it so that your feet don't slip."
5,Great buy,Really great product. Helps a lot in yoga and seems to be made with quality materials so I hope it lasts long!
5,Yogitoes Mat,This is my third Yogitoes towel and I will always buy these for my Bikram's yoga practice- great product! No slipping!!
4,shakin,"Missing ""Angie"" so I was disappointed! Very nice to have a collection of this underrated group from the british invasion."
3,Good used bike rack.,"Great deal on a used bike rack, served the purpose. With multiple bikes on the rack there is a little wobble, otherwise it's fine."
4,Excellent and unpretentious book of manners & etiquette for youth,"This is a great resource for parents, teachers, or youth interested in regaining the lost arts of manners and etiquette. Thought it contains a few things that many youth may never experience, the bulk of the material is useful, informative, and full of relevant examples. Highly recommended!"
5,Another great album from the First Lady of the Guitar,"What can I say! All of Liona's albums are great, and everyone is different yet superb. Finally, this is her first all Spanish album and I just can't get enough of it. Great for entaining. Gorgeous sound quality and great album graphics."
1,Liona is the Queen of Classical Guitar Technique?????,"Yes, and I'm Clark Kent, reporter for a small town daily. Liona Boyd achieved her fame through non musical means. As a musician she leaves a great deal to be desired. Her technique is modest. Her interpretive skills are nonexistent. Proclaiming her ""queen of classical guitar technique"" is only revealing of one's ignorance. I only wish there was a zero star rating.If you wish to hear the real McCoy I recommend Martha Masters."
2,lousy quality towel!,"It wasn't as fluffy or thick as expected, and the colour was more blue than purple (which didn't measure up to the image as well). I could get a WAY better quality target for the same price at Target (which i finally did!)."
5,Super towels!,"Great towels.....they are soft, absorbent and thick. Super value for the money. I would buy them over and over again."
1,These are not Grand Patrician towels!,"I had hoped to match some towels I rec'd for Christmas. However, the Amazon towels are made by Utica and are not Grand Patrician at all. There is no indication they are Martex towels either! I had researched towels with Consumer Reports and Good Houskeeping and do not recall these even being mentioned. I may return them as they look somewhat flimsy. Like a previous reviewer, my set is comng in separate shipments so it may take a while before they all arrive."
3,"Martex New Splendor Bath Towel, Slate -- Fair",The towels and washcloths are thick enough for an inexpensive alternative but the towels' lengths and widths are simply too small.
2,Not what I expexted,"These towels are definatly not as grand as represented. In fact, they are not even the same color. In the photograph, they look like they are slate gray, heck, the color is even named slate, but they are definatly a muddy light blue color. I even looked at the tags on the towels to make sure that I had gotten the right color, and I sure did. They are thin and shed like crazy, even after several washes. Now that they have been washed, they are starting to gather where the band is. The only reason I bought these towels is because I had an amazon gift card. So unless you have free money like that, I would suggest just going to Bed Bath and Beyond or Target. You will definatly get a much better towel there. But if you hold two of these towels together and dry off, it is almost the same thickness as a good towel, so if you buy these, buy twice as many."
5,Perfect,"I like ""normal"" size bath towels -- not sheets. And I don't want it to be so thick it takes 50 minutes to dry in the dryer because I use lots of towels -- no hanging it up and using again -- yuk! This is fluffy and light enough to wrap my hair up in. I wish I had bought more before they became unavailable."
3,O.K. towels,"These are your very basic run of the mill towels. You are getting what you paid for. They were smaller than I expected, but I'm sure the measurements were available. The price is comparable for the quality."
2,Packaging of towels,"I ordered 4 towels and it stated in my email they would be shipped in one package. I was charged for four seperate shipping fees, one for each towel. Three towels are scheduled to be delivered on the 22nd, the fourth on the 25th. I am wondering why my towels were shipped in seperate packages, when the weight certainly did not exceed shipping weight."
5,Death metal to the point.......,"The title says it all folks, this CD is pretty straight forward death metal but it's well produced & very heavy, which is the way death metal should be! If anyone is aware of this band's history, yes former members of Malevolent Creation started this band, & yes this CD reminds you of Malevolent, but what do you expect when Jason Blachowicz (the band's frontman) had played in Malevolent for 10 years or so! After this CD, the next 3 albums Divine Empire put out definitely sound different from each other, but the next best album after this one would be their recent outing 'Method of Execution.' Buy this album if you are a death metal fan, you will not be disappointed!"
3,DIVINE EMPIRE REVIEW,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER DEATHMETAL RELEASES THIS YEAR BY FAR BUT AS ALWAYS THE PRODUCTION COULD BE BETTER,ITS NOT VERY BIG SOUNDING FOR A LABEL RELEASE. SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS RECORDED ON THIN TAPE.THE GUITAR WORK IS VERY GOOD AND THE DRUMMING IS ALSO GOOD EXCEPT FOR A LTTLE OVER PLAYING AT TIMES,AND THE DRUM SOUNDS COULD BE BETTER,THE BASS SOUND IS OK BUT IT DOES NOT REALLY MATTER IN THIS STYLE OF MUSIC/OVERALL ITS A SHOW OFF OF HOW FAST THEY CAN PLAY,WITH NOT VERY MUCH GROOVE TO ANY OF IT BUT FOR A DEATMETAL FAN I'M SURE THEY'LL LIKE IT."
4,I think it is a album that wake up you,"Well when i bought the cd i just known one music, charlie big potato. But when i started to listen i loved the album is my skuns's favorite and i think is the best. but i think too, that secretly video is a litle violent, but the music is fantastic."
4,"sturdy glass, cheap handle",Scanpan cookware is fine. I'm glad replacement lids are available. My wife dropped this lid & the handle broke... oh well.
5,MY SON LOVES THIS BOOK/HE'S ONLY 2 YEARS OLD,"MY SON WANTS THIS STORY READ TO HIM EVERY NIGHT....AND HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY WHEN HE IS TOLD SOMETHING MEAN...SO, I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR KIDS AND ADULTS!"
5,Great lesson for kids,I read this book to classes of primary age kids when talking about how to deal with people who are mean and giving you a hard time. They enjoy it and some even find the hints in it useful!
3,Oh dear Mr Cosby!,This is getting a bit depressing. Sure kids need to be taught how to handle certain situations especially bullying and teasing but this is not the way to do it. Mr Cosby's story only survives once again because of Miss Honeywood's excellent illustrations. A good example of worthwhile material ruined by poor storytelling.
2,A pretty bumpy ride,"After enjoying its loose sequelHi, Mom!, I decided to give this one a try. This is basically just a scattershot series of sketches centering around its three main characters, and only a handful of them really stick. As one might guess, De Niro's scenes are definitely the most memorable, particularly a funny scene involving his attempt at an erotic photo shoot with a girl. The rest of the scenes just meander without producing very many laughs. Plus, the subject matter and style feel very dated, and not in a good way. Also, the amateurish quality makes it pretty clear that De Palma hadn't quite found his feet by this point yet. The follow-upHi, Mom!is absolutely worth checking out though."
2,2.5 stars: Neon Golden it Aint,"First of all, to the uninitiated, start with ""Neon Golden"" - a great album that is one of my favorites of the last 5 years. The question is - if you are a fan of ""NG"" and want more, where to go next. This album is where I went based on proximity in time to ""NG"" and what I'd read. Well, ""NG"" it is not. The best songs here (1,2,3,5,6) are the ones that are closest to NG. After that the album begins to degenerate into something less fresh and ultimately boring (the horns on N.L. and Your Signs sound like bad elevator jazz, Shrink bores). In the end, pick it up if you are a huge fan but don't expect too much. Alternatively, I have been happier finding a post-""NG"" fix with newer, similar fare (try Junior Boys ""last exit"")."

2,CHICANO ENGLISH SPEECH PROCESSING,"I bought this book for the course on ""Instrumentation"" in the Instituto Tecnologico de Mexicali (Mexicali Institute of Technology) at 1991.First: The book does not teach how to design. Instead, it presents a collection of proposed designs. Soon, it was obvious to us that the designs had never been built since they did not work as they were. This would have not been a problem if the professor had not discouraged any change on them.Second: An standard English speaker can deem the phonetics a bit weird. For example, the speech processor consistently devoice the sound of ""z"" in words like ""its"" and ""has"" as it is done in Chicano English. Maybe this can be uncomfortable for a native speaker but for people struggle for acquiring English as a second language, was a terrible source of confusion.Third: It would be good to see the next edition to check if it is better but it seems that it is impossible to find."
4,My opinion,I'm interested to know the great variety of different circuits presented in this book using the speech processing chips. I could see each circuit has been displayed of a simple way which facilitates the learning.
5,Good book,"I am student of electronic engineering, I think this book has interesting things. This book is helpful to students because it has the circuit and software used in each ones of this projects and is easy to understand.Designing whit speech proccesing chips give us good ideas to making better on the future, but also using modern technology for example microcontrollers."
2,AHHH!!! The ethics!!!!,"This was the first Cassie book I have read, and I was not impressed.I am not saying that it was a bad book, but the amount of ""personal conflict"" was too much for me. The ethics discussed, about nature, and when does right end and wrong begin, seemed better suited to a debate team to me. I read these books for entertainment. I would rather not be greeted with a philosophical discussion. I am now off my soap-box. Thankyou"
2,Not so good,This book is not so good. Why did they have to do the skunk stuff? And the termite thing was weird. This is the only ANIMORPHS book I don't like.
2,Worst Animorphs book,"I have read all the Animorphs books up to 34. This one is by far the worst. Do yourself a favor, skip this one and number 11."
2,Hm.,"First of all.. BUY THE PAPERBACK! Why do you need hardcover? Is there really a difference? Anyways, this book was where K.A. Applegate's writing started to go bad. As with all the other books, only read if you are younger than ten."
5,THe Funniest Cassie Book,Usually I don't like the Cassie books as much(except for #19)- but this one was great! From begining to end this one is great.My only problem with it is that everything seemsto fall in to place perfectly sometimes with the Animorphs.
4,Animorphing Time!,I loved this series so much when I was a child. It actually is the sole reason I am such an avid reader today. I gave away my entire collection in fifth grade to my library so others could enjoy the series and have regretted it ever since. So now I am putting it back together buying used versions and treating them with a product libraries use to protect their books. I highly recommend these books they are a quick read and very entertaining.
5,"Not 10, 20!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I loved this book very much. It was so funny too. I almost died laughing. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it really is exicting. The very beging is KIND OF slow, but it really picks up later"
2,"It was sort of good, but I thought it was kind of boring.","I like Cassie because she is calm and mellow but in this one she was way to serious. I mean morphing a skunk just to save the babies, I mean my parents are vets and I know that when a mother skunk is wounded and is away from the kits it is probably best to let the kits go. But I'm not saying I don't like the Animorphs I think they are a very realistic science fiction that makes it some what believable. Which I think is cool!"
1,Torn the second time worn.,"The crotch tore the second time worn. No cuts or scratches, however these pants ripped when I stepped onto a two foot tall ledge. Once torn, the fabric continued to rip from the base of the crotch all the way to the belt line. 32 in waist and 30 in length."
4,Amazing,"The fit is unbelievable, unlike most denim style pants they don't bunch up when you need to extend a leg while climbing ordered three more pairs"
2,Fit is terrible,"Well made....but I purchased 3 pair of the exact size and each pair fit different. The are WAY to long for the length stated. I purchased 34x32. I am 5'11"", 170 and the waist is ok because I like wearing pants on my hips. BUT from the waist down the pants are big enough to fit a 225lb guy. They are about 3in. longer than 32 inseam too. If these pants where true to size they would be the best pant out there. I will never buy another pair. I'm just glad I was able to find them cheaper than the $89 they ask...what a rip off at that price..... Warning try them on before you buy, every pair."
3,Good quality. poor fit,Quality of the material was top notch. Fit was poor compared to Khul pants that I have a couple pairs of
2,Don't judge this book by its cover,"If you are looking for a reference guide, a price guide, or information on many of the items on the cover, this book is NOT for you.The sections, such as they are, tend to be one page of text, much of which is repeated chapter after chapter almost verbatim. The pictures are arranged in rows with little information in the caption - and the price guide is simply a two-page cross-reference in the back of the book.The longest section relates to paper collectibles; handkerchiefs, banners, and pillows also have individual chapters.This is the second edition; perhaps the third will be the charm."
3,Average effort here!,"Since I do not like to write ""long"" reviews, I'll say this and be done. This CD is ""average"" to me because I like my ""Metal"" a little harder and a little more sinful, a.k.a, Motley Crue, Ratt...etc. I feel this would be great CD for the casual / occasional metal listener who's not a die-hard like many of us!! Bottom line....if you like harder, dirty metal, you are not going to find it here!"
5,This album is a rock n roll masterpiece!,"If you like high energy hard rock, you will never regret ordering this album, the first major label release of Hanoi Rocks' short but absolutely brilliant career. This album launched the U.S. promotional work for the band, but then the drummer was killed in a car wreck and Hanoi said goodbye, poised on the brink of international stardom, having already made a huge impression in Europe. This album has a range of great rock songs, all presented in that savvy, over the top manner that Hanoi Rocks specialized in. Hanoi was not a band so much as they were a way of life. This album gives you a clue into their unique energy and perspective. Songs like ""I Can't Get It"" and ""Underwater World,"" the latter of which was a direct inspiration for Guns n Roses ""Welcome to the Jungle,"" are unforgettable. Hanoi is hard rock with a sexually free, street-tough, melodic, punk-informed sensibility. There's no other band like them and will never be."
2,Not as pictured,There is NO sides to the back trailer and the are 2 huge lizards on it .... simply ridiculous ... beyond unhappy about this product!
5,Great book,I think this book is well written. It contains information that any stylist must know before they go into business themselves. I am very happy with my purchase it really has everything I wanted to know and more.
3,Don't throw away your laserdisc!!,this was an epic show....filmed and recorded well and i was delighted to see it appear on DVD....unitl I watched it. In the close-ups it appeared fine but the more distant shots of the band and orchestra are pixelated and not smooth....I wondered if it was my imagination so I dug out my laserdisc and what a shock..the laserdisc is much better! The laserdisc not only features a higher resolution picture but a better color saturation ....and sound!It is shocking when companies release DVDs which do not improve on previous video or laser releases but even MORE shocking when they are a step back...alas this is the case on this DVD. I would rate it lower if the content were not as strong as it is...and it is 5 star.
4,ASPECT RATIO,"Too bad it is not 16x9. The technology was available in 1992. I wish they had used it. Otherwise, this is a wonderful DVD."
4,"This is a DVD, add more of the Songs!!!","Not enough of them. ""Legend of a mind"" and ""Emilys Song"" would have been perfect adds to the DVD. To see Ray Thomas on the DVD strutting his stuff on Timothy Leary would have been a perfect touch. In concert he is fantastic and to deprive us of that wonderful experience is truly a shame."
3,A bit of a bother to play....,"Because it is slightly smaller and thicker than the average DVD, my eMachine DVD player would not recognize the disk. Fortunately, my Sony Vaio did. Quality was as reviewed by others. I enjoy both the old and 'new' Moody Blues and admire the richness of their music. Certainly not for the 'Hip-Hop' or 'Country' fan."
3,NOT TOO BAD,"I'M NOT A HUGE FAN BUT THE MOODY BLUES ARE OK. I WOULD RECCOMEND YOU WAIT TILL IT GOES ON SALE THOUGH. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TOO PLEASED WITH THIS DVD KNOWING I PAID FULL PRICE FOR IT. BUT THE PERFORMANCE ON THIS DVD IS BETTER THAN THE LIVE PERFORMANCE I SAW HERE IN DALLAS TEXAS 2 MONTHS AGO. THIS DVD HAS A BETTER CONCERT ON IT COMPAIRED TO NOW. NOW THAT ONE BAND MEMBER HAS RETIRED, THEY ARE JUST NOT THE SAME TODAY AS THEY WERE IN THE PAST. SUCH A SHAME THAT TIME TAKES IT'S TOLL ON US ALL. YOU SHOULD GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH ON THIS DVD."
2,Pathetic and disappointing....,"Geezz!!! This is my introduction to a Moody Blues live performance on tape. Man, what a disappointment. First of all, what's that thing with two drummers? And Graeme Edge playing like he's on Prozac...Also, I never, NEVER, expected Justin Hayward to play so emotionlee alive. He seems to be playing just for the paycheck, no emotion at all, just going through the motions... John Lodge seems like a Las Vegas crooner, and porr Ray Thomas spends half of the show doing nothing but banging his ""pandeiro"".I like this band very much, but this DVD was a huge disappointment. I'm gonna sell it right now."
1,I ordered A DVD instead,"I ordered A DVD instead, I got a CD of Moody Blues at red rock. Notice how they say under the picture, DVD edition. You're thinking you got a DVD. I am fuming. Firefighter Tim Andrew, Naugatuck Ct."
2,"I was at the concert, I must have been drunk!","I was at this concert when it was filmed at Red Rocks by PBS in the early 90's. I must have been drunk because I didn't remember it being this boring. If you're a fan of the Moody Blues you'd like this. The band looks old and tired. It must have been filmed after their bedtime. I remember everytime they turned the lights on the audience everyone at the concert would boo. They edited this out. This has a lot of the Moody Blues hits. The best part is the 1st half. This is with the Denver Symphony. I fell asleep while watching the second half. It's a good concert to add to your collection. It does looks fair on a big screen in surround sound. Not High-Def. I've been collecting concert dvd's since I put in my big screen and surround sound. This one is at the bottom of the stack.The Eagles concert video dvd is much better. Also, another good one is Celtic Woman. That one is also produced by PBS but it's more exciting."
3,Disappointment on many levels.,"Sadly, this DVD is an over-edited condensation of the Red Rocks performance. Among other things, Ray Thomas' flute extended flute solo was cut out, and it was a highpoint of the Moody's performances of that period of their career. Don't believe me? It's on YouTube and the Deluxe Edition re-release of the CD. With that said, any performance by the Moodies is worth listening to, but I would love to see the whole thing. We miss you, Ray."
3,5 Star content...1 star DVD!,"I am sorry but when I saw this was coming out on DVD I was ready to put my Laserdisc up for sale.....NOT QUITE....the DVD doesn't hold a candle to thte laserdisc for sound or picture sadly.....why? Ask the folks at Polygram/Universal. Others have speculated that this came from a VHS master..I wouldn't be surprised...the Moodies..were ON this night, the concert is wonderful , but this isn't a show to display your system to friends etc.ALSO...I obtained from the UK another DVD....""the Moody Blues, the other side of Red Rocks"" ....85 minutes with interviews....other perfomances from this show and in general a fabulous companion.....NOW if the dolts at Universal had been thinking , they could have added this as BONUS FEATURE material and made the definitive product from this concert....oh yeah, and utilized the digital print used for the laserdisc..."
5,A 25 Year Retrospective,"This is a fine collection of songs that is very well performed and engineered. The only disappointment is that the DVD ONLY has 17 songs on it. The band had, by this time, released over a dozen albums and there is no way to cover such an expansive body of work without leaving out an immense amount of material. This is also a video that you can play with the grand kids running around."
3,Great Concert - Fair Sound Quality,"I looked at all the comments from the customer reviews and bought this DVD because of them (and in some respects, in spite of them). I agreee that the songs were great and the setting is fantastic. But the sound was disappointing. When I play the Eagles (Hell Freezes Over) DVD and listen to this on my system (Yamaha Reciever and Klipsch surround sound speakers) it is crisp and clean with great sound coming from all 5.1 speakers.When I then listen to the Moody Blues DVD, the sound has to be turned up considerably and the quality is not even close.With that said, I still like this DVD and we will listen to it from time to time, but I sure wish I could find another Moody Blues with good digital sound quality. Buy it and enjoy...just don't get your hopes up if you have a quality system and you expect quality sound!"
2,Great Concert Very Old Fashioned Video,"Yes, I know this was done way back, and I know 'real' fans won't care too much, but don't expect too much from the video here.This concert was recorded with old old 4:3 cameras and looks very snurfy.Also don't expect any improvement if it is released as a Blu-ray later, as the original will not be able to be improved to any extent."
3,Good starting point...,"Poetry in the schools is certainly facing some challenges right now. How to eat a Poem attempts to widen the poetic cannon, but fails short on several accounts. Many of the poems are seen in my literary texts, stale and boring. I was hoping for some really new, fresh poems, and on a few accounts I did. The thematic arrangement of the poems was quite enjoyable and it allowed many of the poems to converse with one another, and in so doing, inspired a number of creative writing exercises for my bag of tricks. Overall, I would recommend the book if you're willing to work with it and tweak it for classroom use."
5,excellent intro to poetry,The poem selections are very good and the subject categories are very helpful as well.
4,"good book, but like the Berlitz Sweden guide better!",I am planning a trip to Sweden this Summer and bought 2 books on sweden. (the only 2) This book is good but I like the berlitz Sweden book better. It had more details. I suggest that you get both of the books.
5,Good Go-To Book,"Another addition to my family's survival library, this scholarly work will be a great reference when it comes to the field of ""mixology."" I anticipate the section on ""memorable theme parties"" will offer some great ideas for little pick-me-up moments in what will probably be a very wasteland-like existance when our precariously balanced civilization finally collapses all around us. This book has also helped me choose which ingredients to stock up on. Nice section on garnishes, too."
5,wonderful,"This meditation cd is better than I had hoped for. Of all hypnosis cd's I listen to, this one provides me the greatest relaxation."
4,A good start for newcomers,"If you're just starting to explore this arena, and you need guided imagery, this is an excellent c.d. Headphones are recommended and I would say they are a ""must"". Why? Because the full benefit of the c.d. is very diminished without them. This is a finely crafted, well executed and technically balanced production.Why only 4 stars then? I find the opening music and his accent irritating - but - you overcome those factors by focusing on what you purchased the c.d. for, and if you don't, then you are missing the point of buying it."
2,I DID NOT LIKE IT! ITS PERSON AL TASTE!,NOT TO MY TASTE! BUT IT DOES MAKE A FINE COASTER FOR LARGE COFFEE CUPS. TRIED IT SEVERAL NIGHTS AND IT KEPT ME AWAKE. I WANT ONE TO PUT ME TO SLEEP.
3,"Music is ok, but not for bronze syllabus","I purchased this CD to practice bronze syllabus steps. But, of the 17 cuts on the CD, there is only 1 cha-cha, 2 rumbas, and 1 tango. The rest are sambas, latin fox, bolero, bossa nova, and one pasodoble. The music is just fine for practicing, but not for the bronze syllabus. The selections are in strict tempo as advertised."
2,Polysomnography Workbook and Textbook,Not a very well written book. The format is that of a thesis paper. There are multiple errors throughout the book and workbook which add a level of frustration. This is certainly a minimalist approach to the subject of polysomnography.Not particularly worth the money. I would not have purchased this book had I had the opportunity to view it in person before purchase.
5,"Off the Bus Wolfe Becomes Social Critic, Timeless Insights",Radical Chic is timeless and as relevant today as when Wolfe put his politically incorrect observations down in writing. Wolfe is like a mirror of inescapable truth to those blinded by their sense of personal wisdom and charity.Mau-Mauing the Flack Catchers captures the tidal pond where government and neighborhood activists interact.Wolfe has the eye of a reporter mixed with the sense of story to chronicle events in a way that needs little narration.Both should be required reading in every school of journalism and by every public official in the land.
1,This is nothing but feel good white boy pleasure,"This book is one of the most racist pieces of trash I have ever read. To suggest the struggle for black equality is nothing more than a hustle, shows how shallow a writer Mr. Wolfe is. Indeed, if we get away from his fame, we can easily that none of his works (Acid Test, Bonfires) warrants any serious inquiry.In short, he gets by on white boy affirmative action!P.S.- I gave this book -5 stars."
5,Quintessential Wolfe,"Wolfe is, admittedly, an aquired taste. In this early novel, the author explores race relations during the sixties between blacks and upper class whites in the toniest of New York's neighborhoods. With a flair for verbal word games, this slim volume explores the other side of the Electric Koolaide Acid Test, by pitting well-known black activists against the social movers and shakers of the day, and, in doing so, exposes the false bravado on both sides. This book is a must-have for Wolfe fans."
4,Timeless,"Although I found Wolfe's prose a bit difficult at times during parts of ""Radical Chic,"" I found this book amusing on the deepest level. Wolfe takes a set of circumstances that seem highly peculiar to their place and time, and yet somehow spins a tale that reveals plenty about the constancy of human behavior. I can't help but smile every time I think of Otto Preminger antagonizing the Panther leader--""But you didn't answer ze kvestion! """
4,Still Relevant,"What Wolfe captures so well here is no unfamiliar to the world of the 21st Century. This is a great work that underlines how liberal attempts to better understand ""the other"" often go awry in very funny ways."
4,"Excellent, although outdated anthology","This anthology is an excellent source for the Catholic homeschool, but could use some updating."
5,Crab Shanty,"I was driving to Montauk during the tail end of summer and I tuned into WSHU and I heard ""Where the Road Turns To Shell and Sand"" and my daughter told me not to change it. Great listen, picked up the CD and haven't stopped listening since. Br. Liguori would be proud of you Mr. Berardo!"
5,Great budget par can,"This is a great pro-looking par can for the average joe. Par 38 is the standard bulb size for flood lights and the like, so replacement bulbs are readily available at a store like Home Depot. This particular can is longer than most par 38 cans, which keeps your hot bulb farther from the gel frame for more life out of your gels in adition to getting the light more focused on target. Also there is ample ventilation space between the gel frame and the can, again helping to keep your gels cool. I have not noticed this space allowing any amount of white light to shine out from behind the gel either. A great value!"
3,Could've been better,"I was interested in seeing this movie, so I rented it from Netflix. Anyway, I really didn't care for it. Certain parts were alright, but I could've done without some too. If you want to see a good skating movie, rent Cutting Edge."
1,Horrid!,There is nothing good about this movie unless you like watching German figure skaters trying to rap.
5,la creme de la creme,"Boris Midney epitomizes sophistication and subtlety in dance music. His records transcend the medium and were years ahead of their time...in fact they are timeless for there has never been another producer remotely like him. Even Cerrone, Costandinos, Moroder and Chantereau of Voyage cannot touch him. Additionally Midney plays all keyboards and horns himself and does all the arrangements as well as mixing and cover art. His rigorous training as a classical musician in the Soviet Union is displayed in his unusual structural form as well as his Rachmaninoff-like melodies. Highly reccomended also is his album entitled Beatiful Bend which contains the masterpiece ""Make That Feeling Come Again""."
5,Boris Midney's record of the 70's on CD,"I've been waiting a long time for Boris Midney's records to come out on CD. This CD has the original songs of ""I'd like to get closer"" and ""there's a way into my heart"". I learned to dance the Hustle to this music when the original record went to #1 in the days of Disco."
3,Midney's most typical,"Not as inspired than the companion ""USA European Connection,"" this strikes me as the producer's most typical album. And it's as enjoyable as any of them in its cracked, giddy way.It's Disney World on acid!Frenzied as they are, the string/rhythm arrangements are beyond reproach, surpassing those of Chic and any other string-nutty disco producers I can think of, except for Celso Valli and Ashford & Simpson (if you've read this far, you probably know who they are. Your booty certainly does).As for the much-criticized schoolgirly chorus - love 'em or leave 'em, I say, but dig this: These records are so certain in conceptualization, they might not have worked at all without them.Side A, ""I'd Like To Get Closer/Do Me Good"" is the better twirl... however, ""Join The Dance/There's a Way Into My Heart"" is the circuit ""classic,"" caned to death in recent years by my fave circuit dj's (AHEM, SUSANNNN ????)"
4,Very Interesting,I found this story very interesting and spell binding. I felt I was there with Sarah and Abram and there were made very personal to me! Alot of this may be fiction but seemed to carry me back to those times and forced me to go top my bible and read it! I am looking forward to his next books of Rebekah and Rachel!
2,The American Sarah?,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer who found this novel lacking in cultural depth. The story was okay--if you like OSC's other stuff, you'll probably like the storytelling well enough--but I found myself annoyed throughout the book by the fact that the characters were not Middle Eastern, but American. Card, while ostensibly setting his tale in the Middle East of several thousand years ago, made no attempt to craft characters whose motivations and personalities might have been shaped by that place and time and culture. They all acted, to my mind, like 20th Century Americans, thus rendering the whole story unbelievable and silly to me. While I'm not a huge OSC fan in general, I prefer his sci-fi stuff, where he makes up the place and time and culture and then crafts characters to fit those circumstances. It's more believable to me."
4,Not Exactly The Bible Story,"Orson Scott Card, who usually writes science fiction, turns his hand here to the story of Sarah, from Genesis. He begins with a spunky ten-year old ""Sarai"" and her bratty sister ""Qira"" who will later turn out, interestingly, to be Mrs. Lot. Card takes a number of liberties with the biblical story, but he has done prodigious research, and is able to make those almost prehistoric times, customs and peoples believable. I enjoyed the book and recommend it, but it has some limitations. The characters are one-dimensional and they never seem to grow or change. I was disappointed in the portrayal of Abraham's relationship to God--it was unique and unheard of for his time, not just another religious guy. Still and all, the book was most enjoyable and easy to read!"
4,An interesting story.....,"Although the story is different from the bible, I agree with Card's viewpoint that there can be other adaptations to the story and his is interesting. I do think that it was a little difficult to get into at first but once the story picked up it was a good read. The book demonstrates a strong woman who is central to her family while showing her struggle and the trials of her faith. I would recommend it."
5,awesome story!,"I read it in 4 days, that means I loved it.Sarah and Abraham were so in love with eachother."
4,A Swift Read,"Orson Scott Card has not written the most profound of novels but he does create a multi-layered and complex character in Sarah. He shows her conflicting emotions and allows the reader inside the mind of a fascinating, yet elusive personality from the Bible. This is an easy read and very enjoyable."
3,Sarah,"The novel of Sarah, was about a beautiful and courageous Jewish woman; who changed the course of history through her faith, wisdom, and commitment to her husband, Abraham. I liked this book. I especially liked this books detailed description. It was detailed enough that you can visualize what is actually happening."
1,Too much religious whacko crap,"I was looking for science fiction. Instead I got a double handful of religious crap. Someone already wrote this story. If I wanted to read this crap, I'd read the original, not that the original is any better.I don't mind that Card wasted his time with this book, but it should come with a warning label: Warning - Religious crap.Then I would know not to spend my time and money on it."
5,I'm Into Something Good,"If you ask a random person on the street if they've ever heard of the group ""Herman's Hermits"" they would look at you baffled and say no. But the British 60s group actually has a number of very well-known songs. ""No Milk Today"" and ""There's a Kind of Hush"" are very well-known 60s masterpieces that are still played on some radio stations today. ""Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter"" is another masterpiece (in my opinion), albeit less well-known. ""Wonderful World"" is also well-known, and most other songs on this CD are fun to listen to. ""I'm Henry the VIII, I Am"" is a really amusing song. In short, this is a very good cd...I would recommend it to anybody who likes 60s music."
1,Why?,"On the face, this film seems to promise a lot, but in practice it it is a monument to pretension and boredom. I really find no redeeming elements anywhere. The actors seem to be in a continuous state of catatonia. I have seen my share of slow but excellent movies, for example, ""Ma nuit chez Maude."" Leelee Sobieski's outstanding scene is her vocal fake orgasm. I wonder whether she could do a bit of better acting, or the films she has made are consistently mediocre. Still waiting. Don't get me wrong, she is, as usual, impressibly beautiful. James Hong is the ""inscrutable"" Chinese! My, my, the director, Lang, should know better. A better cinematography could have made this film more palatable. I have seen better in soap operas.In essence, it was a waste of my time and money. Don't bother!"
2,lidole,"this wasn't the movie i was looking for, same title wrong movie, but the quality was very good. thank you"
2,A real disapointment,"I've been a civil war buff since 1959 and was really looking forward to this book. Save yourself the money and follow the following instructions.Fill in the blanks:""On____(date) at_____(civil war engagement), ____(rank) of the _____(unit) gave _____(name of opponent)_____(rank)____(unit): Check one: water, blanket, coat, bread, tobacco or: moved, built shelter, covered up, built a barricade to shield from bullets, took to field hospital.""There. That's 95% of the incidents described. Very few have more detail or are more involved then that. Admittedly, the remaining 5% are worth reading about but not worth wading through the book or paying its price. A five page article would suffice."
4,Helpful,"I'm really pleased with this book. I especially like that the term ""Learning Differences"" is used. The first few chapters are for people using professionals in the community. I did not find them helpful in my case. I did find the ""non- professional"" terminology helpful. The guide has specific ideas that can be implimented in a non-school, non-professional, parent controlled enviornment. Very parent friendly book. Also supportive of the alternative of homeschooling for children with these differences."
4,An excellent bluegrass/folk mix.,This is not typical Dan Fogelberg. In this CD he shows talent for upbeat bluegrass and gospel-like music.
3,Dan does Bluegrass,"If you are a die hard, true blue Dan Fogelberg fan you will like this CD. If you like bluegrass, you will probably like this CD-though it isn't as masterful as those artists who are known for their bluegrass roots.I really enjoy this CD. It is a completely different sound for Dan, but I think he pulls it off. Dan Fogelberg is my all time favorite musician so I am definitely biased-keep that in mind.I do have to say that of all Dan's CD's, I listen to this the least. Most of us love Dan for his particular style and this is definitely a departure so it isn't as ""familiar"" a sound. That is why I gave it the 3 star rating."
4,Very nice CD!!!,"Great CD for a great Price. Bought it, because of the Song ""Sutter's Mill"". Can just recommend this one. Seller mailed it out quickly. Cover had a crack, other then that I am happy with it.Thanks!!!"
4,"Great follow-up to ""Stuff""","Holly McNarland took five years to release a follow-up to ""Stuff"" and in that time I wondered if she was ever going to release a new album. Thankfully, she did and ""Home is Where My Feet Are"" is a masterpiece! Most of the songs are slow and beautifully sung and exceptionally produced. While ""Stuff"" was a great album, I have to say that Holly's new album is wondeful!"
4,Good for book beach or plane,"This is the first book in this popular series. It had mystery, action and was well written. Perfect book for a trip, beach or poolside."
1,If you like science fiction you might enjoy this absurd rubbish,"If you are going to get into William Bernhardt don't start here. You will read this and never want to continue. This is his first novel and the plotting is terrible. The mystery is set up well enough but the unravelling makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. You get about 80% into the novel and then the unlikely protagonist makes his appearance for no clear reason. No explanation given for his crime. Nothing. Terribly, terribly disappointing. Particularly as I have read the other Justice's in the series + Murder One, and I know what William Bernhardt is capable of. Stay away from this book if you like a good mystery. If you like science fiction you might enjoy this absurd rubbish."
3,Definitely a first novel,"I can believe this was a first novel. Although I stuck it out to the end, I felt the writing was less than compelling--this book did not make me want to read more about Ben Kincaid or his faux-French sidekick, Christina. Kincaid is billed as wanting to do the right thing, but seems clearly a fish out of water when it comes to practicing law. He is bullied and intimidated by stereotypical ""shark"" lawyers, wrings his hands over a sex-starved woman who is a partner's wife. Christina calls him a wimp at one point; she is right. Surrounded by unrealistic characters including other new lawyers and his sister, he is in poor shape to combat evil. It's no wonder he is constantly in the bathroom, retching his guts out. For someone who had worked in the D.A's office, why didn't he have any sense of courtroom protocol? Where was the editor on this one? If I get desperate, I might check out a novel further into the series to see if things get better."
4,Awesome! I will read every other book in this series!,"Except for the ""French speaking"" this book was everything I look for! Good main, and especially good secondary characters and a twist and turn plot!"
3,"Good book, horrible editing on Kindle version","I've been a fan of the Ben Kincaid books for years, and was excited to see many of them for $1.99 on the Cyber Monday deals. I'm just over three-quarters of the way through Primary Justice, and the editorial errors so far have been extremely distracting. For example, one sentence says, ""Her features seemed pleasant enough from Ben's distance, but her racial expression was pensive."" I know that it should be ""facial expression,"" not ""racial expression."" That is just one of many editorial errors in this edition. This edition should never have been released with errors such as these. I see that the price is back to $7.69 now. Readers deserve better editing, especially when the price for the Kindle copy is the same as a paperback, which probably does not contain these errors. The book itself is 4.5 stars for me, but the bad editing is what caused me to only rate it 3 stars."
2,"Fantomas, a dissapointment","How can such great musicans (Patton, Lombardo et.c) end up doing such crap? You can't hear mr Patton sing one single word. Too bad if you're a fan of his voice. Never heard of no one who isn't. Mr Bungle have lots of great moments and compared to Fantomas, they sound like Backstreet Boys or something like that. If Fantomas decide to keep on going, they hav to do better than this!"
2,Action/Special Effects Soundtrack to a non-existent movie . . .,". . . and, therefore, virtually useless unless you enjoy sitting around listening to disjointed segments of thrash metal. This ""music"" is too obsessed with comic books for its own good . . . and really, there's no way to effectively soundtrack a comic book, so the average listener (i.e. - not a Mike Patton obsessive) will find the Fantomas debut to be either a failed experiment or an unlistenable exercise in self-indulgence. I'm not averse to thrash, noise or avante-garde music, I'm just not turned on by this record and don't care to ever hear it again. If you find Patton's screaming and yelping to be ""brilliant,"" I've got some recordings of my 5-yr-old nephew I'd like to sell to you.Maybe Fantomas should consider signing on to do the soundtrack of an actual movie; they might find their music serving a more useful purpose . . ."
1,Only imitation of great art,"I used to own this cd and I thought it was absolutely groundbreaking and a wonderfully creative release from Mike Patton and Co. However, I just bought Torture Garden by Naked City. The fact is, Naked City was doing this exact same stuff over 10 years ago! I could not believe that art like this came out back then! Don't get this cd, it is Patton ripping off John Zorn's brilliance. Get Torture Garden instead. It is much more daring for its age and actually just sounds much better, fuller. Mike Patton is mosly ridding the inspirations of other artists."
4,A very enjoyable listen...,"After reading the reviews, I wonder why everyone seems to mention Mr Bungle?? This music is not Mr Bungle and nothing like it, stop name-dropping people. Fantomas is an amazing band in its own right. The music changes and swaps rapidly, stopping and starting, which makes it either something you will love or something you will hate. If it was to be compared to anything, i would compare it to Adult Themes with music backing. I love it,.. my family and girlfriend hate it... but who cares?"
2,"Mostly failed ""experiment""","I love Mike Patton. I love Bungle. I've bought all of his solo stuff. I don't think his music is maturing. This album is pretty much his solo stuff with music. Sounds promising, but alas for the most part disappointing. Fantomas is like going to see a performance art piece that is so incredibly internal for the artist that the audience is completely alienated. There are a few instances of Mike making some pretty damn cool sounds, but then it gets jumbled up by the instrumentalist's crappy old school thrash and ambient noise making. The people who will like this CD will be those who like to impress their friends with how ""crazy"" their music collection is, or if they're on the nod. At least it's better than Eye Yamatsuka. If you've never heard any of this stuff before, you should buy it to open up your brain to what Patton's creativity has to offer."
3,"Whoever referred to this as ""Dadaist"" hit the nail....","...on the head. At times, this album comes off as just a mockery of music; but ironically, the musicianship is ridiculously tight. Seemingly improvised nonsense, but it is quite the opposite upon realization that the vocals, drums, guitar, and somewhat inaudible bass (one downfall) all play in complete synchronicity despite the nonsensical rhythm patterns. This is heavily calculated anti-music, and as a result, is quite impressive.If you like this, pick up the EP that Mike Patton did with the Dillinger Escape Plan, ""Irony is a Dead Scene."" It's very similar, except Patton actually has lyrics for that disc, and the musicianship is (unbelieveably) at least 10 times tighter, more eccentric, and more electic. If you enjoy the Dillinger Escape Plan for their eccentricity, you will definitely enjoy this."
3,Fun tone mass or...,"...nothing really new :noise,silence,aggresion... to the end of CD.Voice,guitars,drums,bass are first rate don't understand me wrong! BUT where's the music my friends? Experiment again!"
5,An Amazing CD for those Who Enjoy Something...Different.,"Fantomas is genius. But, not everyone can enjoy hanging out with a genius, he can just be to hard to understand, to complicated for normal people. Fantomas is a tough sell just because they're not usual, people aren't used to listening to this kind of music. But, if you have an open mind, and want to enjoy something great and unique, definitely check out this CD. But if you don't like to have to REALLY think about what you're listening to, or just don't enjoy alot of loud noises, then please go somewhere else."
3,Fantomas,"I had great expectations of a new ""improved"" and heavier Faith No More,Unfortunately I can't help but be dissapointed,This group shows what it can do musically,and it almost teases you for the whole recording,Expect much John Zorn/Bungle experimentation without any recognizable melodies or songs.Patton basically grunts,screams and cackles his way though this,without one one recognizable lyric.One can only wish they had approached this recording with a little more seriousness."
2,Sketches of Id,"2 1/2I'm as big a fan of the schiz-rock as anyone, but the first release from Fantomas always seemed rather uninteresting to me. During this pounding 40 minute session of 30 primitive art-metal assaults, it almost seems like Patton and company are sketching aloud raw elements they would expand on in future releases. While there is a share of interestingly intense moments to be found, the whole Tasmanian-devil-on-drugs vibe becomes repetitiously indulgent."
3,Good idea,"This is a curious piece of ""music"". Unfortunately, the idea doesn't carry throughout the album. After 10 minutes it just becomes numbing. It never comes predictable, though. Recommended in small portions."
5,Great system,"After fiddling with the idea of a wired music system, and then abandoning it, followed by a short-lived experiment with the Roku Soundbridge, my client and I decided to go for the Sonos ZP system. It works perfectly. Sound reproduction at the wired player, as well as the wireless player downstairs is actually better than the sound through an iPod, thanks to the built in amplifier. The Roku Soundbridge, in comparison, actually sounds worse than the connected iPod, even when it is wired directly through Ethernet. Set up of the zone player system is easy, and smooth.While expensive, this system is worth the extra money. Highly recommended."
1,don't believe sales & customer service!,"Dave Z in sales told me that, in my business application and with the specific equipment that I had (receiver, ethernet set up and speakers), the Zoneplayer 90 would work great as the first and only product I would need. He was wrong. Our set up did not support the Zone Player 90 unless I purchased an additional Sonos product. At $360, this is expensive and as a business owner has been a time suck. What they promised was easy set up, was not as I contacted customer service 3 times and received apologies but zero solutions. This may work as a starting pack at home, but in a business this was a waste of time and money. I will instead purchase an Ipod which will work just great. I should have done that in the first place.They are all about the $ales and not about recommending appropriate solutions and solving specific set up issues."
3,works on and off,I like this item except it regularly stops transmitting the signal from the remote sensor for a period of time--usually several hours. Then it will start again. Perhaps it doesn't like to get cold!
1,Honeywell TE219ELW Weathertime Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer with Atomic Clock,I was initially satisfied but now it is essentially not working. FirstI lost the remote temp and now the main unit is do dim you can't read it.
1,short lived junk,"The outdoor unit consistently reads .3-1 degree higher than the indoor, even when they're standing next to each other.My unit's outdoor sensor stopped transmitting less than 24 hours after I turned it on and it hasn't worked since. I live in northeast Texas--hardly an extreme climate.It's been a week and the atomic clock still hasn't successfully connected once--not even when I stand in the front yard to get a clear signal.Also, the backlight/snooze button whines like a dying mosquito for a few seconds when activated.Besides those things, the alarm seems to work fine and the temperature measured is fairly accurate and consistent. The ice alarm is a neat idea: you can set it to wake you up early if the temperature is below freezing. I just don't have much use for it, living in Texas."
5,Weather Station,I bought one of these for myself and gave others as gifts. Works great no problems. Accurate and easy to use. The people who received these as gifts loved them. Even in extreme temps working fine. Use lithium batteries and follow directions and you should have a good experience.
2,I Wanted to Like It,"This unit has everything going for it, feature-wise. I bought it in defiance of some of the negative reviews it has received.After having used it for a couple/several months now, my report is: It started off fine. But after about a month, the indoor display unit lost contact with the outdoor sensor unit. Translation: Indoor temp displayed; Outdoor temp blank.So I followed the manual instructions and got the two units to reconnect. 10 days or so pass. Same deal. Then another week... Same deal.Am I going to have to manually reconnect these two units every two weeks for the life of the product? -- being, I would think, at least several years? The two units are only separated by about 25 feet. That doesn't seem reasonable, to me.It's too bad. So many other things are right about this product. But one of its core functions seems to be intermittent.I would send it back for a refund, but it's not worth the bother. I suggest you save yourself the expense and the bother."
2,A Honeywell(China) Disappointment,"The base unit seemed to work fine. Accessed atomic clock OK. I liked the display. The manual was OK. The remote seemed to read the correct temperature. However, the two did not communicate as specified. Sometimes they would if the remote was adjacent to the base. They would not, reliably, if they were inside and outside, respectively. Very disappointed. I thought Honeywell would qualify their products better. This function (wireless indoor/outdoor) is not a tough technical challenge. Returned product."
4,"So far, so good","I received this yesterday, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, and have had no problems. It is very accurate, and I really like the large display and back-light button for use at night. It has several functions I'm not interested in. I was also very pleased with the price and delivery speed."
2,Kept losing signal,"Set up must be followed according to manual or you won't get outside air temp to display. Unit frequently lost signal even though unit was only 30 feet from outside transmitter.this seems to be common problem with weather stations. You need to remove batteries, reinstall batteries with transmitter close by, to reset. Eventually I got tired of this and used my iphone app to show me outside air temp"
1,A big piece of junk!!! Save your money!,"I should have read the reviews BEFORE I bought this. It does not keep the remote temperature. The company does not stand behind their products, and will not give replacement or refund, so buy at your own risk. Also be careful of the companies that your buy items from on here. This one is not helpful at all and could not care that they sold me junk!"
3,Not very accurate,Outside temp always shows 5-6 degrees higher than the true outdoor reading. No way to adjust. I'm a little disappointed. My old Oregon Scientific was much more accurate.
1,Wireless temp,"When the indoor and outdoor units were sitting side by side they were about 2 degrees apart. I would have expected them to read the same. No adjustment to correct for this. Answer from Honeywell was Plus or minus 2 degrees is the specification. Sorry, I should have purchased a different unit."
2,Does not have feature I need,"I can't really give this a review as I have not use it . By the written description of the item I thought it had the feature I need - an adible alarm I could set to go off at a temperature I decide upon. Unfortunately it goes off at 32 degrees, I cannot change that. So , I was goign to send it back but after realizing I paid $6.00 shipping to receive it, would have to pay shipping to send it back and then the company charges a 15% restocking fee, well, it wasn't worth it. I will probably pass it along to someone at some point but it is useless to me."
4,Wonderful Instruction,"At last ... a DVD which makes it EASY to learn the moves by drilling them in an intelligent order. YAY! The drills are just right - not too fast, not too slow. Clear & to the point instructions ... no endless yakking. This DVD shines simply by avoiding the pitfalls which make so many dance DVDs annoying.I purchased Elisheva Pop & Lock as a companion DVD for Anasma's Liquid Fusion. Anasma is the superior artist, but her material is very advanced. Elisheva drills the material which was most difficult in Liquid Fusion. This DVD is advanced beginner - intermediate level. If you already know dance basics and want to learn ""modern fusion"" style, this DVD is perfect.Alas, I could only give 4 stars. Elisheva is a fantastic teacher, but if you want good choreography you have to buy Anasma's Liquid Fusion. If you can afford it, I recommend to purchase both. Drill with Eisheva but learn choreography from Anasma.Happy Dancing!"
1,not very good,"Tribal Fusion Pop & LockI expected better music, costumes, backgrounds and choreography. Was disappointed in all the above, I wasted my money on this one, but like the other 3 bellydance dvd's by other dancers that I bought."
3,Overpriced,"Way, way overpriced. You can get them at Costco for much less. If only I'd known...Otherwise, I mean, the drink's good..."
3,Good product way overpriced,"I drink at least 1 sugar free rockstar a day, but not for anywhere near this price. I purchased mine at CosCo for 28.99 for the same size of a case. That is less than half the price for those who don't like math :)"
5,"This Drink ""Rocks""","I used to be a Sugar Free Red bull addict. Once I had Diet Rock Star, I converted. The drink comes in a larger container than Red Bull, which is nice, but I also like the taste better. It is great on it's own as a pick me up, but is also great mixed with Midori or Grey Goose (and I am sure other various liquors). Plus, only 20 calories in the entire thing! I highly recommend it."
5,Beautiful,"Oh my, what a lovely book. Freke has pulled together a collection of spiritual writings and art organized into ten chapters. Each chapter includes, side by side, various religious writings dealing with such subjects as: The Supreme Being, The Self, and Fate and Free Will. If you are on a spiritual path uniquely your own, you will love this book. If you are a member a religion or tradition which believes that it alone is the path to 'salvation' or spiritual truth, then read this with an open heart and mind. It illustrates the fallacy and limitation of dogmatism and the beauty of the spiritual truth in all."
5,Second in the classic series,"I'm the archivist for the free Graphics Gems code base on the web. I do it for free, because this code is so valuable. Others think so, too: there are 100 hits a day on average at the site. Go look at the online list of what's in this volume to see if it's for you.Highlights in this volume (for me - everyone's favorites vary) include an implementation of Perlin's noise function, a guide to quaternions, some useful C macros for vector ops (wonderfully short and clever), and view correlation."
2,It's just entertainment.,"As a concerned parent, I do not want my 3 year-old and 15 month- old watching more than an hour of TV. When they do watch TV, I want it to be somewhat educational. ""The Best of Elmo"" is cute, fun, and fairly brief, however it does not teach enough. The Elmo's World DVD's are alot more informative, and I prefer them even if they are a little long. Worst of all my three-year old tries dancing on the stairs just like Elmo in the ""Happy Tapping"" segment. There are better Elmo DVD's than this."
3,Great Video - Terrible Audio!,"I am now on my third copy of this DVD - kudos to Amazon Customer Service for trying their best. The video itself is fantastic and my daughter loves it, but the audio is terrible! At times the audio is screechy, high-pitched and muffled. It is very annoying! I have over 70 DVDs in my collection and am running the audio through a $1,200 Denon receiver. I do not have this problem on any other DVD and it is not my equipment. Shame on the manufacturer for mastering a DVD with such poor sound quality - I think the letters of the day should be QA/QC!"
2,Dated and anoying,"This is obviously an old VHS transfered to DVD. It has none of the Elmo's World format, the talking directly to your child that kids find so engaging, or the wonderful Mr Noodle. Rather it is uninteresting story staring Elmo built to tie together a few very old musical numbers. For example, Elmo's rap number is just lame, like old-school in a bad way. And the sound quality throughout is pretty fuzzy. My kid was bored, and usually any Elmo makes her squeal with delight. I consider this purchase a miss."
2,"Sorry -- no thumbs up on this one, Elmo!","We have nearly one dozen ELMO DVD's for our toddlers; this is their Least favorite and by far my worst as well. Very above their heads as far as content, wherease the ELMO'S WORLD DVD's cater to little kids and their like and dislikes. The Noodle Brothers are a real favorite and they don't even make an appearance in this one! The singing and dancing is fine if you're looking for a ""Broadway"" show but for plain educational fun and games, this is not the one to buy...stick with any and all ELMO's WORLD tapes/dvd's."
3,Just OK,"While the segments are cute and touch on great topics like accepting people who are different, I have 2 complaints about this DVD:1. The run time. 30 minutes? Please. No DVD should be 30 minutes, especially when Sesame Street has such a large catalog to choose from. They could easily make these longer, but they want to make you buy more DVDs.2. Since this is a ""Best Of"" video, it relies heavily on celebrity guest appearances by people such as Julia Roberts and Whoopi Goldberg. One problem - little kids don't know who the celebrities are, so they're not impressed. The ""Best"" segments should be the ones that are the most fun and imaginative, not the ones where Elmo just sits there talking to someone that a kid could care less about."
1,"Great Material, HORRIBLE Audio","I've purchased this video three times: First on VHS, then again on VHS because my toddler wore it out. She absolutely loves it! Then, I bought it on DVD.What a mistake. The audio transfer is horrible--it's terribly distorted from start to finish. Even my tin-eared aunt said, ""What's wrong with the sound?"" I tried calling the toll-free number they have listed on the DVD packaging to see if they know anything about this. The ... person I spoke with said that my inquiry was a ""technical question"" and had nothing to do with a defective disk. I was shuffled off to another phone number that ultimately was a dead end.Evidently, quality control isn't much of an issue to Sony and Sesame Street, and it certainly takes a back seat to profit. So while the material on this video is great for toddlers and Elmo fans, stick with the VHS version."
3,not entertaining enough for a 1 year old,not enough music and colors for a 1 year old to be entertained.I do not recommend it for the ages of 1-2
4,The Best of Elmo,"My Grandson loves ELMO, and this was just perfect for him for Christmas!! This was a great price at Amazon."
5,One video for kids that I don't mind watching over and over,"With its catchy songs with clever lyrics, this is one DVD I actually enjoy watching with my kids. And since this DVD is my 18 month old's favorite, I watch it a lot! It is the best Sesame Street DVD I have found."
4,Cute video,"Its a cute video with Elmo songs and dances. I gave it a 4 star because it was pricey for only 35 minutes, and it could have been longer and it could have included other, even better songs. But, overall, our daughter really enjoys it."
2,This cant be Elmo at his best!,"Seeing the reviews on this site, I excitedly went out and purchased the Elmo DVD for my 2 year old daughter. First of all, what a disappointment! This DVD does not deserve the title of the Best of Elmo. Secondly, there are only a handful of songs (3 are cute/noteworthy, the others are not great). The DVD is only 30 minutes long and maybe 5 minutes of that is talking/storyline. Of the talking parts, 2 of the segments are totally uneducational and pointless (Whoopi and Julia). So I would say that only 10 minutes of this DVD is actually enjoyable. Despite this, I'm giving it 2 stars because my daughter actually sat through it, although because its only a half hour in length she makes me repeat it 3-4 times each time she watches it!"
3,Technically defecient,"The content is still great (see my review of the VHS version), but the execution is a bit weak.However, the sound on the DVD version is much worse than on the VHS version. It seems like they mastered it at too high an audio level when compressing to Dolby Digital and there are some compression atrifacts (clipping, distortion) obvious when the disc is played back at moderate to high volumes.Instant rewinding and the ability to skip the so-so skits makes up for it though..."
2,Outdated. go for Best of Elmo 2,"This is a dull production. baby hated it at first.Not funny, not educational, lame songs and no celebs. would have been a waste of money hadn't it gone to a nonprofit. I recommend getting Best of Elmo 2. that is truly a must."
5,Elmos Review,"I have watched the video with my 14th month old grandson, helikes it but for his age it is to long for him to sit still.So, what I have done is have him watch half one day and therest of it another day. That way it still hold his attention.He loves Elmo."
3,Just okay,"A mixture of Elmo skits, and in my opinion, not necessarily ""the Best"". To link the skits together, Elmo shows his drawings to Seasame friends with each picutre then leading to a skit. In the end all the pictures are gone & elmo has none to put in the Monster Art show. But Seasame friends learn of this and give him back his pictures. This disk is nothing like Elmo's World skits. But my 2yr old daughter does watch this, though it's not her favorite. It's not a bad one, but there are so many more Seasame & Elmo videos out there that I would pick over this one."
3,Disappointed...but still loving Elmo!,"All of the videos on theis DVD are quite old. There isn't a lot going on that keeps the attention of little ones. There is not much singing/music, either. It is an Elmo DVD, so my 20 month old son is still excited for it...but it does not keep his attention like many of his other DVDs.Sesame Street: The Best of Elmo 2is WAY better!"
5,elmo is great,"Any child that loves Elmo absolutely needs to get this video. I had this for my son when he was a child in 1995, and it was so great that I had to buy the DVD for my son last year. He loves it and so do I."
4,elmo all stars,"I have purchased this item for my granddaughter of 18 month. She loves it and watched it almost the whole day.Items purchased on Amazon are always perfect qualities and fast delivery. As a customer Iam completely stafisfied with the handeling and services. Iam most honoured to be a amazon customer, who has the biggest dvd collections in the world.RegardsH.Tjia"
1,Not a favorite....,"At my house- this one isn't a favorite. I think the story line is too long for a toddler. They like action and this one doesn't give it. My DD loves the babies, dogs and farms one. We watch that over and over again, but this one just sits. Sorry Elmo!"
5,GREAT!!!!!,THIS WAS MY FAVORETE ELMO MOVIE WHEN I WAS LITTLE!I WATCHED IT ALL THE TIME!IT`S VERY GOOD!I RECCOMEND IT FOR AGES 1-4 1/21!
3,"A little Slow, Best of Elmo 2 is Better","After reading the reviews for both Best of Elmo DVD's I decided to buy both, I figured the more variety the better. We LOVE Best of Elmo 2! It was upbeat, filled with amazing songs that my son Loved. He could sit there and watch the whole thing over and over. It's not just my son who loved that DVD, I did too! I love singing along to the songs with my son and dancing around the living room. This DVD Best of Elmo 1 was more of the older material but that wasn't a problem for us, the problem was it was just slow and boring for my little one. He lost interest after the first few minutes. I recommend Best of Elmo 2 to anyone who has an Elmo Lover in their house old no matter what the age!"
5,Short And Sweet,"Kids just love Elmo, no matter how much adults may not feel the same way, though I do admit I am somewhat entertained by him. But my son (2-1`/2) absolutely loves him, so that is what really matters. I try to limit television/video time and a one or two 1/2 hour breaks during the day and this is a good DVD for those times - you usually cannot go wrong with CTW."
4,my two year,my two years old enjoys this movie. she does however prefer the music one but she is definitely entertained and enjoys
2,The Best of Elmo,"Not exactly some of Elmo's best work. Parts of the animation that didn't include the characters scared my son. There could have been better scenes and choices to make it ""Elmo's Best."""
3,There's a better Sesame St in the old neighborhood...,After watching this one a few hundred more times....it grew on me enough to add a star...In a nutshell this DVD title holds a series of unimiginative chorus numbers. The usual layers of jingley toe tapping songs interwoven with a good story line are missing...what's left seems to be the bottom of the barrel of B sides...
3,As an Elmo fan I was a little disapointed,"My 13 month daughter loves Elmo, but not so much this video. He is still very cute but the images are a little too old."
2,Not ready for Elmp,Might be a good video...it just doesn't interest our 10 month old yet like Baby Einstein does.
4,Tape will zone out your child,"My 20 month old daughter loves watching this tape. She will bop along and participate in the parts of the face song. Her empathetic side came out when watching this when Telly and Elmo fell describing heavy and light. Otherwise, she loves the tape, therefore we love the tape."
5,The title says it all!,"A favorite video of my daughter since she was 10 months old. Now she's 16 months and she loves to dance and ""sing"" along. For maximum Elmo-exposure, he also leads the viewer from clip to clip. Sure to bring a smile to your Elmo-lover's face every time."
5,Movie is also a favorite of mine.,"I've been looking for the book since viewing the movie My Live So Far. I agree that there must be a reprinting to satisfy the renewed interest. If you haven't seen the movie, do."
5,Saw movie - looking for book,"Haven't read the book, but the movie was so good, I would think a renewed interest in the printed book would occur.The 5 star rating is for the movie....."
2,Does NOT last!!!,"We were very pleased with it first 2 months, however, the problems then began. First, the battery door broke.Minor repair we made. Second, we kept getting the ""no disc"" error. After working with it for several hours, I called Coby and was told the unit was defected. Needless to say, I was told there was nothing they could do about it although it was new. Told it only had 90 day warranty, so basically throw your defected unit away and purchase a new one. After researching, I have found several others have had this very same problem but the company was unwilling to address this frequent complaint! Save your money!"
1,Looks good but is flauty,Bought this last Christmas and it worked great for one plane trip. After that the screen would cut out after a couple of minutes.Now its useless.Good looking but poor quality.I would not recommend wasting your time on it.
4,Good Package (a little touchy though),"It came with two pairs of head phones and a mounting case to put on back of seat in car. That was a nice bonus. It is nice looking and doesn't feel cheap. If you are wanting to let your child hold it, it might not be the best. It is kind of sensitive. I would buy it again though. It is perfect for in the car and it comes with everything you need."
1,This is the worse electronic divice I have ever bought !!!,"I bought it on January 2, 2007 and it worked just for 30 days. I flied out the country with my family and we couldn't watch any movie - NO VIDEO ANYMORE. My daugther cried a lot because she could not watch the movie she wanted.After we came back and called for the warranty, we recivied a big surprise THE PRODUCT JUST HAVE 90 DAYS OF WARRANTY, so they could not respond us. So THE CONCLUSION IS THE COBY TF-DVD7050 7"" IS A DISPOSABLE PRODUCT AND YOU CAN NOT TRUST IN THAT COMPANY."
1,Broke after 6 DVD's/Coby not good at fixing,"I got this for XMAS as a gift and while it had a great picture, it seemed very loud when a DVD was played. It actually stopped working after playing only 6 DVD's. It was still under warranty so I sent it back to Coby -- I had to pay postage to get it back to Coby and send a Money Order for $18.50 so they could either send the repaired unit or a replacement back. It took 8 weeks before it was sent back and then Coby sent me a new one, but a different model -- the TF-DVD7307 -- not even a tablet-style player. At that point I decided to keep the ""wrong"" unit they sent me because it would just mean more postage to send it back and then more to get the correct one sent to me."
1,Piece Of Junk,I bought this player to use when traveling.I only used it a couple of times and the player died right after it went out of warranty.I will buy a name brand next time.
1,sadly disappointed,"This is the second Coby I have owned. I bought the first one a year ago. It lasted about 6 months and then died on me. It said wrong disc. I had the 2 year warranty and so I got another one. This last one didn't even last 1 month before it started saying wrong disc. I really like the dvd player when it is working. I am very sad that it quit. I am not sure which one I am going to get to replace it, but I sure hope it works longer then this one. If you do decide to buy this one definately get the 2 year replacement package!!"
4,Quirky....but good,"The price on this unit is great and I have to say the picture quality and the sound quality / volume is very good.My only complaints are: 1 - that the unit occassionally shuts down. This has only happened twice in 4 14hr trips. I will say this wreaks havoc with a 5yr old at 75mph lol. 2 - the case that the unit goes in that then velcros to a headrest is a bit cheaply made.What I will say is that there is ALOT included in the package. It has everything you need in one box. Headphones, power supplies, cassette adapter..all of it.Overall I would recommend the unit."
2,"Cute, but doesn't last","My 3 year old son received this as a gift for Christmas last year. I loved all the features, great sound, great picture, nice for trips to visit family two states away. The only thing I didn't like is that I had to take the player out of the case to change the disc. Would have been nice to have some way of rigging it so I didn't have to completely take it apart. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 6 months. Brand new DVDs started reporting ""Wrong disc"" after playing for only a few minutes. Now it constantly freezes up, or reads ""Wrong disc"" and won't play at all. Maybe it's just too sensitive and needs to spend all it's time indoors...not out on the highway? I will not buy Coby again after this."
2,Was good when it lasted,"I had this product for a few months before it started giving me the wrong disc error. It lasted me a few car trips as well as a trip across the united states and back via flying. Everything was going well until I left it sitting on my couch because I was watching it while I was sick. I think the unit heated up too much (as it does frequently, even if just sitting on a table) and something must have fried inside. I haven't been able to fix it at all and will definitely not be getting the same one. My opinion is that you invest $30 more and get something that will actually last you longer rather than taking a gamble with this unit."
2,don't purchase without the protection plan,"Loved it while it lasted. purchased it from amazon in July 06 ...people often commented on how cool it was...then for no reason the ""wrong disk error"" appeared. I did buy the protection plan and must say it was a pleasure. I reported the problem, packed up the dvd player and mailled it out( I did have to pay for shipping). I recieved a check for the purchase price a few short weeks later. I considered buying the player again but opted for a panasonic with the protection plan..."
1,Not a good Coby - wrong disk error,"This is our second Coby Portable Tablet DVD player. We chose Coby again because, 3 years later, the first player still works great. This one only lasted 89 days (being used 5 or 6 times) and then froze up with a ""wrong disk"" error. We tried everything to no avail. Coby's warranty is 90 days for this item and I have to foot the bill to return it to them and then shipping again for a new unit. I don't recommend this product, and as usual, you get what you pay for."
2,The optical lense is not heavy duty,"I had 2 of these, the first one i used a lot, but the optical lense worked for only six month, it burned.The second one, i bought the pair for this one, and these worked only for two month.Maybe is to easy for change, but the big problem is we don't have the parts in this country."
2,Broke after 1 year,"We purchased this for our son for a Christmas gift. After about one year, it doesn't work at all. We didn't even use it that much! We only took it out for longer trips. We spent the extra to get the dual screens so when we had another child, they'd both have a player for the seat in front of them. We never even got to use the second one. Waste of money."
1,Technical Problems,"The first one I got didn't start at all, and the replacement had a pixel error ... however, the design is great"
4,Great for traveling with kids,"We needed a portable DVD player for a cross-country trip with the kids. After some research we chose this Coby model. The picture is incredible for a little unit that is pretty inexpensive. Some reviews we read warned about the screen scratching easily, so we used a soft storage bag. Battery life is OK, gets you half way across the US, but if you have a layover, make sure you know where to look for outlets in the airports and you have time for the unit to charge, as it does not charge that quickly. Another great thing about the unit is that it comes with just about everything you need - except a good storage bag. So you're set in the car and at home. It also does come with headphones and there are 2 jacks. Note that once you plug in a headphone this cancels out external audio. It seems to be well built and does not weigh much. If you're not an A/V snob or have kids, highly recommend this."
3,good if you're planning on just original dvds,"hi,this product has good packaging like others mentioned. nice look and feel, decent picture, more than enough for keeping the kids at bay on long drives. I bought two units. after 100 days (that's right, 10 more than the warranty) one of the units stopped playing DVD-Rs (recorded DVDs). It still plays original DVDs, but if you want to make a backup so that both kids watch the same movie - don't hold count on that working for long. also, all this happened just a couple of weeks ago, i hope the unit doesn't deteriorate to the point it doesn't read DVDs at all.Bottom Line:Great bang for buck if your unit holds up."
1,not even one star... read on.,"This DVD player as really big problem or should I call it defect. Let me explain:For all the great reviews all the plus accessories all the hype this DVD as been getting, for all that it can get any worse that to have a DVD player that scratches the DVDs, after a day of viewing a movie it left a ring on the outer surface of the DVD, yes!! A well-rounded symmetrical ring. I returned it to Amazon and replace it and the second unit did the exact same thing. What's next you guess it... Refund.So for all of you who have purchase this Coby DVD player look very closely at the DVD you are playing and look very closely again before you put it back you might be surprise, although not pleasantly with what you find."
1,TOTAL junk,This product is a TOTAL junk. I purchased and had to return it the next day because the screen did not show any image. I made the mistake to change it for the same item. The replacement worked for a couple of months and then it is not reading DVDs....because Amazon is only responsible for 30 days now I have to waste my time and money calling the manufacturer...DO NOT buy this please.
1,Absolute rubbish,"As is the case with so many, we wanted to save money on a portable unit for the kids to watch while on extended road trips. I guess we've used it maybe ten times in about two years. Now all we get is a blue screen although the disk plays sound. Are we being too demanding to expect a DVD player to last longer? I've read other reviews where folks got zero help from the manufacturer so we'll not waste our time. This item is just typical of the modern manufacturing mentality of ""planned obsolescence"" where products are made only good enough to just barely slip through the warranted period and then fall apart, leaving the purchaser no choice but to buy another unit that won't last any longer... ad nauseam... ad infinitum. Save whatever you might have spent on this crappy Coby DVD player and buy books."
2,Like the idea but the item was cheap,"I had the wrong disc error that many people had. We ordered the item just before flying to New York, and had it shipped over night so our sons could watch movies on the plane. Well, the first one played with out a problem, then the next one started the errors. I had read this was possible and had other items to entertain the kids so it was no big deal. Really wish this one had worked because the batery powered player at this low cost would be great even if it only lasted a year... It did seem really well built."
1,great if it worked,"Great concept and would be a great value except I haven't been able to get it to last more than 3 weeks. The replacement for my first unit (lasted 2 weeks)just gave out after 3 weeks. It was used several hours a day, but I was careful with it, especially the 2nd one....maybe that is why it lasted an extra week?!! Very frustrating"
4,Decent for the Price,"I like the portable DVD player. I bought it for the car mostly for my three year olds entertainment.Like the look overall. Seems durable. Nice picture. Came with everything you need.The only downfall I can see is that if your using it for your car, the bag it comes with wasn't designed very well. You have to take the whole player out of the tight fitting bag in order to change the DVD. Kind of a pain, if you ask me. Make sure you put in a long running movie so you won't have to keep changing it.Not sure if I would purchase another one, just for the fact that I wanted it specifically for the car.Next time I might look for one that has a better bag design or buy a side loading DVD player."
2,"Coby TF-DVD7050 7"" TFT Portable Tablet-Style DVD Player","I like the tablet style is neat it's a cool looking portable dvd player but i had nothing but problems with it from the get go, it would flicker, just shut off for no reason ( yes, the battery was charged), it would also fowl up when you played an audio cd as well.poor quality."
1,Horrible - Do not buy,"We purchased this for my baby several months ago. I knew it was going to be troublesome from the start when a DVD that I had no prior issues with started skipping repeatedly on this player. Changed DVD's and that one started skipping, too. I really wanted one that could mount to the headrest since my son was rear facing, so, I just put up with it for the last several months on long car trips. He's just one, so it wasn't a big deal that the DVD would randomly start over or that it made a grinding noise at times that sounded like it might blow up at any minute. Of course, this would be an issue for an older child or adult trying to watch a movie. Now, however, the stupid thing won't charge. There is a short in it, I guess, so it is now useless. I'd read several good reviews, and a few bad ones. Upon coming back to leave this review, I couldn't help but notice that the last several reviews are negative. I guess it once was a good product, but it certainly isn't any longer."
1,No color after only a few uses.,I bought this less than one year ago and only used it about 5 times. It worked well until the color went out. I called COBY and they said that the screen went out and that they only cover it for 90 days. Since it had been more than 90 days they would not fix it even at my own cost. What a waste of money.
2,Not recommended,"As did most everyone, we bought two of these to keep our kids entertained on long car trips.They worked perfectly and without fail for the first trip. I agree that the headrest mounting bag that comes with it covers some important knobs and inhibits operation. Has to be removed to adjust almost anything other than volume.About midway through the second trip one of the players started gliching (like it was overheating or something), would just go black on screen and stop in the middle of a disc regularly. That irritated the kids more than if it hadn't fired up to start with. The second one started doing the same thing just before the end of trip 2. We tried to take them on trip 3 and they wouldn't last more than 5-10 minutes at a time. All this and they were about 2 weeks past the replacement plan date. They are in the garbage dump if you really want one.Thumbs down Coby!"
5,you won't regret,"The device is perfect for the travellers, for use in the car and my child love'es it. The screen is nice but to bad that supporting bag is not planned to access the buttons..Overall great product for small money..."
3,One works and one doesn't,"We bought two of these in June to keep our kids occupied during a road trip we took. One of the players still works fine but the other one is totally messed up. It doesn't display a picture on the screen...we tried to hook it up to the TV in our room and just use it as a spare, but it says ""wrong disc"" when you try to play anything in it (the disc we used works fine in other DVD players). These only come with a 90-day warranty, which sucks because if you spend your hard-earned money on something like this you expect it to last for a while...at least a year! The other one works fine (for now)...good picture, good sound, etc. Just be warned that these aren't the greatest in the world...you'd probably be better off spending a little more for something that will last."
3,Decent For The Car...But...,"I bought this about 5 months ago to entertain my infant son on long car rides. It does a pretty good job...but not great. The unit has frozen on me a few times, thankfully we only use it on long family trips though, so I'm able to climb in the back seat to reset it.The picture is bright and crisp, and the sound is great. It's a little cumbersome to change out the CD's because of the headrest holder, so I try to put long running disc's in (or I just replay them, my son's too young to know the difference).If you're looking to use this for anything more then occasional entertainment, or have older children that will be watching movies, I would recommend maybe looking around for something else. While the screen size and picture clarity is wonderful, it does freeze up more often then I'd like...and that's with extremely gentle use. I really don't see this holding up too well for someone who uses it more frequently. Either way...good luck with it!"
2,"Started out ok, then both units became complete junk!","We bought this and initially loved it. Then a few months passed and we discovered what a piece of junk it was. Sure it comes with a lot of great stuff and it's well priced, but you get what you pay for with this player. We bought the replacement plan and I guess it's good we did because after a few months when the first one wouldn't play anymore, we sent it back and received another one. This one pooped out in a different way, but led to the same result--no longer usable. We had to pay for the shipping to send in the player and we had to re-buy the player from amazon and then be reimbursed. So I suppose we got our moneys worth (?), but now a year or so later and $100 plus the warranty later, we are back where we started--no portable DVD player. Buy at your own risk and don't trust a review from someone who has had it a couple of days. We'll definitely be buying something different this time around."
1,Two Defective Units!,"I wonder if these players were good in 2005, but now they're just plain old and don't work anymore. This is 2008! I ordered one and it arrived defective -- no audio. The picture was fine, but no sound anywhere. I ordered a new one and this one had no picture! Unbelievable! Needless to say, I will not be ordering another replacement for this one, I'm finding a different model and brand. Too much work on my part for junky products."
1,Zero Stars - Dead after 15 minutes,Tested it out when I got it and it worked great. Fast forward three weeks. Tried to use it on my family vacation - 'wrong disk' errors. If you are foolish enough to buy this make sure you get the replacement plan (you have to wait 90 days until it kicks in though). Like me I'm sure you will just wait the time and get your money back (minus the cost of the replacement plan of course).
4,Great DVD Player.,Works great.Very nice picture.The sound is also great and goes loud.The pictures seemed to make it look smaller than what it is.I took it out of the box and WOW!I wanted to make sure it was going to work.So I watched all three extended versions of Lord of the Rings and it worked wonderfuly.I'm glad I bought this dvd player.Good job Coby.
1,Thank goodness Amazon has a good return policy,"My decision to purchase this item was based on the positive reviews on Amazon. Thankfully, it quit working within the allotted return time. Easy to return. Unfortunately, the next one broke as well. Luckily, again within the time requirements. Definitely the worst gift purchase ever."
2,only worked 8 times and died,"after 8 disc it doesn't read any more only says disc error, I have made a mistake buying this dvd player."
2,It worked for 40 days (Wrong Disc error). Warranty coverage is close to useless.,"It worked for 40 days, then got the ""Wrong Disc"" error. Warranty coverage is close to useless.Within warranty period: it takes 4-6 weeks, plus you have to send money order for USD$12 in addition to paying for sending it back. If you add what it costs to get the item serviced under warranty (~USD@20) it is 20% or so what you paid for it. That seems pretty high not to mention you have to wait a long time.Overall, it worked fine for 40days, then even though it is ""covered"" by warranty, it is too expensive to get it serviced. It is now garbage."
1,Not worth the low price,"Purchased this unit from Amazon just prior to Christmas. It crapped out end of March (just after the 90 warranty, of course). Now fails to recognize any DVDs.Coby support has been wholly unsympathetic. They indicated they used to make exceptions to the 90 day warranty, but this exercise was discontinued (can't imagine it was because the products were so good). I couldn't understand how a company won't stand behind a product longer then 3 measily months.I also purchased a Coby Digital picture frame for a Christmas present. It came out of the box with a black line right thru the screen. Amazon refunded me for this, not Coby.All-in-all, 0 for 2 for Coby products this holiday season.Here's the advice, spend the extra $50 or so and get quality."
1,CHEAP PLAYER. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS.. 48 PEOLE GIVE IT 1 STAR...THEY ARE THE ONES THAT WAITED MORE THAN A DAY TO WRITE THE REVIEW .... AFTER 1 MONTH IT WILL NOT READ ANY DVDS. YOU PAY THE $18 S&H AND THEY SEND A REFURB OF A CHEAPER MODEL, WHICH HAS NO WARRANTY AND BREAKS AS WELL SO YOU ARE OUT $130 AND HAVE WASTED TIME TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE IDIOTS AT COBY CUSTOMER SERVICE. READ THE OTHER REVIEWS...."
4,Excellent quality for price,"I researched for a very long time for tablet-style dvd players and these are the best priced ones I could find. They are excellent quality and I haven't had any problems with them. They came with headphones, although uncomfortable ones, which I wasn't expecting. I love that this attaches to the headrest and I use it almost everyday for my 2 year old. My only complaint, is that there isn't any way to turn off the dvd player and have it start where you left off. You either have to leave it on, which runs down the battery, or just turn it off and start your movie all over when you get back in. But overall, this is an excellent product!"
5,Incredible value--I was impressed (and surprised),"I would have normally not purchased a Coby DVD player as I've stuck with brands I've used before (I love my Panasonic, but it was MUCH more expensive). For a road trip I wanted separate DVD players for my kids and these were great. In addition to being able to watch movies in the car, you can also use the portable stand and use throughout the house.The image was impressive and for what was included (2 headphones, car jack, headrest case, remote and RCA connectors), this is an incredible bargain.For $106.99, no sales tax, and no shipping fee for Amazon Prime, you cannot go wrong."
4,DVD player review,"I recently bought this DVD player for our 18-month old who was getting restless on car trips and with traffic in L.A. being the way it is, driving with him was becoming a headache. He now watches his DVD's in the car and we also take the DVD player with us into some of the more casual restaurants and place it right on the table so we can enjoy eating out more often. The picture is very clear and I have no complaints with the player. The player comes with its own car headrest holder and it has its own built-in speakers so the baby can watch without headphones. I would recommend it to other new parents who need some form of entertainment in the car."
5,Great for travelling with kids,"I purchased this portable DVD player, because it not only hangs off the back of your car headrest, but it comes with a slide in leather protection case that makes the process wxtremely quick and easy. It is also great on a plane, because the two headphone jacks allow two people to listen to a movie (2 headphones included), and the since it is a standup unit not a fold up unit, if the person in front of you puts their seatback, it will not affect you at all (when I use my laptop or old portable the screen would be partially closed). This is overall a fantastic unit, and comes with everything you need in one box. Do not settle for the cheaper $69 dollar ones at the grocery store, you will regret it."
3,It was not what I expected,It does not have a complete set of controls like the buttom to return to the main menu. It is very hard to keep the tablet style DVD player in a safe stand position
3,"Good value, but high probability of breakage","I bought two of these units in March. The kids love them, and the accessory package is particularly good value, with extras like a earphone-jack-to-cassette adapter (use it with your iPod).As you can see from the comments, these aren't particularly durable and reliable: one of ours just broke (screen permanently off). My suggestion is to buy this unit with the 2-year replacement plan. Even with that extra cost you have good value plus peace of mind.A final comment: as others have noted, the design of the car seat harness is not great, it tends to cover the buttons and I had to fasten mine around the bars that connect the headrest to the seat (if you try to fasten it directly to the headrest in a Toyota Sienna, the clasps will hit you in the head)."
1,It's good when it works,"I bought this for the tablet design. It worked for a while but then the skipping and pixilization started. The video and audio would become choppy and skip. I tested multiple dvds, and it is always plugged it to the vehicle's power. I emailed COBY several times but they have not been responsive."
4,great timing no problems at all,"pefect timing, product brand new, you get what you pay, all involved, 5 stars"
1,My second experience,"This is my second portable dvd player, so I have some experience with them. Today, it is the first day I turned it on and I have to say that quality sound is very poor. I am going to buy external speakers to improve the sound. Screen resolution is good."
1,bad experience,"Well I received this DVD player and after2 movies it doesn't work correctly anymore: blank screen and then pixels errors and freeze. I'm very disappointed because I had read all the review and even if there was some trouble the average was correct...bad luck. Nevertheless, I'd like how the player came with a full set of accessories ( 2 headsets, lighter plug etc..) owww I forgot: the service customer service seems to be very bad because I sent an email 12h ago and nothing yet !!! I think I will return it and tried a new one."
4,Just like they said...,"For the money, this is a great buy!Pros: The description doesn't list all the accessories like: 2 sets of headphones w/2 headphone jacks in the side, remote, mounting bag, cables to connect to tv, cassette adapter, lighter and power plug. The outside of the player seems rubbery like it could take a fall off a table and not break instantly. Nice picture, easy to use and it played our DVD+R's & CD's.Cons: The battery only lasts around 3 hours. That is not enough for our 5 hour flight to California but I bought 2 and switched to the other. Luckily my kids would share. Also, I found the same model in a mall in California for $79...I almost bought another one! Another small dissapointment is that you can't hook them together to show one movie on two screens.Very happy with the first 2 weeks!"
1,"Cheap product doest not last, waste of money","I was amazed with the accessories that accompanied with its price. I also bought this dvd player as it plays most of the formats apart from DVD. It has got a good picture and sound quality which i liked. I also bought a second piece for one of my friends considering the price and the output.Both worked for few months and all of a sudden both stopped working. Coby has proved that they sell cheap stuffs which never last. I would never ever buy any product from coby. Buyers, I would say that do not get misled by the good reviews. This is not a wise buy and you will end up paying more by buying another one soon. This DVD player will die quickly. I will buy a branded one and will never go for cheap ones."
2,Worked well but didn't last long,It was the best deal when we bought it in summer 2006. Used only for trips for my 10 year old daughter. Broke before its one year anniversary. Error message: Wrong Disk.
5,Damn good dvd player!!,"I have been using my player now for a month. It is a really good player, picture is great is easy to use. I would buy it again and again.. The only small con: is the speakers are not real loud. Enjoy! Larry MS."
1,bad item do not buy,I purchased this item last year for my grandson. It worked good for a few weeks and then stopped working. I returned it and received a replacement. The same thing happened. Now I am not able to return it. Beware.
2,Stay Away From Coby!,"Although it feels like it's build quality is good, it really isn't. I've had two of these players over the past 1 1/2 years. I used them at home for my child (usually playing out to a TV) and when we're on the road (a few times a year). Both broke down in a similar fashion, the controls became inoperable. Of course the warranty (90 days) had expired. Again, although this item feels like it's solidly built it always craps out. The only reason I purchased this twice was I figured the first was a fluke and it really is inexpensive compared to the others out there. I guess you could look at it as an item that needs to be repurchased every 6 to 10 months. What a shame. Perhaps it's worth spending the extra dollars for a better made item."
1,PIECE OF JUNK - Not the first one from Coby,"I bought a different tablet style Coby machine. It worked for a while, then stopped working. I called Coby and even though it was outside of warranty, they allowed me to get a money order for a replacement and ship it back to them at my cost. They sent me this TF-DVD7050. I have never had the chance to use it - it shows a ""Wrong Disc"" message for every disc I have tried. Really, believe the other low-rating reviewers. I can't believe I would get a dud (by chance) twice unless there are that many duds. Buyer beware!"
2,Worked for 6 months,"It worked great for 6 months (length of it's warranty), we used it almost everyday in the car. After 6 months it totally crapped out on us. First the buttons stopped working then the color and sound went out. Save your money buy a brand that will last longer."
2,Disappointed....,"We bought this product for our toddler and about 5 months later it quit reading the DVD's. Have tried cleaning the device and using various DVD's, but nothing is working. I am very disappointed in the quality of something that breaks after only 5-6 months of use...."
3,Ok for the price..I guess,"I purchased this dvd player since it was one of the only ones that come in a tablet format. it is very uncomfortable to change the dvd's since you have to take it out of the carrying case. The one that i got did not want to turn on so i returned it and i received another one from amazon within 2 days. it works fine just sometimes if you press too many buttons at once it will freeze and the screen will go white and you have to turn it off then on again. the movies take really long to load. other than that the screen looks great and the sound is great specially driving in the freeway. i thought it would be a much better quality than what it is. It looks like if you drop it, even on a carpet it will stop working. Its ok for the money. if you want something that is going to last a long time, look somewhere else. Hope this helped"
1,Just worked for 30 Days!!!,"Hi, at the beginning the DVD worked fine, I really used it like twice a week in the car to entertain my son, after 20 days it started malfunctioning sending a wrong disk error occasionally, after a month suddenly it stop playing any DVD at all. I wrote an e-mail to the manufacturer and until now I haven't received any answer, I tried to return it to Amazon but since the 30 days return policy has expired I can't. I tried to return it knowing that a discount will be applied because it's after 30 days... and I can't. So, you can be paying a $100 bucks for a one month DVD player. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL THIS ITEM."
4,Great value for the $!,"I was a but concerned over a couple of the reviews regarding battery malfunctions, but this player turned out to be terrific. I've had zero issues and the battery charge lasts long enough to complete a movie (or two, depending on length). I also didn't expect to get as many accessories for the price paid. Altogether a great value.Here is a tip. Because this is a tablet style, you need to take care to not scratch the screen. Either get a felt type drawstring bag to store the player in, or turn it BACKWARDS in the viewing case to protest your screen quality."
1,"Watch out, junk, horrible customer service","Watch out for these guys. I had one of these for a little over 4 months (3 month warranty). Just up and died. E-mailed the Coby and they basically said ""tough luck, why not buy our newer model."" Did a web search and found many other users with same problems."
2,Works AWESOME for a few weeks.,"I purchased this unit for my daughter to use in the car on trips. She watches Elmo, SpongeBob, and the Muppets, and she's happy. After two or three weeks, I no longer had a happy camper in the back seat. The picture went out of phase, discs wouldn't load, total disappointment. I called the vendor and was referred to Coby. Getting in touch with Coby has, so far, been an exercise in futility. If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it."
2,Won't last the 2 year warranty,"I have purchased 2 of these DVD players. The first time I bought one, it lasted about a year then the remote quite working, even after I replaced the batteries, then a week later the player just wouldn't turn on anymore. I wasn't rough with it, only used it at home. I got my money back. I figured it was probably a bad DVD player, so I went and purchased another. It lasted a couple months longer than the last one and it did exactly the same thing when it broke down. I don't understand why these DVD players quit like that, but they just don't last. If you buy one, get it with the 2 year warranty so you can get your money back when it breaks down, because it will."
4,Great for the first few days...,"I bought this product based upon the good reviews it got. I really loved it as I have a small car and can't use the flip screen DVD players because my 1 year old son can reach them and push the buttons. I loved how easy it was to use, with the remote as well. However, after 3 times of use I noticed it wasn't keeping my son entertained (which was not normal) and when I took a look at it, the screen was blank. Even though the DVD was playing and you could hear it there was nothing displayed on the screen. It was black. I tried exchanging it for another because I really did like it but Amazon didn't have it in stock so they will issue me a refund. In the meantime I have purchased the Sony FX-930 so I will be able to post a review soon for it."
1,Poor Quality,"We purchased this last year for our son to use on long trips. He's used it a total of 6 times since he received it, and the last time he tried to use it something started overheating and the player locked up. I don't know what is shorting out and I shouldn't have to dig around in a DVD player to find out what's wrong with it. Very disappointing quality, the warranty is poor, and I can't honestly recommend this to anyone I know due to these shortcomings."
1,Works fine....for a little while,"We purchased this item in May 08. A couple of weeks ago (March 09), the screen stopped working. The audio still works but the screen just shows white with a few lines and flashes. It worked fine up until then. Didn't even last a year before it stopped working."
