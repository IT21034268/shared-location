5,Uh Huh! What they said!,"Just like everybody else, I have loved this movie for years and years. Clint outdid himself here. Josey Wales is hardest, meanest, most cold-bloodiest good-guy to ever trod the western film world. I will continue to watch this movie over and over, now that I have it on DVD. Far and away my favorite movie."
3,DVD better than letter(box),"One of my favorite movies (5 stars). I have the regular DVD, and the output is just as good as HD cable. I ordered the blu-ray, and the film is in letterbox. With the smaller picture, I can't even tell if the picture is of higher quality. That's just a waste of my 50"" Panasonic."
4,Replace the vhs,I am glad to see the older movies coming out on dvd now. I have this on tape but didn't want it to wear out. It is a decent movie of Clints. For those who have his collection this is a good way to go.
3,Clint's directional debut,"Clint Eastwood directed this & it is pretty good, this is said to be his best western, In this he is Josey Whales, an ordinary guy who becomes an outlaw after his family is murdered, taking justice in his own hands, he sets out for revenge, almost like a western Dirty Harry, along the way he encounters many characters who join him on his quest, Sondra Locke(Eastwood's girlfriend at the time) makes her debut, this was Eastwood's last western until 1985's Pale Rider, & then 1992's Unforgiven, which in a way play out like sequels, Eastwood directed them too, & one has to wonder if he was playing the same character, if you watch all three back-to-back, there are parallels somewhat, of the three, this one is the best."
3,Josey wales,"The movie I liked very much,one of the best he ever made.This is the first product that I've received through Amazon which was subpar. Not the movie ;but the DVD was so very dark that no matter what was done it was extremely dark."
5,One of the best westerns ever,"This western has it all. After the first 10 minutes of the film, you too will want to mount up and avenge Wales against the heartless Redlegs. This movie is with suspense, action and nicely timed comedy not to mention too many one-liners to count (""dyin' ain't much of a livin' boy""). I love this movie. Even though I own a copy, it is still one of the few movies that if I'm channel surfing and happen across it... it stays on for the duration, any channel, any time."
4,A Very Nice Surprise,"This was one of those movies I added to my cart just to meet the 25-dollar limit so I could get free shipping. I've never been a huge Clint Eastwood fan, at least as far his directing is concerned. Certainly not a bad filmmaker, but nothing truly exceptional in my view. This movie however, was quite a surprise! I don't know exactly why I like it so much, but I can honestly say I was caught off guard. It has the darkness and grit of ""Unforgiven"", but still maintains the charm and sweetness of the old classics like ""The Searchers"" and ""Rio Bravo"". I don't generally do ""blind-buys"" of movies, but this was definitely one that didn't disappoint."
5,Our favorite Eastwood film.,Always worth watching again. Feel it is one of the best films that Clint Eastwood made. Often recommend to friends.
5,Arguably the best,"I'm the kind of guy that can (and has) had conversations with people about the best movies ever made in certain genres. Any time the discussion moves to westerns, most people I have had this discussion with agree, this is one of, if not the absolute best western ever made. There are lots of classics, and lots of great choices for that title, but even if this movie is not your choice for #1, it's probably in the top 5. Terrific characters, terrific cast, great story. The only weak spot is Sandra Locke, although this is one of her better performances. Unfortunately, that's not saying much IMO. All in all, a classic, and a great movie, even if you don't normally like westerns."
4,Excellent movie,"One of the best Old West movies Clint ever did. Can't really call it a cowboy movie, but great just the same."
5,DVD Movie,"Product received in good condition and as scheduled. I had seen this movie on regular tv, liked it and decided to buy/own a copy."
4,Classic Eastwood,"Eastwood is back yet again with another western. This movie is a good oldie. Eastwood actually plays a character with a real name in this one, the Outlaw Josey Wales. Saw this on AMC and had tot own my own copy to add to my Eastwood collection. If you enjoy ole style westerns from Clint then you will want to add this to your collection too."
4,Outlaw Josey Wales,Have always loved the movie and am pleased to have it in DVD format for viewing at any time!
2,Not a western fan,"Clint is good, there are interesting characters but the pacing is slow, I don't like westerns, could do without some of the cussing. If you like old shootem ups, then this might be for you."
2,Perfect for Uncritcal Eastwood Fans,"Overlong, poorly acted, cliche-ridden shot-em-up with pretentions to seriousness and post Civil War relevance. Nice job by John Vernon as Fletcher and the usualexciting suspend-your-disbelief Eastwood-style armed confrontations."
2,Another overrated Clint movie...,"This is another Clint movie that is too slow, too long, and isn't nearly as deep as many people have come to believe. Clint's strength isn't direction, contrary to certain opinions. This story could have been told in less than 2 hours, but it dragged on way too long. Chief Dan George is the sole redeeming factor for TOJW. HIS performance makes this movie worth watching now and again, but as a whole, this movie is only worth 1 viewing. By the way, Philip Kaufman(sp?) started out directing this movie, until Clint decided he wasn't cutting it, and literally took control. From that moment forward, Hollywood adopted 'The Eastwood Director Rule', specifically: ""That no member of the set or crew may replace a director once that director has already been put in place"". Kaufman never regained his footing in Hollywood again."
2,STRICTLY FOR BEGINNERS ONLY,"This is not for intermediate or advanced developers. Even if you're only a VB beginner but have coded in VC++ or some other language, you may find this very tedious as I did.Here's an excerpt from page 104: ------------------------------------------------- Select Case Err.Number""...we're telling the Select Case statement to work with the Number property of the Err object. That's where our program goes to look to find out the number of the error that we need to handle.""-------------------------------------------------The dialog between instructor and students is just too tedious for me. I could have bought an intermediate VB book which has one or two chapters on Objects. Based on reading the first 100 pages, I'd say the entire material could have been covered in 1/4 the space."
4,Learn to Program Visual Basic Objects,"This book should be the 3rd or 4th book in a series of books from John Smiley. Start with the ""Learn to Program Visual Basic 6"" and then follow it up with either ""Learn to Program Visual Basic 6.0 Examples"" or the ""Learn to Program Visual Basic Databases and finally this book. After you have read all 4 books, you will have a solid foundation to building more sophisticated applications. These 4 books by John Smiley help me get a solid knowledge base."
2,"I couldn't finish Moby Dick, either...","Anyone who has tried it knows that that book is wordy- and so is this one. The author uses a fictional programming class to set the stage for what he is trying to teach- with fictional students, and lots of fictional dialogue, as well. This results in a very LONG read for little information. I just couldn't get through it, a shame, because the guy probably knows what he is talking about.I prefer a text that you can get the information without trudging through lots of extra garbage. Smiley's style of writing is not for me. 2 stars is generous."
1,Caveat Emptor,"Please be careful with this DVD. For one, it is a DVD-R, not a silver ""pressed"" DVD. I had trouble playing it, and it only worked in the 3rd player I tried.Secondly, the movie is widescreen but is letterboxed in a 4:3 frame (i.e. not anamorphic) meaning that the movie only uses about half the available DVD resolution.The company concerned is ""Filmhouse"" who must presumably be a back-room type of setup."
4,"Retired ""Woodworker""","Thanks so much for your woodworking patterns. This retirement thing looked awfully boring till a friend of mine suggested I try woodworking. Your book has helped me fill a lot of empty hours, and I'm a lot happier too."
5,One of the VERY BEST,"First let me say I found the Patrick McManus stories funny each month as I got that magazine. Maybe it was Outdoor Life,,,,,Then I read there that I could get books full of his stories.WOW, I bought all of them.I must say though that I like this one best.BTW, If you ever read a story by Pat about being lost in the woods by all means believe him. I am way up here in NW lower Michigan.A man I know who is a regular fisherman was fishing a local river. He was away from any road when he happened to find a man that had been fishing, but was asking how to get out of there back to a road. After he had told the guy to just follow the river that way for about two more miles the guy introduced himself,,, Guess who? Patrick McManus of course. 8>))"
4,a fun trip,Patrick McManus continues to write humorous tales of his follies into the manly arts of hunting and fishing. An easy read that just might make you laugh out loud.
5,Don't listen to this while driving!,"Patrick McManus' is in fine form in this wonderful collection of stories. The audiobook, narrated by the amazing George Irving, brings out the hilarity of the McManus stories even more. The only downside to these is that you shouldn't listen to them while you're driving. I almost ran off the road with one story, I was laughing so hard!"
5,Best resource for headache sufferers.,Have used this book for years and sent numerous copies to others with headaches. It defines the different types of headaches and lists the common treatments. I used this book to help understand my problem with migraines. It is an excellent source for questions to discuss with physicians about headaches because most of them do not understand the different types or the possible treatments. I rate this an excellent source to help understand headaches
5,"""FREEDOM FROM HEADACHES -- AT LONG LAST!""","After suffering from migraine headaches for many years, not realizing the cause, my husband happened to see this book in our hometown pharmacy and bought it for me to read. I thank God that he did. This book is wonderful!!! I have not had another migraine headache since 1992."
2,DONT BELIEVE THE HIP IN HERE!!,"cant believe u guys gives this movie 4 to 5 stars ...If u are 13 and under,Then u would love this movie!...very childish Halloween movie, NOT scare or suspense nor nothing, With cheesy special effects, I grew up in 80s..And most movies back then had real good scrip and scare and special effects. This one is very cheesy funny/lame movie. I never seen this movie back in 80s,till now,And really glad i didn't!! ..Skip this crap, u would disappointed, don't believe these people reviews!"
4,Movie format display is windowboxed,"Good movie, but something is wrong with the display. The picture is windowboxed (black bars on all sides of the picture). To resolve this problem, I had to go into the settings on my TV and change the display from wide normal to zoom. I have to remember to change the TV settings back when finished watching the movie or everything else viewed on my TV will be affected. I hope this information helps with anyone else who is seeing a small picture with black bars on the top, bottom and sides."
3,Lady In White,"Mostly a story of a 10-11 yr old boy who gets locked in a closet at school by 2 bullies and comes in contact with the ghost of a murdered girl. After that the boy searches to find the girls killer. Great film early, but gets a little far fetched, confusing, and dragged out towards the end."
3,"Great Movie, but I received a DUD DVD","I love this movie and have since I was a kid; I got it for my teenage girls to watch and enjoy, howevever, about 20 minutes into the movie, the DVD went bad. We have tried several different DVD players, and to no avail. I got a bum DVD and have not had the time to return it, so PLEASE make sure your seller has an excellent rating before purchasing this! Don't remember the seller name, but now I have to buy another one; hope it comes out better this time."
4,Finally found it!,"Many years ago I rented this movie and liked the story. After trying to finding it again at the movie rental store I found it here on Amazon.com! If you consider that it was made in the 80's the story is still good w/ some bad acting, but I still enjoy watching it. If you want to watch a ghost story that won't give you nightmares then this is the movie for you."
4,Nostalgic Thrills,"This 1980's genre suspense film has both a nostalgic and whimsical feel. It is set in 1960s small town America.A 10 year old boy witnesses a horrific murder of a little girl whose ghost enlists his help in finding her mother.The problem is that the actual murder occurred ten years prior to his seeing it, and the killings are still happening in his home town.Although this film is considered to be a horror story, it is actually about relationships and family."
5,scary but awesome,"This is one of my favorite movies and now that I own it, it is also my two daughters favorite scary movie."
1,Poor quality,The Lady in White was very poor quality. Half the movie looked as if it was fast forwarded. Everything moving and talking really fast. I was very disappointed.
3,"Good, but not that scary","I had read many reviews about this movie, that it was the scariest movie ever made, and I had heard the same thing from friends. So I rented it. I watched it. I liked the movie. I liked it because it was a good ghost story, and it had good actors in it, and it had a good plot. It also reminded me of ""Poltergiest"", and it had a kind of a Speilberg touch. It just wasn't that scary. It gave you chills, though. Good to watch on halloween! NOT FOR KIDS. Images of a child in danger might scare them and give them nightmares."
4,A Gem,"Every once and a while you find a little film that never got much mention and you fall in love with it. This is one of those films. There is a great sense of nostelgia in this film which adds to its charm. Writer/Director LaLoggia put a lot of his heart into this very personal film. This turned out to be his masterpiece and it was a shame he did not stay in the film business with his talent (he made only 3 or 4 films total in his career, this was his second film). Here is a great mix of drama, suspence, mystery, and horror. It's kind of a ghost story and kind of a coming of age story. Looking at it now years after first seeing I still get a tear in the eye and lump in the throat, and I still get exhilerated by a couple classic horror scenes. Do youself a favour and see this film"
3,Great Story Line,"The movie is well-written with a host of famous actors. The editing is not the best, but the movie is well worth watching. If you are critical of movies such as saying, ""Why did he go that far when the shop was across the street?"" Or if you are LOOKING for 'bloopers', then I wouldn't recommend purchasing this movie."
5,lady in whit,This movie has lots of little things to overlook but it is my favorite ghost story movie. My kids and I watched it all clustered up on the sofa. The actores are very good in their parts. the special effects aren't great but I really like this one. not too scary not too violent. Just really suspenseful and errie.
2,"I give ""Lady in White"" one thumb up and one thumb down.","Lady in White was not bad, but good. The movie started off well. At the very end, though, it dragged. The ending didn't seem right for the movie. For me, it didn't make sense. But its to each's own oppinion, right? You can tell that this movie was a low budget film once you see the ending. That was the only thing that I disliked about the movie. Other than that, it was an okay movie."
2,lady in white,"Not that attention-holding.Plot seemed to drag on too long before coming together,as best it could.Realism just never made it. Disappointing."
1,Clueless as to why this movie got great reviews,"I like scary movies. This one had a lot of great reviews, so I got the DVD. Sadly, this turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Awful special effects. Stupid storyline. Bad humor. Ridulous. Maybe, MAYBE, kids MIGHT like it. Not a movie for adults, that is for sure. Please explain which parts are supposed to be ""thrilling"" and which parts are supposed to be ""scary"" and which parts will ""keep me on the edge of my seat"". Sorry to say, this movie is a dud."
1,How can anybody give this movie 5 stars?,"I purchased this movie based on the amount of 5 star reviews it got. I couldn't wait to watch it. And then I watched it. I'm still wondering, nearly a day later, how in the world this movie has so many 5 star reviews. This movie had no suspense and no scary parts what so ever. There were a few funny parts. I am now angry that I wasted not only my money, but my time as well on this movie."
5,Freaky,This is one of the creepiest shows ever made and yet noone has heard of it. BUY IT--you will not be disappointed.
3,Tonysoprano's movie review,"Well to sum it up the movie could have been better. I think the script was well written by Frank LaLoggia, but poorly acted out by the actors. And of course I higher budget for the film wouldn't have hurt either. Poor special affects took away from some of the chilly and scary moments in the film. With better actors playing Luke Haas's brother and his, plus a slightly bigger budget the film would have been much better. The scarest scene in the film is when Haas is with the killer alone out in the woods(the killer is a close friend of the family)and the killer starts to figure out that Haas knows he commiteted the murders."
3,Skip Director's Commentary on DVD,"If you get the DVD, by all means skip director Frank LaLoggia's self-aggrandizing commentary. He talks about this film as if it were Citizen Kane (it's not), and he offers gratuitous comments about filmmaking--not just this movie, mind you!--as if he were, well, Orson Welles (he ain't). In fact, he's done almost nothing else in Hollywood since this movie came out more than ten years ago, but doesn't hesitate to talk about himself as if he were a real player. The movie's entertaining enough on its own terms, but the pretentious commentary actually detracted from my enjoyment."
2,YAWWWWN...BUT O.K. I GUESS?,"In 1962 doe-eyed Haas is locked overnight on Halloween(gotta love that)in his school's cloak room,where he spies the ghost of a littlegirl murdered there 10 years earlier and becomes the target of thestill-uncaught killer. Sometimes admired,this SLOWLY(hey,what's newits a ghost story)paced film has atmosphere and good acting but isriddled with plot holes and features in my 30 yrs of watching HORRORtheeee MOST obvious identity of a mystery killer! I mean seriouslythe killer might as well wear a neon sign.Recommended for lovers of The Changling-Don't Look Now and Sixth Sense"
4,Hummnig Bird Feeder,This hummingbird feeder is huge! I didn't expect it to be so big. Other than that it's beautiful and easy to use. Now I just need some little hummingbirds to find it. :)
4,"Clean and fresh, but short lasting","I like this a lot, very clean and powdery just like her deodorant but I don't like the fact that it lasts for an hour BARELY!!!! Don't like the cheap bottle either, she could have done better for the price, very cheaply made, and I hate the top!! UGH!Overall, I don't think I would spend the $$ again."
1,DO NOT BUY - OVERPRICED,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!! Yeah it's true it's a steal for $41.00 until they charge the $28 for shipping and handling. No wonder they can sell the item for so cheap, they make up for it by over charging you on shipping. I would advise that if you're wanting to save money, buy at the store, it's $58 at Macy's which is $11 cheaper than buying from this company. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I do not remember what prompted me to buy that dreadful DVD, but I am regretful I made that expenditure. There was not much of a plot. The DVD was based on a purple talking aligator. I kept fast-forwarding to possibly see something that held my interest, but there is absolutely nothing to recommend. I rate this terrible-terrible DVD a negative 1,000."
1,Bad Film,I just want to say this tape is not worth the electricity to play it. If there was a lower rating I wouln give it a minus 5
5,My 3 year old LOVES this movie,This is a very sweet movie..great music too. My 3 year old watches it several time over the holiday season.
4,"Cute show, good animation","The movie arrived in a timely manner and about the time we expected it. The animation was very interesting, not as good as the cover leads you to believe, but interesting to watch. Adorable story."
2,Creepy...,"I purchased this for my 5 year old who loves Christmas stories. The story itself is really interesting and cute, but the animation is atrocious. Creepy looking adults and they move strangely; it's like someone animated this for a school project. I know teenagers who can animate better than this."
1,Do not buy,"This is one of the worst animations that I have ever seen. From stereotypical characters to poor animation to poor story writing and bad music, this video has all you've never wanted in a holiday film."
1,Dud DVD No 2!,This was the second of 3 DVD boxes opened Christmas day for my 5 yr old daughter and also failed due to being the wrong Region. I ordered from Indonesia for delivery to Indonesia and it was a DVD for another Region. Well done AMAZON !!
1,Excited to try...,"Was excited to try this product, have tried so many others for puffy eyes, but wasdisappointed to find it does not work, in fact, have not found, at any price, aproduct that does?Will keep trying!"
2,Hype,"Someone recommended this product for me. Naturally i bought it in search of reducing and fine lines around my eyes and I looked forward to all the benefits this eyecream promised.Well that's all it was - promises. I saw none of the benefits.I would not buy it, there are numerous products that are far superior to this one."
3,not sure it works,"I read other reviews praising this product. However, so far, after one month of use, the results are minimal. There is a slight reduction in swelling around the eyes, but my dark circles remain, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't purhase it again."
3,It's ok....,"I bought this I would say just about a year ago and thing psu fan rattles like a baby toy.It's worked really well, but I'm going with something better this go around."
4,"worked, saved an old PC","Came home from X-mas and the main family computer wouldn't turn on. No desire to buy a new computer. This fix saved a lot (luckily the power supply was the problem). The cables are basic, and expanders are needed if you have several hard drives."
2,This thing is LOUD!,"I replaced the power supply on my 3 year old Dell XPS computer. This Diablo power supply is pretty loud, way louder that the Dell (which by the way was whisper quiet). This thing weighs half as much as my Dell power supply, which tells me that it is cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for (under $20).I'm going to keep it for now just because my desktop is only a backup computer and I only turn it on once every 2 weeks or so. If you're purchasing this unit to install on a computer that is constantly running next to you, and you were used to a silent system, do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to save your sanity!"
5,Great product for a great price!,I needed a new power supply for my 5 year-old Compaq PC after the original failed. The product works great. I also love that there is a dedicated power switch on this power supply as the factory power supply lacked this feature. Would definitely buy again if needed.
4,Fully Functional PSU,I bought this to power a new graphics card. So far it works great and it isn't much louder than the PSU we had before. I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for a 400W.
1,Both died very quickly,"Bought 2 of these 400 watt'ers (1 backup) to help power my additional video card. I was shocked that the first one died suddenly right at only 6 months. I figured no problem, I have a backup so I replaced it. To my utter disappointment, the backup died in less than a week. So I re-installed the original 350 watt P/S that came with my 3 year old PC and it's been working fine. The Diablotek's came with a 3 year warranty but I won't take 2 more of the same model. I only paid $ 20 each so I guess I got what I paid for..."
4,Good buy and price,"You can tell this is a powerful power supply when it's turn on. It's abit loud, but is standard noise level when encased. I like power switch on it. Good buy and price. I bought it 2 times for two different pcs."
1,"Could Be A Great Product, But It's Not","I originally ordered this power supply to replace the one that came in my computer originally, it had just died. But , when I received this product it was not functioning as it was supposed to. It would not work at all so I asked amazon for a new one which I got but it still didn't work. I tested this product in a total of 2 computers and It didn't work in either, and one was known to work."
1,DOA,Bought this cheap power supply for an old computer and I should have known better. This thing was DOA. One positive note was that it has many SATA connectors. But on the other hand few molex connectors.
2,This is like a JET engine,I wanted this for testing my equipment. I definitely could not use this noisy thing for very long without going crazy.
4,A Little Loud,"Bought this for my family's PC, which is running an AMD FX-4100 @ stock settings with only bare-bones hardware. It works well, but runs a little loud for my tastes. It isn't too bad, but it certainly isn't designed to be quiet. Other than that, don't expect easy cable management without wire ties. The big appeal here is the low price and dependability. I haven't owned this PSU for long, but it is holding up well. If it dies, my review will be updated to reflect that."
2,Cheap and Loud,"Power Supply works fine, but is the loudest Power Supply I have ever used. Considering sending it back.Don't buy if noise may be an issue for you."
5,PS that works as expected,I swapped this for another because I needed the video card connectors. Worked fine. Had the plastic smell (new car) for a few minutes but works great.
5,Great Value For The Price,My goal was to build a computer that was capable of burning a Blu-ray disk for as little money as possible. I inherited a hand-me-down AOpen AX4SPE motherboard with a Pentium 4 processor which formed the bare bones of my setup. I added 2 GB of RAM and a Gigabyte HD 4650 1 GB graphics card all powered by a Diablotek 400-Watt ATX Power Supply. Believe it or not--this setup can indeed burn Blu-ray disks!
5,Gets the job done at a reasonable price,"I have bought several of these power supplies and they are all running without complaint (including at lest two Diablotek power supplies that have been running for over three years in a SMB environment.) This unit has two fans rather than the one that most come with. They are noisier than some, but not by a lot, and you must decide how much more it is worth to buy a quieter one. I have read other reviews in which the users had problems with reliability. There must be some reason they are so inexpensive. But this has not been my experience and I will buy more in the future."
2,avoid!,"i first order 2 and one of them had a defective power switch, which then i returned and got two more, and in that batch there was another one with a defective power switch. i would avoid this cheap power supply spend a few more dollars and get yourself a better one."
4,Cheaply made but quiet and fit. Good replacement.,"Bought to replace the PSU of my 5-year-old DELL E510 which most of the time couldn't be turned on (blinking orange power light when that happens). It's not a perfect fit but can be mounted securely. Plugs (and over all material) are cheaply made but fit ok (I guess with this price, I can't ask for more). It has 400W + 2 fans (an upgrade from the OEM one) and the SATA cable is long enough to reach the 2 hard drives mounted near the bottom of the case.Got it an hour ago, installed it right away, the computer is working now =) How long will it last? I don't know yet, but it warranties for 3 years (need to keep the box for that long too)."
4,Reliable so far & that's the power of power supply unit !,"Bought several of these over the last year or so and they are all still going strong. Not a blink, surge or rattle.Thats what a good PSU should provide ... thats the real 'power' of a PSU !"
4,Great choice for it's price,"This power supply is a great choice for those shopping on a budget. The power supple has dual fans adding better airflow through your case.A work of caution though, my video card requires a six pin power adapter that can be found on some power supplies... this however is not one of them. If your video card requires one make sure to buy a molex to PCI express power adapter."
3,Register it so your warranty is valid for 3 years!!!!!,"The good news: It worked fine from May of 2010 through early December of 2011.The bad news: It died yesterday.I still have the PSDA400's box which says that it has a three-year warranty, BUT the warranty is only valid if you register it online within 30 days of purchase -- which I hadn't.So, if you're going to buy it, REGISTER IT SO THE WARRANTY IS VALID for more than a year.I just ordered another PSDA400 (glutton for punishment?), but you can bet I'm going to register this one and keep all the materials necessary for return. If this one dies within a couple of years I'll return it and buy something else."
4,"great price, works fine, a little noisy","At this price, I can't complain. The unit is a little bit on the noisier end, but I didn't want to sink a ton of money into my aging desktop, so this does exactly the job I need it for. If you plan on having your computer in a bedroom or this is for a media PC, I'd recommend getting something quieter, but if you have a separate space where the noise won't be an issue, this is fine."
1,You Get What You Pay For...,This is complete and total junk. It does work if you dont mind the loud noise coming from the power supply. I was hoping it was the fan or fans. No chance. You can stop stop fans and the noise still comes from the unit. Could just be one unit of 1000's but this is going back! I would post a video with sound but I have wasted enough time on this PS.
2,6 months and going bad.,"Had my unit since may. About a month ago started getting a loud noise from the unit. Goes and comes. i am assuming the bearings are going bad.i can't say 'don't buy' because the price is so good. i'm going to buy another unit but one with higher power. if it does the same i will spend a little more for a more quality unit in the future.As a note, i keep my computer on for long periods of time, usually weeks."
1,Emits a high pitched noise...,"In order to update my video card, I used to this replace my 250watt power supply; however, this power supply emits an extremely annoying high pitched sound. And it isn't coming from it's fan either. It happens whenever the power flows through the unit. My old 250watt doesn't do this. I suppose I shouldn't have looked for the cheapest power supply I could find? Either way, I think I'll go for the more expensive unit."
5,Great Product,"This 400 watts power supply is all you need to build most computers. Anything over 400 watts is a preference. Its very quiet and has many connections for serial ata along with your 12 volt processor connection. I've built 7 computers for various people in the last 3 months and not one power issue. My home server is using this power supply also. For $20, you can't beat the performance and the price."
3,A good budget PS but noise level is high,"I have this running a Biostar G41-M7/Intel Celeron Dual-core budget combo in an Antec tower case. I like the 4 SATA connectors. You can definitely hear it while running. For the price, it's hard to beat."
2,failed in less than a year,"I brought this thing for a computer I built less than a year ago, and it already broke. You need the original packaging to get the warranty. I guess I can't expect much given this power supply only costs $20 and most are at least twice $40+"
1,Company Will Not Process RMA For Warranty!!,"I bought a few of these diablotek power supplies. They generally last 1 year from my expirence with them.Will my new one failed after 1 week! To do a RMA for the warranty the company makes you email them a rma request.Well i emailed that request now 3 times and no response. About 6mo. ago i had the same problem with another one that failed. After a few times emailing the RMA request form, i gave up. This company seems to ignore its customers andnot honor their warranties from my expirence twice with them. I do not reccommend these supplies at all!!!!!"
4,"Calm down, it's just a book...","People need to calm down. This is just a book. It will be okay. John Peel did his best to sort out a VERY confusing history spanning 35 years and dozens of writers. Some things were well done, others I would have done things diffrently. That's OKAY. If you have a better idea, write a Who novel yourself. This was a book that read quickly, and had fairly unique charecters. Again, I have read better, but it was very enjoyable Who. Everyone tends to agree that the interludes were well done. I would like to have seen more of them as I found them splendid. Again, a almost great Who novel by an author who always does his homework. BRAVO!"
4,A Great Tribute to the Daleks and to their creator,"If you are beginning to enter the world of Doctor Who or an old timmer, then this is an excellant book in order to start off with. Not, since I read ""Remebrance of the Daleks"", has a Dalek story been so good as this one. John Peel begins where that episode left off, and has added new classification class, that has never been there before (except in the movies). Once again the evil Davros tries to take his place over the Daleks, also that the Daleks plans are NEVER as simple as one would view them. The book is filled with action and excitement; however, it does have a few expected twists and turns towards the end."
2,A Good Ol' Civil War!,"The story that most Dalek fans have been waiting for. Unfortunately, the author seems to have gotten confused as to who exactly he was writing about. Peel's portrayal of the Dalek Prime and it's motives, just seemed too human for a Dalek.The portrayal of the Doctor was fine, albeit rather generic. The quirkiness that Paul McGann enthused his portrayal of the Doctor was gone from this literary rendition and left the entire feast of the story somewhat unpalatable."
4,My Son Loves This,"This was a Christmans present for my son who is a die hard Green Day fan like me. I thought he would like some background info on them. It was not as in good condition as I would have liked and it was missing one of the mini posters, but the CD's themselves were in great condition."
4,What anyone wants,"If you like Brittney Spears but don't like her sqeaky voice, Christina Aguilera is a great change for anyone. Shes got a great powerful voice and her music can relate to anyone. For a person who went through sooooooooo much (especially at her prom) she can keep a such a great attitude. I would reccomend her music to anyone who wants to forget about the troubles of a child, teen or even a adult."
4,embrace the banana,"my first melt banana experience was them live when they were opening for mr. bungle on bungle's 'disco volante' tour. my first impression was that this must be improvisational noise music or something just because it was so chaotic and loud. upon repeated listenings i realzied that dispite the chaos and noise these folks were writing crafted and organized songs. unfortunately, melt banana doesn't get to tour the states very often. fortunately there is this live album to give us a taste of what we are missing until the next time they come around."
4,Progress is being made,"Melt-Banana is definitely an acquired taste, and I'm glad I stuck with them past the first few releases. The music on this CD is much more accessible than the previous work and the production is a little better, too. This is just great stuff, quite different than most of the things in my collection and a real treat to listen to. Every time I listen to this one, I try to concentrate on a different member of the band to catch things I've missed. This is a real fun band, and someday I hope to see them live, having just missed them last month."
1,Wow...Just WOW!!,"I didn't think someone could screw up a 90's collection so bad. I mean this would be an ok collection at best but geez get the real singers on there atleast...Dont believe me listen to Britney Spears, Limp Bizkit or any of the others for that matter these are horrible singers that they put on here to fool people.I dedicate this review to the first review on this page thank you for pointing out how horrible this is."
2,The Real Deal This Is Not!,"I may not be able to tell on the 70's, and 80's discs , because of being young, but the 90's are a different tale.This is a total waste of money. Thankfully, Amazon allows us to listen, without purchasing.That is no *NSYNC, Backstreet, Britney, or Christina. Even the Madonna cover falls short! One would be wiser to bring out their CD, with the original performers, or search for the album version mp3s."
3,Beware of warranty,"The description says ""Lasts forever with SimpleTech's lifetime guarantee"" but when you get it you will find out that the limited warranty is only 1 year."
5,Good deal.,"For a long time, MultiMediaCards (MMCs) were a tough sell against other formats such as CompactFlash & SmartMedia (and lately vs Sony Memory Sticks too), largely because they were offered in smaller memory capacities and always had a higher cost-per-meg than those formats. Now the SimpleTech SD card (interchangeable with MMC cards), a format which has some distinct advantages over the other formats in terms of physical size, power use, write speed and memory protection, comes out at *less than* fifty cents per meg here in a giant size. This is long overdue and most welcome. SimpleTech cards have been very reliable despite their modestly discounted price."
4,Snuffy and Beetle,No need to reiterate most of the reviewers info above but if you are a fan of either Beetle Bailey or Snuffy Smith then you'll be impressed with the quality of these. Just wish it was the entire series. The discs offer DTS 5.1 sound as well (apparently from the original mono tracks).Quality 10 / Sound 10. No inserts or labels on discs.Reason I gave this a 4 star is wished the entire series was included for each of these 2 cartoons. (not familar with cartoons on disc 2)
4,Well written,"This installment of White Wolf's long series of Clanbooks is possibly the best. The book is rich in content and atmosphere, providing a guided tour of Vampire: The Masquerade's most insular clan.Justin Achilli breathes new life into a formerly one-dimensional clan as he details their debased practices and horrific goals.Not for the faint of heart, but well worth the purchase price."
4,"interesting reading, very interesting","Only one thing really sticks out as a major flaw - the total LACK of details on how the Giovanni hunted down all the Cappadocians.Of course, this could be covered in the upcoming Samedi book, but it's more than relevant to see it in the Giovanni book.Some of the clan's families seemed a bit superfluous, and pointless The cannibalistic Scottsmen, for example..."
2,Where did the quality go?,"This is the last of White Wolf's clanbooks for the Vampire game -- and thank heavens, because the quality has gone steadily downhill. Though this is a definate improvement over the Clanbook: Tzimisce, it's still far too vulgar and disgusting to bring into a family household. I hope that, with the release of the new edition of the game, the darkness and brooding mood will remain, but the vulgarity will be done away with."
4,Not a lot of action--but I still couldn't put it down!,"Ms. Chaikin has once again wowed us with another awesome book. This one didn't have as much action in it, but it was still a very good book. The romance was wonderful, and the plot was excellent. Can't wait to see what happens next!"
1,dirty rotten scroundrels soundtrack,"I paid 30.00 for this item and it did not have the favorite song in the whole movie, what the movie was about, Putting on the Ritz. It truly saddened me that Amazon would sell this or it could be called a soundtrack without that song. I would love to get my hands on, as I call it, French Violin music. It is absolutely beautiful.Thanks"
4,Great timing,The purchase went well I recieved my book before i was quoted to recieve it and the book was in great condition. I couldn't have asked for anything better!!
2,"$1,200??","I bought the 1997 edition of this book, with CD, in 2001 for $70.00 -- I cannot recommend it as being worth more than that. I really didn't find it to be very useful for my original intent, which was to have a good reference for instrumental techniques, including those used in pharmaceutical and biological research. The CD included with the book has a simple, almost DOS level, program that installs and aids to some small extent in picking specific methods to do analysis of some sample type you input. My only comment is that, if you need this kind of gimmick to choose your analytical method, you would be better off getting into a job or a class that uses current analytical instrumentation.Having seen the current offering price and since I still have the book, little used, my quandary is whether I should be offering it for some highly inflated price, or go ahead and give it to the Goodwill as I was about to do."
3,Una selección con tapa engañosa,"Las tres estrellas que le otorgué a este disco son porque los temas que lo conforman son magníficos y las versiones mejores, todo está bien. Pero lo que es engañoso es que esa tapa corresponde a un disco de Milton llamado ""Caador de mim"" y este CD: ""Noticias do Brasil"" es en realidad una selección de temas de ""Caador de mim"" y otro llamado ""Anima"". Recomendación: comprar los dos discos originales en vez de esta truchada."
1,This book is a waste of your money,"Buying this book is probably the worst purchase decision that I have ever made. This book is more like a small glossary of financial terms and entities. As far as diagrams and tables are concerned, there are none. Even the basics like confirms, trade matching, reconcilliation are not covered."
2,Splender Bender? or Fender Bender,13 year old girl from mdI dont actually own this book but alot of m friends have it. It is a very cute idea. BUT.... the book comes with the little magnetic bendable figure and then the book is just pictures of things you can put with the bender to make it look like things.For example they have mummy (name of bender person) and it is the bender wraped in toilet paper with his/her arms raised... This is a verry cool thing if you recive it as a gift but i dont think it is worh the money.
5,This Is The Only Book You'll Need!,"I bought this book because my fiance was about to be the best man in a wedding. He was nervous because he had no idea what best men do. This book was all he needed. It tells what the best man's duties are to the groom, bride and everyone else. Tells about etiquette and even talks about what to do in specific religious or cultural weddings. What we found even more useful was it's section on speeches and toasts. We had bought a book especially for that, but it wasn't any good. This book explained the do's and don'ts and gave great examples that helped my fiance to write a great speech. (by the way, his speech went beautifully) He got a big laugh from the crowd and an Ahhh. Just what you want. This book is a must have for any groomsmen or Best man."
1,what a bad travel accessory !!!!!!!,"I tried to iron a shirt and it was a nightmare. it leaks and all the floor around got wet.In addition to that, you can spend an hour just ironing a sleeve.It is a pretty bad system, please do not purchase it, listen to a friend who is warning you!!!!"
4,"quick , fun and informative to read about these stars",it was fun to hear about these porn stars real lifes and it was a quick book to read. the interviews were well written and it was interesting to see they were real people too
4,A Wonderful Selection of Mystic Thoughts,"An almost perfect little book to give an overview of mysticism. Sometimes too short of selections, but one can always go to the source. A couple little quibbles, one being the omission of a John of Patmos' Book of Revelation selection. A truly mystical book if ever there was one. And, then a statement the author makes concerning the Apostle Paul. The author states in the summary of the Mystics at the back of the book, that Paul never refereed to himself as a mystic. Paul says in Gal. 2:20, ""...I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me..."" (KJV) which is the very essence of mysticism. An excellent book to be able to see the commonality of all religions and truly makes you wonder why there is so much hate for those of different faiths."
5,Manna.,"Manna. Press to your heart, open anywhere, get fueled for the journey. Harvey's intros to each of the world mystic traditions are as informed and poetic as the collections themselves. A voice of Fire."
2,Way overpriced,The materials in this kit could be picked up at a local pharmacy for a fraction of the cost and the bag itself seems to be of the quality of a cheap lunch bag.
3,smooth but stiff,"These pillow cases, made in China, need I say more? Very stiff and hard to get on and off the pillows, but smooth enough to sleep on. Should last a long time. The color is a bit odd (camel) but they look slightly pink in the light of an incandescent bulb on the ceiling.JL"
5,SO SOFT,These are so soft and what a GREAT PRICE for 2 king size 1200 thread count pillow cases... now I want the sheets!!
4,Not as soft as expected but tightly woven for durability,"I've never heard of a 1200 thread count and the price was so good, I couldn't resist. The weave is so tight, I'll bet the water beads up in the washer before the soap gets in and breaks the barrier! I do have to say that they're not as soft as I expected, although they are fairly soft - but perhaps with a couple more washings they will be much better. I'll bet that they will last a lot longer than general (100 to 200-thread count) pillowcases and through a LOT more wash loads, so I still think this is a GREAT deal!"
5,Great Product !,Thick and smooth is how I describe these pillowcases!!!! Very nice at a great price! I would buy these again. I ordered two not knowing that they came two per order. So I kept the extra two. Very well made and they get softer after every wash. These will last a long time. Parchment is a beautiful color!
3,Omnibook 6100 refurbished--INSUFFICIENT INFORMATON,"Need, memory, O/S, Disk size,CD vs DVD-ROM???The technical data are completely insufficient!!"
5,Cheaper than a phone call!,"Finally, a novel where you CAN judge a book by it's cover! Merely reading the title is enough to know this novel is destined to be prominent fixture in your 79 cent book collection. Such a brilliant book can only mean that the author's daughter is destined to be an atmospheric scientist who can only communicate with equations. Look for her follow up: Into the Back Country: A Potential Vorticity (PV) Approach."
2,NOT BAD NOT GOOD,"After one year of use -and without unplugging it at all-, I have to use glue to fix it because the plug of the cable separated of it. I could fix it and the cable is still working."
5,des mots d'amour....,"Sylvie est mon idole de toujours ,je l'aime de tout mon coeur et cet album est un bijou comme tous ses albums d'ailleur.Il n'y-a rien à redire et tout est absolument super genial.Quant au dernier album:""SENSIBLE"",c'est aussi un bijou suplementaire dans sa vie son oeuvre.Toute mes condoleances et ma peine pour l'incendie qui s'est passe dans la maison de ""JACKIE COLLINS"".Je vous embrasse et j'espere que vous continuerai le plus longtemps possible."
1,stick to what you know,"very uneven work. After beautiful, modern interpretations of Bach's Cello Suites comes a boring, uninspired and timid ""original"" instrument recording. Ma has always jumped on bandwagons, this time he missed it by a mile. For listeners interested in orginal instrument recordings, skip this one."
5,"Terrific work from Yo-Yo Ma, a must-to-have !!","Yo-Yo has done a terrific work with ABO, taking deep care with the baroque cello and the way to play it as it was designed. Modifying it for this recordings shows Yo-Yo's great interest in playing music as close as it is possible to the original recordings and masters who wrote them. Very good work !!"
5,Simple Baroque is Simply Terrific!,I purchased this CD the day after it was released and gave it to my husband for Valentine's Day. He is the worlds biggest Yo Yo Ma fan and I knew he didn't even know this CD was available. He was so surprised and when he listened to it he was absolutely thrilled. Everything about this collection is delightful and you won't be disappointed.
3,Tweet Tweet,"I've gotten other Audubon Plush Birds that make the authentic bird sound in the past. Typically, the bird sounds are crisp and clear, enough so that my niece enjoys using the stuffed birds to ""talk"" to the birds in and around my house. I thought this would make a good addition to our collection, however it sounds as thought the Mourning Dove's call is a bit distorted. I don't know if it's poor sound quality or if the Plush Bird itself was damaged at some point, but the sound is not as crisp and clear as what I've come to expect from this company, thus the 3 stars."
2,Audubon Mourning Dove,All the other varieties of birds made by Wild Republic have amazingly authentic sounds but the Mourning Dove's sound is not natural at all. The company I purchased it through was very helpful and professional in handling the problem. Enjoy the other varieties but skip the Mourning Dove.
3,good,This is probably the best volume in the New Daily Study Bible series. I would also recommend Hebrews for Everyone by Tom Wright and Hebrews by George H. Guthrie.
3,Useful,"A useful reference for Bible Study, although I did find a couple of instances of beliefs contrary to those held by us Catholics. Also, it is not as in-depth as, for example, Barkley's Book of Luke, which often brought me to tears with it's beautiful analysis. I thought this was more ""on the surface"" than Luke. In that respect, I was a little disappointed. Nonetheless, I believe this may help expand on concepts taught by other references."
5,Worth the money,Beautiful BEAUTIFUL music for a wonderful movie - we 're-live' the movie every time we listen to it. Highly recommend it!
4,Beautiful,"October Sky is a great movie with a wonderful soundtrack. The music is beautiful and passionate. The only reason I rated it four stars instead of five was because every time I was near sleep, The Platters would come up!"
5,My Son's Favorite Movie,I really like this movie but I purchased for my 10 year old son. He loves it so much that he has watched it over and over on HBO. He read the large book when he was 9 and then I bought the video for him which he has watched over and over. If anyone is interested in true stories or science or rocketry or just something where there is a happy ending you'll enjoy this movie.
2,Bottom of the barrel,"I found this box set a considerable disappointment. Big step down from Proper's previous superb Western Swing anthology: Doughboys, Playboys and Cowboys: the Golden Age of Western Swing. A few good pieces but for most part both songs and playing are undistinguished. They might be hard to find, but perhaps there is an obvious reason for this obscurity. Also, as a previous reviewer has noted, many of songs are Western Swing only by broadest possible definition of term.This is the fourth 4 CD set of Western Swing music Proper has put out (besides Doughboys, etc. the other two showcase Bob Wills and Milton Brown). Could be by now bottom of barrel is being scraped. In any case, the result here is ordinary music. Don't invest your money in this box set; buy Doughboys, Playboys and Cowboys instead. You won't be sorry."
5,Kavbojci,"Je treba spoznat korenine. Ena izmed njih je tudi kabojski swing, ki ni niti tako slab, nasprotno, mi je èedalje bolj vsèe. Zaradi navedenega, bom naroèil se veè CD-jev z navedenega podroèja. Navedena kompilacija, pa mi je vseè !!!OK ! Lepo pozdrav Stojan Borstnar"
3,Latin Readings for Review,"This Latin review elementary study book is great for the beginning student. Not only is it fun to read, but it is fun to translate. A must for all Latin students."
3,dead but alive,"Hans wakes up one day and reads his obituary in the paper. Someone has stolen his name. Who? Why? And what game is The Joker playing?A nice book, but not his best. Lars SC has written so many good books (Beatles, Bly, Gutten som ville vaere en av gutta, Billettene, Jubel, Herman...) so I was a bit disappointed with this one. But he still is the best Norwegian writer of today!"
2,GLORIFIED FAN FILM,"I am a fan of fan films, and very lob budget productions. However, even after watching this and giving the director/producer props for the effort, I found this movie to be pretty horrible (and that is being compared to other FF and LBP). Compared to the director's other films, Demon Summer being one of them, the film sill falls flat.The acting is of course bad, the characters are bad, the story is bad. The blood, well, it's LB and pretty alright for what we are dealing with.However, I did laugh alot with this film. The gay couple was a riot, and at the end when his paperclip chainmail armor saves his life---classic.Only buy this if you can get it used for under 2 bucks, also check out Demon Summer--which was an alright film."
2,just didn't do it for me,"This is a nicely put together little box. However, I found the instructional DVD to be a bit strange... I just couldn't watch the whole thing. I think it would have felt more comfortable if he wasn't using the woman as a dummy for the breathing work. I understand he wanted to talk and let her do the breathing, and point out things on her body, but it just didn't work for me. Like I said, nice quality and all that, I just couldn't get into the presentation."
3,I could do without the moaning,"I do like this video and believe it to be helpful, but I agree with one other review that the woman in the video made it uncomfortable. I could definitely do without Astara's moaning as she was breathing... the whole time, even while he was talking, you hear these moans going on in the background! Then he encourages the ""sounds of pleasure!"" It's almost pornographic--almost! Oh well."
4,Just like I remember 40 years ago.......,"One of the first; a good core chinese martial arts movie to have in your collection. Not ruined with the stupid English dubbing that was so prevalent in the 1970's nor including the comic relief (ie. idiot chinese moron) that is not only insulting and embarrassing to the audience, but also just breaks the tempo or momentum of many action movies."
1,this moive is bad!,I do not know what moives you people like or have seen I bought this moive on the recommended people here and all I can say is do not belive everything you read. I have been a collecting Kung-fu moives since 1973and this is one of the worst the action is like in slow motion for a child and I have seen more action sleeping on a plane all I can say is stay away from this one PLEASE!
5,Shaw Brothers Classic,"Dragon Dynasty continutes to deliver great Shaw Brothers films one after the other. The 27th film to be released by Dragon Dynasty and their 6 Shaw Brothers release, you can't go wrong with this one. Widely considered to be one of the best Hong Kong films ever made, one can see why. It carries a great story along with awesome fight scenes and fantastic acting by Cheng Pei-Pei(commentary included with her and Bey Logan) and Yueh Hua.Special Features include:Feature Commentary with Bey Lognan/Cheng Pei PeiKing and I-Director Tsui Hark reflections on filmCome Speak With Me-Interview with Cheng Pei PeiA Classic Remembered-Retrospective with Bey LoganReturn of Drunken Master-Interview with Yueh HuaTrailer Gallery"
5,The Great King Hu,"One of the most important and influential films in the history of martial art movies. There would be no ""Crouching Tiger"", ""Hero or House of Flying Daggers"" without ""Come Drink With Me"". King Hu was one of the greatest directors in Chinese cinema. Of the best sort lived directors King Hu stands among others like Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone and Orson Wells. Also see ""Dragon Gate"" Inn and his masterpiece ""A Touch of Zen""."
2,I WANTED to like it...,"If you are familiar with Shaw Brothers, then you know that this is not your first choice of their films. First, to it's credit (or more specifically to the credit of Dragon Dynasty) the film is restored really well and has a great picture.What I don't like is that nearly every fight scene, of which there are many, are implied martial arts. It is edited in such a way that you really don't see a whole lot of action. What you do see is simple, and disapointing. The story is decent for a kung-fu film, but compared to other Shaw Brothers classics, especially their earlier releases, this leaves much to be desired.If you are looking for some great martial arts, this is probably not a good choice."
4,It is ok...,"The colors are great. The metallic colors do not have lasting power. Over a month, a lot of the eyeshadow was in the lipgloss. Its a cute set just not something I would give to anyone else."
5,Practical Writing,I have been thoroughly enjoying this book. It takes the reader/writer on a journey into their creativity and improving their writing. I loved the reading and the exercises. There was no end to the ways in which the reader/writer could interact with this book. Definitely not a sit down and read type of book. It makes creativity boil over onto your own paper. Great book!!!
4,steering the craft,This is a good book. I've learned so much from it. the exercises are great. This is a must have for all aspiring writers.
5,Their strong song writing and musical abilities proves their undeniable raw tale,"The new 12 song album opens up with the beautiful dark classical inspired intro of My Nightmare, then quickly turns into all out rage and anger, describing the story of a tormented person who is fighting to survive an abusive relationship. The following track Aria is equally interesting showing off singer Angela Timon's amazing classically trained voice, as the band blends metal and opera. The band shows their softer side on Water and Wicked Trick, coupled with the most touching, heartfelt lyrics of the album. While letting loose on punk influences in the songs Puppet Master and Distorted. One can tell that much thought went into the creation of each song on the album, with lyrics about life that everyone can relate to. If you want to experience a truly strange yet beautiful album, If Man Is Five's Blood is the Ink Hate is the Story, will have you dropping your jaw to the floor"
4,Interesting pair of films,"I had already seen ""18 Again"" on VHS, and ofcourse it had improved on the DVD transfer. Areal charmer, Burns last starring film. ""Soul Man""I'd heard of but never saw. I wondered about reactionto Howell's make up job, what with a the sensitivityabout ""blackface"". A negative review of the timereferred to it as minstrel make up which of courseis nonsense. This is darker makeup, friends, and nothing minstrel about it. In fact the plot has itas sun-tanning pills in a heavy dose (!). I thoughtit was a very good film overall especially the scenewhere Howell handily takes care of a table of jerksmaking racist jokes in the cafeteria."
3,"Great photos, weak story","I was expecting a little more description of French landmarks than what was in the book. Cute story, but a little lengthy to reach the conclusion it did. Slightly disappointed."
5,Love Red,This is a great bag. I get so many compliments on it. I love that the front zipper opens all the way and the pockets are a perfect size. the lap top case is an extra bonus that makes this bag a must have!
1,very heavy but does not accomodate my laptop,"- This bag itself is really heavy. This bag + my another heavy laptop - it's not an optimal business travel at all. And the long shoulder strap is not sturdy and really uncomfortable.- More than anything elas my laptop does not fit in the laptop compartment inside the bag. I double checked the amazon.com page and just found the size of the bag only, but could NOT the inner compartment size . Please specify it and provide the right information to your customer.- I had to return it immediately. what a waste of time and money."
2,"nice looking, but not as functional","It's a beautiful, expensive looking bag; however, I am a teacher and carry a lot of papers to and from work. This is not the back for me. I need something more flexible so I can throw whatever in there. This bag is very stiff - it requires careful organization of my items and I just can't do it.Back it goes!"
5,Beautiful and Sturdy,"This briefcase is gorgeous and very sturdy. Pleased with the quality and appearance. It is a bit small - with my laptop (it is a Dell and a tad chunky) and bulky power cord in it there is barely room for a small notebook. Without the laptop there would be room for carrying quite a lot of paper, but you have to pick and choose."
5,This is a beautiful bag,"The person I bought this for loves it. It says ""accomplished professional"" loud and clear.Well-made and durable. Withstands the weather nicely.Lots of room for a laptop and files and girl stuff. Worth every dime."
4,Perfect Laptop Bag that everyone thinks is a purse,"This bag is perfect for what I was looking for - a professional looking laptop bag with plenty of pockets and space to hold everything, while not looking bulky or manly.Two complaints: First, I commute over an hour each way to work on a train, and the bag is a little bit heavy. Definitely lighter than my bulky cloth Targus bag that my company provided with the PC, but it becomes a little cumbersome after standing with it on my shoulder for an hour.Secondly, it may just be because the bag is new, but it is pretty stiff. Once you put the laptop in, it's hard to get your hands all the way in (granted, I have pretty big hands) to reach in for a mouse, charger, etc. The separate pocket for keys/cell phone/pens/etc. is less stiff and accessable from the outside."
3,Lack of Information,"I was unhappy to see that this book did not contain explicit hat making instructions. The best example was chapter 5 on straw hats. In the instructions you are told to sew the straw braid together either by hand or machine but did not tell you if you should butt the straw braid together or over lap the braid. No help was given for hand sewing the braid either... what stitch to use? Nothing was mentioned about machine settings either. For example, if you use a straight stitch how long should the stitch be? If you use a machine zigzag stitch what is the best length and width. I was also surprised at the how to pictures in the book. I expected better close-ups. This was my first book about millinery so my expectations may be too high but I still feel the book left out a lot of very important information."
2,Art of making miniature millinery,"This book was decent, but I bought this book specifically for the hat of the boat on the cover. I was extremely disappointed that that hat was not in it. If I would have known that ahead of time, I would probably not have bought it. So the cover is a bit misleading."
1,Sorry I bought this,I purchased this product to get a feel for distance and speed for an endurance horse I'm training. Sure wasted my money on this. Within 2 hours of receiving the product the face fell off. I found that it would not retain the correct date either. I also found that if you don't stay completely out in open spaces (no trees) it does not work. I didn't expect spectacular results but I sure thought for $150 it would work as well as a $10 watch. It doesn't. Don't waste your money.
3,Not as great as I hoped it would be,"I purchased this for myself after hearing an instrumental from this CD on XM radio several times. I still like listening to that one instrumental, but don't enjoy the other tracks as much. I was surprised that most of the tracks have vocals. Maybe I need to look at her CD, ""The Instrumentals"". My advice: If you can, try to listen to samples of all the tracks before you buy."
4,cool toy,"I hated the movie--it was too sad! But I really liked the mooses! So, my mom got them for me and I really like them. They are cool."
4,A pretty good Star Trek book.,"Star Trek Log Five is a pretty good collection of three stories from the animated television series. The first story, ""The Ambergris Element,"" I though was a little boring. But this is an enjoyable book."
1,1/2 a movie,"I recently purchased not once, but twice, the classic movie ""Robin Hood ,Prince of thieves"" with Kevin Cosner. The first time we watched the movie it stopped right in the middle, leaving us hanging....so I returned the movie and ordered another one. I thought ""what are the chances of this happening again?"" well......it did! The movie stopped in the exact spot the second time around. We were left feeling quite frustrated and confused as to what kind of movies Amazon deals with? I will not be purchasing movies from them anymore. The movie was on cable this week....we taped it!"
4,Excellent renditition of an old story,"Very good telling of an old story. Take away the bad acting on the part of the Sheriff, the other actors performed with great sincerity and passion. Especially good was the Lady Miriam.The only drawback to this movie was the Sheriff, who seemed to be little better than a clown. Morgan Freeman fit in quite well."
2,"Love the Movie - 2 Sided Disc, Not So Much","I love this movie. I owned it on VHS and was looking to upgrade, so I bought this DVD. It's a 2 sided disc so you have to turn the disc over half way through the movie just to watch the rest. Lame. I was also a bit disappointed that the video by Bryan Adams wasn't at the end with the credits like it was on the VHS. It was also at the end of the movie in the movie theatre too, so I'm not sure why they would exclude it on the DVD. I love this movie and hate to give it any thing less than a 4, but because of the DVD format, I'm giving it a 2."
1,"Great Movie, Bad quality Product !!!!","I just love this movie but this version of the Blu-ray is just junk.- Slim box whit poor quality.- Bad restauration of me movie, I already see very older movies whit better visual treatment, this is just like a VHS.- Very limited extras, no ""title menus"", just a ""pause ecreen"" whit de options plus extras.I'm very fan os this movie, probably i'll resell this bad taste product and search (or whait) a new version."
3,Extended but not improved,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, but I was disappointed by this extended version because the added scenes actually detract from the movie instead of adding to it. They also seem to be scenes that arbitrarily re-explain some of the plot points that have already been stated so that viewers not paying as much attention or who aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer can have their hand held in order to follow along.Lastly, even though there is a whole disc of special features, neither disc has the Bryan Adams music video with him playing the piano in the woods like the VHS does! Major disappointment."
4,Robin Hood,"This film is a `90s version of the classic Robin Hood story, with Kevin Costner starring as the good-guy thief. Costner is joined in his efforts against the murdering Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Richman) who once again proves why he makes an excellent villain. Richman won best supporting actor in the British Academy Awards for his excellent roll.Along with Morgan Freeman who plays a philosophizing side kick Azeem, and by Nick Brimble, who plays Little John (anything but little). After Robin barely survives a watery skirmish with Little John, the two become allies and Robin joins forces with Little John's band of robber thieves to overcome the evils of the Nottingham sheriff.You don't really have to be a die-hard Robin Hood fan to enjoy this movie. The film has a few flaws and stretches the historical aspect somewhat but it plays out well with plenty of action, adventure, humor, and fun.Robin Hood Price of Thieves was directed by Kevin Reynolds and produced by Warner Studios."
4,Impressive.,"When I first saw this movie, I was a little surprised. More or less the movie is pretty historically accurate...of course not including that Robin Hood is a legend. The portrayal of King Richard's Crusades is believable, even despite the lack of accents. This movie is not for the squeamish however. The beignning scene in the Turkish prison is stomach turning as with poor Duncan who lost his eyes. All in all, a good movie."
3,Robinhood with American Accent and American Humor?,"The movie is not bad if you DID NOT KNOW about Mr Hood. However, I grew up reading the story in two different languages, and it was hard for me to see a Robinhood with so much of American elements. What were the makers' thinking?"
1,Half the movie!,Only half of the movie was available for viewing! I ordered 2 of the same DVD (one of me and one for my sister) and they BOTH were only half of the movie. It ends at Scene 17!
1,This movie does not play - come up with wrong regon code,This movie ordered on line - but does not play in this region. Replace it please with a copy that will replay in Australia
2,"Good Movie, bad DVD","So I love this movie, but look for a different DVD version to buy. This one reminded me of an 8-track or vinyl record. Half the movie is recorded on one side and the other half on the other side. It stops abruptly in the middle of the movie. At first, I thought something was wrong with the DVD and wanted to return it to Amazon. Then I took it out and noticed it was dual layer, so I turned it over and tried that. But seriously, why even bother. A DVD is plenty large enough to hold this movie. There aren't any special features on here to take up space."
3,"Good Movie, Poor Setup","The movie and dvd quality is fine, but be aware that it comes in 2-discs, with half the movie on one and half the movie on the other. You physically have to swap them out to finish the movie. Quite an annoyance. Everything else was fine."
4,SOO much better than the DVD version.,"While the movie itself is kind of a guilty pleasure, this Blu-Ray version fixes several issues that the DVD version had. First of all, the re-mastering of the film. On the DVD some of the scenes (such as the prison scene in the beginning) were SO dark, Morgan Freeman all but disappeared! Hell, KOSTNER was hard to see! No longer an issue on Blu-Ray. Also, the volume between the speaking parts and the musical score have been leveled quite sufficiently! Take the ""extended"" scenes for what they are, they do add some context to a few scenes that were a bit of a mystery to me in the theatrical version. The relationship between Mortiana and the Sherriff is FAR more clear. A few of the other extended scenes showed why they were cut though. All-in-all I'm very happy with it. Good entertainment, especially for the price."
2,"5 for content, but 2 for effort!","Despite the accents and geographic anomalies this rousing movie is presented with bravado and plenty of 'swash-buckling"" to boot. A strong opening is followed by a bit of a slow down, but the pace picks up nicely and delivers the viewer a powerful ending, the epilogue is a little cheesy but the cameo 'King Richard' is a nice surprise!The only draw back.... It's a Flipper!!Halfway through the film you have to turn the disk over to play the other side (a 'feature' noticeably missing from the technical details) which whilst not life threatening is certainly annoying.However, if you like a good movie that you can escape into and leave the real world behind then this would do for you.(relates to the DVD version)"
2,Poor blu-ray transfer,"Five stars for the movie and two for the blu-ray/HD transfer. Like many pre-2003 movies, this one has rather poor clarity and sharpness prevalent in most newer blu-ray movies. Some of the darker scenes are heavily pixelated and are comparable to VHS quality....from a very worn out tape. There are even a couple of spots where the audio is grossly out of sync with the video. Warner Bros. should be ashamed for releasing mess such as this! If you can get this on sale, then get it solely for it being the extended version. Otherwise, don't waste your money and opt for the cheaper DVD version instead."
1,PASS!PASS!PASS!,I wont bore you with the details...suffice it to say that it was a let down in every sense of the word. View at your own risk....of falling asleep. Its better than Ambien.
1,"Great movie, terrible DVD","I love this movie, but have refrained from buying the dvd for one reason: YOU HAVE TO FLIP THE DVD OVER!That's right - the movie is on both sides of the disc, and halfway through the movie you have to get up and flip the disc over. This is an unnecessary inconvenience that ruins the experience of the movie."
5,Still love it!,"I remember when this movie came out. I went to watch it three times and that is really saying something coming from me. Well when I found this, I was like ""Yea!!!!!!!!"" Bought it and watched and LOVED all the new scenes that were originally deleted. It is the best Robin Hood even if several actors do not have English accents ;)"
3,Movie was good; DVD version was not.,"We loved this movie and watched it several times. However, this was a cheap copy sold as original. The playback stopped halfway through and we had to flip the disc to watch the second half. The disc was relatively inexpensive, so I guess we got what we paid for. Do your research before purchasing a disc. Make sure you get an original copy from the production house or you could be in for random surprises like this."
3,Could be better!,"As is customary with Warner Brothers, this is an excellent production visually. The problem is that even though I very much like Kevin Costner most of the time, this is not his roll. Actually I think it's more the script and the directing than his acting. Those two items leave much to be desired! Kevin could have dropped the phoney English accent too--it would have helped a lot. It's worth a look but not a keeper."
5,Robin Hood,Kevin can play all my favorites. I loved him as Wyatt Earp and he does a good job as Robin Hood.
3,"Great Movie, Terrible Extentions","This is a great movie--not perfect, but good enough that I easily overlook all the faults commonly complained about. Unfortunately, however, there are only two versions of it on DVD. One you have to flip the dvd over half way through, and then there's this one--extended cut.Extended versions are tricky. I have seen few that are better than the theatrical version. Pretty much all the extended scenes are with the Sheriff and Mortiana, and very dark. I didn't even feel that they added anything to the plot.Sigh. I'm still waiting for this to come out in a better DVD version to purchase it. Although, I may be waiting in vain."
3,What!?,"I love this movie, but I thought it was so lame, in this version, that I had to flip the disk over to finish the thing! Was there really that much information that you couldn't have but the whole movie on one side of the disk? Lame."
5,Response to an earlier review,"I have to agree with the other positive reviews of the Two-Disc special extended edition. I do want to respond to one reviewer who said that key scenes were cut from the original... I'm not sure about the other scenes referred to, but I am currently watching the movie, and I can definitly say the scene where Robin cuts the Sheriff's cheek is in the extended version. It is very fast... the cutting sequence is probably less than 1/2 second so you have to be watching for it... but it is there."
2,"Costner is not topping Errol Flynn, it's an OK Robin Hood movie","After the masters of the sword Douglas Fairbanks & Errol Flynn Oscar Winner Kevin Costner takes on the Sheerwood Forest Outlaw in 1991's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Costner wasn't very good and he's not even brittish anyway, a Brit or Australian must play Robin Hood, there wasn't enough sword fights like ""the Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring the best Robin, Errol Flynn, even the Disney version is better than this. Robin Hood is like Tarzan & James Bond, There's been several Tarzans, but Johnny Weissmuller is the best, several James Bonds, but Sean Connery is the best. thats how it is with Robin of Locksley, Flynn is the best, Kevin Costner is allright"
4,Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves.,My sister and I watched this DVD a few weeks ago and truly enjoyed it.
5,Great Movie,"I have loved this movie since I watched it in high school on the bus for fieldtrips. This is an excellent movie. It is a movie that unlike many of the movies that come out now actually have a story and complete the story not leaving it open for a sequel. There is action and adventure with a mild love story throw in, but not the premise. My husband watched this movie for the first time when I bought this and he enjoyed it as well."
4,.,"Kevin Costner really sucks, there's no getting around that. But this is a highly entertaining adventure movie, very Hollywood, but very well-rounded and realized. Having the Moor sidekick is a bit much if you really think about it, but insofar as the Christian world being portrayed as anti-science, ignorant, backwards, etc., I have to disagree with the reviewer from Chicago a few reviews back -- those were the *exact* characteristics of the Christian church at that time, based on what I've read. Hell, those are *still* the characteristics of many divisions of Christianity. But in any case, I don't think Christianity is beign sh*t on here -- the Friar Tuck only first appears as a ""worthless drunkard,"" but eventually shows through as a very noble character. Anyhow, this is a fine film, and pure escapism, so it's silly to nit-pick details that don't gel with ""delicate sensibilities"" ... it's just a fun, epic medieval adventure."
1,"very, very poor movie","Costner's terrible accent. A lot of meaningless, gory dungeon scenes. The supposedly ""enlightened"" Moor in a movie that opens up in a Moorish dungeon. If they are going to insult my intelligence by saying 13th century Europeans couldn't even count, then they are the fools. A reprehensible farce.The Robin Hood in this movie is a dull, passionless anti-hero. If you make it to the end of this stupid film, you might find yourself wondering what was the point of the whole thing."
2,Not In Like Flynn,"An ok on a rainy day movie, and granted this is a different type of adaptation than it's predecessor,but Costner can never compare to the wonderful talent and the exceedingly good looks of Errol Flynn. I own Flynn's and I watch it over and over again. I could not do that with this one. Breaks my heart that Flynn will never get an Oscar for his ability, and some of the present day actors could not compare to him and they still rake them in. Costner is a talented actor, but no comparison. Watching this adaptation, I missed the wit and charm of the heartbreaking Robin Hood that Mr Errol Flynn portrayed. We miss you Errol."
3,Robin Hood Prince of Thieves,"Received the movie in good time frame, however issue with movie not playing all the way through. I have found the same issue 2 previous times purchasing this movie at Walmart. Think possibly bad batch. At this point returning it will only cost me more money out of my pocket. So I just give up with this movie. Bummer."
3,"double sided, not dual layer... disappointed!",I thought they should have included the Bryan Adams single that was on the laserdisc version.. my boy Bill loves that song.
2,A Pale Imitation of a Recognized Classic,"You know what I'm talking about; ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring Errol Flynn. Comparing that classic film with this Costner drek is like comparing ""Road Warrior"" with......""Water World""? The Flynn version is fun and light hearted. Costner's version is only pandering to modern sensibilities.C'mon, the movie reeks of political correctness Maid Marion fighting in black armor? Great a strong female character, Morgan Freeman as Robin's sidekick? Hey, the wise token ethnic character.(Sorry Morgan,you were good, but unnecessary)Christian Slater? Stick him in for more youth appeal. If you must watch it, fast forward through any parts that don't feature Morgan Freeman or Alan Rickman."
1,Men in Tights,"Kevin Costner is a thought actor. He works best alone, in close up, with his inner thoughts casting shapes and shadows on his face. This is why ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Field of Dreams"" were such successful films. Interacting with other actors he becomes at best mediocre. Put him in green stockings and get him to gallivant around Sherwood Forest speaking with a stupid English accent he hasn't broken in yet, and he looks like a complete dork. This film is also spoiled by its countless anachronisms. For example Moors were Arabs or Berbers, not so different from Southern Europeans. They definitely weren't African Americans."
1,Poor movie with few redeeming points,"Let's start with the positive- Alan Rickman does a terrific job as the sheriff. The low points of the movie are too numerous to mention, but I'll start with Kevin Costner, hopelessly miscast as Robin Hood. Even local dinner theatre actors can summon up a decent English accent- Costner doesn't even attempt one. Instead, he deadpans his way throughout the movie, a sad omen of the rapid decline of his once promising career. Morgan Freeman does a credible job of breathing life into a multicultural stereotype- the urbane, civilized, enlightened Moor, lightyears ahead of ignorant, hypocritical Christians. This stab at political correctness fails- the myth of enlightened Islam, in Spain or elsewhere, is only a myth. In reality, the Moor would have tried to kill the infidels.Avoid this movie at all costs- poor acting, political correctness, and other flaws too numerous to mention ruin the movie."
1,My brand new DVD was cut short and had no ending!,"I was really excited to get my movies, but extremely disappointed when the first movie I watched (Robin Hood Prince of Thieves) cut short of the ending. It just went blank in the middle of the movie as if it had no ending. I tried going back to the main menu and choosing a scene I also trie fast forwarding to it. It was NOT there!!!! My movie is defective... what do I do now???"
1,Half the movie is missing,"Received the movie, am watchin it, got to scene 17 and it ended. Lack of quality control"
1,Ruined the entire story of Robin Hood,Anyone who has ever read Robin Hood knows that it has that same humorous quality that the Three Musketeers has. The stories are always light and fun with plenty of action. This rendition is aweful. It doesn't even make a very good historical portrait. How many times does someone have to throw their bow on the ground. It took upwards of three months to make a long bow. Kevin Costner has an incredible ability to take a fantastic story and destroy it. Next time maybe he should read the book first. It's almost as bad as John Wayne doing Ghengis Khan.
1,DVD let down,"This dvd skipped, the volume dramtically fluctuated through out the movie. The disc actually stopped playing half way through the movie. Watch out! Do not buy from this seller. Buy a new dvd if you can."
2,This is Alan Rickman's Movie,"I give this movie two stars but Alan Rickman's performance five stars. I have heard for many years that the only reason to watch this movie is to catch Alan Rickman's performance. Boy, is that the truth. His character is so alive compared with the rest of the cast (except for Morgianna, who was also good). This is a pretty standard script, one could guess what would happen at every turn. Kevin Costner is so hit or miss with his movies, and this was definitely a big miss for him. Morgan Freeman is truly wasted. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character is tough girl one minute and screaming helpless girl the next. The writer's could not seem to make up their minds regarding what they wanted her to do. I found myself fast forwarding to any scene with Alan Rickman in it. He is completely over the top, hilarious, horrible and sympathetic. You feel the movie let down when he is not on the screen."
1,Now It's Even Longer??,I'm not one to launch gratuitous slams of Kevin Costner and I've enjoyed most of his stuff but this movie takes 'interminable' to new dimensions. I can't begin to imagine why anyone would want to make it even longer as it is one of the most insufferably boring movies I've ever seen.
3,Buy it if you are an Alan Rickman fan,"The movie is o.k.,except for Alan Rickman!! This man is so good in evil roles!! I just watch it to only see him!! It's one of those movies where you watch if you are bored and don't have nothing to do. If the movie did not have Alan Rickman, I would only rate it two stars!"
4,"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.",I simply love this movie which is anotherversion of Robin Hood's novel.I highly recommend it to people wholike adventure movies !!
3,2 sided movie,Quick delivery. Unfortunately it's a two sided disc. One side has 75 mins of the movie the other side has the remaining portion of the movie. Made watching the movie annoying bc you have to flip the disc halfway thru the movie.
1,"TWO SIDED DISC, REALLY?",In order to watch this you have to flip the disc mid way. I took the wrapper off and saw that on the insert. SO I sent it back
5,My fav,I use to love this movie when I was younger. Definitely one of my favorite Robin Hood Movies of all time
4,Doesn't include the Bryan Adams music video...,"Considering that I've actually seen DVDs selling for a ridiculous [amount] here, the price of this one is quite reasonable for DVDs sold in North America (you can get top quality DVDs in China for [money]). However, the ones who put this DVD together didn't do everything for you. For such an excellent movie, you don't get much on the DVD. You have to flip it over, because half the movie is on one side and half on the other. And, unlike the VHS, this one doesn't include the Bryan Adams music video of ""Everything I Do"", one of the Top 5 selling singles of English Pop Music in the 1990s. The resolution, though pretty good, is sub-standard for DVD and the sound gets distorted if you turn up the volume. An excellent movie but a bad DVD release."
2,One of the all time GREAT action-adventure films of all time,"What an unfortunate error on the part of Warner Bros to have put this great movie out in a single-layered format! They missed EVERY opportunity to make this the incredible movie-experience that it is! There is no DTS or 5.1 soundtrack, and you have to flip the DVD over at the half-way mark.If you have read through the other reviews posted here, please ignore the idiotic anti-American sentiments some obviously disturbed individuals put here for you to read - they missed the point of trying of help you decide if you should buy this DVD or not! My advice - dont. Not until they fix this particular release. Get the VHS version and ""rough it"" until then....END"
1,Two-sided?,"This review is purely about the DVD, not the movie. It's an old run, and hence is a two-sided disc. Given that, the transfer is good, but it's time to update the edition with a multilayered disc.Additionally, there are no extras with this edition.My advice is to wait for another edition."
1,This DVD does not work!,"This DVD only plays until chapter 17, about half way through the movie. There is no way to skip or fast forward. There are no more available chapters in the scene selection menu.We decided to buy another copy, because we thought we received a defective DVD, but the second copy had the exact same problem. This is horrible quality control. They are selling a product that is a complete waste of money!"
2,Looks Terrible!,"Great movie, horrible quality dvd. Grainy, terrible picture. Never seen a dvd look this bad. I have lots of dvd's and none of them look like this."
1,HORRIBLE,This product is HORRIBLE! I recieved the DVD and it only has the first half an hour on the DVD and thats it! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
3,Half of the movie missing but not amazon's fault and easy refund,I must say that I have always loved this movie. Yes it's got really BAD acting by Costner (and what's up with the hair?!) but Alan Rickman steals the show anyway.The movie stopped half way thru as others have said. Nothing left on dvd. But I had already tried 2 copies from the $5 bin at Walmart and they did the same thing. Walmart refunded my money easily both times. I was surprised when the copy from amazon was the same. Amazon refunded my money easily also. Must be a bad lot. Never run across that before.
2,"Good service, poor dvd.","While I received the dvd very quickly in the mail, I am pretty disappointed in the dvd itself. To be such a short movie, you actually have to flip the dvd over half way through to finish watching it. That's right. Flip it over to finish watching it. Like I said, I'm very pleased with the speed of the delivery, and will order from them again. Perhaps next time I will splurge for the $10 dvd and get better quality."
1,Cheap Hollywood Ruins A Bluray!,You have to turn this Bluray Dvd over during the movie!This ruins the whole experience of the movie! Unbelievable! BUYER BEWARE!
1,"Horrible, very Disappointing","I guess I now see why it was only $4.99 for this DVD. I received this and it was only half of the movie! It stopsHalfway through, and only let's you start the movie over again; there is no second half of the movie. Even if youTry to skip to the scenes option from the menu. There are only three scenes sequences to skip through. What a ripoff!"
4,A litttle to much,the acting was over the top at times but the story was great. Needed a better play on words to get it another star enjoyable but just missing tha t extra star zing.
4,"The best remake, so far",My husband and I are retired and we have been trying to switch our VCR;s to DVD's. Robin Hood was one of our favorites and we immediatley watched it.
3,for 12 year olds,I rember just loveing this movie when I was 12. As an adult it is kind of stupid. It is kind of funny though.
5,Good movie,If it wasn't for hubby I wouldn't have this movie added to my collection of dvd's. I can't even name how many Robin Hood movies we have. Or like Robin Hood movies. One that I enjoy is Robin Hood Man In Tights. When ever I watch Robin Hood Princes of Thieves I always think something funny is about to happen. Specially the scenes with the Sheriff and the Witch. The way they act it takes me back to the funny movie Robin Hood Man In Tights. I keep waiting for the funny lines. But it never happens. This is still a good movie.
1,confused,"I love this movie and always have. I was just trying to replace my vhs version with a dvd. The disc states that the movie is on one side and the extras are on the other. That's normal, however, upon wathcing the movie I found that 1/2 the movie and the extras are on side one and the second ahlf is on side two. I have to flip the dvd over part way through the movie. I'm not particularly happy... I hope it's a mistake on the manufacturer's part."
4,Still entertaining despite some so-so acting,"What can I say: Costner is Costner no matter what movie he's in - all his characters act the same because he's one dimensional. Morgan Freeman is always good, but I'm not too sure he was really meant to play a Moor with an accent. Nevertheless, in revisiting this ""oldie"" (unless you're in your 30s or older, then this is just an ""older"" movie) I was really entertained. And it was kind of fun to watch the guy that goes on to play Snape in the Harry Potter flicks as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. This one has good action, some drama and a sprinkle of romance. It was longer than I remembered from years ago and could probably have been edited a little to shorten the length, but still a good movie to escape the real world for a few hours."
4,Robin hood review,"This movie, Robin hood is personally one of my favorites. I'm a big Kevin Costner fan so it came on to me natuarlly. I also am very interested in the day of Robin Hood. I give it four stars out of 5 because of action and well supported acting. I thought the sheriff was played well"
3,Good Stuff!,"Prince of Thieves was MEANT to be entertaining nothing more. Purists should stick with Basil Rathbone and Company. My two problems with this version are the witch and the attempted rape scene. Brian Blessed did an exceptionally wonderful job as Robin's Father, pity he died early on.Morgan Freeman, Kevin Costner, Mary Elizabeth and of course Sean Connery were the backbone of this film. I had a great time watching it!"
2,fun movie--lousy DVD!,"I'll admit it--this movie is one of my ""guilty pleasures"". Never mind that Kevin Costner's performance as Robin Hood won't make anyone forget Errol Flynn. The rest of the cast is great--especially Alan Rickman, and this particular take on the story is very entertaining. My problem is that whoever designed the DVD version must be related to the woman who designed the presidential ballot in Palm Beach County!! Whoever you are, having a movie divided by two sides went out with LP albums and laserdiscs! Sure, there are DVD's with material on both sides of the disc--in most cases, it's two different versions of the same movie. It can be be widescreen/pan & scan or original version/director's cut. The point is that I don't know anyone who enjoys getting up in the middle of a movie to flip the disc over--that's why laserdiscs never enjoyed a lot of popular acceptance! It would be nice if this movie could be re-released on a DVD that is not designed like a butterfly ballot!!"
4,great movie!,"i loved this movie! and who cares about the accent anyway? not me! the witch needed to go, that was the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. but this movie is still my favorite!"
2,Have to flip the DVD!,"I love this movie but I'm very disappointed that when it reaches chapter 17, the movie stops! You then have to get up and flip the DVD over to be able to watch the rest of the movie on the other side of the disc!"
2,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"As I was watching the movie with my hubby, the DVD first of all did not have a Label which was strange. I have never encountered that before. All my previous orders with AMAZON of NEW CD's or NEW DVD's have always been Superb, except for this one. There was no label on the DVD, and the movie looked old and not crisp at all. I thought something was different but I put it on anyway and at the middle of the movie after the scene where the obesed priest is kidnapped and taken to Sherwood Forest and Lady is about to see Robin Hood taking a bath in the waterfall, then kaput. It ends! What!? Never have I ever experienced this, not even when I have bought used ones. It was very disappointing. I am sending it back today in hopes to receive either Full REFUND OR another NEW DVD of the sam movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, with Kein Costner. I love all his movies. Hopefully this situation will be resolved quickly.Sincerely,Irma Anaya"
3,Good job !,"I enjoyed that movie, specially on a Panasonic 50 ''. The video transfer on blue-ray was well done. Except for few scenes, grains was not visible. The black point is the purchase of the movie. The price I paid AMAZON is in my wiew exhorbitant...."
1,Poor blu-ray transfer,"I love the movie, but this is just another Warner Brothers standard DVD transfer. Says 1080p HD on the case, but it is just barely better than original DVD. Not even close to being on par with newer blu-ray DVD's. Save your money and wait for a digitally remastered version in HD. Hang onto your old DVD, I didn't."
1,A Big let down....,A big fan of the theatrical release. I wish both versions of the movie were on the disc. Sometimes these movies are edited well from the start and that has been the case with this movie. It wears a little long and has some pacing issues that the original did not. Some of the edited scenes drastically effect the movie and I felt in a very negative way. I have the original version on DVD and will continue to watch it rather than this one. On top of that their is very little in extras on the bluray. Just some different commentaries. So its a lose lose for me. Its a shame too. I wanted the original film only in better quality.
3,"Blu-Ray Is Kind Of Grainy, But An Improvement Over The Old DVD Release.","The Blu-Ray is kind of grainy, but it suites an HDTV more than the double-sided DVD does. The old DVD release is not enhanced for a widescreen TV. I prefer this Blu-Ray, I got rid of the old DVD."
1,Great Movie - Horrible DVD,"I wished I had peaked at the reviews. I had NO idea that this movie, in DVD form, was split! You have to flip the DVD over to watch the rest of the movie. I was SHOCKED! I thought I was safe purchasing a film that I know and love but I was not. This COMPLETELY RUINS the entire viewing experience!"
1,A Pitiful DVD for a Great Movie,"Having loved the Robin Hood movie when it came out, and been one of the first to buy it on VHS, I was looking forward to the DVD quality. Alas, this DVD is poorly-done in almost every way. The movie is split halfway through--you literally have to flip the DVD over to see the second part of the movie, although nothing tells you so or prompts you for it--the Supplemental Features are disappointing (and frequently error-laden), and there's truthfully no reason to buy this DVD if you have the VHS already (or a poorly-recorded copy from off the air). The studio really dropped the ball on this one; they need to re-master the DVD. Don't waste your money."
1,Pirated DVD - Do not buy,"You have to flip the DVD over halfway through, can't rip it, it is a pirated DVD and no one should buy it. Also it is lousy video quality."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This movie appears to be a bootlegged copy... Didn't have the FBI warning at the beginning. Also, the picture is very very grainy. You would be better off recording it from t.v., if you can find it. Very disappointing."
5,Best Movie Ever,"Despite the criticism this movie has received, it's still quite fun and memorable. Costner's portrayal of Robin Hood may not have been the classic outgoing charismatic, though he brought a charm and magnetism to the role that made up for anything lacking."
2,Poor acting and script,"I did not enjoy this movie, in the least. First, in the title role, Kevin Costner is miscast. Costner does well when he plays the all-American type, but he is truly awful here. It's not just his lack of a convincing English accent (although even a college drama student could do a better one!) but he is just not convincing as a swash-buckler type. Pierce Brosnan, for example, would have made a much better Robin Hood. I also disliked the way that the Christian worldview and church were portrayed, as backward, anti-science, ignorant, and hypocritical. This was done in 2 ways- by portraying Friar Tuck as a worthless drunkard, and glorifying Morgan Freeman's Moslem character. This is truly a distortion of history, and took the movie into the realm of political correctness."
1,Can't watch this movie!!,I got this movie for my special needs son - it is one of his favorites that he loves to watch when we go to a friends home. I was not aware that it was in another format that is not typically used in this country. He could not watch it and now I'm stuck with it - disappointment all around! Anyone in the market for it??????
2,Misled and ignored,"I purchased a DVD that was advertised as ""factory sealed"" and ""new"". When I received it, it was indeed in what looked like a factory sealed case. However, when I opened it, it had a scratch that ran along the last 3 chapters on side one. I have e-mailed the seller and have not yet received a response 2 months later. I am very disappointed and upset, especially since this was a gift from my son to his dad."
1,Scratches in a new DVD,"I can't reccommend Robin Hood because my NEW movie has scratches in it, and will only play to a certain point, and then just stops.Be careful when you buy DVD's from Amazon. I bought ""new"", so how could it be scratched?"
2,Features review: What is vintage?,"I am a disappointed with this release. It seems to boasts so much about a picture transfer and new DTS sound. The picture quality remains poor and the sound nothing more than just normal 5.1 sound. As regards the wonderful documentary about Robin Hood the extras are unnecessary and irrelevant. The so called ""vintage"" interviews should not be added. It seems that the producers have dug up all they have and just filled up the DVD just as an excuse to cash in on a few bucks. The extended scenes were clearly taken out in the original movie to add pacing to the movie. Hence the added scene slowed the picture down. The movie on the other hand is fantastic. Brilliantly directed! Alan Rickman is ALAN RICKMAN. There is no one who can play a villain you love to hate. The man is ""vintage""...what the producers called ""vintage"" is but to me [fluff]. Now Alan is VINTAGE......"
3,Costner - eh... Rickman-Bravo,"Costner needs a personality. The performance is flat.Now Alan Rickman, on the other hand, WOW! Buy the DVD just to watch a real actor work (forget Costner). Rickman has long been a terrific character actor. In Robin Hood, he really shines. He is both funny and terrifying. I find myself almost rooting for The Sheriff!"
2,Lovely villians,"Kevin Costner was just plain awful in this movie. How un-Robin like can you get? Of course I was spoiled by Howard Pyle illustrations, but when I first saw this movie at the age of twelve I was shocked most by the fact that he didn't even have a beard!!! I thought it was lousy, then years later I watched it again and noticed just how funny Alan Rickman and Micheal Wincott were in it as the villians. The ""why a spoon"" dialogue is truly brilliant (well, almost). Alan Rickman really dominates this film with his hilarious performance. He looks like he was having lots of fun. I only give it two stars for the lousy performances of the rest of the cast, and because they killed off Guy of Gisborne way too soon."
4,Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves CD,we recieved our CD quickly and are pleased with it. You must stop and turn the CD over to watch the second half of the movie.We are puzzled by this. Grandsons liked the movie.
5,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,I have a bone to pick with you!! I paid $14.99 (RobinHood: Price of Thieves) for this movie and it has sub-titles on the whole movie. I tried to remove them and no soap. So whatever vendor you have in your list that sent this moive to me should make this moive good and send me another one without sub- titles. I also have two others I purchased from you with the same problem. The Long Kiss Goodnight and Sense and Senisbility.Can you do anything about this?Carole Norris queenbee149@comcast.net
1,didn't work,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It was a favorite of his years ago. He played it that night and it got to chapter 17 and it just stopped. The ending wasn't there. So we got another sent to us and the same thing happened again!!
2,bad dvd.,I've brought this dvd and it play half way and stopped I sent it back and it did the same thing.
1,Unhappy,"This product was poor quality, and didn't play past the 17th chapter - halfway through the movie. I will be returning."
4,"Great, but long","As with many Costner Films this one is very well done, but I can see that because of it's length that many may not like it so well. This movie however never really drags too much like some of his films. It is because of the Details that he considers important. I liked it very much as with most of his movies."
4,Cheesy but good for a rainy afternoon!,This is not the best of the Robin Hood movies (think Errol Flynn...way better) but it is more modern and has Kevin Costner which is enough for some people. Personally I am and always will be a Morgan Freeman fan so this was great fun to watch as his character is definately more likable then anything Kevin Costner could come up with (real or fictional...sorry Kev.) This is a great movie for slumming around on a rainy afternoon when you've got nothing else to do and it is definately kid friendly!
2,Kevin Costner: Prince of ..Meh.,"You know what I'm talking about; ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring Errol Flynn. Comparing that classic film with this Costner drek is like comparing ""Road Warrior"" with......""Water World""? The Flynn version is fun and light hearted. It has a great score and incredible colors. Costner's version is only pandering to modern sensibilities.C'mon, the movie reeks of political correctness Maid Marion fighting in black armor? Great a strong female character, Morgan Freeman as Robin's sidekick? Hey, the wise token ethnic character.(Sorry Morgan,you were good, but unnecessary)Christian Slater? Stick him in for more youth appeal. This movie adds nothing really to the Robin Hood mythos. If you must watch it, fast forward through any parts that don't feature Morgan Freeman or Alan Rickman."
1,Half of the Movie is Missing!,"I thought 5 bucks was a bargain for this movie, but it's just a cheap copy with half of the movie missing."
2,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"I have to say, I did not really like this movie at all. I bought it because it was on sale at the local movies store and I am interested in Robin Hood. I just did not like it. Costner's accent was horrible, should have gotten a British actor to play the part. The plot was not at all that good. It was more Hollywood than Robin Hood. I am sad I bought it. It was a waste of money."
3,quality of dvd,"although this is a brand new dvd, the clarity of the entire movie was spotty in certain scenes. also the movie stopped at a specific scene without completing the movie. when the situation of scene stoppage i realized that i had to eject the dvd and turn the dvd over to complete movie by reloading. there was no notice or printing on the dvd that i would have to eject and reload to watch the completed movie.i am very disappointed in the quality of this dvd and feel that i have wasted my money on the purchase."
1,DVD would not work,Apparently there is a bad batch of DVDs for this movie. I ordered the first one and it played until a certain point in the movie then jump back to the scene selection screen. Sent back to Amazon got replacement. Same thing happened. So decided to order from another vendor. Same thing happened with their movie too. I know it is not my dvd player because all my other movies play fine plus I tried playing Robin Hood dvds on my other player and same thing happened. So now I have two bad dvds and I am out about 10 bucks. Afraid to reorder for fear of getting yet another bad dvd from this defective batch.
4,Loses one star for the DVD,"and thats because you have to flip to the other side to watch the other half of the film, which is kinda annoying. As far as the movie is concerned, I really enjoy this movie. It captures the essence of adventure and heroics as well as any Ive seen, along with a nice sense of humor. Many didnt like Costner because of his unconvincing accent, but I really didnt care. He did a great job and so did the rest of the cast. Rickman was a scene stealer as the nasty Nottingham, too. The production is great, the music, the direction and a refreshing twist on the Robin Hood mythology. When I saw this at the theater, the crowd was cheering constantly and I still feel the same way watching it. The only drawback is the double sided DVD. Please correct this and also give it the proper aspect ratio of 2.35-1, since that is how it was originally shown. Buy it, sit back and enjoy."
3,"Entertaining, not very accurate","This is a costume drama, plain and simple. If you park your brain, this movie is a lot of fun. Of course, Hollywood being Hollywood, the movie abounds with historical inaccuracies--gunpowder? Moors in England?--but it's gorgeously filmed. Kevin Costner is his usual deadpan self (and after a while just abandons any attempts at a British accent), but it's Alan Rickman's hilarious performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham that makes this movie watchable. Rickman was robbed of an Oscar nomination that year--yes, he's that good. A nice vegging-out-with-the-Haagen-Dazs movie, and Costner looks pretty decent in tights as well . . ."
5,Wiggles Fan,"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES the Wiggles. I have had to add more and more Wiggles DVD's to our collection to keep ME from getting bored with the same old one over and over (and over and over!). Both of these are fun to watch and feature some of our favorite songs (no ""Little Wiggles"" or animated Wiggles which we don't really care for as much). My husband and I are pretty big Wiggles fans too so we don't mind watching the DVD's along with our son - plus it can be good aerobic exercise too! :-)"
2,Cork Screw Failure,"Unlike the other reviewers, my Kitchenaid cork screw worked fine for almost two years. It never quite pulled the cork far enough out of the bottle to suit me -- it didn't make cork pulling labor-free -- but I found it much easier than any previous such tool I ever owned. Alas, as in many of the other reviews, the screw finally broke off in a cork and the device seems irreparable. A cheap plastic cork screw had to be called into service. I just visited the Kitchenaid web page and they don't offer a cork screw for sale anymore. I presume that I will soon toss mine as well. Planning to buy one of these for $30? Clint would ask you: Do you feel lucky?"
1,Negative Stars!,"I purchased this corkscrew only one month ago, expecting it to be a lifetime lasting product. WRONG! The corkscrew broke off while we were opening a bottle ~ the screw coming off in the cork, remaining beyond repair. What a horrible product!"
1,kitchenaid corkscrew,Super heavy duty looking but broke after 9 uses. The actual corkscrew broke off of the main shaft. Exceptionally poor design.
1,"Looks nice, but don't try using it on flanged bottles","Works fine for standard style bottles, but the collar actually cracked when using it to open a 1.5 liter bottle with a flanged top. Poor design...I'm still nursing a painful finger that got pinched in the cracked collar."
1,Duped !!!,"I should have known better purchasing any video of this series , but curiosity overruled my brain . The so- called facts were flimsy and I questioned the validity of the interviewed experts . Don't waste your time or money with this video ."
2,Kinda a waste of money... but OK,"I bought Watches 1, and I really liked it. I really enjoyed seeing how UFOs and other things that are happening a lot today, seem to portray the soon return of Jesus Christ. The entire video was pretty good but, sadly what I just said, I really mean about Watchers 1... Watchers 2 seemed to me, to be basically a replay of Watchers 1, with a little more stuff added. I am glad I bought the very cheap download version from Amazon, to me, the DVD price would of been a waste of money."
3,Good but not great,Interesting movie but it the quality of the film and production could have been much better. Take a look if like alien UFO type of shows where they investigate strange happenings.
1,Terrorists Among Us,"Was not impressed. The movie ""Obsession"" was much better, covered more ground and had better research."
2,Songs sounded better live than on CD,"Living in the Buffalo area, 54-40 has performed many times in what has become their home away from home, and they have consistently been a great and energetic live act to see. The last show that they played here was free, and they showcased more than a half-dozen songs off of their newest disc, all of which sounded great and made me anticipate hearing what I believed would be their strongest disc in years. For some reason, the studio versions of what sounded so promising live do not transcend well on disc. The CD itself is very straight-forward and rather ""lost and lazy"". There is certainly nothing new here, and many songs resemble past hits that were done way way better in their original form. Perhaps it takes a few listens to have it grow on you, but as it is now, I would have to say that there is not one song that holds a candle to previous 54-40 staples, like ""Casual Viewing"", ""Since When"", and ""One Gun""."
2,Not worth what it cost,"This is a pretty good CD only because of ""Easy To Love"". I don't think the CD is worth $28.00 and some odd cents for one song. All the other songs sound the same."
1,misrepresented,this is not a fogger as advertised! it's more of a spray. i was looking for an outdoor fogger such as the indoor foggers BUT FOR THE YARD. after spraying the foundation----i did not have any to spray the yard and noticed that i still had a cricket chirping later in the day :(
2,Wrong book,I received it fast but it was the wrong book. There was no image so I got the wrong manuel.
1,Very disapointed with the seller. Nothing but trouble.,"First off, the book is in good condition. The problem I had was with the seller. FIRST OFF he sent the book to the wrong person and sent their book to me. It was no problem at first, and we made a plan to fix it. I did not receive the book for over a month after ordering it. The seller was hard to get ahold of, and did not follow up daily like he said he would do. After 2 weeks of not receiving the book, he should have done something (sent another book)and requested that this book be returned to him. I did get 50% off, but I am still very disapointed. SECONDLY: It is not the book that is posted for sale on Amazon. I received the instructors manual, and not the student copy. Attention to detail is my only bit of advise. This order has been nothing but trouble."
4,A well-crafted homage to classic country of yesteryear,"A sweet tribute to the heyday of the heart song, that style of weepy ballads perfected in '40s and '50s and '60s by the likes of Webb Pierce, Kitty Wells and George Jones. First off, I love the graphics (an homage to the Columbia label's late 'Fifties look, back when Carl Smith was top of their country roster...) and the liner notes are a hoot, too -- a witty takeoff on the pretentiously written, pseudo-intellectual ""essays"" Nashville used to slap onto their LPs. Best of all, Armstrong backs up his obvious love for the style with a lot of talent, especially as a songwriter. All twelve tracks on here are original compositions, written with an intentionally old-time feel. The material ranges from goofy Howard Harlan-style paradox tunes (""Looking Forward To Looking Back"") to abject weepers and loser tunes galore. The production is a little uneven, but the material is great."
3,Best Of???,"I wish I noticed it was a best of beforeI bought it. I've never been impressed bybest of C/D's. It's alway's been like,""WHO PICKED THESE SONG'S, AND WHY?"" Outof 15 song's, 6 may-be, 7. The rest areto slow. Boring even. Don't get me wrong,I like Walter, but do yourself a favor andskip this one."
2,Not Blues,I wasn't sure that I would like the album but took the chance and bought it anyway. I was very pleased when the album started off with some very nice slide and harp. After the first 30 odd seconds in changed into something else that was tolerable. It was all down hill after the first track a track that could loosely be called blues after the opening moments. Not sure how you could place this in the Blues genre. THIS ALBUM IS NOT BLUES.
2,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""DON'T CAST YOUR LINE FOR THIS TROUT!""","As Shaq, ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", said in a prior 5 star rated review on Walter's, ""Full Circle"", I had never heard of him before. ""Full Circle"" was so good, I decided to ""reverse engineer"" him, and research and find some prior CD's of him. This CD was a result of my effort. I was totally disappointed. This CD can't hold an unlit candle to the blues-rock classic that ""Full Circle"" is. Shaq's recommendation to my loyal ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"" fans, is to not buy this, and hope Walter's new direction, is the type of heavy hitting blues classic that ""Full Circle"" is. I am anxiously awaiting his next release, and will update you immediately upon that event!"
2,Economists approach but Porter is better,"I bought this book because I was hoping it would provide me with good guidance in terms of how to use analysis techniques that would support my strategy consulting work. It has a heavy economists' leaning. This is both good and bad. It is good in that it gives some tried and true ways of understanding contemporary strategy. It is bad in that it misses out on the many ways and means by which non-economists understand contemporary strategy and is very thick in terms of its descriptions. It is not a ""how to"" book, that is for sure. Since competition today often seems to defy economic logic, this economic approach can only go so far. And there is still no better economist's approach than Professor Michael Porter's materials and this book certainly adds little to that great body of work."
4,A concrete book on a difficult topic,"There are many books on strategy that stimulate deep thinking and as many with a strictly case oriented approach. The Grant's book is well-ordered and clear, and you have a clear feeling you are reading someone who has practicely worked in the real world using the concepts explained."
4,Best book to learn global strategies,"Very useful textbook used in many MBA courses. If you're starting to learn strategies first time, this book is the most useful. It contains many basic informations and global cases also."
2,Informal Tone and Rather Strangely Written,"If you were to write a book on business strategy, what examples would you use on page 1 to illustrate successful strategy? If you are Robert M. Grant, you would sing the praises of Madonna, the communist north Vietnamese army, and Lance Armstrong. Likewise, how would you explain diversification? If you are Robert M. Grant, you would say ""Diversification is like sex: its attractions are obvious, often irresistible. Yet, the experience is often disappointing."" (Page 409) These are but two examples of the author's odd writing style. However, if these examples of business strategy appeal to you, this is your book."
4,Good value!,"The quality is good and the price is very good. I'm happy with it and with the quick shipping.Updated review 11/2/2011 It's held up well, and I'm considering buying another soon."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,"This product looked so lovely on line, I just couldn't wait to receive and so far I am still waiting for it to arrived. I have e-mailed the sender on several occassion and yet I have not received my Chef Jacket."
3,Good but needs to fix errors,"I found this book very pleasant to read; the practice questions at the end of each chapter are very interesting and encourages deep thoughts and further reading. However, the book contains quite a few errors, mostly typos , and I found the logic of particular chapters difficult to follow (for example, the narration jumps from one topic to another with only loose connection, as if it was merely for bringing up the unrelated but important topic). Overall I feel this book is entertaining to read, but contains errors that need to be fixed."
3,"Fantastic bag for an apartment, but it leaks water and does move with hard kicks and punches.","First of all, I love having this bag in my apartment. Being able to train with full power attacks without having to go to the gym is amazing. But the product is not without problems. I wanted to fill the base with sand, but the local Home Depot was out of sandbags (how do you run out of sandbags?). Anyway, I filled it with water, which I don't recommend. With a really hard kick, the unit will tip and water spills out from the cap. You can decrease the likelihood of this happening by filling the base with less water, but then it only moves around more. Also, when I use it, the entire apartment shakes, which the neighbors love. So it's definitely something to be used during the day. To sum up, its a good product for the price, and I don't know of any alternative. So I recommend it, but suggest filling the base with sand or some other solid material. Happy training."
5,Takes a lot of punishment,"My daughter took Krav Maga (Israeli army-style hand-to-hand) and needed a punching bag to keep in shape and maintain training. It had to be indestructible for her (she is fierce & merciless), but I didn't want anything that had to be mounted to the ceiling or walls. The Century XXL Wavemaster is perfect. Her older sisters (one has taken Judo and the other is just plain mean), football friends, cousins - everybody likes giving it their best shot. It stays in place and takes a lot of punishment. Great product!"
1,Poorly designed training bag,"Every time I punch or kick the bag, the damn thing dumps over. I filled the base with sand....it dumped over. Added water in addition to the sand for more weight....Dumped over. Absolutely useless for anyone who knows how to punch or kick. The only way to stabilize the bag is to have someone stand behind it and hold it. The bag itself is far too light (fill with foam pool noodles...What's up with that???). The base is too narrow. I wasted $250."
3,Pretty fair substitute,"For an inanimate ""sparring partner"" nothing beats a good hanging heavy bag, but if one has no place or means to hang a heavy bag then this is a decent substitute.Complaints: One, it isn't near as firm as a heavy bag -- almost like punching a big pillow. Works okay for speed and form, but doesn't assist much with developing power.Two,it moves around too much. (Advice -- fill the bottom with sand instead of water).Otherwise, it's okay for a home gym with limited options."
4,Training bag,Love my bag it's the best...can't wait to put my gloves on and kick and punch that thing after a day from Hell!!!
5,Good bag,"Wife loves the bag. Easy to move, stays put, and easily assembled/disassembeld as needed. Would recommend to other people who are looking to have a good bag to punch/kick."
4,Great product,We are very happy with the training bag. It was delivered in two boxes and was easy to install. We purchased the sand and filled it using a funnel. Very quick set up.
3,Good Product,"I use the bag for cardio kickboxing. The bag can take the hits pretty good, although the impact is different from a hanging bag. The bag also moves quite a bit, but I have only tried it with water in the base may be sand will be better. Overall, it a pretty good substitute for those people who can not hang a bag at their place."
5,great start for your basic workouts!,"this bag has been fantastic from the jump! it arrived on schedule and i filled it up the first night (sand). absorbs kicks, jabs and straights pretty well. my only problem is that it's not great for hooks, knees or uppercuts but that's ok because i knew what i was getting when i bought it. you can work on basic combinations and technique and it's great for cardio. it moves around a bit when hit but that's actually a fantastic way to keep your feet working. all in all it's better than the liquid core bag a thought about purchasing originally. awesome buy and worth every penny. my girlfriend and kids even like working with it!"
3,Kind of dissapointing,"I bought this bag and I was going to put it out in my garage and I just got it today but the only problem is that it came without the bottom part that the bag actually go's into, now do I need to get one it did it come with one is my only question."
5,Very solid.,"Just got this bag about a month ago and so far I am pleased. It is a very large sturdy bag and has been able to take any punch or kick that I have thrown at it. I was looking for something to use mostly for stomp heel and toe kicks, this is perfect, my Bob XL would fall down with these kicks, but this bag is more bottom heavy and will only tip over if all the sand moves to one side, and even with that it barely tips over. One negative is that the unit will slide on hard floors and even on some mats, you need to find a good mat that has more of a non slip surface."
3,worth the money,"Great price, the upper punching unit seems to be a little wobbly where the upper pad meets the base unit."
3,"Missing a part, but a great buy!","Firstly, this bag is awesome and all of my students love it! It would have been 5 stars except:I purchased two and one came missing the cap to the base. It's been 3 weeks and still no response from Amazon."
3,Good but not heavy enough,"The product was shipped ahead of schedule always a good thing. Assembly was easy;I chose to fill it with sand vs water, five 50lb bags. As advertised this brought the weight to about 270plus pounds. Yet the weight is not enough to keep the bag from being tipped over. I was able to knock it over with a fairly moderate punch and a kick blasts it to the floor without trying. I have to resort to just using the bag for speed drills vs power drills. So in short this is not a heavy bag for adults with any true power behind them as advertised. So I kept it for my up and coming students to practice their power hits."
3,Good bag but no base?,"I bought this bag to help me improve my kickboxing techniques, upon arrival there was no base for my bag, only the bag itself. awesome bag if I actually could use it."
5,Always makes me laugh,This has always been a favorite movie of mine. Makes me laugh so hard every time I watch it. Arrived in great condition.
1,"Soylent Dick Says: Aweful Movie, Aweful Plot","A totally absurd movie with a ridiculous premise. And to think that someone got paid to produce this drivel. We are not allowed to swear on this site, so I'll have to content myself with the following: This movie would have to be the worst *swear word* *swear word* I have ever come across."
1,cant review until i receive the dvd.,was told that this dvd was shipped on the 3rd sept and yet it has not arrived. normally my dvd's arrive within 10 days so thinking we have a problem with this shippment.
1,"Weekend at Bernie's dvd, new",PRODUCT IS DAMAGED. DOES NOT PLAY PROPERLY DURING LAST 15 MINUTES OR SO OF THE MOVIE. I AM QUITE UPSET.
4,"Weekend at Bernie's - a macabre, slapstick sort of thing, but very funny.","Weekend at Bernie's - a macabre, slapstick sort of thing, but very funny. My son loved it as a teenager, so what does that tell you? However, I laughed through it as well, and I'm a woman over 50. By the way, I am NOT a 3-stooges fan."
3,Some 80s movies shouldn't be rewatched,"Even though the seller had this video delivered quickly and the product was in great shape, I was disappointed with how terrible the acting and storyline were in this movie. some 80s movies shoul NOT be rewatched."
2,Dances across the line between dumb and funny.,"""Weekend at Bernie's"" was never meant to be anything more than a collection of gags built around the thinnest of plots.Even so, the execution is wildly inconsistent, but steadily improves as the film progresses. Indeed, dumb and funny are separated by a thin line, and Ted Kotcheff's effort hops back and forth, leaving the viewer alternatingly snickering and groaning. However, the last half hour is pretty funny, if not predictable. The boat ride in particular was hilarious.Overall, a less-than-spectacular work, but entertaining enough."
3,"Funny, but not to be taken seriously","The characters are thin, the plot is simple, but the movie works if you understand that it wasn't meant to be on par with ""Casablanca"".I laughed more than once watching the two bumbling protagonists avoid death by trying to convince everyone that Bernie was still alive (with often unexpected results). It was funnier to watch the frustrated Mafia hit man repeatedly try to kill the already dead Bernie.Some of my friends found this movie offensive because of the supposed disrespect for the dead all throughout it, and after a while it does get a little old. This is, after all, a one-joke movie. However, others, like myself, laughed because it was so obvious that it wasn't to be taken seriously one single bit.And that's the key with this movie. If you're in the mood to laugh at something goofy, stay up late with a group of friends and enjoy it."
5,Murder Mystery Comedy,"This is a funny movie about two co-works and a murder.The antics these two go through, are laughable.McCarthy and Silverman play off each otherscharacter very well!. Also Weekend at Bernie's 2is a great follow up movie. They use the sameactors and actress, which continues the samelively and flowing chemistry. A must have foryour DVD collection.Thank You"
4,Still funny after all these years.,I hadn't seen this since it came out and was pleased to find it as silly and fun as the first time around.
4,it was a good movie,It was a good movie. There were parts to took a while before any comedy but not a bad movie.
4,"Dark Comedy, Light Fun","The cast is perfect and the sets, music, and all that went into this movie seem to meld to make a very funny movie. Andrew McCarthy as Larry Wilson and Jonathan Silverman as Richard Parker are a good match for co-workers at an insurance company. Larry the brown nosing party man and Richard the hard working nerd. When Richard discovers a two million dollar mistake in claims their boss Bernie invites them over for the weekend to discuss it. What happens after that is sick, demented, and funny. Any fan of ""8 Heads in a Duffel Bag"" and ""The Whole Nine Yards"" should enjoy it. This is one of those rare movies were seeing a dead person being lugged around, beat up, dropped, bareface ski, washed around in the tide, shot, strangled, and more is just plain outrageously funny."
3,one of the funniest scenes ever...,"I wouldn't say that this movie is great, but it does contain one scene in particular that had me in tears. This one minute (or less) scene makes the movie worth owning. It comes when our 2 main characters panic because they think they are about to miss the fairy out to the island where Bernie lives..."
3,Mixed bag of movies,"Wow! This one is a mixed bag. On one hand you have a great film in Ed Gein, a scary almost too realistic take on Ed Gein's life and murders. Alas, on the other hand you have the other 3 movies which are not as good. You have the John Wayne Gacy film (with a cameo from Firefly co-star Adam Baldwin) which is very lame in it's delivery. You have the Jeffery Dhamer film, which is the least gory of the 4, it's mostly about his homosexual affairs and I really lost interest half-way through the film and the final film about Ted Bundy was just your standard serial killer movie.Overall this package gets a 3, for the fabulous Ed Gein and the nice digi-pack packaging. It's definitely worth the 7 dollar price tag."
3,Forensic Buff,Do not watch this alone or late at night. Definitely not for even 13 years of age. Probably are true stories but the things they did. It seems to take so long to get the bad guys.Please Amazon don't recommend this kind to me again. It was better to watch them on the news.
3,Orange not red,The coral is orange not red so it was not appropriate in my red decorated tank. I lost money on this one.
4,"Fascinating (mostly), but very hard","This is a collection of essays from various historians over the past 150 years, examining the historical basis of the the life of Muhammed, and -- essentially -- devastating it.There are two long introductory essays that must be read first. They provide some essential background and context. There is a glossary and an index of names. The essays provide a wide range of opinion and argument. I would have liked to have seen more modern stuff and a bit less Lammens.But this book is very hard indeed. (Do you know what irenic means?) Some of the essays are a bit dull too. Still, where else can the non-specialist go to find this stuff? Most worthwhile on balance."

1,"Can anyone say,.....bias?","Reading a book about Mohammad by Ibn Warraq is like reading a book about John Kennedy by Fidel Castro. Take a look on the web for Ibn Warraq and his anti-Muslim bias is clear.Whether sweet or bitter, truth is not something your likely to attain from someone with a clearcut agenda.But....hey, its your money :)"
1,Poor Scholarship,"Entirely one sided. He refuses to take in all possible accounts and tries -- and fails-- vehemently to paint an image that has already been conceived in his mind.This is of very poor scholarship, if one is even to label it scholarly, which would be paramount to a lie.Save yourself some time and money by investing in Karen Armstrong's book."
1,Pointless book of lies,"If this author uses the fact that most of the references on Muhammad's life were his followers as a reason to lie about him. Then what does that say about all the other prophets before him (e.g. Jesus, Moses, Abraham) that no proof is available that they ever lived.The only things written about Jesus were by his ""apostles"" and they were written centuries after his ""death"". I have yet to see any anti-Jesus books written by a Muslim. It just isn't in Islam's nature to put down Holy Prophets of God.Ibn Warraq should have used the pen name Iam ACrock"
5,Worth two,"Worth two? Yes, because this is my second purchase of a Simpletech SD card. This brand is not one of the least expensive, and it's for good reason. It's very dependable. I've never lost photo data; nor have I had any of them become corrupted. True, there are 1 gigabyte SD cards out right now, but having two 512 MB cards instead is not too bulky, anyway. Simpletech is a known quantity. Other brands aren't, and all I hear is how people have gotten defective cards from the other brands. Not Simpletech. This is my brand of choice. Can't wait for their 1 GB!"
4,A POET PUT TO MUSIC,"BAUDELAIRE is of course the father of modern FRENCH poetry.When i bought that record ,i didn't know what to expect.A poet put to music, this is suppose to be boring right?To my surprise, i liked it ,especially on the third listening, when i got deeper into understanding the poetry.This certainly won't make it with teenagers, and is not for everybody's taste. LEO FERRE has done similiar quality records, honouring other great FRENCH poets like VERLAINE,RIMBAUD,APPOLLINAIRE and ARAGON."
5,SignoRicci for Men,"This is a very refreshing eau de toilette. It can be used by females as well. It has a a citrusy smell, ideal for a summer's day ,it is however suitable all year round."
3,Be Aware of Hidden Subscription Costs!,"Lots of cool features listed on the box, right?-Import your own photo, add custom frames & medals you earn-Gain money, experience & level to unlock a wide variety of perks, features & prestige-Frequent tournaments... win tournaments for extra cash, experience points and prestige-Visit the casino mall to browse hundreds of items, open new games and decorate your suite-Acquire, disign and furnish your own suite, and show it off by hosting private games & tournamentsSounds fun, huh? But you get NONE of that unless you sign up for the additional cost of a monthly online subscription. That disclaimer is hidden at the bottom of the box in miniscule font."
2,Dull blades,"I received this product and was very disappointed with the quality of the blades. I even tried all of them and have been putting up with them for a while now, almost to the point where I forgot what using a sharp blade was like. This is a classic example of 'you get what you pay for'"
1,Totally worthless,My husband bought these to save money. They were totally worthless and a big WASTE of money instead. They were dull and wouldn't cut at all.
1,Poorly marked item,I was extremely upset when I received this package from Amazon. I specifically chose this vendor and this listing because it stated Mach Three Power and not Blades. However when I opened the package it was two packages of blades and no actual razor. I feel completely ripped off and will never purchase any type of bath product through this site again. I would rate this seller a 0/10 if given the opportunity.
1,very disappointed,"I believed that I had found a great bargain in these blades until they began to literally fall apart after one or a few shaves. I tried to put them back together at first but I've chalked this one up to ""if it seems to good to be true, it is"". Don't do it!!"
5,M3 Power-Gillette Replacement Cartridges,"I purchased the M3 Power-Gillette Replacement Cartridges, 16 Blades for my husband. He is really the one who's opinion matters... he was very pleased with his new razor and when it came time to purchase new cartridges we couldn't be more pleased with the speed of the shipment and the purchase price... beat out Walmart, and Target."
2,Good if you only want case studies,"Although the case studies were interesting I found that the author didn't tease out the lessons learned in a summation. I'm not sure what the key points were that I was supposed to walk away with.If anyone has a good reference on how adolescents learn, I would love to knowabbyremer@abbyremer.com"
5,A masterpiece of philosophy and scholarship,"I've used this text for some time in my undergraduate courses, with great success. Waterfield's translation is accurate and scholarly, and the introduction and notes make this edition a perfect introduction to Plato's philosophy.As for the value of the text itself, little needs to be said. Plato's Republic is one of the most important works in the history of philosophy, and every well-educated person ought to have read it at least once. There is some controversy among scholars over whether the work is primarily one of political philosophy or of moral psychology, but Plato perhaps did not draw these distinctions the way we do: one can certainly learn a great deal about both areas from reading this one work."
2,So sad...maybe next time,"Nothing stands out on this cd. Not good. It's very, very average. I'm glad that I wasn't the one to purchase this cd. I was ready to go out an get this but I lucked out. Oh well. Dru Hill still has a chance and hopefully they will do well enough to get the opportunity to try again. Oh and what's with the new member? I thought he was going to bring something new."
2,Long wait but for what,"After Sisqo rose to the top with chart toppers like ""THONG SONG""and sanked like the Titanic in his sopohmore album. The great return of the DRU was not great. Neither was the addition of the fifth wheel. What purpose does he serve. There are no true standout hits on this cd. Where is the ""Tell Me"", ""Somebodies Sleeping in My Bed, or the ""Beauty"" as a matter of fact where is the real ""DRU HILL"
3,I must say this isn't the old dru hill i expected..,"Dru World order doesn't have the same feel as the two previous albums. but that doesn't make it a flop, i just feel even with all the time they took off this album was rushed...maybe to ease fans minds or whatever, but i'm just feeling that the guys didn't put their whole hearts into this attempt. i can say that track #8 is one of my favorite off the cd besides the single i should be..but to me no other songs just really stands out and would make an awsome single, but i'm not too disapointed. i just thought they could have done better and maybe my expectations were too high. good try boys but i know you can do better. yet in still i'll always be a fan."
5,Dru Hill is BACK,"Every song on the album is good but there are 4 GREAT songs that should and probably will become hit singles.1. On Me is probably the best song on the album, it is the best song i have heard in a long time2. I Should Be is another great song it is more of a slow song3. I Love You is a good slow song4. I Do is also another good slow song"
4,Dru Hill is back!!!,"It has been long awaited, but those boys are back. Dru World Order is great. If you loved the first two, you will love this one. You have to check it out!!!"
4,A must have,"I really think the CD is great. Dru Hill is known for their ballads and as always, the ballads were so emotional. There is one song on there called ""I Do""(Millions)...that's going to be my wedding song one day:) The main thing I would like to point out is everyone has their chance in having a lead in some songs which I think is so wonderful because they all have great voices to me."
4,A Classic,"Since 1996 when I was in 10th Grade I have been a fan of the Dru Hill Family. The guys came on the scene as young upstarts and really may be the most talented R & B group since Jodeci or Boyz II Men. Ego's appear to have gotten in the way of the groups chemistry but the guys came back strong with a added member to show that these brothers could unite to make a hell of an album. Dru Hill are best when they croon and they have other writers and producers behind them. There early work had great production by Keith Sweat and Babyface and a new ear would have been great. The Bryan Cox track ""If I Could"" may the most overlooked song but it is awesome. The two up-tempo tracks (sisqo's influence) could have been over looked but overall the 2nd best Dru Hill album behind their debut ""Enter the Dru"""
2,Very weak & medicore album from a group capable of more,"Like many fans I eagerly awaited Dru Hill's Dru World Order,however I was very disapointed as the CD only has four tracks that really impress me. Two of those tracks were the singles I Should Be and I Love You. The only album tracks that impressed me were Xstacey Jones and Never Stop Loving You, other than that it's a filler album as the harmoines are weak and the singing is boring. Two things could have fixed this album the first being enlist better producers such as The Underdogs, Babyface and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Nokio produced over half the album, and much of the songwriting was kept in-house as well which was a mistake for the group. The second thing that could have fixed the album would have been a good cover song as I think Sisqo & Jazz could have easily killed Cameo's Why Have I Lost Your or Gentle by Fredick."
4,Great Jammin CD by a master,This was an impressive album to me. I always liked dru hill together rather then sisco on his own. If you like dru hill I would look up jaheim and tyresse as well.
2,...MAYBE NEXT TIME,"The idea of a ""reunion"" album was an exciting thought, but I just wasn't impressed. I thought maybe this one would grow on me, but after repeated listenings I had to give up hope. There are only about three good tracks on the CD including the first single ""I Should Be""."
3,NICE AND WELL DONE.,I CANT STOP LISTENING TO THIS CD. ITS A GOOD COMBAT FOR THEM. LOVE EVERY SONG ON THE CD AND LISTEN TO IT EVERY NIGHT. IF U GET IT U WONT BE MAD BOUT IT. IF U DONT HAVE IT THE GO AND GET IT.
5,"All I can say is, ""Dang!""","This album is off the hook. I love DruHIll anyway, but man. They done it again. You get to hear all of them on this album. All five! It's like a free gift. A new member! That helped set it off. I appreciate that they don't let just one person sing every song on the album, and give the others a hook every once in a while like some groups. 'i Do"" will make you say I do. ""Ishould BE"" Let me stop, this album is just tight. It got something for the playas, the religious, and the lovers. You can't beat that. Jam on DruHill! Jam on!"
1,Disappointed Dru Hill Fan,"I have been a fan of Dru Hill since ""96"". This album i was really disappointed. The best songs are ""I Should Be"", and "" I Love You."""
3,Not Their Best Album,"When I bought the CD, I was hoping for one of the best albums out now (Only due to the fact that Sisqo's solo career wasn't as good as expected, He's nothing without Dru Hill, and vice-versa) But I have to admit I was disappointed. I was expected alot of love songs that came from Enter The Dru, but there were only about 4 or 5 out of 13. ""I Should Be (steps)"" is the best song on the album, it is really a great song, but if only the rest of the songs were just as good. The only other track Ilike from the album were the last few. They reminded me of the Enter the Dru days with the nice slow ballads and Sisqo yelling his voice box out. They are pretty good songs, but as I said, I expected more. So if you are willing to listen to at least 5 songs on a 13 song album, then go ahead. Those five songs are really good."
1,A WASTE,IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE OLD DRU-HILL DON'T BUY THIS.THERE IS NOT ONE AND I MEAN 1 STANDOUT TRACK. I WISH I HADMY MONEY BACK.
3,Dru Hill are back!,"After Sisqo's failure with his last album he decided to make a album together with his old friend's of Dru Hill he had big success with before he went solo. As always you will get a smoth rnb album with both slow jams and up tempo with Dru Hill so i do rate them pretty attractive among the Rnb act out there. Soulish ""I should be"" is good also ""On Me"" with Noreaga, which is a little more of a party song. However there aintn that many hit songs on the album, many decent like ""No doubt"" and ballad ""I love you"" but none like ""How deep is your love"" and this album actually came out only one year after Sisqo's second solo album so they must have been working quite fast. I have defenitely heard better, but it's a quite good cd at the end. ""She said"" with Chinky is good, a remarkable ballad between her and Sisqo mostly, nice one is also ""Old love"" but wwe'vre heard it before somehow it feels. Good album but could also have been better, but the good moments of it are worth the money."
3,It's not bad,"I just got the album, and from what I've heard so far. It's not half bad at all. I don't care for track number 5. NO Doubt. But other than that. I like it. I still don't see the point in adding Scola into the group, but hey, I have no say so in that."
4,HIP HOP 101,"I been listenin to Dru Hill for a LONG time. So I was hyped up when this joint came out. The only thing I can find wrong with it is the song ""If I Could"", but all the other joints are HOTT. For real yo, COP THIS I hope there will be more to come from Dru Hill"
5,Dru Hill is back!!!!,Dru World Order is on point and I think Dru Hill make a very good comeback. I like the way that they keep that r&b feel but has ur head bobbin' at the same time. This album will be sure to keep ur attention the whole way through. :)
1,There's No Dru in Hill,"As a fan (now former fan) of Dru Hill, this album comes as a major disappoint to me. This album was not only predictable R&B garbage, but these guys show no soul or growth in their songs. This album also sounds like a rush job and the new member offers nothing new or exciting. Long time ago, someone told me that Dru Hill was nothing more than a copy cat of Jodeci. After listening to this album, I must agree."
2,it is bad,I did not like the cd at all it doesnt compare to any of the other dru hill albums. I should be is the best song on the whole album . They could have done much better.
2,Huh,"Okay let me get this right. First they broke-up then they got back together and added another member. I guess splitting money between four members is not enough, let's add another member. I watched dru hill on 106 and park and the new dude was acting like he was already famous before he got with dru hill(right). I was one of dru hill's biggest fan back in 96-99, but they fell off. No body wants to hear a bunch of dudes sing and take their shirts off anymore. This is 03 and it's time for a change. Dru hill is weak. Sisqo should just came out of the closet and keep it real. I seen the way he was looking at the other members as if he wanted to sing in their laps. Dru hill is finished, give it up"
5,dru hill takin over,this cd is taking over! dru hill's unique style and smooth vocal are still taking the world by storm. this is one of those cd that you never skip a track on. Check it out you won't be disappointed.
2,"Would be perfect indeed, if your car never goes anywhere","While the material and molding seems to be top quality, the design makes it utterly impractical for holding a cell phone in a moving vehicle.2 of the 3 compartments are large enough to hold most any cell phone in a vertical position, but the phone will not fit if you try to lay it on its side. This turns out to be a major problem, as the depth of each compartment is only 1.5 inches. Do a sudden stop or evasive maneuver and your phone will go toppling over the edge and end up who knows where.Given that the typical smartphone is around 4.5 inches tall, this product is useless!!"
2,Very Dissapointing,You get what you pay for.I was excited to find these almonds at what I considered a low price that I attributed to the larger 4lb. bulk size. The flavor was not at all what I have found in slightly more expensive nuts. I will not go cheap again. They almost tasted pre-roasted. Must not have been very fresh. Will not order again!!
4,Almonds.,What can I say about them. They are good and they are great chopped up in my cereal and on ice cream.
2,"Not the best, or second best I have had.","I love raw almonds and I liked the price of these almonds.However, the bag I received did not taste good at all, and the texture was off, a bit mealy. There was no fresh almond nut flavor, either raw or roasted in the oven. The almonds had an aged quality to them, not spoiled, but not fresh, either.More than 85% of the bag is left, and I won't be eating them or using them as an ingredient."
3,Pretty good value,"Unfortunately, these almonds arrived a bit on the stale side. Was glad they came from here in the US, though!"
3,for the price it was good....,Kind of had a wierd taste. I really don't no if I would order again but it was not HORRIBLE.
5,"RAW ""natural"" almonds - no roasting, added fat, or salt!","These almonds are ""packaged by Spicy World, sold by Simply Beautiful, fulfilled by Amazon, shipped by Deeva Fullfillment Services, Inc"" - so its hard to know WHO takes the credit for the quality. They dont state the origin, but these almonds are definately smaller and less tasty than the ""California almonds"" I purchased previously - but I KNEW they were probably foreign because they are packed by Spicy World, and because the price was less than 6 dollars a pound, including postage. So there u go. I got what I paid for - cheap almonds of uncertain origin."
3,Nothing special,"These almonds came in a large plastic bag with a twist tie at the top. They were not sealed in any way, which isn't necessarily bad just seemed a little odd to me. Some reviewers complained about the taste, i didn't have an issue with that. They cost about the same as the Emerald brand from Walmart and I don't have to wait for delivery. I was expecting them to either have a better taste than what I could get from a big box store or be cheaper. If you have a Costco or BJ's membership you can get them for even cheaper than this so the product itself is fine, no complaints, there are just cheaper and easier options available out there. Nothing special here."
2,cheap packaging,"I purchase almonds each month and every time I open a fresh pack, the ziploc seal is never closed and sometimes when you open the package, the zip is ripped so that it never closes again. Love the almonds, but the packaging is cheap and does not ensure Almonds stay fresh."
4,Best bang for the buck,"We bring almonds with us every day to work to supplement our lunches. They keep us away from being hungry and are a tasty snack. These aren't the highest quality almonds I have ever had, that prize goes to my father-in-law's nut guy, who has disappeared, but are very good. Also, I think this product is the best bang for the buck, quality/quantity/price on Amazon."
1,Not great...,I eat a lot of almonds. These taste stale and chalky. I will probably just make almond milk out of them to use them up. Bleh. I will not be buying again.
1,Not fresh,I buy and eat a lot of almomds. I make almond milk and almond butter. I usually buy almonds from the produce section in Walmart. Walmart almonds are always fresh. Many times Walmart doesn't have them in the produce section because they sell out. These almonds are soft and do not taste fresh. The almond butter doesn't have a good flavor when I use these.I'll stick with Walmart and will not be ordering these again.
2,not as good as others...,"Have ordered unsalted almonds by the pound one time previously, and these were not flavorful like the others. The ones ordered previusly were sweeter, had more nutty flavor, and were slightly more chewy (not as dry). I would think that these are tasteless/flavorless because they have been sitting on a shelf for a long time (like tea leaves loose their flavor over time), but not sure because I don't have any fresh ones with which to compare them."
5,ALMONDS GREAT BUY,Great buy for the money. Almonds are large and whole. I am planning to order more almonds plus other nuts from this company.
4,Alot of great features for planning your fitness program,"Vivonics Fitness Planner has alot of features that are really a pleasure to discover. One thing that I think is outstanding is the way it shows anything that you have eaten too much of in red. That's great...but even better, when you click on it, you are shown which of the foods contain it and how much from most to least. Since I teach dance, I do notice that it is hard to find fitness information that includes dance as an exercise. Dancers are very fitness conscious and it should be included in more books and programs. I do doubt that there is a better Fitness planning program than this one. It is very easy to locate foods and nutrients, etc. I am still learning to use it...but it isn't difficult at all. I really do recommend it."
2,"Vivonic, better cross your fingers","It is a very interesting piece of software...BUT the company does not support the product in any way...no tech support, noproblem resolution, no product updates, need I go on??????"
1,Vivonic Fitness Planner,"This is a horribly laid out program. After one goes through and enters values of weight, routine, physical measurements, etc., it does not compute a regiment for you. I'm waiting for the new Fred ""Dr. Squat"" Hatfield program to come out later this year. The company that carried his previous program, ""BodyCraft"" discontinued the contract a few years ago. Stay away from this Vivonic garbage!"
3,Be very careful,I have been using this item since Christmas. It's nice at first but there appear to be flaws in the software. All my entries for February just disappeared and it's a CHORE to re-enter them. I've tried calling their customer support number 7 times and all it does is ring. This product is nice on paper and works for a while but DON'T waste your money. With no website and no customer support when things go wrong....somebody is making money with garbage.
1,"Great deal, not very effective","This is a wonderful price, but the product is not very effective. Cod Liver Oil is a great source of Vitamins A and D which promote strong, healthy teeth. With other brands my teeth felt hard and strong, this brand was not effective, and I felt my teeth actually becoming softer and weaker.I use Green Pasture's fermented Cod Liver Oil now and highly recommend it over cheaper varieties."
5,BIG sound from a small package!,"These impressive Wharfedale Diamond Anniversary bookshelf-size speakers pack sound quality and clarity of speakers costing [$$$} dollars or more (believe me). Its outstanding bass response eliminates the need of a subwoofer. Ideal for applications where limited space is provided. I am very impressed with the soundstage that it set in my living room. These are clearly ONE OF THE BEST bookshelf speakers at ANY price. For complete audio satisfaction BUY THESE SPEAKERS. I would have to agree on most of these reviews. The only problem is the location of the grill mounting things, which are located just below the woofer surround and an inch away from the dome, but they sound better with the grill off anyways so it's not critical.For the sound that comes out of these things, its price is a bargain. GET THESE SPEAKERS!!"
3,"Beautiful cabinets, ok sound",I find the sound from these very small speakers ok -- impressive bass for size but mid-range seems a little boomy and higher frequencies seem a little muted. Rosewood cabinets are beautiful. Good choice for non-critical listening in small room.
4,Wonderful Wharfedale Speakers,"These speakers just sing. Their sound is open, full, and amazingly 3 dimensional. Push them and they don't bark-they just get a bit congested. Lovely rosewood veneer. This was an excellent price too. I am very happy with them."
4,OK for a small speaker,"I have a pair of these in my library. For a small speaker, they're pretty good, BUT I like chamber music and in particular string quartets. I find the close-miked string reproduction generally boxy, and have to play them at background levels, otherwise I find the sound annoying. Piano reproduces well, as do vocals. I found they were very susceptible to sympathetic vibration when I placed them on bookshelves or small tables, and ended up buying a pair of Sanus speaker stands (see my review), which has improved the sound considerably."
3,For those about to rock...look somewhere else!,"These speakers have the best top-end I have ever heard in a bookshelf speaker. I have actually heard details in my CD's that I had never heard before. However, the mid-range is flat and the Wharfdales have no bass to speak of.If you listen to classical or acoustic type music, these are wonderful (and pretty) speakers, at a great price. If you want to rawk out, or get your groove on, look somewhere else.I think these speakers would be best used as part of a home theater setup. The Diamond 7's really shine with a good center and a sub to take up their slack."
5,The complete Tales of Washington Irving,"As a child, I was familiar with the stories of Rip Van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, but did not know of Irving's other works. I really enjoyed these short stories and to have them all in one book was an added bonus. I like Irving's writing style and the twists and turns of his stories. Although some modern readers might find some of his works a little difficult to read. That aside, I feel most modern readers are at a loss if they don't give this eighteen century writer a try. I would recommend this book of classic tales to anyone. That's why I gave it a five star rating."
4,"A review on ""Puppy School"" by Jenny Dale","If you have read Teachers pet then you would know what the disobedient Dalmatian Dotty is like! well, in Puppy School Dotty manages to get pregnant and her owner, Mr Hamley, Has more trouble than he expects wuth the new bundle of spotty Pups!"
1,Box of Junk,For the price I believed this model would have been a snap together finished product like my Hogan models. Tjis purchase was a bust. Total throw away!
4,good for beginner,I'm new to cake decorating and I love this book it gives good pictures and step by step instructions for all their cakes I've done 3 of them and the one on the front is my most requested.... I recomend it to anyone who has an interest in cake decorating
5,Must Have,"This is an absolutly wonderful book. It's very informative and is good for people who are just starting out because it goes into a lot of detail about how to do some basic designs. I thought the cakes in the book were also very nice, there were very few that I did not like. There are step by step instructions on how to do all the cakes pictured in the book."
3,"Ok, but nothing super exciting","This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However, the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for ""cake decorating ideas"" when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly, if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it."
4,Nice book to have.,This is anther nice basic book from Wilton. It doesn't have as many ideas as I would've liked but it is a really good reference book. Goes through a lot of techniques and explains them with nice colored pictures. It is worth having.
4,Great buy!!,Better than I was hoping for. Nice red color and very deep for lots of layers . Thanks for a great price amazon.
5,Just what we needed...,"My 8th grade son had to do a report about Al Capone for her History class and needed to find several pieces of information. He was having a hard time finding any books at the library (I think maybe he just didn't want to read, only get information from the web). It was a huge project in our school, due on ""American History Day"" when the children all dressed up as their characters.And I loved being able to download this on my Kindle! Amazon...you saved the day!"
2,Not Good Tutorial,"I thought this book was going to be execellent cuase it is written by many famous porgrammer. But the book teaches you old tricks that that alot of Flasher know, and it done in Flash 4 we have Flash 5!"
2,Inadequate and badly designed,"The more critical reviews here are on target. This book is a great example of vile design -- neither visually nor functionally strong. It is easily 30% more bulky than it needs to be (and probably twice as costly). The reason? The authors and designers want you to think you're getting something you aren't.What everybody wants with Flash 5 is a thorough and methodical account of Actionscripting. This book does provide some great examples by outstanding Flash people. But ultimately, it's like the huge box that arrives. You pry it open and inside it's mostly straw. Yes, there are some gems in there, but given the number of web sites that explain many of the same things."
4,Great Read,"I really loved the book and the CD, well worth the money. I don't understand the Eric Jordan hype though"
3,"Well, I thought...","I thought it would be a great conversation piece under my glass coffee table. It turned out to be this rather unusual bridge between two worlds. Never having seen one of these before, colors intensely blinding. I ended up reading ones life through this very book. Not much back in my day, but believe me, it is a keeper."
2,Not the right book for anyone,"This is not for the beginners, and as an advanced actionscripter myself, I gained nothing. Maybe the intermediate will learn a few things or two about duplicating movies and if-else statements, but not much more. You will know how to recreate some tired and highly copied visual effects though, something you could of grabbed from the many flash resources online, and for free. But of course, knowing and understanding is two very different things. Actionscripting is a powerful language; if you don't understand at the basic level what certain commands do, you are going to have to be happy grabbing other people's scripts and editing them to your liking, which won't take you far at all. Plus flash is a heck of a lot more than just eye candy. So the basic point is, don't think of this book as a tutorial."
3,I've seen better,"Don't get me wrong this is a good book showcasing a few designers with some ""good"" flash sites. But saying these are the masters of Flash is a little misleading. Being in the business of creating websites I've seen a lot of Flash sites and have created a few of my own. I've seen a lot of good designs and I would definitely count a few of the individuals in this book Masters. But leaving out the designers means you don't have all the masters, or the best Masters of Flash. Better to call it ""Very good Flash Designers"". Otherwise for people with some knowledge of Flash and for people who want some design ideas, this is a good book."
2,"I agree, its a disappointment","I've read a lot of Flash books lately, and saw some buzz on this one and was really disappointed. I was pretty excited about getting this book and then was let down after reading it. It's like the authors or publishers - I am not sure which - saw the book on Flash Web Design by Curtis Hillman and said, ""Hey, let's copy this one."" I'd recommend steering clear of this one. There are better books on the market."
4,Near Perfect,"The philosophy in this book is meandering and tangential at best. I am not interested in hearing about designer's favorite colors, their blood type, their dreams - - - I am interested in seeing a dissection of their work from a functional and technological point of view.Rather than a bio on the author, I'd prefer a bio of the POINT of the work.Mastery of Flash, to me, is reinventing the rotating 3D junk and making it useful. That needs to be addressed foremost in any flash book.These people *DID* cut through the fat. . . but rather than hearing them wax philosophic, I'd prefer to hear the practicalities of the applications."
1,Terrible customer service - damaged product,"I received this product broken and complained about it. I got no responses from them at all. When I called they said they would send me a UPS shipping label to return it which never happened.I got it from BabyAge instead who were wonderful to deal with in comparison. I had to ask Amazon to intervene, which they did, to refund my money."
1,BEWARE OF SUFFOCATION!,Just went to the ER today after I found my 4 month old with his face wedged in the corner.When I picked him up he was blue.(He is fine now but I am getting rid of the co-sleeper!)This co-sleeper is not safe once they can wiggle around at all. My 4 month old cannot roll over yet.In the past couple of days he began kicking his legs enough to move himself around.I believe his ability to move himself around coupled with the co-sleeper's corner that is NOT mesh contributedto this horrible event. He could have died!
1,Please ....,"I bought this movie last week and I wannted to cry,because I wast my money. It was to much yelling and screaming you couldnt hear none of the bad actors. The story line was good,but the camara man was terrible you would have thought a 5 year old was holding it. The zombies looked like regular people. Dont wast your money folks."
3,Server+ Review,"The Server+ Training Kit is structured and organized very well, and delivers up-to-date information about various server-related subjects. Its only downfall might be that the question formats do not so much resemble the actual test, as well as the lack of electronic test material. The upside to this book is that it delivers the nuts and bolts basics of what you need to know with this technology in order to achieve test success. This book, coupled with an electronic test prep such as the Server+ Test Pro from Certification Corner will ensure the learner that they need only take this exam once in order to achieve Server+ certification success."
3,"smells nice, but doesn't last","I read the reviews and I decided to buy this cologne for my dog, but the smell doesn't last, and it;s not that strong. I have purchased another colognes, like ck-8, wich I love because of the smell and it last at least 24 hours.This one is fine for two hours.."
4,"Beautiful bag, too small",I had to return this bag; my 17in Dell laptop would not fit in it. I NEED A SMALLER LAPTOP!
4,Ladies Leather Laptop Briefcase,"Great price for a beautiful Italian leather laptop case. Came quickly, was in perfect condition."
1,Piece of junk,"As mentioned by other reviewers, it has problems playing DVD's. It skips. The sound fades in and out. I bought this for my parents. They were so excited until I hooked it up for them and spent hours on xmas day trying to get it to work. For the price, I wasn't expecting top of the line sound or picture, but at the least I expected it to work. I should be refunded not only for the cost of this piece of crap but the time I spent on xmas day trying to get it to work properly."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this at Target last November and have sent it off to Ventura twice for repair. The cost to ship it twice was over $80.00 with promise of reimbursement the last time I shipped. The problem with the unit is that it pauses for long periods of time while playing a DVD. It has never been fixed and recently they sent it back to me without my remote and they lost my Miracle DVD that I sent with it. I have the documentation acknowledging that they would watch for the DVD and send it back, but nope they didn't and also I now don't have a remote. PLUS it still doesn't work."
4,As advertised,Product came on time as advertised. Although you have to look really close to see Belkin stamped on the ends.
2,This just HAD to be a doctoral thesis...,"...written by one who was at his wit's end to find an original topic. As a medievalist with a special interest both in Chaucer and the mystics of the era, it was obvious to me that the author was bending the words of the latter to fit Chaucer's characters. Neither aspect, fascinating though both are, survived the operation."
1,BE WARNED,"I am an Orson Welles fanatic. I love Chimes At Midnight and Othello and Macbeth and Ambersons and Kane and etc etc etc. I bought this not expecting much other than perhaps some beautifully filmed scenes. I was not prepared for it to be so unremittingly awful though. The film is in less than bad shape. The shots are not strong in the slightest and the whole thing is put together terribly. They try to dub it and nothing works. In addition, the actor hired as narrator is doing an absurd imitation of Welles himself. The editing is also semi professional. The whole thing is a shambles. I say avoid it at all costs. Even if you adore Welles and think you need this to complete your knowledge of him and his work, you DON'T. You will be sorely disappointed. It is just awful."
1,Terrible,"This may be the worst movie I've every seen. From a Spanish point of view, it was sort of with the book for about half the movie, but then went off the deep end. The film was also poorly dubbed and just poorly done. It sounded like they were in a tunnel. I doubt that Orson Welles would want his name on this."
1,boring - no content,"Only a few scenes in this dvd relate to book. Another, who was watching with me, left early because she couldn't stand the lack of content any longer. Too much of Orson Welles' and his cigar - nothing to do with Don Quixote. Of no value to keep for future viewing so will dispose of it promptly."
1,Shipping 6.95,"They sent me this charm on a post card at teh cost of .80 and charged 6.895, when their add stated .90...rip off chrm is just ok"
4,"Good range, could be louder","This remote doorbell chime does the job. I have the chime in my detached garage about 50 ft from the transmitter. The signal passes through a drywall, a closed window, and an open garage door. Less than 5 stars because although the chime has a loudness adjustment, even the loudest setting is a little quiet for me to hear above the noise I sometimes make in the garage. One other shortcoming is that the transmitter was too large to fit inside the existing doorbell housing. In my case, the transmitter could be placed above the housing where it cannot be seen."
4,Extend a chime,"We have a small family room in the back, rear, corner of our house and could not hear the doorbell ring. I was going to add another doorbell but after trying to trace out the existing wiring in the attic and not being able to find the doorbell transformer,(its an old house), I decided to try the Extend-A-Chime.I am amazed at how easy it was to install. I connected the three wires to my existing chime box and placed the sending unit on top of the chime box with the double sided tape that came with the extend a chime unit. I then placed the receiving unit in a spare electric outlet in the family room. The receiver works off of AC power, no need for any batteries. The transmitter gets it's power from the doorbell.The transmitter is about 50 feet from the receiver and it works fine.The only suggestion that I would have is a design suggestion. It would be much better if the type of door bell chime settings be placed on the receiver instead of the transmitter unit."
1,"Junk, Waste of money!",Initially worked for me. After a couple of months I discovered it had quit working. This item is totally unreliable. Today it will work only if it is within 25 ft of the transmitter. This thing is obviously junk and useless to me. This item is not recommended!! I hope I can find one that will really work.
1,Bad choice,"It is inexpensive, but cheap. Installed just before Christmas, it now no longer works. It was a breeze to install, and sounded great at first, but now, nothing."
4,Great for those areas you need it,I ordered this one to replace another unit that I had for years. This one has the advantage of selecting a couple different chimes. Works pretty good.
4,works great,"It was easy to setup, works great with my existing door bell and switch. 4 stars because the maximum volume could have been louder than it is."
3,"It works, but it's not pretty and options are limited","It does what I wanted, it gives me a second doorbell downstairs. That being said, even at max volume, it is not very loud, not nearly as loud as I would have liked. Secondly, the options to change the sound tones are pretty antiquated, you have to pull jumper pins and move them around for various ring tones, it seems a little antiquated in this day and age. Finally, the sender unit attaches to the wired doorbell in the house. The sender unit is not overly large, but I could not find enough space to fit it into the existing doorbell plastic housing, which appears to be a very standard housing. Thus, the sender unit just sits atop the existing doorbell looking like an oddity.It's not a bad design. If it was louder and the sender unit smaller, it would have fit the bill perfectly, however for the price, I guess I can't complain too much."
4,Works exactly as described....,"I neede to extend my doorbell to where I work on my computer. This product worked exactly as described...installed easy, worked first time. I paid a little bit more for one with more choices than a simple dink dong that had a little better range. The additional choices are not many, but it is fine. Like the product - met all expectations."
5,Works good,I bought this extender for my shop which is downstairs. It works every time. I do wish it was a bit louder but it's a reasonably priced remedy for my situation.
3,Not for chimes with audible functions,This product did not work with my intercom chime. It apparently works with everything except chimes with an audible feature. I had to return it.
4,Works GREAT,This Plug-In Extend-A-Chime is extremely easy to connect and works great. The only draw back that I'll attribute to it is that the volume could be higher. Tested various tones and pretty much they're all the same volume.
4,Works Well But...,"I installed this in my home about a year ago.I also purchased a second ""plugin add chimreceiver""so that I can have chime speakers in the basement and on the second floor.It works well and the chimes are nice and loud.However I have noticed that placement of the receivers requires some experimentation.Some outlets in my home appear to not always receive a good signal.Proximity to large electronics appear to interfere with the signal.I had one working fine in a particular outlet for several weeks until i moved a guitar amplifier to that part of the room then the chime stopped working. I moved it to another outlet and it worked again.So if the product does not appear to work for you simply try another outlet."
3,"Good range, but not loud enough","Bought this for my father, who is hard of hearing. Volume adjustment need to allow louder settings. Otherwise, easy to install and works well."
5,VERY GOOD,"This product is of very good quality, and has an excellent aroma is really good ... .. my girlfriend loved it, sure as many women."
4,"A ""must-read"" for old-school Dungeons and Dragons fans","I picked this book up after reading that it supposedly inspired some of the original 'Dungeons and Dragons' crew (like Gary Gygax) and influenced some of the rules, classes, and monsters. Overall, I can see exactly what they mean! The story is fun and glides along at a fast clip and is filled with likeable characters and interesting magic and creatures. Little things like references to kobolds and dwarves as well as a straight-out-of D&D; troll that regenerates really make this fun. It ends on a bit of a cliffhanger note, but that's OK... it leaves the whole 'anything can happen' path open.As a fantasy book goes, it sets up some interesting realms and opens up a whole bunch of ideas. It doesn't get into much depth of character or into much of an original storyline, but it's fun, easy to read, and really part of the birth of ""Dungeons and Dragons"". This is a must read for old-school D&D; gamers and a pretty fun read for other fantasy fans."
2,Supression of exculpatory evidence.,"Her premise is faulty; her science fair, and her conclusions border on the criminal! The implied conclusion of this book is serial monogamy is the ""natural mating"" schema. ""Serial monogamy"" is an oxymoron. I was left with the opinion the study was funded by divorce attorneys.Dr. Fisher states ""...THE word ""lubh"" in Sanskrit meaning 'to desire' is where our word for love comes from."" I one checks the Cologne sanskrit Digital Lexicon and searches for love, there are 531 entries including ""lubh"" which also means 'to attach'. Love is far more complex than simple desire!Her fMRI studies used only hormonal college students who were ""madly in love"". However, once passing over her agenda, there is some acceptable science in the book."
2,narrow,"I read some of this book on loan...and also listened to the author's interview concerning this book. Most of what I've read and heard is a bunch of fluff that might appeal to some mass market along the lines of Oprah psychology. Why people spend so much time and ""research"" on trying to define the source of a love gene is beyond me. What is the end goal? It's as if learning the ""root"" cause of love will somehow provide great insight into what we already know and experience about love: science cannot explain the human heart and its complexities. Like a character in a Woody Allen movie, most people cannot fathom their own hearts and the depths and complexities involving the mystery we call love.Nonetheless, I don't blame any researcher for trying to earn a living delving into the ""un-delvable!"""
2,Disappointing,"I liked Helen Fisher's previous book Anatomy of Love but this one is a disappointment. The new science is skimpy. She reports findings from a single unpublished fmri study and a questionnaire. So, after reading sappho or ovid, one gets sentences such as ""65% of men agreed with the statement that being in love made them feel lighter than air"" She's clearly not a brain scientist. Her discussions of the neurotransmitters which she annoyingly calls ""liquors"" and brain anatomy is simplified and rudimentary.Last, its extremely quote heavy, so much so that she could easily make a separate book out of all the quotes. Her own writing in contrast is uninspired, e.g. ""Please meet the prairie vole."" ""Now nature's timeless dance would begin."""
4,interesting and wide ranging,"This book covers a number of recent discoveries in the neurochemistry of romantic love, many from the author's own lab. These are often told in a narrative style, describing the participants (names changed). In my opinion somewhat more space could have been given to other investigators' work.The writing is generally fluent and thought-provoking in the American style. I objected to Dr. Fisher's recurrent 'just-so' explanations for various aspects of romantic love: she maintains that every aspect of love has had a purpose in our recent evolutionary past. However I (and many evolutionary theorists of the mind) think that linkage to a selected trait is a more likely explanation - that some aspects of the mind were selected for immediate survival value, but these brought along other traits that have developed into the modern mind."
2,Too wordy,"The whole of the book can probably fit on 20 pages if it wasn't for references to irrelevant personalities that lived centuries ago and said obvious things. Why do books of this kind feel compelled to quote Shakespear in the original with all those arcane words? It just makes it hard to read. Once you do take the time to decipher them, the ideas are so obvious that it's really not necessary to mention them. For example (and I'm approximating because I don't have the book around), a chapter would be titled ""Passion"" and then the author just has to mention some guy in the 12th century who said something like ""Passion consumes you day and night"". Everybody knows how passion feels, let's move on.But to be fair, I did find the info on chemical processes involved in love very interesting."
3,Too much loose talk and not enough brain chemistry,"Fisher's book is based mainly on a couple of functional MRI studies of people in love, happily or unhappily. These studies provide very interesting information on the nature of love, and it would have been interesting with more detail on that.Instead, the author gives us a lot of loose talk, with arguments of the type ""what would be a helpful strategy for our ancestors on the grasslands of Africa"". Furthermore, the writing is very repetitive. Some of the wilder claims of do not have references to research, but other books by Fisher. I am aware that this is a popular book, but that doesn't mean that one shouldn't use proper sources for information and provide the references.I suspect a good editor could have made a big difference here. The book could have been focused on the real and interesting information it does contain, and the loose talk could have been cut away. This would leave about 1/3 of the book."
3,"3 Chemicals, Mild But Imprecise.","This is a somewhat intruiging empirical study of the three chemicals that provide the evolutionary basis for love. Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Serotonin. The chapters on the differences between the sexes views and needs pertaining to intimacy sometimes hit the mark. Her observations were written in an engaging style devoid of technical jargon. However, the authors quoting of popular literary figures like Yeats and Dickens who wrote about Romantic love took away from her data since they were writing from a different and non-scientific perspective. Still, it is a worthy read."
5,Dont know,Dude this was like the best toy ever. Im even 34 and all the little action people this was my favorite of all.It kicks butt. I'm like the person that sits around watching tv and playing video games. This toy like tops all of the other things I do. Now the comic book was the best thing I have ever read.I like read it like every day. And that Foot thing I did not even knom what it was And it was so cooooooooool! Dudes and dudets you need to buy it. UNCLE SAM WHATS YOU TO BUY THE MARVEL LEGENDS FIGURE:UNMASKED ASTONISHING X-MEN WOLVERINE TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Little sex, little gore, in this ""erotic horror""","Edo van Belkom has a reputation for writing ""erotic horror."" The premise sounded good, so I took a chance ...Man, what a boring book! Not much sex, not much horror. And when it's there, the sex is non-erotic, the horror is non-scary. Instead, there's lots of dull characters talking and talking and talking ... Reads as though Van Belkon was just ""going through the motions.""""Teeth"" is said to have been a short story. Seems as though Van Belkon couldn't figure out how to expand his premise, as the book is mostly padding.If you want gut-wrenching erotic horror, try the first ""Hot Blood"" anthology. Some good stories in that."
2,Too many stems to use this item without placing it in cheesecloth or similar.,"I have only used epazote one previous time and only the leaves of the living plant. In this dried product there ara a lot of tough stems, too many in fact to just throw some in with the cooking beans. Need to wrap the epazote in cheese cloth or similar to contain the stems. I was surprised because Melissa's usually has a superior product. Perhaps the stems are included because this can also be used as a tea."
3,A different sound...,"While Mr. Barrett's voice is as gorgeous as ever, this CD is not a collection of musical theatre classics pulled from the original scores, as performed in the actual shows. Here are more jazzed up, contemporary versions, which sound good for what they are, but will leave customers who expect a more classic interpretation of the famous works a little disappointed."
4,Great Comforter,"This comforter is pretty thin, but it keeps you really warm. The blanket stays evened out so it's great. Really easy, and convenient to store away. Not recommended for warm weathers."
2,Pasted-on heads,What is the deal with the pasted on heads? Could they not find enough photos of stars in fun outfits & had to paste their heads onto other bodies? Or did they blow up the size of the heads on purpose? Weird.
4,Best of vs. Complete,"It seems that most people after viewing this are purchasing 'The Complete Father Brown' rather than this, and I would too. I've read Father Brown stories and they are all great! You cannot get enough of them, and I recommend getting 'The Complete', rather than 'The Best of'."
5,I miss tommy and rumble,"I have just moved away from the hampton roads area due to college but Tommy and Rumble are the best radio djs ever forget howard stern, don and mike, even the grease man and eliot in the morning [are bad] tommy and rumble are the best i own all their cds and i'm proud to be a fan"
4,Very satisfied with this product,"If your child is into Pixar Cars yet they are a bit too young for the more advanced racetracks, then this product will be perfect for them. The track simply folds in half for storage. It is extremely easy to use and my son loves to watch the cars zip around the track. If your little one is around 3-4 yrs old, I believe they will be very happy with this race track."
4,speed for my 3yr old,"A perfect toy! recommended by another friend, it is durable and offers enough action to keep my 3 yr old entertained for a while. It gives him a learning opportunity to test which cars will fit and work (not all ""CARS"" models work) and when more than 2 race, he has to ""time"" them on the ramp or they'll immediately crash- which is fun too! I would recommend this for anyone whose child likes cars, loud sounds, and speed, but is too young for the big kid toys."
4,My little guy loved it!,"I brought it for my 3 year old grandson and we had such a blast playing with it that his Dad went out and brought the larger one for his room. It's great as a ""Bring-A-long Toy"". Can get a little noisy so be ready for that! Otherwise if your kid loves ""Pixar Cars"" they will love it!Make sure you get the ""supercharged"" ones they stay on the track better."
3,The best of a slim field.,"Purchased this for my son who is a Cars Movie fanatic. He's 1 month away from 4 years old. Pretty simple toy. He's able to set it up without difficulty. The best thing about it is that it works with the original die cast Cars Movie race cars.I say best of a slim field because I couldn't believe how few race tracks there were for the Cars Movies? You would think it would be a given: Cars Movie, Cars Racetrack. The few that exist, don't work with the die cast cars, rendering the genuine issue useless.Anyhow, inexpensive, decent bang for the buck, and as stated, you can use the race cars from the die cast collection.Also, some people said the speed pedal doesn't do anything. It doesn't do alot, but it speeds the wheels up ever so slightly. (bring back the thundershift 500!)"
2,Dead motor,My 3 1/2 year old son loves the track however after less than 2 weeks of play the motor has lots it's zip and is now unable to propel the cars all the way around the track. When it's working he can spend hours at a time playing with the track but unfortunately it's not holding up and will most likely be returned.
3,Mommy of two boys - 4 & 6,"I was a little disappointed by it, but my two boys (4 & 6) enjoy it - especially the 4 year old. The car is propelled by motorized wheels that protrude slightly and whiz the car around the track. We used it with the Lightening McQueen that came with it. It seems like it would be more fun if we bought and added additional cars to ""race"" McQueen around the track."
5,Great gift,I gave this gift to my nephew for his 3rd birthday. I'm told he loves it and plays with it every day. It's easy to use and designed very well. He got a lot of cars for his birthday but this track is something he can entertain him self with all by himself.
2,VERY BORING TOY,"AFTER I READ ALL THE REVIEWS I THOUGHT MY 3YR OLD SON WOULD GO CRAZY WITH THIS TOY SPECIALLY THAT HE LOVES ""CARS"". THE CAR JUST GOES AROUND AND AROUND AND THE MOTOR MAKES A VERY LOUD NOISE..THE REALLY HAS NOT PAID ANY MIND TO IT..MY 7YR OLD DAUGHTER TURNS IT ON AND IN LESS THAN 3 MIN THEY LOOSE INTEREST. I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS! ANOTHER THING, THE PEDAL SUPPOSED TO INCREASE , DECREASE SPEED..YOU CANNOT NOTICE THE CHANGE AT ALL!"
2,If your kids love cars... you probably already own one!,"I purchased this toy before the movie went to DVD. I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old. They enjoyed the toy a lot when we 1st got it. Only some of the ""cars"" toys worked. The larger ones got stuck on the corners but some of the larger ""hot Wheels"" types worked. As time ticked away they have used it less and less. They do still however pull it out every once in a while and play with it.Not very educational though. :)"
4,amazing references terrible index,The huge number of references in this text is mind boggling but the index is HORRIBLE!! The worst index I have ever seen in a textbook.
1,Returned Item says it all,"The belt sander was returned immediately due to it's condition. It was supposed to be factory reconditioned ""Like new"". It was covered in heavy sawdust and the collector bag had a large hole in it. The collector tube was so out of shape it would not attach to the sander. Stick to the new products for Porter Cable. If the cost for new is too high, purchase a Makita."
1,Don't buy this,For a silicone spatula it is not heat-resistant. The first time I used it the edges cracked. Plus it is not flexible so you can only use it at certain angles. Waste of money...I sold it in my garage sale!I recommend Le Creuset instead.
4,Where's the second edition?,"I could say that this is the best field guide to the birds in Japan that I have ever found, but that might be misleading since it's the only such guide. Basically it's pretty adequate. Some of the art work is well short of the standards of some other guides I'm familiar with, such as the National G's N. American guide. But if you're going to be doing some birding in Japan, and you don't read Japanese, you'll appreciate this book. There is a more recent Japanese version which lists several additional species, but the only English version is from 1982. I'd like to see a new English version, with some improved plates, though I suppose the market is pretty limited and I'm not holding my breath."
5,The best book I have found yet!,"This field guide is by far the best bird guide I have found for Japan yet (in English). Absolutely perfect size for easy use in the field, yet has all the birds in it.This book is actually in use, in Japan, in the packs of noted birders and field researchers alike.Hint: Buy it from Amazon USA site vice the Amazon Japan site if you can, and save $30-$50!"
5,My son loves the tank!,"Product was in excellent in the box shape, my son was thrilled1 A+ seller who sends product quickly and at a good price!"
5,fantastic and results!,"This Set of DVD's is really challenging and actually quite fun compared to a lot of other exercise DVD's I've bought in the past. It's extremely effective as well. If you can devote to doing the 57 minute workout 5 times a week, you will see results very quickly within the first couple of weeks. I definitely recommend."
2,Form Please?,"I heard about physique 57th living in NYC. I have been taking classes at bar method so I may be a bit bias for their classes as I absolutely love them. Looking for a chepaer way to work out I ordered the physique 57 4 disc set. I see that the methods are similar, however Tanya Becker makes it a bit more cardio which is nice, but she doesn't discuss form or how important tucking is like the bar method emphasizes. It is too fast pace, leaving form out, which I have learned is essential to make convert your muscles in to long a lean shape. I am not fan of this set. I find Tanya annoying. If you can, take a bar method class if available. It uses the same ""Lotte Berk"" method and instruction is amazing, spot on and it nevers gets easy."
4,Good work out,"I enjoy the work out, wish the instructor new how to teach by mirroring. I am a group exercise instructor, when I face the class I mirror the students,my left side moves with their right side. It makes it easier for the class to follow. Tanya needs to learn how to do that for her videos. Other wise I love the workout."
2,Does not keep me engaged,"I have to say, the workout isn't just for me. It's a little on the boring side and I prefer something that keeps my interest."
4,Well worth reading,"Robert Menard looks at the process of negotiation from the buyer's side. The author's prose is simple and thoroughly readable. Well documented and informative, this book is certainly worth the investment."
4,Helps a child or adolescent understand medical hypnosis,This illustrated book explains the process of hypnosis to elementary school-aged children. It helps dispell the fear and misconceptions that a child or young adolescent might have about hypnosis. It discusses the ways that a child might use hypnosis to help himself with physical pain or emotional distress.The illustrations are by a 15-year-old who used hypnotherapy to deal with the effects of a chronic disease. The illustrator does a good job of showing hypnotic imagery from a child's perspective.
5,AN INFORMATIVE AND THRILLING READ,"""When Giants Ruled"" quickly involves the reader in the drama of print journalism's most robust era of cutthroat competition. Hy Turner demonstrates a strong talent for condensing the story of newspapers to its essence. He never overburdens you with details, though occasionally I found myself wishing for more. Meanwhile, the reader is often rewarded with new and colorful anecdotes to familiar events in our nation's history. Turner's superb writing skills keep the reader delightfully moving from one page to the next, while sometimes pausing to more fully enjoy the unfolding drama. It is a book that could only have been written by someone to whom journalism was obviously a first love."
4,solid performance,"Bibi Black is one of those soloists who seem to be forgotten in the wake of new female stars like Alison Balson and Tine Thing Helseth. Nevertheless, this recording demonstrates solid technique, musicianship, and style. Her interpretations of the Haydn and Hummel are relatively mainstream, but good, and her performance of Handel's Water Music Suite contains tasteful ornamentation, just the right amount of vibrato, and the required energy for such a piece."
3,Sensitive readers beware,"Devil's Kiss is not for the kids and it's not for easily disturbed readers either. The rape and killing scenes are graphic. However, this is one scary book. I read it when I was 16 and never forgot it."
5,"GREAT BOOK, FANTASTIC, READ THEM ALL",I READ ALL OF THE DEVILS SERIES AND REALLY ENJOY THEM ALL I ALSO READ THE NURSERY FOUND THIS VERY INTERESTING I WISH ICOULD FIND THEM ALL IN PRINT BECAUSE IT TELLS A LOT ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN TODAY WORLD THE DEVILS IS BUSY BUT GOD IS ALWAYS STANDING BY
1,"Boring, and horribly written.","I never give up on a book, but I came so close with this one. The story is a desperately poor man's version of 'The Stand.' It's chock full of terrible, unnatural-sounding dialogue and grammar errors, and it shifts to different characters/scenes with no indication. The same words (and scenes, practically) are used over and over, out of what seems to be unoriginality. Really poorly written. Plus, lots of conservative Christian commentary on life in general next to relatively explicit sex and orgy scenes. Either of those things are fine, and a better writer could have made it work, but it just comes off as strange and a bit off-putting here making you question the author's mindset. I understand it was Johnstone's first book, and he went on to write 200+ more. I can't imagine why anyone would give him the chance after this debut."
1,"I got to page 38, and then I could't take it anymore.","My question is this: Did William W. Johnstone ever take ANY form of writing instruction? Not only has the plot thus far bored me to tears, I suffer actual pain at having to read this poorly worded, meandering nonsense. I am honestly not sure how this ever got published...his editor must have been on crack that day. Please, if you haven't yet purchased this book...don't make the same mistake I did. I wonder if Revco will refund me? (PS, i wasn't going to give this ANY stars...but it wouldn't post without one)"
4,A good beach read,"Meridon is the third and last book in a 3-book series about the Lacey women who struggle to own/manage their family estate, called Wideacre, in a time when female children did not inherit any ownership rights of their family property. All three books in this series are enjoyable, and Phillippa Gregory adds period details that give you insight into life in England at that time. This book was my least favorite out of the three, partly because some of the language and settings were repeated from the first two books, and also because Meridon's life as a gypsy didn't seem quite as believable as the stories in the first two novels. Meridon was still an interesting conclusion to the series as I was interested to see if the women in the Lacey family ever gained control of their estate."
4,A grand conclusion,"Third book in this series and finally a ""Happy"" ending. Enjoyed it and would reccomend it to others."
5,Meridon,Pleased with my latest book purchase from Amazon. Good service and book arrived in excellent condition as stated it would.Also pleased with the low price. Mrs. J. Frederking
3,Meridon,"The book was an older version on the cover. I thought I was getting the newer cover one when I ordered. However, I do hope that the contents of the book are the same, since I read the preceding two books in the newer version."
2,A Disappointment from Gregory,"[ASIN:0743249291 Wideacre : A Novel; ASIN:0743249305 The Favored Child : A Novel; ASIN:0743249313 Meridon]Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors, yet one of my least favorite authors. She writes brilliantly when writing of major historical characters like King Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth, Mary, Queen of Scots, Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn, as well as the people involved in the War of the Roses. However, when she writes period fiction and/or romances without the historical framework of these real people, her writing descends to abyssmal tales of sorcery, incest and manipulation. True, some of these same themes appear in her better historical works -- but only as sub-plot subject material. However, these heavily-used themes, with little else by way of story line, make reading the Wideacre series a chore, rather than a pleasure. Thank you, Ms. Gregory, for your brilliant historical research and writing. But please, don't waste your talent on trash like this."
5,"Great book, great readeing and learning",All the books ao Ms Gregory are greta - learning by reading and having joy.
5,One of an excellent trilogy,"This is a great trilogy by an exciting author. The stories stand alone, but are better when read as a group."
2,Not a good Phillipa Gregory novel or trilogy,"I bought the whole trilogy that included Meridon and all it did was depress me. Just when you think someone couldn't be more evil or the book couldn't be more depressing, it would get you again. I was very disappointed with this trilogy because I very much enjoy Gregory's work with the Tudor era."
3,A little more description is necessary...,"I have not even had a cup of coffee from this yet and feel compelled to write a review so someone else doesn't make the same mistake. You MUST use coarse ground coffee in this device for it to work properly. The instructions beg you not to use fine ground (you know, 99.9% of the stuff you can buy at the store)as it will malfunction the plunger mechanism and then you won't be able to clean it properly. So guess what? I didn't have any coarse ground coffee just laying around so now I've got to figure out where to get some.This would have been great information to have prior to the purchase."
1,Not the original artists,"I didn't realize until I received my order that these are not sung by the original artists. There is small print on the back that says that it is newly recorded by the ""Hit Crew"". This CD was a big disappointment, make sure that you listen to the samples before your buy it."
5,Great product for the money.,"Great product for the money. Needed one socket to complete my set, because one got misplaced. It's great to be able to purchase only one socket to complete my set.Great quality that you've come to expect from Milwaukee Tool. Fast shipping as well.Very happy with this small purchase.RagenRat"
5,The Wicca Bible,This has absolutely everthing for the beginner. This is an enjoyable book with a font of information. Well worth the money!
4,Nice infomation...but the pictures?,"...Overall, this book is great and have a lot of information, very useful for beginners. But the image shown are not very attractive.. I recommend it! :)"
1,Overlong and fanciful tale,"Tha characters invented for this historically based tale are just too fanciful. To prove this point may I take readers to the end chapters where British Admiral Langston is introduced to the story. He is presented by the author as being all put out by the actions of his idiot captain who tried to destroy the American ship at the Azores. This is all too Bush/Blair touchy feely stuff and is intended to portray the British aristocracy as being so pro American that only stupid naval people, albeit acting under the British flag, when they loose to an honourable foe, have to be disowned. And by gum are they disowned in this ridiculous story !! It is all about Rule Britannia, in brotherly love with our brave American (though misguided) allies. GIVE ME A BREAK."
2,A Poor Offering From Black Lace,"This book was fairly boring and rates low on the arousal scale. There are far better ones out there and I would not advise anyone to pick this one up, (unless you get it for free :)"
2,I WHOULDENT SUGGEST THIS,"This Zam's legs dont bend & her left arm only goes up & down. She does not hold on to her guns too well. If your thinking about buying this to play with don't, because you may be disappointed. If your a collector then its a must have! If you want a good Zam to play with I would suggest the other Zam with the quick draw action. I hope my review was helpful to you!"
4,mmm . . . purple,"Like the other Attack of the Clones preview figures, Zam Wesell has nice detail and limited articulation. She has a pistol and a rifle, both of which are thin and made of soft plastic which makes them prone to bending. The red ""blaster bolt"" seems almost too heavy for the rifle to which it attaches (I left it on for a couple of days and the rifle started to droop). It also took quite a bit of finesse to get her rifle to stay in her hands. Her veil is hard plastic and is not removable from her face. She does have two extra points of articulation on her right arm (bicep and wrist) which allow her to hold up her pistol in menacing fashion. Nice detail on her clothes and a decent paint job. Grown-up collector types should be happy with this figure. I don't know how well it will hold up to the rigors of being played with by a child."
3,Great for collectors,"This action figure is perfect for displaying. The detail very good. The play value is limited however, because the arms and legs cannot bend. As said earlier, this one is ideal for display."
3,Probably his worst...,"Pac/Makaveli is undoubtably the best emcee. Albums such as Don Killuminati, All Eyez On Me, etc... show his true talent. This album doesn't. When I first heard that Pac had a new album I hurried up and downloaded it all, and I was very suprised that they'd want to represent Pac like this. Then after hearing Thugz Mansion (acoustic with Nas) on BET a couple times, I started to like that song, and pretty much that's the only song off of the album that at least I like...If you have 20 extra bucks and can't think of anything else to get, then get this... otherwise just download Thugz Mansion (acoustic) and go buy the Makaveli album."
4,2pac Better Dayz,I give 2pac Better Dayz cause it is just not as good as the ones as when he was alive and most people cant tell the different even though i am big 2pac u like Better Dayz go get some more 2pac cDs All Eyez on Me and more so get out there buy Better Dayz cause this is a a Cd u will miss out if u arent goin to get this Cd and the all the great songs in it Thugz Mansion and more
4,Good cd if he was livin it wuld be better,"i.ve rated this cd with 4 stars becouse his lirycs on this one are as good as normal,my favorite number they dont give a f*[**] about us,is one of my favorites on this number is the lyric as well as the music verry good and that is what i like.other numbers like mama's just a little girl are verry verry good and thugz mansion is great not to forget still ballin.and every lyric has a message in it and that's what i like from 2pac. rest in peace."
5,Better Dayz,this album is by far the most antisipated release since the start of the death row revolution and it sounds amazing almost asif it was recorded months ago it is new but still keeps the pac inside of things by far the best album ever put out by shaqur
4,Best Pac is alive Pac,But no disrespect I would have to say this is the best Pac album after he died one CD he is mad and the other he is in his all eyes on me faze(in love and Peaceful) Good CD
5,He's Back,I think u know that 2pac he's the king of hiphop i wanna just tell u that the king is back.... this is one of the best album he did.... u schold buy it... R.I.P 2pac shakur amaru makaveli the thug
5,Ghetto Rating,"I've seen some of the reviews and I don't know how anyone can rate Ghetto Star or Never Call You B**ch Again an 8/10 that's ridiculous, Ghetto Star is one of the best if not the best track on the album, Thug Love. The album is great."
3,toothpicks latest album is a slight dissapointment,"2pac's new album is okay, i felt dissapointed when they changed up the beats for his new album. This album is his weakest album out of all his albums because in his older albums, you can listen fully without skipping tracks. My favorite songs in this album are STREET FAME, GHETTO STAR, THIS LIFE I LEAD, and THEY DON'T GIVE A ...ABOUT US.p.s. be on the look out 9/13/2K3"
2,What happened?,"To tell you the truth, this should have been a great 2pac album. Pac's lyrics are always on par and very heartfelt, it's just that the production on this is horrible. If it was recorded pre-96, The music should sound pre-96, not this club-commercial garbage. The producers of this album were obviously too concerned with making it as marketable as possible, and not true to it's original form. The only track that I can see that hasn't been remixed from it's original version is ""They dont give a F about us"", which, IMO, just happens to also be the best track on both discs. It's hard, It's dark, it's nine-six, and sounds the way that it should sound. If you want to hear 2pac the way he should be heard, save yourself a headache and get the bootleg versions of these songs. This is the most horribly disfigured album yet."
4,better dayz iz a classic,"Better dayz is a classic just like every 2pac cd great lyrics, great beats and so inspirational the standout tracks have to be my block remix there u go and thugz mansion. If you're a 2pac fan you should buy the album as soon as you can. legendary material."
2,Not Good,"Look, I'm not one of those idiots that comes on the internet and mocks legends like 2pac, but to be honest I was disappointed with this album. I'm a huge fan of 2pac but this album just didn't feel like the other 2pac albums. I was disappointed with it and don't think it is worth the money. I gave it 2 stars because I might listen to cd 1 the odd time but I never listen to cd 2. So I'm gonna get straight to the point, you WILL be disappointed if u buy this album, even if u are a 2pac fan. I'm just giving my opinion and I hoped I helped."
1,FOR ROOKIES,"Man when i heard this sorry album i was like man i wouldnt even hear it cause is all remixes that sound dumb as hell plus they messed up all the the original i goota clasiffy this a hollywood commercial pac album for rookies that aint real pac fans so all you rookies suge knight must be laughin at yall for buyin this wack album and 10 more after this one that came out later, anyone real pac fan knows what im talkin about keep it real im 2000 g,S strong"
2,I think he's running out,Not many good songs on this set. I would really just skip over it unless you have 20 dollars to just blow.
2,"Sorry, But 2pac has to be Dead !!!","I don't believe that 2pac would ever rap with NAS or Jay Z or Tyrese. If your a true fan, you've heard lyrics. I have songs were he disses them just like biggie. well not tyrese, but he disses deangleo and i consider them too sing alike. Im a Huge Pac Fan, and i Like NAS / and a little jigga, but im not gonna buy this album. And some of these songs, i already have. and some that haven't been released. I totally agree with the other guy. Instead of this album, buy ""Until the End of Time""!!"
4,really remixed cd,"Ok i didn't buy the cd but I did download most of the songs off the net (not all, just some). I listened to them and found out that they added in new beats and that was a good improvement. Like i listened to the old thugz mansion version and it was totally different than the cd one. The lyrics were still the same (cept nas was on one of them) but the beats were changed. With the old version, it seemed the song was serious and dark but when they put in the guitar, which was nice, but completely changed the attitude of the song to happy or something. Anyways, I like the new beats than the old ones. The old ones seem so muffled and out of style. The new ones are clear crisp and in style. Like take My block for instance. The guitar is pretty nice than the keyboard or something."
5,best album his mom has put out,"It was worth the wait and delays. this cd has so many hard beats. disc 1 is incredible. ""still ballin"", ""when we ride on our enemies"", ""f*** em all"", ""street fame"" all have the best beats ive heard since all eyez on me. the only real bad song on disc 1 is ""thugz mansion"" with nas. why would his mom put nas on his cd. the beat is terrible and doesnt go with the lyrics. disc 2 isnt as good but has some tight songs. the best would be ""thugz mansion"". 2pac is so real on it and anthony hamilton did a good job on the chorus. if u dont believe 2pacs alive listen 2 the ""outro"". 2pac fans might be skeptical but this cd is one of his best. go and buy the cd and make one more 2pac cd #1.by 2pacs #1 fan"
5,the best tupac cd yet,ayo this cd is the best tupac cd yet im finna wait n see what is next in store for his releases and there will probably be some more hot stuff\commin from him
4,2PAC LIVES,"go to tupacfans.com and click on the ""is he alive?"" link. read the article and if you didn't believe he was alive before you may now. it made me a believer."
5,2pac can never be beating in albums,"It is amazing he made all these songs so quick and all of them are becoming hits. This album has something a little bit for everyone. The Intro was almost perfect and the whole cd is just a master piece. 2pac will most likely make other albums that past this one. If I did have to pic the best songs on here it be Thug Mansion (without Nas), Still Ballin, Street Fame, Catchin Feelins, This Life I Lead and the rest are pretty good. At the end of the album has a bonus track on the second disc and 2pac says ""Expect Me Ni*** Expect a Ni*** like you Expect Jesus to come back Expect me Ni*** I'm coming!"" what could he mean by that? But you know 2pac."
3,"Well, What can I say...","As always, Pac's lyrics is raw and full of emotion. The lyrics definatly get 5/5, but production is not good. Why can Afeni just release the originals, and stop making Pac sound so commercial? I prefer the original tracks, but others like the remixes i guess.~1~"
5,2Pac's Best After All Eyez On Me,"At first, I wasn't expecting much when I first bought Better Dayz from 2Pac. At most, I was expecting a gloomy album, where 2Pac's death was very evident. Instead, Better Dayz is full of fresh beats, smart rhymes, and leaves the listener with the feeling that 2Pac is still alive. After hearing this, many people will doubt whether 2Pac is truly dead. This CD isn't quite at the level of All Eyez On Me, but it's very close. Definately, a must-have."
4,"Maybe contrived, but still an awesome record","Why do people care if this record sounds contrived? Sure, there's no way that Nas would be on this record if Pac was alive, but that doesn't change the fact that the song is good. Maybe this CD would be a lot different if Pac had more of a hand in it, but it is still a 2Pac record and definitely worth owning, no matter what the ""2Pac purist"" reviewers say. If you have ever liked a 2Pac album, get this one, you won't be disappointed."
4,Johnny J,"I like every song produced by Johnny J. Just wonder why the record does not let 2pac's ""original produced"" songs relese????Because Pac and Johnny J spent a lot of time producing those songs."
3,"Tupac shines once again, Death Row production fails.","Lyrically this album is up there with Tupac's best work. You can definetely hear the maturity in his words as most of the tracks were done towards the end of his days. However, the production on this album is absolutely horrible. With the exception of a couple tracks, this sounds like something Puffy would put out. Tupac would never approve of these tracks, half of them sound the same. They do not have the rawness that Tupac fans are used to. I love Tupac and would think this album would be a 5 had it had some better production. Hopefully Death Row and Amaru will correct this on the next album due out next year."
4,THE LOST SONGS,I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IM A BIG PAC FAN I'VE HAD ALL THESE SONGS FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS MOST OF THEM COME FROM ONE NATION WITCH WAS NOT RELEASED I HAVE ABOUT 2 MORE OF PACS ALBUMS THAT ARE ALSO NOT AVAILABLE I WOULD SAY AS A FAN PICK THIS ALBUM UP.YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.IF ANYBODY INTERESTED IN ANY NEW SONGS EMAIL ME. IM OUGHT PEACE.
2,Don't waste your time or money,"I never thought I'd see the day where I would give a bad review to a 2pac album. This album is 20% good material, 80% mediocre filler. There's probably a reason why this material wasn't released on the Makaveli album or any of the subsequent releases - it's not as good. Much of the remixes sound worse than the originals. Johnny J produced some decent R&Bish tracks, but the remixes try to hard to catch up to modern day production. The originals were much better. Unless you're a loyal 2pac fan, save your money and skip this album. It's just not as good."
2,SCREW CORPERATE AMERICA!!!!!!!!111,"This year the evil record business have been making a sad,sad attempt to make money off two musical legends of the 1990'S, those two men are Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur. While Cortney Love has been making change off Cobain's Nirvana album and his PERSONAL JOURNALS, Suge Knight is making money off Tupac releases that have been on bootleg since 1997.Most of the songs are the original songs. Like Until the End of Time, most of these songs were tracks Tupac thew together and never wanted to be released in the first place. Maybe there just trying to get new fans into Tupac or trying to make money off his legacy with songs that can be found on ebay with Makaveli(2,3,4,5 and 7).Nas on a Tupac song? Please. This is just as worst as Biggies Born Again.Don't buy this if your just getting into Tupac, pick up All Eyez On Me and The 7 Day Theory. If your a die-hard Pac fan, and dont own the bootlegs, I guess its worth a shot."
4,Let it Go..,"First let me say that i love Tupac's music. He is one of the top 5 mc's of all time...no question. The problem with Better Dayz is that most of these songs were leaked years ago and people are still trying to get paid off this man. There are tracks on here that still target Biggie and Mobb Deep. These joints are old and should not be released again. Yeah, the music to the album is hot but these are outdated Tupac lyrics....didn't he talk about George Bush Sr. and clinton on this joint....let the man rest in peace..da#n..."
3,"Stop producin Pac's Mom! Better Dayz, indeed does need better production.","Still Ballin? - With Trick Daddy(Im from the 305 myself and the song is good but WTF?) My favorite is they don't give a F*** about Us"", and some others, cd is good but not great, anytime you re-make the songs instead of the original you lose the appeal of the songs, stop producing pac's Mama! and stop doing collabos with whack rappers! and R&B."
5,I Love This CD,"This CD is off the chain as anything by 'Pac should be, and contains many of my favorite hip- hop tracks of all time. Tupac conveys a rebellious, angry, and even violent side on some tracks, and then softens and slows down others. My personal fav songs are 'My Block (Remix)', 'Fame' feat. The Outlawz, 'Still Ballin'' , 'When We Ride On Our Enemies', 'Mama's Just A Little Girl', 'Better Dayz', 'Thugz Mansion (Accoustic Version)' feat. Nas and J. Phoenix, and the main version of 'Thugz Mansion' feat. Anthony Hamilton. I love all the tracks, and I need to listen more thoroughly to some of them. I listed 8 of of my favs, however, and you should listen to those right when you cop the CD, unless you like to listen to CDs straight through. This s**t is tite!"
3,Where are the beats?,Yeah the the lyrics are still brilliant but where have the beats gone? i don't think that the producers should have tried to modernise the music by taking out the hard beats he used to have and put in little tapping sounds in some songs. they should have made it more like the rap from before 96 with a mixture of beats and music as this album seems to be 80% music and 20% proper beats. if you are a fan though you should buy the album but it could have been better.
5,Disc 2 is a Classix own it's own,"I remember when me and my homeboy listened to this when it came out 2002, this album is off the chain. The 1st disc is ok, but the 2nd disc is as good as any 2pac album made since he was alive or dead. Never Call u B. Again, U Can Call, Better Dayz, Fame, Who do u Believe In, are classics and thats why some of them are on the new 2pac greatest hits album released in 2007."
3,3.5 Stars,"Better Dayz is a very diverse album, it is full of filler material such as the atrocious production of Jazze Pha and pointless songs with people like Mya and Trick Daddy, but it does have its gems, songs like Thugz Mansion (both versions), Better Dayz and My Block are just some of the songs that make this 2Pac album a must have."
5,ONE OF TUPAC'S BEST EVER,"This album is awesome. The stand-out tracks include ""Still Ballin'"", ""When We Ride On Our Enemies"", ""Changed Man"", ""Never Be Peace"", ""Mama's Just A Little Girl"", ""Street Fame"", ""What Ya Gonna Do"", ""My Block (Remix)"", ""Thug's Mansion"", ""Military Minds"", ""Fair Exchange (Remix)"" & ""They Don't Give A F**k About Us"". The worst songs are ""Thug's Mansion (Nas Acoustic)"", ""Never Call You B***h again"", ""Better Days"" & ""Late Night"". This album features 2Pac's singles ""Thug's Mansion (Nas Acoustic"" & ""Still Ballin'"". Overall this is a fantastic album. If you are a big 2Pac fan (like I am) then you should definitely get this album. If you do not have any 2Pac albums get Greatest Hits, then get this."
5,2pac better dayz,If you like tupac go buy the album i think it's good The only bad thing about it is that they put nas on it and they were enemies they made it look like they were firends and they weren't but over all it's good go get it
2,Only for the realist,Tupac knows how to lay it down. He is the king of the double CD. There is no other poet out there like him.
3,Better Dayz Review,"I'm a BIG Tupac fan! I may be one of his biggest fans. But honestly I'm not really feeling this Better Dayz album. The lyrics and everything is nice,but it doesn't go with some of the beats. It sounds like most of the beats are from a R&B/Techno CD. R.I.P. Tupac,and hopefully next album we can get something like your old material(beat wise)."
3,Unreleased Songs!,I luv 2pac. I have all his cds and have downloaded every unreleased song I could find onto my MP3 player. Almost every single song on this album I downloaded last year.
3,"Easily the best 'Pac album after his passing, April 12, 2006","Easily the best 'Pac album after his passing, April 12, 2006Reviewer: David Foskin (Waterford, Ireland)*************************DID YOU READ THIS GUYS REVIEW FROM """"""IRELAND"""""""" C'MON!!!!! OH MY GOODNESS I AM PISSED!!!! THE BEST PAC ALBUM AFTER HIS PASSING???? THIS IS SOME BULL%$#$%^&*^^* MAN F**^ THIS GUY STUPID @#$%^^&* DA@#%^*!!!! OK, OK, OK IM COOH NOW! IF YOU LOVE PAC'S STYLE AND LYRICS AND KNOW WHAT HE WAS BEFORE HIS DEATH (LYRICLY) THAN YOU WOULD REALLY LOVE ""R U STILL DOWN (REMEMBER ME)"". DAVID FOSKIN MUST HAVE NOT HEARD THIS ALBUM (MIGHT I SAY IT WAS PRODUCED BY AFINI HERSELF)....please someone calm me down before i have to go to waterford ireland!!!!!!"
1,need you ask why?,"Same as ""50 cents"", same as ""God's Son"" all the same music same lyrics, same everything, only difference is your 13 dollars shorter than you were before from buying it. Hail the Repetitive king! Gangsta's!"
1,What the h@ll?!,I heard these songs back in 1996 on bootleg Makaveli tapes in California and I wish I still had them because the beats were different than the wack production I'm hearing on this trash. The bootlegs had beats that were probably the original tracks Tupac had for these songs and they were tight as hell. What you get on this mainstream version is pure garbage. Tupac would have never used these beats for ANY song. He's cursing these niccas out in his grave for mutilating his songs. I broke this CD into a million pieces. This is not Pac!
2,THESE SONGS ARE NOT NEW!!!,"I just want to let everyone out there know that this music is not new and that there aren't any new 2pac songs on it. If you're as big a 2pac fan as I am you will wait til June 7, 2003 and see what happens. Makaveli tha Don Lives on.Peace out. Westside for Life!"
4,Another 2pac double album,"2pac's newest double album is great. I know there are plenty of remixed tracks and new beats that just don't match Pac's style but as long as they were catchy I didn't care.The best tracks include Still Ballin', Late Night, Whatcha Gonna Do, When We Ride On Our Enemies, Thugz Mansion,and They Don't Give A ****. Disc 1 is the best and Disc two is decent.There are some tracks on here I disliked but other than that Better Dayz holds up pretty good.My next question is this: ""Will Pac STILL have dozens more of unrelesed tracks so another double album will be released?..."""
4,Very good album with some change of attitude,This album has good beats and rhymes but I've noticed that it is a lot less agressive than past Tupac albums...there seems to be a complete change of attitude...seemingly more positive and whatnot...I like the second disc a lot more than the first one..the one thing I don't like this album is that it is kind of repetitive..and I agree..where are is all this new material coming from?...
4,taste great,Taste better than other honeys. I only wish it wouldn't crystalize so quickly. And it leaked some on shipping.
1,vamps and witches,"I will keep this short as the other reviews were quite long. I am no expert movie critic but I watch tons of horror and skinimax films. This set of movies were horrible! Out of the 5-6 hours of film, about 15 min were what you would expect. Don't waste money on this pathetic mess."
1,No Entertainment Value-Cheap and Dismal,"When you buy 4 movies for $10 you are not expecting much. Even with low expectations these 4 movies were still very disappointing! They look like they were filmed in Film-Making 101 class. I tried to watch the movies a second time, to make sure I was not being overly critical, I was not. I honestly threw the set in the trash after a second attempt to watch the movies. Amazon has many good movies available, don't waste your time/money on these."
2,Drek... but decide for yourself!,"The content of this DVD is amazingly awful. However, there are four full-length examples of that drek!So, if your favorite restaurant is the kind of place that serves terrible food but makes up for it by serving huge portions, Vamps and Witches might belong in your collection! Otherwise, beware!"
5,"Stark and beautiful, deep and inscrutable","There isn't much I can say about these poems in the way of explantion--that is, not without taking away any of the lingering resonance that they exude upon the reader. I will tell you that this is truly great, original poetry, written in lines that, though they are often quite free free verse, rank very highly on the memorability scale. Carol Frost, I assure you, will someday be considered a great and important poet, a poet of nature, bodies, myths--and with this book of new & selected poems, she is well on her way. Reading her work is a sometimes humbling experience, though it will leave you grateful.Let me leave you with a half dozen or so of my favorite pieces: ""Waking,"" ""Flicker,"" ""Sin,"" ""Pure,"" ""Scorn,"" ""Apple Rind,"" ""To Kill a Deer."""
1,"Dangerous and disgusting, do not buy this for your pet","This product is dyed with some cheap chemical, in huge quantities. If you touch it, your hands will turn the color of the ball. If you touch it with a wet hand, you will be brightly dyed for 3 days. Luckily we realized this before our bunny poisoned himself. This is a disgusting and dangerous product that will hurt your pet. This amount of dye is obscene and unnecessary. Obviously unsafe."
4,Entertaining. Regency Period at its best,"I enjoyed reading A Spledid Indiscretion. The author truly captures the regency period. I believe the main character, Ada S., would drive one insane with her constant forgetfulnes and daydreaming. The library scene towards the end was funny, I could easily imagine it in a movie.The Grand Passion is entertaining. I was suprised how the story unfolded toward the end and enjoyed the book. Im excited to read more of her books, (I just wish I would have known about this author earlier) She truly is talented and understands the regency period quite well."
5,Great music at a great price,I really liked the series that this CD is part of there are quite a number of themed classical CD's that St. Claire puts out. It is really nice for a person relatively new to classical to put on a CD and hear something themed to your mood. I find it a effective and entertaining way to be introduced to the wonders of great classical music.
5,Just What I Needed!,I purchased a deluxe Wilton set (baked goods decorating tips) recently and found out I needed a large tip coupler for the bigger tips in my set. It fit perfectly so I was very pleased! I wish the Wilton set came with the large coupler to begin with.
3,Sorta Works...,"I bought this item as part of the ""Frequently Purchased Together"" combo, which also included the Ateco 6-Piece tip set and the Ateco Plastic Coated Decorating Bag. It's great, as long you only use the three smaller tips in the set. The other three are too large for this ""large"" coupler.The problem is that in order to make this thing work in your bag, you need to trim off the bag at the opening until a couple of the adapter's threads are visible. After you get the opening large enough to accommodate the coupler, you still have to force it into the hole, making it next to impossible to extract, which is what you would need to do in order to remove the adapter and install the large tips by themselves.My guess is that if you intend to use the large tips, that you may want to purchase a second bag and cut the opening to size to accommodate your larger tips. This adapter just isn't up to the task. <sigh>"
1,broke with first use,"This coupler starter cracking at the outside edge the very first time I used it. I got 3 or 4 uses out of it, and now it has cracked to the point where the tips won't stay in."
1,the Four Treasures of Alan Shawn Feinstein,"[...] Some of his advise in his financial advise columns include ""If you need money, have a garage sale"" He is a self proclaimed humantarian. For those thousands upon thousands of people he has [...],used or taken advantage of, humanitarian is not the word that should be used. His self published advise articles include...Send me [$$$] and I will send you a secret"" The secret being that at a certain time and date everyone who sent him the money was supposed to go outside and send ""good thoughts"" into the atmosphere to encourage anything or anyone out there in the universe to make contact with us lowly human beings. This book is a[...]just like his other publications."
5,"Aunts, Godmothers, Grandmothers and Parents",A terrific easy to read book that opened my eyes to the challenges girls face. More importantly though I learned skills that I can use with my grandaughters and nieces. A great gift for women.... and men.
5,This book will change your life and your nieces lives!!,"I received this book as a gift from my sister in law. It was so powerful!! I have two nieces and didn't realize that simple steps can reap such incredible benefits. I highly reccomend ""For All Our Daughters"" It is a great gift!! I was glad to receive it!"
1,Not impressed,Most of this video is a naration with still pictures stating what number the mistake is. Very disappointing. I was looking for a video and recieved more of a slide show.
3,Goods and bads!,"I love the look of this case and I bought it because I needed something that could take a bit of a beating. I was a little disappointed in the locking mechanism and in the strength of the case... one of my team members stepped on it and one side is completely deformed and the metal is sharp and a little dangerous. Despite all that I like mine a lot, and it does protect my CDs!"
4,Best Modern-Day Texas Fiddle Band,"Asleep at the Wheel is the best modern Texas fiddle band in existance. You may know it as Western Swing, but it is what it is...Though not as good as the originals, the recordings benefit from today's recording technoligy."
5,Discover a Great Band,Very Best of Asleep at the WheelGreat starting point to get behind the 'Wheel' or to rediscovery what a great band they are. Excellent songs in the Texas swing tradition. Asleep at the Wheel should have a spot in every music fans collection.
5,The Very Best of The Best,Ray Benson went through The Wheel catalog and picked out their most requested and beloved songs. All of these songs were re-recorded at the end of 2000 and beginning of 2001. These versions are just as good if not better than the original versions and Ray is the main vocal on every track. A most worthy pickup for any long-time fan or any newbies just discovering the Kings of Western Swing. Ahhaaaa!
2,Are you feeling HOT HOT HOT,Used it for 10 minutes - got hotter than the dickens. Returned it for a Dewalt 505. Much better.
2,Bosch factory reconditioned means beat-up and rusty,"I've bought a lot of reconditioned products from other manufacturers before and always found them to be hard to tell from new. Not so with Bosch. My hammer drill came with a rusty chuck, dirt & scratches, and the case was all beat-up. I contacted CPO Bosch and never heard back. If you want like-new, stay away from Bosch factory reconditioned."
3,Some fresh ideas,"This was an okay book. I got it from the library which is what I suggest you do. It has great photos which help you learn things such as clothing your baby, holding your baby, swaddling your baby, bathing your baby and more. Most of the photos are just fun to look at. I read this book after reading many other baby care books but it offered some new ideas for care which I now use. The only problem with this book is that it shows babies lying on their sides or stomach to sleep which is not recommended because of the increased risk of SIDS. Babies should be placed on their back. Keep that in mind and the book is a good read."
5,Good read,"Always enjoy reading good Sandra Brown books! This is one of her older, shorter story books. This book is really hard to put down."
2,Disturbing but a good writer,"Really loved the book, up until about the last third when it turned disturbing. The heroine came across as a desperate stalker and I was left wondering if perhaps the accident she was in that killed the Hero's wife wasn't really an accident at all and this woman is so psychotic that she has convinced herself that it was....I would read this author again because I did like her writing style, but hopefully the next book comes across better. Will aim for one of her more recent books next time."
3,Texas! Chase,I purchased this book to finish out the Tyler Family Saga. Was happy to see the whole family settled and happy.
4,Chase on the Run,"Chase Tyler was so overcome with grief when his wife and unborn baby were killed in a car accident that he ran. He ran away from the family business and his memories and became a rodeo man. Riding bulls and drinking until he couldn't feel anymore was the only way he could survive until he was injured and a lady from his past came back into his life. Marcie Johns had known Chase since they were kids and was driving the car when it killed his wife. She had always loved him, but now he needed her. He needed her to make him stop running and be a man again. She made him an offer that would save the family business and was a gamble with her heart.The story is good, even if a little predictable. Sandra Brown seems to be afraid to break out of the traditional romance mold, even though she keeps crossing the line, and then jumping back within the boundaries. You know the next in the series will be even better!"
4,"Gorgeous pictures and good advice, but limited use","While this gardening book is lovely to look at and has some very good essays, it needs to be pointed out that the information is basically geared toward Western gardeners. Much of it can be adapted, but many of the plants pictured won't grow in my ""difficult"" climate, the South."
2,Older Recordings,Mozart in the rain from this publisher was much better. Many of the selections on this CD sound like they are rather old recordings. I also do not think the pieces chosen from Tchaikovsky were some of the better choices to use along with rain sounds.
4,The jury is out... this filmmaker likes it,"Obviously people have mixed opinions of this book. I liked the in-depth info, the readability and the color plates. I'm a director who is interested in learning more about cinematography from that angle. The Filmmaker's Handbook on Plume, or Bordwell and Thompson's Film Art will cover a lot of the same info for a cheaper price, but I like this book's illustrations and more advanced technical info, especially on video. Ultimately you gotta go out and do it, a book will only go so far. But as books go I find this one pretty great."
2,Outdated technical principles...,"Just skimming through the book I immediately lost interest in the art of filmmaking itself. I wish it showed more examples of some of the best cinematography from the great filmmakers and not overcomplicate the whole process of cinematography. I mean, I understand that when you move to industry style sets you'd have to deal with bigger toys, but I could care less on how to use these particular toys; I would love to learn why and how I should light, with almost anything and tapping that creative source for improvising, mostly for independent filmmaking. That should be the audience anyways, the independent filmmaker: if you're in the industry already, you wouldn't need this kind of book since you can already learn on the job how those gizmos work. Ehh...frustrated..."
3,Nice overall but not great,"It's a good book. I wasnt impressed by the way the author writes, but it seems to cover the basics. Too much technical stuff for what I was expecting: more analysis of existing movies, but I guess that's up to you after you read the book."
5,Best Cinematography Book Ever!,This book answered all the questions I had on the subject that no other resource could. Great book for any aspiring filmmaker novice or semi-pro.
2,Sections are poorly written and full of errors,"The book has a lot of useful information in it. Unfortunately, it could have used a copy editor and someone to verify all of the information in it. There are A LOT of typographical errors. I spent a great deal of my time verifying what was written in the book in other texts after I discovered several errors. Depth of field/depth of focus, come on, please proofread. The book also makes explanations more convoluted and unclear than necessary. Again, I referred to Malkiewicz (the edition with David Mullen-a very good example of someone who writes clearly and intelligently about cinematography), The Filmmakers Handbook and notes from my introductory cinematography class to untangle what Brown was tangling.The book is not up to Focal's high standards. Please hire an editor for the next edition and actually incorporate the corrections to the text that readers submit. Conceptually, the book is disorganized. Please consider an outline for the next edition."
5,Great Product,"Delivery was very prompt. Installation was a snap, less than 5 minutes. Quality appears to be very good. I bought it because we couldn't hear the doorbell from our family room in the basement. Works great. Volume control is a nice feature as is the fact that it is portable. Very much worth the cost."
5,Great product!,Took me less than five minutes to set up and it works like a charm. The original bell in is located in the kitchen which is in the back of the house. I placed this in front of the house and no issues whatsoever! I highly recommend this product!!
4,Extra doorbell,This is the best one I could find. I wanted a different ring for the front and back doors. This is very easy to install. I do wish the ringing part was electric but it runs on batteries so if you just sit it on a shelf it can be moved around. Works really good.
5,"Easy to install, works as advertised","Purchased the Lamson extend-a-bell based on reading others recommendations. I'm not a handyman, and usually break things when trying. However, installing this extend-a-bell was easy as pie. All I had to do was hook one wire to ""front"" and one on ""Transformer"", both inside my existing doorbell. Two wire hookup and bam, it worked. I also purchased the Thomas & Betts #RC3733D PlugIn Add ChimReceiver and it worked flawlessly with this unit. In fact, it played my selected doorbell ring of ""jingle bells"", just as was selected on the main unit. I'm very satisifed with my purchased. I really like that it is hard wired and not simply a ""listen"" for the doorbell to ring type model. Having it hardwired in prevents false alarms from thing like barking dogs, loud noises, etc. Very happy, great product. I also like that it is weather resistent and can go outside with me on the patio when need be. It operated on 4 ""C"" batteries."
4,could have given 5 but ...,"not good music tones. The volumes and other options are hidden beside a transparent plastic. In order to change the volume or the tone, you need to tool to open it. Moreover, that plastic cannot be replaced after removing.Otherwise, good product works 99% of time :)"
5,Mary Ann and Bill.,"Loved this, laughed about poor puppy Bill and how Mary Ann ends up loving him and writing stories about him. The Twins got up to thier usaul mischief and poor Corny also got in over his head."
5,beautiful!,"Two girls have all kinds of active adventures ranging from cutting wood and building a house to driving a truck and putting out a fire. The Dream intervals are fantastic- I love the giant ice-cream sundae that they eat togther! A great book about all the things that girls can do and the power of friendship. Beautiful detailed illustrations, also. Minimal text on each page means even toddlers can pay attention till the end."
3,Together,The book is fine but I was disappointed to discover that it was actually a library book. I'm wondering what the deal is and certainly hope that people don't make a habit of selling books if they actually belong to a library.
5,Nice colors and good stickiness,"These post-it pads are a great size for making lists and checking them twice. The colors are pretty and you can still clearly see blue ink on them, which isn't always true of some of the colorful post-its. They stick well. I brought some to work and have some in my home office."
3,Image not representative,"My other 4-pad post-it packs came in 4 different colors, which I thought I was going to get. Both the images for the 5x8 2-pad pack and the 5x8 4-pad pack showed 2 colors only. The image shows orange and yellow; fortunately I got orange and neon green (which is better) but I would have preferred 4 different colors."
4,Not as sticky as other Post-it notes,"I'm in love with Post-it notes. I have bought basically every size and type they have put out.I don't know if it was just this batch, or this particular size and shape of Post-it note, but I want to warn consumers that these notes do not stick nearly as well as any other Post-it note.The size is excellent for specific purposes; in my case, making lists. I prefer this notepad to the ones that are longer in width than in height. Please just be aware that they may not stick as well as what you used to."
4,Good Movie Bad Technicals,"If you like animation, Simpsons, family guy, etc. This will be up your alley. On the other hand there aren't special features, previews, extra flair. The animation and voiceover work is also not all that technically sound. I'm not sure I totally buy the voice with the images. Get past these minor flaws and enjoy a slightly stereotypically animated comedy."
1,disappointing product!,"The Farberware bar and wine winged corkscrew is cheaply made, poorly designed, and a generally disappointing product. It doesn't center easily on the cork, seemingly always entering on an angle, it feels ""tinny"" in hand, and the cork is virtually impossible to remove from the screw once one has wrestled it out of the bottle. Need I say more........do not waste your money!! Very disappointed in a Faberware product!"
4,Non-complicated - straight forward to use.,"I've had one of these for 10 yrs, when that broke I started to look for a new one.While you have quite a few fancy choices these days, they are either too bulky or battery operated.I'd say if you want simple non-complicated stuff, easy to stow away - go for this.If you are someone who has health issues or who does not have enough muscle strength for whatever reason, orlovesfancy - battery operated one is the way."
1,Not happy with this product,"This item definitely saves counter space and was inexpensive, but those are the only good things about it. The toaster takes forever to even lightly toast. The coffee maker works fine, but the valve on the filter reservoir broke-off after only a few weeks. Poor quality of the product is a shame because it's a great idea."
2,Cheap,"Cheaply made, not recommended. The top of the coffee maker was crooked, looked cheap, sent it back."
4,Perfect appliance,Just exactly what I wanted. I had a very small counter space and need a toaster and a coffee pot. This fill the bill exactly.
1,A Useless Rehash of Previously Issued DVDs,"I agree, there is no reason for this release. It is just a rehash of previous US DVD releases. It is not a true ""Ruth Rendell"" collection, as it omits the UK broadcast episodes ""Talking to Strange Men"", ""The Strawberry Tree"". ""Heartstones"" and ""Thornapple"". It also fails, as it includes episodes 21-23 of the ""Inspector Wexford"" mysteries, all previously issued several times, but again ignores the first 20 episodes of this great series. So... Acorn has re-released the same 17 DVDs they and others released before and still haven't released the other 24 episodes that were shown on UK tv. BIG WHOOP!"
1,Acorn Are You Listening....,"It's a shame so much production time and money is spent re-releasing the same ole material. It's obvious the Rendell series are in high demand, just read the reviews!! Since all British mystery series are high in demand on dvd and the Wexford tv series is long overdue for release, you'd think Acorn would spend money more wisely and boost their sales by releasing NEW material and stop dropping us in it with incomplete series releases."
1,Not my cup of tea,"Did not expect this sad selection of anti-heroes who may be either victims or enablers to plots that consistently defy justice.The production and acting is of good English quality but is not enough to overcome these sorry stories.There is sufficient sex or sex related violence in each episode to satisfy those voyeuristically inclined.The price of this collection is too high, after watching half of the shows I said enough and have put it a way forever."
5,Rendell Fan,"I have only watched two of the collection so far but have been delighted with those two. One thing that is very nice touch is that each mystery is in three parts. Therefore, one is able to watch for an hour, or two or threeI have only watched the first two mysteries in the collection. I am delighted with those and would highly recommend them to anyone who likes Ruth Rendell and or English Mysteries.One nice touch is that each story is divided into three parts so one is able to watch for an hour or two or three, as time allows.These mysteries are so compelling that I believe I may have ""hooked"" my husband into watching them with me. No easy task, taking him away from Football!!!"
1,An unbelieveable heroine and just plain awful prose.,"I'm a big fan of Barbara Michaels (and her Elizabeth Peters mysteries too), but this book was a major disappointment. I read it twice, several months apart, to determine whether I might have been mistaken the first time, but it was just as awful the second time. I applaud her sentiments in creating a heroine who is not gorgeous, but she goes too far--Heather is portrayed as genuinely unattractive, making the subsequent romantic stuff unbelievable. And the prose is leaden; the plot dull and warmed over (how many times do we want to read this witchery stuff rehashed?); the premise (Heather being welcomed into the family for no other reason than her name)implausible."
3,A little disappointing,"This book started out great! I love Barbara Michaels in all of her incarnations, and I didn't want to put this one down. I didn't put it down, in fact, until I finished it, but I was terribly let down at the end. Not only did I have the guilty party figured out almost from the beginning, but a number of plot lines were never explained or expanded. This story definitely needed an epilogue to tie up the loose ends."
4,Another good one from Barbara MIchaels,"Ms. Michaels is one of my favorite authors. This is not her best, but I did enjoy it."
4,A very entertaining read!,"The main character, Heather Tradescant, is a wonderful change of pace from the impossibly beautiful, waif-thin 18 year olds of many mystery/romance novels. I was very entertained by Heather and her experiences at Troytan House. This book was suspenseful and kept my interest right up to the end; however, I was surprised by the number of loose ends that were never explained. Perhaps Heather Tradescant will get a sequel? All in all, I enjoyed the book and plan to read more of Barbara Michaels' work."
3,"Wicca, England and a large living Maze","Ok I really didn't like this one. I thought I would by the writing on the back but I should have just rented it. It is supposed to be a romance but I didn't figure out the romance part until the end.There is intrigue and a lot of interesting information about Wicca and how it effects this one town in England. But, I found the whole story to be a bit far fetched.Maybe the abridged version of the story was just a bit to abridged!"
3,Not one of her best,"I read this book as part of my book club and was disappointed with the story. The last 20 or so pages were the best in the book, and I kept reading, hoping it would get better. The hint of romance doesn't develop until the end and I would have liked to have had more background in to that. Not a bad read, but some of her others are better."
1,Keep Looking...,"I have several other silicone spatulas, and this Kitchenaid scraper is, by far, the worst I've used. Most silicone scrapers are soft and flexible, but this one is very stiff and rigid, so you cannot scrape containers out very well at all. Honestly, it doesn't even appear to be made of silicone. Cheap grocery store spatulas work much better than this one. Very disappointing."
3,beware of water,"I bought this scraper (along with a whole set of KitchenAid utensils) as a birthday gift for my mom, she loves it. She cooks a lot and it's already been put to great use. I like that it can with-stand very high heats. The only thing that she and I do not like about this product it that the handle retains water when used in the dishwasher. Depending on the type of dishwasher that you have you can probably put it on the top rack and it will be okay but otherwise you might be using it when yucky water leaks out.Otherwise a great product - especially if you have time to do all of your dishes by hand."
5,Best Scraper Spatula!,Look no further! This is yet again another superb silicone spatula by KitchenAid. The large handle makes it easy to get a firm grip on it when you are stirring or scraping. The silicone spatula is flexible but not flimsy. It will not melt or fray and it couldn't be easier to clean. Don't bother trying to lick the bowl because you won't miss a drop of anything with this spatula. Very Highly recommended! A+!
5,As always THE BEST !!!,"I have the long handled and a short handled and am about to purchase another one. As always Kitchen Aid has made another great product! They do not deteriorate like the cheaper products, are able to withstand high temps, keep their color( they don't stain) , come apart for easy cleaning and storage. Their handles are very tough, sturdy, I don't have to worry about the handle breaking when scraping a heavy bread dough. They just simply work very well , and they are very reasonably priced."
2,Disappointed with KitchenAid this time...,"I have this scraper and after just a few uses, it fell apart at the connection in the center. Normally, I rave about KitchenAid, but this product was truly a disappointment."
4,All the charm and terror of an old Southern manse,"""South of the Ohio River there is no such thing as old news or ancient history.""That's the sort of sensibility that informs Cherie Priest's Four & Twenty Blackbirds. If you've ever been in one of those forlorn remote spaces of the South where the trees hum with birds and bugs of every stripe and the sun comes down a bright hot yellow that makes the shade seem even darker than it ought, Cherie Priest will probably sound like someone you know. If not, Cherie Priest is someone you should get to know.There's a lot here to like. It's a ghost story, shaded and textured with a mish-mash of forgotten and shunned magics. It's about family, and the ties that brace, bind and strangle. And it's all colored with takes on race, the Old South/New South decay/rejuvenation and saucy observations of people and their own particular places."
4,Difficult to put it down,"I picked up this book on impulse, and I was not sure if I would enjoy this genre. Pleasantly, I could not put this book down. This is a quick, interesting, and fun read!"
4,Chilling,"I don't normally like the word ""engrossing,"" but it does describe this book. I could not put it down! The setting is richly detailed and compelling, and the narrorator's sense of alienation was sympathy-inducing rather than whiney. What makes it really great horror is that it only steps over into implausible, not going so far as to be impossible, and that makes for a definate, up-all-night with the lights on read."
5,The Wonderment,"This book is great - let's leave it at that. Don't want to be spoiling the mystery, suspense and forests, now do we?The short story at the end is great, too."
3,Interesting-With Flaws,"The writing was decent and definitely held my interest. The storyline moved along nicely. Most of the characters well developed, though not always likeable. The only thing I didn't like was the main character, Eden's, attitude. She's kind of a snotty brat and during the action sequences I could almost picture her in a ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"" episode. I don't think she should have been this scared little ingenue but a little sympathy and compassion would have been enhanced her personality."
5,Worth reading.,"This is the first book in a long time that I stayed up way too late to finish. It was excellent. I love gothic horror, and this one manages to hit on three of my favorite themes - dysfunctional family history, ghosts and insane asylums. Besides that, it's well-written. I can't believe this is the author's first book - most first books aren't this smooth of a read."
5,A book that reminds you why you enjoy reading..,"This book is simply one of the most pleasing books to read that I've laid my hands on. It works on all levels, its a crime novel, a horror novel, a thriller, suspense. Whichever genre of book that you enjoy there is something to enjoy here - with a fluid and easy writing style that makes you turn the pages - and means you won't put this book down until you're finished. The well developed characters lead you along a twisting and mysterious path, never quite letting you see the end, but letting you glimpse its shadow through the trees. This is the kind of book that wins awards. Three words - Buy This Book."
3,Entertaining and different,"A well-written, mystery story with a female protagonist who sees ghosts.I have never read a ghost story quite like this. It takes place in the southern United States and many of the main characters are African American or bi-racial. The protagonist, Eden, is a strong character who was used to being different, not just for her ethnicity, but because of her special ability to speak to the dead. I think this made her drive and her strength more believable.I didn't get into this at first because the story starts with Eden as a child and I was kind of bored. I am so glad that I kept reading! The story quickly progresses through Eden's childhood and the pacing picks up.I enjoyed the prose and the southern voice in this novel. If she writes another book, I will read it."
5,a fun read,"The protagonist of Four and Twenty Blackbirds, Eden, is a spirited young lady. Really. The evidence is in her ghostly entourage and the quest they lead her on.Robust characters, strong imagery, and a knack for narrating physical events distinguish Ms. Priest?s freshman novel from the kiddie pool of fledgling writers."
4,Great Start in a New Series,Pulled me in from the first page and kept me there until I finished the book. I liked it so much I went ahead and ordered the next two books in the Eden Moore series.
5,"Great Read, Even for Someone New to the Genre","The first sign of a great book: when you find yourself heavily invested in the main character by chapter two.4&20BB is a delightfully easy, but wonderfully captivating read. The author isn't giving you 3 paragraphs of detail just to describe a coffee table in an abandoned building, but uses her words economically and carefully to effectively deliver a feel for the environment.I'll be honest, I have never read the horror/suspense genre until now. But on the recommendation of a friend I picked up the book and am truly thankful I did. If you, like me, want to pick up a good book and escape for a bit, living thru the world of a compelling heroine, this book will not disappoint. I look forward to her next installment."
2,sorry,"but I cannot see what all of the fuss was about, I bought this book based on the glorious reviews and it did not come out shining."
5,would buy from again,My daughter needed this book for school but she wound up really liking it so it was a success in my book
4,Not as good as her Steampunk books BUT! Good :),"This is Cherie Priest's first novel and as such, has a few rough patches. However, I still really liked it. One thing Priest always does well, especially in her steampunk offerings, is write a pretty sentence and builds atmosphere - that's evident here. When very young, Eden gets a bit of a shock when 3 female ghosts appear to her the 1st time. As she grows up, they appear a few more times (stress/danger), throw in some weird dreams, attempts on her life by a religious zealot, and very complex family tree/history and that is the basis for this tale (book 1 in series). As I said, it's not perfect; certain story threads get a bit...kinked at convenience and some explanations are either overdone or overly convenient. Still, if you like a bit of Southern Gothic in your speculative fiction, give it a whirl - I found it enjoyable and fun."
3,Good first novel,"This is the first time I've read Priest. It was good enough that I may come back to her, but not so good as to guarantee it. A big part of the problem is the main character. She's just too feisty and imperturbable. It's impossible to let yourself get scared or even excited by a book when the main character is unfazed by any threat, natural or supernatural. I'm also baffled by her complete dismissal of a cold-blooded murder that happens right in front of her.There was one scene I found to be scary -- and it was quite scary. But now that I've finished the book, I don't know why that scene was included. The book also needed some better editing. There are entire paragraphs where the narrator is simply restating the same thing in different ways.Those are my gripes. It is a good story, and an interesting world Priest has created. I am curious to see more of it, but not right away."
5,makes you wonder....,"a little slow to start, but then couldn't put the book down! Cross between a detective and adventure story. Makes you wonder about many things in the realities of life. Definitely and interesting author! will look for more books by R.E.Starr!"
3,"Weak in terms of proportion, Not impressive as a figure","This Wolverine is a dead on with the current costume in the comics.I just have problem with its proportion: Body is too small,Its feet is too flat.Its like Wolverine on a girly diet.I have the unmasked version because I like the head sculpt....so what I did was to customise it with the body of the old Tiger stripe Wolverine from the X-men line,and put some steel claws and the result was an awesome Unmasked Wolverine version."
2,Is this a ToyBiz figure or a cheap D.C. figure???????,Well un less you want to build Apocalyps I can see why you would buy this figure but if you see it in the store not aware of the Apocalyps series I cant tell why you would buy this figue but people say its good so you can belive them but I dont reccomend this figureThanks
1,UNHAPPY,"I kept entering that I wanted a FULL screen version of ""Pay it Forward"" and this selection kept coming up. I could not see if it was full or wide view, I asumed it would be full view since that is what I had entered.Not everyone has HD TV."
2,movie 1,Waited to watch this movie and only 1 side was good other side all marked up and would jump. Did not want to spend the time or money to return it. This was a new movie but think it was a damaged when it was made.
5,A beautifuly sung version with absolutely clear German diction,Like your other reviewer I found this in a bargain bin many years back - I prefer it to new versions without native German speaking voices and the difference is palpable. The accompaniment is hauntingly beautiful. One of my favourite Christmas CDs that needs to be far better known and played more often. It puts less familiar parts of the broader Christmas story to lovely music.
1,Too horrible to listen too.,This is hideous! I am South American and dumb founded of what the heck this is. It's under the title of Andean yet the CD cover has a a Mexican stone head of some kind and monctezuma is one of the songs. But despite this the music is enough to push you to suicide. This is a travesty. South American music my foot! I broke my CD so no one would be subjected to it.Silvia.
5,There's a need to be seen,"This is classed as Wire's pop album and to some certain extent it is their pop album. But it's an undeniably weird pop album. The lyrics don't make much sense and if you listen closely there is some weird instrumentation. On one of the tracks it sounds like one of the guitars is spinning out of control. But essentially it is a pop album. Yes there are synths here but like on The Ideal Copy they don't predominate the album too much. Again it seems like the only logical step forward that they could do. And it's worth it to listen to and it is an album that can be enjoyed over and over again....but you might agree, you might not. Either way you should try the album"
2,"For Wire completists, mostly","As a longtime Wire fan, ""A Bell is..."" is very disappointing (though not as awful as ""Manscape""). NO, I DO NOT expect them to ""do"" ""Chairs Missing"" over-and-over again and I think ""Ideal Copy"" is a BOSS ""comeback"" album (post-""154,"" that is). There are some pretty melodies on ""Bell..."" but for the most part the vibrant, thorny ""edge"" present on all their previous sets is mostly missing.If you're a die-hard collector of Wire, or if you like their late '80s progression towards sleek, New Order-like territory, OK -- otherwise, from this period. ""It's Beginning to and Back Again"" is similar but LOTS better."
4,Catchy....with a twist,"This disc is both accessible and catchy, well, at least for Wire. If you're used to average radio pop this will still be strange to you. But if you're looking for a good introduction to Wire, this is a great first buy. It shows their quirky side off nicely, but in the context of really fun, catchy songs. I like this band a lot, even though they do admittedly hit some doldrums now and then. This disc, however, is strong throughout and is a great introduction to the strange and wonderful world of Wire."
4,Enjoyable B Space Romp,"As many others have said, the movie has it's charm - it's fun to watch a couple of times. You'll also see several unique space ship designs - they show up in other B movies as well, although not together. I guess it's cheaper to recycle the models - and remember, this was the day of models - not CGI.Don't expect Star Wars or flashy special effects. Well, they are flashy - just not that good. It's a B movie, a cult movie, and was a staple on cable a couple of decades ago (it ran several times a day for months!)"
1,another star wars rip off,this movie stinks its one big epic star wars rip off this movie is boring lame stupid and totally unintelligent thanks for trying to rip off star wars you failed
4,"Zowie, the fun of Star Wars on a small budget","Great memories accompany this movie for me, thankfully the producers of this DVD have honored this production with a jam-packed feature full of special features. I was not even a teenager when this movie was released back in 1980 yet a group of friends and I made the pilgrimage to a local cinema to see it. With an interesting set of diverse characters the movie plays as a science fiction version of the Seven Samurai. A ""Magnificent Seven in Space"" as it were, it even features Robert Vaughn of that 60s gem. The real pleasure of the DVD however is the wealth of special features. We not only have one optional audio commentary, but two very informative pieces. There are preview trailers for other Corman productions such as ""Piranha"". We even get a trivia game. I certainly recommend this movie."
3,"I hate to disagree, but...","Actually, I don't disagree with most of the comments. The extras are great (especially the commentary, although Gale Anne Hurd has a tendency, at least in the beginning, to drop little nuggets of information without any context), and it's great to have this film in widescreen HOWEVER, whomever was raving about the transfer need to wipe the dust off of their TV! It's not that it's bad, it's too good. So good that you can see every scratch and fleck of dust on whatever lousy 21-year-old print they used to master this puppy. If they were going to put in the time to make this disc, at least they could have struck a new print for the transfer."
2,Saw this again for the first time in over 20 years.,"It had been, as stated, over 20 years since I had last seen this movie (of a tape copied from a TV airing) and I was someone exciting to receive it recently as a gift, eager to see how well I had remembered this film.The special effects were as I remembered them. Essentially, the same as the old Buck Rogers TV series. Space Cowboy, the ship Nell, and ""John Boy"" were as I remembered as well.What I did not remember, however, as the incredibly awkward ""sex"" talk between ""John Boy"" and his love interest (and her father earlier). That was just painful to watch. The implied rape of the Akiran woman (not at all graphical, but you know what happened) was unremembered as well. These aspects were disappointing, as I was hoping I was going to be able to share this with the kids. Too bad, because the rest was fairly enjoyable, if dated and low budgetted."
3,Fun knock off!,"Admittedly this is one of a slew of ""Star Wars"" knock-offs. So it is a historical piece. It is a nice B-Move, and one that you can give your kids who want to see the Matrix or Kill Bill."
4,I've been Waiting...,"...for this film to come back out in *any* video medium.And it's reissue in DVD was the major reason (aside from price) that we finally got a DVD player for ourselves this Christmas.This was the most expensive film Corman had made up until then, but i understand it paid off quite well for him -- partially because he built his own special effects unit (instead of conracting out to others) and then made his money back doing special effects for *other* low budget film makers.Sayles's script, Horner's score, Cameron's art direction -- all have been mentioned, and all are/were top-notch, lifting this film well above the level one might expect it to reach.I *almost* gave this five stars, but i have to agree with an earlier reviewer who mentioned the less-than-pristine print used for this disk; it's acceptable, but i could wish for better. Sound is good, though, and Horner's score is still as stirring as ever.(By the way -- is Dick Miller in here somewhere?)"
2,"Entertaining, but for reasons beyond quality.","This is one of those shows you loved as a kid, but to see nowadays makes you clutch your ribs with laughter at the absurdity of the whole thing. Well-known names such as George Peppard and Robert Vaughan shine brightly in their accustomed on-screen personas as they settle into their shoot-em-up-space-battle roles as... well... themselves.All in all, if you're into classic sci-fi movies, you will enjoy this film. If you're used to post-80's sci-fi, expect to fall into the MST3K mentality as you find yourself involuntarily throwing wisecracks at the screen. Either way, you'll probably have fun."
2,"oh well,","I finally got a copy of this . Not much of a story , TV quality special effects (cheap), but still fun to watch ! Great to see John Boy Walton, the Man from Uncle, the guy from the A -Team and (especially) Marta Kristen from Lost in Space (Judy Robinson) in a movie......grab some popcorn, push PLAY on the old VHS machine and enjoy !"
1,"Just Really, Really Bad",I guess I don't get it. The writing might be the only thing worse than the acting. It is painful to watch. This movie misses out at being laughably bad because you can tell they are actually trying to make something good. A total waste of $15. This review was written by someone who can laugh at movies like Santa Clause versus the Martians. No laughing at this piece of junk.
3,No CC: on Battle Beyond the Stars!,"This is a great, campy movie. Too bad no closed captioning or subtitling exists on it. They said that no new release including that is planned. Otherwise, the quality is fine, as was ordering and delivery."
3,I remember seeing this thing at Ronnies Drive-in in St. Louis...,"Friends,This was one of the only movies my mother and I ever saw at a drive-in in the middle of the school week. Why? I don't know. Maybe it wasn't playing anywhere else and she REALLY wanted to see it. The one thing I remember about the movie itself is that it seemed REALLY BAD!!! I was like 13 or 14 when it was released, so it must have been REALLY bad for me to have thought that. I can't wait to see it again though through more mature eyes 31 years later. For extras, they at LEAST need to do a spot about how Sybil Dannings costume wouldn't do for television and they had to roto-scope more clothing onto her!!! I'll be pre-ordering this along with DAMNATION ALLEY. Mid-July looks like fun!!! CKB"
4,Day-glo R2,"The same size and shape as the other R2-type droid figures that have been released in recent years. Its head is see-through and the detail in there is pretty cool. Its feet are articulated so it can be put in three-legged rolling mode and all three feet stay flat on the ground. Its third leg is retractable. Its eye doesn't light up but the head makes the requisite clicking/chirping noise when it's turned. It comes with some sort of ""electric-shock"" accessory which is, fortunately, removable. The paint job is decent and it appears to have some ""battle damage"". Not the most exciting figure of the four AOTC preview figs, but I have a soft spot for R2 (or in this case, R3) units so it will always have a place of honor on my desk."
3,Like To Listen To This,"When it comes to great R&B; songs these days, there just have been fewer performers that've really delivered from the heart. Corinne Bailey rae is one of those acts that have simply shown more essence in true soul with her debut record nicely. Her fourth single from the album, I'd Like To, really displays a more gritty kind of soul. Unfortunately, the song to me doesn't match the style she had shown well with her previous singles from the record like Put Your Record On did last year. All that I can hope for is her next single is much better than this one.Song: C+"
5,Been Looking for 5 Years,Like many others I first viewed this film on TV in the early 60's. I wish it were available on DVD. It is a powerful story with great actors and wonderful sets. A much overlooked work of Jimmy Stewart. I could not even find this at the Jimmy Steward Museum. It needs to be available.
1,Just poorly designed,This cradle has some issues. It really doesn't work all the time and there are connection issues with Macs (which palm has all but alienated). Plus the new click in click out system and small connectors take a beating everytime you move the handheld eventually they break (the beefier ones on the Palm VX were much better). Plus it's HUGE compared to some of the other cradles on the market. In general a marvel of poor engineering.Unfortunatly there is no alternatives to this cradle so palm can charge you 50 dollars for an Item that should be about 20.
3,Does not charge to 100%,"I'm not sure if the cradle I got was bad, but it does not charge my M505 to 100%. The USB cradle that came with the palm charges the M505 just fine. I plan on sending it back for an exchange.... We'll see what happens then."
2,"missing power supply, so basically worthless.","Good product, but did not come with power supply, so I must hunt for that now, will not work until I find a power supply somewhere."
3,DIFICIL DE USAR!!!!,"A diferencia de lo facil de colocar la Palm Vx en su base de transferencia de datos y carga de energia, esta Base para la serie Palm m500 es bastante dificil de colocar, ademas de lo dificil tambien de separar despues de su uso. Por que un sistema tan complicado para algo tan sencillo?Antonio."
1,Help Please,"Hi,Today is march 28 2002, at this moment i have not recieve the shipment. I call the Local Us Postal service and they cant tell me nothing about my package. Please help me with this matter.Thank You."
3,Not compatible with Tungsten E!,"I can't comment on the quality of the cradle but I have one comment. I ordered the cradle as it was listed as an accessory for the Tungsten E. However, it does not fit into the cradle and Palm doesn't seem to currently produce one compatible with it. Just want to warn others so you don't have the hassle of having to send it back."
4,"Slower, But Cheaper","I bought this cradle because I have to leave the USB cradle that came with my Palm M515 at the office. I chose a serial cradle for two reasons: all of my USB ports are filled at home and this cradle was significantly cheaper than a USB model.I find that the cradle is quite a bit slower. This would be a problem if I did as many Hotsync operations at home as I do at the office. Since I only sync at home to updat my AvantGo data and to re-charge my Palm,this cradle works fine.If you need a cradle for a situation similar to mine, don't waste your money on the more expensive USB model unless you're really impatient."
1,ESD Problem,there's a known problem with the USB cradles that they are extra sensitive to Electro Static Discharge. I fries both the cradle and sometimes the handheld (cooked my M515 yesterday for the second time). Look up Palm USB ESD on Google... Palm is going to replace my handheld again. The serial version of this cradle does not have this issue. If you ask Palm about getting a serial cradle back instead of USB they state you have to buy one.
1,Fussy- poor design,"The cradle is very finicky. The fit is not very tight and I have to press down on the top of the palm pilot to ensure the contacts are touching. Plus, it has it's own power plug AND the USB connection. I'd recommend the USB cable instead. It connects snugly, easily and is only one thing to plug in, plus very reliable long term. Charges fast too. This cradle just fell short all the way around."
2,At least the power works,"I agree with the other comments that the cradle is very tempermental with the M130. I have no problem setting my handheld in the USB cradle, but this one is much more difficult to get in properly.More importantly, I ordered this serial cradle specifically because the USB cradle will not work with Windows NT (a grievance in itself with Palm, who just never bothered to do the work). We never got this cradle to sync with Windows NT; it never recognized a connection to the computer. I couldn't get the cradle to be recognized on my Windows XP laptop at home, either. I sent an e-mail to Palm asking for advice or help with this problem, and two weeks later have heard nothing. I plan to return the item as it was completely useless for my purposes."
3,Bad fit for Palm m130,"It's a shame Palm did not make a special cradle for the Palm m125 and m130, since the Palm is not very stable in this cradle. Perhaps they will release a special cradle in the near future. In the mean time, you might want to invest in a cable."
1,cradle not compatible with tungsten !!!!,"The fact the cradle was listed as compatible, but was not was a great disapointment for me. I shop at amazon often and have had good results till now. Maybe it would be better to go a retail store to purchase these types items."
4,Good product. Better than my old prong style meter,This ph test kit works better than the prong style meter i used before (which was highly inaccurate and inconsistent). The pH test kit is accurate but also a little harder to judge exact pH levels but after a few uses it becomes so easy you dont have to look at the chart printed on the bottle.Im sure its not as great as a pH pen ($100+ easy) but for the price (4.50usd) you can't really beat it. My old prong meter cost more than that and was utter crap. this pH test kit is worth buying if you need accurate pH measurements without blowing $100.
4,Tried and True,"Being on a low budget, this works for me. GH has always provided quality products- so by default I'd choose this over other similar products"
5,So very practical AND inspirational!,"In all the categories teachers struggle with -- from giving grades to collaring class hoodlums -- Harmin gives practical, insightful suggestions. The focus is on strategies that work with today's students, who are more restless and resistant and often hard to get to do serious learning. All strategies have been tested and, I find, they work very well. Helped me become a much easier teacher, more satisfied and more effective. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
4,Facinating Story,"GBH is a facinating story of two rather damaged men locked in a political struggle that is larger than both of them. There are no special effects and no slick cimematography - just a good story told well. If you an Anglophile or have an interest in British politics of the late 1980's, this is a miniseries that you should own."
5,Great for client education!,"Professional designers, take heed! If you have a micromanaging client who wants to design over your shoulder, give them a copy of this book to read! At least their suggestions will become more aesthetically informed!I have often sent underbudgeted, DIY oriented clients away to their own devices with a loaner copy of this book. Solid basic design principles are outlined along with basic examples of how to apply them to common small-scale print design projects."
5,A definite for your desktop!!!,"I'm just one of the many folks who agree, this is an oustanding book!! As a beginning designer/desktop publisher, this book is a wonderful resource. I read it cover to cover and learned so much!! I really look at everything I see in print, with a much more knowledgeable eye. Designs that I've been using to build my portfolio are more ""amateurish"" than I realized and I'll be redesigning them with tips from Robin Williams. If you're designing ANYTHING to be printed, you need this book!!!"
5,Number one book in print for the first time designer.,"I purchased this book when I first started out in design. It was like a bible. Robin Williams is the single most experienced, yet flexible individual in design today. If you don't believe me read any of her books. (especially this one)"
2,"Definitely for ""non-designers""","As the book states, it's for ""non-designers"" -- like secretaries who have to write a newsletter for their boss. Williams certainly speaks to non-designers. To be fair, I already have a background in design -- part of which came from Design 101 when I was in college. I am an artist, and I am already aware of the basics, and much more.It's ""classic"" Williams: simple, yet effective samples, clean design, and clear and concise explanations. The gist of the book is the principles of design -- proximity, alignment, repetition and constrast. I knew that already, so this book didn't hold my attention.I really like Robin Williams' work, but this one was a disappointment for me. I certainly recommend it to a beginner, but for someone with experience, it was 5 minutes worth of reading...er, skimming."
2,Nothing new,"I didn't learn anything extra from this book. I totally got misled by the other reviews here. If your current profession involves some kind of design (creating reports, writing software to do it, etc.), chances are you won't really learn anything new from this book. Just read some of the reviews here and get the C-R-A-P concept, if you don't know it already."
5,Great for Educators!,I deserve a commission for all the copies of this book I have sold! I use this book as a text book in my classes for teachers on graphic design and doing desktop publishing with kids. I have several teachers in my school trained to teach kids the basics of graphic design - Robin Williams style! I have bought several copies myself because I keep lending it to people and I don't get it back. This has been one of the most useful texts I have come accross for classroom use!
4,"Very good for the ""non-designer""","If you care about the visual aspects of web pages, or even the reports and paperwork you produce at the office, this book is a good read.I have no official ""design"" training, but I do web design and photo work as a side business. It was good for me to see some things I've just done because they ""look right to me"" quantified as principles of good design.This book clearly labels itself as what it is, and delivers the concepts in a straightforward and ""non-snooty"" manner. I'll be very interested in pursuing more of this author's works. In my opinion, she deserves the praise she's earned for writing clear, understandable books with a great deal of information and no pretense."
5,Excellent Book for Designers and Non-Designers,"This is an excellent book for all types of design work including print and for the web. It's very easy to follow and you'll be able to apply the principles right away.You'll not find much theory but if you're looking for practical design concepts, look no further. Your projects will improve dramatically!!"
5,Primer on typography & design,"This is an excellent way to learn and understand basic design and typography principles. It is written for the newbie and all the concepts are presented in a clear, consise format. After reading the book, one should have a better understanding of design fundamentals and apply them to print and web projects. This book will also show you how to spot good design from bad -- all Robin Williams says are tried and true design concepts that have been around for ages -- in this day and age of ostentatious design, it's refreshing to go back to the old school."
5,Top of the List for Design Books,I have been developing user interfaces for 18 years from successful computer games to business applications.I read this book several years ago and it is now at the top of my list for anyone starting in UI design work. Its memorable Joshua Tree principle and C.R.A.P. acronym have stuck with me.Anyone doing anything visual on paper or screen should have this book in their library. Thank you Robin for a great contribution to the field!
5,Fantastic!,"I believe this book is so well written that it would be good reading, even for someone not interested in design. The author's light hearted approach makes it easy to absorb the material, and the material itself creates a strong foundation for design. My only wish would be for some color."
4,Good but lacks details,I'm glad I bought this book but I think it lacks in details. Visual examples are very useful but I would like more details on various graphics design principles. But it's excellent for novices.
4,Great introduction for the visually challenged,"As a technical person, this was one of my first stops to try and become visually aware - an important skill to have if one is in the web-publishing business. And even if the book does not cover web-publishing per se, you'll find a lot information relevant to designing web sites in these pages. It is also useful for the small business owner who has to look after their own design resources."
4,"good info, but i would have liked more!","as an aspiring web page designer (who always believed she had a ""good eye"" but often needs hours of trial and error to find that acceptable look), i was looking for a practical, beginners' introduction to graphic design. i am not interested in the theory or schools of thought or even terms so much as practical, usable info that i can put to work right away.i found this book to be straightforward, simple, quick to read, and very useful. the same day i got it, i was able to use the principles to improve the design of my web page immediately in significant ways! my only beef with the book is that it didn't take me far enough. i would have liked to get a lot more of the same! someone who has some background in graphic design would probably not get too much out of the book, but i would reccomend it to those without any formal training as a good starting point."
1,Ugly,"I may have too critical a background (been interested in typographic design for a few years), but one thing immediately struck me when I held this book in my hands: it's plain old ugly, sorry. The pages are full of obtrusive big and bold letters shouting all over the place (the chapter numbers measure no less than 5 cm), and the fancy font used for picture captions makes for decent eye-strain but not for much legibility. By reading this book, you may improve your wedding cards that you throw together using MS Office, but for a more comprehensive work on typography I'd rather recommend Bringhurst's ""The Elements of Typographic Style""."
1,For complete beginners,"I was also misled by the reviews. I am not a designer, and I was looking for something to help my design skills. However, this book was much too basic to teach me anything. I only got a little from the extensive section on type, most of which I knew about. I would like to see something with a little more depth. I know these principals, but would like something help me execute them better."
2,Poor in contents,"Extremely concise, well written, this books gives you only a narrow view of the page design processes and problematics, it lacks of an high level approach (bottom-down). I would expect more and more from that kind of book, only Black&White examples are reductive when approaching visual design arguments. This book would have been better catalogued in a ""Best Pratices"" series. The cost is appropriate."
5,"Easy to understand, quickly improved my layout skills",The book is very clear and provides simple guidelines for improving visual clarity and presentation. I went to design school and I never learned this stuff (hate to admit it). This book instantly helped me improve my layout skills. I highly recommend it.
4,"I prefer NHL 2002, but this has more action and graphics","NHL 2002 was my first game for Playstation 2, and I loved it. The new one has, of course, this year's rosters, but until I found the menu to speed it up, I was frustrated. IT CAN BE SPEEDED UP TO LAST YEAR'S SPEED- but again, it's a menu item. The grpahics are greatly improved, and yes, the announcer guy is still annoying, but the music has gotten annoying. I liked last year's more, and at the same time the music this year is kind of featured in a way so as to appear as a music video. Wierd, and lesser quality music. My nephew has never seen a hockey game, but all he wanted to do once he saw it was play, play, play- so if you want a good game, this could be the one, but go into your menu screen early!"
4,"A few problems, but all around a good game.","this game is a good one and worth the money, but just barely. the shooting is realistic, no more shots over 110 mph, and the golies make saves that actualy look like the ones the pros make. the music is cool,and the dekes are awesome. The graphics are very good in this game too. Some of the problems are that the golies are not good. You can sometimes let a backhand shot go from the blue line, and it will go in! unforgiveable. when you are playing, the crowd looks like colored paper, but that is not relivent. Also, there is no player or golie boost in season mode. Also unforgiveable. Don Taylor has dropped many of his dumb jokes, but some are still there. Otherwise, this game is one of the best. I recommend it to all hockey fans"
3,good game but..........,"This is a good game but I was disappointed that it didn't improve as much as I thought it would from last year, I was hoping that the franchise mode would change a bit but it didn't. The music got a lot better but over all the game play and features haven't changed enough to buy it if you already have NHL 2002."
3,It is great.,I think everything is good exept breakaway cam is distracting and gives you bad veiw. Play is a littel to sllow.
1,Not cool!,"Just gonna say I got NHL Starz 2003 from Serious. Although it's not the PC game, it was a bit more entertaining and in this economy a better value."
3,I played it for a while.....,...and one day when I went to play it and it wouldn't work!! If I was you (and from what I've found out Im not the only one with this problem) I would just wait until 2004 comes out or get 2003.
3,Well Done,"This book is not great, but it is an interesting study of the classes involved. The author is thorough in interviewing and draws interesting parallels between French and American working-class men. The problem is that the interviewees are just not very interesting. It feels put on at times and the men really do not have any new or revolutionary insight. Overall, this book could have been better if a wider and more diverse pool of men were interviewed and the author did more to bring the attitudes and character of these men to life in the book."
2,Tedious,"Like most of what passes as cultural sociology, this book is tedious and predictable. ""Boundary-work"" and so forth."
2,Harsh,"This album is harsh, no bones about it. You need to be an extreme Wire fan or a record collector to have any need for this album. As mentioned the 12XU is all cut up, I think Wire was having the [heart] out of all the louder, faster, harder wankers that can't digest anything less than a overplayed anthem - which I thought was brilliant. ""Eel Sang Lino"", ""Our Swimmer"" & ""Witness to the Fact"" seem to have had the makings of solid songs. Unfortunatly the recording & performance is too [messed] to save the cuts - it's too bad they never did those songs in the studio. The 'Heartbeat' cut is brilliant, but the studio version on Chairs Missing still wins out.Overall this album is a tosser, unless your a Wire nut pass it up."
4,Francoise Hardy - memories,"The selections were well made. I enjoyed it immensely. After all these years, it still sounds wonderful. She sounds great."
2,OUCH!,Had this book for my history class last semester. The author was my professor last semester and this semester as well. Although he is a great speaker and I enjoy his lectures. I lost him with this book. I try and read it again.
2,"Too many pictures, little content.","I subscibe to this magazine. Will not renew it either! Maybe I am too old to appreciate this periodical. It is way overpriced even with the Amazom, and others discount."
2,Magazine is great - Subscription service stinks!,"I subscribed in 2009 - got two issues, then nothing since the October/November issue....I inquired with customer service and got this reply:""We have extended your account for the December/January 2010 issue notreceived.We've experienced some significant production delays which have impactedour publishing schedule. The February, March and April issues will bemailed shortly.We apologize for the delays.""It seems almost pointless to subscribe... which is terrible because I love this magazine.."
1,I haven't receive any issue yet!,I haven't receive any issue yet! How should I I hope I can get a copy of it in the near future!
3,People + the New Yorker = Interview,"Interview is an interesting diversion. I prefer Interview over People or Us because the quality of the interview subjects selected really stands out over time. If you haven't read Interview, most articles are people in the arts interviewed by someone they already know or have something in common with. Consider it if you'd be interested by what would happen to People if it were to be run by the staff of the New Yorker from the 70's."
3,interview mag,got off to clumsy start with subscription having needed to change addresses but got this sorted out. the mag is what I expected but looking for ereader format going forward
1,Never Delivered!!!!!! Very Unreliable!,Subscribed to V Mag sometime last year.First off I waited almost 3 months before I received my first issue.Then...I never received another.TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!I love reading the articles and mostly gathering shoot ideas from the photos but I'm not gonna blow money away.They really need to get their act together before a bunch of subscribers wise up and threaten a class action lawsuit!
3,Not really edgy,"I got this magazine subscription free, so no complaints there about the price. That being said, I would never buy this magazine willingly. It tries to be edgy and provocative, but falls short in my opinion. Only edgy if you've lived a sheltered life.The only positive was the magazine format itself and the paper. Awesome gloss to it, and I did like how it was bigger than your average mag."
3,"warhola is dead, long live warhola","this magazine was more creative and necessary back in the day. bring back the large format, even if it was printed on non-glossy newsprint pages, the pictures were gorgeous & the interviews actually interesting.the best interviews now are by other celebrities, less promotion than flowing conversation between creative people.<<<the magazine is now more commercial and glossy, the photos aren't provocative.i will continue to be a fan, not a fanatic. where is the art? where is the style?"
2,Just go buy a Radiohead album,"There are some hooky tunes on this album. The Rick Rubin production is excellent. But the singer's delivery is so close to Thom Yorke's, you start to ask, ""Is this an homage or a forgery?"" These guys are talented, and they have credible influences, but the music's just not original. If you're looking for emotional, epic, radio friendly guitar rock, find yourself Radiohead's Pablo Honey or the Bends and get the real thing."
4,Finally! A good american band!,"I would really give this album four and a half stars. I really like everything about it. If you're wondering what it sounds like, its the voice of Thom Yorke in a way (lead singer of Radiohead) and the music of PJ Harvey, both exceptional artists. However, its just missing a little something to make it truly post rock. (art rock i suppose)i really love the way Paloalto comes across. since paloalto is one of SPIN magazines top artists, i bought the CD with a gift certificate and I now realize that it is a very good album. his voice is simply wonderful.finally, an american band has come through with an exceptional post rock album after hundreds of wonderful Eupropeans. Sigur Ros and Bjork from Iceland; Radiohead, Coldplay and U2 from the UK; Godspeed You Black Emperor from Canada and many more.throw away the gushy pop and hard rock cause here comes the wave of the future, in the city of the future, paloalto (also the band)"
4,Post Grunge Anthemic Rock & Roll,"Powered by clever hooks and rhythmic dynamics, the band triumphs with this very strong debut album. ""Sonny"" is the highlight track with a shimmering chorus destined for rock greatness. Producer Rick Rubin's touch is really noted here with his knack for big, defined tracking without losing the significance of the song. With mainstream music going slightly more rock these days, paloalto is a band that will surely (hopefully) become a household name soon."
3,"Not Bad, but Din Pedals was MUCH MUCH BETTER!!","Just a note for all those out there who like Palo Alto. You owe it to yourselves to check out the first band the vocalist fronted. They were the Din Pedals. You can get the band's only album used off this site for next to nothing, and I swear you will like it a great deal. I am not discouraging anyone from liking Paloalto. They are a decent band in their own right, but the Din Pedals album really shines as a little known gem that, in my opinion, beats Paloalto hands down."
4,Radiohead's greatest hits...,"This is what Radiohead would sound like if they were still good. Unfortunately for them, they suck now. Fortunately for Palo Alto there was a void left in the world of GOOD music and the shoes seem to fit for these guys. Sure it all sounds strikingly familiar, but who cares? The music is tight and the Thom Yorke vocal transplant has gone off without a hitch (poor Thom, no wonder he can't sing anymore). So anyway, it's a great album, particularly if you're reminiscing about the Pablo Honey/The Bends days.. You know, when Radiohead was good and making good rock music generally included the use of an electric guitar at some point. Ahhhh yes... Radiohead wishes they could still write songs like this."
3,Sounds like the Muse,I just listened to the depression sample.. and everyone says it sounds like Radiohead.. but if you know music well you will know of a band called The Muse.. if you havn't heard of them and you like paloalto go get the Muse. Other than that this cd sounds fairly decent.
3,Named after a B-Side...,"Yes these guys are fun, yes they share the same name as a Radiohead B-Side and yes, it is absolutely no surprise that they sound exactly like a Bends-era American version of Radiohead. Great if you dig that but rather unstimulating when taken out of context."
4,"""Better Days"" under a different name.","This is a repackaging of the Heptones 1978 album ""Better Days"", produced by Niney The Observer. In addition to the original album, it boasts 7 bonus ""version"" tracks. The cover of Elvis' SUSPICIOUS MINDS is fabulous; the cover of CRYSTAL BLUE PERSUASION less so but still interesting. Typically strong mid-70's reggae from one of the greatest vocal groups ever to hail from Jamaica. Ignore the silly cover art and enjoy a solid album of The Heptones."
3,"Looks nice, but lower than I thought.","The chair is nice.....I think the previous user describes it accurately....it does look great but the arm rests are low....you only realize it when you actually sit down in the chair. The back rest too doesn't reach up that high..I suppose it is pretty good for the price but I was just looking for something a little more cushier and engulfing (if that makes sense). Cant really sink into this chair but I think it will get softer and more comfy as I wear it in. I think it will also be a good chair to read in. Over all, it serves its purpose and looks nice even though its not EXACTLY what I wanted."
3,"Looks very nice, not the most comfortable","It looks very nice, simple to assemble,but the arm rests are very low and it's a little hard.I am still happy with that purchase, again it looks very nice."
4,Great chair but very light colored,"I am very happy with this chair and the matching ottoman. They arrived promptly, undamaged, and just as described in the ad. However, I was hoping for a color a bit more like beige than white and it is pretty much white. One of the views in the ad showed it as almost saddle-colored."
3,Assembly problem with chair back,"The back piece on one of the 2 chairs I purchased did not fit well, leaving a gap of about a half inch between the bottom of the back piece and the seat. This gap is very noticeable looking at the rear of the chair. The back of the other chair fit nicely. The problem looks to be that the two tenon posts on the ill-fitting back do not match the spacing and the depth of the mortise sockets in the chair bottom.As an aside, the seat cushions are very firm."
2,It wasn't a fluke,"I just wanted to point out that what the other reviewer said about the quality of the CD is true. The volume of the songs is incredibly low, which requires the listener to turn it up until the bass and treble drowns out all the subtler sounds.However, the songs themselves seem like nice, fun ambient music. The kind of stuff that would be great of a night of hanging out with friends. It's just too bad you can't hear it that well."
1,levels? what levels?,first off a caution - this is an inferior product.I don't know if I have a dud of this CD - but the volume of all the tracks are lower than anything else I have in my music collection.It's my fault for not listening to it first I guess - but that's how I've gotten into all the bent material - I trust their aesthetic - but other than the bent songs - I found nothing memorable or standout on this disk. Monotonous pimpish glam disco funk. Without soul. Maybe I just couldn't hear it.
4,another boozy one from the tiki tones,"Here's another boozy,loungy, beachy, spacey one from the Tiki Tones. Just like their classic, Suburban Savage, The Leisure Experiment provides a soundtrack to your life. It is the perefsct moodmaker for drinking or driving, or both. Of course I don't mean that. I know, it's short, an EP. but in this case, it's worth it. Buy it."
3,Not bad if you stumble across it for less than 10 bucks,"Does anyone remember the late 1990s retro-exotica boom besides me? I legally downloaded the Tiki Tones CD when I bought a CD burner back then and recently rediscovered these songs.This isn't bad music - it's similar in spirit to what Combustible Edison did much better. ""Green Bananas"" is the best thing here, featuring a sinister fuzz guitar riff, dialogue samples that seem to have been taken from an old B-movie, and some odd operatic tenor popping up unexpectedly. It's a great go-go/novelty song, the type of thing we might expect from Los Straitjackets.While the Tiki Tones might have been a real band, most of this CD sounds more like sessionmen who aren't exactly killing themselves to win us over. Maybe this was the point of the CD? I really don't know. It's a pleasant enough listen but if you like the genre, go for Combustible Edison, Stereolab, or the Sneaker Pimps."
5,Great product - no problems!!,The HP Power Adapter works well. The seller was right on and I would highly recommend purchasing any items from her. Thank you.
5,NEPHEW LOVES IT,my nephew is the recipient of all star wars puchases - he gives them a big thumbs up! if he's happy - we're happy!
3,soothing,"I have a very mixed reaction to this book. There are some very lovely rooms and objects, but for the most part there is nothing out of the ordinary here (with the exception of marvelous ironwork fence bits). Some interiors could be swapped out from one house to another without jarring the eye. Too much designer influence and not enough passion and eccentricity."
5,Review from Behind,"I was very fortunate to be Rich's Drummer in his other band Bloom, VERY talented band. Have played in 100's of bands in my time, never had the joy of playing such powerful song's as Rich's. Also I am on the first cut of Fuzzy Doodah, Moonlight Mary. To this day I still listen to Bloom & Fuzzy Doodah more than any other band, Period. I am a true FAN.Donny Marvin"
5,Most Amazing Music!,This CD helped me to realize that music could still stir deep emotions within my soul... Thanks Rich
3,archeology and terrorists,"Paul Sussman really knows what he is writing about and is able to bring it in an interesting manner. The main theme, the search for the lost army of Cambyses, is combined with the terrorist threat that is present in today's Egypt. This is a great book with a lot of action and humour, but the plot is a disaster. How would anyone be able to believe that the main character, inspector Khalifa, is able to succesfully defeat a whole group of terrorists, in the middle of the desert by himself? It sounds like the plot of a Hollywood movie. A happy ending is fine by me, but it has to be a bit believable. Nontheless, this didn't ruin the book for me. Sussman is able to bring his story in a convincing manner, and although I didn't like the plot, I still recommend it."
5,Excellent thriller,"This book is very well written and does an excellent job of intertwining an archaeological mystery with modern terrorists. It has a particularly nasty villain. It also brings an unusual setting -- modern day Egypt -- to life, with interesting, believable characters. I found it very engrossing and recommend it highly."
1,I really tried to like this but...,"I really tried to like this but couldn't make it past page 53. I like ancient Egypt and the concept of mingling a modern mystery with an ancient mystery is intriguing but the author just couldn't do the subject matter justice. He's not a bad writer but he's a lousy storyteller, if you understand the difference. His pacing is off. He has no feel for drama. There are no dramatic moments in the first 53 pages despite a couple of deaths. I didn't care what happened to any of these people because there's nothing interesting or likable about them. Caricatures do not make memorable characters. At no point does he make you feel like you're in Egypt even though his descriptive passages are arguably accurate. Nothing is surprising. He goes into long descriptive passages that add nothing to the story and slow the pace. Essentially he writes like a nonfiction writer trying to write fiction for the first time, which is what he's doing."
1,"Nice try, but not nice enough","This book had the makings of an excellent story: great subject, intriguing plot-line, and exotic locations. Unfortunately, Sussman is not able to put them together successfully and the result is a hack-job of a book. The ending is utterly ridiculous and resembles that which you see from a first year cinema screenplay writer.Save your money and your time. Buy something else. Almost anything will do."
2,dont waste your money and time,"The only reason I gave the book 2 stars is because the author knows something about the archaeology of ancient Egypt, and because he uses the mistry of Cambyses's Army to base the plot on.The book has an unbelievable plot like a third rate movie. The characters are shallowly and two-dimensionally delineated-absolutly no deapth of character. The plot is standard holywood type (as if the writer was actually using a novice writer manual for cheap thrillers).In short- no meat!Save your valuable time and money for better stuff !"
1,Beyond Awful,"I'll make this short. I agree wholeheartedly with the 1 and 2 star reviews listed here. Had great hopes for this book from the liner notes but the story and characters were laughable. But what was truly jaw-dropping was the writing - so awful as to be almost a joke. Beyond painful to read. How did this book get past any editor worth his salt. Does this writer have no pride or simply no talent at all. I've seen cartoons that had better writing and characterizations. Both the author and Grove Press should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this abysmal charade on the public, not to mention the poor trees that died to produce it. Please, if you are thinking about reading this book, even as a beach read, think twice - this is the publishing equivalent of a lobotomy or a drunk one night stand. You won't respect yourself in the morning."
4,The Lost Army of Cambyses,Good story - well researched. Seemed in a hurry to finish. Maybe he had a limit on how many pages could be included. Fun Read!!!!
4,Strong story telling,The author does a great job or intertwining the various characters and subplots in to a very exciting novel with compelling characters.
5,For fans of James Rollins,"This is a fast moving tale that fans of Rollins will love. I borrowed it from the library and now I am adding it to my personal collection. Fascinating insights from archeology and interesting characters. The twist near the end came out of nowhere and added a final dimension that left me exhausted but satisfied. I highly recommend it and at the price offered by Amazon it should be a no-brainer for any action novel fan. Attention Hollywood, this would make a tremendous movie if done right. Highly recommended."
3,Werid story line,This is an episode that was written in a hurry and it was easy to tell. You need this episode for the future or you can skip it.
2,dr.who watcher,"this is the only dr. who movie I did not like,the second dr. who did great shows this is the only bad one"
5,The best Troughton story ever.,"It has to be said. This is the best Troughton story from his three year stint as the Doctor. The five episodes( each only twenty minutes for some reason) has content, humour, and loads of atmosphere. I do not want to go into the story, as it would spoil some entertaining surprises, but wait till you see the Doctor put his wits up against the mind robber, a war between two very intelligent people. As usual you will see the satire that comes from the mouth and facial features of Pat Troughton. I have seen every Troughton episode that is still in the archives of the BBC and these five episodes will be the best you see. The giant clock toy soldiers provide the scary atmosphere in this one. GET IT NOW. Oh, by the way, the story which immediately follows this (the Invasion) features the Cybermen in their last episodes until the Tom Baker era, and has all the excellent qualities you would expect from a Troughton story, the second best Troughton story, check it out"
4,Creepy,Story 45 consists of episode 6.6-6.10. Would definitely not want to visit this planet...You feel bad for the... villain..at the end though...
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!,It sucks. I tried to order the seeds and it didnt even get to my house. I was so beyond pissed!!!!!
4,Steven Wray Lobdell - 'Automatic Writing By The Moon' (Holy Mountain),"Current guitarist for long-running German krautrock / progressive band, Faust. This is Lobdell's first solo effort and it's about what I had expected. Basically, good neo-psychedelic folk, with sort of a Faust-like vibe to it. Recommended cuts include ""Lids Of Pot"", the beautifully-played ""Astride The Waning Moon"", the wonderful ""Automatic Writing By The Moon #2"" and ""Pluto Retrograde"". A good pick."
3,Xtreme Problems,"The only complaint I have about this game is that it doesn't work on some computers, like Gateway laptops. It never loads. It just never loads. I waited half an hour and it just froze. But the gameplay is pretty fun and easy (Except that if you push jump to many times, StickyKeys comes up. I'd advise you to change the key to N) and the graphics are ok. If you like racing, it's an okay game."
3,ISLAND XTREME STUNTS,"This game is the best Lego game ever. However, it requires an outrageous video card. It crashed several times on my computer. If you have a Dell, it won't load motorbike mayhem, one of the five sub-games. Otherwise, it's outrageously fun! You can explore the island and get your licenses, ride your skateboard, talk to people, or maybe smash pizza in people's faces! This game is cool!"
4,"really cool game, works great!","this game was awesome!! the different sub-games are exciting and exploring the island was cool. the only problem was that it's not possible to delete games that are maessed up. otherwise, this game rocks!"
1,L-L-L-L-eego....!!,"If there was a 0 star rating ... this would get it.Yes... L-L-L-Lego was stuttered over and over... and over again in the first version of this horrid series of PC games. After years of hating the first dismal wreck of a game... we felt like we'd take a chance on the series again.Well, guess what. It crashes and burns just like the earlier games in the series. Stay away. FAR away!!"
2,Poor execution by a skilled lawyer,"One would think that a former commissioner of baseball and skilled attorney would be able to product a fascinating set of reminesces that served to educate the reader about baseball during the Depression. Sadly, that's not the case.It's unclear whether Vincent had any interaction with the players. These unfocused streams of consciosness don't really show any thought regarding what types of information was being sought. It's as if someone sent a tape and said ""talk about what you remember from playing baseball for three hours and return"" and then pretty much typed what they said verbatim.In short, I was very disappointed. There's a great book to be written on baseball during the Great Depression, but this isn't it."
3,"Not the ""the glory of their times"".","Interesting players in an interesting era, but not very tightly edited."
4,WELL WORTH IT,"THIS IS ABOUT HOW BASEBALL WAS PLAYED DURING THE 1930'3 AND 40'S ACCORDING TO 10 OF THE TOP PLAYERS IN THAT ERA. SOME OF THE PLAYERS INTERVIEWED ARE BOB FELLER, WARREN SPAHN, RALPH KINER AND BUCK O'NEIL. THE AUTHOR DOES A GOOD JOB AND MAKES THESE INTERVIEWS BOTH ENTERTAINING AND INTERESTING. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS AND SUGGEST THIS FOR FANS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH OR WHO ARE INTERESTED DURING AN ERA WHEN BASEBALL WAS A GAME AND NOT A BUSINESS. WHEN PLAYERS PLAYED FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME SOMETHING TODAYS GREEDY AND SELF CENTERED PLAYERS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT."
2,"Rambling, sloppy, incoherent","Despite the title, several of the players interviewed for this book starred in the 1950s. Many of the verbatim interviews are nothing more than rambling, incoherent reminiscences of aged players whose memories are exaggerated at best. Ralph Kiner's interview, in particular, is almost undecipherable, much like his broadcasts were."
5,"Bolero-flavored disc full of romance, charm","""Mi Corazon es Tuyo"" is a treat from beginning to end. The quality of Beltran's voice is impeccable on this disc, and the music is enchanting. The album is most notable for three bolero-flavored ballads: ""Paloma Triste"" is an emotive song that has proved to wear well with time (this CD came out four years ago, and the song still receives considerable airplay). ""El Amor de mi Vida"" and ""Este Diciembre"" are the other gems on this production. The tenderness of Beltran's voice works well with fast-paced cumbias as well, as demonstrated on the title track and ""Ya No."" This album reflects a period in which Beltran's sound was quickly maturing, as was her image. As evidenced by the album cover, no one knows how to make the the banda look quite as elegant as Beltran."
1,If she makes an album in a different language,"It will be as bad as the ones in spanish. I think no one in their right mind would buy them. Her albums are poorly sold. They are bad enough in spanish, can you imagine in english? I bet she will be a tough competition to Celine Dion. HA!HA!HA!NOT!!!"
3,A Bumpy Ride Through Marxist Territory,"""Go West"" (1940) is easily the best of the Marxes' final three MGM releases. Unlike ""At the Circus"" and ""The Big Store,"" the brothers were able to test some of their material in front of live audiences. This is evident during the classic opening sequence in which Harpo and Chico fleece Groucho - rather than the other way around. ""Go West"" also features one of the Marxes' most memorable climaxes as they tear down a running train in order to fuel it. Otherwise, the film is a hit-or-miss affair, with some terrific Harpo routines and a few regrettable scenes in which Groucho's stature is painfully diminished. It's a pity that the screenwriters did not have a better understanding of the Marxes' comedic personas."
3,"Some funny moments, but not enough.","The Marx Brother's ""Go West"" does have some hilarious moments, but unfortunately there's not enough. It starts out great but goes downhill, occasionally having some very funny moments throughout. ""Go West"" is pretty weak about half the time, but it's worth seeing just for those moments of gold."
3,Late Marx Brothers better than exppected,"As a long time Marx fan,, I avoided many later films on their negative critical reputation. Seeing this now was a happy surprise, with many delightful moments. No it's not Duck Soup, but it is so nice to be in their company again!"
5,best,"Comprehensive, good support, further online classes available. None of the others I tried had any of these characteristics."
5,"Doesn't stop the loneliness, but ends the pain of hunger.","Eating frozen pizzas, rice and mac & cheese gets old after a few years. After finishing another week of the same old stuff, I just couldn't take it anymore! It became that I'd rather be hungry than have to choke down another cheese covered noodle.That's what lead to me finding this book. What a life changer! I can't believe all the varieties of foods I've been making! Almost every night I can heat up a new meal, and even some of the most complex foods don't even take an hour! It's completely changed my eating habits! Now if only if I had someone to eat with. As happy as I am to pull those meals out of the microwave a quick and painful rush of sadness always washes over me as I sit my plate down in my dimly lit dinning/living room area of my apartment.If you're teetering on the edge of buying this or passing it up, I say the choice is easy! It's really cheap too! Go ahead and add it to your cart, it'll change your perspective on the appliance!"
4,good book,i first got this at the library. it's a good book & they have a great website that has a converter thing that lets you convert the old 700watt cooking times to the watts of modern microwaves! it also has links on where to get little cookware.
1,Depressing as hell!,"Only purchase and read this book if you are a sad, lonely, and depressed person or want to become one. I can think of no other book in the history of the English language that can so quickly melt the spirits of even the most jovial care-free soul. This book is nothing but a downer. Just look at the cover. Doesn't it make you want to weep or perhaps it makes you feel a bit cold and sad inside? Sad, sad, sad. Oh the humanity!"
1,Very outdated.....,"Potential buyers should note that the original copyright date for this cookbook is 1986 - 23 years ago! At this time microwave ovens were very basic and lacked the features found in modern units. Also, there were very few products on grocery shelves designed for microwave ovens. This cookbook is very outdated and I hope others won't be taken in (as I was..) by its title alone."
4,Good book,"Haven't done any recipes as it is for my older, single father, but it looks like it will be good for him!"
3,It was okay...,"The 8th Doctor comes into a future London when the Daleks have been beaten off, and they have left a legacy of weapons. This London is run like a feudal society, with two ""kingdoms"" in power. (One of these kingdoms is run by a leader with the last name ""London"" which got confusing at various points). Moreover, a certain well-known villain (aside from the Daleks) show up to throw a wrench in the proceedings.Susan, the Doctor's granddaughter, is present, and still looking like a youthful teen even though her husband David is aging; he is in his 50s. The Doctor meets David; but, due to separation, the Doctor never meets Susan. And, the anti-climatic ending has the Doctor looking for Susan as well as another companion who was lost in the course of previous novels.I would have preferred a book that has an ending that stands on its own, and certain points are slow (as well as confusing, with the aforementioned ""London"" usage) but overall the book is enjoyable."
2,Worked well for three months and after it broke,"Not well made, The metal head broke from glass body. I have not dropped it. It worked well for three months but then I went to shave and the metal head fell off. It can not be re-attached. I would not recommend anyone buy this product."
4,Great punk band,Sounds like old school NOFX when they were punker. The singer even sounds like fat mike. Every song is a worthy listen. Pick it up. You'll be surprised. It's a pleasant reminder of how good pop punk can be.
2,wrong movie,"There is more than one movie named Shattered. I made sure what I was ordering. And it was not the one you see in the photo here , Shattered was from the early 90's, I got a hold of the sender. They said they knew that movie was not avaliable , so they sent a different one .Guess I cant trust ordering from Amazon anymore !"
4,WHO AM I?,"SHATTERED is Wolfgang Petersen doing Brian DePalma doing Alfred Hitchcock and as a mystery/thriller, it has some intriguing moments. Tom Berenger stars as David Merrick, a wealthy businessman who is in a horrible car crash, needs plastic surgery and has amnesia to boot. Greta Scacchi is his devoted wife who tries to nurse him back to health and help him remember his past. Bob Hoskins shines as a pet store owner/private investigator who also tries to piece the puzzle together. All is not as it seems though; is Scacchi trying to kill her husband? Is she having an affair with a handsome stranger? Is Corbin Bernsen wearing a toupee?The movie keeps your interest and although the twist at the end is fairly obvious, it does keep you guessing."
2,Has good twists and turns but the acting is bad,"A typically early 90's thriller like Basic Instinct, Fatel Attractiona nd Indecient Praposel. This film works in soem levels and then falls in more levels. The good parts in the film is the twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The bad stuff is the terriable acting from everyone in the film. It's not entirelly bad and worth to see for the twist and turns but that's it."
3,Let us see why...well just why.,"Before I get started this game is OK, just OK. The game starts off where you play as some guy who comes to this island for...I don't know or care. So you talk to dumb friends who talk about nothing all day. Then you fall asleep and you wake up and your friends are gone, and now the game gets started. The game's graphics are bad. The monsters look bad as well but that is not the worst part. The back grounds are God awful. It looks like a guy threw up on the game. The controlls are on and off. Some times the game is fun if you play it long enough. If you like B-Movie games you will like this game. I give this game a 3 outa 5. I recommend that you should just rent this game."
4,Simple and effective,"Very simple, effective solution for backup of your palm. I have ran out of batteries a few times and restoring all palm files and data is pretty straightforward.I just wished it would had more memory to save pictures as well.Definitively a great buy!"
3,slippery slot,"I found that the version of Photoshop that comes with the m505 works from the card, and a lot of downloaded games and programs also work on the card, such as PacMan, Acid Solitaire, etc. Most disconcerting to me is the faulty locking mechanism on my m505. I need to tape the cards to the m505 to keep the card in the slot. I don't know if others have this problem too.Art"
3,Would like to give it more than 3 stars,"I would like to give Palm 5 stars for this product but in spite of it works excelent, I have to say that in the event that one card stops working 3 weeks after bought, Palm as a serious company confident of the quality of its product should have a minimun Warranty for this kind of accesories. Not the case. I decided to bought it after having Palms since the 3com pro model and noticed how important is to count with your data in the event of a Palm accident. Unfortunately, what should be a bullet prof device fails first than the device it was suposed to protect."
2,It does what it says... and thats it.,"I just bought the Palm m505 and this memory card. I assumed that it would triple my memory without a problem. I was half right. It tripled my memory, but only for applications that do not access other files. In other words, your Palm (and I assume any other device using this card) will not be able to access document files put on the card. Nor will readers on the card be able to access the normal memory. I use about 85% of the normal 8 megas on the palm and most of that is for documents and books. This card is useless for that. Right now I have installed everything that I can get to run on the card and its less then 1 MB. I have memory, but nothing that goes on it is very big and the big files wont work on it.I gave it 2 stars because it did do what it said. If I find a way around this dilemna I will love what it can do. Bottom line, it promises more then it delivers."
3,Its slow and any other SD card sworks too and is probably ch,"I got my card a while ago when nobody could answer if cards from other vendors work too. You get as an example the panasonic 64megs for 120 bucks which I would prefer now. Sometimes it says it enhances your memory but its not the same as internal memory. Applications start slower from the card, if at all (some like vindigo do not work of the card since they need more then one file to execute properly). Also the overall handling is uncomfortable. You need to get tools like Filez, MS Mount and McFile to make working with the card more userfriendly.The concept is definitly not yet ready for primetime. My brotehr uses an MMC card and he says he gets the same speed when it comes to launching applications."
2,Good but too expensive,"Eventhough it's good and fast due to SD card bandwidth interface, compared to MMC and Sony memory stick. Palm 16 MB SD card is too expensive. The price of [money], you can buy at least 32 MB or even 64 MB of Sandisk SD card from some stores. Moreover, 16 MB is not enough anymore when most of the professional palm programs are among 4-5 MB."
5,Monica did the damn thang,I think that the song which stands out the most is Monica's Uh Oh.She snapped out. Thats why everyone should by this.
5,South West DeKalb High School Alumni,"This movie and soundtrack is the best. Not just from a viewer perspective but as a moral stand point the movie is good I recommend it to all College Choir Members and College and High School Band Members, the moral point of the story is very obvious but they put it in the movie subliminally.I give this movie all the props that it is due. and I am not just saying this because SouthWest DeKalb High Schol Marching Panther Band was in the movie.THIS MOVIE IS REALLY OFF THE HOOK"
3,Just a'ight,"It is one of those cd's that you feel for a minute,forget about,and pick it up a year later and say ""Oh Yeah..."""
4,Good but....,"I don't listen to R&B/Hip Hop music much but I am in love with the Drumline music. There is so much skill presented in it that I can't deny its appeal. Sadly, I was expecting more of the drumline music but only got roughly 10 minutes worth. The rest of the CD is alright. I don't hate the music but it's not my 2nd choice of stuff to listen to. That being said, I still gave the soundtrack 4/5 since the drumline music was exceptional."
3,JC single is worth buying the CD but others get you groovin,"I bought this CD to hear JC(from Nsync) first solo song. . I have always been an Nsync fan primarily for JC but this shows his talent and is much more raw then Nsync. I love Blowin' me up (JCs track)so much. At first I would just listen to that song but when I gave the rest of the CD a chance I found many other great tunes. The soundtrack also has great songs from Too-short, Nick Cannon, and Nivea. Overall a good CD to get you in the mood to dance!!"
2,Poorly performed Percussion tracks,"If you're looking to get this CD and listen to the 3 percussion tracks, look elsewhere. The drumline that performed the tracks seems very poor, lacking percision and timing in all of the scores.Just listen to the snares, they should sound as only one person is playing, yet there are anywhere from 8-10 seperate snares. In all the tracks, the line gets muddy and out of sync with eachother."
3,Big Joe's Swan Song,"Big Joe Turner was one of the fathers of Rock n' Roll. This CD captures him at the age of 72, about 2 years before his death. If you're not familar with his work, I'd recommend one of the CD compilations of his 1950s material instead. However If you're already a fan, this CD has its own charm.Even at an advanced age and in declining health, Big Joe was a potent singer. His re-working of these familiar songs has a raucous and ribald swaggering feel like it was recorded in a juke joint instead of a studio. And talk about a band - the guys playing on this CD are jammin! This is real big band R&B; and blues, played with authority. It's not his best work by far. But it's pretty darn good for an old man. Best songs: ""Call The Plumber"", ""Down Home Blues"", ""Big Leg Women."""
3,Overpriced but still not bad,"Compared with the flimsy flip-face that comes with the m500 systems, this is beautiful, but overkill.The zippered leather case is well-padded and protects the m500/505 well. With a little creative positioning you can still get the m500/505 into its cradle without having to remove it from the case's compartment (a real time-saver). However, the multiple pockets for the expansion cards are somewhat useless (how many m500-series owners do you know with SD cards coming out their ears? I'm a geek and I only own the one I bought with the system!), and as a wallet there's not enough pockets here to move stuff over from your pocketbook.This is a nice case, but it's not perfect either. Get rid of the pockets, and keep the padding, and drop the price. Still, if you want to protect your investment in your m500/5 Palm, don't trust that flimsy flip face: *this* is a much better idea."
1,Horrible Case!,"I bought this case to fit my palm m515. Firstly, the palm is secured to the case via a pole to slip in on the left of the case. Not at all secure. My palm actually fell out of the case. Thank goodness it fell on my bed. Also, the front cover has two leather strips (the purpose of which i have no idea) that are exactly in line with the front buttons, and every time i put the palm in my pocket, the case presses the leather strips onto the buttons and turns on the palm. The case really does not offer any form of protection for the palm. Only if it falls flat on it's back or front that it may offer some protection. But if it falls on its right side, top or bottom, you're in trouble. The plam is exactly aligned with the case, and at some places actually protrodues by a couple of millimeters. I sent the case back."
1,Not secure.,"This product seems nice at first, but within a few hours one will discover that the Palm will not stay in the case. The bar that slides into the stylus slot is too small, and the device slips out in a purse or pocket. The little tabs meant to protect the buttons on the bottom then presses these buttons, turning on the Palm and wasting the battery. Not at all satisfactory."
4,"nice, stylish","Fine product, tight fit for your palm but makes it a bit oversized (it kills the idea behind tiny pda). It's a great product for storage/transport not quick access. I think that I will try the all around aluminium case for actuall work. Closure is kind of flimsy and case opens up but since your palm is tightly jammed it wont fall out. Nethherless it's still a problem."
1,Impractical,"This just didn't work out for me. First, the on/off button kept getting hit while in my travel bag, leaving me with no Palm on one trip and virtually no power left on another. On top of that, blank notes kept being left due to this issue. The leather flap is constantly in the way when you try and enter something. I gave up and bought the hard case as a replacement. It's smaller and much sturdier so shouldn't have any of the above problems. Plus it opens up all the way for easy use."
1,Smaller than it looks!,I was very disappointed in the case. It is small and the pockets are too small. Business cards fit in the clear pocket but try and get them out! Not very functional. The palm fits in akwardly and syncking it in in the case (it is too hard to take it out) is tough.
3,It's OK,"While this is superior to the little leather flap that comes standard with the Palm, I find it annoying that even when this case is on, the Palm turns itself on while in my bag, doing God knows what while the battery is running down. It's easy to get the palm in and out of it though, which is nice for hooking to my laptop. Haven't used a similar product, so I don't really have anything to compare it to."
3,Could use more slots for personal cards.,"I couldn't find anything better so I decided to get this case. At first, I thought the palm would slide out easily like the other reviews.. and I think its because they didn't push hard enough to snap the palm on the built in post. IT DOES LOCK JUST LIKE YOUR STYLUS! You don't need velcro. It took me 2 days to finally get it to lock on.. heh. Its nice, a little bit bigger than my wallet I had before, but for a I hope I""ll get used to it.. or i'll have to go back to wearing a purse (which I hate.. yes i'm female) But stuffing 6 cards in when its only built for 2 will do that. =)"
4,Best hands-free way to carry around the Palm m50X,"There are a lot of people at work with PDAs, and they all carry them around in some kind of portfolio-style case. This was not acceptable to me--I wanted a hands-free way of keeping my Palm m505 with me.This case is the answer. The black leather is stylish and durable. And this case is low profile--I bought the m505 partly because it's so small, and I wanted a case that's small too. The Palm fits real snugly into this case, and the case is narrow so that you're not always banging it into things as you walk around.The only complaint that kept me from giving it five stars are that I wish Palm built some compartments into the flap cover of the case for carrying extra memory cards. But that's being nit-picky.This is the best way I've seen of keeping your Palm at your side without having to carry it around with your hands."
4,Excellent wallet case for the m505,"I got my wallet the day I got back from a long trip...and planed to return it...for a refund, but then I looked at it. This wallet is perfect for the m505 and has allowed me to reduce the amount of stuff that I put into my pockets every day. The Palm slides onto the rail for a secure fit. The other flap in the wallet holds my drivers license, credit cards, cash and cards for the m505 all very nicely. The walet also fits nicely into the pocket of all my shorts and pants. It feels well crafted and the leather is very nice.Overall, I am glad I bout it..."
1,Need picture of the back of this item.,"It would be nice, since this item is billed as somewhat different from the others, to have a picture of the clip on the back so I could know what I'm getting before I buy it."
2,Doesn't work as a wallet,"It doesn't have enough room for credit cards and documents (i.e. id, license, etc.), the space is very limited, so at the end you have to use it only to carry your Palm, you can not put it in your back pocket because is too big (and you don't want to seat over it neither) and its more like one of those small purse for women than a men's wallet - I would definitely remove the zipper (most men's wallets don't have a place for coins). The strap is not easy to use at all, it's complicated to open and close. Color and quality are very fine, but they are irrelevant if you can't use it."
2,Design Flaw,"The Leather Palm case has a design flaw that does not allow you to place another stylus in the case securely. The note pad is un-necessary and cumbersome. The case does not allow you to use the Palm's own cover to attach the Palm to the inside of the case, since the case has a rediculous built in attachment for connecting the palm to the interior. The palm is included with it's own cover that is supposed to be used for securring it to the case, which cannot be used with this case. You then have an extra part that ends up left in your desk. Illogical!"
2,Poor quality,"The pictures online and on the box show a metal zipper; it is not. Worse than that, the zipper passes so close to the Palm inside that the edges may get scratched over time. The stiching does not look very durable either."
4,A very thorough view on sevice excellency,"This is one of the first books that discuss the client-side of businesses. When this book was published, very few authors had thought of addressing this topic, and Heskett, Sasser and Hart did an excellent job in their analysis of the service industries. The market for banks, hotels, airlines and other service providers has changed dramatically in the last ten years, and the authors show what the leaders in each of these markets did to keep their customers coming back. They show that the main goal of the corporation is to 'achieve goals for the customers', not only perform services day in and day out. I have read many other books on this same subject after this one, but none with such wit and brilliance."
2,NOT a 2008 book,"I bought this book thinking it was a current reference, based on the Amazon publishing date of 2008. It must be the date of re-issue, because the real copyright date is 1990!! So, although the principles may still be sound, the examples are over 20 years old -- not useful to me at all."
3,VERY PREDICTABLE,"As a child, Vance (Phil Haus) was taught, or perhaps badgered by his father on how to play basketball. His mom moves them from Wisconsin to NYC where he attends an intercity school as ""the new white boy."" Jules (Jason Hurt) recruits Vance to be his basketball partner in a street 2 on 2 basketball game with very limited penalty rules. Vance develops a love interest in Lena (new comer Noelle Mihalinec) when he is not practicing basketball during an electronic hip-hop music montage. Maurice (Antoine Harris) is Lena's ex bf (he doesn't take it too well) and is also Vance's arch rival on the basketball court. The big duel basketball tournament is coming up with a $50,000 prize. Have the plot figured out yet?No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Movie is designed for young teens or tweens. Older adults might be bored with it."
5,Nice Film,I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Better than your average low budget movie and more thoughtful than most teen or sport movies.
5,"If God existed, it would be necessary to abolish him.","Bakunin was a true activist. Spending little time writing, Mikhail Bakunin was a full time revolutionary and heavy critic of the existing movements of the time. In his only published work, God & the State, Bakunin lays out his arguments against ""Gods and Masters"" with great accuracy. He is truly a man to be admired (he once was a wealthy aristocrat but rejected this life for one of constant struggle.Worth Reading, even if you don't agree with him."
1,Poor quality publisher - find a different version!,"If you want to read this book, I'd suggest finding a different publisher/version. The publisher clearly makes really poor quality books - and doesn't proof. I saw about one typo per page - pretty pathetic. For a book priced so high, the quality should be MUCH better - a rip-off."
3,Anarchy in Russia,This book offers a glimpse into the mind of a great 19th century anarchists. The book is fascinating in its argument against both god and the state. It is at times unreadable and borish which could be owed to the difficulty in translating from Russian to English. It didnt sell me on anarchism anymore than 200 Grateful Dead shows could but it is a compelling read for any thinker wanting to have their ideas challenged.
1,Waste of $$$,There are so many other great books on the Hamptons out there. I wouldn't waste your $$ on this one....
4,so much repeat,"I am big Clannad fan. Have everything they have done from the start. This concert is not much different than other concert versions they have out, and just more repeat of repeats. Some albums I now have 5 and 6 copies of the same song. Very good, but not worth the money if you have all their other stuff. Songs are not my favorites either."
4,He is the master after all.,"This book really does not have a lot of content or instruction. If you really want to learn more about pool you'll find more in other books by less prominent pool players (ie, Robert Byrne, Phil Capelle), but he does make some very good points about the fundamentals. However, above all other things, Willie Mosconi is the greatest pool player to have ever lived and any serious pool player should read his book out of respect if nothing else."
3,"Good book for beginner, not much info for moderat to expert",The book is well written and easy to read. The instruction is well presented so the novice can uderstand and with practice will be able to advance in the game. For the intermediate on up player this book has little to offer except to learn a little about Willie which could be better spent reading a book that is devoted to Willie and not a sideline intro. depending on your skill level it is either good and well worth your time or is not worth reading. Even though i did not gain much useful information i still enjoyed the book.
5,Good,"Very good..product was good and it was on time.Looking for this item for a long time, very happy! Bye"
2,opinion does not reflect the seller,"when we reviewed this video, we had forgotten how much rated ""R"" material was in it. Foul language was a turn off. this product arrived as promised with out a hitch."
5,ride on!!!!!!!,"simply put when i was 9 yrs old and heard that opening song ""wanted dead or alive"" while harley (mickey rourke) is burnin across the desert, i was a fan for life.... though now i wondered why they didn't pick ccr's ""run thru the jungle"" for the opening credits..."
1,Harley Davison and the Marlboro man,"I am very disapointed because I pay for this movie on Dec 16, 2011 and never recived the dvd. I don't now what is the way for to make a complaint."
4,This CD has a little bit of everything.,Ever since I saw the movie I wanted the soundtrack but couldn't find. One of my favorite songs on the disc is C'mon. It's a great all-around rock and roll song. I'm definitely gonna order it as soon as possible.
4,Good Mindless Fun!,"If you are looking for the ""Meaning of Life"", then just keep looking, because you won't find it in this DVD.What you will find is a Movie which is just plain fun to watch!It has comedy, violence, high speed chases and the odd tear jerker.If you just want to put your feet up on a weekend and watch a Movie that is just plain fun, then this is a Movie for you."
4,This Ain't No Chick-Flick!,"This must be the ultimate mega-macho buddy flick. It's just good old fashioned good vs. evil, complete with fistfights, guns, bikes, babes and a rockin' soundtrack. The story is lame and the dialogue is ludicrous...so what? It's just mindless fun and adventure. If you analyse it too closely you're simply missing the point.Like Harleys? Then you've gotta see Mickey Roarke's lean, mean, low-ridin' Evo street-fighter!"
3,Great two wheel flick,"Although you'd never see this type of movie on one of those 100 best movies of all time shows, it's still great. Along with Charlie Sheen's ABOVE THE LAW this is one of my two favorite biker movies. It also makes me wonder why these two movies have not been released on dvd considering some of the complete garbage which have been sold in this format. It's one of those films which is just plain fun without being too taxing on the brain. Great for those who think 2 wheels are better than 4. Rent or buy it and have a blast."
5,"""Shoot the bastard, don't think, just shoot him! Shoot him!""",A wonderful tribute to trash action cinema with more than a hint of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid thrown into it!
2,Not bad enough to be enjoyable,"The movie was terrible, predictable, and made desparate attempts to distract attention from the plot with small arms fire. But you knew that. The reason to watch the movie is to see if it could shoot the moon and be so bad its enjoyable. Well, it failed. Minor amusement caused by ridiculous 80s trenchcoat stormtrooper kind of bad guys. Oh, but if you like motorcycles... its still boring, watch a better or worse film."
5,Gotta love riding!,"What's not to love when you put two friends, motorcycles and trouble together. Quite a tale with highs and lows but still entertaining."
1,MISS LEAD !,"No where in the process of ordering this DVD did it say that it would not play in the US. Once I received the DVD there was a warning that this MIGHT not play on electronics in the United States, once opened to see if it would play your are stuck with it! There is a no return policy. Needless to say it is useless to me. I would not ever order from this company again ! They were not honest from the start."
1,butch abd sun dance rip off,"It is the total rip off of the Butch Cassidy and Sundance movie. They copies the format, the story line and all we got is a big 'HUH?'"
4,Good Flick,"I'm not a big fan of Don Johnson, but teaming him with Mickey Rourke was a great idea. A great tale of good friends. Good movie for guys and girls."
4,Great little bag!,Perfect size for an SLR and one or two lenses or a lens and flash. My favorite feature is the pull out CF card holder. I've used this bag for over a year with no complaints.
5,"Great Bag, probably too big.","I believe this camera bag is quite big. But my wife is happy. Anyway, great material."
3,little to small for every thing to fit in,It is realy a nice bag however it to small for every thing to fit in if you have loads of accesories to fit in
4,"not what fans expected, but still very good!!!","""world in motion"", the follow-up album to his popular ""there is a party"" was a very anticipated album. When the album was realesed it had mixed reviews, and among the fans mostly was regarded as rather a poor album, apart from the 4 singles realesd from it. This album is not one of my favorites, but still is a good album. The best track is ""Pray""!!!!Jaymze"
5,I love this perfume!,I love perfume. I had this many years ago and couldn't find it at the store...I found it here and am very happy with it...it's almost time to order more!
1,"Good item, poorly packed","Ordered this for my wife as she has used it for years and was running out. Amazon did a poor job packing it and the bottle was broken when delivered. Naturally, amazon won't do a thing about it and I'm out $20! I also cannot return because it is listed as a ""hazardous material"". I expected more from amazon than what I got (which was nothing!)."
1,"Old product, not good","This perfume is old, I can't smell anything ..all I smell is anxiton...very bad.. I want to return but amazon won't allow me to. Very disappointed at this product"
1,A stinker!!,"I'm a really big Irene Kral fan, and love her dearly, but this one deserves to remain in obscurity. It's really weak material and poorly recorded. Poor Irene probably regretted ever recording this one. Buy any of her other albums instead and you won't be disappointed, especially ""The Band and I"" or ""Kral Space""."
3,What a Disappointment,"I notice some of the other reviews comment on technical glitches of this recording. I don't know anything about any techical glitches, I only know that the music herein is disappointing. And you are hearing this from a great fan of Irene Kral=me. Irene can't create great jazz all the time.If you want to hear the finest vocal jazz available, get Irene's other albums, especially ""Where is Love,"" and ""Second Chance."" They are definetely 5 star efforts, and recordings you should include in your library."
2,GREAT FOR PEOPLE WITH NEWER COMPUTERS! but...,"its great for people with newer computers, i.e ones with windows ABOVE windows 98. but why stop at just livin large? they should have put ALL the EP's into one game. i been talkin to all my sim fan friends, about how they should make something like this, and after only TWO YEARS(?)! they make it. they made too many ep's.. who ever bought ALL of them, they would have probably needed a whole computer just for THE EP'S! its good they made this newer version, but they should have added more than just ONE ep to the game.whoever's mad about buying all the ep's, they can just sell them.by the way, dont get SIMS ONLINE, unless you want to pay a MONTHLY FEE, every month just for playing a game..."
3,Dissapointing,"I'm 12 years old and I found it a very big dissapointment. There isn't a lot of new furniture you can buy and it is mostly a roman theme to it. I was happy with the new clothes selection though. I didn't like The Sims Creator. I thought you were able to design your sim body type, as in skinny, short, fat. You can't all you can do is make the clothes which are awful.I was very unhappy with this product and I do think that Maxis can do much better. I'm not sure if I would recommend this game? If you want to be dissapointed I guess. But, if you want some new clothes you could get it if you want to.I hope this helped with your decision on buying this game."
2,"Um, ok","don't understand the hype about the sims. you control people to do things. build houses, make friends, build skills, get money. amazing, what would they think of next."
1,TOTALLY unfair,"I think Maxis was being VERY unfair to their loyal customers who have bought all their products. They should have made a game like this when they first developed the sims. I will be sure to NOT ENCOURAGE people to buy this expansion pack. If I could, I would rate this expansion pack zero stars. >:("
3,"Kinda Fun, but mostly ANNOYING!","Overall, the concept of this game is fun and the writers had some really good ideas and it's funny in some ways. But what I HATE about this game is that you spend more than 70% of the time making them go to bed, eat, and go take a bath/shower!!! Like, I get it, but enough already... They have so little energy that you never have time to do anything fun. One or two activities, and they're down on the floor. WHAT?! Ha, don't even bother getting them a job b/c you will see them again...Just stick with the cheat codes. If this game did not have this one flaw (ie energy would last longer) then it would be awesome. I'm buying Sims 2 and I really hope that this will not be as big a problem!!!! Grrrr...."
3,fun but could be funer!,"Ok well I got thins in christmas 06 and it was great at first! I played non stop. Dont get me wrong its a great game but i would definatly suggest the sims 2 over this. For one thing your sims dont grow up and will always stay the same age but can die though from getting burned from cooking and things like that. And when your sim has a baby butterfly will just spin around and then theres a random crib right there!The sims can get promoted in jobs which is pretty cool and they get different salerys. Your sims are really ""under aged"" and never seem to take care of themselves. You always have to do it for them. I really do like this game but wouldnt suggest buying it when now there is the sims 2 which is alot more lifelike."
5,SIMS,I ordered The SIMS Deluxe Edition and only a couple of day later i recieved it in the mail. it came very fast and in great condition. The box and the cd. Also got it for a very nice rice. thank u
5,Excellent Game,This is one of my most favorite games. I was so happy to find it for such a reasonable cost. Very happy with this experience!
4,It is the BOMB!!!,"This game was the bomb,but the best is still the original one. The original sims is the best in my eyes. The sims has great moral values and you can learn alot from the game. The sims has great factual information and lets people know what it is like in the real world. It gives a great sources so as kids grow up they know what it is like to survive in the real world. The sims make people pay bills, go to work and several other things. There is plenty more to say about the game so just buy it and see what it is like. Trust me you won't regret it!!!"
2,Awesome Computer Game,"Two words: totally COOL!! This game is so fun, it's like real life! It becomes even funner when you get the expansion packs. You get to choose what your person looks like, design their house, buy them food and control them everywhere. If you get expansion packs, you can go on vacation, go into town, or get a pet!! It might be hard to earn money at first, so here's how you enter the cheat code:1.Press Ctrl+Alt+C, a box will appear in the upper right-hand corner2. Type the cheat code ROSEBUD in the box and you'll autimatically recieve $1000!Buy this now!!"
4,"It's Wonderful, but after a while it does get pretty old","I love the sims, it's fun, incredibly addicting (I mean incredibly- you can find stories of people who've died in their rooms trying to get their sim to the top of their career track)but for me at least playing it over, and over again, it all got a tad old, and pointless (which is why I'm holding my breath for thesims2 which'll have 10X as much variety), I used to spend half my life on the game, gaining weight, skipping meals, yearning to get home from tennis and sailing (it was during the summer) so I could get home and make a really cool house, I was a sad case. But for me, and many of my friends, I went on one day, craving to see some of the great new stuff I had downloaded the day before and suddenly I was striked with a flash of unenthusiasm- and haven't played the game since. That's the thing with The Sims it will one day give up on you, and you will give up on the sims."
5,Very addicting!,"Never knew what all the hype was about the SIMS games until I got this one. My 8 year old daughter and I are absolutely hooked on it. And, the funny thing is...it's not even a game!We can't wait to buy some expansion packs and see our SIMS go on vacations, etc.Buy this game and expect to stay up late and spend hours at your computer! It's fun and worth it!"
4,Old but gold,"This game is not ""up to date"" with the sims now, But its GREAT i recommend it to everyone. It has really cool features and what not you should buy it!"
3,Blah,So I know it needs windows XP/95/98 to run.. but so does the original SIMS game I bought and it runs fine on my windows 7 laptop... I didnt do anything special to make it install or run properly.. so I was hoping for the same from this game.. and its not what I am getting!!! I am so mad! I want to see the stuff thats not in the other version! Oh well.. I will keep trying..
4,Great marketing EA,"You would expect this and finally they came out with a deluxe edition instead of buying two seperate games. It is a great deal, cheaper than the sims alone. This comes with The one that started it all ""The sims"" and livin large. With neighborhoods and the people and you control their lives, by being messy or clean. Being married and having kids or single. You can oick jobs like police officers, or even a job in the military. If you have these two packs then don't buy it...........But wait, marketing comes in because they add new stuff exclusive to only this pack and nowhere else like furniture. So they make you have to buy this pack. That is why their stock is so high! This pack DOES not include the other 1,000 expansion packs. Great marketing EA, smart people, well they are located in Redwood City. In the Silicon Valley, the heart of where technology is..."
2,well...,This game was really fun but i couldn't play it for more than an hour or it would freeze and computer would go black. it takes a really long time to install. It also caused the sound to go out but my dad fixed it. it is a addicting game though but not worth it.
4,Highly Addictive,"I am not a huge fan of action or shoot-'em up games. I tend to sway more to the strategy and simulation genre. I waited quite a while to put my hands on this game, as I heard the addictive qualities that The Sims possesed. Well, I broke down and finally grabbed it from my Gold Box on Amazon. When it arrived, I promptly spent 17 of 24 hours plopped in front of my computer slaving away to this game! I really enjoy it, but after mastering the day to day doldroms, what more is there?"
5,The Sims that did not come!,"I am sure this is a great program, but ordered it from ""Bargin Depot"" and after 40 days have never seen it. They charge your credit Card and Rip you off. Check out the other ratings I am not alone."
1,Installation,"Met all the system requirements to install this game but needless to say, was unable to open. Tried 3 separate times to install. The first time I gave the serial number on back of plastic container and it started to install but took FOREVER. Got frustrated and backed out. Tried again this morning and couldn't even get THAT FAR. What's the problem?Patricia"
2,Another expansion pack?,"This game just keeps on getting more and more expansion packs! More expansion packs=more ways to mess up your computer. There has been 7 expansions thus far. When an expansion pack comes out for the sims another follows. Its crazy I tell you, CRAZY! Take my advice save some money and wait until the Sims 2 comes out!"
4,So Addicting!,"I love this! the only problem I have, is you have to have a lot of time to play it. Not only is it addicting, but the characters are very demanding. Although it is a very fun game to play... I reccomend it to anyone who likes mindless entertainment."
1,Too overrated,"I bought this game thinking it would be fun, I'm glad I waited for the price to go down before buying this. I didn't know there was time, a 24 hour day, was used in the game. The problem with this, at least for me, is 1) the time passes too quickly and I have to rush all the time to get things done, and 2) no strategy in the game, everything is linear in our goals. One Sim hour equals one minute in real time, and we can't set the speed slower. There's no adventure, no exploration in The Sims. What we do throughout the game is run our Sims around trying to keep our various moods in the up side of the scale. This quickly becomes routine and boring. I'd rather be playing a 3D action game for two hours straight rather then sending Sims to bed and to work and siting at the table eating over and over."
1,Dont waste your money,"First, Let me say, the reason I gave this a 1 star rating isnt the game itself, I havent gotten to play it yet! Not from this disc. I ordered it brand new, it was delivered, I unwrapped it, and tried to install it. The serial # EA GAMES printed on it (which you have to have to install it on your computer), is invalid!!!! And, I cant get an answer from their tech support/customer service on this. I have found others who have bought this version with the exact same problem. If you can get this in a jewel case, good. It seems when they come in the case shown on this page, the serial #'s wont work, and you have to go through a huge hassel to get it fixed. ***This is not an amazon problem, it is an EA GAMES problem"
3,good game but scratched,"bought this game ""like new"" but it was scratched and wouldnt show it right away. after about 5 or 10 minutes of play, it would drag and create large pixels around the screen. it was a good game but... not good quality"
4,The Sims,A fairly decent game.It can get a little boring but thats why you buy the expansion packs to go along. WIth the expansions it seems the sims don't get along with each other quite as well. More bickering and such.To me its easy to keep the sim happy.
2,Very Monotonous,"I bought this game a few weeks ago expecting a game I could play all summer. I got bored with it in three days. All you do on this game is tell your Sim to eat, sleep, go to work, take a shower, use the toilet, and watch TV. While your Sim is at work or sleeping you watch the time go by. The graphics are horrible. You can hardly see your Sim. The only fun things in this game are that you get to build your houses and make out with girls. You do the same things every day. Don't waste your money on this game. The Sims 2 is much, much better."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 2000,"just what i said, really disappointing to say the least, i have access to WIN XP and some others but.. it's still going to be a pain the arse.otherwise i'd give it 4 stars."
2,"Ok, but gets boring fast","This game doesn't have a set goal for you to reach, so unless you find yourself with hours of time to kill, this probably isn't as great as people have said. It's pretty fun, but a big time waster. If you let your people get depressed and they don't have a job, forget about it. They'll be too depressed to get happy and too depressed to find a job, so they'll just starve to death. Also, you spend WAY too much time telling them to clean up after themselves. Even on ""auto"" mode, they don't do much on their own. Stick with SimCity!"
1,Horrible!,This game was the most boring game I have ever played! All you do is watch little people sit around and grow hungry and have to go to the bathroom. Thats it. After ten minutes of playing this game I almost fell asleep in my chair. Do not buy this game!
5,BEST Computer Game EVER!!!!!!!!,"Awesome! Before I bought this game , I read the reveiws on this site. A lot them were five stars, so i thought it would be a good game. Boy, was I wrong! It's not good, IT'S GREAT! I you don't know whether to buy it or not, Go For It!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Fun At First,"The sims is a very fun game when you first buy it. But when you do possibly everything you can do on the sims, it gets very boring. Sometimes on the create a sim mode, my game keeps on crashing preventing me from creating a family. It will also crash randomly sometimes while I am playing. The graphics are not that good either. I would recommend that people should just wait for the Sims 2 to come out."
2,think twice before buying this new edition to the sims,"Let me state that I'm a gamer. I bought Deluxe and was so excited to play it. I got home and waited for it to load...forever. I got on it and waited for the ""inverting career ladder"" deal to load...forever. Then I created a family and started. After about ohhh... 8 minutes I was bored. I thought the sims was great and I thought this would blow my mind. but,it seems to me that the sims, no matter how many expansions you buy, is lacking something. I reserve to cheats usually. Hey, I just want my sims to have a good life instead of (when I dont use cheats) what I usually end up with. A sort of high school dropout attitude/job with a Willie Nelson era house. I just can never put my finger on whats wrong but Maxis should think about there next sim game more carefully instead of shooting them out."
1,"Wow, what a wonderful game. NOT!","Well, after a great start, the game decided to crash on me, completely negating everything i did in the game which took a good 6 or 7 hours of non-stop playing. But that's just the beginning. When i decided that it was futile to try to continue, i did what anyone else would and attempted to uninstall and reinstall the game. First i had to reboot my system 3 times in order to get it to reinstall, then when it did get finished, it wouldn't start up. To add insult to injury, the ""Hot Date"" expansion pack did not want to install either. Folks, if y'all have a lot of time on your hands and want to do something fun, get the heck off the bandwagon and watch some paint dry. It may be boring, but paint is reliable enough to dry. I wouldn't waste the money for this game, but unfortunately i already have. It gets boring quick and only works when it wants to.thank you"
1,figures,"i just installed the Hot Date and Vacation EP's. I bought the DE version and those EP's at the same time from amazon.com. now i am upset (not at amazon.com) but the game itself. the deluxe version installed with just those 2 EP's causes my system to run on very low memory. I run a P4 2.0, 80gig HD, 512 ddr ram, 128 bit graphic and sound cards. Anyway, when playing i noticed the game was running slow, come to find out my ram was down to 55mb-65mb, which is very bad to run that low on a system that never runs that low. any lower i will get a message stating to close some programs. i tried restaring the computer and i was running at 320mb ram, i started the game, paused it, checked my usage on ram, it was back down to 57.9mb available. waste of money"
2,Not as good as everyone claims it is,"I didn't really enjoy The Sims as much as i thought i would since it's just like real life(pay bills water the garden watch T.V. go to the bathroom, eat ect.). and for another thing theres not too much depth to the game. all you can do in this version is stay in your house and run the lives of the people you create. to get the most out of this game you are gonna be shellin out big bucks for all the expansion packs. the only good (well actually funny)thing that you can do is kill the sims you made by starving, drowning, or burning them. there might be some of you out there"
4,Great marketing EA,"You would expect this and finally they came out with a deluxe edition instead of buying two seperate games. It is a great deal, cheaper than the sims alone. This comes with The one that started it all ""The sims"" and livin large. With neighborhoods and the people and you control their lives, by being messy or clean. Being married and having kids or single. You can oick jobs like police officers, or even a job in the military. If you have these two packs then don't buy it...........But wait, marketing comes in because they add new stuff exclusive to only this pack and nowhere else like furniture. So they make you have to buy this pack. That is why their stock is so high! This pack DOES not include the other 1,000 expansion packs. Great marketing EA, smart people, well they are located in Redwood City. In the Silicon Valley, the heart of where tchnology is..."
3,Lets say okay form a child that owns all the games,"I Love this game. it really cool. but ig you buy it and think all games are on it no there not its just the sims and the sims liveing large. you could say i own all the games. but i took this one pack beacuse it was not a great game. i have the sims and the sims livieng large. so why do i need it? if you buy this game good luck, some times the games when you turn them off the screen goes black and sometimes you can not get out of the blackness!"
4,review of the sims,this game is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is fun to build the houses and desighn you own people.you should really get this game.its reallly fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,This game rocks!,"I first bought the Sims when it came out. After losing both the original Sims and Living Large discs, I figured buying this game would be a suitable replacement. I was right! I love this game, and it's so much fun to cast yourself as a Sim and steal your Sim's best friend's boyfriend. There's also the money codes, which are very helpful. The only thing that deducts from the Sim's appeal is that it gets old, fast. But to me that's a good thing, because after a while I HAVE TO play this game again and again. It's a very fun game, and the expansion packs just add to the fun."
5,The Sims ' s Deluxe Edition is great !!!!,"The Sims will gives hours of fun and its pretty fun laughing at them fights and listening to their strange mixure of all of the human language .... Basically you create them, build their homes and run their life and ruin their life if you like. It a fun game and you get more furniture and and you can a make a sim face out of your photo it all in fun you will enjoy it. I am a sim head"
4,great,"Have you ever wanted to control a human? Well, now you can with The Sims. The Sims is a really cool game, however, you need a fast computer to make it work. Also, parents, you should be warned there are some inapropriate things in this game. I recommend it for everyone over 12."
4,Expand eventually,"As everyone states, this game is addictive; HOWEVER, eventually it looses its' steam. If you purchase The Sims I suggest that you also purchase an expansion at the same time or soon thereafter. What happens is that you will get bored with being in the house or in the neighborhood all the time and the only way to get out of the neighborhood is to buy an expansion. It is fun to play awhile with your sims in the house and to build new neighborhoods but as mentioned earlier the massive amount of micromanaging gets frustrating and all you really would like to do is see your sims interact with others in an environment that you do not constantly have to change/update. I find more enjoyment out of watching personal interactions between sims than building houses."
4,great game for CONTROL FREAKS,"This game has brought my grandson many hours of pure CONTROL fun.There are some limits, that are sometimes, frustrating, like the prices, they remind me of the original MONOPOLY. However, Rosebud comes to the rescue, which makes it seem more modern, since most people are living on credit cards, anyway. They have set up the game to make the characters speak their own language, SIMLISH, it sounds like gibberish, and is really annoying!IT IS SOMEWHAT educational, however, because it causes a personto consider the things that are necessary, to live in the real world."
5,Excellent!,"I'm glad to see the whole concert in one package. If you are fortunate enough to have the 5-disc Time Traveller set, then there are five or six songs on the bonus disc that should have been included in the original Red Rocks CD. Now that it has been reissued in its entirety, we have the whole concert. This was an excellent performance by the Moody Blues and a daring one at that since it was their first time ever playing in concert with a real live orchestra. It worked out beautifully. I just love the extended version of Legend Of A Mind. What a tease Ray is with this one. This is a must have for any Moody Blues fan. If you have the original Red Rocks CD.....can it!"
4,"BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, GREAT GROUP, LOUSY MIX","To start, let me say, that I am a Moodies freak. This cd set has the beautiful performance from Red Rocks with Ray. (Norda I love you, but Ray is THE MAN). My only complaints about this collection is that whomever did the mixing, didn't treat this as a concert performance, with gradual transitions and band banter. They chose to go from song to song as if this was a studio mix. IT IS ANNOYING and gives a disjointed listening experience. My daughter could have mixed and finished this better. Otherwise, this is the Moody Blues."
3,two of the worst sounding CDs I've ever purchased,Too bad one of my all time favorite groups is being presented on what is one of the worst sounding CD sets I've ever purchased.Probably sounds OK on cheap headphones at about 32kbit encoding.Don't waste your money if you have a high-end system and were hoping to enjoy some beautiful Moody Blues music.
5,Classis Pauline Wilson,"For fans of Seawind and Yataka, they will enjoy 100% Pauline Wilson. My favorites are ""Follow Your Road"" and ""Walking My Way To You"", but the whole CD is great. This is a biased review because I've loved Pauline's voice since the first time I heard it."
4,nice n easy,"Good album, from in my opinion, one of the world's most outstanding living female vocalists. This is real easy listening, and is mellow jazz the way it should be. Yet, I long to hear Pauline extend her repetiore slightly - with her superb talent, I would like to hear her range over a few more styles of jazz. But that's to take nothing away from this fine album. Well done Pauline - you are a jazz mucisian par excellance!"
2,MAYBE NEXT TIME!,"I was and still is a great fan of the SEAWIND and i love the songs and the vocal of Pauline. After seawind, I had been looking and searching for a long time for Pauline recording. When I saw this recording, ordered it immediately. However I was rather dissapointed, the materials in this recording could not project her vocal power. Her voice still there, but far off from the standard as in seawind. The best song in this cd is a Seawind's number- still the orginal version is far better. Hoping for a reunion of the SEAWIND with Pauline."
2,The Ending Spoiled the Book.,"Like two of the reviewers below, this was also my first Fern Michaels book. Quite honestly, it will probably be my last. Had I written this review before the last chapter, I would have given it 3 stars and probably read another of her novels. The story was fun, some of the characters were fun and quirky (loved the crazy mother) if not a bit cliched (like the FBI agent), and some of the suspense scenes worked well. But the ending was such a big disappointment. No surprises, rather abruptly ended, like she ran out of energy at the finish line. I wish her editor would have suggested she rethink and possibly expand the last chapter."
1,Don't buy books at the grocery store,"I might dust off my science fiction novel if writing of this quality can make it to the best sellers list. Which book did she write that was a NY Times best seller? The characters are over dramatized and flat. At least this book had a story outline. My husband brought me another called ""Vendetta"" and it is boring and unbelivable. But I trudge through it hoping it may redeem itself. I would believe she is writing for an adolescent audience but the language and situations are a bit rough for that audience.I will never read another of this author's books."
3,Very confusing,"I don't recommend this book because it is very confusing. It tries to put Brazilian portuguese and continental Portuguese into one. Therefore, you're learning a mixed dialect and won't be able to fully understood in either places. Also, you're pronunciation is going to be awful. The tapes switch from Continental portuguese to Brazilian Portuguese without even indicating it and the two different kinds of Portuguese languages are pronounced differently. For people looking for strictly Brazilian Portuguese or Continental Portuguese this isn't the course."
3,"Good Book, Very Helpful, But...","This is a valuable and beneficial book. It contains relevant and up-to-date information, but there were many typographical errors. These ranged from incorrect spelling (in both English and Portuguese)to obvious mis-translations of basic and familiar words and phrases. I have only a slight background in Portuguese, and was able to spot many mistakes. These may go unnoticed by a novice reader of the language. Nonetheless, when completed with this course you should have no problems in conversing with Brazilian and European speakers."
3,A pity for the too-many errors.,"I bought the book and got to page 91 so-far... I think the method of learning Portuguese with English translation should work fine for English speaking students.What bothers me is that there are too many errors in spelling, and translation. It seems like whoever wrote the dialogues and exercises was not the same person who translated them, otherwise they would have noticed that some examples that were chosen do not translate well. This results in confusion and contradiction along the book. If you already know some portuguese and aware of these errors, you can benefit from this book... otherwise, find another."
2,Ultimate Portuguese Book and Cassette Set,"It is somewhat a good set, but it has a lot of typographical errors.There is a section that does not give people an explanation as to why they use the word ""meia"", instead of the number 6, when making phone calls. I do not recommend the Living Language Ultimate Portuguese book and cassette set to anyone."
3,Good book but out dated now (8/2010),"This is the only book I could find on parallel IO for HPC. It is a useful working reference and a good intro to parallel IO. The major issue now is that the book discusses outdated technology as of my reading (8/2010). Since the books publication much of the technology discussed has either fallen by the wayside to be replaced with other technologies or has advanced significantly. The most striking example is in the treatment of parallel file systems. The Lustre fs, the most prevalent parallel file system in 2010 is not even mentioned! On the positive side the treatment of MPI-IO is pretty good, and still relevant. It would be great if the author updated the book in a new edition."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book recently to enhance my knowledge of parallel I/O to improve a climate model built on MPI technology. To my disappointment, the author spent less than 1/10th of the book to actual parallel I/O programming. And the mere effort is a list of a few MPI subroutines. The rest of the book tries to cover everything about high performance I/O but does not convey anything USEFUL. I feel the price is way too high for such a mediocre book that talks about too broad a topic and fail to focus on anything specific. I glanced through the book and read the chaptors that talked a little bit about MPI and scientific data management. And now the book is gathering dust on my shelf."
1,"The book is wildly off track, poor characterization overall","The author did not have to go very far to make substantial errors in this book, The title itself is an error, since these Bedouins are Palestinians, and not Israeli's (They would take great offense to being called Israeli's. This author is definately an outsider looking in."
1,Not quite...,The nomadism of the Bedouin in the Negev was stripped by Israel policy. Now they are finding that their culture and way of life is unacceptable in Israel. This book hinds the true facts. I would not recomend it.
5,All the basics are covered for enlivening nonfiction writing,"Writing Dramatic Nonfiction isn't just another guide to producing nonfiction; it overs a particular style of dramatic nonfiction which uses fictional drama to spice and enhance nonfiction accounts. From using anecdotes and character development to handling dialogue, this covers all the basics of enlivening nonfiction efforts."
2,Very old-school space opera,"Stereotypical old sf, of the ""Swords & Starships: galactic civilization loses all tech except space flight and reverts to feudalism"" trope. Which trope is creaky and dusty enough as it is, but the writing isn't at all poetic or up-to-date even by the standards of sf in 1968--I mean, that's the year of ""Stand on Zanzibar,"" ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"" and ""2001."" The language is flat and pedestrian, the characters are two-dimensional at best, and the pacing is uneven - feels like the ending got rushed to meet a deadline. The underlying storyline could actually be worthy of a good book, but this isn't it."
4,Cage Album: Simply Dope,"If there were 4 and a half star options I would give it to this album. ""Good Morning"" starts the album off with a bang with an energy-filled and aggravated beat by El-P. He also closes the project with classic production on the title track ""Hells Winter"". Throughout this album, Cage takes you on a dark ride through his mind,and with other production by RJD2, Blockhead, Camu Tao,and PAWL, this is sure to stay in the player for awhile. This album contains a level of feeling that many may have thought Cage was incapable of accomplishing, but with tracks like ""Shoot Frank"" fans who know cage will be surprised. He also seems to have shed his obsession with drugs; word is he's clean, so this album has much more than just one topic of subject matter. Go out and buy this one, you won't be dissappointed."
3,Cage live is sub par,I had a listen to the new Cage album and it has it's highlights. It is much better then the first recording. The main problem that I have is his live performance that I witnessed. On Dec 10 I watched Cage and Camo Tau in Baltimore and it was slacking. All in all it was one of the worst live hip-hop shows that I have ever seen. Therefore my opinion of Cage is tainted.
1,Cage fell off,I'm sorry but I liked Cage's earlier stuff. Movies for the Blind was great and so was his other dark stuff. Unfortunitely now he's turned into a soft little p---y. I seriously miss the old Cage and I hope Cage makes another dark album. This on the other hand is a total letdown and is not good at all.
5,Everyone should learn about raw milk! Excellet DVD!,"Extremely informative and interesting information.Easy to watch and listen to. It breaks the myths about milk allergies, explains pasturization and homogenization and could heal/solve many health conditions! Buy one for you and one to loan out! (No. I'm not a friend of the company, just a happy customer of Organic Pastures raw milk products!"
4,good source of sample resumes,"This book is a good source of sample finance resumes. Other good and recommended resources for finance careers are the Vault Guide to the Top Finance Firms, the Vault Career Guide to Investment Banking, and the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews. Also try the harvard guide to finance careers."
4,Useful guide,"This book is quite useful for a finance job search. Another good guide on the subject is the Vault Reports Guide to Investment Banking, which includes actual finance interview questions and answers."
3,Eh...,"I know that there are three beautiful songs on this CD. I also know that Fuel is great in concert (I've seen them twice), but this CD is almost exactly like Sunburn. If it were a little different or if they experimented a little with their songs, I probably would have given it a better rating. Don't let me stop you from buying it, though. I think it was worth the [price] I dropped for it just for ""Bad Day"" and ""Innocent."""
3,"Disappointing, compared to the first.","When I first got Fuel's debut album, it blew me away. It was, and still is, one of the best albums I've ever heard. So naturally, I was the first to run out and buy this album. But, I was a little bit let down. There are some good songs here, but a lot of them are just dull. ""Last Time"" is a great song that should have gotten more airplay, ""Hemmorhage in my Hands"" has some really cool guitar playing (he can flatpick really fast, I don't know how he does it, I always hit the wrong strings), and ""Bad Day"" is probably my favorite of the album. It made my girlfriend cry. ""Innocent"" is okay, but a bit overplayed. I don't know if they'll ever make another ""Sunburn"" again, but they sure didn't here. Maybe next time, but I bet the first will always be the best."
5,Suprisingly catchy and real,"When I first heard Fuels's previous album, i was a aware that the band was succesfull, and thought the songs were modestly good, though they couldn't compare to my favorite Alice in Chains. When my friend bought this cd, I heard him playing hemorage in my hands from his car, and i was suprised it was the same band. I immedietly gathered some spare change and bought the cd, which I must say is now on my wall of fame. If you like intelligent, powerful rock, then fuel is the drink of choice."
4,"Not what I expected, glad I bought it...","I was very hesitant to buy Something Like Human when it came out; I was never a big fan of much music during the ""grunge"" years or shortly after. I simply prefer music that is more fun rather than stuff that has lyrics that are about how much everything sucks. Now while the lyrics are fairly dark - they are done so with context and meaning. The ""stories"" of Bad Day and Innocent show this. The music also has more melody than alot of the rock that was around at the time. Brett Scallions is a very good vocalist, I really like the way he delivers the songs with emotion and power.Song Highlights include: Last Time, Hemorrhage, Bad Day, Prove, Knives and Innocent.Overall, Something Like Human is a very solid album with some great moments and Fuel, as a band, show their talents. Definitely worth a listen."
4,Ear for rock music,"when i first heard hermorrhage, i really felt life was worth living, its the kind of music you never get tired of following the rhythm, i doubt is fuel can come up with a better track through out their entire career."
5,Wonderful!!,This is the greatest cd I have ever owned (of course not including Sunburn). I love it! Fuel knows how to express any emotion with music and without being like boy-bands. I LOVE Hemorrhage (In My Hands). It's the greatest song in the world! Anyone who likes bands like Nickelback and Linkin' Park will love this cd! Fuel rocks!!
5,Awesome CD!,"This CD is great. ""Innocent,"" ""Hemmorage,"" ""Bad Day,"" and ""EmptySpaces"" are so cool. Almost all of the songs are good, but these are the best. I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes rock."
1,Nickelback's new album is terrible,"and this new Default album isn't too great either. Or...wait, this is Fuel. How silly of me. Really, is anyone as sick of these grunge throwbacks as I am? We all know the formula by now, or should. Subpar lyrics about whatever type of white boy pain, subpar music with energetic but boring drumming, unimaginative basslines, whatever guitars, and 'emotional' vocals. But Fuel just makes it worse. Bad Day? Jesus, the lyrics to that song are LAUGHABLE. I'll admit, Hemorrhage was a good song, but it got played to death and all the strings get on your nerves. Indeed, Fuel abuse the strings as much as Jimmy Eat World, but at least JEW utilizes their strings efficiently. All the songs sound the same, the lyrics are awful, the music doesn't elevate past radio standards; jeesh, why do people still buy corporate, boring rock? I shouldn't worry; in a few years, Fuel will sit alongside The Calling and Wheatus in the used CD section..."
4,Good mood Music,"This cd is difinitly one of those cd's you listen to when you've had a bad day (hence the song ""Bad Day) I really like this cd, but it's not my favorite cd of all time. I would recommend it though 'cuz it is good!!"
4,growing,"Fuel's first album was okay, but this is where i caught all the motivation at. ""Hemmorage"" was too good of a single for me to not get the album 'cuz there was no retail availible of the single.They aren't what I call ""AAA"" although others do. They've gotten more rock and a moody rythm."
1,still have not got what I payed for not happy at all,I payed for this product and have e-mail and e-mail and have not got what I ordered and im not happy one bit about this and i will not order frow this one again I do not blame amazon it is not rigth to take someones money...
4,very good cd from fuel,"this is a very good cd from fuel. possibly the one down side to this album is track 7 ""easy"". the problem wiht this song is that u need the lyric sheet (comes with the cd) because the words in the verses are so slurred and quiet. and the chorus is way to slow. other than that this is an awesome albumthis got 4 instead of a 5 because of track 7"
3,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to the new CD, especially after hearing Hemorrhage on the radio. I loved ""Sunburn"" and was hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately, I'll have to wait a little longer because ""Something Like Human"" is very disapponting. I like the lyrics in almost of of the songs. They are very soulful and mature. The music however...it just sounds bad. Way too much guitar on some songs and too much of everything on others. It didn't flow well for me. The songs that sound best are not surprisingly the ballads which showcase Brett Scallions wonderful voice-""Hemorrhage"" and ""Bad Day."" I've listened to this CD about 6 times so far, hoping it would grow on me. Sadly, it hasn't. Oh well. I'm still a fan."
2,Major Let-Down,"I bought this CD because I loved ""Hemorrage in My Hand""; then I heard ""Bad Day"" on the radio, too. I figured the rest of the CD would be more great songs like those. It also didn't hurt that one of the members in the band is a cousin of my friend, and he grew up about 20 minutes from here. Anyway, I am more than disappointed with this CD. It's like they picked the only 2 songs from the album that they knew people would like and put them on the radio first so they could pay some bills before people realized how bad the rest of the CD is."
1,Throwing Copper mixed with Firehouse,"Fuel is one of those bands that releases a ""new"" album and you think - Hey I've heard this before . In fact , when I first heard ""In My Hands "" I thought it sounded remarkably like ""Selling The Drama' by the band Live . The rest of the album is more of same . Most of the time sounding like Creed, Live , or 80's hair band Firehouse . (Yikes!) Lyrics are as pretty standard alt confusion. Many people will remember the wonderful song ""Shimmer"" from their breakthrough album . Unfortunately , that kind of emotion and creativity is long gone . Hey , they are still getting paid . And that's all matters isn't it ?"
1,UNORIGINAL MUSIC FROM A BAND W/ AN UNORIGINAL NAME,"I HAVE TO GIVE THE GUYS CREDIT, THEY CERTAINLY ARE SUCCESSFUL, IF YOU CONSIDER, CONSTANT RADIO PLAY, AND LEGIONS OF TEENAGE AND FEMALE FANS. THIS IS MUSIC FOR PEOPLE THAT LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.NO THANKS.BUT THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL,--BY THE WAY DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL ""FUEL"" FROM D.C.? THEY WERE A MUCH BETTER BAND. THIS BAND PROBABLY GOT THEIR NAME FROM THE METALLICA ALBUM."
4,Great Cd,"Fuel's new cd ""Something like Human,"" is an awesome display of this band's talent. It is a great follow up to their first and also platium album ""Sumburn"". Led by lead singer and quitarist Brett Scallions, the band produces a powerful cd with the combination of great instument playing and a great voice. The cd is great through every song, but two songs really stand out ""Last Time"" and ""Hemorrhage."" The cd is going to please anyone who enjoyed their last cd, and probably anyone who likes this type of music. The cd has great lyrics in every song, and all ages can listen to the cd because the language they use is good. The band will surely come out with more cds in the near future."
3,Something Like OK,"Creed isn't the only rock band that's cornered the market on hook-laden guitar riffs and earnest, raspy vocals. Take Fuel's latest CD, ""Something Like Human"", which is chock full of these ingredients; and though they don't necessarily improve on the formula, it still doesn't make for a bad listen. Special standouts include the current radio hit ""Hemmorrhage (in my hands)"" and the surprisingly empathic ""Bad Day."""
5,Hemorrhage,Hemorrhage qUITE possibly the greatest song ever. The first time i saw the video i dint know who it was i found out it was fuel then i bought something like human and listened to Hemorrhage like 5000 times please get this cd it rocks so much
3,I'm so disapointed...,"Assez déu du nouveau disque, ils avaient un excellent CD en main avec Sunburn, mais celui-ci est beaucoup moin bon que l'autre. Il y a bien sur Hemorrhage (In My Hands) qui est absolument le genre de musqieu qu'ils nous ont habituer, et il y a aussi Bad Day qui est vraiment transportante... mais les autres? POurquoi avoir autant changer de style alors qu'ils l'avaient à 100%, ils etait dans le genre de musique auquelles ils nous ont habituer. Dommage, c'est un CD que je regrette pas d'avoir acheter mais que je ne recommande pas necessairement, puisqu'il n'est pas a la hauteur de cette formation. J'ai déjà vu mieux, et je m'attendais a beaucoup plus que cela, vraiment beaucoup plus, meilleur chance la prochaine fois les boys, il faudra repasser pour se qui est de mon cas. Désolé."
5,Way Cool....,"this is probably one of the best SACD's that I have. The music sounds like Billy Joel is sitting in my living room. I especially like the fact that the sound fills my living room. Especially given the fact that its multichannel instead of just stereo. Until I got SACD's, I didn't realize what a misjustice CD's do the music. I just wish more albums would get released on SACD (I'm talking to you Pink Floyd)."
1,The vocals don't match the music,"I would believe that I was doing something wrong, but the ""Toys in the Attic"" SACD that I bought at the same time sounds Very good, so the vocals in the center channel of this SACD being completely Off sounding was a big disappointment.Hard to quantify, but there is -nothing- on the center channel except the vocals, no blending at all, and there is no reverb to match it to the rest of the music. Best comparison I can give is that the music is playing on ""speakers"" in a 40 foot room, and you're standing right next to Billy as he sings along, un-miked. Just bizarre.system is oppo through 6 monster analog cables to Yamaha 2400's analog in, multichannel input selected for playback."
4,The Blueprint,"This is almost certainly ""The Classic Billy Joel"" album. It was his breakthrough and also his most enduring.It touches all the bases from rock (Only the Good Die Young & Moving Out), pop (Just the Way You Are and She's Always a Woman), faux gospel (Everybody Has a Dream) to those 70's production pieces (Italian Restaurant and The Stranger). Strong from beginning to end.This is the template for his career and is my pick for the one album of his to get; even over the various greatest hits albums."
2,Useless Figure,This toy blows. The only reason to buy her is for the Apocalypse part. Even if you like her character this toy is horrid. I don't know much about her but from what I saw in the comic she comes with the toy fails to do justice. I'm pretty disappointed as I typically love ML figures. This one looks like one of those tiny toys you get as an accessory to another figure. Her hands are pathetic. Her arms suck too. It's like they didn't care. Also what is up with her head? It's like twice the size it should be. I hate how they purposely put the best part of the BAF with the crappiest figure in a set.I recommend this figure to finish off your Apocalypse but other then that I find this figure to be pretty pointless. You can't even sell her. People are basically giving her away on Ebay and still no one wants her.
1,Perceived shortage,"Although many of the figures are incredibly cool, Marvel Legends is really starting to tick me off with their manipulitive marketing. There is always a ""perceived shortage"" of certain figures. Get it together and make everything available at the same time! I saw this figure at Wal-mart and passed it up because frankly it looked bad, I didn't know the character, and they didn't have the rest of the figures in stock. Then as time passed I ended up getting the other figures later and I can't complete Apocolypse because she is the onlly figure I don't have. I don't even care about this figure but I've got these other stupid body parts with no head for Apocolypse lying around. I'm going to quit collecting after I find this one."
5,40 is everything he says it is,I first bought this book about the time I turned 40 and laughed all the way through. He really hits the foibles of middle age. I bought another copy as our son was about to turn 40. Example: 40 is--reading the retirement plan letters from your company instead of throwing them away.
3,Walker Payne Movie,I would have enjoyed this movie more if the sex scenes were notas graphic. Very good portrayal of rural America. Strong anddetermined performances by Jason Patric and Sam Sheppard.The pit bull dogs were not harmed in this movie which was verygood to know.
2,Walker Payne,"This movie doesn't move very quickly.........the story itself is good........to be honest I only purchased this movie because my son was an extra in the dog fight scene........Walker Payne was filmed in York County, SC 5 years ago and my son home from Clemson for the summer needed a job desperatley.......mjd"
3,slow build up,"I'd say Walker Payne's biggest problem is that the storyline moves at an incredibly slow pace. Now I love movies that take place in a small town in the middle of nowhere and revolve around a small group of people just as much as anyone else, but the storyline never really got going or picked up- it was just the same boring pace from beginning to end. The fact the film has a noticeable made-for-TV appearance about it doesn't help either. The beginning of the film when the father was eager to see his daughters was probably the best part of the entire movie. Not worth watching."
2,Probably not worth the time,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who knows I'm always on the look-out for good erotic literature. I have to say that in comparison with the Black Lace novels I have read, this collection is somewhat lacking. The stories tend to be long, some with numerous pages of background information between small snipits of sexaul action.I would not recommend this book based on the fact that I felt more frustrated after having read it. A couple of the stories were good, and those are the only ones I now read; but the majority did not capture my attention as I think an excellantly written erotic tale usually does. ..."
2,Too Much S&M,"This book should be titled ""The Erotic Bondage Reader"" or ""The Erotic S&M Reader."" Most of the stories involve the whipping, spanking, humiliation, or tying up of women. Which is fine if you are into that, but this is not ""general"" erotica as the book seems to claim."
4,Terrific Supers game with Little Support....,"It's too bad Guardians of Order (GOO) has ended support for thier fine entry into the Supers RPG field. I helped playtest this edition along with my RPG group in Cincinnati, Ohio.This is a terrific and underrated game. The GM does have to put alot into it to make it work as some of the powers can be a little vague. The tri stat system works well here and if you have played BESM, you should have no trouble picking this up.Like any RPG the players are what can make or break a game. The rules are well written and easy to understand. The interiors have some great art work (bested only by Green Ronin's Mutants & Masterminds) and the layout is easy on the eyes.There are many sample characters within as well. The back ground info in the book is very interesting and the book is just a good read in general.Pick yourself up a copy. You will not be disappointed."
5,Space pens are the best,"Space pens always write. Need I say any more? This pen has a feel and a professional style to it while it is purple (and a beautiful purple at that), its still elegant. I will use it both for work and personal stuff."
1,Useless,The game for which this card supplies game time has been out of service for over 2 years. It was MMO game & it was fun when it was online but since noone can play it anymore this gametime card is only useful as a nostalgic item or a coaster.
3,Card Not Required,"The card is NOT required to play the game, It is only needed if you do not have a credit card/Debit Card to pay for the subscription fee, or if you dont want it on your card. The game card just allows those who cannot pay for game by other means they accept.. Play the game.Note: If you do NOT have Credit/Debit Card.. You will NEED this to play. Otherwise it is not required to have."
3,Watch Out,you pay for the game and you pay forever....Can't just play the game by itself....you must keep paying....to keep playing.
4,Nice re-read the day that Cepeda went into the BBHoF,"I saw Orlando Cepeda play throught his career (mostly in person during the time he was with St. Louis). He was my hero then, he is a hero now. The book captures it all. I just wished that its publication could have waited to include a chapter on his 1999 induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame (maybe the paperback will). But with all the times he just missed out on the honor, who can blame the man for writing his story now."
3,typical sports bio,"As is all too typical of the ""as told to"" ghost-written autobiographies, ""Baby Bull"" enables Orlando ""Cha-Cha"" Cepeda the opportunity to vent about incidents in his life in which he believed he was mistreated while being less than completely candid about his own missteps. He seems bewildered about the lack of warmth extended to him by Giants superstar Willie Mays. He skims over the details of his marijuana bust (was it a ""trace"" or 170 lbs. that he was convicted of possessing with intent to distribute). He admits to adultery, but blames it on his Latino heritage and paternal genetics. Despite this, he insists that he has a close bond with his children in their adulthood without detailing much parental involvement in their youth. This said, Herb Fagen's recount of the Hall of Famer's life and career is an easy, enjoyable read, even though the reader is left to fill in the spaces of some of the first baseman's personal troubles."
1,GRADE Z SPOOKER....,"I saw this no-budget wonder as a child and remembered very little. I bought the DVD and now know why. Gloria Talbott finds out she's the title character and freaks out. Boyfriend John Agar tries to help allay her fears but there's a mad killer on the loose in the area and all the evidence points to Gloria. Someone is trying to make her think she's inherited the curse of her father's experiments. The killer sports one of the cheapest make-up jobs you're likely to see in a film of this poor quality. Cheap sets and awful dialogue mark this as a ""quickie"". Talbott and Agar both did their share of low budget horror flicks and they go through the motions as heroine and hero respectively. Ulmer fans may bump this up a couple of notches but it's really a cheap, cheap movie. It's not even very campy. Just dull and really silly."
5,The hippest 1960s brunette around - accept no imitations!,"It is difficult to review this CD without becoming a revolting sycophant, but I will try. Some of the most uplifting songs in the French language are included on this CD - most notably Tous les garcons et les filles. It is a bit depressing to hear the English version of this beautiful song, as the original is much more poetic. The best way to appreciate this song is with a thorough knowledge of French, or, failing that, a French dictionary.One of the most stunning features of this CD is the beautiful photograph of Francoise that has been selected for the cover. This CD comes highly recommended by me and all of those that I have played it for (everybody that I know - over the phone and otherwise).You will fall in love with Francoise. A summer classic, despite the fact that she is pictured with an umbrella on the cover."
4,Frenchy,If you like Claudine Longet you will love Francoise Hardy. Sixties music with sweet and sexy french vocals. Very entertaining and catchy pop.
1,Don't wase your money,You cannot find replacement cartridges for this product at all. Do not buy! Just throw your money out the window instead.
5,C'est incroyable!,"As a French teacher who is always looking for new music to share with students, I am happy to report that this one has become a favorite of my classes. Songs such as A Tatons is particularly requested. We studied the words to the song and listened to it every day for a few weeks. The students are still singing it long after we have moved on to new artists. Axelle Red has such an inviting voice, and of importnace to me, the words are included in the jacket so you can sing along even if you don't speak French."
4,Some of the best French music I've ever heard,"I bought this CD after hearing several of the songs on the radio while working in France. That was several years ago. I still listen to the CD over and over. It has become a main selection in my home. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys foreign artists. I have since purchased several other albums by French artists, but this one is still my favorite."
4,"Axelle, no guns but a lot of roses","Axelle Red is belgian, like me. So I coul not be objective. I simply love this record because of the voice, the music (american ""motown"" musicians) and a lot of charm. It's a record I love to listen in my bed to slowly and happily fall asleep. Axelle, we love you!"
2,A disappointment,"I expected much by previewing tracks on Amazon but the album failed to live up to expectations when played in full. Uninspired and lacking momentum, the album fails to thrill. I can only hope it will grow on me over time."
3,"Are you (candidly, seriously) francophone?","In my opinion, the people who rate this badly really should say in the beginning if they're francophone or not. There are some hit tracks on the CD but some filler tracks too - but - I'm being candid, not arrogant or anything - it's better if you speak French well to appreciate what makes the ""hit tracks"" really hit tracks. ""Rien que d'y penser"" is the best track. But unfortunately it's the sort of track that's really 5-star, but if you don't speak French, the lyrics are lost. It's about meeting someone again after you were once in a really great relationship, but it didn't work out, and there's a vestige of some embers remaining, but only vestiges. Or ""A tatons"": yeah-yaaa... it's about sex, but again, says more if you're francophone.It could be better though - too many filler tracks."
2,What's so great?,"Honestly, I'm not sure what everybody sees in this album. It's not the overall quality or execution of the material that bothers me - her voice is nice enough and the musicianship is also decent. It's just that as I listened to it (and I did give it more than one go), it felt absolutely void of feeling to me. It was a totally unanticipated reaction, because I rarely feel that way about music I hear! What can I say? It sounded and felt flat. Maybe someday I will sample another of her cds and find my view changed."
1,ok,"She has a very good voice to sing. But her songs are not worth listening to. The songs sound horrible. If you want to listen to good french music, go get Vanessa Paradis!"
2,doesn't hold my toddler's interest,"My 16-month-old son will sit still for all his Baby Einstein videos (Neptune, Galileo, Neighborhood Animals, and MacDonald), EXCEPT Baby Monet. After only a few minutes he wanders off to play. This one is definitely geared towards the younger set--not as many concepts or words are introduced as in the other videos. And I wish they'd used more pictures of kids or animals doing different seasonal activities than they used of trees, haystacks (muffins?), and zebras.PS--what is the deal with the Little Einstein promo at the beginning? How stereotypical that the ""leader"" of the pack is a white boy and the ""funny, musical"" kid is the black boy named Quincy. I would have expected more from Disney."
1,Problems with music,"I'm very disappointed with the ""music"" in this DVD and other latest Baby Einstein DVDs. We're supposed to be buying these because it's a wonderful way to play the classical pieces, but Baby Einstein is now introducing pop music, and this is NOT helping our little babies' brains. Why do they have to bring these in?? I have to fast forward these parts. I can't just let my child watch these DVDs without supervision anymore."
2,Disappointing Baby Einstein video,"Although the theme and season footage are great, the overall video lacks three of the things that my son enjoys most about Baby Einstein videos: 1) Fun puppets, 2) Many pictures/scenes of real babies, and 3)Upbeat music. This video is mediocre at best, and we are generally a huge fan of the collection."
3,baby einstein,We are huge fans of baby einstein at our house but this one is just okay. It doesn't seem to keep their attention as much as some of the others.
5,Another good one!,This is a good Baby Einstein DVD-good bonus material on this one too-my son really likes it
2,Lacks the energy of earlier titles; not as engaging for baby,"Having purchased every one of the Baby Einstein DVDs made thus far, we had high hopes for this offering featuring my iwfe's favorite artist. However, our 7-month old son found this particular DVD nowhere near as interesting as he does the others. He woudn't last longer than five minutes before being distracted by anything else he could find in the room, as opposed to rapt attention during Baby Neptune (his favorite), Baby MacDonald, or the big three of Bach, Beethoven and Mozart.Since some folks have mentioned it, I have no problem with the commercial at the beginning, especially since you can just skip to the next chapter/ beginning of the Baby Monet feature. While a big fan of the series, I am disappointed by the reaction from my son, and don't plan on playing this one that often since he didn't seem to enjoy it."
3,"It's ""OK""","This is my least favorite Baby Einstein DVD. I bought it with great anticipation that my 11 month old would enjoy it as he has all of his other DVD's. I found this one to be slow, which is fine is that can keep your baby's attention, but my son watched a couple minutes of this one and started playing. I also was confused by the music at the end - it was very upbeat and fast, but definitely not ""classical"".All of these comments though are just a matter of personal preference, as I think all comments regarding these DVD's are - if your baby likes them, great, but mine just didn't like this newest one."
1,Get ready to be disappointed!,"We have all been waiting for this new DVD from the Baby Einstein group....we were very disappointed! Definitely more for the 6 month group than infants any older or toddlers. Very basic in some ways but then very advanced with lots of stills of Monet works. Very little action compared to Neptune, Noah & Galileo. Anyway, make your own decision but I don't recommend wasting the money. BORING!!!!!"
5,My 1 year old likes it....,"I've read the other reviews, but I disagree. My 1 year old likes this movie. We've got them all, and she likes this one just as much as Baby Neptune (which is her favorite). I guess it just depends on your child. Looking on the up side, if you child doesn't like the movie, you can always try to sell it on ebay! At any rate, my daughter likes this movie and anything she enjoys I write a positive review about. So, good luck!"
2,Painfully slow moving...,"While I appreciate that the concept behind the Baby Einstein product is classical music set to slow moving screen, this one takes the cake!!! We have every dvd in this series and Baby Monet is definitely the worst!!! They show alot of famous pieces of art but I'm not convinced that an infant can appreciate it!!!!!!!! Pass on this one!!!"
4,Good movie...,"My son didn't not even like this movie until he was about 20 months old. Then one day, he just loved it. He loves dancing to the end song with all of the zebras, and just cracks up the whole time. It's a fun movie, but I'd save it until your babies are a little older."
3,Not as good as I thought...,"I was so excited when I saw that Baby Einstein came out with a video titled after my favorite artist. Unfortunately, my daughter wasn't as enthusiastic. She first watched it when she was about nine months old and wasn't into it. I figured she was a little too young so I would wait and try again as she got older. Well, she's now 17 months and just the other day, she climbed off the couch about ten minutes into the DVD. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that maybe she'll eventually like this DVD because I enjoy it, but if not there are other Baby Einstein videos out there she does like."
2,I was disappointed,I have a nineteen month old son and he was bored with this at the first viewing. I thought the DVD would have more Monet paintings (like Baby Van Gogh). Maybe they should have called this Baby Vivaldi. I hate the commercial at the beginning of the DVD as well.
2,Not captivating,"We bought this dvd when my son was just over 3 months old and have played it for him at various ages. In the past 14 months, the video has never once captured his attention as other Baby Einstein titles have. I do not recommend this title."
1,Worst Baby Einstein movie yet. Result of Disney pressure?,"My 6 month old lost interest in the first 5 minutes of this dvd. What happened to the creativity of the earlier videos? Neptune? Numbers nursery?Sure, there are puppets and toys, but it just seems as if they include them in once a segment for the sake of including puppets and toys. No creativity and more stock footage than in a copy of National Geographic.It sure looks a lot like Disney pressure to sell more dvds at any cost."
1,Don't buy it there are better ones!!,I agree with just about everyone else. This video is boring. My daughter will not watch it like she does some of the other videos.
2,"Good advice, but badly outdated at times.","While some of the advice offered by this book was well recieved and noted, much of the book was about writing effective spams (thus rebuking the subtitle, ""Without getting Flamed""). Also, much of the web information was badly out of date; at one point he claims that a mere 15% or web users can view graphics.Say What? Sorry, but ""forget using graphics"" does *not* imply good marketing strategy to me. While I understandthat Vitale was trying to avoid being technical, he wouldhave done well to drop a few web tips like ""forget black-on-grey"".If you want to write spam, buy this book. If you're overly new to the internet and need help with the basic culture,buy this book. If you want to write effective web pages (like I do), do yourself a favor and search ""David Seigel"".His book on third-generation web sites laps this book ineffective web sales."
1,A slow journey into boredom,"I was very excited when a buddy bought this book. We had both heard about what a great writer Bellow's was and the premise was very interesting. Unfortunately this book was one of the few books I had to force myself to finish. (And it isn't even very long!) Turns out we both hated the book and after speaking with some others who also read it discovered that they also thought it missed the mark. Hey, look, we all have different tastes, and that's okay...but if you're going to excite me with the synopsis don't rip me off with character's that could easily solve their problems with a quick call to the police or even a punch in the face. Come on Saul, 3 people from Canada can't be wrong - can we?"
1,Yawn-a-minute,"Trying to broaden my literary horizons, I thought I'd pick up The Victim by Saul Bellow. After all, one of the quotes on the cover proclaimed ""One novel by Bellow is worth a dozen from any other author"". Perhaps true, if those other authors happen to write trade publications for the plumbing industry.The bottom line, it was a festival of boredom. Portnoy's Complaint it's not."
5,Animals are Beautiful People,I have never laughed so hard ever as I did with this movie. A must see!
5,GREAT increase your endorphines by laughing!,This is a super great movie for people of all ages! Absolutely wonderful! I ordered several for my grandchildren and my friends
5,Animals Are Beautiful People,"My family loved this movie ""Animals are Beautiful People."" . It is refreshing to watch a movie without bad language and bad scenes. We would advise anyone with family looking for an excellent film to purchase this one. It arrived sooner than expected, and in perfect condition. very pleased with my order."
5,A masterpiece among nature documentaries.,"I recommend this film for anyone's edification and amusement. It's funny how when I came across the tape in Blockbuster I recognized it from seeing part of it on ABC some fifteen years earlier. It uses the same theme that Aesop, C.S. Lewis, and Beatrix Potter used - that various kinds of animals have various personalities, ones that we see in various people.This music makes excellent use of celebrated musical pieces, such as ""Trepak"" and ""Waltz of the Flowers"" from Tchaikowsky's *Nutcracker Suite*, ""Clair De Lune"" and ""Sunrise"" from Grieg's *Peer Gynt Suite*."
5,Wonderful African Wildlife Video,"If you like - wildlife - music - flowers - beautiful scenery - and humor - you will love this video. (The music and naration enhances the little lizard diging it'self into the sand, and the wild pig backing into its hole SO very funny.) It is expertly done! We loved the way the music is matched up with the antics of the animals and plant's movements. Amazing hard to get photo footage of the critters, and seasons, well nariated, keeps your attention. Educational, with a wide varriety of critters, and plants [who knew there were so many different areas and extreme seasons in the wild regeons of Africa]. Truly a land of extremes, and I live in Alaska, and we have many opposite extremes here. Highly recommended."
5,Still great beautiful people,"Although this movie is very old, it still captures its audience and it can be compare with a lot of movies made recently. The humorous narrator did great and for something this old....it stay a classic!!! i can recommend it."
5,Stunning African Wildlife,"This is a stunning movie of African wildlife in their natural habitat. I saw it as a child and enjoyed it just as much as an adult. It is fascinating if you are 8 or 80. Although old, it has not aged at all. The narrative is extremely well done and very entertaining. I have given this DVD to friends as gifts and without exception they have all loved it."
5,Getting homesick...,"I am from Namibia, where this movie was actually filmed. I was born there, and grew up there.I now live in Detroit, MI. Watching the movie made me homesick.Very good film."
2,Animals on display,"If you enjoy animals you will enjoy this. I was looking for more of a story like with ""The Gods must be Crazy II"". Very clever way to show off animals overall."
2,a manipulated movie- while watching question what is natural,"This movie was very beautiful and funny. The music was well coreographed also. My children and I enjoyed watching it. Never a dull moment. HOWEVER, upon follow up about the Marula fruit trees, we found that the 'intoxification' of the baboons and other animals was man-induced (see wildwatch.com). It is impossible for elephants and baboons to become intoxicated eating this fruit, though people harvest it for this purpose. There is evidence of other manipulation in the movie (the possible burning of a huge bird condominium). I abhore that people would abuse the animals in these or any other ways."
1,DEEPLY OFFENSIVE TO TRUE ANIMAL LOVERS,"I have read all of the reviews of this films, most of which lavished praise on it. It never ceases to amaze me how few people view films critically instead of for pure entertainment.The people who filmed this movie have no respect for animals. If you look at all of the negative reviews, you will see that in fact many of the animals were manipulated for the purposes of entertainment and faux ""education"". Animals made to be inebriated, a massive birds nest burnt down, baby animals thrown into a raging river.If you enjoy going to the circus or rodeo and seeing animals perform with every shred of dignity stolen from them, you will enjoy this movie. Otherwise, stay as far away from it as possible. Someday, it will have historical significance as a documentation of why so many species have gone extinct: man's utter lack of respect for animal life."
1,"Inaccurate, much better choices out there","One's first clue that this is a quite confused video is when the cover of a video of African animals features a tiger. There are no tigers in Africa, except in zoos.Likewise, the scene describing the ""cowardly, lazy, scavenger"" hyenas is incredibly inaccurate.A number of scenes are obviously staged, including the very sad intentional burning of a communal weaver bird nest.On the other hand, there's some good photography, especially of insects, and the cycle of life from dry to rainy seasons. I'd borrow instead of buy this clunker if you insist on seeing it."
2,not a conservationist / nature lover,"I have only contempt for this guy who torches a large old weaver bird colony nest for the sake of this movie. As if a dewdrop could start a fire in this desert, and just when the camera was focussing on it. Shame on you low life!Paul W M, Toronto Canada"
2,animals are beautiful people,"the movie I received was not what I expected, I had seen it on TV years ago and what I got was completely different, the one I saw had giraffes that were drunk with the fruit hippos, or elephants that were drunk, monkeys laying on the ground drunk, it was hillarious and the one that i got from you was not the movie I saw at all, I was very dissapointed, and wish I could find the one that was very funny throughout the movie. Is there a possibility that you know what I'm talking about and maybe I could get the right picture?.."
1,Contrived and abusive of its subject,"Anthropomorphizing at its worst. The animals are ridiculed by a narration that imposes insulting ""human"" scripts onto their actions. Even the clouds are maligned and portrayed as ""armies"". Combine that with the worst musical score you've ever heard, and you have a film that belittles and trivializes the immensity of nature and the lives of non-human animals. It's obvious many of the animals in the movie have been manipulated and deliberately placed in potentially harmful scenarios. I can't believe this won best documentary of the year!! There may be some nice photography here and there and possibly one or two facts, but it's an embarrassing statement about the 'film' makers. It leaves the viewer cold or just plain angry."
1,Nudity and drunkenness are family entertainment???,"Why would anyone want their children (or students) to view a film that puts drunkenness in a humorous light? And for those who may care, the African family in this film has almost nothing on and the mother is bare-breasted (the family is featured for many minutes)."
4,"Just enjoy the film, because it's highly enjoyable","A superb mix of humor and sadess, blended effortlessly into something you'd almost expect National Geographic to put together. It's something the whole family can watch (a few slightly rougher scenes, though, if the children are really sensitive), yet will keep adults entertained too.Was the one scene man-induced? If it was, how do you get elephants, warthogs and baboons to drink the huge quantities of alcoholic beverages necessary to get them that stinko? I think maybe the marula fruit is perhaps more powerful than one self-proclaimed authority site informs us"
5,Nice fan.,"Nice fan, arrived on time and well packaged, fit perfectly and with no drama. Seems to cool about the same as the stock fan."
5,=^oo^=,"Truly, Caitlin Kiernan's hypnotic writing is at it's best in this collection of short stories. I have to say, I have enjoyed everything she's written, but this particular book is perhaps the best of the bunch. Her unusual take on plots works best in the short story format, at least in my opinion. And her prose is so tasty you'll practically want to eat it. She creates stunning, stark imagery, and Richard Kirk's illustrations are a wonderful complement. (More books should be illustrated!) The paperback sadly fell apart though, the cover peeled apart almost immediately."
2,tarantella not so much,"I wanted to like this movie, i really did. It has a wonderful story line and I like mira sorvino as an italinan-american actress. However, with bad lighting, bad audio, cheap film stock and terribly stiff acting this potentially great italian-american movie falls victim to a rock bottom low budget. The location filming is authentically wonderful but blurry and dark. Rose gregorio put forth the most believable of the characters and felt real. it's a good movie to watch once just for the story line if you can force your self to hang with it otherwise not worth bothering with."
4,has many Fortran 77 but not Fortran 95 examples,"This book has many examples of how to parallelize Fortran 77 programs with loops using OpenMP directives, but coverage of how to parallelize Fortran 95 code using array operations is sparse. For this, one should read the tutorial ""Parallel Programming in Fortran 95 using OpenMP"", by Miguel Hermanns, available at the OpenMP web site."
4,Many Tips And Pitfalls,"Hoping for just information on OpenMP, I was pleased to find much information about issues with parallelizing algorithms. In fact, OpenMP itself is actually very tiny, easily fitting on a few quick reference cards. Applying OpenMP, or any multithreading for that matter, is what actually determines success. I was particularly pleased with the section on cache lines and their impact on design."
4,an intimate christmas,It was the first time I ordered something from amazon. I was very satisfied with the result. The cd is very good quality. Only the booklet was torn and the cd-box was broken. That's why i give 4 stars.
3,Tape Hiss is a GOOD THING,"No comment on the recording itself - since I haven't heard it.The best way to offer a old recording is straight - hiss and all. To ""clean up"" a recording - digitally or otherwise - is to harm it - even with today's technology. To remove the hiss is to remove the harmonics - which is what gives a live recording it's liveness."
5,Awesome movie!,"I saw this movie at a festival in Provo and LOVED it! It's hilarious and original. The costume design is so great. You can't beat the centaur costume. It is a great, funny, family friendly movie and I can't wait to get my hands on it. I have to own this movie and have been counting down! :)"
2,Very used!!!!!!!!,You put in ebay his look was good. It's not true. Totally destroyed. Many sheets in the book.Best regardsThanks
3,Boring man,"craftsmanship makes a man a perfect reporter of thoughts?NO it makes a man enthralled by himself.IF this man had any worthwhile thoughts that did not focuus on himself, I did not see themSince this book based on real events,we have leeway to examine real world events and when a man can not find a job when able bodied men are off to war I call him 4 letter words - dull and lazy. As dull as the book.his prose might be exemplary but his account of life shows such a pitiful man who cant interface with real people who perform real tasks, not just those of the mind.The assualt on the neice reflected some satisfying real event for a change, unit lit revelaed his pruriet interest in beating a girl.I hope when he went into the army, he found some of that Physcial labor he was unable to perform before enlistment."
5,About the Bastille ...,"Great book!and now,Gentle Readers:You may have noticed that Amazon made some changes to its website. For more information, view that tube place at /watch?v=PvLilHUaDic.From June 11 - June 17, I, like many other reviewers on Amazon, did not post any reviews and did not make any purchases. This was the only means we have of showing Amazon how much we detest the new reviews format and the overloaded and confusing product pages.Amazon revised the product pages (if one looked very, very closely) to allow public input re the redesign. Now I am told, although I do not yet see it, that the ""improvements"" are being scaled back to a more palatable, user/shopper friendly format.Thanks and Stay Tuned!/TundraVision"
5,Excellent headlight,I purchased this headlight to use for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing at night. It has not disappointed me. The illumination both side to side and ahead of me works well. I am able to be confident on the darkest nights.
2,flicker,First time we've ever written a review but this product deserves a warning. It is not suitable for a marine environment. We use ours on our boat. We have returned ours for repair or replacement three times. After working for about a month the light starts to flicker. If you use it for reading it is unusable.
2,The case of the cracked Case.,"I had one of these when they first came out. It was full of win. It was lite weight. It has different settings for saving batteries. The red filter works nicely. After about two years, when out camping, I found that the case that encloses the batteries had cracked and the lamp no longer functioned.I would buy another one but why should I? I had the last one almost ten years ago and they haven't changed since then. LED technology is everywhere now. Why pay $45 for one of these now when you can find many others for less than $20. Petzl should price these more competitively. If it costs them a lot to make these after all of this time they are doing something wrong."
1,Will not ship to APO,"While this is a fine product, excellent military use in field conditions, it cannot be shipped to an APO in Afghanistan. I'm not quite sure about the logic in not being able to ship to an APO for a serviceman or someone else serving in a warzone. It's a United States zip code, the military will deliver it from there. It's not a sensitive item in any way shape or form and it's a sure bet that those receiving it will not be putting it into the hands of those seeking to do harm with it.Jeez amazon, get a grip and do a reality check here."
5,Fantastic Trail Light,I am impressed! This is just a fantastic light for trail running. It's hard to think about those runs in the wood at night with a flash light. From the first time I used it is was a WOW. It provides ample light to run on the single track trails at night with multiple settings. It is comfortable on the head and easy to adjust or turn on and off. It's opened up a hole new world. PS: My daughter thought is was so cool to go running in the woods at night. It must be good!
4,Very good Product,"Only complaint I have is the batteries fall out sometimes. But if careful, this will not happen."
5,"great for camping, climbing","I've always bought Petzl since my frist headlamp in 2000 and they are the best. This is great for camping , with the red flip-up filter if you're sitting near someone or trying to be polite to other campers. And the different brightness settings are excellent for night-climbing or hiking in the dark. Can't be beat!"
3,"overall good headlamp, red filter needs revision.","overall, this headlamp is designed well and operates well. the only two complaints i have is with the red filter. when the red lens cover is snapped over the white leds, there is a small light gap and not all red light is seen. also, its very challenging to find the tab in which enables you to add/ remove the red lens. if you plan on using this primarily for the red light, i wouldn't recommend this headlamp."
2,Do not get if your plan on getting wet,"I fish the unforgiving rock piles of NJ, pretty much getting wet most of the time with waves crashing over the rocks and getting salt spray in my face. This thing claims to be water resistant, but it is not. After using it one time, the battery terminals corroded and the light is not working properly. If you are planning on being dry the whole time, than its a great lamp. Very light weight, the red lens is perfect for keeping your night vision, its just not good for surf fishing."
1,On-off switch broke,I'm quite disappointed in this light. It worked for a little while but now the on-off switch is defective making it difficult to turn on the light and keep it on. I purchased a Streamlight 61052 Septor LED and love it. I also gave it as a Christmas present to my nephews and brother-in-law.
3,Works as advertised; questionable product quality / durability,"Workded as advertised. However, I was a little dissapointed in the lamp / battery housing as it seemed a little flimsy. I haven't had any problems as of yet (but I have only used a couple times), but wonder about how well it will hold up over the next year"
5,Nice headlamp!,"This is my second Petzl headlamp...I just wasn't getting enough light from my other one for night trail running. This lamp is great. Good power and stays put on your head nicely. I love the adjustability of the beam angle. Haven't had a use for the red lens yet, but it looks cool : )."
5,difference between TacTikka and Tikka,"finally figured out that the difference between the two models is that the TacTikka can be adjusted to project red light (which is useful to preserve night vision when hunting, boating, etc at night), while the cheaper Tikka doesn't have this feature."
5,Reliability,"I took this product with me when I joined Peace Corps and went travelling. It came in helpful multiple times when I was camping and had to go down to the pit toilet and you don't want to have a hand occupied.The multiple brightness settings and red flip down were both extremely helpful and it was extremely good with batteries. Over two years of use I didn't need to replace the batteries, although I carried extras. Part of that was using the lowest setting, which still would give plenty of light to see ahead of you on dark trails. It was the right size to toss in the pack on the way out and was almost always one of the first things I would make sure to get out when it would get dark."
3,Not to pleased,"I previously have been using thePetzl E89 PD Tactikka XP Headlamp, Desertand have loved it.I purchased thePetzl E49P TacTikka Plus 4-LED Headlamp, Blackhoping it would be as good, but the cover for the red lens is very hard to grab ahold of.Also there was a spot in the center of the light that had a different color temperature. It got very annoying so I sent it back. Not sure if that was a problem with the light or if they all are like that."
4,Great product.,"This is a great light. It has a wide beam that is very nice for hiking or under the hood. Great battery life. I would have given it 5 stars if it had two focus options like the original Tikka that I like and have had for years. The wide beam reaches the same distance of the original, just slightly dimmer."
1,Not a good deal,"This thing costs twice as much as the Energizer 7 LED headlamp which has 45 lumens, this one only has 35 lumens, you do the math. The energizer one is slightly more bulky (maybe 20% bigger), but that's a small inconvenience for a much better deal."
5,great light,This light is still working great. love the ability to adjust the brightness. the red cover works well when you do not want to lose your night vision or wake someone else up in your tent.
5,A suitable replacement for a Tikka,"I purchased this after loosing my old Tikka a few weeks back. The red lense worked great for hunting season, sneaking into my stand early AM and allowing me not to make too much noise. Another winner from Petzl!"
2,Weak Case,"Case cracked on it after perhaps 10 backpack trips.Still using it, applied some duct tape.My previous Petzl case also cracked. Won't be buying another."
4,Great for power outage,I purchased this specifically for power outages. It works great and leaves my hands free from holding a flash light or lantern. I can even read with it. I have also used it for working in spaces with little light. I highly recommend this product.
3,Cyrano,"Not as good as I thought. Also, I found out I don't care for foreign movies with subtitles so much."
5,a vision of romance and tragedy,"it has taken some time for this release and it was worth the wait. i first saw this at the movies and now, seeing it again, brings back the memory of romance and tragedy, the beauty and the beast plot and all. it may be in french, but the translation is pretty sufficient and accurate that you not only understand the beautiful poetry that cyrano sprouts, but also the passion that flows with it.gerard depardieu is fabulous in his role and he clearly made it his movie. the other supporting roles work well too, and it all adds up to make this a feast for the eyes and emotions. i totally recommend this dvd. it's what true love is all about!"
4,Great buy,"I won't review the movie itself because this is not the place.The product itself is very good. Some say the image is streched. Yes it is. Does it bothers? After 15 min : no. That is the only down side I have. This movie is pretty old and all I wanted is to have a copy of it since my VHS doesn't work. You HAVE to expect some grain in the movie. Also, this product is rare and its price was really great (I've seen some at 100$+).If you liked this movie, buy this version, you won't be disapointed.Summary : Only cons is the stretching that you won,t see after 15min and maybe the grain in the movie. - 1 star."
4,Wonderfully Sad Romance,Great flic for the chics that want lots of laughs as well as a good cry. I love this movie and watch it a few times a year. The cast is fabulous.
