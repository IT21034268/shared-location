3,Kids Liked it a Lot (But It's the Worst Scooby Movie I've Seen),"My kids went through a phase when they wanted to watch this movie over and over and over. Thankfully, it only lasted about three weeks, because this is a rather sappy, hokey and unwatchable (for adults) Scooby movie. I grew up on the ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" episodes. I loved them then, and I still like to watch them with my kids now. But this 1980s retread of the Scooby adventures doesn't hold a candle to the 1970s era shows (or even the more recent ""Scooby-Doo, Mystery Incorporated"" series). The ""...Reluctant Werewolf"" is relentlessly boring and drags on for far too long. Very silly antics and gags. At the end of the day, if the kids like it, the movie serves its overall purpose. But you'll probably have a hard time watching it with them. If they absolutely must have this one, plan an activity in another room!"
2,"I love Scooby-Doo, but this is a stinker","Ugh. This is such a boring ""movie."" There is no fake ghost/monster for the mystery crew to find. In fact, no Fred, Velma or Daphne! Just Scooby, Shaggy and (yuck) Scrappy. This movie drags on and on. My 3 year old was bored (that is not saying much), but so was I. The best thing I can say about this movie is that Shaggy makes an adorable werewolf. Very cute. Otherwise, no good plot, no meddling kids, no surprise. A real disappointment. Look elsewhere for your Scooby fix!"
5,Scooby Doo and the Reluctant werewolf,Another Scooby Doo that my kids like a lot of my kids love scooby doo. Two of them even did there rooms in scooby doo.
4,Without men,Delightfully comic and beautifully filmed.A subject little known in our country.Eva longoria is as charming as can be.
2,bad,"I really dont like this movie!!!! Bad english spoken, actress dissapionted....It is a very bad spanglish movie that i even not go to the end..."
3,Great for the price,"However, if you're like me and really only enjoy simple arcade games, then you'll get a little bored with the limited selection of games. But this is exactly the game I used to play on my first play station. It's pretty great. ESPECIALLY Toy Pop! You can play that game for HOURS!"
4,Great fun!,"This collection of old classic arcade games is pretty darn fun. Toy Pop and Pac-Man are my personal favorites! If you like games like these, then definitely try this out! I for one have lots of fun with it, especially with friends! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,Classic,Ahhhhh.. nothing like the classic old school. The museum is a good addition to the gameplay.P.S: The games options can be changed like adding more lives to Pac-Man.
4,play Pac Man again !,"I bought this as a Christmas present for a friend of mine.He is a Pac Man fan, and since this game is featured in the disk i decided to buy it. He is ussing the PS2 to play this game and so far i haven't heard any complains from him regarding the disk."
3,Namco Pacman ROCKS!,"I'm a Pacman fanatic, so I was pretty excited about this. It works in the Playstation 3 system, which is nice. The only problem is that you have to use the keypad. You can't use the joystick. Oh well..."
5,Handy Flashlight to have on hand,"Flashlights (2) works fine. No problem.MAGLITE M2A036 Hang Pack Mini AA Flashlight, Red"
2,Good and Bad,Subject matter is good if you can read it. Extremely poor scan of original book published in 1952. Have only read the first few chapters and it is almost unbearable.
2,DVD Sound Quality Poor; Movies Boring,"The Matrix is a classic film and I've owned the DVD for many years. When I saw the combo DVD Matrix Reloaded / Revolutions was at a good price, I decided to take the plunge. Compared to the original Matrix movie, these sequels are a disappointment - too long, convoluted script and sometimes ridiculous dialog, wooden acting, etc., but to make things worse, the sound quality on this DVD is very poor. We had to have the sound on the TV turned all the way up to hear the dialog, and then had to quickly turn down the volume for the action scenes. I don't have this problem with other DVDs. I'd say skip this purchase."
4,The Matrix series,My son is 11 and had never watched the Matrix. So I purchased the 1st movie from Amazon as a Christmas gift. He liked that one sooo much that I decided to purchase the two sequels. We watched the first sequel last Friday and he loved that one as well! Tonight we'll watch the 2nd one. movie.
5,MATRIX DVD,This is an outstanding deal. Imagine getting two Matrix DVDs for one remarkable low price. highly recommend to anyone who enjoys the Matrix series.
4,A good DVD,This is a Matrix DVD what more can I say. If you get one you just have to get the other. Sort of like a long running winded book. You just have to see the next sequel.
4,Just for clarification,In case you're wondering - these movies do not come in separate cases. Both discs are in the same box.Didn't bother me one bit. I'm happy with the purchase.
3,2 Beat Movies in One...,"...but the low price and single size blu-ray small packaging almost make it worth having. A wrap-up to what was an extraordiary, ground-breaking flick that should have been left alone in the wake of these."
1,Hugely irritating,Its like going to a loud classical music concert with an English guy and a Chinese woman shouting random words at you!I can't imagine anything more counter conducive to learning.Presumably they imagined that they should add some value to just two people spouting words but I would have been happy to purchase just that! If I wanted to listen to loud classical music at the same time - I'll play it myself.
1,would never have thought anything could be this awful,"I will keep it simple. They have classical music playing on the audio. Not background classical music. Loud classical music! It seems just as loud, perhaps louder than the speakers. It is very difficult to catch the subtle tone inflections of the speaker. Have you ever tried to talk to someone with loud music playing in the background? You always ask them to turn it down so you can understand them right? And that is when they are speaking the same language that your are! How the producer(s) of the Chinese VocabuLearn could think this is was a good idea, it just goes beyond my understanding. It is so beyond rediculous, I will term this as Meta-rediculous."
2,Capacity not as good as Earthwise,"Got this cartridge on Amazon because the Imation Earthwise cartridge wasn't available. In 6 weeks, this toner is out and only printed about 5400 pages. Going back to the Imation Earthwise cartridge even though I can't get it using Amazon Prime. Basically two of the Verbatims will equal an OEM HP c8061x for the same total cost."
1,So very wearisome..,"IN RESPONSE TO THE CONTENT:I'm forty-one. The Daffy cartoons that my friends and I loved best were the early Freleng and Clampett ones, not this super-late, flavorless junk. I've never known anyone who liked the ""mean"", scheming, formulaic Daffy.After sleep-overs my friends and I would groan Saturday mornings about this stuff and cheer when the early and funny ones came on. Often we could tell just by the opening whether it was time to change the channel for ten minutes or not.It's horribly tiresome that whenever Daffy appears on dvd in the last ten years the majority of the discs are crammed with this late material and not the work 1937-1946.I won't be purchasing this one but I hope Warners will collect the early best of America's second favorite duck on a future volume."
1,"Where's ""Daffy's Southern Exposure""?","Still waiting for WB to release classics like ""Daffy's Southern Exposure"" and ""The Hen-pecked Duck."""
1,Why doesn't Warner Bros want my money?,"The only reason that I will not be buying ""Daffy Duck: Frustrated Fowl,"" and the only reason for my 1-star rating, is because someone at Warner Bros decided to use matting to cover up the tops and bottoms of most of the cartoons on this DVD.For example, in the original version of ""Design For Leaving,"" Elmer Fudd is shown sitting on a bus, and we can see his face through the bus's window. But on this DVD, we can only see his mouth and the bottom of his nose.Warner Bros claims that their reason for doing this is because that's what the artists originally intended. I very much doubt this claim. Why would they draw Elmer's face if they never intended for anyone to be able to see it? Furthermore, none of the cartoons on the six Looney Tunes Golden Collections are matted, and no one ever complained about the fact that those cartoons weren't matted.I bought all six Golden Collections. But I will not be buying ""Frustrated Fowl."""
1,Send your complaints to Warner Home Video,"For those of you who are unhappy with the fake widescreen format on the cartoons, here is a customer service number for Warner Home Entertainment. This is a voice mail set up specifically for consumer feedback on their DVD product:818-977-6065Be polite yet firm. Make sure to suggest the idea of a disc replacement program."
1,Cropping ruins toons,"Yeah, there are WB apologists out there who are just happy more Looney Tunes have been released on DVD. Yeah, there are some toon fans out there who say cropping does not bother them.But cropping two-thirds of the cartoons on this set was a completely unnecessary thing to do. I really don't understand the mentality that was behind this decision. Just who is WB catering to by ruining these cartoons like this?"
1,"Cartoons and customer not respected, not worth the money","As said before most of the cartoons of this set are cropped and tampered with. The top and bottom of the shorts have been cut to adapt them to widescreen format. This makes them unwatchable as bits of the action and animation are missing, the image looks cropped and you keep concentrating on the missing parts. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE viewing. Plus I must say the image restauration doesn't look as pristine as the Golden collection series.What is more unsettling is that Warner Bros keeps doing this all over again, tampering with content (censorship, cropping...) showing no respect at all for intellectual property but most of all no respect whatsoever for the customer. It is disgusting.Sadly I can't recommend the buying of this product and its sister : the Bugs Bunny superstar. The viewing is really uncomfortable, and the fan and collector is not respected by Warner. The product is not worth the money it cost."
2,What an incredible letdown for Looney Tunes fans.,"Mandatory, inappropriate widescreen. No extras. No care taken in menus or presentation. Something has come off the rails at Warner. That's OK, I'll wait until someone else is in charge and decides to do the right thing and continue proper restorations. Until then, if you were a fan of the Golden Collections, don't bother with these, they are a travesty."
1,What were they thinking?????,"I had this and the Bugs Bunny disc on my wish list, but not any more. I will not be buying them. Cropping the image is disrespectful to the original work and shows no sense of respect to all of us die hard fans. Did WB really think that cropping the image would be a selling point? Let's face it, the majority of the audience for these are going to be older folks who are familiar with the originals. It boggles the mind! What were they thinking?!?!?!?!?!?"
1,amazing shorts... aweful treatment,"I own the entire Looney Tunes Golden Collection and I absolutely love it. Between the release of these six box sets and the release of these two new DVDs, Hare Extraordinare and Frustrated Fowl, something baaaad happened in Warner Brother's lab. These DVDs seem to have been sent in a food processor and 10 out of 15 of those shorts were ""formatted to fit a widescreen TV"".For most of those widescreen shorts, I find them very annoying to watch, there is so much missing on the frame. I am not going to buy any further Looney Tunes if they get the same treatment.I really, really hope Warner Brothers will soon be releasing a replacement disc, unformatted. If enough people complain to WB's customer service, maybe that will happen. Why not give it a try by sending them an email :[...]"
1,"""Despicable"" DVD","""Daffy Duck: Frustrated Fowl"" was slapped together for the purpose of making a fast buck. Artistic integrity and quality control take a back seat to Warner Home Video's cynical attitude: ""You want new-to-DVD animation? We'll give you some of Daffy's worst cartoons and twist the blade by cropping the post-1953 theatrical ratios."" I'm surprised Warner didn't tamper with the soundtracks in the same fashion as its ""Max Fleischer's Superman"" DVD set. ""Tick Tock Tuckered"" (1944), ""Nasty Quacks"" (1945) and ""Daffy Dilly"" (1948) do not justify the purchase of this ""despicable"" release. A better title would have been ""Daffy Duck for Suckers."""
2,Coby MP-C759 MP3 Player 2.5 inch display,"Music Player module is great. ONE FATAL FLAW--conversion software does not work. I purchased this player for the large 2.5 inch display but cannot receive full benefit if videos cannot be converted with included software. When software is downloaded 30 day trial says 0-days left, option offered to ""purchase"" software. $100+ a lot to pay for mp3 with 2.5 display."
5,Best all-around sunglasses I have ever used,"I have owned a pair of these ""Fits Over Solar Shields - Copper"" sunglasses for several years. I find them to be quite durable and very protective. I use them when working in the yard and while driving, or at any time I am outdoors in bright sunshine.The complete coverage eliminates side glare and stray reflections. The copper color is particularly helpful when driving, because it makes things stand out distinctly against any background, even in hazy, overcast conditions. This is a tip pilots have known about for many years.The large size may bother some people, but they make it possible for me to wear my regular glasses underneath when needed. This is a valuable feature that should be tried by potential buyers before rejection."
4,Great report for a great project.,"I enjoyed ""Decade of the Wolf"" both for the information given on the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone as for the manner in which it is written. The first-person delivery of the tale is quite engaging and readable. However I would have liked to see more hard data, especially on the dramatic changes brought to Yellowstone ecosystems as a result of the reintroduction of the wolf."
5,A remarkable decade indeed,"This is an engaging and informed account of perhaps the most important environmental story in recent years, the successful reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park. The authors have been involved in this project from the ground up, and it shows. They provide an impressive amount of information but even more important, they use some fascinating stories to convey the behavior of these remarkable animals. I've been fortunate enough to see the Yellowstone wolves, but when I see them the next time, it will be in a new light."
1,False quotations discredit fascinating account,"Having just read another biography of Truman, I was reminded of Plain Speaking and of the newspaper articles a year or two ago which discredited this book. An historian actually checked out some of the most colorful quotations attributed to Truman by Miller and found Miller had either altered the real Truman statements or dressed them up to make them more colorful. The historian listened to Miller's own tapes - which are, as I recall, at the Truman Presidential library - and was astonished at what he found. He had no agenda to discredit Miller; he had initally simply wanted to hear Truman's voice making the statements and to also gather fuller context. So, while most of what Miller recorded is accurate, the intellectual dishonesty of manufacturing quotes is unforgiveable."
3,"entertaining historical fiction, but not history","I found this quite entertaining and enjoyable and i recommend it as such. Unfortunately it is presented as an accurate account of real interviews, but there is no reason at all to believe this is true, and some research to show it is not. Still, this fictional account does resemble the real Truman and you may wish to believe it. As I recall, these doubts have been prevalent ever since it was published in 1974."
4,A good look at an interesting man,This was my introduction to HST and his role in history. It was also when I figured out that he saved me personally. In that my Father joined the Army in 1946 so if Harry had not dropped the big one on Japan. Then you probadly would not be reading this right now. Enough said
4,"Coded ""True Man"" for simple Database Alignment",Harry S Truman was the signal for the NarcoticsTerrorist Racist Gay & Entertainment Community led by the nose from IndiaPakistani Traitors to push War and Economic Terrorism EXPLICITLY AntiWorldPeace.
4,"Tell Me, Mister President, What Did You Really Think About MacArthur and Ike? #$%@&*!","This is a damn funny book. I hope someone preserved the original tapes.Merle Miller interviewed former President Harry S. Truman and the transcripts of those sessions formed the basis for this book. Truman minces no words and is mildly profane when discussing various subjects. Tell me, Mister President, what did you really think of Douglas MacArthur and Dwight Eisenhower?In their own small way, books such as this helped rehabilitate the reputation of Truman. At the conclusion of his presidency, he was not especially popular with the public or the leaders of the Democratic Party. On the whole, Truman tried to do his best and that ought to count for something. He made his share of mistakes, but it is not easy to wrestle with the venal politicians who run Washington."
2,Disappointed,"While this product seemed to work with Windows 2000, It did not work consistently with the Windows XP that was on my laptop. As a result of all the finger pointing between HP, Microsoft, and Belkin techies (most somewhere in India) I abandoned my efforts to parrallel a desktop and a laptop into the new HP 1020 printer. I now have to switch input cables manually for print jobs. Very disappointed.Returned unit for full credit - no questions asked. (The only good part of the transaction)"
4,doesn't come with a cable,"I expected it would come with a cable to hook up to the USB device, but it doesn't. So I am ordering a third cable...."
1,multifunction printer users beware,"compusa salesman handed me the 2x1 switch after I told him that my printer is a multifunction, saying it was compatible. guess what - it is NOT. the one time I didn't keep the packaging - they won't take it back. the unit actually works fine as long as I manually switch computer cables. which defeats the whole point of a switcher."
5,Excellent,"Excellent book and very easy to follow. A must for any first time user, or anyone who is upgrading."
2,"Depression ""On the Line""","Multiple fictional short stories based on composite real life people written by a known communist. All characters are on a Ford production line in the 50's, hate their job, have no real friends at work or off, have dysfunctional marriages,no joy in life. A really gray depressing existence. The author's use of hyperbole to show what a terrible life it is to be ""On the Line"" comes across as communist propaganda. I had to read this for a masters history course. If you don't have to buy this don't, unless you like being depressed by your reading."
1,HAHAHAHAHA,"I fell asleep...but i am SO SORRY that i did. This was the most hilarious piece of crap. The only talent anyone appeared to have is mopping the floor (and even that was done poorly). Horrible, HORRIBLE movie. Its one of those things where the first 20 minutes are filled with ""what the heck?"" the next 20 are filled with laughter and more ""what the heck?"", and the remaining time is filled with snoring. I am so so very sorry i paid a dollar to watch this thing. I can't even begin to imagine the types of favors people had to do to even get this on DVD, let alone in the redbox-which is where i rented it. THANK HEAVEN i didn't purchase it."
1,Are You Kidding Me?!?,"Are you kidding me? This movie is horrible! First of all, it does not even have a plot and the acting is terrible! Please don't even waste your time or money renting or buying this movie. You will be totally lost on where the ""hustler"" part comes in until the end. It just doesn't make any sense at all! A positive note is that it does have a catchy title, but they should have put more effort and creativity into the film."
3,Holy Hustler 2?,This movie has great potential. I enjoyed it! The plot was ok but the acting was phenomenal! eagerly awaiting the sequel and hoping its more action packed.
5,Healing Music.,"Sandi's vocals on this album are simply ethereal! This, combined with lyrics which reflect life's transitions and the heart-warming rythmical ecoustic texture she has produced, is truly a combination that only a master can achieve. This is positively music to heal the soul."
3,Definitely not my favorite.,"If you really like a challenge this is the puzzle for you. I have been working on it forever and don't have much done. I love a challenge and can usually whip out a puzzle in no time, but this one has me pulling my hair out. The picture came out blurry when blown up to puzzle size, which makes it impossible to figure out what area the piece might go in.. being black and white makes it even tougher.On a good note, the puzzle pieces are thick and fit together well... if you can figure out which two pieces go together. While the puzzle looks cute, I don't recommend this one to anyone that gets frustrated easily."
5,Full of insights!,This book covers both the application of ayurveda therapies on the physical body and the mind. A must read for anyone interested in ayurveda as a holistic therapy.
5,I devour thrillers and this one is the BEST this year !,"The Fifth Internationale is a fascinating roller coaster ride through deception and conspiracy in the very institutions and pinnacles of power that are the foundations of our, so called ""free"" or ""democratic"" world. Excellent pace, and hard to put down thriller! Read it in under two days! The twists will keep you guessing till the last paragraphs. Loved the setting, a true eye opener on the mysterious and often scary world of post-cold-war Eastern Europe, where corruption and organized crime run out of control. Can't wait for King's next novel!"
1,Deamland,This without a doubt the most convoluted attempt at writing I've seen. I doubt the author remembered from chapter to chapter what he wrote. I got this book at a garage sale for a dime and that was too much.
4,"Great Book, watch the little hands","The reason books like this one are so great are the moving parts that entertain kids so much. However, it is also their downfall as they rip easily when used by little hands. You have to be vigilant in making sure they are careful or the book will rip to shreds very quiclky.Not recommended for rougher children, unless you plan to keep it out of reach and only read it with them. However, it is a beautiful book with great illustrations and good presenation of opposites."
5,"An excellent, engaging ""opposites"" book","This is a very fun, creative opposites book with flip ups, twists, pull flaps, etc. Very colorful, well-depicted, and engaging--a great book!"
1,Average qigong book but poor zhineng qigong book,Many misleading parts which are definitely not based on the original teachings of Pang Ming
5,Splendid,Just returned from Costa Rica and this CD instantly takes you back to the great sounds of a great place! Close your eyes and you will be transformed to the wonderful sites and sounds of Costa Rica!
3,It's okay,"This CD is a great CD if you want seperate pieces of nature. The sounds are not blended together in a composition. There is a track for volcanic mud, a seperate one for something else etc. Nothing is blended together. That is what I didn't like. The sounds themselves are cool though."
1,"Awful, unless you like rap","I got this thinking it'd contain easy listening love ballads like ""Wherever you go"". However, the songs are harsh rap / hip-hop style. Perhaps some may like it, but I found the lyrics and melodies unpleasant. Not recommended."
3,90 Rap,"I was looking for this CD, as a collector's item.I owned the cassette versión but after 20 years, it finally broke up, I repair it twice, buy now I decided to buy the CD... : D, now I am as happy as I was back in 1993 :D.The product has some scratches, the cd case was broken, it has a spot of glue on it. in spite of all of that, the cd plays well."
2,B - kung fu movie,"Picture was very grainy. Acting wasn't great.Story was decent but lacked quality due to bad actors.For an old movie was okay, would be considered a flop by todays standards."
3,More on President Clinton,"This is an interesting documentary on the Presidency of Clinton. Worth watching, but probably not something you will watch over and over."
2,Good cause - So-so movie,"Saw a DVD screener and although I agree completely with the movie's politics, it really is not a very well made movie.The use of archival footage from old police movies and westerns is really pretty poorly done. I guess it's designed to interject a little motion and a snarky attitude.Good interviews with Susan McDougal and various folks from Arkansas. A good review of alot of what happened but not terribly complete with the whole story.This movie makes you realize how talented Michael Moore is."
2,"Good cause, bad movie.","The content is good, Susan McDougal is a hero. Some good footage but this is a poorly made movie with campy ganster movie footage and stuff from old westerns spliced in to mock and provide a little movement.Its good to recount the whole whitewater thing but so much is left out. Connections and personalities are missing. This movie will really make you understand how good of a filmmaker Michael Moore really is."
3,A warning for us all,"This film nicely points out how Robert Scaiffe, with a few million dollars and unsupervised groups of political haters, could skew an ethics-challenged press into unfair coverage of a President.I can't wait to see the sequel: How George Soros, with a lot of money and unsupervised groups of political haters have spent over $500 million to skew an ethics-challenged press into unfair coverage of a President."
4,A WELL DONE DISCLOSURE OF POLITICS FOR WHAT THEY ARE,"I am an independent, and this film gives an in-depth look at the campaign by the Republican right to destruct the Clinton presidency. Now any story is going to be told through a particular perspective, and this one is no different. But pro-Clinton does not necessitate it as propeganda, all films have an agenda. Overall, it is informative, cohesive, and eye-opening. I am generally disillusioned by the majority of political culture and this film illuminates the grim reality of how distorted the priorities of the powers-that-be can become."
2,A waste of time,"You know, there's a good movie in here somewhere about this subject. Sadly, this isn't it.""The Hunting of the President"" is boring, confusing and tries to fit way to much information into ninty minutes. I hadn't read the book, but that shouldn't be essential in watching the movie.This movie jumps from point to point so quickly that you have little to know time to digest all the information being thrown at you. And after a while, you really won't care.The one thing I did really like is that knowing Little Rock AR pretty well, it was really cool to see spots that I have been too in a movie. But you really shouldn't notice these things if the story being told is at all interesting.""The Hunting of the President"", though it brings up some goond and interesting points despite itself, isn't really worth watching."
1,No conspiracy necessary to discredit Clinton.,"It just amazes me how libs either revise or omit facts when telling a story. Clinton lied. He used his office to get others to lie. The two people caught up in that drama that were telling the truth(Starr and Tripp) were savaged. Clinton fixed a court case in order to deny his accuser a fair trial and these umphs make a movie to garner sympathy for the slick one. More amazing is how many people will swallow this one as easy as they swallowed Farenheit. Same as they will swallow Rather's precious memos. ""We will accept it if it says what we want to believe"" Shakespeare saw the American left coming years ago."
4,wow i didnt know some of this stuff,"Well,after watching this DVD, I found that I didn't really know a lot about whitewater. I thought it was really interesting to watch no matter what your party affiliation is. A lot of great interviews, including James Carville, Paul Begala and Susan McDougal. A very good explanation of whitewater, especially if you have little or no knowledge of the scandal like myself. In addition to whitewater, they also give some sex scandal stuff. Talks a bit about Paula Jones in the beginning and later leads into Monica Lewinsky. No actual interview with President Clinton, but there is a special feature on the disc where you can watch President Clinton's reaction and his speech from the premiere. He speaks for a while about the key players involved and gives his thoughts."
3,Buy it for Clinton's speech at the premiere,"I enjoyed the movie. However, it wasn't near as in-depth as I would have liked. Additionally, the ""humorous"" film clips from the past took away more from the picture than they added.The transfer, by the way, is a good one. The anamorphic picture is very good throughout (excepting the old film clips).It really wasn't until I watched Clinton's speech at the movie premiere (one of the special features), that I concluded the DVD had, indeed, been a worthwhile purchase.Oh, Bill....why did you have to go? This country needs your leadership now more than ever."
4,The Lenghts that some people go to...,"smear the name of a prominent individual, in this case, Former President of the United States William J. Clinton. IT'S A FACT, HE DID IT, HE LIED ABOUT IT TOO! But who cares, there are preist, our allegedly most trusted and holy people in our lives that do much worse and get a slap on the wrist. To think that millions, 65 million exactly, was spent on trying to undo Bill Clinton's presidency. The film was slow to start and after the introductory 15 minutes, accelerated to a steady, pulse raising pace filled with information, insight and intrique that only a democrat could love...I am an independently registered voter. The film was well directed and wonderfully coherent."
2,Not Worth Buying,"I am a big fan of Saul Williams poetry, and I bought this CD after I heard an MP3 containing some of the lyrics from ""Said the Shotgun to the Head."" Unfortunately, there are only two tracks that make use of William's poetry on this album. The rest of the albums tracks are made up of a couple of pretty boring and predictable political rants. Not that I don't agree with the politics, but as far as music goes, these tracks don't do much for me. Then there are a bunch of remixes... well if I didn't think the original was any good, you can guess what I think of a bunch of remixes."
3,Lego Drive,"Flimsy and not worth the money. Kept it, but shouldn't have. Would not recommend, must be a better similar product out there."
2,Meh,"I really wanted this album to be brilliant. Instead it's just simply ""okay"". It's hard to tell what Andy was shooting for - gone are the straight-up simple beat-heavy tracks of his last album - and gone are the harsher sounds of his earlier work. It's like he couldn't decide if he wanted to be more hardcore or more mainstream so instead he ends up being neither. I so badly want this album to kill on the dance floor but I'm afraid the best it's going to do is fade unceremoniously. Meh."
1,ex combichrist fan,"andy used to make good music.the ""get your body beat"" single made me hopeful, even if it was a new direction. sadly, this cd contains some of the worst of the genre. it's unlistenable, not due to cheesy profanity or 'heaviness', but laughably bad quality.this album is utter trash, from the first to the tenth listen through."
4,It's not 'Everybody Hates You'...,"I've only listened to this CD once so far, but I listened to it all the way through. It may take a while to grow on me, as it seems to be a step down from 'Everybody Hates You', which is brilliant. However, the album isn't terrible. It's full of offensive lyrics (what little there are, anyway), that trademark Combichrist thumping beat, and a growling Andy LaPlegua. I imagine the material would be fantastic live, but I'm just not feeling it. Yet."
2,Poor attempted mirror of The Prodigy.,"A friend of mine introduced me the this band and I like a couple songs but they remind me too much of The Prodigy. Yeah, the lyrics may be different but there is nothing unique about Combichrist. I had to turn this album off is was so boring and lame."
4,Andy is Watching You,"I was excited when this came out and wasn't dissapointed. It's not in the same league as ""Everybody Hates You"", mostly because I don't think CombiChrist will ever top the songs ""God Bless"", ""Happy Fcuking Birthday"", and ""This Is My Rifle"". That being said, this album is very tongue in cheek and still full of awesome sound. It kinda makes you want to crush something just because you can. andy has no illusions about being anything other than what he is, 1/3 of the most crushing EBM band in recent history."
3,"solid collection, somewhat simple","Sheet music for 23 B&D songs. Piano arrangements are on the simple side, guitar chords are adequate (doesn't overdo it by attempting to follow every voicing in the piano part -- but does do this to some extent). Song selection: generally good, with a few odd choices (where's ""What's New Pussycat""?): Alfie, Always Something There to Remind Me, Anyone Who Had a Heart, April Fools, Close to You, Do You Know the Way to San Jose, Don't Make Me Over, House is Not a Home, I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself, I Say a Little Prayer, I'll Never Fall in Love Again, Look of Love, Magic Moments, Make It Easy on Yourself, Message to Michael, One Less Bell to Answer, Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head, This Guy's in Love with You, Trains and Boats and Planes, Walk on By, What the World Needs Now is Love, Wishin' and Hopin', Wives and Lovers."
4,Documentation for Eucharist,This is a text book on the complete historyof the theology of the Blessed Sacrament.Very well written. To be read as informationalnot in usual sense as spiritual reading
3,"10 out of 10 for content, 3 out of 10 for style.","Readers of the true crime genre might like Sherlock's style, but most people will find him a bit too in-your-face for their taste. This is a shame, because The Scarlet Survey is a no-holds-barred look at the seamy underside of American abortion practice. Sherlock peers under every rock, and describes with gleeful loathing whatever he finds crawling there -- and there is indeed vermin galore. His sources are excellent and carefully cited. The Scarlet Survey is an eye-opener, and worth the read if you can get past the tone."

4,This book is a must if you enjoy creating beautiful table settings.,"I have always loved to create different napkin folds for my table when entertaining, and my guests always comment on them. David Stark creates some beautiful and fun folds. I got so many ideas for napkins and also for table settings. This book is beautiful to look at, and it also has some famous folds from the White House and other celebrated places. If you love to entertain, this is for you. The instructions are very easy to follow and the folding is fast."
4,Wonderful book for creative people.,"I bought this book for my very creative fourteen year old daughter as a Christmas gift. She spent most of the morning trying all the folds and then had the table set with a variation of a couple of examples from the book for our family dinner. She had no problem duplicating the folds, the only drawback is I am now searching for another good napkin folding book for her, she is hooked."
5,Love this book!,I keep this book on the shelf with my linen napkins. The phots are beautiful and I find the directions to be easy to follow.
4,Step by step instructions are great!,"I enjoyed this book and the photographs. It was helpful that each step of the folding process is shown. My only qualm is that the space devoted to the history of the folds could have been used to just add more folding patterns. I had to go online to find a heart fold for Valentine's Day, when I was hoping the book had that fold. I used another fold from the book instead though, and my table was beautiful anyway."
5,Fascinating book,"It was just what I was looking for, for a Christmas present for my niece. I do not have a tatoo but I found the book extremely interesting; as I read through several parts before wrapping it up and sending it to her."
5,A great gift for a tattoo aficionado,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my father, who has recently come to appreciate the art of tattoos. He absolutely loves it! This is the perfect gift for a tattoo aficionado. The book is a well written, well researched, and extensively illustrated catalog of the history and evolution of the art form."
3,A rewarding simplification,"Birnbaum provides an interesting analysis of educational institutions between 1960 and 2000 groping for silver bullets to salve perceived failures and save their positions of influence. The book is worth reading to understand something of the nature of education institutions' political climate. Birnbaum's premise is well stated and discussed admirably, not withstanding some simplification to accomplish this in under 300 pages. His writing style is quite readable, as always."
2,Not nearly worth the price..,"""The King is Dead"" is a good song, as with any other Charon song. However, one track does not make $11.99 an acceptable price. You get ""Religious/Delicious"" on ""The Dying Daylights"" full length CD.At least if there would have been an included music video or something, it may have been worth the effort of buying. But one song does not a CD make...."
4,The best part is the stories,"A great book that I lend to every pregnant woman I know. I felt that the strong point in this book is the detailed stories and experiences told ""in their own words"" by a number of couples who have birthed their babies together at home. I especially liked reading the accounts given by fathers, as most birth stories are written by mothers -- perhaps understandably, but it is lovely to see the other side!I don't think this is the only resource one should have on unassisted childbirth -- I like to recommend Laura Shanley's <i>Unassisted Childbirth</i> and, for those who really feel they need a how-to of some kind, Gregory J. White's <i>Emergency Childbirth: A Manual</i>, which should dispel some fears. Armed with these three books and a couple of internet searches, anyone should be ready to make a truly informed decision about this choice -- which so few are aware is even a valid option. Kudos to Ms. Griesemer for making these stories public to anyone."
2,I really tried to like this book but...,"This author had a very strong bias due to living in a state without a strong midwife system. All the points she made against midwifes (based on anecdotal evidence) were never backed up like most of the points in her book. A lot of her points all stem from the fact that there were only 3 available midwives for her birth (one who was to be out of town during her due date, one who was too far away, and one who she had a personality conflict with.) The remainder of her anecdotes focused on ONE midwife who had never attended a birth where the mother was in a particular position."
5,A book deeply rooted in reality about birth,"This book is a definite must-read for any woman that is thinking of conceiving a child or who is already pregnant. This book is not ""on the fringe"", despite its slightly shocking title. ;) It is a book for all women (and the men who love them) about how to go about getting a birth that is satisfying for the couple, as well as ensuring the most safety for mother and baby. It is a real book that tells the truth about what you're really gaining, and missing, when you leave the OB and the midwife knocking at your door.One thing I really appreciated was the chapter devoted to men's experiences of birth. This is a topic not covered in many other books, and definitely not in this kind of detail. Every woman knows that it's one thing to talk to a woman about birth, and a total other thing to talk to a man about what they want. It is their baby too, and this book is written for the couple.I will be buying this book for all my pregnant friends to read!"
1,Malfunctioned with first use,"I bought this memory card when i bought Final Fantasy IX. It was the first time I used the card and my FFIX data was the only thing saved on the card. After 11 hours of gameplay I tried to load my game only to find that the data was corrupt and my saved game unrecoverable. If you want to be able to load your games I recommend a Sony memory card. It costs a few dollars more but I have never had one fail on me. I used the same one for 3 years and it never failed I used this one and it failed on the first time. Oh, and the storage case broke out of the box."
3,You're better off buying a Sony memory card.,"The only reason I bought this memory card instead of a Sony brand memory card, was because the Sony brand was out of stock on amazon. I've had a few problems using this card, but it's never erased or corrupted any game. Sometimes when I'm loading a game, the game will say that there is no memory card inserted. I just take the card out and put it back in. That's done the trick for me every time. (maybe I'm just lucky)"
1,Pop goes the memory card!!,"Thanks to this shoddy product, almost twenty hours of Final Fantasy IX gameplay went out the window. Nothing else really puts a nice look on your face like a 'data corrupted' error. Don't by this card."
5,MARY J,WHEN MARY SAYS THANKS TO ALL MY FANS... I JUST SAY HEY MARY #1 FAN RIGHT HERE. PLEASE BELIEVE SHE IS THE BOMB.
4,Mary Rocks!,"This CD is amazing. Unfortunately the first 4 songs are really short. Just mini clips of her ""What's the 411"" CD. I'm loving it, a must buy if you are a huge Mary fan like me!"
5,Mary J is OFF THE HOOK!,"The ""Tour"" CD is absolutely fantastic. I didn't realise that she had such a great voice. There is quite of bit of cursing......so I wouldn't advise that small children listen to it but she is the bomb!"
5,THE QUEEN,"I have ALL of Mary's CD and this one is a wonderful collabation of all of her hits. She takes you from 'What's the 411' to 'Share My World' and she keeps it hype through out. I went to this concert when she came to Nashville and she is really L-I-V-E for real. As on the album she gets the crowd into it to. To the person in Greensville,SC apparently you have never heard a tour album or been to a real concert, THEY NOT SUPPOSE TO DO 5 to 7 minute tracks or it would go on forever. I guess ya'll don't have concerts in your little town. But anyways Mary you are the undisbuted queen of hiphop so there is gonna be some haters. You Go Girl!"
1,"Why Mary, Why?","I just have to ask the question why? Mary J. Blige has put out some very good albums, but this album is just terrible. First of all it seems like a medley of her hits rather than the usual 5 to 7 minute per song on each track. Second, this ----- she has rapping through the album was not needed. His profanity just takes away from the album having a chance to be a hit, in fact it's a major turn off. And last I just went and traded this album in for Lauryn Hill's new one which is more thought provoking. Ask yourself why none of the radio stations are playing Mary J. Bliges ""The Tour"" and you'll realize this album was not needed in her career at this point."
2,To much hype-man (drop the mike-man),"I love Mary. Her voice is unique and I have all her CD's. But this hype-man (or ""drop the mike-man"") is very annoying. If she got rid of him the CD would be so much better."
5,Mary J. is Da Queen!!!,"This live album of Mary's collective hits is terrific...She sends out soulful melodies on her live versions of Seven Days, Missing You and my personal favorite Misty Blue...She has come a long way as far as her vocal performance and I have always supported her music...She is the only artist whose CD I would buy without even listening to it...I believe that she can deliver...She has a soulful voice that no other female entertainer can match...Miss Blige surely delivers on ""THE TOUR"" Good luck in everything you decide to do in the future Mary...!!!..."
1,The Worst Corrs' song EVER,"Here's the thing about the Corrs: When they're good, they're really good and when they're bad, they're dreadful. ""Would you be Happier?"" is one of those dreadful moments. If I could give it zero stars I would. The message of the song is great but the lyrics they use to express that message sounds like a child wrote them. The music is so VERY corny. I can't believe that they thought this was good enough to put on an album called ""Best of""--that's the worst thing they could have done because up against some of their better tunes this [weak] little number sounds even worse.[...]"
4,Found what I was looking for,It sure was great I found this CD....it has one of my favorite songs...Shake Up....I made a copy of that one song for my niece who lost hers and she didn't know where she got it from. It was from me. Thanks for getting it.
3,"Good, but only half salsa","This is a very nice CD if you don't expect to hear 12 tracks of salsa. Only about half of the songs can qualify as salsa. Some of them are really good (Rapada, Anna Maria, Flores y Tambores) and make the buy worth while even for those who expected strictly salsa. The rest of the songs are sons, cha-cha's, etc. Still good."
4,A Unique Album,"We first realized salsa had gone global after hearing Orquesta del Sol (""Japan's first salsa band""); indeed, a successor group, Orquesta de Luz (see, for example,Lo Esencial) is on this album. More than the mastery of salsa from musicians outside of the traditional powerhouses, however, this album also represents new influences from outsiders who have made ""salsa"" their own. Perhaps the most intriguing example of this is Mana Janab Ne Pukara Nahin, which sounds a bit like Hindi Santana. We say ""salsa"" in quotes because, as others have noted, ""salsa"" seems to be shorthand for the various Afro-Cuban rhythyms of Latin America represented on this album. Nonetheless, it is true that ""salsa"" is effectively shorthand for Afro-Cuban music for much of the world - a world that has become increasingly exposed to these genres. The album, in the end, represents globalization at its best and maybe a glimpse of what ""salsa fusion"" will sound like."
3,Not Salsa!,"This is a great cha-cha album, but the title is somewhat of a misnomer as little of the music is actually salsa. If your aim is to buy a compilation for dancing salsa, there are other decent albums out there that might prove more suitable."
5,Blueprint for Success: SPRINTS,"Arrived on time as described. Video was well paced. Mark Brady did a terrific job of providing demonstrations by his student athletes as the drills are described. I am a long time track coach and loved it. Played it. Stopped to rewind and played again. Took notes and was able to implement two of them the next day. I would not only recommend this for beginners looking for a starting point but even a long time gray beard like myself who can pick up a few new tricks. For example he had a drill he called his ""Max Velocity Run"" that I found worth the money of the video in itself!!!"
3,Secret Garden,"The animation doesn't flow very smoothly, but the music is wonderful. My daughter was still singing the songs weeks after we returned this video to the rental store. She has been asking for it for her birthday. (4 years old) Followed the story fairly closely. Talking animals add to the fun."
5,De Mi Alma Flamenca,"As I said in a previous write up, I am a former student of Maestro Cordoba and so of course his recordings mean a great deal to me! He was a great musician and ;hearing him again is a very moving experience for me! So glad to have these memorable CD's!"
5,Panazonic = Amazing,"amazing sound for such a small compact unit, cool door that hinges out to open folding in the center. very sleek look picks up a lot of radio stations"
3,"CD Sound Quality Poor, Radio and MP3 Sound OK","I guess for a low-end product, this isn't that bad, but I was disappointed. Basing my confidence on the Panasonic name, I bought this system and gave my son my older Phillips system (more of a boom box and probably ten or more years old) because I wanted to be able to play my MP3s.My old Phillips had better, crisper sound. CDs in particular play poorly on this new system. If it wasn't for the MP3 port, I'd give this one to my son and ask for my old boom box back.A disappointment."
4,Great Table Top or Office Stereo,I was pleasantly surprised with the sound of this nice little stereo. The system looks like a piece of high end stereo equipment and by gosh it certainly aspires to sound like one. Spend the extra $20 for this unit and you will be glad you did.
3,Minor adjustments,"The things that really count here are great...sound, quality, price, easer of operation. BUT it is really hard to see the digital read out for the station-cd band AND it is always a challenge to get the cd to fit on to the spindle. Other than that....."
5,Great bargain,"I am so pleased with this small unit. The sound is terrific. Naturally you are not going to get concert hall sound, but the sound on this unit is full and also adjustable. It has the usual Panasonic high quality.I recommend this player to anyone, especially if your space like ours is limited. We are full time RVrs and I can set it up and take it down in no time.Highly recommended!"
5,Pool house stereo,"I was looking for an inexpensive system to power two outdoor rock speakers next to my pool and was blown away by the great choice I made. The system is setup in my pool house. It sounds great and has some nice features. The sleep timer lets the system shut off after a preset time. I set it, swim, go into the house, and it shuts itself off. What I found most useful was the automatic turn on/turn off feature. I keep a bird-song CD in it and it comes on for an hour every morning to fill my yard with the sounds of wildlife. The local birds love it. I also like the audio input jack that lets me connect my MP3 player as a source."
4,Excellent sound -remote dependent,"The sound is excellent, but don't lose the remote. Just about everything is dependent upon it with no easy way to control the unit form the front panel.Some things are impossible without the remote (like setting the time). BTW, when the unit is off the time displays but it is not backlit so you can not see it in the dark.Also, the unit will play mp3 format ONLY through the music port and will not play MP3 from a cd."
5,"Good Deal, Great Sound","We were looking for a small, inexpensive stereo we could put in our sunroom that had enough power to be heard on the deck. We were impressed with the styling, ease of use, and quality. We were surprised that such a little unit had the power we were looking for. The remote has a lot of features and is easy to use. We are very pleased with our purchase."
5,Panasonic SA-EN25,"Hello, I am Cherry. I recently purchased the Panasonic mini system, and I am enjoying it very much. I think it's a wonderful little system for my little room. It doesn't take up lots of spaces and it has good sound."
5,just what I wanted,I had already bought one of these for my home and a friend just loved mine so I was very happy to find the exact same product to buy for a christmas gift for that friend and it was reduced. So thanks for a great little music system very pleased.
3,I think I'm Cool Too....But I don't need to write a book.,"Let me start by saying that I think Matt Drudge is a pretty cool guy. But he does something too many celebrities do, he believes his own public image and never thinks he's wrong. I'll be the first to say that what he has done is astonishing. But it has been a while since he broke a major story.....perhaps too many parties to attend. An OK read, but not a keeper."
5,An inside look at the man who revolutionized the news.,"Matt Drudge has single-handedly neutered the ABCCBSNBCWASHINGTONPOSTNEWYORKTIMES monolith's hold on the news in this country. With sass and a healthy contempt for ""the establishment"" he has created a counter-culture of his own of news-junkies who want ""just the facts, ma'am, just the facts,"" and not a continuous diet of the same liberal twaddle day after day.In this book you'll meet the man behind the scene who scooped the world media and almost brought down a president. But Drudge will be remembered for far more than Lewinsky; Drudge has broken the left's hegemony of the news reporting in this country, and they don't like it.A great, great read."
2,Annoying and repetitious--and I like Matt Drudge,"The book was a disappointment. It was a rehash of material that had appeared on his Web site, so for those of us who read it daily, little was new. Also, it was written in a 50s or 60s stream of consciousness style that I found irritating. If his Web site were written in that manner, it would never have achieved the popularity that it has (and that it richly deserves). I'm sorry the book was such a let down for me, as I'd certainly looked forward to reading it. Maybe next time...."
3,Writing is Not HIs Forte'!,"Drudge is great at searching out and reporting the news and as much as I enjoy his style, the book disappointed me. It does not flow and was a tough read. I worked at going back to it and completed it over time. Style is what drags the book down, content is excellent."
5,Makes 'legitimate' reporters look like the fools they are...,"This book rocks! Fun read about how he has scooped all the major media again and again, and how they are not equipped to respond. Drudge sometimes gets it wrong, as he admits, but he has never accused Americans of using poison gas, as did Ted Turner's CNN and Time Magazine; and he single-handedly exposed the activities that caused the first impeachment of a President in 100 years. Not bad for a single guy who likes cats....and thanks to Drudge, no one will ever watch Bill Clinton chomping his cigar without chuckling...."
1,"Surprisingly, the worst book I've read","Don't get me wrong...I'm a huge Drudge fan. I reload his site about 20 times each day and am thoroughly convinced he has the best news and politics site on the web. I also like his radio show.That being said, however, this is a horrible book. Completely disorganized. Highly repetitive. Very little to say. (Evidenced by the fact that the last 20 or 30 pages are merely copies of e-mails sent to him by readers).I know Drudge is intelligent. Anyone who saw him fend off the sharks at the National Press Club luncheon can vouch for that. But you wouldn't know it reading his book. If he writes another book, I doubt it will sell 1000 copies based on this performance.Bottom line: Pass on this one. If you must see for yourself just how bad this book is, do yourself a favor and wait for a 99 cent used paperback."
1,Dang Near Unreadable - a massive ego trip,"I have not seen such a thicket of incomprehensible writing since the death of Marshall McLuhan. This book reads as though Drudge had a book contract to fulfill, was down to a deadline, and just cut-and-pasted randomly from his hard drive. If there is a pattern to what he has written here, it was not discernable. What makes the book so disappointing is that it stands in such stark contrast to what Drudge has published on the Internet, which is remarkable in its clarity. My recommendation is skip the book, but bookmark the Drudge Report on your web browser."
1,Sludge Manipeesto,"Welll, Drudge certainly doesn't manifest much of a brain, I can tell you that. Ultimately as empty as his alleged website, Links-R-Us."
1,Nothing new -nothing exciting,No bombshells - nothing that makes you flip the pages with anticipation. Should of waited for the library to get a copy.
1,Brutal book,The book is horrible. This guy was a one hit wonder and now he's trying to exploit it with a boring and long-winded book.Save your money!
1,"Punchy, paranoid and irresponsible","What nice things can you say about a guy whose claim to fame is preempting ethical journalism?His writing in this book is suitably punchy; Drudge, after all, writes pretty good headlines. His copy, however, is woefully amateurish.He could probably make a legitimate living in journalism if he played by the rules -- but he's far too paranoid for that. Fact-checking, Drudge grouses, is a tool of suppression.He's so successful he'd be due a little respect -- if he weren't so irresponsible. That, in fact, is what's so damning about this book: a sleazy, quote-bending interview with Gore's nanny; smear after smear thrown at legitimate news organizations. Slash-and-burn to make a buck is Drudge's MO.This is disingenuous, self-aggrandizing puffery.There's not even any good dirt."
1,Drudge Manifesto,"I ordered The O'Reilly Factor and Drudge was recommended as well. Since I knew I was going to be down with painful shoulder surgery I thought what the heck, ""send it as well"" That way I would have plenty to read. Little did I know the pain of trying to read this book would be worse than my shoulder surgery. While I love the web and am on it every day, when I get ready to read, I want a book that flows easily. I don't want to have to know HTML to decipher a book. Half of the people in the book... (of the fifty or so pages I tried to read), I've never heard of. I'm pretty politically savy, but I don't want to have to take a wild guess at who the characters are. Next time Matt, explain yourself, or give us a dictionary of terms."
3,"Good tidbits of info, but irritating/weak writing",There are very good pieces of gossip and insight into Drudge's daily life. Stream of conciousness writing is poor and loses you attention quickly. I gave up because it never gets started. A rambling journal with very little background or manifesto in it.
3,Just what you would expect from a manifesto,"If you read the Drudge Report on a regular basis and ever wonder what makes the man tick, you should read this book. His views on the main stream media may be out there, but if you're a regular reader of his website, this book will put his motivations into context. Be prepared though, Drudge's writing style is, ummm.... unconventional."
1,ReallyBadHardToReadNoPunctuationIt'llDriveYouCrazy,"I visit Drudge's Web site almost every day, but I couldn't get through more than one-quarter of THE DRUDGE MANIFESTO. The book is written in an extremely disjointed, almost incoherent style -- choppy incomplete sentences, longstringsoftextwithnospacesbetweenthewords, weird HTML language that means nothing to me, fanciful dialogues between Drudge and his cat, copyright and trademark symbols printed everywhere for no apparent reason, and long, irrelevant, boring descriptions of parties Drudge has attended and the celebrities who either a) smiled at him tolerantly or b) glared at him malevolently. (If you're dying to know that Annette Bening gave Drudge a cold stare, this book is for you.) I like what Drudge has done to open up the Fourth Estate, but he's no author."
3,Better than I expected,"Really, this book is much better than I expected. The guy's not a great writer given to spinning webs of narrative and metaphor nor even a competent writer driven for balance and care. He's kind of a hack, but he's proud of that. I wanted to hate him for what he did, but it was hard to argue with his goal of offsetting the weight of corporate media. He's a one-man band. We can't hope for a Jeffersonian democracy without learning to live with people who don't agree. They can't all be Michael Moore."
4,the dawning of a new era,"100 years from now when the history of the eary internet is written, Al Gore's name will be at best a mere footnote, but Matt Drudge's name will be forever linked with internet news. Whether you like him or not, the way we get news where we get it and how we get will never be the same after Matt Drudge.""Drudge a Manifesto"" could barely be called a ""Manifesto"" (Drudge a memior would be more apt.) it contains a minimum of motive and little in the way of future intentions. It does contain a lot of knocks at the old guard media however. Mostly written in a unique rapid fire kind of sentence sturcture that works well with the subtle but bitting humor and cultural satire in this book. If you were thinking of purchasing this book for new tid bits in the Clinton scandals or other Hollywood stories, forget it there realy isn't any thing new here. but it is a fun easy, light read worth the price of the book."
1,'xcuse me while I kiss myself!,"Drudge's web site is entertaining because he's a genius at writing funny, sensational and jaw-dropping headlines. Headlines for other people's writing. When he writes his own short bits on the web site they usually run along the lines of, ""I went to this DC party and tried to get in Mr. X's face, but he gave me a DIRTY LOOK and ignored me! Developing..."". This booklet proves that he's not much of a writer on his own, or with a co-author! The Manifesto boils down to this: complete sentences, fact checking and punctuation marks are tools of the media elite. 6th graders around the world are rejoicing."
2,Hype does not equal quality,"I've never really liked Matt Drudge. Never really hated him, either. His website is sometimes informative, sometimes annoying, sometimes uncoscionably biased. Unfortunately, this book tends towards the last two. Thumbs down, Drudge!"
1,Blech,"The previous review sums Drudge up perfectly -- an 11-year-old Republican finds him wonderful. In reality, Drudge has less credibility than the National Enquirer. He cannot tell the difference between rumor, tall tale, paranoia, or truth. He splats them all out there. Look at the book-cover pose -- Drudge thinks of himself as a latter-day Walter Winchell, who also was a man who also couldn't tell a fact from rumor. Entertaining? Sure. News? Hardly."
1,"Smug, rambling, and uninformative","I really rely on his website for some of the news the big guys won't cover... and visit his site like clockwork ...buuuuut... unfortunately, this book is nothing more than a disorganized, rambling, huge pat on his own back. One of the things you catch right away (impossible to miss with the constant repetitions) is a huge ""who cares what ANYBODY thinks about me or what I do"". Unfortunately, this seems to bleed through into his attitude toward those reading his book as well. Scattered here and there are a couple chuckles and one or two new insights into the ""big, bad, system"", but I admit I wish I had waited until it (quickly) showed up at my local used bookstore."
1,Library report,"My local public library system had hundreds of holds for this title before it was published. Within months, I could find multiple copies on the shelf of any branch I visited. Sort of like when a movie opens huge and then drops 50% or more the second weekend. There's a reason for it."
1,"Perhaps inspired by Bob Dylan's ""Tarantula""?","Well, maybe not, but at least in the sense that Drudge seems to have ignored all rules of punctuation with this effort. It's extremely hard to read, and harder to understand. In an effort to appear cutting edge and hip, something went awry.I like Drudge, but this is garbage."
2,One Readable Section,"I like Drudge. I think he is the epitome of the new wave of Internet journalists, and to some extent he inspired me in the creation of my own Orvetti.com. But he should stick to the Web. Drudge Manifesto reads like his website -- perhaps that's the point -- and is rambling and often incoherent. In short, there's no book here, just lots of snippets that Drudge doesn't even try to tie together. There is one section I highly acclaim, though: The bit at the end where Drudge quotes Peter Orvetti of the Orvetti Political Report."
2,I coulda been somebody,"Drudge could have been a contender. He could have been a legend that they'd be making movies about in 2070. But he doesn't have the talent. How can he be the cutting edge of journalism when he can't write his own book--what writing there is--and had it ghost written by Julia Philips. I wish Drudge was HL Mencken, cleaning the halls of the new millenium, with new sparking prose. But he's just a pale, amusing geek with a modem and a good deal of chutzpah."
1,Worst book I've ever tried to read,"I found the book extremely hard to read. Incomplete sentences, words with no spaces between them, reducncy throughout. The book could have been written on two sheets of 8 1/2 by 11 double spaced pages. I like Matt Drudge, at least his web site, and I liked his television show when it was on, but a book writer he isn't."
1,Awful,I read up to page 88 and i'm not sophisticated enough to interpret all your alphabetical inferences and also your references!You should have included an index for these translations! I cannot recommend nor read any more 1 What a waste of time and money! I'm sure if it were written in a narrative manner it would have been more informative and interesting. Gus Abood
5,Snippets are GREAT!,"If you're an american, you'll appreciate the energy behind this one! If you're not an american, you'll want to be one (we'll let you in, just ask!) Not having reading this book in its entirety yet, I am commenting on the snippets I have seen and know it to be very entertaining!!!!!"
1,Dreck is too kind a word,to describe this pile of trash disguised as a book. Save your money for toilet paper.
1,We Are in Trouble,"As this book shows, Matt Drudge has media power far beyond his ken. If this is the future of the media, we are all in trouble."
5,My favorite book of this genre,"I just wanted to say that this book is THE VERY BEST compilation of wisdom and contemplation that I have ever read outside of the Bible itself. The photographs which accompany the text send your mind to dream-like places however they really exist on this world! Unfortunately for me, but fortunate for my good friend, I gave my only copy as a gift of love... I am going to get my eager hands (and my mind) on another copy right away! Do yourself a favor & get this book. You will not regret it :-)"
3,4 decades of 'some' memorable rock,"Although the product itself is nice, it seems some of the music escapes me. Maybe its the years I was in the service during Vietnam. Some of the music is very memorable;some I don't ever recall hearing it. Could be that I was just aloof at the time. It is a very good variety of eclectic music that most older audiophile buffs would appreciate."
2,Good Idea But Flawed,"I wrote a review before but amazon saw fit to delete it. OK - Folk Rock Began (and make NO mistake here) with Mr. Tambourine Man by the Byrds, the answer to the British Invasion. There is no Mr. Tambourine Man on this box set for some reason and if it is due to licensing, fine -but you really have to start there. Harry Nilsson has no right to be here. The Youngbloods, yes. We Five - yes. Also - where - oh God where is the 1966 Jefferson Airplane? Folk Rock (and yes, I was there folks) was 1965 to EARLY 1967 before psychedelia. After Disc 1, there was NO FOLK ROCK LEFT. The influence was there to a degree, but that was it. It began January 1965 and was gone as of June 1967. I personally love it still but there really is NO 4 decades of it - just the ""influence"" of it."
5,Folk Rock,"I am a teacher, and I incorporate music any way I can. I love this fold rock and us the music to study novels and history. This has been a must to have for me and my students."
2,Could have been so much better,"This set doesn't know what it wants to be. Some tracks are clearly definitive of their respective periods, while the others are marginal (or, certainly, non-definitive) tracks by great artists.I'd say this is about a CD and a half's worth of definitive folk-rock songs from various periods -- along with two and a half CD's worth of an extended sampler/teaser CD of great artists, showcasing something other than their definitive songs/recordings.Could have been so much better if the label had a focused viewpoint.What in the world was Time-Life thinking on this one?If you can buy it for 4 bucks a CD, it might be worth it -- but just barely. Or, instead, seek out better representations elsewhere by some of these very talented artists."
3,Good ole music,"Most of the songs are oldies and good ones, some of them I don't remember ever hearing."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"My fiance was a best man in a wedding recently and had never given a speech before. So I bought this book and another one. Boy am I glad that I bought the other book, because this one was no help at all. It only gives you examples of specific toasts and speeches for specific families. It doesn't help. It's not generic enough for someone to put together their own speech from it. It doesn't tell you how to write a speech or do's and don'ts about writing toasts. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want a good book for this, buy The Best Man's Handbook. It has way more useful information on speeches and toasts than most speech books."
1,Big disappointment!,"This ink is not recognized by the printer (Canon Pixma) even though the description said opposite, do not buy this!"
2,reliablity of product,"B/W cartridge works, but printer does not recognize it as a replacement. Color cartridge was unrecognizable, and could not be used. 0 for 2 is not a positive sign for purchasing re-manufactured cartridges."
2,They Fit is about all I can say...,"Two stars because they fit my printer and because they had some ink in them.I bought these as a low cost replacement to Canon's outrageously priced ink cartridges. These fit exactly as you would expect, but the printer indicated they were both empty and so required me to bypass the error generated by the printer for empty cartridges.Additionally, the cartridges only lasted a few pages before running out of ink. Don't waste your money."
1,dont work,"I put the color cartridge in my canon pixma ip 1700, it gave a message , insert cartridge., so i did , still wont work, put orig canon back in its fine, dont buy they dont work . says they are compatible , not ....they arent."
2,Would not purchase again,"First the positives...delivery was prompt, good price. Now the negatives...my computer would not recognize the cartridges. Not a big problem, but the color is terrible...that IS a problem. Doesn't look anything like what I'm trying to print. The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" holds true in this case and I'll pay extra to have true color and skip the re-manufactures."
2,"After buying 4 sets, I've had two duds","I've had very mixed results with these cartridges. The first time I bought a set of black ink and color cartridges... they worked just fine and lasted about as long as the Canon brand (I only print maybe 10-20 pages a week). The second time I bought two sets, the black ink only lasted about a week before I had to change it (same use, 10-20 pages). The replacement worked fine though so I thought maybe it was just one dud, not the norm. I recently bought a fourth set when it was time to change cartridges again. I had the same problem I had the second time around. The black ink cartridge only lasted a week (again, with only 10 prints max). I had to go out and buy a canon cartridge to replace it.At this point, I would say it's not worth it if there are this many duds floating around. They might be cheaper at first, but (at least for me) they only work correctly about half the time which cost me more money to replace."
5,canon cl-41&pg-40 remanufactured combo set of ink cartridges,"I had just one little problem and Amazon and OCProducts came through with the proper remedy, the ink cartridges are very good and they are full I will be ordering from them in again."
1,My printer would not work with these cartridges,"My Canon Pixma ip2600 printer saw each newly installed cartridge as empty. I tried to get the printer to print anyway, but the machine would not function. Although these remanufactured cartridges had instructions to close the dialog box and ignore the out of ink message, the printer would not work.This is a lesson learned. This printer will ONLY work with new Canon source original cartridges. There is no economy to be found in substitutes as they are money wasted. They will not function in the printer.If a remanufacturer can overcome this problem so that the printer actually communicates with the cartridge, then a solution has been found. Until then -- originals only."
4,Geraldine Page is an Amercan treasure of stage and screen,"Although the great Geraldine Page died in 1987, her brilliant screen performances live on! Nominated for 8 Oscars and winner of 1 for Best Actress for her last film ""The Trip to Bountiful"" in 1986, I find it surprising that many of her films for which she was Oscar nominated are not on DVD (yet). ""Summer and Smoke"", ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" (both Tennessee Williams classic works in which she lit up the screen)and ""The Trip to Bountiful"" are just 3 examples. Hopefully, her devoted fans won't have to wait too much longer."
4,Already out-of-print . . .,"The Canadian Brass originally recorded Bach's 'The Art of the Fugue' in 1988. Sony released it under its 'Sony Classics' bargain line in Fall 2001. Sadly, it's already out-of-print. This disc represents sort of an exercise for showcasing all of the elements associated with Baroque music. It's an interesting work, even if it sometimes seems disjointed. Personally, I prefer a coherent work over a 'musical exercise.' Nonetheless, the piece is interesting, if only because it features all of the musical elements at Bach's disposal during the Baroque era.If you can still find it, go ahead and buy it (especially if you can find it used). You might not listen to it every month (as you might Bach's Brandenburg Concertos or other orchestral works), but it's historic, and therefore worth a listen."
5,The one band who most deserves to make it,"Having spent many years frequenting the clubs and venues of Nashville, TN., I have seen more varieties of music than most. And being in Nashville means that all of it is good. However, it is rare to find a truly original band not trying to embody one stereotype or another. Whether they're in cowboy hats or leisure suits, the Luxury Liners put on a fantastic, interactive show filled with wonderful and fun music. They're a happy-go-lucky band which doesn't get bogged down with trying to be highly stylish or trendy. Instead, they blend the best of the early Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel with the harder rock of today's alternative radio, all under the mantra of Graham Parsons. Throw in a few random Elvis and Cher covers and you have a group to whom you will never tire of listening. I count myself lucky to have found them before the rest of the world since I can then enjoy them that much longer."
5,"Near Pefect, looks and sounds better then ever","First off I own several of the old VHS tapes and was able to do a full comparison and this set rocks!!!The video is near perfect (I didn't see any green blotches) smooth rendering and obviously taken from the original film. The audio is perfectly fine, no problem with ""bad mixing"" or anything else. I also love the photo gallery!Highly recommended, makes a great xmas gift!"
2,Disappointed,"Sorry but, I was real disappointed with the overall quality of this DVD. The picture was NOT clear, it looks out of focus. The sound is horrible! I could barely watch the dang thing, like what has been brought to attention in other reviews ,the effects sound is so loud you cant hear the dialog. The only reason I gave 2 stars is I just love this cartoon, one of my favorites. I had an old store bought VHS and it way better quality. I just hope the VOL. 2 is better."
2,Disappointing,"The Dolby sound is awful; in fact, you can't even hear some of the dialogue on the dvd."
3,Great video,Sound was not so good. Background sounds were too loud. Couldn't hear dialog very well. Picture was very clear though.
3,Do not buy if you are a Macintosh user.,"While the information in the book was helpful, I was not able to use the included CD on my Macintosh computer."
5,The Tears of San Antonio,"I am almost at a loss for words that would properly portray, or adequately convey to anyone contemplating reading this, the most recent, and most emotionally and historically complex story ever offerd by this author. The research alone, not to mention the personal knowledge and experience, of the author, must have been very extensive and highly personal. This fact will become most obviously evident to any reader very early in their journey with the individuals and the families of San Antonio to the United States. For those of us who grew up in the multicultural neighborhoods of the CN,NY,& NJ metropolitan area, it is impossible NOT to completely become entranced by, and somehow incorporated into, this well written anthology. ""BRAVA,Signora Tracksler! BRAVA!!...ENCORE!...ENCORE!!"""
2,Not Very Good,This pepper mill looks nice but functions horribly. The handle is too small which makes it painful to use. It left the peppercorns in big chunks or turned them into fine dust. I threw this one in the trash and bought the Unicorn KeyTop Pepper Mill which I love.
5,An excellent guide for beginners.,"This book is for people who want to do it right-- if you're looking for shortcuts to writing calligraphy, you won't find it here. The author gives you all the rules, techniques, and points to remember for creating authentic calligraphy, and starts with the oldest forms (with their brief histories) onward. It's interesting to discover some of the evolutions and developments of the written letter; this book gives you an appreciation for them. The entire book is even written in longhand calligraphy, not machine-typed, with a lot of good examples and projects. Excellent guide."
2,Calligaraphy,I didn't realize it was not an actual book but a booklet with that spirally thing as a spine which I didn't like.
2,Lousy edition,"As BrutalMusic has mentioned, there are several illegible pages because of poor scanning. The layout is unlike any other book I've seen: odd-numbered pages on the left, even-numbered on the right. Even the title page is on the left side!"
2,Waite's introduction is the best part of the book,"This book has some interesting insight, but not a whole lot. For the price, it would be better if it was a hardcover so it could look nice on the shelf, since its not getting opened again."
3,Entertaing Read but No Practical Value,"This is loaded with Eliphas' ideas about magic. He was a Catholic priest and in this book, you will also read his bragging about Catholicism and also you get to know this person had a lot of self-pride (too much, in fact).The other part is supposed to be about practical stuff. But there isn't anything complete or detailed enough to perform a real ritual.It is rather amusing that Eliphas Levi was considered the ""last magus"" when the only ritual he performed to communicate with the dead Apollonius of Tyana frightened the wits out of him. Such was the greatness of this magus!! I am sure there are better magicians more befitting of the word ""magus"".This book should be treated as light reading. If you are expecting to be a magician after reading this book,... sorry this won't do! There are better ones out there for those aspiring to be magicians."
4,Make sure you fit them correctly,"I have these boots and I love them. I rated them 4 stars just because I always feel there is room for improvement. I still experience some pain and some days are better than others. For aggressive skiing, and for women who weigh more than 110 pounds, these boots are great.Boots are all about fit. I urge you to get measured at a ski shop and DO NOT buy a boot bigger than they measure you. Often times when people buy ski boots, they are trying to avoid being in pain all the time. The BIGGEST mistake is not being fit properly and therefore causing yourself pain. IF YOU BUY BOOTS TOO BIG YOU WILL CAUSE YOURSELF ALL SORTS OF PAIN."
3,Man and Woman in the Dunes,"Director Lech Majewski titles each scene with a Biblical word in his very surreal movie set in the California desert observing a couple whose marriage is disintegrating like a sand castle on a beach. Religious allegory abounds here-the creator is a strong black man, there is an obligatory crucifixion, etc.Made in 1994, this is the sort of movie a serious fangirl might want to ferret out! Typical early Viggo choice-edgy, intelligent, witty script and other excellent actors. However, I bet it didn't get much of a run in the theatres and if Mr. Mortensen hadn't gone on to play Aargorn, I doubt it would have ever been released on DVD!"
3,A little strange,"This is ""the kind of movie you'll like if you like that kind of movie"". A lot of symbolism. As a fan of Viggo Mortensen and Jennifer Rubin I enjoyed their performances, but I couldn't really help wondering at certain points what was going on."
4,Good text for online class.,"I'm using this book in an online trig class. Despite the lack of class instruction I'm able to move along by reading the text and doing the problems. It's a little wordy at times, but, as I'm learning in the online class, math can be a difficult subject to express in words alone."
1,not what I expected,"This study guide is not what you think it is. As supposed to help you solve the problems in the actual text book, it only has ADDITIONAL problems. So if you get stuck on a problem in the book, you cannot go to this study guide and see how it's done. Other study guides I've had before this one have been extremely helpful and I almost never had to go to the tutorials because I could just go to the study guide to get help. Here - not so much. It's not a complete waste, but a disappointment."
2,not such a great deal,"Took longer than expected to arrive and was not in the best shape, but it still saved me money to buy it!"
2,A DISSAPOINTMENT,I think this CD is terrible and a waste of money. No disrespect to Dream Theater - I think all their previous releases except for 'Falling into Inifnity' are masterpieces. But I also feel like any TRUE Dream Theater fan who says this is a good release is in denial over the fact that Dream Theater has already reached their peak and is on the decline. I say take the money you were going to spend on this cd and pick up THE ODYSSEY by Symphony X instead. That was the cd that made Symphony X by favorite band. Guess who my old favorite band was?
3,What to say?,What to say? Four virtuoso musicians who can play their instruments like masters. But SCENES FROM A MEMORY is really better than this one here.
5,Another Masterpiece,"This time it is a double CD. Six songs. Amazing songs. The songs that no one else could ever write. It is a special album, a gift of true music.I feel it's needless to review every song. I would just recommend it to anyone. Even if you're not into heavy metal, just skip the track #1 and listen to the rest with no stopping.A timeless classic, it is that good!"
2,Major dissapointment,This album sounds a lot like falling into infinity. Very weak compositions. It does not capture the magic of awake.
5,Awesome,"DT never ceases to amaze the ear-drums! These guys are simply put, AWESOME! And yes, that includes the best singer ever, James LaBrie!"
3,A good album but far away from the band's true potential,"Overall a good album, but really ""too little"" after their remarkable ""Scenes of a memory"" work. Fans will buy it anyway but for the new listener the fore-mentioned work is recommended. Dream Theater come across technically perfect (as always), but lacking the creativity, complexion and inspiration that they've displayed in the past."
1,Bad,"This album is not very good. All of the DT fanboys (who come here with their unconditional love of these guys) are doing everyone a disservice. I remember hearing this album for the first time back when it came out and I was disappointed. I figured that I might grow to like it, but here we are 18 months later and its still a stinker. Hey Dream Theater, here's some advice: ITS ABOUT QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY. Stop making 40 side-project albums a year and just concentrate on writing good DT songs. They don't need to be 20 minutes long, and they don't need a 5 minute solo from each musician, thats what concerts are for. Learn how to write decent lyrics too. I will not be buying your next disc if it sucks like this one."
1,BLAH BLAH DT,the 1st CD here is horrid- long overdrawn tracks- the 2nd CD is much more tasty- but for 22 bucks?!?!?!?! no- 2nd worst DY behind TRAIN WRECK- pick up awake or images and words- 5 star albums there- oh yeah-- or scenes- great prog- not this
2,Overturbulent,What else can I say? This is not the Dream Theater I once knew.Thought I wasted my money but I hope it goes towards brighter Dreams.
1,By Plagiarism Be Driven,"It's over people. DT is done. If SFAM wasn't proof enough this is the absolute last nail in the coffin of a once great band. This directionless drivel is musical recycling at it's worst. ""Glass Prison"" is a jumbled mess of stolen Megadeth (""Disconnect"") and Opeth riffs (""The Moor""). ""Blind Faith"" starts out uninteresting and at half the running time dilutes into boring fret-wanking. ""Misunderstood"" heavily smacks of SFAM's ""Finally Free"". ""The Great Debate"" is nothing more than a cross between Tool's ""46&2"" and Rush's ""Natural Science"" and ""Disappear"" is a half-assed remake of ""Space-Dye Vest"". It doesn't get any better on disc 2; ""The Test That Stumped Them All"" hijacks both Pantera's ""By Demons Be Driven"" and Tool's ""Ticks & Leeches"" and ""Solitary Shell"" is Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" just with different lyrics. The cheesy ouverture is the best about this epic failure."
2,Disappointed...,"I am a huge Dream Theater fan--they were practically the only band I listened to for a couple of years! I really liked their last album, Scenes from a Memory, so with much anticipation, I bought Six Degrees. I was shocked--I HATE it! I have hardly been capable of listening to it, it ... so bad! It is cliche and uninteresting. What the hell happened? I would recommend branching out to something more interesting like Symphony X, until DT comes up with something better."
1,By Plagiarism Be Driven,"It's over folks. DT is done. Well, that's what this album firmly suggest. It was bad enough to hear them recycle the stuff from their better days (I&W, Awake) on ""Scenes From A Memory"" and try to pass it as a masterpiece (and almost everyone fell for it) but the constant musical thievery going on on this....dreck is too much for me to bear; stolen Pantera, Tool and Rush riffs everywhere. The lyrics are on elementary-school level; even Linkin Park writes more poetic stuff. And the 'songs' (and I use that term very loosely) never feel coherent nor do they have any climax. They just wander until they drown into unbearable noodling. If you like this stuff you're probably better off with any Yngwie Malmsteen CD. This is DT at their absolute lowest - music without any purpose or direction that serves nothing more than contract fulfillment. Now excuse me while I put in my Opeth-CD..."
2,"Everyone has their bad days, I guess","First, let me say that I am a DT fan since ""Images and Words"". They are one of the few bands playing that gives me some hope that the industry can recognize talent once in a great while. Being this is a DT album, I had tremendous expectations when I first started listening to this CD.Unfortunately, history will probably record this effort as their collective low point. The album is good, but it is not up to DT quality. Take the first disc and use it as a coaster for your beverage. Sip on it while you enjoy the second disc. Not, that it is a masterpeice, either. The whole album has the feel of a band which came in the studio each morning trying to wing it. Confident that their sheer technical talent would carry the day.I can only hope that fan comments will force them to go back to the studio to correct this study in mediocrity. This is the surest way to erode a loyal fan base. Better luck next time around, guys. Until then, I'm still a fan."
4,I love the OVERTURE!,"Yeah, I love that Overture thingy they got goin' here. The more bombastic the better imho. I think it's very creative, familiar and just all around wierd and wonderful. A full symphony it is. I know some fans of DT don't dig this part of the lp, but I think it's one of the highlights. The rest of the music is great as well. And I have always liked Labrie's voice and think he is perfect for DT. Sometimes a bit over the top, but always a pleasure to my ears."
3,"4 Great ""songs"", and a lot of filler",I can 't make long pithy statements about the musicality or meaning of it all. I was just disappointed. It would be entirely possible for these guys to put 8 9-minute songs on a CD and melt your ears. I want them to do that. I think people would come running. I will buy their CD's if for only two simple reasons: the changes and number of notes keep you hopping.
1,Dream (Hey everyone....listen to how great we are)Theater,"What ever happened to the integrity of a song?Don't get me wrong...... These guys are WICKED musicians, but they are so involved with trying to show us how good they can play their instruments, that they forget about the song as a whole!!!Try listening to Rush, including their latest, Vapor Trails to hear how it's done right"
2,Six Degrees of a big let down,"... I was extremely disappointed with this album. Come on Dream Theatre you can do better than this. While the album has its good points (which are so few I can hardly remember any of them), the majority of it stinks. I can't believe that I payed good money for this garbage. I sure hope that their next album will be better than this. Harrison was right when he told me not to buy this record, maybe now I'll go listen to the Beatles. In case you are looking for a good album that is better than this, get Magical Mystery Tour, it's very psychadelic."
1,What happened!!!,"I ve been a Dream Theater fan from the begaining, but this is a big let down to see this talented band go in this direction. On the second CD I thought I was listening to a Disneyland theme...I believe when the band came up with these songs, they didn't have any of the fans in mind--a totally selfish experimental disaster. I hope they can recover from this aweful product in the future and I know there are many other DT fans shocked as well. The talent is there in every song, but the way it was implemented was terrible. Lord, please forgive them!"
5,"Like a vampire near the neck, this album will give you chills!","This is one of Dream Theater's greatest. Disc one is more of a Train of Thought type metal sound. (I know, Train of Thought came after) Disc two is my favorite. The songs blend seamlessly together and it listening to one track is impossible. You will want to hear them all in a row after hearing one. Just a great album all around!"
2,A sad turn down after Metropolis 2,"Metropolis 2 was so a great album.A big dissapointment I encounter myself with after hearing this one. The track of Disc 2 and the first song of Disc one had their highs, but thats it. I hope DT don't fall again into infinity."
3,Middle of the road,"Although there are good moments, this album cannot measure up to ""Scenes from a memory"" on a lyrical front, or ""Awake"" on a musical front. Both the lyrics AND the music seems ""forced"". The lyrics don't seem to have a flow (not every song has to have a catchy line, but once in a while would be nice). Musically, it always seems that right when the music gets into a steady state, it is immediatly broken off into hyperbeat rifts. This gets pretty distracting, especially on a 2 CD set.Like others have mentioned, they whole ""insanity"" theme album has been beaten into the ground by other bands.That said, the sheer talent of this band makes it an enjoyable album, just not up to the high bar they already set."
3,"I'm a huge fan, but this album was so so...","Like Queensryche's Operation mindcrime, Dream Theater out did themselves with Scenes from a Memory. And like Queensryche's Empire album after Mindcrime. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is okay...but not as good as Metropolis pt2.I'll keep it short, the album is good, I'm glad I got it. But it's a fair addition to their discography.I had the same feeling with Blind Guardian's A Night at the Opera. It was okay, but not as good as their previous album."
2,A Wait Not Worth the Wait,"Unlike the powerful musical genius of ""Awake"" and ""Falling into Infinity"" this is a release that definitely doesn't follow suit. There are few instrumental runs that are remniscent of the progressive intensity that Dream Theater is renowned for. Most songs don't commit themselves to memory even after continual re-play; the lyrical content reinforces the stale ""insanity"" theme that has been ""done to death"" by other artists. Engineering and production are mastered to the usual Dream Theater perfection -- but artistic musical passion and driving force are noticeably absent. The two CD-set could have been ""spliced down"" to a more memorable single CD."
5,Simply amazing,"In the short time that I've had to listen to this disc, I'd have to say that this is by far their most ambitious effort to date. The best way that I can describe the music is dense. There are so many different things going on at the same time that I'm absolutely in awe. Everyone is in great form from the first chords of The Glass Prison. The addition of Jordan on the keys is the best move these guys have ever made.If you're new to Dream Theater, this is an excellent place to start. If you're a long time fan, this album will likely not leave your player for some time to come."
1,Not sure how to say it...,"This double studio CD is the worst effort from Dream Theater I've seen. You would be better off burning the 26 dollars you might spend on this. The lyrics are poorly written and make tired subjects (even ""The Great Debate"") seem even more tiresome. The music on all of the tracks (except ""The Glass Prison"") reeks of synthesized orchestral sounds used in only the most trite ways conceivable. When the music does get away from the awful Trent-Gardner-esque synthesiser mess, it is merely a repetitive, goal-less rehash of the last few Dream Theater CDs. And for Christ's sake, Portnoy lists himself as playing ""Lead Drums"" in the booklet. Do yourself a favor, buy another copy of Awake and hope they never play any of this stuff live."
2,Overhyped boredom just filling a slot,"This double CD is a major disappointment. I don't know why, but I do tend to agree with some of the reviewers who said that DT was trying to branch out and go mainstream. I don't see anything on this album going into the radio charts. ... There are some highlights on this however... disc 1 isn't all bad... it's actually pretty good. ""Glass Prison"" is a cool song with great musicianship and a kind of Metallica or new Megadeth feel. ""Blind Faith"" is the most typical Dream Theater sounding track on the album so it's also quite good as well. Next comes ""Misunderstood"" which is also pretty well written and a more sombre sounding effort, followed by ""The Great Debate"", a song about stem cell research with a definite Tool sound ... All in all the first CD isn't bad. ..."
5,Best Dream Theater album!,"I will be honest with you, I did not like this album when I first heard it. In fact, I wanted to smash it with a baseball bat, but I do believe everything deserves a second chance. When I listened to this album again I was completely floored by the agressive manner in which the band was playing. This album is heavy and immensely dark. I don't care if the songs are 30 minutes each, this band pulls out all the stops with this album. From epic songs to more straight-forward progressive metal songs, Dream Theater did a fine job of constructing all of the songs. By far better, to me anyway, than anything they have done. For those of you who enjoy extremely dark progressive metal then ""Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence"" will be an outstanding addition to your music collection. Oh, and guitarist John Petrucci absolutely rips on this album (as usual)."
3,"""Portnoy & Petrucci: a Tribute to a Decade of Alternative""","I don't understand these guys. Why the hell do they need Jordan Rudess, John Myung and James LaBrie for? Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci produced the album, wrote most of the lyrics and most of the music while the other guys were set aside as Jason Newsted was in Metallica. When you listen to the first six songs (disc 1) it seems that Petrucci and Portnoy are playing alone, with brief collaborations from Rudess, Myung and LaBrie. It's all heavy guitars and drums. Until you decide to put CD2 on your CD player you don't know if the whole band is there. I guess Rudess and LaBrie are in there only for the paycheck and Myung tries to be a second Jason Newsted, but these people could have done better if they really wanted to. Also, I didn't like the new sound, it reminds me too much of Pantera, Metallica, Tool and Korn. This album should have been titled: ""Portnoy & Petrucci: a tribute to a decade of alternative rock"""
3,Mixed Feelings,"What a dilemma! Absoutely great intrumental work but can't these guys hear the incongruities between the instrumental genius and the mechanical, assembly-line vocals? I'm sure James Labrie is a nice guy, but his voice lacks the emotional and dramatic sophistication of the rest of the band (he seems way more comfortable and in his own element on his two ""Mullmuzzler"" solo projects). He is certainly technically proficient (and, in fairness, this effort is better than his singing on Metropolis II), but his style is just too contrived and plastic. Maybe Mike could take over. Or, maybe Ty Tabor could do some vocal tracks (check out Platypus's two CD's). Or better still, give Jon Anderson a call or even Geddy Lee...Lenny Kravitz?...Corey Glover? Anyhow, The instrumental part of the CD gets a solid FIVE STARS! Unfortunately the vocals only get one. Overall then, a generous three stars. Worth the cash though, so give it go."
2,Not worth the money.,"This is not a CD for true Dream Theater fans. For everyone who remebers the good ol days of ""Images"" and ""Awake,"" this album falls way short. The cd has a few moments, but not enough to justify ownership. The band sacrafices much needed melodie for Pantera style riffs and self-indulgent soloing. What I have come to appreciate about the band -- strong melodies, nice grooves, and the utmost of musicianship -- is all but completely missing in this current installment. This CD doesn't represent true progressive music, that which DT has epitomized in the past. Very disappointed."
2,Ehhh...,"A double album that someone should have picked through for good songs and made one album from. For me Dream Theater are completely hit and miss. This is a terrible miss. Its still got a few good moments. My problem with Dream Theater is that I wish they were instrumental. Their song writing is mediocre at best and I really don't care for most of mister LeBrie's vocals. Of course, prog rock is full of people who can't quite sing good enough for the rest of the music.In this case, the whole second CD album is so cheesy it sucks. The first CD is ok, but tries to be more than bad prog-metal and fails. Sometimes they try to be Tool. Sometimes they try to be someone else. Dream Theater should try to be themselves more. Its at those moments such, as in Metropolis, that they really shine and the reason I will always give them a listen when they make something new."
4,A Strange CD,"This CD sounds like a bizarre mix between Geddy Lee's solo album, Anthrax, Queensryche, and Zelda videogame music. The first disc sounds nothing like Dream Theater. If they're exploring new grounds, they better return to record pieces like the second disc, which is very good. It's a good CD, though I recommend you see them live. The experience is incredible."
5,Long awaited and well worth it!,"I put on my headphones last night and was prepared to be inpressed. I wasn't let down. DT has released another great album full of rich music and intense lyrics.It begins as ""Metropolis Pt:2"" ends; with static. This cd actually sounds a lot heavier and ""thicker"" than their earlier efforts. a must buy for any DT fan and a great place to start off with for a newbie to DT."
5,It's Dream Theatre....nuff said!,"Not going to get verbose on this. Disc one is dark, musically and lyrically. as a friend of mine put it, ""they have finally done away with the niceties"" on this one. Disc two is excellent as well. If anything, LaBrie's voice is best on this effort because he isn't dwelling in the high end of his register. Looking forward to catching these cats in March in New York.Go get the disc(s)!"
2,not the best DT- at all- not even that good,Tie for Crap place -- this and train of thought! who wins?!?! both losers!!!!!!!
4,Everyone listen,"This album had it's ups and downs, but who is to really tell how a band should play. Either you like it or you don't. I liked it. I didn't like scenes from a memory. The thing is, it is still a musicians piece of artwork, and who are we to tell an artist how he should do his art. I think that any album this band put out is their heart-felt feelings. How can you tell them what they should or shouldn't feel. Let them go do their thing. If you don't like it, don't buy it!"
5,Great follow-up to Scenes From A Memory.,"It's not quite as good but it's still amazing. It's very different than their last and it's way heavier than their last 2 albums, sounds similar to Awake in a few songs. It's very progressive, experimental and diverse. The 1st disc has some of their heaviest work to date, while the 2nd disc is more melodic and it's one long song with 8 parts. It's one of their best albums to date and I'd recommend it."
4,Better that SFaM,"First of all let's face it , they are not going to make another I&W or another Awake, and that's OK. because they already did these albums. I give this album 4.3 points , it's far better from Scenes from a Memory , and they are trying to mix the new wave of hard music but stay in their prog-vein, maybe the kings of 90' prog metal are the inventors of the prog-metal of this new century (in a good sense). The album is good and has in one song ( song 6 ) double better moments than in the entire SFaM. Disk one in good but different, kind of ethereal , which is good , if they had made another Awake it wouldn't be progressive.Being a HUGE fan of this band this is my third Choice after I&W and Awake.. hey , even James does not annoy me !! :)"
3,Got the CD because of disc 2,"As a DT fan this was a must for me, as well as any other future DT album. From previous experiences you just know that DT is incapable of writing a [bad music]. Anyways...since I got this CD I haven't taken out disc #2 from my player, DT did their usual work on that song: complex rhythm and very elaborate harmony, specially at the end of the 4th movement when after a great progression of three augmented chords, the guitar solo resolves into a great acoustic riff on movement #5. Disc #1 is just like Falling into Infinity, with songs that are not really ""that"" incredible. In case you're a TRUE DT fan just get the CD, with disc 2 you will be satisfied, but WE all know that Theater has not produced anything close to Images & Words in quite sometime. Enjoy!"
4,Does the job,"I make novelty signs and real estate signs and was using a drill press to put holes in my steel and aluminum signs. The drill press was messy and cumbersome to use and would leave burrs around the permimeter of the hole. I found this tool by Anytime Tools on Amazon and figured I'd give it a try as it wasn't expensive. It does a good job. I haven't owned it long enough to speak to it's longevity, but it does the job that I bought it for. No more metal shavings to clean up from the drill press and the quality of the finished product (my signs) is better as well. Money well spent."
2,Weak,"This cd is in the corner growing dust mites. I have had it for awhile and tried my hardest to get into it. It bores me to tears. The vocals are absolutely pathetic. For a ""top notch"" death metal band, Chimera fails to impress me. The music is spattered all over the place, making it a big heap of crap and a mundane listen. Die hard Mayhem fans will enjoy this, but that's about it."
5,"Dimmu Borgir style lyrics, but exceptional music","Not what I expected from Mayhem, especially the lyrics (if you can read them).Had to listen to this CD many times before the music became somewhat catchy.Found that it is actually possible to sing along with this one after a while.Seems Mayhem have turned Dimmu Borgir when it comes to lyrics and digipack cover art.So relieved the music is far better than Dimmu."
5,An Album in a Sea of Singles,I am not a big music afficianado but this is just an outstanding album. I do not even care for rock and roll but Mrnorth has a unique sound and its arranged so well.
4,Bayesian Inference and Decision,This is definitely useful for someone going for an MBA or other managerial degree. I would not have been able to do my class assignment without it. I am taking a graduate course in Statistics and this reference may help me achieve an A.
3,Small steel dog bowl,"The title of the product suggests it's a dog grooming device, but it's actually a small dog bowl. Works fine as a travel or outdide bowl of water. It's smaller than I expected, but it's made of a good quality stainless steel and hasn't rusted."
4,Just buy the whole CD,"Talk Show, for those of you who don't already know, is the Robert and Dean DeLeo and Eric Kretz of Stone Temple Pilots, along with singer David Coutts filling the shoes of 'former' frontman Scott Weiland. While, admittidly, Coutts' vocal skills are marginally lower than Weiland's, his wide range and lush lyricism make Talk Show's self-titled release a listining joy.Hello Hello has to have the best riff on the CD, sounding more than a little like a Jimmy Page riff. The vocals are catchy on this song, but it was not the best choice for a single. Ring Twice or Morning Girl would have been better, and may have recieved more radio airplay. But Hello Hello teemed up with End of the World gives an excellent sampler of the Talk Show CD. However, why waste your money on 2 songs when you can recieve the other 10 for only a few dollars extra? If you enjoyed Stone Temple Pilots' release Tiny Music, or the softer tracks from the new Shangri-La-Dee-Da, check this out."
3,3 of the stories were not that good,"Iliked Alan Mendelsohn and Slaves of Spiegel. They were great books. However, I did not like the other three."
3,The book is too big for this age group,Each one of these books is an excellent choice for the Middle School age group. But most children in this age range will not attempt a book this size (approx 650 pages.) I would suggest getting one or more of these books individually.
5,the love-child of Robin Williams and Garrison Keillor?,"I first read Mr. Pinkwater's wonderful comedy when an excerpt of Hoboken Fish and Chicago Whistle appeared in Funny Times magazine. I laughed through the whole thing, and then showed it to everyone I know. Those who didn't laugh I dropped like hot potatoes!Protagonists are most often intelligent junior high-ish boys who don't quite fit in at school and have rather odd relatives (though sympathetic females and adults also make appearances). And while these books may be just the magic to get your pre-adolescent son reading, don't make the mistake of thinking these books are limited to that demographic. The author is creative, inventive, outrageous, charming and sweet, and anyone who appreciates outrageous invention and smart-alecky humor will love the work of this very talented author.I can't wait to read more books by Mr. Pinkwater, and am very happy to see his books are being reissued."
5,The Last Guru,"I read this book many years ago and wanted to buy it for my kids. I am so happy that it's back in print! It's one of the funniest, most insightfully sarcastic reviews of the sixties there are. Thank you Mr. Pinkwater!"
5,AMAZING!!,"I have had this book for 4 years. I bring it everywhere I go. Every trip, I have it packed, along with maybe 4 Fantastic novels (also by Pinkwater). This is brilliant. All I can add is BUY THIS BOOK!! you will not regret it."
1,Poor Seat Cushions,I was not pleased with this purchase. The cusions are hard and you can feel what I call the springs in the cusions. I did not return them as I used them for a different purpose. I cut them in half and used them under our pation cushions. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THEM AGAIN.
2,artic cool king,"cheap, will not last a summer. held in place by elastic back strap, seat will slide around"
1,Uncomfortable,"Not a good product, very uncomfortable. Ended up tossing it. I was hoping it was like the old ones they used to sell back in the 70's that were actually comfortable and cool on those old vinyl seats - not the case with this product."
1,PURE GARBAGE,I bought this thinking it would replace a worn out one I had for about 7 years. I used it ONE DAY and the front seam came apart and continued to unravel from that point on. Within that first day I must have gotten in and out of my vehicle about 20 times. I would have thought this thing would last more than a day. I noted this to the vendor and still (about a month later) have not heard from them either.. Must have been made in CHINA or MEXICO.. I am sorry I bought it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.....
2,too soft,lasted a few months and began to crumple under use. edges are not ridgid enough to hold up in use in and out of a car repeatedly
1,Really junk,"This product is by far the WORST example of an air cushion EVER!!!The so called coils, what a joke! If this can keep air circulating, your butt and back must be about 3 inches wide, and you must weigh no more than 5 lbs! Good Luck with that.I should have listened to the reviews.I called the company for a Return Number, and was given one, but after I reviewedtheir return policy, I would be spending WAY TOO MUCH, with their restocking, pain taking them back to the Post Office, shipping charges already spent once, so I did keep them, but they really are junk."
1,poorly made,"works well till it falls apart, the one i had lasted less than two weeks, the vender should be ashamed of them selves"
4,works well,My Vet really believes in these drops and I've noticed a bit of an extra kick in the senoirs that I give it to.
5,A perfect book,"This is the most beautiful, brilliant Christmas book I have ever seen. It is for all ages, not just 4-8. Sabuda pays attention not just to how the pop-up image looks when the page is open, but also to the way in which the image emerges. The simplicity of images, use of color, and imagination all combine to make this a perfect book."
3,The 12 Days of Fail - 12 lords do not leap...,"Anybody else have an edition that from 8 maids a milking the whole book is wrong? Mine has 9 drummers drumming instead of ladies dancing, etc. Good book. Beautiful. I would like my kids to know the actual words however.FAIL"
5,"If it says ""Sabuda/Reinhart"" on it, buy it!","These guys are amazing, if you're a grownup and haven't seen one of these guys' popup books you are in for a treat. The Christmas books make great coffee table books during the Holiday season."
5,Heirloom Book,"This is the most wonderful Christmas book I have seen! The intricate detail and whimsey are more than I could have imagined. And when the tree popped up and the lights twinkled, I could not believe it. Robert Sabuda must be a genius. I will keep this book with my most treasured Christmas items."
5,Another great Sabuda book,"I already had this book myself, but I purchased multiple copies to give as Christmas gifts this year. I think they were very well received. I have all of Sabuda's pop up books and this one fits in nicely. If you like Sabuda's books, you'll love this one. If you don't have any of his books yet, this is a nice one to start with."
2,12 Days of Christmas Anniversary Edition,"The book was listed as ""new."" Unfortunately, the book had a great deal of wear and the ornament that should have been incluede was not."
2,Put together quickly and messily!,"Let me first say that I did NOT purchase my copy through Amazon. I did, however, purchase from a reputable merchant. I carefully looked through our copy. We have several of Sabuda's other books and they're excellent, so I knew the quality to expect. This copy had spots where the color was transferred to other pages and what seemed like glue was showing in various places throughout. The main disappointment, however, was the Christmas tree on the last page. We opened it carefully, but it was not possible to fold the page back down to close the book! We had several adults try and no one could close the book!This appeared to be an effort to rush through to get the volume out in time for Christmas. Very disappointing. It COULD have been another beautiful volume of Sabuda's!"
5,Wonderful!,Sabuda's pop-ups are truly magnificent. I bought this as a present for a youngster who will appreciate it more as the years go on. I know that the book will be a family treasure for a long time.
4,Great Gift,Amazing pop ups illustrating the 12 days of Christmas. Great gift for a grandparent to share with the young ones.
1,Terrible...,"Decidedly myopic and one-sided, the author's primary interest seems to be debasing the subject entirely using unsubstantiated rumors and dubious source material. There are far better, even-handed treatments available - look for the excellent ""David Bowie: An Illustrated Record"" by Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray. Crudely sensationalist at its best, and outright slanderous at its worst, Sanford's book would be at more at home amongst the supermarket tabloids than any thinking person's library. Absolutely terrible."
1,confusing,"Yes, there's lots of info here, but the way the author explains Bowie's career is confusing. He starts talking about an album, then he goes back in time, then he presses the fast forward button, only to return to that specific album... And very rarely he explains the year he's talking about. I had to keep looking on wikipedia for the release dates.When writing about specific songs, he seems to enjoy what I consider the weakest tracks of each album.The kind of language he uses makes it also not fun to read, with lots of strange, pedantic words. I CONSTANTLY read Rock & Roll books, and I don't think I ever had such a feeling.And to make things worse, I got the Spanish version of the book, with a different (totally uncool) cover."
5,"The best from Point of Grace since their ""Free to Fly"" record","I managed to get a copy early. I've listened to all the songs four times. This record is the best from P-O-G since ""Free to Fly"" in 2001, and that has been a long time! My top picks are: Way You Live, All the World, Any Way and You Are Good. For great harmony, there is Track 12, Before the Throne of Grace. This production reminds us that great artists need great songs if the record is to be great. Why don't we recognize the song writers more?"
5,Beautiful Music,The songs and voices raised in God's glory...wonderful. The CD arrived quickly and the music has comforted my soul. I strongly recommend others to listen to these artists.
5,Best album yet,"This is the best album yet by Point of Grace. Not only is their music easy to listen you, it ministers to your soul. This music clearly honors God and that is what makes it so good. Definitely a five-star effort."
2,"Terry, Please Come Back","Doesn't everyone miss the old Point of Grace? My wish for 2008 is that Terry will come back, and this once GREAT group will go back to the music that made them outstanding. If any of the members of POG and especially Terry read this, please pray for guidance."
2,"No, it's not HOW you live","Does anyone review (or even listen) to anything but the ""sound"" of a song anymore? Doesn't anyone listen to lyrics? The lyrics of ""How You Live"" by Point of Grace are very sweet, but it is not always sweet to follow Christ. The song is decidedly NOT Christian, but it states that your lifestyle is what is important.How You LiveFor a Christain, the important thing IS ""who"" you know - that being Jesus Christ. HOW we live is not ""it"" for a follower of Christ. His teachings and life all focus on the fact that we cannot win our salvation by our own works. ""It is by grace you have been saved,"" St. Paul sates in Ephesians 2:5. Apparently Paul was not referring to the ""Point of"" variety.HOW we live is only a result of the power of His sacrifice for us on the cross."
1,Nothing spectacular,"The music is annoying, it's hard to understand the lyrics, and it almost seems as if they are just doing this to make money. A few of the songs sound okay...but most of them are just kind of noisy or boring.If you just want something to listen to, fine...but if you are looking for music that actually brings you into the presence of God you need to go for Karen Wheaton, Karen Peck or Mike Purkey."
4,Great light for the price,"I tend to ride between 15 - 20mph on my 8 mile commute. This light is powerful enough and has a wide enough beam for me to ride safely at that speed at night. It's also very compact. My commute leads me through an urban area that's well lit and a country area that's very dark, and it does the job well in both areas. I like the fact that it has a hi and low setting so I can adjust it as needed. I also like the fact that it takes regular AA batteries because I can use rechargeables and save $$."
5,Beautiful!!,"I teach fourth grade and use this book every year to teach writing. I use it as an introduction on writing a descriptive essay on a place that is special to the child. I also use it to teach similes and metaphors. The children love this book and they really seem to ""get it"" when I point out the vivid descriptions and the similes and metaphors. The language in the book is just beautiful. It is one of my all time favorite children's books!"
5,High Marks for Both Text and Illustrations,"This book is not easy to find but is an excellent overview of world mythologies with beautiful illustrations. It contains 21 chapters devoted to the various mythologies of the world from ancient Greece and Rome, to Norse, Celtic, and other European, as well as Asian and American cultures. The illustrations are primary high quality reproductions of museum paintings that might justify the cost of the book on their own for many. The text provides comprehensive summaries of all of the major stories and legends. A wonderful gift for anyone interested in mythology and a essential addition to your own home reference library."
1,blurry and hurts my eyes,I don't know but this does not look digitally remastered. It's so blurry that we could not watch it for even a minute without getting a headache. Rip off and waste of $$. Sorry I bought it. If I could I could give it a 0 rating.
3,old westerns,"These were great dvd's for my Dad who watched them till he was 90 years old, but the sound quality was difficult for him. I recommend them for people that love old westerns."
2,Works well until it breaks,We bought one of these blenders and really liked the way it blended frozen drinks until it just completely died. We thought it was a fluke so we bought another one. That one worked really well until it broke as well. Same problem - again completely dead. The motor just can't seem to handle frozen drinks very well.
5,Herbert George Wells,"The Time Machine DVDThe feature that I find fascinating about this movie is that it is directed by the Great Grandson of the author, Herbert George Wells. It was was the first major novelThe Time Machine (Signet Classics)written by H. G. Wells in 1875, I believe. The Time Machine has been the basis for numerous time- travel novels to the point that it is a staple in Science Fiction today.I strongly recommend this movie for fans of Science Fiction and H. G. Wells (Do you think Bush 41 was named after him?Gunner, March, 2008"
5,"Ladies and Gents,","I simply must add my voice to the crowd in this case.Rasputina is an absolute must for anyone with any kind of taste for truly unique music.This album, though rare, thus pricey, contains many utterly essential songs and some stunning art.Don't hesitate."
4,thank the gods for rasputina,"excellent excellent excellent - I bought this CD and listened to it for a few days straight. The New Zero, naturally, is wonderful, and I can't stop listening to The Old Headboard...Dwarf Star, though, I could really do without...."
5,Seperate but Equal :),"I was extremely happy with this album. It's not ""Ether"" mind you, but a much more rock-oriented CD, incorporating guitars and drums into many of the songs. Some of the songs that really stick out are: The New Zero, *a cryptic love song* Herb Girls of Birkenau, *A haunting song about holocaust victims* and How We Quit the Forest. I promise you will not be dissapointed with this great album!!!"
5,TrenchMouth is worth the price of this CD,"I think that ""How We Quit The Forest"" should be the first CD for anyone interested in Rasputina. It contains what I think are the greatest songs that they have written. I am more into songs that rock, so for me the two best songs on this CD are ""The Olde HeadBoard"" and definitely ""TrenchMouth""! TrenchMouth is a great song besides all the hype about it all being played on cello (which is cool by itself). Definitely a band to develop a crush on."
5,"Incredible music: lyrics, arrangement, music, vision. An inspired distinct relentless ultra female turned on sensibility","Raputina came by my town - Burlington VT -and I thought I'd take my teen aged singer daughter to check them out. I was knocked out. References from Kodaly to Phillip Glasss to Led Zepellin. The lyrics give Patti Smith and Leonard Cohen a big run for their money. So creative, different and accomplished. Listen all the the time to this album and saving nickels, dimes and whalebone to trade in for the others. D. Schein"
5,completely intoxicating,the most fantastic piece of art the world yet has to offer. the entrancing melodies take you to other place entirely. though not recommended if you are the depressive sort.
2,Does not release consistently,The retention device does not consistently release the trigger guard when drawing. I would not trust my life to this holster...so I returned it.
3,"Clever songs, clever words","The songs are on this CD are sung by each actress, more or less establishing her take on her position in the world. Some of the songs are very clever. A must for the fans of the movie."
4,Scofield Study Bible,I must admit that if I had more choices of a study Bible in the ESV then I would not have chosen the Scofield study Bible. The binding and overall texture are fine and Scofield teaches sound doctrine but it's the content or rather lack of it. The setback is there are not that many study notes. A couple of better choices if version is not an issue would be the NIV study Bible or the Life Application Study Bible.
4,"Excellent, educational book and DVD","I really liked the first half of the DVD, but didn't think the second 1/2 of the DVD was really necessary for someone to watch. I appreciated learning about the health benefits of eating a plant-based diet and have done a good job transitioning my eating habits.I recommend this book highly, but skip that last part of the DVD."
5,This message is *SO VERY CRUCIAL* for every human being....,"that after having just watched the dvd, I ordered the book and a set for each family member. Not only that, I'm changing my diet immediately. I'd already stopped eating meat, eggs and dairy for animal welfare issues - but now I'll know how (and why) to do it far better. And I want to devote every dollar and spare minute I can to promote this message for the rest of my life. I suppose an amazon.com review is a good place to start. Truly a Godsend. Please order this item, greatly improve your life, and share it with EVERYONE you can!"
5,The Rave Diet & Lifestyle,"The RAVE Diet & LifestyleIt's important for everyone to know the impact of the choices they make. Our choices affect our health and the wellbeing of people all over the world.We need to be made aware of the impact of our choices. The video that accompanied the book was very informative.The book would be good for people who are interested in taking control of their health, and for people who would like to help make the world a better place."
4,life changing,"The lesson learned from the book and video had such an impact,I know I will be forever different in my eating habits.The 2 month effect has been startling!"
5,A new way of life for me,This book has really heightened my interest in diet. Living on a dairy farm for many years I was accustomed to eating dairy and animal products as my main courses. WOW! What a turnaround I have made after reading the book. The DVD that is included is one that has really captured my attention! A must read for anyone who is concerned about his/her health!!!
2,Poor quality facsimile,"This is a reprint of a facsimile published in the late 19th century. The quality of the photographs is poor (italic passages are especially hard to read). In places it is obvious that the original photographer 'touched up' the prints presumably because the photographs did not come out well; in particular, one page in The Winter's Tale appears to have several lines written by hand. I'm glad that someone has at last made available a paperback facsimile and this book is OK to have if you're just curious, but for any serious work it is not to be recommended."
2,Illegible reproduction,"You will not be able to read this facsimile without a magnifying glass: the printing is illegible in substantial parts. Of course it is good to skip the scholars' conflated versions and read the folio, but this is impossible in this terribly bad reproduction."
4,Cute...much like Starman Jones,"My first science fiction book was Starman Jones (excellent book for all you early, early teenagers). This reminded me of that, but with far more science and less coming-of-age. Generally not a bad book, but not his best."
3,"Agree with others, teen book","I enjoyed it but I have to agree with other reviews, it is a book for children or teens."
3,Enya,"I first heard this groups music at a friends Thanksgiving gettogether. Andmaybe because my friends family and me too are all of Irish/Scottish ancestry?there was something about Enya music that really appealed to me. But nowI bought quite a few CD's and even some sheet music, but I tired of it prettyquickly-for some reason, and don't much care for it now."
4,RAD- can you really help it heal?,"Achieving success is a good book to give out to relatives and other caregivers who really have no clue about living with your ""little darling"". It is easy to read, not too technical or boring, gives the general information on the disorder, and does give some ideas of how to deal with the child. The best thing is that he has lived with these kids and at least can understand where you are coming from.If you are new to the research on RAD it might help you. If you have read and researched and have one of those kids that just won't make it in your home it can give you another perspective on residential treatment and therapeutic homes."
3,Erotic read,"There is a lot of sex scenes. This story kept my interest thru the whole story. Skye is a female wolf that has everything except she can't change into a wolf. She has to male bond mates,One Vamp and one human. She meads out justice. A good read."
3,Good read,"When I see Ellora's Cave across the top of a book I tend to shy away from them. My bad experiences out weigh the good ones. BUT Jory Strong is one author that I will read.This author does a good job developing characters, creating interesting plot lines, and writing main characters that interest. It is erotica, but there is also a developed storyline that involves intrigue, violence, and mystery. Contemporary yet paramornal. Its the story about missing teens, vampires, and the club that stick in my mind after finishing the book. I liked Skye and even though the conclusion was solid, I am left wondering about her past. Hopefully the next book will cover that off.Other 3 star and higher reviews covered the plot highs/lows in detail."
3,Women like this make me ill-but the book itself was good,"I have mixed feelings about this book; while it is well written and interesting (I love true crime), I became increasingly angry and finally lost interest because of the Barbara and her incredible inability to see reality; Richard Minns beat her up;she saw how he lied and manipulated to get what he wanted and SHE COULDN'T LEAVE HIM- Puh-lease---I usually have a degree of empathy with a character who is treated badly but not this one; She is very lucky she isn't dead---I am also disappointed that justice in this case did not prevail and that weasel sociopath got away with his crime"
4,Very good guide to getting to the good stuff,"I'm a ballpark addict. For as long as I can remember, I've loved reading about them and visiting. From barely there relics like what remains of League Park in Cleveland to new marvels such as CitiField in Queens, no feeling can match going to one of baseball's hallowed grounds.I happened upon this book without knowing about it and it seemed right up my alley, so I made an impulse buy. Three years later, I still refer to it constantly when I travel to a new park and use it to find things I otherwise might not. This book has that covered, in spades. Well written, albeit a bit disjoined.My biggest gripe is that it's a bit out of date now. If they updated information about new parks, I'd be there on Day 1 to get a new copy. Maybe a few more pictures would be nice, as well.If you plan on hitting the road and visiting some new parks, consider this the only travel guide you need!"
1,How do you trash the Dodger Dog?,"After skimming through this book and finding out a lot of interested information, the most suprising was the trashing of the famous Dodger Dog hot dog these guys made.Folks, if you're heading to Dodger stadium (and I am by no means a Dodger fan), I reccommend 3 dodger dogs, or 2 foot longs if you're feeling sassy.The Fenway Frank and the DD are probably the two most talked about dogs in the MLB, and I've had both - the Dodger Dog blows the Fenway Frank right out of the water."
5,"Fine sieves--too""fine"" for me?","Good quality sieves delivered fairly promptly. I use them for sieving fossiliferous silt from the Shwrktooth Hill bone bed, and the smaller screens are finer than I need. Maybe I should've gotten the set with fewer screens... Anyway, they work very well, and I am quite pleased with their performance."
5,Scaredy Cat Takes a Chance,"My in-laws bought this recently for my 3.5 year old daughter. When my husband & I first saw it we thought, ""Oh No."" Our daughter is the ultimate scaredy cat. She is scared of every ride on toy. When no one was looking, so she thought, she gave it a try. She has not stopped riding it since. It is the perfect size for a 3 year old and very easily maneuverable. It is a great preschooler scooter."
5,beautiful music,"This album was fantastik! I can't believe they didn't promote this product better. We should have seen much more of this artist. The lyrics are romantic, yet sexy. The music (MIami Symphonic Orchestra, Ed Calles-Sax, Manny Benito, Hal Batt, Luis F, Ochoa, producers) was phenomenal. There is a track that was recently remade by Olga Tañol entitled Asi Es La Vida which is great! Please amazon.com have more in stock to sell soon!"
2,keeps jamming,"I have had this printer for about 45 days. I would like to keep it but I am going to attempt to return it today because I can't deal with the constant paper jamming. I have tried different stock paper but have not had success. Removing the jammed paper is laborious. On the positive side, it does connect niceley to a home network and you can use it to print from either a wired or wireless computer. Photo printing is ok."
5,nice board,"I got the ASUS A7N8X Deluxe V2.0 it is a lovely board , even with the same CPU, RAM and same Video Card I got over 400 increse on 3dMark 2k1 score..very nice board . fast and stable.. also a good complement ..the Soundstrom is amazin for it type.."
1,Not for Gameboy Advance SP,"Advert says works for all Gameboys including Gameboy Advance; unfortunately, does NOT work with Gameboy Advance SP, just as another reviewer noted. Misleading advertising."
1,Just didn't work,"This cable wouldn't link 2 Gameboy Advanced SP playing the same Pokemon game. I had to purchase a different Nintendo brand cable at Target and all worked fine with that cable. Not sure if the particular cable I got from Amazon was defective or if all the cables have a faulty design, but I just had to throw mine away, it was useless."
1,didn't meet my expectations,This product does not connect 2 Gameboy Advanced SP games of like kind. Unfortunately it is of no use to me.
2,Doesn't work,It says it works for game boy but it looks like a GBA cable. At least have it right and not falsely advertised. Not pleased at all.
1,the product didnt work...,"so when i got the link cable in the mail the first day i tried it it didnt work. but i shipped the product back and after a claim, was rembursed."
4,buffalo panoramic puzzle,At least this company sends puzzles with all the pieces! it was challenging with so much of the same colors but in the end a nice picture.
2,Wicked movie,"To tell the truth, I purchased this movie because my sister is one of the main characters. I guess I'm a little bias and can't really tell you if I laughed so much due to watching my sister or the cheesiness of the movie. Laughing probably isn't such a good thing since it's a horror movie. guess you'll just have to buy it and watch it yourself."
4,Read carefully,"Spence deserves his wide reputation as America's foremost China scholar. In this book (which I admit that I had to read for class) he tells of one of the most famous emporers from the Qing dynasty. Spence wrote this book using scraps and notes found from this era. Sometimes it's hard to see where the line is between hard fact and Spence's conjecture, however, given the quality of his other research, I'll trust his conjecture even if he doesn't always offer up the evidence to support it. Read it carefully though, so you know what's what."
5,A selection of songs that touch your heart and soul,"I became a christian in July of 1998, and 'Steady On' was the first christian cd I bought. Since then I have purchased all of their cd's. The songs move you, inspire you and renew your faith in a compelling way. My favorite songs are 'Steady On', 'My God' and most of all 'Who am I'. 'Who am I' reassures all of us, the magnicifent love He has for each of us. No matter what we do, how insignificant we feel, He is there and He loves us so much. I recommend this CD to new and old christians alike."
5,One of the best ever!,"Steady On is an excellent cd. It is comforting and encouraging, and I love the moderate pace of the songs. If all of their cd's are as good as this one, I'll have to get them all!"
2,What a wonderful tribute to our Lord.,This cd is a wonderful tribute to our Lord. It has touched my life dearly and will surely touch the lives of those who listen.
2,nice cd but a little nasally,"I have to agree with you sarah.bear, it is a good cd but their vioces sounded like they where singing through their noses. This really showed through on their song ""Steady on"". It is a good song though. But, they have to start sing through their mouths instead of through their noses. I would of gave them 5 stars if they wouldn't of sang through their noses."
5,"Wonderful album, wonderful ensemble","I'm a 42-year-old mom who first heard Point of Grace in concert at the 1998 Heritage Keepers Conference in Indianapolis. Their music and message reached across three generations that day. We have heard songs from this album sung by folks of all ages in our church. I enjoy listening to this one on cold, rainy days when I feel all alone. Each song here is a reminder that God really is with us, has a plan for us, and loves us no matter what's going on in the world. Keep the faith, everyone. . .and enjoy this elegantly crafted and produced body of work by four of the warmest, most dedicated ladies in CCM."
5,Touching songs,"This is a very nice CD to own. My favorite song is ""When the wind blows"". I cried when the first time I heard this song. This is the first song that well-expressed our hope and patience in waiting for Jesus to come back the second time for us. A wonderful CD to recommend."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,I just bought this CD yesterday and I love it. It is a different style for Point Of Grace but it's a great style and I love it.
2,"Talent there, but lacking in depth","If you are wondering why ""Contemporary Christian Music"" is such a joke to anyone outside the church.. one needs only listen to POG. Oh, the talent is there, these ladies can SING, and sing good. But the lyrics and music suffer. The words have been said a thousand times before, and paint life in a nutrasweet mix. The music is blatently aimed at those who listen to Christian AC Radio, and aimed at not rocking the boat. I'd love to hear these women sing some blues, some minor keys, entirely a capella, hymns (although they do a good job at rendering hymns). Anything but the same old song. Since CCM is aimed at the saved females, this stuff sells like hotcakes. If ""secular"" radio is Coke, this is diet-caffiene free Shasta."
3,"Good message, a couple of good songs...","Some of the songs on here are great... I loved Steady On, The Song is Alive, and Better Days. Once I cried when I heard When the Wind Blows because it touched me so much. But besides those, I haven't really listened to any of the songs more than once. All of them have wonderful messages, but I like music that has more rock in it than Steady On has to offer. If I could make my purchase over again, I would buy a different CD than Steady On."
2,Invincible Armour,"This is one of John Liu's best,however, what a pitty that there are 5 scenes that have been deleted and this does not make sense for me. I strongly do not want any one to buy this movie. I bought one and then returned it. If the original edition is being sold somewhere in a DVD edition, please let me know. Many thanks."
2,invincible armor not so invincible,"Man, did I waste my cash yet again on Wu Tang garbage. I thought I had found a movie I had been looking for for many years, but what I found was heartache. This entire series is a total grab bag. I've found excellent movies and I've found tripe. Well, maybe tripe is too nice a word.The fighting was fair at best; I think the director was more taken with the lead's ability to hold his foot straight up over his head. I don't even remember how many times they showed that stunt in the movie. The best thing about owning this video is the homo-erotic picture on the back of the protagonist searching for the bad guy's weak spot. Probably not worth the money, though."
1,Not very sturdy,"We received this basket and returned it right away, because not only did the basket get smashed during shipping but the handles fall in towards the baby's face. The depth of the basket also isn't as good as some of the other ones we looked at. While the interchangeable colored ribbons and cloth material is ok, it seems that the basket just isn't very sturdy. We later bought a Tadpoles basket and were happy with that one, even though the price was more."
3,Decent for the price,This is a decent moses basket for the price. It's definitely not a great one though. The handles are really stiff and flop into the basket.
5,Great for overnights! Great compliment to Kooshies diapers!,"I love these for the extra absorbancy. Now that my baby is a lttle bigger (I don't think it would work as for the itty bitty sized babies), I started to use them even with the newborn size folded in half in the front and am having much less leaking of urine on the overnight. They are a bit expensive, but worth it, as is the rest of the Kooshies line."
3,"Are these flushable, biodegradable? or do you wash them?","I can't rate them because I'm yet to use them. However, I also couldn't tell if you rinse the liner along with the diaper and throw in the washer or if these are best for those with a diaper service..."
5,Taste of Honey - Morgana King,"It is a shame that Morgana King's recordings are not more readily available. Ms.King has an incredible range and does things with her voice that most singers can only dream of. Her take on ""Lazy Afternoon"" is about as seductive as it gets. Originally released in the 1960s, the arrangements are lush and might seem to some a bit dated, but for the most part all of her renditions still stand up. Her vocal facility pulls you in, and you just want more. If you can find it, regardless of the medium - vinyl, tape or CD, get it. You won't be disappointed."
2,"Great singing, bad compilation","Anyone who really knows and LOVES the original album of this title will be quite disappointed after paying this amount , and not getting the original tracks/cuts as in 1964. Where is Lazy Afternoon, perhaps the best recorded version of this song???? Be aware, it is still fabulous singing, but not what you may be looking for."
1,A Taste of Honey,"You have got to be kidding. The last time I checked for availability of this CD it was being offered for a ""paltry"" $60. Now I see someone has the audacity to ask for almost $400. What a joke! I suspect he/she bought the $60 one and now is trying to make a quick profit. Well, good luck to you!Morgana King definitely is an aquired taste! I didn't pay the $60 asked for earlier it, and certainly will never pay this exorbitent amount being asked for now."
3,I'm guessing,"I've only heard ""...Not Gonna Take It' on Sirius Ch.25 (Garage) and it was sweet! Extremely Tough to find even with all the internet options available."
2,unaccepted book quality and wrong edition sent,"Dear Amazon books customer servicewhen I Made the order for this Book- Atlas of periodontal surgery- (Edward cohen, I was requesting an edition not older then 3 year(2007 or 2008). but you sent me a poor quality book of 1988 edition (too old).so i am not satisfied of this service really.and thanks"
1,Sucks BIG TIME!,"The cover bands suck, the versions suck, and the disk is poorly produced. Save your money unless it is in a bargain bin for a buck or two."
4,Bought the Ace; read the uncensored,"The uncensored 50th anniversary edition was quite good. I bought the Ace version not knowing about the 50th anniversary edition, so I bought then the latter and read it. I assume the Ace edition is almost as good."
3,It's Okay,"Hi Everybody.The strap is ok, but the color in the picture is dark than I received.Thanks a lot."
2,"It's just like Sonata Arctica, only not so good","I bought this CD under the pretense that it was just like Sonata Arctica, and it is-just not anywhere near as good. Every song sounds pretty much the same, and the title of the track is usually the chorus of the song, usually sung the same way too. This album is not very good at all. It's very repetitive and there is almost no variety of style between the songs. The only different song is the very last track, and that't only because it's instrumental. Don't buy this unless you are a really hardcore power metal fan."
4,hit the beach,great little selection of surf music. Nice and simple to listen to and a great break from the crap on the music scene nowadays
2,Surf Music,Does not do well at all in the digital cd system in my car. Sounds horrible. Needs remastering to conform to the new systems.
4,A cute quick read.,"I liked this book the characters were interesting, and it was funny at times. The romance was pleasant and innocent. I would reccomend this book."
5,Hawthorne does it again!,"I am a huge fan of Rachel Hawthorne, and Thrill Ride is my all time favorite book of hers. she did a great job with the characters, and i could really relate to megan being torn between her back home boyfriend, and her dreamy coworker parker. he was probably my favorite character of all, with his love of rollercoasters, funny personality, and kind heart. i reccomend this book for anyone, it was a great read."
4,Good fluffy teen read.,"I enjoyed this book... it was written at a nice pace, didn't get too bogged down into details OR move too fast. It's a good book for beach or poolside reading, when you just want to relax."
5,Love it... well built!!!,"I love these pans, they are elegant looking, and cook great. Easy to clean and care for."
1,Correct the Correction,"Sai Li's point was just what the ""Correction"" comment states: that current students did fill out the surveys. However, without any biographical information on them (sorry a list of names at the end of the book doesn't do a whole lot of good) and without knowing how those students were picked (i.e., whether they can be considered at all representative of their class and school), we are left not knowing how much weight, if any, should be given to their feedback. It appears as if the ""Correction"" review was simply an attempt by the author to increase the overall rating of the book by including an additional 5 star review. Pretty transparent, and I second Sai Li's recommendation to get your hands on the AAMC's MSAR book which is the only guide to medical schools officially sanctioned by the American Association of Medical Colleges."
5,A priceless read and a wake-up call to our soul,"This is the book that started it all for me--the magnificent obsession--Gnosis! When you read this book a funny thing will happen. You'll find that inner voice telling you, ""At last..now you know...welcome back...Isn't it wonderful...it all makes sense now"" This book will introduce you to yourself...as you were meant to know it! This is the book about our REAL HOME. This place where we spend 99.999999999 percent of our existence, otherwise known as eternity.I cannot measure the gratitude I feel towards God and Ms. Browne for re-introducing me to the spark of the Divine, the God, that I am. One forgets almost everything of The Other Side and who we are--for a purpose--when we come into life. You don't have to die now to find out who you are or where you came from--it's all here. You can start here or Sylvia's other similar work, The Other Side and Back, but do start! I promise you'll never be the same or see this world quite the same way again."
2,Is the supernatural so suburban?,"I must admit these are kinds of books which fascinate me - and when a friend buys one, I must read it also... even if only to tell her why it is such nonsense!So there is really no money to be made in telling readers that we all end at death and there is nothing else to say?Sylvia and Lindsay should at least be complimented on using a clear prose to tell us what we all want to hear!Their tone is friendly, which is pleasant and polite to readers - good! But is this why I cannot believe these books? They make death sound like breakfast television! Please - I do not mean to be unkind, but who is convinced by this?"
4,Beautiful Look of THe Other Side,I really like this Book...though it brings up alot more quiestions than it answeres in my opinion but I really like that she has done alot of research on these topics.
4,Attention grabber--you won't put it down,"Sylvia Browne paints a very vivid picture of how everything looks on the other side, buildings, statues, hobbies and more. She also tells how things work when you cross over. What processes you go through before and after coming to this world. I guess we won't know for sure if she's right until we all cross over. But it is a very good book that I couldn't put down. It made me want to get hypnotized to see what my subconscious knows."
4,Wow!,"Having just lost my brother very unexpectedly, at the age of 49, I've desperately been trying to find answers as to why this happened. I found Sylvia's book and read it cover-to-cover in no time flat. It has actually given me some comfort. Even though I still don't know WHY this happened, I do believe he is still here with us and is watching over us each and every day. I found Sylvia's descriptions of everything on the Other Side to be VERY interesting... the landscape, the buildings even the temperature! I'm still a bit skepitcal, but believe that eventually I can be completely convinced. I used to be afraid to die; I'm not any more. Death is actually something, I think, I'm looking forward to!"
5,A Must Read For Anyone Who Has Lost a Loved One!,"Be ready to sit down and read this book cover to cover. It is extremely hard to put down. Sylvia's words are very comforting as she gives us a glimpse into our true ""home"". She has successfully answered just about every question of what happens after we leave this world. I plan on giving this book to anyone who has or will lose a loved one in the future. What a comfort! Thanks Sylvia!"
4,This book is a major step toward defining the heavens.,"This book is a major revolution in defining the afterlife, souls, soulmates, and other practical aspects of spirituality. The book defines the afterlife in way that is satisfying, mature, intelligent, and inclusive. This book will get you through some the worst turmoil in you life. This book is very descriptive of classifications and entities in the spiritual realm. I found this book particularly useful for research. However, this books lacks an effective way to handle resurrection."
3,Psychic Beyond Normal Comprehension,"I like and respect well-know psychic Sylvia Browne.I also have some of her tapes and have seen her on several of the talk shows.I found this book a little far out and I think beyond the comprehension of the normal reader.As a child she says she saw ""dead people"" and parts of this book just come across downright ""spooky"".She speaks from her near death experience and about going thru the tunnel to the ""other side"".Even though I find this book very hard to try to comprehend, I do think she is a very special and psychically oriented person and she sees thing in a way that we normal people will never begin to understand."
4,Extremely interesting but...,"is it real? I believe that anyone that buys this book and reads it will consider it an extrememly interesting read. Ms. Browne has lead a wonderful and spirtually fulfilled life! As I was reading the book, I decided to look up her website, just out of courosity. For a spitual reading over the phone she charges $700.00! I am so happy that she has such a wonderful gift and I truly believe in her psychic abilities, I just don't approve of her financial profits from it... I believe if she is going to charge for reading, she should not charge such ridiculously high rates, afterall, it is the Lord's work she is doing... right?"
5,Very interesting and informative,"This was a great book. Very interesting and informative. I love to read anything having to do with psychics, intuition, the afterlife, supernatural, or how to use my own intuition. Thanks for a wonderful read!"
5,So comforting!!,"If even half of what Sylvia Browne relates in this book about the other side is true, we are in for a real treat one day! I found the book fascinating and so much of it rang true for me, which is saying a lot since I've been researching spiritual issues for 25 years. Definitely recommend for late night reading!"
5,good tape !!!!,"I listen to this tape while im driving, its how I relax and absorbe what sylvia is saying. what a great soul. she gave me a reason to live on.."
1,good book but all lies,"i purchased this book several years ago and enjoyed it immensely. and after seeing her on montel williams and hearing her on coast so coast am with art bell, i was completely hooked. what a truly amazing gift she has, right? i even went as far as booking a reading with her. the reading came and went. . . and absolutely nothing she said came true. while the book was a fun read, i learned a rather expensive lesson and will never again waste my money on anything that has to do with sylvia browne."
2,Did anyone notice the discrepancies?,"Don't get me wrong. I don't want to bash anything or anyone who advocates spirituality. But my rational mind just can't get beyond some factual errors this author makes. She makes a statement early in the book about ""the Salem witches who were burned at the stake."" They WEREN'T burned at the stake, they were hung. Since she makes such a case for her Spititual Guide knowing the causes of death of various people, this error really was quite jarring to me. Also, at the beginning of the book she says Francine died in 1520. Later on she says Francine's life came to end in 1598. Which is it? And why would she make such an error if she has been communicating with this spirit for over fifty years? (Also, where is her editor!) That said, I did find Sylvia's message peaceful and hopeful, and that can't be all bad, can it?"
5,AWESOME ***** Highly Recommended *****,"Of the multitude of books on heaven & the afterlife I've read, in my personal opinion, this one is the absolute BEST. If you need comforting, this is the book to read. I've also read other Sylvia Brown's books & she's not only also comforting, but also very interesting! ***Highly Recommended***"
4,Answer,"In answer to S. Fitzmeyer's question from Jan 1 2006On pg. 150 (hardback version, in subsection ""Spirit Guides"" in Chapter 7), Sylvia writes, ""Francine's one life on earth began in 1500 in a small village in northern Columbia ... At the age of 18 she married she married a silversmith and, less than a year later, gave birth to a baby girl ... One early morning a messenger arrived from a nearby village to frantically announce an approaching army of Spaniards who were ultimately to bring about Francine's demise - she was killed by a conquistador's spear in the Spanish invasion less than a week later, using her body as a shield to save her child's life.""This account is consonant with Brown's claim that Francine died in 1520. Her child would have been one year old.""1598"" on pg. 88 is obviously a typo."
5,She's done it again,"I have read all of Sylvia's books that she has written, and this one is the best one of all. I absolutely could not put this one down. I felt a calmness come over me that reassured me that I was indeed reading the truth. She has a very personal quality that everyone can relate to. She lays it all out in a way that makes me feel like I just had my spiritual battery turbo-charged. This book is a must read and I hope you will open your heart to the truth so you can spread your shining light for everyone to see. God Bless."
1,Life On The Other Side,I thought this book was terrible. It seemed like I was reading a book from outer space. I did not even finish it. I got about 3/4 of the way through the book and I had enough. I gave the book to the library.
1,Hog Wash,This woman is so full of herself. This is not even put together well. Boring.And how does she know it is so. I wish I'd never spent my hard earned cash on it.
4,Entertaining...Yes! Believable...???,"Reading a Sylvia Browne book is like sitting in the same room with her, listening to her tell you the story. Her self-deprecating humor comes through loud and clear, and is entertaining in itself. But to take what she says as ""gospel?"" I don't think so... Certainly documentation for what ""The Other Side"" looks like, etc., is limited to those who have experienced it through near death experiences or psychics like Sylvia. But these folks are human, which means they are fallible, which means they are offering us their own perspective on the subject, which can be colored by their interpretation. Did I enjoy Sylvia's book? Yes. Do I believe she is sincere? Yes. Do I believe in life after death? Yes. Do I think ""The Other Side"" is as Sylvia depicts it? Hard to say, but I'll find a way to let you know after my fifth (and final) exit point..."
2,Good Try,"Sylvia Browne at first sounds convincing in telling what happens after death. She explores the ""eternal life"" of the soul in a more than casual tone. Her ""spirit guide""named Francine was one thing, but the buildings and record halls and the rest of what the place looks like, belong more in fiction than what is being marketed here to people like myself after the loss of a loved one. The illustrations are pure fantasy and seem to come staight out of Roman Empire meets new age with a little bit of Escher. Right about chapter five, when the afterlife included precise descriptions of a cushy lifetsyle where it is exactly 78F, no inclement weather ever, etc., the author lost me."
3,Interesting read.,I purchased these for my wife who recently lost her father. She read them slowly over time. She found herself overwhelmed with emotion quite a few times so it was a tough read for her. She wasn't expecting any kind of closure out of her reading these but she said she did feel a little better. A little better is a huge leap for how crushed she was/is. I myself have read them as well with differing thoughts.
5,Sylvia tells it the way it is,"Some things are secret for a reason. That's obviously the way it's meant to be in the divine plan. Maybe we, as a human race, are not yet ready for the information in this book. It's all a question of humanity's growth. Just as a five-year old isn't ready to hear about quantum mechanics and the structure of the universe, so we (or at least the masses) are not quite ready to hear about details of life on the Other Side and our soul's journey beyond the veil of death. For most people, Browne's insights will appear absurd, or even ""wrong"". For the enlightened few, it will be music to the ears."
5,I love Sylvia Browne!!!,"I knew there was a heaven but I didn't understand the whole concept. When I first started reading Sylvia's books, that is when everything fell into place. As I read each chapter it was like a light went off in my brain. I felt connected and finally understood why certain things happened in my life. Also, asking to be draped in a white light from the holy spirit, not just for me, but people I consider a negative drain on my well being, actually worked. All you skeptics, need to take the time to understand her books before you become so critical. If you do this, you will end up being relieved to know, there definitely is Life On The Other Side. If I had the money I would love to see Sylvia Browne in person, however, if it is not in my destiny, I will definitely catch up with her on the other side and let her know how she made this life of mine easier to deal with."
5,Excellent reading,"This is a must read if you are familiar with Sylia at all. This book will open your eyes, your mind and your heart. Sylvia explains why we are who we are, and why we do the things we do. Don't pass up this book."
4,Salem Witch Trial Error in the Text,"I very much enjoy Life on the Other Side. However,I DO have one question I would love to pose Ms. Browne: If the reader is to take as Gospel (no pun intended) your facts about The Other Side, then why did you get the fact about the Salem Witch Trials wrong? On pg. 84 you state that, among others,""several of the women who were burned at the stake during the Salem witch trials"" find their way to the Towers on the other side. If you research the Salem trials I think you will find that those accused of witchcraft were not burned at the stake but were, in fact, hanged.While I VERY much wish to believe your good news about The Other Side, the skeptic in me asks: ""If Ms. Browne cannot get her facts straight about THIS world, how reliable are her facts about the world to follow?"""
2,To hard to believe,"I recently lost my father and turned to Life on the Other Side to help me feel better about where my dad is now. The book made me feel worst. Sylvia goes into to much detail about reincarnation. Some people might feel otherwise but I want to know my dad is with my/his family on the other side, not with a bunch of people I don't know from his previous lives. I also thought the detail of Heaven and spirit's jobs on teh other side was a little to hard to believe. How could Sylvia be the one person alive that knows exactly in great detail what heaven is like? I used to be a fan of Sylvia but I think she is a fake. I believe she has soem abilty to connect with spirits but not as much as she claims. I would recommend John Edward and James Van Praagh books."
1,A Book Of Make Believe!,"I like and enjoy reading books of the spiritual nature. But this really was a joke. Started off ok but soon degenerated into the realms of fantasy.Unfortunately, i didn't know who Sylvia Browne was at the time. But have since seen her on the Montel Williams show. I don't know whether she does have any psychic powers or not, but its clear shes making a lot of it up and just tells people what they want to here.Just threw this book away in the end, not worthy of the space it takes up!"
2,Question???,"On page 10, It says that Francine was killed by a spear in 1520 while trying to protect her child.(Note: Francine came to Earth only once) Then, on page 88, the book says, ""It was 1956 when Francine physically appeared to my family, and her one incarnation here ended in 1598. Didn't she die in 1520?"
1,A Few Questions,"In his outstanding book ""The Demon-Haunted World,"" Carl Sagan says this:How is it, I ask myself, that channelers never give us verifiable information otherwise unavailable? Why does Alexander the Great never tell us about the exact location of his tomb, Fermat about his Last Theorem, John Wilkes Booth about the Lincoln assassination conspiracy, Herman Goring about the Reichstag fire? Why don't Sophocles, Democritus, and Aristarchus dictate their lost books? Don't they wish future generations to have access to their masterpieces?"
3,Do I Believe?,"I read Sylvia's previous book, and doplan on reading current one. I feelsure Iwill still have my currentopinion, and that is "" with tonguein cheek"". I would like to believe hertotally, but common sense, and havinglived 80 years tells me this: she ispsychic but carries that a little toofar. At one point she stated a womanwalked through the doorway and Sylivaknew instantly that woman had a seriousbladder infection and had to get to aDr immediately. Let me tell you something about that: I've had thatproblem off and on for many years, andit is so painful NO ONE would be outwalking anywhere except getting to adoctor's office. S.B. is entertainingand her book does give us something tothink about. So, will I read hercurrent book? Probably will."
4,Great account of this famous battle,When the movie on Gettysburg was first released in Australia I tried desperately to find a book to read about the battle. I found this one and I enjoyed it a great deal. It may not be the most detailed account available but I found it to be one of the best that gave a complete overview of the 3 days fighting without getting lost or bored. The authors style of writing was refreshing and enjoyable and I found it hard to put the book down. Still one of my favourite books on this battle although I have read many since.
3,A pretty good introduction to the Battle of Gettysburg,"Glenn Tucker takes the time to cover just about all aspects of the Battle of Gettysburg in this book. However by doing so the writer seems to be bored at times, feeling he has to convey what happened though it has no consequences or historical value only that it, in fact, happened (Stuart and the calvaries on the third day). At the same time, the profiles of the individuals involved in this great battle (their personal histories and even physical appearances) are supurb and add a touch of familiarity. Also, there are moments when the author's prose is truly eloquent, haunting, vivid, and beautiful at the same time."
3,copyright 1958,4 stars as I am just supplying info on date of publication and that seems to be the consensus.
4,Very good,"I found fear to be one of the best games around now.It is a intense shooter and very challenging.But after playing games like FarCry,Boiling Point and GTA Vice City it seems to be a small step backwards in the gamming community."
4,was nice,"was ok, but as a seasoned gamer I expected more. decent graphics, gameplay, it has the feel of a blockbuster movie somehow. the weapons and enemies got old, nothing unique about them. I don't get what all the rage is about. I found doom 3 way scarier than this, and clive barker's jericho is one of my favs due to its environment."
3,"Fun game, BUT......","it just couldn't hold my attention. I guess I still hold all 1st person shooters to the Half Life 2 standard.The graphics are good, but not great. Certain things look good from a distance, but not up close-even with the anti-aliasing turned all they way up. The sound is o.k. The gameplay is somewhere in between good, and o.k. There just wasn't enough about the game to make me keep playing. Luckily I bought the game used.The only gripe I have is that I cannot access the special features on the DVD. Vivendi customer service was no help, so I just gave up. It is nice having the game on one disk, but I would like to get EVERYTHING I paid for.All in all the game was o.k., but not ground-breaking like it has been described as."
2,Copyright protection killed my gaming experience,"My brother gave me rave reviews of this game. I will admit, it was fun when the game actually works. The problem is, the manufacturers of F.E.A.R. installed anti-emulator software with the game. I made it about halfway through and the next time I went to fire up F.E.A.R., there was an error that said the game cannot play. I did a little research and found the anti-pirate software will no longer run my legitimate copy of this game that I bought used from Amazon. What a load of _____. So I uninstalled the game, reinstalled it, and downloaded another copy of the 1.08 patch. The same error popped up when I restarted my PC. All this hassle and the game will no longer run. Once again, I uninstalled/reinstalled, hoping that the retail version 1.0 will work. No such luck. The game crashed as it loaded my saved game. What gives? Way to punish the gamer."
5,Best AI ever!!,"i've played countless first person shooters now, and i have to say, F.E.A.R. is one of the best games i've played, if your looking for a challenge in shooting enemies then this would be it as it has the most impressive AI's a game can give, this is a MUST for 1st person shooters, don't miss it out!"
5,Amazing shooter,"I'd take it down a notch because the story could have been told so much better than by finding and listening to ""voice mail"" on telephones... but the creepy atmoshpere and excellent level design make this a must-play"
5,noise from a band that DOESNT CARE ABOUT YOU,"this album is absolutely incredible. what makes it so great is why so many can't stand it: its SO extreme. even though its not always all screaming, it's like 300 bpm with either screaming or high pitched yelling, with a moog keyboard that adds a new dimension to its double bass roll grind. they are just around to totally f*** with everybody, indiscriminately. theyre making real, visceral and incredible art. nobody can deny that. they dont care who likes it. and to eversotragic: they aren't talented???? what???? have you heard the drums on this album???? the drums are on jazz-inflected blast-beat mode the whole time!!! the keyboardist plays like he has 8 fingers on each hand!!! i dare any haters to try to play the guitar riffs and bass line. what? no volunteers?"
2,Worst music I ever heard but not the worst band,"my first experience with band was walking into the bathroom and seeing 4 short guys in masks at the urinals. After I got out I saw that these guys where the band playing. I saw them setting up and was kind of excited as I saw all the different effects pedels the guitar player. Then they ""played"" for 30 seconds, then played for 20 then 30. The best way I can explain it as loud sounds. At one point it sounded like a black board scraping. Possible the worse music I have ever heard. As I prayed for it to be over I was watching the guitar player and the drummer. They are the reason that I gave this cd two stars. I go to a lot of shows and don't think I have ever seen someone play faster then both of these guys. I also wanted to know if this band has lyrics or do they just make sounds"
2,YAWN,"I appreciate noise, but sometimes I just want songs, maybe with a little melody perhaps? This stuff is just boring. It's supposed to be ""SO EXTREME"", but it's more like ""WHO CARES?"" I didnt even realize these guys were still around, until someone ""COOL"" played me this CD. Best thing about these guys...the song titles."
1,Wow...,"It sure is cool to know that you can make the worst music possible and still sell records. I don't care who you are, you cannot possibly like the Locust. For anyone who has not heard this band, do yourself a favor and don't bother. It isn't music. It's not even close."
3,Can crap be art?,"Listeners to this album will fall into two different categories:1) those whose musical tastes are so perverted and warped that they enjoy this trashy noise2) everyone else (who will hate it and think you're an idiot just for putting it on the stereo)The music on this CD sounds like hardcore/punk music mixed in a 50/50 ratio with human fecal matter and ground-up cockroaches. If this sounds like something you would be curious about putting in your ears, give it a listen.However, if you don't like Melt Banana, Mr. Bungle, or some other extremely bizarre bands, don't even consider picking this one up.(I own this CD and I put it on every 6 months perhaps)"
1,Another disappointment,I was told that this was the savior of the underground. Well I really should have just listened to Orchid instead.
4,Plaugue Landscapes - Crazy,"The Locust hits you with this album, quickly, loudly, and intensely. Their short, high energy and power songs are great, but take some getting used to. Most of the songs are under a minute long, but are filled with insane drumming, screaming, and fast passed guiatrs. It is a great cd to go crazy to."
4,for neural re-arrangement,"from the depths of some subconscious mind and into the aural recesses and extragalactic brain cells of beings everywhere, this is some pretty heady and heavy stuff. Seemingly non-sensical and brilliant all in the same unique brush."
5,oh my jebus. the last three reviews were lame.,"these last three people don't know what they are even talking about. the locust have been around longer than dillinger escape plan and have been doing this type of grindcore/hardcore, what i like to call spazzcore, since 95. so comparing them to dillinger is a ""slap in the face"". but to do non-structure songs and play them for shows takes way more talent than anyone can understand. the songs are so fast, and should make you feel privileged that such a band exists. if you say you are a true fan of music in general, then you should love what these guys are doing to try to change the way music is viewed.the locust are indeed the greatest ""true"" band out there."
4,you have to be in the mood for it. and a little insane.,"i like the locust. but not all the time. sometimes the loud, herky jerky, abrasive, 1000 miles a minute blasts of electronic noise made by justin pearson and co. are just what the doctor ordered. usually if i have an excess of energy i need to release. other days it really rubs me the wrong way. a sidenote: my girlfriend and my brother both hate this music as do alot of other people, so listen to the sound clips before you buy it. but if you know what youre getting into then this is the locust album that you should buy. the other ones are too short to justify how much they cost. except maybe safety second body last. its short but still has some snazzy electronics. proceed at your own risk."
2,I didn't like it.,It is pretty but not for me. It didn't do anything for me when I put it on. I returned it.
4,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Whom,Where, When, What, and Why?","I can't answer all the questions surrounding this album,but here's some of the scuddle. It starts with a group of far southern songsmiths getting their YULE on and laying a couple fresh tracks . Not wishing to seem sour or get stale, the group loses a couple of holiday harpers, yet continues to craft two additional YULEridGEMals each year for the next three years. In 96 the trio becomes a duet and dose two more tunes. The next year they produce the complete collection and offer it up in tune with the world. ... Post Script:This type of disc is why YULEtide Treasure Seekers further thier quest, a load of only seasonal surprisals and generous genre inclusions.Five star effort throughout, but only ten tracks and no instru-tinsel dose the dim to four. ..."
5,Hurrah for Maureen!,"It really is well-done--wonder where it's disappeared to these days. Saw it in school over 20 years ago, and have never forgotten it. Very good music, great acting. This version is both touching, heartwarming, etc., AND it captures the sorta-dark-and-creepy vibe of Bradbury's original tale. Much better than the chopped-up, ham-handed Twilight Zone episode based on the same story."
5,Best Movie Ever!,"I've looked for this movie for years. When my daughter was little we saw it on TV. I'd recommend this movie to everyone, it's not just about the lost of someone."
2,not for everyone,"So many people wrote wonderful reveiws of this item, so I bought it and was very dissapointed. I've been doing yoga for several months, and although I still consider myself a beginner, I did not find that this workout challenged me at all physically. I feel much more mentally focused when I do Linda Arkin's Flexibility and Strength tapes, and I also feel that I get a workout.Batsheva talks a lot. Be prepared to hear lots of ""goods"" and other encouraging remarks. I would have preferred some relaxing music to her constant talking. This may sound silly, but her long, red painted nails were very distracting to me."
5,excellent moves and commentary,"I enjoy her description of chakras particularly, and her style just carries you along and really helps you to understand the nature of yoga. For me, the breathing is wonderful and most helpful."
2,pretty slow going,"I ordered this after reading all the rave reviews below. And I guess I would have liked it well enough if I were a true beginner to yoga, and just looking for a stretch-out-and-relax experience, rather than a workout to go with my mind-stop. But this was just pitched too low & slow for my taste. This may be because I've learned everything I know from much tougher tapes (e.g. Bryan Kest & Baron Baptiste) & have gotten used to that pace. Also, the production level here is SO nonexistent, which might attract some people but just makes me a little less motivated."
1,"No lamp, no happiness","Several weeks (!)after ordering this item, we were informed that it was being shipped. We were going on vacation, so I made special arrangements with neighbors to receive it. Then, when we were away, we were informed that it was no longer available. Bah. What I had ordered was a good-looking 300w halogen lamp. There no longer seems to be anything like this in the catalog of Visiondecor - or anywhere else, for that matter. Strange, indeed. We simply want a good-looking lamp throwing a lot of light on the ceiling. Can't find one. If anyone has any advice where to find such an item, we'd appreciate it."
1,Forget about it and get a cheapy powder from the drug store,"It was clumpy and the color was off and I really was not impressed at all with this product. Went back to the powders, it looks more natural. This makes you look like you put mascara on your eyebrows!!!"
4,Took a while to get into it but glad I stuck with it,"I had a really time getting interested in this book. I wasn't a big fan of the character, Harriet (Jen's mom), and wasn't looking forward to reading too much more about her and her interactions with Jen. Luckily Harriet was not in all that many scenes in the book.Once I got going with the book I enjoyed it. I found most all the characters likeable. I didn't necessarily feel like I got to Jen all that much but there was enough to work with and relate to.The book picked up and I sat down and read straight through the last 80 pages. I would recommend it."
3,A witty quick read,"This ""chick lit"" book is better then most - an intelligent heroine does more then just worry about her love life. There is a bit of mystery to it as well. It is not often you read books about MBA students - as an MBA grad myself, it was great!"
1,Painful...,"I can't write, that's why I am not a writer. Here is a game for you: count the number of times the main characters ""sigh"" or ""frown"" on each page... The writing is painful: she frowns, he frowned, he sighs, she sighed... I am frowning and sighing trying to get through this book."
3,Reasonable way to pass the time on the plane...,"It was a quick, lightly entertaining...I'll read something by the same author in the future, I'm sure (although I'd probably get it from the library!)"
2,Found it hard to get through,"To me, this book was straight chick lit, and poor chick lit at that. The writing was so full of cliches and stilted language and the ""intrigue"" was not interesting. In fact I am having trouble finishing it even though it's a fast read."
5,This little book is truly a gift of gladness!,"My true love gave me this little book in 1969, and after all these years, I still treasure it with all my heart. Many pearls of wisdom, encouragement, joy, and happiness are within these pages...the perfect gift to give someone you really love or care about."
1,"BEWARE! The ""authors"" DID NOT actually write this one!","The credited authorship of this publication can belong to any physician who pays a price! After making some inquiries of other laser centers, I learned that MedWorld Publishing makes the following offer via fax to many physicians performing LASIK:""Become the author of your own book in just one month! Personalize the book with your own title and cover, with you listed as author and your bio on the back cover for a nominal fee.""The information in this book may be factual, but it's source seems to me to be dubious at best. It disturbs me that any physician would stoop to this seemingly dishonest level of self-promotion. It strikes me as being equal to buying a pre-written term paper. I regret I'm even forced on this site to give this sham publication even one star."
3,Not enough traditional quilting for my tastes....,"A century of quilts is about a team of quilters who gathered together to select and assemble the 100 best quilts of the 20th century. The artists are discussed briefly, and their quilts and techniques are showcased.I admit, I prefer more traditional piecing. Most of the quilts shown in the exhibits were way too modern for my tastes. I would really have liked to have seen more quilts from the depression era, more quilts with blocks, and traditional piecing methods. Also the vast majority of quilts are appliqued. I just am not into applique that much. The quilts, showcased towards the ends in which people paint on quilts, and in which quilts are designed to look like photos just don't resonate with me.This video didn't enthuse me. It is short (1 hour), and seemed to feature way too many modern artists. I would've liked to see more traditional quilts which were functional as well as beautiful."
3,ride the wave,This is probably the easiest listening alblum of the trio of CD's. None of the songs stand out at all and it did not seem as exciting to me as the first 2 CD's of the set. It is all authentic surf music with lots of saxaphone. Althogh a bit borring I can't complain on the production and recording quality of this third CD. If you purchased the first 2 CD's of the set you may as well buy this one and complete this outstanding collection of 60's surf tunes.
5,Wow! GREAT! Best Surf Compilation since Cowabunga Set!,"I do not know all the inside info on all those obscure bands that hit the surf in California in the (esp. early) 60s. But I do know a lot about other music, Classical, Jazz, 70s & 80s disco, or in other words, the sound of good stuff! This is! The Cowabunga 4 CD set to me seemed unbeatable. Until this issue by Sundazed records came out. What an absolute GREAT sound the surf music is! Guitars, slow or rough, the melody, it truly captures the unspeakable beauty and excitement of surfing in the Pacific!Loaded with info, the booklet is a wealth of information about all those bands you do not know the names of. Now you do, and you can check them out on individual albums if you want. Go for this set, all 4 of them! And check out the Rare Surf volumes 1-2-3 too!My favorite on this cd3 is Spanish Moon by Travellers, one of the best instrumentals so far, ever!Conclusion: 60s surf to me is the coolest, greatest sound around!"
1,Recycle this book,"Before I chose this book as the text for my class I had heard that the previous year's students hated it. I read through it and decided to give it a chance. About half way through the semester I had to give up and start using other texts. My students could not stand it and neither could I. The arrangement of topics within a chapter makes no sense to me. Topics of primary importance are relegated to the chapter end in a ""A Deeper Look"" section. My students told me that they could not figure out how to do the problems by reading the text.How useful is that?! I found the problems to be fairly easy once you managed to figure out what the Hell was being asked which was not at all obvious. I think that with some serious rearrangement it could be good since the Rubinsons are not bad writers and clearly put a great deal of effort into this hundred dollar door jamb."
1,Buy another book,"I hate this book! The lack of examples and clear explanation is immensely frustrating. Compared to Daniel Harris' analytical chemistry textbook, this book is even worse. I highly advocate finding another book with more examples and thorough explanation."
2,disappointed,"I ordered this as a gift and returned it due to some of the crude messages,foul language and pictures. It's an interesting book to look through but not what I had in mind for a book supporting peace."
3,Skip the Introduction,"Skip the introduction. Anyone with any training in history, anthropology or archaeology will be irritated by the outdated concepts of religion and civilization presented by Burtt in the introduction. Granted, the book was written in the 1950s, but I was still irritated. So then, why read this book? The book provides a great compilation of writings on and by the Buddha. Some of Burrt's commentary provides an insightful context into the culture and practice. For example, Burrt describes where Theravada Buddhism is practiced and the differences between the original teachings, Mahayana, and Theravada Buddhism as an introduction for the Buddhist texts. I enjoyed being able to read the original writings and the fundamental teachings from which Buddhism grew."
5,Good Intro To The Ideas of a Great Thinker---Mr. Buddha,"This is one of the ""original"" ""self-help books"" written by a great thinker. You will benefit by reading this book. Recommended. boland7214@aol."
5,Fasinating Movie,"If you are into drama, thrillers, or suspense, this movie is a must see. The producers couldn't ask for a better actor than Neil Patrick Harris, he truly displayed an excellent performance. This movie, which is based on a true story, is so disturbing that it will make you cringe. It is so heart felt that it will make you cry. Sudden Fury opened the door for people too see that every family that seems loving and every parent you wish to model are not necessarily what it seem to be. Sudden Fury exposes the truth that mental, emotional and verbal abuse takes place in all types of environments and if not attentive many of us may never know of its existence."
5,Great movie!,I'm a big fan of Neil Patrick Harris. This movie was full of suspense and the acting was excellent. I recommended it to family and friends.
3,Shallow character development of parents,"Though Neil Patrick Harris is great, I have seen him in far more interesting roles than this. There is too much missing background about the parents. There is only a hint of what life was like growing up in this abusive household. Also there is no indication until the end credits that this is based on a true story."
5,Can't get it out of my head,"This is obviously the start of a brilliant career for our boys from 'across the pond'. Crisp and thoughtful, daring and deliberate. Rita is my holiday pick for favorite new song of 1999. Against my usual better judgment, these guys should quit their day jobs and jump in with both feet. Not since Bob Dylan has a maiden release captured the essence of starving poets everywhere like this one has, the sky's the limit. I can't say enough about their possibilities, but steal a sample from their Web site, see for yourself and then buy the CD."
5,Presents the essentials,"Like most people in the business world today, my position entails multiple jobs and responsibilities. One of those is an in-house training program. Because I have little teaching experience, this was a great book to help me get started by presenting the basics of everything from classroom set-up to learning and teaching personalities. Great book for the novice, and gives great ideas for the old-hatters."
5,"Very Helpful, Practical Information","I found the information in this book helpful from the very first page. The tips Mr. Clothier shares in his book are very practical and specific, from writing course material to dealing with ""difficult"" students. Although the print date is almost ten years old, I found the information to be quite relevant even today. I am not certain, however, whether it is worth the $110 price currently listed. I paid $40 used, and I don't regret a penny that I spent. I keep it at my desk and refer to it often as a refresher."
4,The game is very unique and will make you thinkin' on a ticker,"look the game is tricky , and has its faults , it may not seen as professional compared to todays standards, but its very fun and is a great 2 player .you play the game by placing blocks down that fit exactly where the block supposed to fit until you open up enough space to place your last block down the core. If you goof up three times in a row by placing the block were the block doesn't fit correctly then you lose and you get a game over.If you aren't patient , can't take a challenge ,try a new experience, or you aren't even a puzzle game fan then you will yell at the tv a lot .look I don't understand all the hate this game gets on amazon, its a cool original game that only on the Nintendo 64.this is different but its tetris in 3d sphere , its a great concept just give time to get used to it..."
1,I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO MAKE THIS A ONE STAR,THIS GAME SUCK'S!YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND IT DON'T HAVE GOOD GRAPHICS. I AM SO MAD I BOUGHT THIS GAME. I WON'T WAIST MY MONEY ON ANY MORE GAMES UNLESS THEY GET A 4 OR ABOVE RATING! AND I WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I ALWAYS PLAY TETRIS SINCE I WAS LITTLE! AND IT NEVER GETS BORING. BUT THIS ONE DOES AFTER TRYING TO PLAY IT THREE TIMES I WAS UPSET AND DONE.
3,as expected,"Arrived in a timely manner, installed fairly easily, couldn't get one wrinkle on the hood piece out. The center of the hood piece rises and falls, looks like it's breathing when driven over 55 or so. Looks good! Worth the money."
3,Okay,"Chokher Bali is originally a Bengali film, but it is easy to understand in Hindi. The acting is wonderful although the story does take a while to grow on the audience. A tad confusing at times but very entertaining. A must see for all Rabindranath Tagore and Aishwarya Rai fans!"
4,Very impressed,"I'm not the greatest fan of Bollywood films but I was very impressed with this film. No song and dance to see here but just a wonderful, subtle and sensuous performance by Aishwary Rai. If you're a fan of hers I recommend this film. She was very impressive and so was the film. Dark but engaging."
4,Great romance between secondary characters,"The story is nice, but I thought the romance between the secondary characters, Alan and Opal, overshadowed it. The fact that this secondary romance was so good is why I give this book 4 stars!"
2,Different color shade of leather,"Was disappointed with the color of the shoe, because there is a difference between the left and right shoe.At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box.But no, it's the shade of the leather that is different, left shoe is darker than the right shoe.Being in Singapore, it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement. (I had the shoe delivered to my Brother-in-law in L.A., who brought it back to Singapore for me)"
3,Okay,"The shoes are pretty nice, except for a flaw on the left shoe. There is one stripe that has some sort of glue (super glue I think)and is a different material/finish than the rest of the stripes."
3,"little on the cheap side, but works","Typical Chinese quality, but it works great. The switch stem kinda pokes out a little but not really a problem"
4,good examples,Lots of good examples of different form of fiddle tunes. Most with D and G harmonica. Lots of fun. I am a beginner level and can do half of the book with no problem.
3,Splash guard problem,We found that the splash guard made it difficult for our daughter to sit on the potty without our help. She is only 18 months but wants to sit by herself. We have loved all other baby bjorn products but we are returning this one.
2,Too many messes with this potty! : (,"I thought this potty would be great for my son since it has a high, non-removable splash guard, but that is the only good thing about this potty chair. It must be uncomfortable because it always leaves a red ring around his bottom, even if he just sits on it for a couple of minutes. It also sticks to his bottom and when he stands up to get off the potty, the bowl comes out too and spills the contents all over the floor! : ( I have had to clean up several messes just because the bowl comes out so easily when he stands up. Baby Bjorn would improve this product by padding the seat a bit and having the bowl latched into place so it wouldn't come out so easily and spill its contents."
2,Not for girls,"I wouldn't recommend this potty for anyone. It is very light and has nothing to keep it from sliding around on a hard floor. When my daughter sits on it, it usually moves around, sometimes causing her to lose her balance. Also, b/c the splashguard isn't removable, she sat on it a few times, which really hurt her. I finally turned it around, but since it's not made to fit that way, I really had to jam it in there, which makes for not-so-easy removal to empty it."
1,I really wanted to love this!,"I am insane when it comes to researching products for my toddler and knew all the pros and cons of this potty chair. However, I love the Baby Bjorn line and have never been disappointed before, so I bought this one even after ready several negative reviews. I really wanted a simple chair for my 2 year old daughter. Well, she loved the idea of it too, but was frustrated by the shield on the bucket (as apparently most girls are). She kept trying to turn the bucket around so the shield would be out of the way, but it doesn't fit that way. The chair does slide around as well, but we fixed that by positioning it in the corner. After 2 days of trying, she just couldn't overlook how uncomfortable the chair was. She's an average sized two year old, but it still was a tight fit. We returned the chair and, after much deliberation and testing, purchased the Graco soft seat potty chair. I do not like the Graco brand usually, but so far that chair is doing the trick."
5,Best potty chair ever,"This is the second potty chair we have purchased. Although this is simple looking and a simple design, it works perfect. My two year old boy, has no problem with leaks, no spray issues with the splash guard, he fits on it perfect, it is really easy to clean and dump. What more could you ask for. I do recommend to not get the musical throne by fisher price. It leaks terribly. I am so excited, I thought I would have had to go through many seats before finding the right one."
5,"Great, easy to use potty","I bought this potty awhile back after reading lots of reviews and love it. Initially I liked the simplistic design and the fact that there are no gimmicks, just a potty. Now that my 22 month old son is potty training I am so thankful I bought this one. It is so easy to clean and he seems to find it comfortable to sit on. This is my fourth child and I wish I had had this one with my other kids because there is almost no way that liquid is going to end up anywhere other than in the potty! Other potties leaked because we would remove the splash guard since they tended to pinch. This splash guard is built in and doesn't seem to bother him one bit. I don't see any problem with a little girl using it, either. In fact, my niece used it the other day and had no trouble. The only drawback I can see is if you have a very large child, but otherwise, I love this potty and would recommend it to anyone with a toddler."
2,Easy to clean but not easy for my son to use,"I bought this because I thought it was nice and simple-easy to clean and no leaks. However, my son won't use it. He won't sit on it because it is uncomfortable-not enough seat and hard splash guard. So then he tries to pee like daddy and it slides away. I am going to return it. The problem is, I can't find a good one for a boy which is comfortable, easy to clean, doesn't leak and is like a ""real"" adult potty for imitating."
2,Too Difficult to Sit On!,"I read the reviews and bought this potty chair, figuring that based on other users' opinions my daughter would love it. However, the high splash guard on the front makes it very difficult for her to sit down. You cannot just back up and sit, you need to be directly over the potty to sit down. She has turned the bowl around, placing the splash guard to the back, but then she cannot sit back and get comfortable on the seat. Perhaps it works for those with boys - I wouldn't know - but I cannot recommend it to parents of girls."
5,Great Potty!,"We bought this potty to accompany the training method described in ""Potty Training in Less Than a Day"" by Azrin and Foxx, as the book encourages training the child to dump his/her own potty (we have since ""untrained"" this--the bathroom is too far away!). I am now going to buy one for my son's preschool, because he is often sent home with a a sack of wet pants--wet in the back, due to no pee guard! This potty is, indeed, easy to empty and clean, and it is definitely perfect for a boy over 18 months old and maybe for taller toddler girls who can easily clear the high front (the little one-piece baby bjorn potty is great for smaller children). In addition, the backrest makes it very comfortable. If only there were a girl model with no pee guard to get in the way! However, the pee guard is what makes it easy to dump, and I am really happy it is not removable, because those kinds always fall off."
1,A big disappointment,"I was looking forward to receiving this product for my toddler, and couldn't wait to have her use it. However, we soon learned that the design is very poor. The potty chair slides all over the floor, leaving my poor daughter falling down and scared to use it. The cramped seat design also forces the bowl part to come out when she stands up. This is a very big disappointment for a Baby Bjorn product! I also bought their little step stool for when my daughter can step up to use the toilet, and that thing does not move at all on the floor! Baby Bjorn should have designed the potty chair like their step stool with the rubber on the bottom, and it would have been a much more useful product. I wish I could get my money back."
2,Hard to sit on,...Its design is pretty good but I my 20 months old son are not so happy with this.Its very difficult for him to sit on his own.Plastic is not soft to sit comfortably. I always have to keep some cusion onto sides of sit and hold the potty seat and put him in exactly in the center.
4,Spillproof comfortable Chair,"I bought Safety 1st chair today and just read the terrible reviews. Good I haven't open it. Tomorrow I'll return that and purchase Baby Bjorn, as it doesn't look like to be one which will leak. I like the back support which is needed for little ones and it's especially made for boys. Easy to clean the seat. Hate to clean after every use of Safety 1st."
2,What a Mess!,This is a terrible potty for a boy. The splash guard doesn't work. And the leat leaks. I end up with pee all over the floor every time. Yuk!
3,Didn't come in the color as shown!,"This just arrived. I haven't used it yet. This sounds silly, but I really wanted it as pictured. With the black 'basin' and white base. The entire thing is white. Wonder if other people experienced this also?? hmmmm"
1,Are you kidding me?,So much for trusting the Amazon star rating system (4 1/2 stars?)! Serves me right for basing my buying decision on only 3 reviews. This is an amateurish attempt at a mystery novel and the ending is pathetic! Don't waste your time and money!
4,"Superior recording, superior series",Want more than the Fours Seasons? This recording will expand your Vivaldi experience and it's only one of an excellent series.
5,16 Exitos de Oro,"This is one of the best singers of all times. This music lets you listen to the lyrics instead of all types of instruments. This is clean music with very good taste. I particularly been searching for this disc to give it to my girl as a birthday present. She was named after the tittle ""Veronica"" of this disc."
5,Great Movie!!! At least I think so.,"I love the whole atmosphere this movie has. In my opinion it's a great prequel to 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. I just wish that it came on blu-ray disk. Its not a movie for everyone. Especially since there are a few inconsistencies, but if you don't analyze it I think you'll enjoy it. Happy Viewing!!!"
4,Fun movie,"This is good, but not great movie. Worth watching once. I probably won't want to watch it again for a long time. It is the type of movie better gotten from Netflix or iTunes than purchasing the DVD, but it is cheap enough, so you might consider getting it for those times when you want some light entertainment. It is not at the same level as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but is still worth a viewing."
2,Remake flop,"I've always liked Robert Ryan, but not as Captain Nemo, and (blue-eyed Geronimo) Chuck Connors looks out of place. A very poor re-make of the Classic with James Mason as Captain Nemo.The special effects in the original were good for their time. These are fair and it appears some are from the original. There are a lot of great DVDs available; I would pass this one by."
4,Inside Look,"A sweet and bittersweet look at as a young girl goes to war. It is mainly a happy book, well written by a wonderful author.In the end it is about learning about life, love and how it all fits together."
3,"Ordered once, only two different colors","Thought the rainbow colors would be a great way to spice it up and add some variety. This ""rainbow"" consisted of half red and half green. The condoms themselves work great, which led to the 3 stars, but if you are ordering for the color variety, you may be a little disappointed."
1,Not a romance,"More like a soap opera, not a romance. The whole Texas series is very hard to get through."
3,Where in Texas?,"I have found the Texas series interesting for light reading, but like most people, I want a minimum of 'poetic license' about my home! After reading the last book 'Texas Sunrise' first, then the first two in the series, I feel certain Ms Michaels' research for these books did NOT include the briefest glance at a map. My mind kept giving me those ""say what?"" feelings as the terrain, topography, flora and weather of central Texas were ill-represented. If she wanted these stories set in North Dakota, she could well have said so. It was distracting to say the least, to read about a December snowfall that is unheard of in that area. The real topper was, however on page 500 of 'Texas Heat' when she places Austin in the Texas Panhandle...only about 600 miles off course....I wonder how the Japanese, Hawaiians, and New Yorkers accept the descriptions of their homes?"
5,Good For A New Baby in the house,This is the best toy yet. I got this toy for graduatoin because I had always wanted twins. I played with this toy formonths. and it's been 4 months and the baby smell is still on it. I would recommend this toy for anyone
5,Special Gift,"I saw the ad in the Toys ""R' Us Big Toy book for these precious baby twins. It completely got my attention and won my heart over as I have boy/girl infant twins myself, and I had never seen a boy/girl set of twin dolls before. In fact, most of the time, all baby dolls seem to be female which I think isn't fair, as even though I do have one daughter, I'm also the mother of two boys so why should little girls only have female dolls and not male to play with?Well, I decided to get these and save them for my daughter once she's old enough to play with them. I feel that it will be special to her as she will be able to identify with being a twin herself, and playing with twin dolls will be pretty natural to her. Heck, maybe it's training for her, she might very well have twins herself one day! :)I think these dolls are fantastic..."
5,Keeps me coming back!,"For a medium roast coffee, this coffee is the best I've had outside a coffee shop. I enjoy a lot of others, but if I had to pick a favorite K cup, this is it! Nantucket has a smooth, mellow but full-bodied taste. Brew on medium for best cup. I just wish Amazon had it on subscribe and save."
4,cost is rediculous,The item is extremely good and flavorful. Your cost is way out of line. You can go to Bed Bath & beyond and purchase a box of 18 for 9.99 and if you have their very easy to get coupons you can reduce that price by 20% and no shipping cost. Thats approx .44 per K-Cup. Why would anyone in their right mind want to pay from .65 per cup to over 1.00 plus shipping.
4,Speaking of tiresome...Lipsitz would seem to have a point,"One reviewer, below, seems utterly outraged at the notion that there could be a white ""culture"" of possessive investment, although he is entirely comfortable throwing around terms like ""culture of success"" and ""inherited culture"" when referring to non-white groups. Talk about skinning a cat another way. Lipsitz may occasionally overindulge his tendency to psychologize, but to dismiss his account of whiteness as an ""organizing principle in social and cultural relations,"" as L. puts it, would be in error. An excellent introduction to the topic. Lots of other good stuff out there, too: Roediger, Frankenberg, et al. Dive in."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"George Lipsitz may have a decent point here - that whiteness comes with advantages. But reading his book is much too tiresome to attempt to understand this point. Like far too many academics, his style is unreadable (ex: way too many buzzwords). His examples are weak, and he shows an obvious distaste for conservatives. Try reading Andrew Hacker's Two Nations instead."
1,More of the same...,"After being assigned a reading list about racial relations in the US, I began the process of reading each book. This book was at the top of that list.As usual, I was disappointed. So far, the two books I have read on race relations follow the same pattern. They create their own strawman to knock down by creating their own social, or racial constructs that they can proceed to debunk. Each author creates their own definition of ""whiteness"" - which isn't even the same, and then proceeds to select examples that tries to prove their own constructed definitions. Useless."
3,Good Information/Poor Presentation,"Only those who have a hightened interest in Byzantine history should select this text. The book presents an interesting view of Africa and Egypt under Byzantine rule; a subject not often covered in other histories of the Empire, but the writer seems unsure of his sources and seems to question his own statements. The book reads like a thesis and lacks any punch or drama that can be found in other works on Byzantium.If the general reader is ever going to learn more about the glories of Byzantium, specialists have got to start writing more intriguing stuff... one would be hard-pressed to know why Byzantine has taken on its modern meaning after reading this book."
2,HORRIBLE editing robs useful book of readability,"Painfully bad editing (so bad I can't believe the editor even read through it). This is the same issue I found with Byzantium and the Early Islamic Conquests (also by this author): poor editing leading to unnecessary repetitions and the appearance of odd paragraphs that seem to free float with no relation to the paragraphs preceding or following. Kaegi knows his stuff and it's well researched, but whomever does his editing does him a disservice. The publisher ought to be ashamed to have let this one by. There are literally instances of adjacent sentences repeating the same point just with different word order. Great opportunity for someone to write and equally well-researched biography and pair it with even a rudimentary amount of copy editing."
2,average,"This compilation is commendable for some reasons and open to criticisms for others.Mr Hvorostovsky has a fine singing voice, unless he tries, as he does in some of the arias, to overdo it, inking and darkening it to scarce effect. A pity because where he keeps it light and soft, the lower voice of an accomplished baritone is ideal to trasmit the sheer sensuality of these pieces.His pronounciation is excellent and he gives the impression of perfectly knowing the words he is singing.A serious flaw lies in the choice of arias: it is never wise to mix sacred with mundane pieces, nor to juxtappose Handel's or Vivaldi's (who both require an individual compilation) opera excerpts with chamber pieces designed to entertain a small audience. The different styles clashes horribly even if the singing technique is distinguished.Orchestration is heavy and the sound engineer has not done a good job."
4,Excellent,Got this cam 2 months ago. Takes amazing pictures. Fitted perfectly within my budget. Comes with 12x zoom which is really good. Can also take short videos with this. I got Sony rechargable batteries for this. Works really well. Overall im very much satisfied with this purchase.
1,"Blurry, Heavy and Unreliable",Unfortunately I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews about the camera taking blurry shots. They mentioned a desire for Canon to come out with a firmware update to alleviate the problem. Well the firmware has yet to be released. Now the zoom lens mechanics work but the camera doesn't recognize its already fully zoomed and assumes it is actually not zoomed at all so consequently stays in the fully zoomed mode. Canon support was useless since 1 year has passed since purchase. It has never been dropped or bumped so there is no error message that would be displayed if either of the aforementioned had happened. They offered a customer loyalty option to turn in my camera and pay another $275 plus $10 shipping for a refurbished and out of date G9. Don't buy this camera!
4,S3 IS Canon PowerShot,I am very satisfied with the 12x zoom and the stabilization of the CanonPowerShot S3 IS. Color is very natural in landscape photos. It would be very nice to have a larger viewing screen.
5,Great Little Camera,"This camera was great. Easy to use, fun to review the photos. SD cards work very well. Video is easy to turn on. Though turning it off, you tend to take your eye off the subject. But I think I can edit the video clips later to have better starts and stops. Camera is small enough to go just about anywhere. and light enough to not be a issue while walking around. Reading the manual and understanding all the features is a bit tough. but the presets work pretty good and I'm very pleased with the purchase."
5,Easier to use than other digital cameras I have owned,Great quality. Movie quality is really astounding.
4,Great except for...,"I love the quality & the speed except for the indoor moving shots. I went to my nephew's wrestling tournement & I put it on sport shooting & I couldn't figure out how to use the flash at the same time & I missed some WONDERFUL shots!! Other than that, it was great & it might be something I am doing wrong...who knows!!"
1,I really don't like it,"Everyone told me to switch from Olympus to Canon to play with the big boys, but I don't see it. Pictures are grainy, flash is overpowering, and the focus is just.. flat and one dimensional. I intend to upgrade, but my wonderfulOlympus Camedia C-4000 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoomtook WAY better pictures, hands down. I'm going back to Olympus."
1,Canon does not support their products,"I purchased a Canon SI IS and have sent it to their Factory Service center twice, it is still not working right. Now that it is off warranty their answer is for me to purchase a ""refurbished"" S2 IS for $199...Their support of their products is terrible, this camera has not worked right since I bought it and they dont care! Do yourself a favor and buy a Panasonic product, they make great products and they support them, unlike Canon"
4,point and shoot,I really am not a camera expert-That's why I love this camera!! Very easy settings to follow. Best of all instant shots. My old camera would cause me to miss great shots due to a delay. This camera takes the picture when you push the button and needs no recovery time before the next shot. If you're shooting the kids or pets in action its a great camera. I know other cameras have higher MP's but you won't miss it with this camera. It shoots quality ever time. Also really like the hold grip and the light weight. Great for the price!
5,A great digital camera!,"A wonderful camera! It has so many great features and with a little reading and practice, you will feel at home with it and be able to do more than you thought you could with it. I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this camera and it was definitely worth it. I love it! I would recommend a 1 GB card, however, especially if you plan on using the video feature. All in all, this camera is worth the money for those who wnat more than a point-and-shoot digital camera; I would say it is almost a DSLR camera, which can be a very expensive purchase for most of us. Highly recommended."
4,Dust inside lens?,"Got this camera after reading good reviews. Out of the box, I noticed there was a couple of dust particles INSIDE of the lens. I then compared it to another new S3 that a coworker purchased- she has dust particles inside her lens. Went to Walmart to have a look at their new S3- dust in that lens. What's up with that? I was hoping to just return it and get one without a dust covered lens. But no, not an option. Guess I'll pay to have it sent to Canon to have them clean it like it should have been in the first place. I encourage all to use a small flashlight aimed at an angle, and look at the inside of the second layer of glass in the lens. Or just look at it in the sunlight. Dust?Otherwise, this camera is excellent so far. Love the movie mode. The zoom produces a surprisingly good image in good light. This camera feels so good in my hand! Too bad about about the dust."
4,Easy to use great pics,"I have owned earlier models of this camera, so the functions are familiar to me. I like the handling of this camera a lot, and it has a high end look to it too.Very happy with this camera!"
1,Zoom lens seems to stick,We want to return this camera because the zoom lens hesitates and sticks when opening. It makes a noise which the other S2 camera I recently purchased. I will be contacting Amazon to see how to return this camera and receive a new one.
3,canon s3is,great camera for price. one of the best digital cameras for taking sound videos. love the 12x zoom.
2,Worse than my Kodak 3.1 MP.,I know how to take a picture with a digital camera and I have been patient with this camera trying to get a good picture out of it but I have reverted back to my old Kodak for picture taking. All the picture's look fuzzy and I have even used a tri-pod. I only hope there is something wrong with it and Canon or Adorama will replace it. If my unit is not defective then don't buy this. I will update my review if and when I get another camera to review.
4,Does this Camera have date stamp on Pics,With previous Canon models didnt have date stamp on picturesLooking to buy this camera if it has date stamp on the picture
5,Great Digital Camera with a lot of features,"I would say this is one of top few digital cameras as non-DSLR group.Photo is great as non-professional user and a lot of features.Image Stabilization works nicely and many photoshop-like features in camera.Especially, I like the feature of recording movie with optical zoom.Yes, you can record movies like camcorder. You don't need seperate camcorder for your vacation.2Gbyte SD card can record upto 1hour with full resolutions.One thing I want to mention is the quality of LCD is not that great. It looks little blurry to me.It is the best choice at moderate price."
5,Great camera for price,"I love my Canon S3, has a great zoom and good quality pictures. Shutter speed can be a little slow, and sometimes I have had blurry pictures if I haven't kept the camera completely still.But overall it is really great camera both for indoor and outdoor pictures, have taken pictures sailing, skiing, low light etc, all came out in great quality."
5,Great bang for the buck,"It's a bit heavier than expected, but the picture quality is excellent. Object up to 3/4 of a mile away can be brought into fairly sharp focus. Love it!"
4,Impressed!,"I took my time upgrading from my last digital camera and researched several before buying this one. It is not for a first time user, or someone not interested in a feature rich camera. For example it has a flash but the flash is manual, and it is a bit bulkier than a most. But if you are thinking some day you want to upgrade to a true digital SLR, this is a great and cost effective first step or alternative. The ability to easily try out many cool features and add additional lens capability is great. What I love most is the fabulous zoom capability, and the fact that this camera also shoots movies with sound and does a great job at that too. It will take standard AA batteries or rechargable and for all it's power, the batteries seem to last a good long time. Downloading images to my laptop is effortless, something I struggled with on my first digital Fuji camera. For under $350 this camera is worth the investment."
4,Camera better than expected,I bought this camera on a whim and was quite impressed on how quick the shutter speed was for a digital camera. It was much better than my nikon coolpix camera.
4,Great close-up pictures,Love the camera. It takes good pictures. The 12x optical zoom is justwhat I wanted for close-up pictures from a distance. Macro pictures are perfect and not blurry. I was able to get a picture of my cat's face with his tongue out just when he was getting ready to clean himself. The shot couldn't be more perfect.I still have a lot to learn as far as features.Looking forward to taking action pictures of my grandchildren as they play.
4,Good for the price.,"I bought this one because sometimes it's inconvenient to carry DSLR around and it serves that purpose well. The camera takes pictures pretty fast and the quality is decent when there's sufficient light. It has a big zoom but the close-up doesn't seem to work well. All said, I would recommend this to anyone who has the need to complement SLR with a P&S."
4,My First Digital,"This is my first digital camera. Yes, I am one of the last few holdouts. I have bought digital cameras for everyone in the family except me until now. The pros of this camera are a great zoom, relatively small size, great price for the features, and easy to use. The cons include no hot shoe for an additional flash and the digital view finder is really annoying. I may upgrade in the future to a digial SLR but for now this camera takes great pictures and I am finally in the new century!"
5,Love this camera!,"This is the perfect step away from a digital SLR. Lots of features yet still very easy to use if you'd prefer an automatic setting. Takes gorgeous pictures. As always, Amazion service was terrific."
5,Love it.,"For the price of this camera it is amazing. There are many fun color editing tools. The size is just right for quickly grabbing to take somewhere, but not too small too lose instantly. It is an extremely nifty camera for those looking to experiment and get good quality pictures, but aren't looking to buy a thousand dollar camera."
4,Ok,"Its an ok camera to take to places where i dont want to risk bringing my PRO ones...althogh i already had some problems, it didnt work just after year i have it...cost me about 4150 to have it fixed"
3,Canon S3 IS,"This is my first serious camera sonce buying an old DImage from KM years ago.Forst of all, it takes great quality photos once you learn how to play in manual and creative modes.It dosent offer the latest in specs, but Canon has done a good job at making the camera friendly to use that is makes getting to its limits that much easier.The only downside is the somewhat rickety body that makes it feel more fragile than other cheaper P&S; units. The handgrip flexes and the memory card door dosent exactly fit flush.Its also a little more expensive since you have to spring for a charger and a lens hood. (Sony includes both in their H5.)Hopefully Canon can include a bigger LCD and a more solid body in the S4.I'd recommend buying a cheap memory card reader so that you wont have to connect the camera via USB port and save that USB door from use."
1,Fatally flawed,"This camera was a Christmas present. For three years & across 7 national parks, I have tried to use it. But the low-resolution viewfinder and underpowered LCD backlight make it just about impossible. If youre under a tree or its gloomy, its ok. If its gorgeous and sunny, youre literally shooting blind. Too bad since image quality is good -- but with useless LCD and viewfinder, this camera is a huge disappointment. And its a small thing but the lense cover is constantly falling off. Should have been a great camera -- but fatally flawed."
4,Flash sensitivity,"The automatic Flash doesnt work fine.. There were a lot of instances when I thought the natural light was dim and wanted a flash...but the flash just wouldnt go off..and obviously resulting in dark images. And i still haven't figure out how to switch the Flash to ALWAYS ON mode... Otherwise, I like the 12X zoom and Image stabilization..."
5,perfect camera,"This is a perfect camera and I'm so glad I bought it. Amazon had the cheapest price around and I wouldn't trade my camera for anything. Now I can click away and not have to worry about wasting film - and I get better pictures, because I can take more, and therefore have more to choose from."
4,Generally pretty good,"The good:fast; mid-weight, plenty of shooting options. I like having video hence no need to jump to an digital SLR.The bad:software a little clunky, camera view finder could use more of protruding rubber shield - I only like to shoot through view finder and find this aspect too much like the cheapy quick point shoot with too much light distraction from perhiperal."
1,dont waste your money,To out dated not worth the money. No camera that takes double a batteries is worth spending over 200 dollars on! Its a junk camera canon made. I suggest to not buy this one there is another that takes a lithium battery which is the one I was looking for.
2,Not bad,"This product is extremely outdated now.Cameras are smaller, faster, work better, take better photos, and are more user friendly.It still takes good photos, but there are much better options these days.In its day, it would have earned 4 stars.Compared to what is available today, it gets 2."
4,Love those Canons,"I purchased this camera to replace a 4 MP Kodak EasyShare camera at our office and I can heartily say it does not disappoint. The learning curve isn't too steep and it interacts very well with computers to offload images and movies. iPhoto loves it and even grabs the movies, something it wouldn't do well with the Kodak.It's value for the cost is quite high."
5,Canon PowerShot Pro Series S3 IS 6MP with 12x Image Stabilized Zoom,"Very good camera. Macro mode and movie mode are amazing.I expected more from 12x optical zoom, but maybe I'm not soexperienced and never have had deal with this kind of cameras.I thought that 12x should give 7x-8x magnification but inreality I have something 5x - 6x. Battery life is real surprisefor so big camera and I won't be worry about recharging.I recommend this camera for novice photographers like meand I need to learn lots of features and manual."
4,Excellent camera but has some minor issues,"It has great features and the image quality is just superb. An excellent camera all in all. But the lens cover does not fit tightly enough and tends to fall off even while putting the camera back into its case. The lens cover is meant to be so that you do not have to worry about protecting the lens when the camera is not in the cover, but what if it falls off at the slightest touch? You still have to be very careful with the camera.Another thing that it is very bulky. It wont fit in a purse/bag you would normally carry so I always end up carrying it separately.But in spite of this, I love my camera."
4,Great Camera,I always do a lot of research before I dive into any purchase. One of my friends has this camera and really liked it. I like the fact that it has the features of a 35MM but the convenience of a digital camera.There are a lot of features that I don't know how to use but it takes excellent pictures in my opinion. I have done a lot of experimenting with the different settings to figure out what works best.The zoom is really great and I love the flip out window to get a better view of your shot.The one thing that I would definitely recommend is that you purchase at least one set of rechargeable batteries -- it goes through regular alkalines pretty fast!
4,Even I can work this!,"I wanted a camera that was easy to use, that took really good pictures without much import from me, the camera user. This camera does all of that and moreover I have become fascinated by all it can do and what I can do with it. The photo software that comes with it is amazing and I have been editing away like mad and am so pleased with the final results, I feel like a pro!! My one criticism of the camera is that when holding it to take a photo my right thumb gets in the way of all the buttons etc or is it the other way around? Consequently I am still trying to find a comfortable (don't have to think where my fingers are) position to hold it. Nevertheless I am so pleased that I chose this camera for my birthday present."
5,Great quality both inside and out,"This camera is ""the"" best camera I've had yet. The super macro mode is phenominal and regular mode has 12x optical zoom. Also, for any AVI's you may want to record, it records audio in 44 and 16, CD quality basically. The screen also flips inside and out so you don't always have to use it if you choose not."
5,a good camera,"its amazing flex-ability and features are worth the money its performance is awesome 12 X zoom & anti shake are spot on , only criticism is it dose take some time to get to learn and program the beast I guess I'm getting a little slow theses days but once mastered it is quite the camera i have owned ,Minolta's ,Olympics ,and other Canons this is the best yet Ihave had it for a month taken over 300 pics and would certainly by it again"
2,Disappointment,I was really disappointed in this camera. When I first got the camera I noticed the pictures were very noisy. My Nikon point and shoot had much better quality. Then right before the warranty went out the lcd screen stopped working. I have tried to find my receipt but haven't had any luck. So- I probably have paid 500 for a camera I got to use for nearly a year. Not a good deal. I strongly urge you to look for another camera.
3,Like it when it works......,"We have owned this camera for about a year now and most of the pictures turn out nicely. Video works much better than our last camera. I love how far it zooms without making image fuzzy. However I went to turn it on last weekend and it flashed at me and went off, so I changed the batteries and had the same problem.. It's now in the shop thank goodness we bought a warranty. The lens cap also keeps coming off.. Hope it gets fixed"
4,Very good but a bit complicated,"Its a nice camera with possibly all d features which I might want to have...the only downside is that its a bit 2 complicated for amateurs like me..this is my first digicam but I'm pretty much satisified with its performance though i havent been able to explore it fully...the zoom is just amazing and gives you a feel of an SLR...for those who dont know abt this camera, they'd probably mistake it for a low end SLR..On the whole, its a good buy and value for money.."
2,Canon PowerShot Series S3,The menu button is poorly placed as it gets pressed just when I need the viewfinder to take a picture. Sometimes in poor light it will not always focus. It usually under exposes. Otherwise I like the camera.
4,solid camera,"No fuss camera, with many functions and a so-so build. Entry level professionals may want to go a bit higher and go for an entry level DSLR. For the rest of us this is one of the best options available on the market."
4,Good Camera but I have one issue,"I have had this camera since September, 2007. Overall an good product and relatively easy to use. I do have one question to the other users. When I take a vertical image, it is cropped on both the right and left sides. In other words, the inage appears in the middle and black lines on either side. I contacted Canon and they said this is normal. I have a hard time believing this. I have had other brands of SLR's and an Olympus digital and this never happened. Can someone tell me how to override this and if I take the memory card to the store for prints, will this image have the same lines on either side?"
5,S3 Review,"Excellent value balancing price with capabilities. 12x optical zoom is an excellent feature and the higher resolution, newer models are not worth the extra cost."
2,Don't buy this camera if you want macro,"In all fairness to Amazon, I need to write this review. I just returned my Powershot S3 IS because it did not do what I needed it to do. The ability to take macro photos is critical to me and this camera, despite claims to the contrary, does not have any real macro capability. The reviews on this page did not mention the macro mode in any substantive way--and now I know why.In macro mode, the zoom function is very limited. Only about a fifth or less of the 12X zoom can be used. After that, the camera will not focus. The field of view is about the size of a sunflower, if you are shooting flowers. I couldn't figure out how to shoot objects the size of bugs or coins without cropping. In supermacro mode, the zoom is unavailable altogether.This may be a very fine camera for other purposes, but if you want to use the macro mode, don't buy it."
4,Wonderful camera,"I purchased both the Sony Cybershot and the Canon Powershot and ended up returning the Sony. I found the Canon to be more user friendly. We only came across two downsides: the flash and batteries, but easy to deal with. The Sony was nice, but it was slow between shots, felt clunky and I didn't like the location of the buttons. Both are good cameras, I think it comes down to personal preference."
4,Nice.....but has some bad points,"It has some great things: an awesome super macro mode, great 12x zoom, but also some annoying little factors: icky aut-focus and difficult manual focus, tiny and not clear LCD, horrible fake viewfinder.I got really annoyed, especially when taking macro pics because the LCD made it look as if the picture was in focus, but when I uploaded the pic, it wasn't in focus at all! Maybe it's just because I'm not a great photographer?Overall, its a nice cheap camera for amateurs...but maybe there are better choices."
5,I'm Delighted with the Camera,"I'm very, very happy with my S3 IS. I previously had a Nikon 4800; this camera is easier to use, much faster and takes better pics."
5,Excellent,"No complains yet. Good pictures, good zoom, good image stabilizer, lots of functions, good price.Summarizing, excellent camera."
3,Not what I expected,"Well I bought this camera yesterday to replace my olympus sp-500 because i was impressed with some shots my friend took with hers. took it to a dance recital, it killed my rechargeables after about 5 pics. had to run to store and picked up 2 xtra packs of batteries. put first 4 batteries in and didnt even have enough charge to shoot a picture. put second set of batteries in and it shot maybe 3 pics. well needless to say, i would like a camera that if i ran out of rechargeables, i could run out and use regulars in a pinch. not sure if this particular camera was a defected model or not. i exchanged it for an olympus sp-550."
3,Too professional for everyday family pictures,"This looks like a great camera. But I'm not a professional photographer. I'm an average person when it comes to electronics. I got this camera because I wanted to take pictures of my kids as they're growing up. You know how kids never sit still. So it was either blurry pictures for us, or insanely bright pictures from all the flash that had to be used to get a semi decent picture. I tried looking up how to solve this problem in the manual and their solution for blurry pictures was ""use a tripod"". HA! Why didn't I think of that?I don't know if there was any other solution because honestly, I do not have the time to read every word in the manual to find out. It's too technical for my use and I need something straight forward. I also wasn't impressed with the battery life. It does take great videos though. I can't argue that."
3,Annoying layout of buttons,"I bought the S3 a long time ago. One of the most irritating and lousy aspect of this camera is the ISO button on the back of the camera. It is so easy to accidentally push it that you'll find your pictures are grainy because the images were taken at ISO 400 or higher instead of ISO 80 or ISO 100. Secondly, the image size button is also located in the same area and guess what? It too can be accidentally pushed changing your initial settings to a lower quality/size image. If I'd known that this would continue to occur even after owning the camera for a long time and consciously checking it often, I would have returned it. It's the worst thing that can happen when you're trying to get the largest, highest quality image and you download it to your computer and find out the quality was reduced. Absolutely disgusting."
1,S3 poor quality,"I purchased The S3 with the Image stabilization being the primary reason. I own a Casio QV 3000 EX and a Fuji S 7000. The Casio with only 3.3 Megapixels gives better more natural images than the Fuji. The Canon S3 is the poorest of the bunch. The images on the LCD montor and the Viewfinder are dim and almost impossible to see in any kind of light. Canon told me to take out the batteries and the memory card , let it sit for 20 minutes and reinstall-did nothing to improve the condition. They want me to pay to ship it back for repair and I refuse to do that on a new camera. My rating for this camera is no stars.Tom"
1,Loved it until it died ...,"I loved this camera - until, not too long after the warranty period ran out, it stopped working. Specifically, the image is always black ... the display works OK but it acts as if the lens cap is on even when it's not. Now they want $160 and 4 weeks to repair!I have always handled the camera with care, there were no drops or bumps.This is my last Canon. It's a fine product when it works but I expect more lifetime from such an expensive product."
5,Power with an affordable price,Awesome camera! What more can I say? I am just beginning to explore the possibilities that this camera can do. I take this camera everywhere! The stabilizer is a wonderful tool. Easy to use and fun to have.
5,Great pictures,"Lots of bells and whistles - more than I normally worry about. But, once you get a handle on the camera's capabilities, it takes incredibly clear pictures. Lighting is not as critical as with the Olympus model I had prior.Definitely recommended."
5,Dynamic All-in-One,"I've had this camera for years now and it still continues to impress me. With its swivel screen and interchangeable lenses, settings for super macro and manual focus and so many specialty uses, this camera has everything you could ever want!"
4,Pretty decent!,"Pros:-VERY EASY to record stills or video. Each has its own button. You can take stills while recording video; you can record video with the touch of a button-PC Software-Simple interface for off-loading: usb or simply remove SD card and use a reader-battery life is good using standard alkaline batteries-SD card media. 2 GB goes a long way, and is fairly cheap-Relatively easy to use for point and shoot-Decent zoom-Good image and video qualityCONS:-taking a still while in the middle of recording video causes the video to momentarily 'skip'-Flash has to be manually raised-Viewfinder can be hard to use, not very good quality-a bit large compared to some other cameras.-for 'image concscious' people, this camera has an old-school lookSummary:I like this camera for the price, ease of use, and versatility. The ability to grab video at any time is great."
1,Not a good product,These dry out extremely fast and didn't feel near as good as other brands. I won't buy these again and will probably toss what I have remaining.
2,Not a good product,"Product is so thin it is very difficult to put on. Buckels in on itself and gets twisted. Never had problems with other ultrathin condoms from other brands just this one. Lots of friction as well. This used to be one of my favorite brands too, but in the competition to make the ""thinnest"" product they've pushed the product too far and made it bad."
4,Good Product - Very Pleased,"Fast turn around time. Good communication from company to let me know when it was shipped.Thank you,Cory in Atlanta"
3,Energy Side is taking off. House Side is stayin home,"Jose Melendez is one of the hottest DJ's in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has a hyped sense on what people want to hear. This albulm is part of the variety of flavors which makes the club scene in the ""western gate."" The Energy side seems to start and remain the high point of the music at the time of creation. It'll have you in that upbeat mood through the whole set. The House side is a little different however. It still offers the same variety but it wasn't put together well enough. There were other high energy songs that would have filled the entire CD. So the shift into the house side reminded me to feed my ""dog...house"" ;) Otherwise the CD is a great item to have if you are considering to party SF (Jose) style."
1,Dont waste your money,I am taking a CT cert class in prep for the registry. This book is one of the required readings. I wish it wasn't. It is complete garbage. It contradicts itself MANY times through especially in the post chapter questions. If this wasn't required I would send it back. There are other books out there that will serve you WAY better than this. Look those up instead.
2,Don't get your hopes up on this one,"I loved Bushong's rad tech book, however, this one is no where near that level of quality. Who knows you may like it and it's not very expensive, but I wouldn't get your expectations up very high."
2,the watered down version of CT,"This is for thoes who have no idea about the who, what, where, or why of CT. It offers a good start so that when you move on to a better book you will at least know the jargon. Very contradictory and sometimes just plain wrong."
3,only covers part of the registry,good review of important physics of CT.This however is only a small part of the registry.If you want to prepare for the registry get Medical Imaging Consultants book.
2,NOT beneficial for CT Licensing Exam,"This book is strictly about the mechanics and physics behind computed tomography. This information is only a portion (and not the largest) of the national exam. Additionally, within the first two chapters I found several errors in the chapter information versus the post ""examinations."" This does not provide allot of confidence in preparing for the exam. I discarded this book and purchased study materials through an online source geared to medical imaging and CT. I did pass the examination!"
4,Computed Tomography,"Simple tutorials which explain the basics are assessed by varied MCQ's in an entertaining romp through CT history, physics, CT generations, gantry technology, image reconstruction, spiral CT, special CT techniques and excellent reviews of radiation dose, image quality and artefacts.A very reasonable price completes the package.****"
1,Computed Tomography by Stewart Bushong,"I am very impressed by Stewart Bushong's books. This book is concise, easy to follow and presented in a way that keeps your interest. The last time I performed a CT scan was in 1987. I am preparing to work on a 16 slice unit and this is one of the books I chose to help me get up to par in CT. I have been doing MRI since '87...lots have changes have occurred in CT imaging and I know Bushong can help me catch up!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,This book is really confusing and is not worth the time to study. Unable to really get a concept because the book is very contradicting. Would not waste my time. I just passed my CT registry and had to completley start over with the physics because this is really confusing. Do not waste your money.
4,High On A Hill,"I read this series out of order accidentally, and this book was not at all what I expected it to be. It was less steamy and suspenseful as #3 and #4. The romance was nice, but slow. This story was more historical than romance. In fact, the whole book seemed as if it was written by somebody else. It wasn't Garlock's usual style. It wasn't bad, it was just different. It was a very sweet story though."
4,Another good book about a simpler time,Another very good book by Garlock about a simpler time with a little mystery and a little romance. I will continue with this series.
1,A waste of money,My Nino has internal battery problems and there is no support for it. It's garbage.
4,"It's a great PDA,but you're on your own according to Philips","I too have a three week old dinosaur. While I love the functionality and feel of the Nino, my attempts to resolve a factory defect with Philips customer support were futile. Their only option for me to get my modem to work was for me to send in the entire Nino (and modem) to them for at least three weeks for them to sort out and fix my Nino. The reason I bought it was to get work DONE, not to be hung out to dry for almost a month!They would not make any concessions or even listen to reason. The manger there even raised his voice to me and flat-out refused to help me.One friendly five-minute call to Amazon fixed all my problems.Philips have decided not to stand by thier product. It's a shame, because I really enjoy the Nino."
2,A great PDA - but BEWARE!,"Everything positive you've read about the Nino is true, but, according to Philips Nino they are getting out of the PDA business. Already, the 'Nino Store' at their Web-site is closed. So, if what you need is what comes out of the box, Buy It! But don't expect continued Philips support, ROM upgrades, or even a replacement stylus. Alas, the Nino has gone the way of the Dodo, and I own a three-week old dinosaur!"
2,Beware of WinCE 2.0!,"I recently purchased a Nino 319 for Windows CE software development. The price was very attractive and the offer included a clip-on modem (which did not work). Much to my surprise, the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit and SDK for VB6 DOES NOT SUPPORT Windows CE 2.0, only 2.11. Let this be fair warning, if you intend on developing software for a CE device, buy one that runs 2.11, stay away from these close-out 2.0 devices."
2,Product arrived on time but missing 1 screw,The packaging is so poor that a screw is missing. Please send me 1 screw. I can not use this product until I have 1 more screw.
5,perfect style!,Received this item quickly and in perfect condition. It fit perfectly and easily in the front entrance of our home and is the exact style we wanted. Great website and items are true to pictures.
4,A fun read,"Mrs. Fitz's Flamingos is an engaging read for the younger bunch. It helps children understand that seniors need friends, too. Mrs. Fitz has a great memory of her trip and finds that a plastic flamingo makes her feel better; so, she saves to buy two flamingos every week. The rest of the story is fabulous. It introduces a child to the value of saving and buying a little when you have it versus buying a lot and owing for it. A great short read."
5,Mrs. fitz's Flamingos,"We used this book for exploring math. I have read it several times to my children and a group of children. The thrill of adding up how much she spent during the book kept the children on edge. Some of the children could really imagine the flamingos flying away. I recommend this book for working with adding money, mulitiplication, and just a good read."
3,Awkward Re-Telling of the Movie,"This seems like a movie cash in... though this is my daughter's favorite movie and its impossible to find the dolls and other products that were made around its release so we jumped at the opportunity to get this. And its an alright book, although shrinking the plot into a simple easy-to-read story really hurts the flow of the book. Short enough for a bedtime story for a young one that likes the movie, but those not already enchanted with Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus might not be as enthralled."
3,Lacking magic,"Although the option of 3-d glasses was a fun twist, my four year old found this movie much too scary. The villain in this movie is much darker than in the previous Barbie movies. Even though the rest of the characters are enchanting and the ending is happy, I recommend it to an older viewing group."
4,A fine introduction,"Reading the book does not require prior knowledge and training in linguistics or social theory because the book was written at the really introductory level. The author has intentionally stayed away from using too many technical jargons and dumping too many names on his readers. Thus, it is actually a very good introduction for students who haven't had prior experiences of reading linguistic stuffs. While the book does not deal with discourse analysis deeply, it certainly can provide an entry point for people who would like to know more about discourse analysis."
2,Japanese Ink-Painting,"""Japanese Ink-Painting"" or ""Sumie"" is something that does not exist.Suiboku is the Kanji pronunciation of two Chinese characters -- means water and ink. It's another name for Chinese National Painting --Guohwa.The whole thing is Chinese.Japanese painting is actually ""Nihonga."" It's very different from Chinese painting.The title should be ""Chinese Traditional Painting brought to you by Saito."""
2,COM w/o ASP discussion! What's up with that?,"It astounds me that a 1500+ page book on Delphi 5 programming could present COM and not even mention its use in developing objects for use in Active Server Page development. I'd be willing to bet that 90% of all Delphi programmer questions about COM are motivated by an attempt to use Delphi for web development. And, under Windows - which is where Delphi plays today - that means ASP.It's like writing a treatise on the uses of rubber in commerce and industry, and not mentioning automobile tires.I think Oswald shot Kennedy - I'm no conspiracy buff - but it's more than a little puzzling that this book, along with the Harmon book (Delphi COM Programming) choose not to discuss ASP.What's up with that?"
5,Simply the best Delphi 5 book on the market,"This book contains concise explanations of things I've rummaged hours through other books to find and/or understand, with lots of code examples, and insights into things you just don't find on your own except by accident. My most satisfying Delphi-related book purchase to date, the only thing I'd buy in the future other than new editions of this book (or in addition to new editions of this book) would be anything written by Charlie Calvert, whose Delphi and C++ Builder books also satisfy on a grand scale."
3,Very Good but incomplete,This is an excellent reference as far as it goes.Unfortunately it is incomplete. Eight chapters and one appendix are missing!I know that they are in a PDF file on the CD but as far as I'm concerned that is not good enough.- Reading Acrobat PDF files is a pain in the you know what.- A reference should be available while you are working on the subject being referenced. This is not possible for these missing parts unless you have two computers side by side.- To make matters even worse the PDF file is in a format which does not permit printing. You can't even print excerpts to be used for reference while working with Delphi.I feel that I have been cheated and that a possibly excellent reference has been severely handicapped.
3,Some parts are ok.,I found this to be a fairly useful book. I usually refer to it AFTER I have looked at Mastering Delphi 5 by Marco Cantu. Probably the most useful thing that I found was not in the book at all. It was on the included CD...Chapter 8 of the PDF document has a section on Raster/Vector fonts that I found VERY useful.
4,Not bad at all,I just got a new programming job based in a Delphi environment. I was trained to work in Java and VB; fortunately the syntax was not too different so I picked up this reference book. I was pleasantly surprised to find that a single reference book made the transition go that smoothly.
3,Be careful ! Most of the chapters are only on the CD!,A good book but I was very disapointed when I saw that there was not a CD although it was mentioned to be one included with the book. The CD contains some chapters from the book (11 chapters) that are only on the CD. I wrote an e-mail to Sams but there was not a reply although I wrote them again and again. I suggest you to first check the existence of the CD when buying that title. And to be honest the book is good - maybe not for the beginners- you will find many good chapters like the ones for Win32 API and ADO. Hope I get my CD these days :=)
4,Love It,"Great book for intermediate programmers. Plenty of source code but it's chopped up and difficult to follow. The section on Creating Components was very useful to me. The CD is great, has many undocumented toys on it."
5,I wish I could review it,"I wish I could review it!It is ordered since 1st of December but it hasn't shipped yet (8th January, I've been just consulting my order). It will take 2 more weeks to get here (Portugal)... it's... it's.... AAAaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhhh!Please send it to me right away!ZEE"
5,Great book if you it is your first Delphi DevGuide book,"I was very dissapointed to see that it is almost the same material as in the older Delphi Developers Guide's. Of course there are new chapters, but the biggest part of the book is just transciption of the older ones...Don't misunderstand me - It IS a great book, but if you already have any one Delphi X Developers Guide you can jump over it..."
5,Finally a book that does Delphi justice!,"I have been programming Delphi since D1 and have bought over 50 Delphi books over the years, some I am embarrassed to own. This book is without question, the highest quality Delphi book to hit print to date. Not for beginners but intermediate or better Delphi programmers will find this book to be an essential reference. The sample code actually works! I would have paid twice as much for a two volume set rather then have the CD chapters, however."
4,Beyond 100 Years,"I sometimes look into what is hot whether it is old stuff or newer artists that have made an impression on great music. Recently, Five For Fighting have honestly made some dynamic and quirky pop songs these past few years, since their breakout single, Superman (It's Not Easy) a few years ago. Their latest single does fall in that same greatful category. 100 Yeras, the first track from The Battle For Everything, is a very wonderous soulful blend from the piano and the melody combined. It is just a great follow up to their debut, and it does showcase a slow but gracefully risen edge for the band, against so many manufactured acts. It truly is a great song, 100 years is one of the best songs out there right now, and this single is really as good as they come."
2,"No whiz, no fizz.","The prose in this novel is undeniably Olympian-somewhat on the order of Ruth Rendell on her best days. There perhaps, as they say, lies the rub. The plot is indeed exceedingly thin and it takes forever to wander to its ill-fated and unsurprising conclusion. If there had been even slightly more genuine creepiness (as opposed to merely dark and watery imagery) or plot intrigue, I would have felt justified frittering away the hours it took to consume this book. As it was, I just wanted it to be over long before it, unfortunately, was."
3,"Entertaining read, but nothing new","A good simple read,and enjoyable. Pyper is a writer-in-residence and it showed in that his descriptive passages (atmosphere and thoughts) seemed to be trying too hard. Also a somewhat thin plot. Crane as a charachter is brilliant and would willingly read the next book Crane appears in (if ever) but wont expect a real suprise or challenge"
2,"OK, but...","This is a well written book with one problem: no where in the information contained on the back of the book do the publishers mention that this is not a typical murder mystery, but a murder mystery with supernatural characters. Unfortunately you don't know this for sure until about halfway through. As I am not interested in the supernatural, I did not particularly enjoy the book. Also, Pyper has a habit of forgetting to use pronouns and strating sentences with verbs that gets really annoying after the 50th time. e.g. When normally aone would right ""I drove to the store."" He writes ""Drove to the store."" Sometimes he goes paragraphs without a using a subject in his sentences. Finally, this book is at best borrowing from a far superior mystery novel of the supernatural called, ironically, ""Lost Boys"" by Orson Scott Card, which is a far superior book."
2,Like a bad movie,"Reading this book was like watching one of those awful Hollywood Freddie/Chuckie movies. I also wonder if the author ever parcticed law. His bio says he went to law school, but the main character, a lawyer, is like a caricature from Court TV. I ended up skimming the end, but I guessed it early on. Very a la Hours, by Michael Cunnigham, no insult intended to the latter. On the plus side, his descriptions of settings were very good. Maybe a decent beach book."
3,Life...The Unexpected,"I found Lost Girls a wonderfully, suspenceful summer read. Andrew Pyper delivers a thought provoking first novel examining ""Who we have become...based upon where we have been. This modern day moralistic journey postulates that the sins of the fathers...may not go unpunished. I enjoyed the multiple themes of this unique novel. Ghosts are everywhere. This mysterious, moralistic psychological thriller will have you up late, reading with the light on."
4,Strong debut novel--I loved it!,"Bartholomew Christian Crane is a lost soul of questionable lawyerly morality. His first murder trial is the case of the lost girls, two missing teenagers from Murdoch, an odd little town in northern Ontario. Barth relies on sarcasm and cocaine as he encounters strippers, a ghost and his strange client. Will he emerge from this trial unscathed?Author Pyper's background as a poet is evident from the opening paragraph of this, his debut novel. The story is liberally sprinkled with Pyper's own brand of humor, spiced with unique imagery and the authentic flavor of the north. He had me hooked from the opening scene.If you enjoy intelligent crime fiction, suspenseful fantasy or well-crafted stories, this book is a must-read. But be warned, this is not a typical court-room drama or a brain-candy upper. The story is soulful, depressing and riveting."
3,Atmospheric and creepy,"The cover blurb intrigued me: Big city attorney Bartholomew Crane goes to tiny Murdoch to defend a murder suspect. But something is awry in small-town Canada, and weirdness abounds.What the cover blurb doesn't mention is Barth brought some demons to Murdoch with him, including a nasty cocaine habit and terminal ennui.Andrew Pyper gives us a fine view into Barth's disintegrating personality and his increasing obsession with the town legend. Some very nice atmospheric touches -- I could see the trees and feel the cold, smell the dank of Barth's moldering hotel room.The Canadian locale seemed exotic to this American, and the unfamiliar setting made the plot a little more creepy.A good story, well-written. Recommended."
3,Do not read the dust-jacket or back of this book!,"Whenever I read mysteries I never read the dust-jacket of the hardcover or back of the paperback because it ruins the plot for me. I like to be surprised. The beginning of the book would have been ruined if I had read the jacket, so thank goodness I didn't. This is an entertaining mystery novel, set in Canada. It has murder, a trial, and a gothic ending. My fave mystery writer is Laurie King, but this was a refreshing change of pace. I don't want to give anything away, but if you want a good mystery in a gothic-inspired setting, this book is for you."
2,"I guess the best way to describe my reaction is ""empty.""","I'm not sure what to make of this book. The juxtaposition of the northern Ontario locals and the ""summer folk"" rings true enough - but all in a vacuous, ethereal setting and tone. Is it Erle Stanley Gardner? Stephen King? Mary Higgins Clark? Dashiell Hammett? Hunter S. Thompson? It's all that and less. (I hate it when reviewers divulge plots - and I won't burden you with it here.)I'm going back to the more solid ""meat and potatoes"" (or is that corned beef & cabbage) of Father Greeley's Chicago."
2,Predictable,"I found this book to be fairly uninteresting. It was a very quick read, but I figured out who was whom early on and then just found it to be rather dull to get through the book."
2,Really lacking storyline,I was very disappointed in this book. He just continues to go on and on about his drug addiction and the details of him doing cocaine. I got tired of the same ole' discription of the strippers. I kept reading wanting something really exciting to happen but this book really falls short.
4,Haunting Morality Play,"Bart Crane is a criminal defense attorney with moral values equvialent to the average serial killer. Cocaine addicted and having an unseemly attraction to teenage girls, this character is the embodiment of a thousand lawyer jokes. He is sent to a burnt out little town in Northern Ontario to defend a man accused of killing two teenage girls. Then the atmosphere grows eerie as the bad dreams and hallucinations begin.This novel owes as much to Dicken's 'A Christmas Carol' as it does to the works of Stephen King. The lead character at first seems to be an anti-hero, but by the novels end the reader believes he has transformed into a halfway decent human being.I would recommend this horror legal thriller hybird to fans of John Grisham, Stephen King, or Ruth Rendell.Also Recommmended: 'Julian's House' by Judith Hawkes and 'Something Dangerous' by Patrick Redmond"
5,An amazingly accomplished first novel,"A combination murder mystery, ""lawyer book"", and supernatural thriller, featuring (initially) a throughly despicable protagonist. Not your ordinary mystery, and not your ordinary first novel. Mr Pyper is one helluva writer. Do yourself a favor and read this book. You won't be disappointed."
2,I really wanted to enjoy this book...,"There's an interesting premise, a potentially fascinating set of characters, and a grisly set of deaths all based in an atmospheric town. It should have been a good read. And, it almost was. But...The atmosphere and foreshadowing overwhelm the characters and the story. The tension and the mood is laid in so heavy-handed a manner that it's distracting. It became a chore to plow through this novel to make it to the end (though I did, for whatever reason...). The few 'mysteries' were incredibly predictable. The descriptions were so dense that it was tough to remember what happening in the story, and the caricaturization was so distracting that it was impossible to care at all for the characters."
4,Blue Mood,"This book has a border-line personality. Nothing about it is full blown. The hero,the setting,the plot and the secondary characters are all vaguely creepy.Suggestions of the existence of Evil are hinted at but there is no proof of anything save for life's pitiful relentlessness and its ability to drown you under unless you can outlast, outwit,outdo or simply bow out. The writing is wonderful,but dont expect any easy or neat answers. Read it on a hot and humid day, and then think a long time before you go in for a swim."
2,Lost girls,"this book was a big dissapointment to me...it had the same basic outline as all the other mystery books...if u are an active reader then you will unscramble the mystery after reading 3-4 chapters and then be bored out of your mind at the attempt the author makes to make get you sucked into the story, when i was reading this book i would read trough a whole chapter and at the end find that the author had wanted me to feel a certain emotion but i just didnt feel it. overall for me this book was a waste of time and if i didnt have to write a report on it i would have put it down after the 5th chapter and picked up something else.a good mystery is something that keeps you guessing ... and interested in the book but if i had the choice i would put this book under the label childrens nightime stories because even little kids would not feel scared at this authors attempt of horror."
3,A decent read,"I am on the fence about this one. It was a good read, and the writing was not bad. That said, it was not as ""terrifying"" or ""compelling"" as the blurbs stated. Of course, that is a matter of opinion, and we all know what they say about opinions. ;)As you can see from my other reviews, I read a *lot* of horror, and I may just be immune to the subtler forms of suspense and thrillers."
5,Captures a true insight about Harrahs & Gambling,"This oral history about William Harrah is excellent. I believe the manner in which Kling interviewed all of the people gives you a inside edge to understanding more how the gaming business was run in the early years, and how Harrah help to create a successful industry. This book is definitly worth reading!"
3,arnt ants suppost to TUNNEL!?!,"recieved ants in about 2 1/2 weeks, have had them for about a day and a half...it took them a while to get on the same page, some ants would take sand out, and others brought it back in (werent very team oriented). they seem to be discarding sand, not really making tunnels, like i thought they would. they are just creating huge gaps in the and removing ALL the sand from the sides and off the top. if they keep at it, there wont be any sand left for them to tunnel through! they are very entertaining to watch for both myself and my 3 yr old, i just wish they'd do more tunneling and less ""shoveling""! i think next time i will be getting one of those ant farms, like they made when i was a kid (...one that they couldnt ""toss"" all the sand out of!)"
2,Better Hurry and Enjoy Them,Our ants died in about a week. It was fun to watch them for about a day. Better to just watch them outside. This product is not worth a dime.
1,WARNING! They sting!!!!,"The ants are red carpenter ants... and they are dangerous! Google information.The instructions say to feed them, so I put in a small piece of food in and was poking it down when I felt a sting. An ant had crawled up and bit my finger. It felt like a hornet sting for 8 STRAIGHT HOURS until I finally passed out from exhaustion - at this point it was 230am. The only slight relief I got was running it under ice cold water and wrapping it tightly with a dish rag, every 5 minutes. When I woke up a few hours later it STILL stung, mildly and was tender for the day...I AM SO GLAD IT WAS ME AND NOT MY 6yr OLD SON!!! He would have been hysterical, and probably would have involved an emergency room visit. NOT cool..."
2,Joseph,The ants come seperately and cost additionally. The setup was also difficult and messy. I am very disappointed. The product was a huge waste of money.
1,Disappointing product for teacher and students!,"I followed the directions exactly as they were stated, added the harvester ants I ordered, and by the end of the day my students only had about half of the ants to observe, as the rest died. My coworker added ants from the same shipment and they were thriving immediately. The only difference in our experience was the habitat. She used a more traditional ""rectangular"" shaped ant farm and by the day's end she had several tunnels and all of her ants were alive. I would not waste my money on this product!!!"
2,Helmet for who? A doll?,I bought this for my daughter who is almost 4 and there is no way this is for an average sized toddler. This is not a snug fit at all. Very cheap. I am returning mine soon and going with something that will protect her brains if she falls off her skates or bike.
2,choo choo train with remote,"THis product was fun for a three year old, but didn't last but a week. I sent it back to manufacturer with expense to me, theysent me a replacement, it also failed to last. I DO NOT recommend this toy for durability. I is a good idea but poorly made.I also had a very difficult time getting a hold of the place to send it, person to talk to and no one seemed to understand English."
4,My first choo choo train,"My almost 3 year old son absolutely loves this toy. He takes it everywhere except for bed. We do not use remote control at all, he just pushes the train. It is not very durable - one wheel is already off - but it the toy took a lot of abuse. I bought one for a friend's son also. If you kid is into trains, get it."
2,Wrong color!,"When I ordered this product, there was only ONE COLOR shown and it was honey purple. That's the color I wanted, but when the product arrived, it was NOT purple at all! It was BLUE! I found this very disappointing because it was a Christmas gift for my daughter, whose favorite color is PURPLE. By then it was too late to do something else, so I just gave it to her anyway. It was not the end of the world, but it would have been better to have received what I was expecting to receive."
5,A Great Single,"Wriiten for the movie ""A Life Less Ordinary"", it's a very distintive techno-rock song with a dreamy quality. Sound production quality is careful and intricate, as one would expect of Beck. I can't tell you the number of times I've had this song on in my car or house and whoever is there immedialy wants to know what it is. Recommended highly..........."
5,Homemade Cookies cook book,I have this book and ordered it for my son for Christmas. I have always loved Better Homes and Gardens magazines as well as their cook books.
3,Buyer Beware - Missing Eight Seconds is Never Coming,"Like others have stated, this DVD is missing eight seconds from the original broadcast. Not just any eight seconds, but a crucial eight seconds with just 0:38 remaining in the game.I have contacted NCAA On-Demand about the issue and they replied that ""We checked with our labs who have the master tape on hand, and that footage is missing from the master tape for whatever reason....we will not be issuing a ""corrected"" version of this game."""
4,1987 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship - Indiana vs. Syracuse,A great video of good quality. Perhaps one of the most exciting college games ever. Only disappointment was there was no post-game interviews on the DVD.
1,...,"The title says it all and so does this,I returned the book the day I got it.The authors name is BS and the book is too!If you want to copy pictures like this author does,than first outline the drawing,then add the details and copy the drawing.That is the BS technique and style.If you want to learn how to draw different poses and your OWN comics dont get this book unless you like being disappointed.I am sorry but B.S needs to make better art books than THIS!Ive got a good idea for him,show how to figure draw and maybe Ill buy the next DBZ book."
1,"wow, im really annoyed","...this book really isnt what its up to be. it takes the base shapes and just keeps adding detail. o real great,you dont even get to draw or learn about the poportions(pardon the spelling) this book is a not for any collection unless u are a very baby anime drawer"
3,It Was OKAY,It could of been alot better but..... once you practice a little you can make up different poses!! it should of had better stuff like background but none of it really looked like in the shows. It could of been alot better.But I think it was worth its money. but it is a good starting point.
2,"Not the best, very dissapoting","I bought this book in hopes of learing how to draw a bit better, and because i love dragonball z and i really wanted the book. Anyway, when i got it i was pretty dissapoted. The totorials are a joke! All they did was take some cool poses, take out the details, and put them back in a little each step. .... .... ...."
2,Not for beginners.,"They are really detailed and hard to draw characters for a novice like me. Good for tracing, but unless you're really good I don't recommend it. If you want to copy something, just look up characters from another anime you like and practice!"
1,a poor excuse for a book,"I was extremely unhappy with this book. For one, we get one, maybe 2 poses of each character, and none in their ""classic"" stance. Goku in a fierce battle pose is one thing, but what if I just wanted typical Goku smile? And there's hardly any Vegeta or Piccolo. I would totally keep my [money] if I were you..."
1,Never received,"I got a notice that the product was back ordered, but I haven't received it yet. I ordered 2 of this product at ther same time and one arrived quickly. I still want it, so contact me with an update."
1,Icorrect Information,"None of the songs listed in the below discription are on this CD. Save your money. If you are looking for Polly Browns hits, this is NOT the CD you want."
1,Confirming review below by P.D. Harris is INCORRECT - it's for a different CD,"The review below by P.D.Harris is indeed INCORRECT - it's not for this CD ""Sweet Dreams"" - I think it's for the CD ""Bewitched"", which seems now to be impossible to get anywhere, except as an MP3 download from the record company at [...] This is important if you are trying to get a copy of ""Up in a Puff of Smoke"" for your friends who are pilots."
2,Poor Storytelling,I was hoping for history but this failed in so many ways. I did not care for the author's injecting himself into the book.
5,Irish rock at it's best!,"Unlike it's predecessors, this release from Horslips strays a little furthur away from the blends of traditional Irish music and rock and enters into more of an Irish-""pop""-rock sound. Excellent music, happy, progressive, complex w/harmonies, jigs and reels... Tullish. This band was definitely ahead of it's time as I guess this release is dated back to the mid 70's, it's still extremely current expecially with the new surge of ""world music"". You can't go wring with this particular album. If you are looking for something a little more traditional, see if you can find a copy of their first releases, ""Happy to meet-sorry to part"" or, ""The Tain"". Both excellent!!!"
1,"Not ""alchohol free""","Both the picture and description show this product to be the ""alchohol free"" version. I ordered this item and received the version that contains alchohol. A full refund was granted."
3,Nice flavor but not quite gingery enough,"Flavor is good but I'd prefer more ginger hotness. I also drink the Prince of Peace Kili ginger drink which I like much better due to its more gingery pepperishness . I bough this because the POP Kili is.a littlte too sweet and I was hoping this unsweetened extract would add ginger but no honey or sugar and therefore balance it to my tastse. Didn't get there since this isn't quite strong enough to overwhelm the sugar. Guess the honey is necesaty to the extraction process. Don't know why,"
3,not complete happy,Well...this product is good on average...but the edges of the head need some lace front glue to finish perfect result.Plus after 5 days they bring me some allergy on my taped area.Anyway good product that need help to put on and can bring allergy on scalp . Washing the wig on the head with the tape glued mess up with the bond too.For myself glue is the best option.
3,Very STRONG Chemical Smell,I have not tried the item because I am afraid to...the smell is so so strong. I have been wearing lace wigs for 1yr now and I like to try out new tapes and glues. I recently met this guy who was wearing a Tupae(sp?) and his head did smell strong but I figured it was just that brand. Well I guess I stumbled on to the exact brand he uses cause it smell the same. perhaps I have a sensitive sense of smell? (I dont think so) but its so strong it could make me dizzy. I am not one for wasting money but I'm not sure If I can give this one a try (Mmm...maybe at the nape of my neck?) Does anyone know if the smells goes away? WOW. STRONG
2,Disappointed in the Color,"I was very displeased with this item because it is not truly purple, but rather more of a mauve/brownish color. And I specifically wanted a PURPLE teakettle, because I own a backpacker hostel called The Purple House, and everything in the house is purple. So it was a let down, and since I live so far away in Panama, and my parents brought it with them on their annual trip, I will probably never return it. But if I did live in the states, I would definitely return this item. Sorry, but true."
4,Pretty good,These phones are not too bad. They deliver good treble effects as well as decent bass. A prety good buy for the $$$.
3,such a different feel...,"Londons attempt at the revival is seemingly successful with this good cast Album, however it is barred, I feel, by a few interesting performances that don't live up to the standard. Firstly, contary to alot of other views, I think Ute is fab! a great Velma, but I found Ruthie a shocking Roxie she warbels through her songs in a poor fashion, also shocking is the guy playing amos (sorry can't remember his name!). But generally it is a really good recording and worth the buy for Ute and the rest of the cast!"
4,DROP DEAD JAZZY!!!,"I am not implying that this wonderful musical is 'jazzy' but it is sleek, cool and oozing with brilliance! This could easily have sounded like a tacky kids' musical, but it has been made to sound like a modern masterpiece. Ruthie Henshall is SUPERB! Quite definately the best actress in a musical I have ever seen or heard. The only criticism I have is that the recording does sound a bit honkey-tonk and a touch too raucous for itself. Everything is though is SPOT ON!!! I would recommend the Broadway Cast for the band but not for the singing at all! It is the other way round for this. I URGE YOU TO BUY THIS NOW!"
4,"I love Ruthie, But UTE WAS HORRIBLE","THis is an American play. That means use American Accents. Ute's voice is good, but Ute did not have Bebe and definitely not Chita's skill in speaking with the american accent. That heavy German threw the whole thing off because everyone else got it right. But even with that, this CD is the bomb. Kander and Ebb are amazing"
3,"Good, but...","...after seeing a bunch of raving reviews on this one, I have to say something. Ruthie was great, but Ute was not good as Velma, and all those negative remarks on Bebe, who was much funnier and less hysterical, are quite annoying. Ute has an accent that's anything but American, and her shaky hyper voice is called overacting. I also prefer all the other Broadway cast members to the London cast, except Ruthie. She's really great."
2,What a disappointment,"Granted, I have not seen a stage version of this show, I have only seen the movie. However, I am a bit of a snob when it comes to vocals on a soundtrack like this one, I want some real singers. I had purchased the movie soundtrack because it was the only one available where I live. When I saw what was available here, I thought I would get a professional, stage version with some really great vocals. I have heard Ruthie Henshall sing before, so my expectations were high. I was really disappointed with this version. The singing was weak and the tempos on some of the songs just did not sound right. The vocals on the movie soundtrack were better and the American accents on this version were strange and affected.I would recommend the movie soundtrack to fans of the movie."
3,A great book if you already know the material,"This is definitely one of those books that gets better the longer it has been since you used it. I used this book in a first year graduate e&m course and found its explanations to be over simplified. The chapters leading upto and including electromagnetic waves are fairly standard and decent. However, I felt like the treatment of more advanced topics, like diffraction, was inadequate. Now that I am past this book and have used most of the topics in my job, I find that its a pretty decent reference text. Since its less ""mathy"" than Jackson's, its easier to find the results and read a quick paragraph about it. However, for actually learning the material the first time, I would not recommend this book."
5,Challenging but well worth the effort for motivated students,"An excellent textbook on classical dynamics for the 'grown-up' student who wants mathematical rigor along with physical insights. Working through this book requires considerable effort and thought on the student's part, but is well worth the time spent. Highly recommended for the serious student who is not afraid of hard work."
4,Clash of the Titans,"UFC production values are consistently good and this was a very good overall card, the main fight was quite exciting and was worth the hype."
1,"cheap construction, bad performance, static/fading when...","These headphones are one of the worst purchases I ever made. They look cheap, feel cheap, as if they're about to fall apart. The sound quality fades and gets staticy when my laptop moves. Sometimes you can even here the lowest level of static when the laptop is not moving. It's extremely annoying. Additionally, the headphones have terrible staticy base, and horrendous treble as well. You're better off with a 2.50$ set of headphones that fit in your ear, if you want to be cheap, or if you want wrap around headphones, get something else. This has got to be one of the worst purchases I've made in the last year."
3,Nice sound and fit. Poor durability.,"Mine broke after about 2 months. I think it must have been a short. I could probably get them fixed under warranty, but they're so cheap I'll probably just order another pair. They're good when they work."
4,It's Audie Murphy.....,"Ya gotta love an Audie Murphy movie! I love Audie Murphy movies. My top three cowboy heros; John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart and Audie Murphy. Ya just can't get any better.This flick is another good cowboy movie that Audie did. It doesn't matter what the plot is...Audie did the acting in his own great way and got the bad guy, won the girl and saved the day. Ya just can't get much better. Cookie cutters in this case... are not important. It's Audie. Ya gotta love the guy and this movie. Go buy it. It will make you feel good."
2,Save your money,"There are a couple of problems with these sheets. First, you are paying $10 for 15 sheets of paper. There is one sheet per character class, which means you'll be making lots of copies. Two, they are just too small. The information is crammed into these sheets, so prepare to write small. There are some better options. One, just photocopy the sheet that comes with the PHB. Two, use the character generator CD-ROM that comes with the PHB. Three, download one off the internet. Four, create your own sheets. All of these options are, for all intents and purposes, free. I found a much better sheet online that has a lot more room to write things, so I don't have to squint to see what I wrote. I will say that the layout of the sheets is actually good, but there just isn't space. I would recommend not getting these sheets."
2,Not well thought out.,"These PC sheets have too much black in them, the boxes are too small, and better sheets can be found for free on the internet constructed by players who care. Too black, they don't copy well. I have found some excellent PC sheets out there w/ nice big boxes to write in and I 'save as' and then type my PC info in (anything that doesn't change) w/ page #s of where I can find the appropriate rule. They could have referened page #s on there sheets it would have helped all of us learning this new version."
4,Quite useful,"If you are a D&D player who plans on adventuring in 3rd edition this is a definite pick-up. Inside are several character sheets 1 for each class and 1 for Multi classed, along with the authority to photocopy them as needed for personal use. These sheets will save you alot of time and trouble, each lists every skill on the sheets whether you character has that skill or not he is going to need a majority of them because a new rule in the game allows you to use certain skills even if you didn't put points into them. D&Ders pick these up they will save you a lot of heartache."
4,Pretty Good,"First and foremost, if you want to play Dungeons and dragons, you should get this book, but some people disagree. It is pretty good to have the sheets, especially if you already have a photocopier (becacuse they give you the right to copy the paper). I, myself, thik its cool to have the offical sheets and not a rip off of Wizards from the internet."
3,"Not bad, but scarcely necessary.","On the one hand, they're such nice character sheets. They're quite high-quality, and are fairly well-designed.On the other, gosh, they're expensive, and the only one I've ever used was the multiclass sheet. Often they're too focused on the class. ... if you do get it, it's fairly nice."
3,"Not bad, but...","A good sheet to work off of, but you only get one copy of each class. Not worth the money if you don't have access to a photo copier or scanner."
2,Rather [weak],"Honestly, you can find better character sheets for free out on the web, made by fans. This product just basically gives you customized character sheets for each class, with the class already filled in, and all the class skills already checkmarked, and I believe the hit dies were already filled in too. Oh, there is a blank sheet included as well for the multi-class characters. The 32 sheets or so in this product aren't even going to get you started, especially when so many of them are unusable because they're a class that you never play. The sheets are all in black and white, and the paper stock isn't really anything fancier than regular copier paper.All in all, give this thing a pass. Print out something from the web and go somewhere to take a bunch of copies. You'll be much happier and get a better value for money."
2,Extras and that's it,"These sheets are very helpful for a first time player maybe but after playing in a few games and being ushered into house rules central every player I know has a favorite sheet online that is just better. The sheets here are good only because of the spell lists, the companion creature sheet, and the ease of use. Judge what is most important before buying."
2,"Neat, but a waste of money","With a photocopy-able character record sheet in the Player's Handbook, there is really no need to shell out 10 bucks for this product. Chances are, you'll go through many more character sheets than are provided. Even if your gaming group pools together a few dollars each to buy this product, there will not be enough to go through more than a few characters. Save your money for the other products, instead."
1,Worthless,"These sheets are worthless to the true gamer. I got these, and immediately tossed them. Personally, I prefer to make my own sheets on paper, but the program on the CD-Rom that comes with the PH is fine too. The character sheets were only unnecessary examples on how to make a character. You could always use the example in the handbook.Don't buy this. It [blows]."
4,Helpful but Unecessery,"These character sheets are great for everyone wanting to orginize his roleplaying. They contain a place to write pretty much everything you can write about a character, with a lot of room to spare as well. Although these are pretty much the best character sheets I've seen, I'm not sure a player writing his own sheets, wouldn't have done a good enough job as well. What I am saying is, if you have money to spare and are very disorginized, buy these."
1,What a joke!,"Why would anyone buy these when you can downlod .pdf files of the character sheets for free off of WotC's website, or when the Player's Handbook comes with a demo CD of a character generator program that prints out very nice character sheets for free?"
3,"Forms, Forms, Forms","Blank character sheets for your photocopying pleasure. If you have the D&D Character Generator you don't really need this, but they produced it because people like me buy most everything they make (and because some people I hear, don't have computers). The forms are well layed-out but some cursory proofreading might have avoided at least one error on the Barbarian sheet (where they have the hit die listed as 8 rather than 12). Oops. That's what I get for buying something in its first printing I guess."
5,superb study of urban blues,"This is the second most important book that's been written on American popular music. Keil sees blues culture as medicine for the ills of Western Civilization. After introductory chapters on African-American music (in which he makes some remarks on Baraka's Blues People), and blues styles, Keil begins discussing the urban blues, blues played with electric instruments and played in clubs in cities. He has studies of B. B. King and Bobby Blue Bland, plus remarks on many other bluesman. How do they structure a performance? How do they interact with the audience? What are the values upheld in the blues world?"
1,piece of junk,"don't buy it. first, the product could use a picture because the instructions are not exactly clear. I dont think the people at NAPA knew how to use it either. i ended up running out of brake fluid before i could even finish the job. so i had to take it to an auto repair place down the street. in the end, it costs me about 15 bucks for the fluid and adapter, and another 108 bucks to get a technician to finish it."
1,bad product,"I can't believe NAPA sold me this crap for $10.It simply does not work. In fact, it won't even attach to the break valve."
1,Returned after one use,"This was bad enough when, out of the package, this thing had no way to conect it to a wheel cylinder without reversing the check valve (unless you want air coming IN and none going out). Then it got worse - I had 4 wheels to bleed. After two wheels, the check valve didn't check anymore - this thing let air into the hydraulic system - you would think a manufacturer would not want that liability! I finally bought a silicone diaphragm check valve and 3/16"" tubing from from mcmaster and made my own - for about $8."
1,The only good thing is that the pictures are bright.,"There are, what, four words in the entire book? Honestly, it wouldn't have bothered me as much if the pictures weren't SO off. The lizard is bigger than the monkey; the lizard is almost as big as the lion cub who is almost as big as the elephant??? I couldn't stand it and was glad my little one didn't enjoy the book, so I have no problem never reading this book again. Honestly, the only good thing about the book is that the pictures are bright."
4,Tall book,My 20 month old daughter loves this book. Anything to deal with all of the new concepts and vocabulary that she is learning just thrills her!
4,"Features a mommy, not a daddy",This is a cute book. Spoiler: it features the baby being happy to see mommy. So Daddy might feel left out (I guess many baby books are like this.)
5,I just wanted to say...,...that I agree that this book should be back in print. I read it nearly 40 years ago when almost every book was boring (to me) and I found it mesmerizing and wonderful. One of the great stories of discovering the American West.
1,Not worthy of a Pulitzer Prize,"In many of the reviews, they refer to the ""impeccable research"" that was done. I would have to disagree greatly. The lengthy section on the Mormons (I don't understand why he stays focused on it for so long) has an incredible amount of errors and gives such an unrealistic view of the people, beliefs, and even area. Names, places, dates, etc. are wrong and if that's the case with one section that I do know something about, then I wondered how much of the rest of it was wrong. I did like the points of view it was written from which I thought were very creative, but I couldn't handle how it was one disgusting event after another and I ended up not finishing it because it dragged and seemed useless."
5,Best researched piece of fiction about this era I ever read.,"As several others have noted, I also read this book as a teenager (actually pre-teen) when it was first released. It was my first experience with a book annotated with references to research concerning the period.It is every bit as well written as classics such as Tom Sawyer, Oliver Twist, or Treasure Island. I really cannot imagine such a wonderful piece of literature being lost to other generations."
3,So - So,A little too rambling in style for my taste. Not too many surprises with the main characters after the first few chapters.
5,Wonderful Resource for Therapists new to Sandplay/ Sandtray,"This is a fabulous resource for those who want to start using sandplay in their work with clients. The techniques that they offer do not rely on an understanding of Jungian theory. The information is very practical and immediately useful. It provides detailed information about working with non-directed trays, as well as ideas for directed trays. It also addresses issues in using sandplay with children as well as adults and couples. This book has thrown wide-open the door of possibilities. Highly Recommended!!!"
4,A stunning piece of imagery and imagination,"While I experienced the same troubles that the previous reviewer did (cuts off sound at Chapter 8), I was so entranced it almost didn't matter. The director's visual imagery captures you from early on with an image of people described as living dead riding the subway covered in seethrough plastic shrouds. The plot moves a little slow at first but once your into it, it grabs hold and won't let go.It's unfortunate this disc has no extras, as I'd be interested in seeing a trailer for this director's other movies. Also the quality of this DVD is lesser than most other companies (even without the sound error)."
3,Imaginative,"This movie directed and written by Eliseo Subiela tells the story of Roberto, a depressed intellectual, who finds refuge out of his own dull life in a mad family he knows coincidentally. The movie discusses emotional turmoil, major questions of life and religion, and the relationship of an individual to his surroundings. The characters are quite remarkable however they are not well-developed. The surreal scenes are beautiful but many parts of the movie are boring. Pedro Aznar's original score is perfectly expressive of the general theme. This film would have been a work of art if it had more coherence, focus and a faster rhythym."
5,The Thin White Duck,"I completely agree that the editing aspect lacks in this volume. My favorite miss is on page 429, first line at the top of the page, ""...and the Thin White Ducks's..."" -an obvious goof-up of the Bowie alter. That one cracked me up big time and caused me to disturb others in the coffee shop where I was reading it. Being only 24, I can't say (though I'd love to) that I was around when most of these interviews originally came out but as an avid Burroughs reader I appreciate having them all in one place. There is something to be said about the completist aspirations of the book."
5,Best in the series! Themes expertly woven together,This Get Real is the best of all. Ellerbee weaves together themes like popularity and intelligence with school elections and school violence and vandalism vs. safety vs. freedom. Perfect!
4,Not bad,"As stated by others, I do wish the cord connecting the two controllers wasn't as short as it is, but it's a minor thing really. The controllers themselves are light but don't exactly feel cheap.Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good emulator controller set."
2,Good while it lasted,If you wanna buy something buy something that will last even it cost an extra $10 or $20.It was good while it lasted.
2,Buttons are mapped backwards,"I dont know if this is common with these controllers, but for some reason the buttons are all mapped backwards. If you need to press Start in a game, you have to press select. 3 is mapped to 4, 4 mapped to 3, 2 to 1, 1 to 2. It is the same on both controllers. I could see where a simple incorrect or crossed solder point could be the culprit but i have yet to take the controller apart to see what is going on. Other than that, the controller works fine. It can be confusing mapping buttons."
3,eh,"The package says it's not compatible with vista, but when you open the file telling you how to install it says it is compatible. Don't know what's up with that,but I have vista and it seems to be working fine except I don't know how to get it to work with my roms >:|"
4,Works as described.,"Everything works as described, but I give these a 4 star rating due to the uncomfortable earpiece. All else works well, and I cannot complain."
2,I had to modify the male plug for it to fit the Motorola radio,"I was wondering why the radio would go into a weird locked mode in which you could no longer use it. I had to shut the radio off, then turn it back on again. Just a slight movement from the male plug (that goes into the radio), would cause the radio to be unusable.I found out the male plug was not inserted all the way into the radio's headset socket. The problem is the rubber molding around the male plug was too much, not allowing a good ""seat"". I used an Xacto knife and cut away at the rubber molding, thus allowing a good ""seat"" of the male plug. No more weird locking of the radio anymore. I also had to do this with the other Motorola headsets that came with my Motorola Radios as well."
1,not with Motorola MR356,ear bud does work with Motorola MR356 2-Way CAMO FRS/GMRS Radio (Camo) this is a VOX only radio when using a head set.
3,Not good for Motorcycles,"I bought these earbuds specifically for my helmet and ease of use. As it turned out the reception for these at high speeds was unreadable and even worse when transmitting. Not good if you are looking for a cheap solution to communicate between motorcycles. The boom mic's sold by Motorola are perfect for this...static communications this set up is fine, hiking, skiing, something like that. For the purpose that I purchased them for, awful...overall product though, good."
3,Disappointment,For some reason the plug does not stay securely in the telephone. Most movements will disconnect the plug. Very disappointed and would not recommend.
3,Probably great.....,"Probably great for most activities, but communication between two Harley riders is definitely not one of them. Just another failed experiment for me."
1,crap,this mic was good for up to about 30 feet then you cant really hear anything so i dont really recommend this to anyone
2,DID NOT WORK FOR ME,"I know other people use these, but for me i could not get it to stay in my ear? maybe my ears are defective? yes it was cheap, but so what if you can not use it."
2,Don't waste your money,This item broke after 11 uses and stopped working with the radio at that point I discarded it I won't purchase it again
1,Crappy,"If you're in a noisy situation, these things are a piece of crap. You cannot hear one another, nor communicate with one another."
2,cheap stuff,Fell apart after first use. The soft part of the earpiece broke away from the hard plastic. Had to toss them. not word $ 15:99 il buy a diffrent one
1,Issues with Garmin Rhino 530,"I bought this to use on my Garmin Rhino 530 and I had nothing but issues out in the field. Bought 2 of these and wish I didnt. Bad connection and static. Cut out almost every time. Even if we were no farther than 50 yards away. If you have a Garmin Rhino, stay clear of this one. Stick with the Garmin one even if its more money."
2,Motorola 53727 Earbud with Push-to-Talk Mic,"The earpiece and mike are good if the connection would stay in the radio. I am using this with my MR350. Not sure if it is because the connector on the headset is so large or the rubber cover on the radio, but the connection continuoulsy pops out of the radio at the slightest touch, leaving the mike open and no one able to communicate with you. Not sure if this is just with these radios but I would not recommend this set with the MR350's"
4,Recommended accessory for FRS radios,"I have only one complaint about this earbud/mic unit - the cord is too short. Otherwise, the sound quality is good and the built-in mic with PTT works fine. A 2.5mm extension cord from radio shack (meant for phone headsets, #43-2003) alleviates the cord problem, however. The earbud cushion is comfortable. To be discreet, this is an excellent accessory for your Motorola FRS radio."
4,Motorola TalkAbout Earbud,There is a slight delay when you push the Push-To-Talk button on the earbud. However it works well. I receive messages clearly. I'm not a big fan of earbud-type headsets because they do not stay in my ear well and I'm constantly adjusting them. I wish Motorola made a headset that hooks over the ear.
3,Push to talk mice and ear piece,"I am not sure if the problem is the earbud or the two radio set I purchased,the earbud plug does not fit tight in the radios.I think the plug is just a little small."
4,Does the job,"I like how it's a one plug system and not a two plug system like the Midlands. Results in a smaller adapter, less weight, less bulk, etc.Works well on my old T6210 that I use when I go cycling.Only improvement I would like is a volume selection or even a scroll. I always keep my radio in my jersey back pocket and it is hard to reach at times. The convenience of a volume selection would be nice, though it does add costs."
1,doesn't work with all types of Motorola radios,"i order a dozen thinking they would work on all types of radios - but found out they do not. I have two types - Motorola XTN series and MaxOne by Motorola -- will not plug into radios. word of advise, test one before opening all packages and throwing the packages away."
2,Only worked for one evening at work.,"I work for a haunted house in October. I am a manager and lead the technical crew. Our headsets we ordered only worked for one evening. We returned for work the next afternoon and the headsets did not function. The headset I used the night before that I put back on my desk with my radio in my charger - I could only hear squealing and my PTT button was inoperable. All was fine the night before when I signed off air through our head security officer. But then it worked, I had no trouble with it."
4,I Borrowed it and I won't give it back,"A friend lent this to me and I've listened to it about a hundred times. At first I wondered who they sound like- actually, I still wonder, but with the help of other friends I've narrowed it down to a cross of early Dylan-honkytonk Mick (with a spalsh of Elton John- just a bit- don't get scared.I shouldn't have mentioned it.)But they're kinda addictive. I wish I was musically sophisticated enough to describe it better, but I'm not. If I lost this CD, I would definitely replace it- something I usually only do for Uncle Tupelo. So, I guess I'll be buying it since the one I'm wearing out isn't even mine."
2,Not right for your PS3 250GB,"So I bought the new 250GB PS3 and was wanting a stand for it to help with the clutter - I own a Wii and a Xbox 360 as well. So I purchased this and it turned out that it was too big for the PS3. I was so scared that with just one accidental bump or just maybe a little rocking motion from opening and closing the PS3, that this thing would just topple right over. Instead, I put my Xbox360 in it. It was sturdy to begin with but I actually like it in this. There is still a bit of room but I'm not worried about it falling over at all."
3,Best for Quiet Environments,"In my experience, too, the VOX feature of this headset/FRS radio is too sensitive for use in amusement parks, and the like. As noted by other reviewers, hiking and cycling may be the activities best suited for this product . . . but don't position the MIC too close to your mouth when using VOX."
5,"Good, long lasting headset for two ways","I used this headset for about 3 years, first using it on a t289, then upgrading to a t6400. It was used as a convinient way to listen to radio broadcasts in a crowded situation and with a touch of a button, I can easily respond to any transmissions I need to.The only con about this product, is that sometimes I forget that there's a mic near my mouth. Case in point, when I drank from a water fountain or from a cup, sometimes the liquid hits the mic before my mouth, but after numerous times doing that it still works, picking up my voice whenever I press the button.I did try it with the VOX option on, but since I'm a heavy breather it always sent my breathing over the air to other users, so I learned to disable that, but it didn't interfer with my usage of the product."
4,good for price!,"These are light weight headsets for motorola walkabout radios. For just communicating in quiet areas line of sight they are great. If you were at a crowded area like a fair or amusement park, it might not cut the mustard. I am satisfied they are a good value for the price."
1,horrible and didnt work as advertised,"the end plug on the device, didnt work on any of my phones and the coknnection was horrible at bestif i had not thrown out the packagiung, it would have been sent back alnmost immediatelywould not recommend this to ANYONE"
1,MODEL # 53725,"After receiving this boon mic, I found it did not work consitently. Losing contact with lost words, and the mic had to be held to the lips, therefore it was not truly hands free. I require a mic that I do not have to touch to work and can be used with VOX"
2,Not what I purchased,"I did not get what I thought I had purchased, I thought I was buying a headset for a Motorola cell phone, but it was for a 2-way radio. The description for the item I thought I had purchased was not very clear."
2,wrong model!,"The head set didn't work for the radio I had. I should have been more careful. It was a good price, but not if it doesn't work with what I had!If someone buys this, they need to make sure and check their model against the list on the head set of models it works on."
1,Not woth a darn!!!,After spending an inordinate amount of time removing it from the packing it was defective. I was going to say more but it's simply this SAVE YOUR MONEY on this item.
2,No PTT,"Not a bad item, but there is no push-to-talk button on it, forcing you to use that horrible VOX. Heavy breathing, talking to other people (not intending on talking on the radio), any anything else loud in the area will trigger it.If you like VOX, it's okay. Otherwise, there are other options on the market."
2,Doesn't work with all Talkabout Radios,"I bought a new pair of Motorola Talkabout FV300 radios and it simply does not work with them. When I plug it in, turn it on and press the PTT button, the radio starts transmitting and doesn't stop until I shut the radio off. I knew the VOX feature wouldn't work, but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the PTT button. It does not. However, it does work with my older Talkabout which is a T5000, but not with VOX. I'm giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which don't."
3,Not what I expected.,"Not quite the product I expected, but adequate for the price. The voice level required for VOX operation leaves more to be desired. Not useful in noisy situations.Excellent shipping and delivery. Faster than anticipated."
2,not my usual rating for Silver Insanity,The necklace appeared luminous and colorful in the picture. It did not look as colorful as I thought it would be. The beads are strung very tightly on the necklace which distorts the shape. The necklace doesn't lay flat and smooth against my neck. I have purchased several items from this seller and this is the first time I have been disappointed.
3,The picture is deceiving,There are no measurements in the description and I thought this was going to be a longer necklace. It's more like a choker than the long one I was hoping it would be. But still very pretty. Please add the measurements Amazon.
3,A little small,"The advertisement is deceiving. One line states between 6-7mm, and another states 5.5-7mm. The stones are definately a 5.5. or smaller. That is no problem as long as you are expecting that. I was hoping for some larger pearls and did not get them. The color and brillance are pretty though as long as you have a magnifying glass!"
5,Why people pass for other than what they are,"It may surprise readers to learn that many Americans today still 'pass: black for white, and in new ways. Passing is viewed as negative, but Brooke Kroeger's Passing reveals the underlying reasons why people pass for other than what they are, using the lives of six present-day 'passers' to reveal these motives and experiences."
4,Passing,Not much of interest in the book but it was a requirement for a class. But has interesting stories of people who have been passing to be accepted in their community and has a lot of history to show why they felt they had to pass.
3,Not as good as the other books in the series.,"We get a conclusion, but it is unsatisfactory. I feel that the last few pages was hurried and not planned as good as they could have been.But I guess that any finish is better than none.Since I have read all the other books by Piers Anthony I know that he can do better.Read the book. But dont expect too much."
3,Dissappointment to Anthony fan,As an Anthony fan for 19 years I was deeply dissappointed in this book. It was not as well crafted as previous books in the series and the characters and plot lacked cohesion. I particularly disliked the inclusion of the rape and child abuse scenes - they added nothing to the plot and could have been handled better.
3,DoOon Mode,"Theirs would be an ideal romance if it were not for a variety of issues- Colene is a teen ager and Darius and adult, Darius, as king must marry a woman he can draw joy from- and Colene is locked in melancholia, and there's an insane emperor who wants to destroy them. Other than that, Colene and Darius have a perfect love. However, now they have a few more allies in overcoming these obstacles. Clones of themselves banded together with human/animal beings who are part of the emperor's game will help them try to beat the odds, along with the friends who have gone with the couple through the modes of reality on their quest. In this exciting, quirky and strangely hopeful novel, once more Piers Anthony makes use of the greatest magic of all- love, to defeat unimaginable evil.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,At long last,"While living in Europe, brandy was always served warm, a distinctly difference experience. This item provides an economical path to this experience. In addition, the sniffer is smaller and more appropriate size."
3,Old Duutch Brass Brandy Warmer,"Was a gift so item could be good or bad don't know. The companies service as well as the quality of the merchandise was every bit what was promised. If this quality is the standard for this book store, I will order again from this company."
3,simple and fun,I was taken a bit by surprise by this record. I like to find new records before the rest so when I read that they were a cross of bossa nova and indie....i was sold enough to buy it. and this record is SO enjoyable. The girl Juju singing is both sweet and sexy at the same time. Very catchy and hummable - even if I don't understand all the words.
5,Mosquitos Debut CD,"Wow. I purchased this record after hearing a radio interview with Mosquitos recently and I haven't been able to tear myself away from it. At first I couldn't understand just why I was so struck with Mosquitos. Then I realized. It takes me back to a time when as a younger man I met and fell in love with a girl in Rio. It was the mid-nineties and that girl and I never spoke again after I returned home to the states. Then I heard ""Rainsong"" and I felt as if we were reunited. JuJu Stulbach has a distinct way a conjouring old feelings in me. In her lyrics she gracfully weaves between English and her native Portugese language, songs that speak of love, the beach and innocence lost. I will continue to treasure this CD for many years to come."
3,"it's a little bit of this, a little of that","I give the Mosquitos points for making such a catchy polished debut, but it's really just a mix of other bands. Yo La Tengo with Flaming Lips vocals are the most obvious. And if you like the first song, you'll probably like the whole album, but at least it's consistent, right?"
3,snocone maker,"When I ordered the snocover maker the picture was different than the product I received. The picture was an upgrade to what I accually received. I was very disapointed, but it was a gift, and I needed it right away, so I couldn't return it."
3,more grey than brown...,I just purchased these shoes and ordered a 1/2 size up (after reading reviews on other websites). They are a little too big and definately look more grey than brown. They are still really cute though (and you cannot beat the price!)
1,Caution,"I used it for my most anxious cat during a trip. I don't think it helped her, but it would be hard to tell.One of the other cats had a bad reaction after she got ahold of it. My mistake: I accidentally squeezed to hard and got a squirt instead of drops, so I removed what I could, then split the rest among three bowls of cat food. One cat got more than her share and had a bad reaction. I almost had to take her to the emergency vet during the trip. What I did instead was get more food into her. Then, by the time I got off the phone with the vet, she seemed okay."
1,Please don't do this to your children,"I was taught to read this way. It was very detrimental to my later emotional, social and even intellectual development. You are not giving your children an edge up by teaching them to read too early. I feel very strongly that this is a very bad idea.Let them be children. Read to them, and if they pick it up early without flashcards, great, but if you just read to them enough they will become good readers when it's time. Please. Don't do this to your kids."
5,My 27 month old read his first words out loud after 5 days!,"I wanted to give my son the best opportunity to develop his mind and his potential. We began the plan 5 days ago and I was overjoyed when my son (2yrs 3mo) was excited to learn words. He loves to learn, and he hates it when we stop a session. He read his first words out loud this morning after I tried to put the flash cards away. He took the first one out of my hand and read ""rug"", and put it aside. When I asked him what the next one said, he correctly answered ""yes"". This was the reverse of the order in which we had just gone through a list of about 12 words. I can't wait to get home from work to do more words with him. Anyone who has a 2 minute block of time several times a day can get started using the methods in this book."
3,condescending,"Usually, I consider a book for the information it provides but this time I have to criticize the way the book is written. It is terribly sexist, always talking about the 'mother's' role - never the father's. Secondly, three-quarters of the book is just reiteration of the same material as to why you should do this - blah, blah, blah. If you are a busy parent, your child will be beyond the age the book recommends by the time you finish it (the information you actually need is buried near the end). Thirdly, the author recommends making lots of homemade books and games for your child, which would also be great if you have tons of extra time. I seriously wanted to strangle the author by the end of the first half - this book needs a serious edit for busy parents. The one positive note is that he recommends teaching to read through word recognition rather than phonics which is worth trying."
2,Not as impressive as the review,"I've read through this book although not the whole page and find it over-rated.The REAL contents are really little and there's no useful info until Chapter 7. All it does is just tell you WHY it's important to start baby to read early(like i don't know that) and it is POSSIBLE(maybe back in 64"", people didn't think it was possible..but hey, this is 2005, there's no point putting half of the book on justification now to convince modern parents). I think this have to be one of the most over-hyped books for decades!It's not the whole book is crap. It DOES have it contents, but which is not too special and probably any child expert can give you a hint or too...and sometimes, common sense.All in all, i'm not impressed. Definitely NOT a must buy."
1,Worst Product--never worked,"I bought this modem when the modem (2wire Home Portal) I got from SBC Yahoo DSL broke down (within a month.) But after trying this modem/router, I was so disappoined that HomePortal seemed a lot better.The modem/router seem to have an inbuilt PPPoE client, but it doesn't work. In addition, you need obscure parameters such as VCI/VPI information from the DSL service provider to configure it. After you go through the process of configuring the parameters, when you try to connect, it doesn't work. I tried evey thing, including installing EnterNet, using Linux's PPPoE client, upgrading the firmware--but why will it work? After one week of all this drama, I finally returned it.Don't, Don't, Don't, ever buy it--it won't work. If there were 0 stars, I would have given it that."
4,A Must Read if You Are from RI,"I don't think the overall subject of the book will be surprising to anyone from Providence, or elsewhere in RI for that fact, but some of the stories and details in the book will shock you! I lived 1/2 my life in Providence and the other 1/2 in or near Miami. As bad as the banana republic of Miami has demonstrated it can be (Elian!), it cannot compare to the corruption found in Providence and throughout Rhode Island politics. I could not put the book down for 3 days.The only reason I knocked off 1 star on my rating is that the writing quality could have been a bit better. The author rambles in some sections and then seems to repeat himself from time-to-time. The same is noted in some other reviews, so I don't think it was my reading. Nevertheless, it is a minor issue and the book is well worth reading and owning, particularly if you ever lived in Rhode Island. Just remember, it isn't fiction like the Godfather - it really happened."
4,Fascinating lowdown on Buddy,"This is really a fascinating expose on Buddy Cianci. Although Ive lived in the Providence area for a few years, I still had to check myself now and then to realize that this is non-fiction!! Some of the chapters, such as that on the rape accusation, were totally new to me, and it's amazing how they got buried in more recent times.It is also a fascinating look at old-fashioned Northeast political machines, the mob,etc.My only criticism, is that it is a bit choppy with overemphasis on certain episodes and not much filler between. Im guessing this is based on what was available in the Providence Journal archives---so Im thinking the author wa stoo thin on original sources for this book."
3,OK Marine Boot Camp Documentary,"This documentary is an OK ""sanitized for the public"" type DVD about Marine Corps boot camp.Watching this video I can see that todays Marine Corps recruits train every bit as hard as we did in the 70's but one thing is missing....the very *creative* use of curse words that D.I's are capable of. Think along the lines of R.Lee Ermey's portrayal of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman in the movie Full Metal Jacket THAT is the way I remember Drill Instructors as being!"
5,A must see for anyone considering a USMC career!,"I love this video. Probably because my husband is in it! Now I can see exactly what he went through and why he changed so much before and after boot camp. It really puts all Marines I meet in a different light, since I will never join the Marines I can still experience what they went through to become who they are today. It will really help you make up your mind if you're ready to be one of ""The Few and The Proud"""
2,It didn't fit my coffee maker,"Although my coffeemaker model was listed as one that this carafe fits, it was too short. Because of this, the coffee didn't drain from the basket. I live in LA, and can't believe it's so hard to find a Black & Decker replacement! I had to throw out the coffee maker, and replaced it with a Mr. Coffee that cost less than this replacement was with shipping."
4,There's nothing special about it.,It works to spec. What else can you say about a coffee machine glass carafe?
5,Great product,This replacement carafe is better than the original that came with the coffeemaker. It doesn't drip when pouring like the old one did.
3,"Good, but not Best","Prior to our trip to Mt. Rushmore, our family purchased this video and the History Channel video about Mt. Rushmore. The PBS video is okay, but I believe the History Channel video to be the better fo the two."
3,Mount Rushmore's History,"I am always fascinated by what the American Experience series chooses to cover. At first, I thought this would just be about a monument, but it's much more about the man behind it.Mount Rushmore was born of historical circumstances. South Dakotan (white only? Why are the Lakota absent from this documentary?) men needed jobs. The Dust Bowl and the Great Depression were taking place. Often the rock was too porous and had to be resculpted.I love the way the AE series covers America, warts and all. This piece said that the sculptor Borglum was xenophobic, racist, and anti-Jewish, on top of being an egomaniac. It said he choose Theodore Roosevelt just because he was a friend. Clearly I'm not placing this guy in my list of heroes.I enjoyed other works in the series MUCH more than this one. However, if you want to know a bit more about Mount Rushmore, than why not peep this documentary?"
4,This is a great laptop,"I actually liked this computer. Of course, it does not compare to the newer, faster computers of today, but this particular laptop is durable and works great. I had no problems with it. Requires typical pc maintenance and should run like a volkswagon beetle."
1,turn out good,When i first got this thing it was giving me a hard time but it turned out ok after i did the Service Pack updates. So i guess those things really do make a different. Now it rarely restarts by itself.
1,Beware of DELL. They don't support their products.,"Unless you think they'll finally get lucky and produce something that doesn't fail regularly, stay away from Dell. Their laptops fail and they don't always fix them. Mine failed twice with 12 months of purchase and this last time they failed to fix it and blew me off. And I paid for 3 years next-business-day onsite service, yet they refuse to provide it and I've been calling them for 8 days. This is not support. This is screwing users for more money still bailing on them. Don't buy DELL anything."
1,LEFT MOUSE BUTTON BARELY WORKS!!!!,I thought this mouse was pretty neat until I STARTED USING IT! Primary (left mouse button) works ONLY if you press it REALLY HARD. So frustrating. Lame. Lame. Lame. STAY AWAY!!!!
1,So awful,"This mouse was totally unreliable. Half the time, the left-click button would not work. Avoid at all costs."
5,Saints are for Grown-Ups too,"Most of us were introduced to the saints while we were children. As we grew up, our idea of saints has remained on immature level. Thomas Craughwell's book re-introduces us to the saints from an adult person's point of view. The result is refreshing. It is such a relief to know that these 101 saints were not statues in real life. I now feel that Thomas Aquinas is someone I would like to know in real life -- and that Aloysius Gonzaga would be a little scary for his intensity! I left the book by my bed and read two or three capsule biographies each night for over a month. Interestingly, the most moving lives were those of the young saints -- but seen from the adult vantage point of wanting to reach out and protect these youths from harm's way. At the end, I was sorry the book was over. Then on the last page I saw that there is the possibility of a sequel. Let it be!"
4,Saints for Every Occasion: 101 of Heaven's Most Powerful Patrons,I enjoyed the reference material. I purchased to know more about the Saints and I enjoyed the book. I would recommend this book.
5,great compression sleeve for elbow,I recently had surgery on my elbow and the Doctor recommended I get a compression sleeve to help with healing after my cast and staples were removed. I bought 3 different kind of elbow compression sleeves but his is my favorite at half the price. I ordered a medium and its a perfect firm fit for my medium build. I would only order a large if you are a linebacker.
5,Elbow Support for baseball,Excellent product which has helped both of my boys recover from dead-arm fatigue. Worked so well that I ought another one of these supports for both of my sons.
4,Lifesaver.,Took to Bonnaroo. 3 day camp trip. 90 degree hot weather. Size works if you have a relatively close watersource. 1st time owner. Loved product and seller. def recomm.
4,Good BUT Not Great,"Straight up, it's a good pack for light weight hydration on the go. This was a purchase for my 8yr old for Mt. Bike rides. It is ""Not Great"" because unlike my CamelBak, the bladder needs to be worked into the pouch and the fill hole/cap seen in the front needs to be removed/replaced and worked into place, which means if you prefilled the bladder and insert it into the pack, it spills out and soaks the pack. You need to put the bladder in first then fill from the front. Not the biggest deal really BUT I keep the bladders filled and refrigerated at all times prior to use which provides cold water and doesn't allow mold to form in the bladder which often happens when they are left out. Built very well, just more work than my CamelBak to get it going."
4,Works well but difficult to clean,"The hydration pack keeps the water cold for at least 1 1/2 hours and is easy to adjust and use, however, cleaning it is difficult. It is hard to drain the entire bladder after use because of the location of the filling orifice. You just can't turn the pack upside down to drain completely."
3,Good for my purpose,"The only thing I don't like about this is that the water in the tube gets hot very fast, so your first sip if its been more than 5 minutes out in the heat is warm, if anyone has any suggestions to offset this that would be great."
3,Bite valve leaks.,"A great pack ... except the bite valve has leaked since the first use. We got three, and all three bite valves leaked right away ... and are getting worse. We've got a call in to High Sierra ... hopefully they have great customer service."
4,thirsty hiker,I bought this pack because it was not as pricey as the Camelback brand. I really like it. I live in the South and take 4.5 mile hikes several times a week. Feel better having some water along without having to carry anything in my hands. This pack is perfect for that. Not heavy. Fits well. I strongly recommend it.
3,Not Built to Last,"This hydration pack suited me well for about four months.The bladder is removable, but a bit cumbersome. This is NOT the style of bladder with a ""slide"" style of sealing the opening. The only method of refill is via the cap on the front, which can only be properly closed once the bladder is inside the pack.I also found that the unit was difficult to aerate in the interim.After four months the bite valve began leaking. The plastic actually began to deteriorate (not as a result of me being an overzealous biter, as far as I can tell), and would leak all over me during bike rides or runs. Not ideal.If your use of this item will be light and infrequent, this might suit you. Otherwise I would recommend you spend the extra money on a more dependable, higher-quality product."
2,high sierrar water pack,"I purchased a ""High Sierra water back pack"". It worked great for 2 weeks but after that it started to leak. Out of the piece you suck on a stream of water was flowing out all over my shirt. I will still buy one more and give the ""High Sierra"" brand a chance but we will see. I will let everyone know if it happens again. God Bless!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I tried to tell the boy to save up and wait until he could afford better, but being 10, he knew better. Day two: it leaks."
2,"It leaks, moves from side to side when running","It leaks ! the valve does not work properly, you'll lose most of the water because of this issue, moves from side to side when running, should have a larger side pocket."
4,"Perfect size, hard to fill","THis pack worked out great. It is lightweight, holds a decent amount of water and has a little pocket that fits keys and a cell phone. One feature I did not like was the difficulty to fill the bladder without spilling all down the pack. Because the cap needs to be attached on the outside of the pack, you cannot remove the bladder to fill it and put it back in. But it works well and I suspect it will get easier to use."
3,its not bad,"its a little small and when filled, it feels like a big bump on your back, and the straps feel a little small and would be helpful if it had a waist strap also, but it does the job. it does take some time to get the plastic taste out of it."
3,Decent,"Good overall product. We bought two and one of the bite valves doesn't close all the way some times and drips down my arm, the second doesn't have a problem at all. Know that having the filling location directly on the back normally means that the bag itself does get a bit damp prior to use. 1.5 liters is great for light activity, short hikes, walking a few miles, but if you are doing anything harder you should look into getting a larger capacity bag."
2,No cross strap,"It is a good quality bag...small and convenient but unfortunately, it doesn't have a cross strap therefore, the bag keep sliding down on your back once it is filled with water (weight). So, you will be wearing this bag in the lower back rather than up high like a normal backpack."
3,Decent Hydration Pack Back,"Its pretty much what you see is what you get, but for someone particular like me there were two things that stood out to me. First off I use this for my runs and kayaking. The thing I like is that there is a small zipper pocket on the back of the hydration pack. I love this spot for my keys, my last pack did not have one. The thing that I dislike is that there is no chest strap. I have a broad chest so I find the straps slide off my shoulders. My last pack had a chest strap and the pack did not move at all. And lastly, there is no clip or anything for the mouth piece, so It just dangles and I have to tuck it under the strap to keep it from getting in the way."
4,Great for walking/hiking less than 5 miles,"Pack is great! I work with a handheld, so pack is perfect for my walking routes. I definitely would have gotten a bigger pouch if I had to do it again. The only thing I have trouble with is filling it up."
1,No me ha llegado aun el producto,"Estoy extrañado con lo sucedido, pero despues de un mes todavia no me llega el producto, me gustaria que me confirmen cuando lo enviaron, Gracias!"
4,I have peace of mind...,"Ever drop your naked Palm Pilot on the metro floor? I haven't but I can imagine the unpleasant surprise that could ensue. I have, however, dropped my Case-protected Palm on the floor - I think I was more shaken than the Palm.I like the Case logic case - It protects the whole palm pilot, since it closes with velcro there's no 'popping open'. It opens from the top, tricorder style; with a little fiddling, it acts like a stand. One negative: You have to remove the Palm from the case to place in its cradle; but with a little snipping, the HotSync cable fits while the Palm stays snug in its case."
3,"WORTH SEEING BUT, HAS BEEN DONE BETTER BEFORE!","This is a pretty good movie but, it has a ""been there done that"" feel to it. The actors do a good job with what they have to work with and the movie captures the time period without making it look too ridiulous. Swimming as a sport to watch, is like watching paint dry so, that doesn't help the film either. It's worth a look if you see it on cable, as the based on a true story film does inspire you...a little."
4,A Black Rocky Who Swims!,"I didn't know what to expect with this movie and was very pleasantly surprised by it. Every bit as inspirational as Rocky and just as much fun to watch. What made it even better is the fact that IT WAS ALL TRUE!! It really happened!! If you want a fun, inspirational movie for the whole family to watch, you can't go wrong with Pride!"
5,Excellent,This was a very good movie. The story was inspirational and Benie Mac did well for me in a serious role. Terrence Howard is always brilliant in anything he does.
4,An Inspirational Film set in a very Different Era,"The civil rights movement remains an important time in American history. Blatant racism during slavery gave way to the equally humiliating Jim Crow period. Terrance Howard, Bernie Mac and Evan Ross carry this film."
3,Pride,Pride it was pretty good. It goes to show that the right person in any situation cand change thing and people.
1,The LEAST Temptation,"This is the WORST album designated as ""hip hop"" to come out in 2002.Nice samples, Ja. Not obvious or played out at all: Toto's ""I bless the rains down in Africa"" riff on ""MURDER REIGNS"" or ""Funky Sensation"", which has been used a MILLION times before? Come on.Bobby Brown was underutilized, Ashanti's voice is grating and Charli Baltimore STILL can't rhyme. Plus, the ""singing"" has got to go! I thought I'd be happy when Bad Boy fell, but now I gotta wait for these clowns to go under. Hurry up, please!Is he really ""retiring"" after two more albums? I sincerely hope so. I feel bad for kids who know no better and think this is what hip hop is supposed to be.ZERO stars."
1,He went from Venni Vetti Vecci To This TRASH?,"I ain't gonna front, back in the day I was feelin Ja Rule. Venni Vetti Vecci, sick album. Rule 3:36, decent album but nothin special. Pain Is Love, ok, now the guy is pushin his luck. The Last Temptation, wackest album ever made.It's sad to see that Jay-Z brought this guy into the game, but it's not Jigga man's fault. He didn't know that this guy would use his raspy voice (which took him somewhere in the game, not his lyrics) to sing on every song he makes now.There's nothin wrong with a rapper makin a love song, but one after another is pushin it. And then he tries hollerin MURDER INC?!?! If these people are murderers, I don't know what the world is coming to.Like Lloyd Banks says ""How do you want it wit us, when half your label has makeup on?""The ONLY decent song on this album is The Pledge Remix, not cuz of Ja's punk ...it's only cuz of Nas. Oh and to Nas, big up on seein that you don't need these bustas to keep doin ya thang."
1,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GARBAGE,THIS ALBUM IS TOTALLY GARBAGE. I RATHER WIPE MY A** WITH IT THEN LISTEN TO IT. HE'S A RAPPER GONE POP STAR. LIKE NSYNC OR BACKSTREET BOYS.
2,Wake Up!,"I've had to endure Ja's battlecry of ""It's murda"" for far too long. Ja Rule is a perfect example of a formula m.c. He has realized what type of records he needs to create that will boost record sales and make him money. That's why every single he has released has the same format of a pop/r-n-b sounding track and an r and b singer singing the hook. It is a shame that a lyrically talented artist has to go to waste in the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Point black-capitalism is stagnating the growth of true hip hop. There is a group named ""Smylez and Southstar"" that released a song that uses the same sample of Ja's song ""Mezmerize"". Aside from the hooks and the flow of the m.c.'s the songs beats are nearly identical. Now that's creativity. I am writing this review as someone who longs for the days of real hip hop not hip pop that gets mistakenly bunched into the same category. If you think Ja Rule represents real hip hop you need to stop falling for the okey doke and Wake Up!"
1,MORE WACK THAN VANILLA ICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me just say that I do NOT like Clipse or Nelly or Camron or Fabulous or NERD or any other lightweight posers. So my opinion of this disgraceful album is consistent.This is such an insult to real artists like NAS and Common and Talib to name a few, none of whome get as much attention or airplay as Murder Inc's tasteless, self-indulgent crew. ""Mesmerize"" is THE MOST IRRITATING, BABYISH, TRITE piece of garbage ever put out. How anyone could dig that track is beyond me, and yet it gets constant airplay. In fact, whenever I hear that song, I can't help but clench my teeth and pound my fists in the air out of sheer anger and disgust.I also HATE how Ja digs on DMX like ""He wishes he were me cuz I can sing and I have a lot more mainstream success."" I don't think DMX would trade ANYTHING in this world to put out such a blasphemous album as this."
4,Not at his best,"Rule can do so much better than this! He is a good mc but he hasnt reached his potential. Venni vetti vecci was a quality album, there were no bad tracks. As the albums go on they get worse. Now we get to a point where we know what he is capable of but he just churns out la di da songs. He opens with a statement saying he doesnt need to prove himself, then he tries to diss DMX in a later song. He said he wouldnt bark back at Xs remarks!! we dont need another pac and big incident.Where was the change? was it when he teamed up with Nas and the row et al?On the whole it has got some great tracks but he has got too many fillers. The album did only take 12days to record, maybe a little time needed"
1,HAHAHA 2.5 stars!!!,"HAHAHAHA he only got 2.5 stars on average! I can't believe people actually listen to this! ""RAAAAAH MURDAAAAAA!!!!"" Ooh creative lyrics. I want to sign to Murder Inc. - ""the most talented record label in the world"", as Ja Fool says!!! Can you make me laugh any harder?!?!?! I think he should recruit the Barking Dogs to join his record label - they'd be his best artist!!! His primate boyfriend Ashanti should get back in her cage while this guy screams out more brilliant lyrics like ""Murda fo life dog""!"
3,SO..SO.......................,THis album could have been a hell of a lot betta. Ja rule screws up with song like Pop ... and the intro is just stupid. But i think he really shows off his talent in the song Warning this is just a great song. But i kinda reckon he tries to take after Tupac too much
3,A softer almost pop album...,"Ja Rule's The Last Temptation is a much softer album than his first 3. Ja comes through with a sound that is very appectable to radio. Tracks like ""Thug Lovin"" feat. Bobby Brown, and ""Mezerize"" feat Ashanti have a great sound. However, they are very simple songs with simple hooks.My favorite songs of the album are:The Pledge Remix feat. Ashanti, Ja Rule, Nas and 2PacMurder Me feat. Caddillac Tah and AlexiConnected feat. Eastwood and Crooked IDestinyIf you are looking for a gangsta rap album you should buy Ja's earlier records or DMX or Nas."
1,"No rap, just a ...","Ja rule is ... up the hole industrie, no talent, no rap, no good productions. Tha hole Ink. .... Ja rule doesn't even have a nice flow or some. Ya'll betta going to buy Snoop Dogg's cd's"
1,"I smell pussy, is that you Ja?","Sure there is one or maybe two good songs on this album.... IF KYLIE MINOGUE WAS SINGING THEM! Damn right im on 50 cent and dmx's side, Ja rule is a fake. Boycott this album to save hip hop"
2,terrible,As a major Ja Rule fan i was very disappointed when i bought this c.d.. i bought this c.d because i had the last c.d pain is love and that was good so i tryed this one and now i regret it. i dont even think it's worth listening to. this c.d. was so bad that it mad me stop buying real c.d's before i listen so now i get burned copies. it's not even worth burning.the c.d gets 2 stars1 for effort and 1 since im a fan
3,Coulda ended betta!,"Dis album wasn't really an album u would expect an artist who's leavin music to end wit. Dis is mo of a middle down stage album. It's not as good as his previous records and I hate 2 admit but I think dat Ja Rule played da game a bit different to every otha artist. Insteada goin from bad 2 good, he went 4rom damn good 2 flippin damn well bad! Dis album wasn't amazing. He tracks are very close 2 what Nelly's are and Nelly's anotha 1 who's drivin this road. Da only decent tracks I think are ""Mesmerize"" wit Ashanti and ""The Pledge"" remix wit Ashanti, Nas and a 2Pac sample. Oh well, hopefully if he comes back, he comes back much MUCH more harder dan what he left us wit. Ja can stay in da movies and think 'bout his next album for a long while. I suggests he listens 2 mo 'Pac and B.I.G while he's off da scene!"
2,WHAT I THOUGHT BOUT 'LAST TEMPTATION',"Man, I rememba when Ja came out on ""Can I Get A..."" wit Jay Z and Amil and on ""Holla Holla"", thats when I wuz feelin Ja, but when he busted out wit ""Thug Lovin"", I lost my interest in him. And Murda Inc. thought they wuz all dat when dey said dey had Bobby Brown on Ja's CD...I wuz like PUH-LEZE!!! But even though I don't like Ja, his CD coo but neva betta den tha othaz. The best song on ""Last Temptation"" to me is ""Connected""."
1,Completly Sucks (0 Stars),"This is probably one of the worst cds in history.I'd rather listen to betoven than this.I feel contaminated to have ever even touched this cd.Ewwwwww.TOP 5=cant even be five,only good song is the pledge remix.you start to hate memsmerize after you listen to it once."
1,This album sucks!,"Man, all I gotta say is that this album is so horrible. I don't see how any artist can be so lazy...This album is by far the worst rap album I've ever heard. Now I know that girls like Ja Rule because he is girly, so girls may like this album. Guys that love people like Eminem, Dr. Dre, 2 Pac, Biggie, Mobb Deep, Jay-Z, Nas, Canibus, Talib Kweli, Jedi Mind Tricks, Xzbit, Snoop, etc.(aka guys with talent), then you need to stay as far away from this album as you can....I can't even begin to tell you what a disappointment Ja Rule is. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM unless its for your 5 year old sister or niece or something. Thank you, and God bless."
1,Murdaaa? - I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!,"Oh no, Ja Rule wanted to do a real street sound album, but he did a real pop sound album, again! Please, it's the best time to end your career. If you wanna make a great present for christmas for the people, stop your career!"
1,How about no stars???,"Formulaic rehash of his last two albums. No wonder 50 can't stand Ja Rule. Neither can real hip hop fans. Who told Ja he could sing? I heard Ja dissed Eminem on some new track. That was a huge mistake and it might just end his career. Em has consistently showed the hip hop world that no one can dis him and get away with it. How many enemies does Ja want? X don't like him, Jay don't like him, 50 can't stand him, Em will tear him apart lyrically. Bad news for the little guy and his whole crew. Personally I'd like to see a mix tape with nothing but tracks dissing Ja and Murder Inc."
1,I'll give it half a star...,this CD Deserves 1/2 a Star Because i did enjoy whipping it out the window of my car into a nearby bicyclist....It was pretty funny. Otherwise this record was worthless.
1,50 cent and ja rule need to be deported from the planet,Why do you all still support this clown? Ja rule hasn't been hot since his first album. Then he let a clown just as wack as him crush his career. Ja rule is as commercial as they come and his lyrics display that. He is all about the money and not about making good music. This is a very poor release. It is just as wack as dem franchise boys and d4L. Jefferey needs to stop rapping and go rob a bank like steady b.
1,This is garbage!,"Yeah it's me again. I'm giving this 1 star to piss off the stupid Ja fans that think this is good music. I haven't even heard all of it, but I don't need to cos I know he sucks and his career is over. Once again people ain't gonna find this review helpful and once again I DON'T CARE!!! You want good rap music look for Nas, Jigga, 50 or G-Unit!! For this album to be considered Ja's worst it must be really bad because he's never made a good album to begin with. This album makes another good coaster on my coffee table. In all honesty people, just get 2Pac's Greatest Hits instead and Free Yayo!!!"
2,played out,"What i think is that him doing duets is getting kind of boring. i think he should go back to just rapping. i understand it sells more, but I'm tired of him singing.it is getting played out."
2,Ja-Rubbish,Sorry but this album is ... . i really liked the last album 'Pain is love' but this is really terrible i think i like four songs including Mesmerise and Thug Lovin but the others are so tacky and just ... . I think he should either get rid of this and make another and better or just be a feat on other tracks
2,Did You Know Ja Rule Was A Rock Star?,"The problems with most rappers who make it big usually ""sell out"" and go pop. Unless you start off that way you are not being true to you and the end result is this ""The Last Temptation"" CD. Out of 13 songs I liked 6 tracks. Ja Rule ""sings"" too much and completely lost himself. ""Rock Star"" is the worst hip-hop pop track of all time. I was not feeling ""Connected"" or ""The Last Temptation"" with Charli Baltimore either. The only tracks that were okay were:The Pledge F. Nas & Ashanti (MY FAVORITE)Mesmerize F. AshantiThe WarningPop N*gg*sMurder ReignsThug Lovin F. Bobby Brown"
1,boredom inc.,"Here is a puzzle for everybody. Who thinks he is 2pac, but is not nearly as good? Easy Ja Rule! The least talented rapper to have achieved fame. 2pac aside, I don't think he is as good as DMX. Ja is always talking about murda, but when DMX punked him, Ja said nothing back. Some thug huh? Well he's got a song with Ashanti(the colored Britney Spears) called Mesmerize, and a song with Nas. Nas is good, but I don't like the fact that Nas is trying to pretend that Pac was his friend, when Pac dissed him on one of his albums. All in all, Ja could learn a bit from DMX."
1,what happened Ja?,"Ja Rule used to be good back in 99. I don't know what happened to him. He became a sissy after he recorded that song with Vita and Lil Mo. It seems that with every album, Ja is leaning towards a pop media. When he tries to be gangsta, all he can talk about is murder. Why? I would understand if he was still living in the hood, but he is not. Many people are accused of biting Pac-DMX, C-Murder. etc, but at least they remain true to themselves. Ja does not and that is the main reason the album falls flat on its face."
3,there only 1 good tune on it,Yeah yeah just got the album and gotta say its ok.it aint all that to be honest and wont appeal to anyone that is into real hip hop. Thug loving is a good tune ok and its kinda ja rules style but the other tunes on this album r wack except one tune.The tune mesmerize with ashanti has to be the best tune on the album fo sure. It is kinda like the always on time he dun wid ashanti. I would buy the album for this song alone and only for that reason. Nice beat and ashanti's vocals really make dis one of da best songs ive heard in a long long time. its TIGHT!!!!Apart from that it aint all that. but then again it is ja rule. what u expect.
1,no star,"Check this album out if you must but you will be dissapointed, just like all of his other albums this is wack, venni vetti veci was a decent album, rule 3:36 has some good songs but still it was poor and pain is love is a joke and this is worse, infact the whole murder inc crew are wack, ashanti aint that good and irv gotti is just a joke, check him out tryin to look like a gangsta all the time, e.g tha murderas and irv gotti presents the inc covers, wot a sad effort, there aint no way that ja is better than dmx and its a joke that people have the nerve to compare ja to 2pac, pac is a legend and ja fool is a looser, please for your sake dont buy this album, it disgraces the rap game"
1,Resist the Temptation.,"I have no idea what happened. His first CD was damn near perfect. Second CD wasn't bad at all but showed signs of dissipating. Third CD, he barely got by. And now this. I can't even give it a star, but Amazon.com made me. It's way too Pop and then, all of a sudden, he decides he wants to be hard Hip Hop. He should make up his mind.Basically, this album is horrible. Listen before you buy... I did."
1,Can I please give him 0 stars?,"Oh Ja Rule, if only you could go back in time. If you could, hopefully you would have ended your career with Venni Vetti Vecci, your only CD worth listening to. Well, since you can't go back in time, you should just stop digging deeper into this enormous pit you have fallen into and call it quits. When Bobby Brown is more valuable to a rap song then a rapper, you know the ""rapper"" has to be terrible."
1,Pop (Part 3),Ja Rule stinks! I am happy this is his last temptation because he knows that he wasted his talent and his music career! The black Britney Spears of Hip Hop! Thug Lovin' has that same Irv Gotti trademark beat that it makes you sick! Were's the originality! Don't get this! Get The Lost Tapes By Nas instead!
2,This is disapointing,"I have been a fan of Ja since I saw him in the Can I Get A video with Hova, and he established himself as an amazing rapper with Venni Vetti Vecci and The Murderers Compilation, but since then it has been all downhill. At first I didn't mind a few of the ""pop"" songs but when's it gonna end?? His last two cd's were forgettable and this one isn't much better. The one positive on this cd is the track ""Connected"", this song alone is reason to at least listen to the cd once. After I listened to the cd I was very disappointed, If Ja Rule is only releasing one more cd after this he better go back to the style of Venni Vetti Vecci, or it will be a huge waste of talent. Crooked I is amazin!"
2,Has anyone seen Ja Rule?,"Where the hell is Ja Rule? The last time I heard him was back in 2000-2001 when he released 3:36. Ja needs to start back from the beginning, and take a look at what made his first two albums good. I guarentee it wasn't Bobby Brown. Ja Rule needs to stop trying to be an R&B singer and go back to being the rapper that brought us the good stuff like ""Murda for Life"", ""It's Murda"", ""Holla, Holla"". He has made a complete 180 turn from those first two albums, and he needs to go ahead and complete the turn."
1,Ja Rule Sing along Songs,"i think ja should give it up and i hope this is his last attempt to put out more pop garbage packaged as hip-hop. If i want to hear some catchy tunes i have britney,christina,eminem.....and so on to listen to.Cant wait for DMX's new cd....put this pop american idol in his place dog!!!"
2,not worth it,If your in the market for a excellent cup holder though you might want to pick this one up.
1,Garbage,"Ja, what happened? I'll tell you what happened. Ja Rule and Murder Inc felt they discovered the r&b hip hop forumula and he tried to repeat it over and over again and now it just sounds like garbage. When he and Lil Mo & Vita hooked up several albums ago for ""Put It On Me"" it was a nice song. When he and J-Lo hooked up, it was okay, but who is this cat?? Does he think he is Mr. R&B thug? His duet with Ashanti on ""The Last Tempation"" literally hurt my ears. The first single released, ""Thug Lovin"" is okay at best, but if Ja wants to play with the big dawgs, he really needs to come better than this. My advice, pass on this one ..."
1,yadda yadda yadda,"more of the same, thug this, murder that, i'm better than tupac, baby... it's going crazy... the guys digged himself in a rut he can't get out of... even his more ""hardcore"" *cough cough* songs come off as cliches of his fake 'thug' image...i'm a veteran australian rapper with successful underground cd releases and could freestyle circles around ja rules prepared raps...my production is more innovative and original and rarely have guest singers... overall, hes a lyrically inadaquete, D grade MC, whose made millions off of young children who were raised in a time where the lines of ACTUAL hip hop and pop is blurred and are TOLD, through radio station and friends, that this is actually good, being brainwashed to believe this even resembles talent. All hip hop, regardless of style, is supposed to be original, and this lacks inventiveness, style, originality an quality rhymes... a lower than low purchase to those who worship superfisciality...Heads upKaseyAmbientz"
1,Ja Rule is quite possibly the worst rapper ever,"I can't believe we have to put up with rubbish like this pulloting rap. Ja Rule and his buddies Nelly, Chingy etc are killing it! Ja Rule is nothing but a black Justin Timberlake and a Tupac wannabe. He thinks Pac would role with him, that's a laugh. Ja, if Pac was still here you'd be in KFC. And so would your friends. Then people actually believe this guy when he talks about being gangsta and s***. He's fake, people are gonna realize this. Then 50 Cent is a better rapper than you are so stop thinking you can diss him. If your a Ja Rule fan than your a certified retard."
1,This album is THE reason why Ja is no more.,"Every track on this album sucks beyond belief. Especially that ""Mezmerize"" crap where he's singing that ""Your lips, your smile I..."" verse. He should have stuck with the Venni Vetti Vecci period. Too bad he sold out bigtime."
5,MURDAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!,Wow i thought 50 cent was da best.Ja Rule is alot betta but i thought no 1 could beat 50Let me rate those platium beatsIntro- weird but funnyThug Lovin- weird chorus but great rappin by Ja 8\10Memerize- Really cool lyrical love song 10\10pop N*****- okay song but don really listen to it- 6\10Pledge remix- cool song. Nas has good part 8\10Murder reigns- HORRIBLE 0\10Last temptation- Really can get happy. a good song to listen to when ur down 8\10The warning- tight song. really cool lyricsConnected- cool song 8\10Emerica- strange 5\10Rock star- o yeah love dis song 11\10Destiny (outro) pretty tight 9\10The songs r so cleverly wrtten. Ja really takes adventage of his scratchy voice and uses it to make him sound just as tough as he really is. NO1 can use that voice like he can. Better then DMX
2,what losers,"no im not talking about the cd, im talking about all you little kids that make stupid reviews. ""OHH JA RULE IS A SINGER"", and ""KEEP SINGING JA RULE"" and other things like that piss me off. if you didnt like the cd, why didn't you write a review saying so? instead, your demeaning the artist. and why did you even come to the ja rule webpage in the first place, if you didnt like it?enough of that. i say this isnt the best album ja rule has made, but maybe it was just the collaborations, especially with that ex-criminal bobby. that guy pisses me off >.> go buy ""blood in my eyes"" if your a ja rule fan."
1,total crap,"this is the poorest [*] i've ever heard. Ja rule is not a rapper, he's a singer. And even as a singer he's is so weak, his voice is like a unoiled door, or tortured cat screaming, you don't wanna hear this guy's voice at all. Ja, do a favor for all, and end your career."
1,Horrible Hip-Pop cd,This is horrible. Ja Rule is a fake thug. He is a fake Tupac. Murder Inc is horrible. Ja Rule Is horrible. What more can I say??
1,Ja Drool,"Ja Drool is what this guy should be called. You can't understand what he is talking about, which is the case with most rap. Ja Rule..., Rap ....I don't recommned this album, infact I don't recommend any rap albums, namely Ja Rule and Nelly as I can't stand those two guys.If you want to listen to good music go listen to Rock and you'll see that this so called ""rap"" should not even be classified as music"
3,kinda soft Ja...,"yo, sammy again, now i've liked Ja since he came out wit Rule 3:16, i thought dat cd wus kinda hot, but dis 1... a lil different dan regular rap, sorry to say. i like most of da songs, but dey jus so different from wut he used to do. da 1st 2 songs r probly da best 1's on dis one, Thug Lovin' n Mesmerize, n dey rn't really rap, see wut i'm say'n? is like... a hard n deep R&B if u ask me. a #3 4 me would b Rock Star, i guess... da only song das really rap on dis cd is da Pop N****s, but das not all dat great. in all, Ja, i'm still a fan, but i like da old s*** betta, hope ya make dat change..."
4,its murda,well i gave this cd a 4 cuz it a good cd. But isnt his best cd I cant wait for his next cd thats out in 2004.
4,Ja Rule is better and gettin' better!,"I have Ja Rule's latest CD ""The Last Temptation and I think it's a great CD. I am disappointed with his choice of Language, even in ""Pain is Love"" and ""Venti, Vitti, Vicci"". I mean, theres a whole song, ""Pop N****s. I do like his calaborations with Ashanti for ""Mesmerize"". It is a great song and it is a cool mix with her sweet voice and a more deep/rough voice from Ja Rule. The song, ""The Last Temptation"" featured Charli Baltimore, a rising star to come out with an album from Murder, Inc. It is a great album, also featuring: Bobby Brown, Chink Santana, Nas, and even 2Pac. If your a Murder, Inc. fan and haven't picked up the last temptation yet, there is something seriously wrong with you...because the CD rocks!"
3,wow what happened?,"OK first of all this cd is not justice 2 what ja can do, his first 2 were a lot better. I give this cd 3 stars and thats being generious. I only like 2 songs thug lovin' but i hate bobby brown and the pledge remix only cuzz it had nas and pac in it. This cd would b better if ja didn't turn pop he's supposed 2 rap."
4,Good.,"Ok, this might be pop. But I like it. It has some very good singles- ""Thug Loving,"" ""Mesmerize,"" ""The Pledge Remix,"" and the new hot single, ""Murder Reigns"" Pick this CD up if you like Ja or pop. It's good."
3,2Pac wannabe,"The music on this album is good if not excellent. As one reviewer mentioned though, it's more a commercial offering that a true Ja Rule album. The other problem I have with this album is that Ja Rule tries too hard to emulate 2Pac to such a point where it actually clouds his own identity. You can just tell he's a big 2Pac fan from him songs. There is nothing wrong with admiration but wannabeeism is not something a artist of his calibre should sound like!"
1,Weak,Ja Rule has gotten progressively worse with each album. This album is a complete stinker and is disrespectful to hiphop because of its amazing wackness. Murder Inc. is an awful record label and this CD is more proof of that. Like his fellow Murder Inc artist--all this gets is 1 mic..
1,Played out,"Murder Inc fan's (if there any) just face it, your boys are played out. It happen to No Limit in 98, Cash Money in 2000, and ""DA INC"" in 2002,lol1st off you will never get far by ""stealing"" classic hip hop beats, from less than 10 years ago, and just pissing on them with wack lyrics and rappers. All you guys make me and I'm sure real rap fans do is go find the original song ( 2Pac, scarface, lil kim) and play that.2nd, why is Ja such of a ""Pac Jock"". 1st he (urinated) on PAIN, then did it again by sampleing Shed So Many Tears. Man thats wack.I realize they have built their fan base on lil kids who were born in the 80's and who only know about Puffy, Master P, and Eminem. But you will never have the respect of Real Fan's, who would live and die for hip hop"
3,PLEASE let this be the last,"this being his 4th album, i feel a little dissappointed with Ja. He could have been more original but instead he decided to be POP. Until he can be more of the original artist he used tobe, i guess this is all we will receive . A REAL DISSAPPOINTMENT!!"
1,HOPEFULLY THE LAST CD.,"I must warn people to stay away from this garbage known as the last temptation.Ja rule is the justin timberlake of hip hop and he is simply a joke to everyone.All the songs on this cd are mediocre at best and he steals other peoples styles.I dont know which is worst,his movie with segal or this cd?DO NOT SUPPORT THIS CLOWN!!!"
1,THE WORST EXCUSE FOR A RAPPER EVER I HOPE 50 CENT SMOKES HIM,he aint a rapper hes a singer he sings more than beyonce. He does these duets with females and he sings more than they do. then he has the nerve to call himself a gangsta. What a hypocriticial wanksta talentless peice of crap! i hope 50 cent blows him off the map!
2,Talk about Pop Music,"Boy is Ja Rule fun and exciting. I have all kinds of Ja Rule posters on my wall, right next to my Britney, Justin Timberlake, and ofcourse O-Town posters. Ja Rule's the favorite of all my friends, we listen to him on the way to pee-wee football to get all pumped up... I love how he sings, and mixes his songs with female singers...in fact sometimes it's hard to tell who is the female sometimes, he sounds like this girl in my class when he sings....Ja Rule please don't stop singing. Don't listen to 50 cent, he's a rapper, you're a singer, why would he diss you ? The 5th grade class at Washington loves your singing Ja Rule !!!"
1,This was weak!,When I heard about JaRule's new CD i went and spent $ on the CD I thought would be good but it really was weak ... I only listened to Pledge remix and Thug Loving!Ja needs to go back to his days as thugged out and leave the pop rap to Nelly.
1,2Pac Clone&Comedian,"Ja Rule while His Gost writing may have made Him some Paper His actual Talent has never been on the mic too me.He cracks me up.I'm amazed that His VOice transcends with the Masses so well.I want whatever folks are drinking? I Cringe Hearing Him Rapping&Singing??Oh My GOD!!with His Flow&Rapping I Need a Air-Bag too control the Laughter.He has been getting over a Wanna-be 2Pac type of thing far too long.while I liked Bobby Brown back in the day bringing Bobby Back wasn't the right thing for a debut song off a New Album.I've always thought Ja Rule was Wack&Nothing has changed.Ashanti? no comment on that voice or Charli Baltimore.""Murder INC"".. is sinking&thank goodness."
1,Ja Rule should call it quits,"JA Rule is so wack that its not even funny. The kid started off nicely with venni,vetti,vechi which was a superb album. Then he just changed to this r&b bs and now hes wack as hell. Rule 3:36 was kinda hot, but that love s**t should of stopped there. Now he comes out with the last temptation which to me is the worst album of 2002. F**king smilez and southstar is better than that bs. I would of given this album negative fifty stars. Ja rule should just leave the game before he gets forced out of the game. If you got money to buy cds I suggest you buy god's son, swiss beats presents ghetto stories, the blueprint 2, dutty rock, 8 mile soundtrack, under construction, even old school sugar hill gang would be better. Ja rule is a f**king joke, lol. Maybe if he goes back to the old formula then maybe he got something. Im out 1"
1,Like the crowd says......,"Ja Rule is nobody in the rap game. I am so glad I burned this album. There are only three songs that I like, but otherwise it's just garbage, again. The Pledge is a hot track because Nas saved it. Thug Luvin' I like dispite it being commercial, but hey I have to throw him a bone. The Warning is pretty good because it is the only song that reminds me of Venni Vetti Vecci, the only good Ja Rule album. I really hope his last album is respectable, because so far this man is just another example of artist selling their souls for the mighty green dollar."
1,disapointing,"Let's hope this is Ja Rule last album. This is the worst ""rap"" album i've heard this year!"
3,Last Temptation decent at best.,"The latest effort from Murder Inc.'s top dog is decent at best. Only three songs stick out in my mind. ""Thug Luvin"", the first single featuring Bobby Brown is a very good tune along with the second single ""Mesermerize"" with Ashanti. The only other good song is the title track featuring Charli Baltimore. The whole album seems to be full of filler tracks, with no real hits. Ja Rule should probably bounce back relatively quick ......"
4,Why all the bad reviews?,"This might not be the same Ja you're used to, but this is still a good cd. There is so much variety in every song that you can't get bored with it or say that all his albums sound the same. I say check it out and decide for yourself, because I was pleased with what I heard."
2,nope......is this rap??,"what happened to the old ja rule is what I wanna know....now he is basically the britney spears of rap. How can you be hardcore when you do duets with Ashanti and then talk bout how his labels the realist murderas out there....doesn't make sense. Looks like 50 cent's gotta be the one to tell ja rule that he is one wack, fake, commercial rapper. He doesn't clam that he trys to be like 2pac, but come on now...what other rapper uses pac's material for every other song they make. Where would ja be if pac was alive?? Probably sitten at home makin music with Ashanti like sonny and cher.."
2,The Last Attempt-tation,".. I expected this album to be really good (due to all the hype I heard about it),but in truth it's not. Thankfully I borrowed this album off a friend instead of buying it first. Ja Rule needs to give up the mic once and for all. He and his sidekick Ashanti have now way over-played the whole ""murder inc"" thing..."
1,GARBAGE,"Typical Ja Rule Album: it stinks! He is a singer, not a rapper for one thing. For another, hes a horrible singer anyways. Enough said."
1,Garbage,"This is one of the worst albums i've ever heard. What is up with artists these days. Do they not listen to what they put out. Ja Rule has totally lost his rap roots. When he sings, he sounds like a frog in labor. Ja Rule do us a favor; stop acting like Pac, stop singing, and keep this your last album like you said. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on your garbage. DON'T BUY THIS CD!"
1,this is the worst ever!!,"Man this guy just isn't quiting is he? This album is the worst in the entire world and ever made!!! Ja Rule should've stayed with that veni vetti flow instead of going commercial with this [stuff]! I think Jay-Z did a better job then Ja. People think we are hatin' or blah blah, but the fact of the matter is that this supposively ""rap artist"" isn't rapping anymore. He's music isn't the same and ain't rap or hip-hop, its POP! ..."
2,a disappointing record,"in 3:36 ja managed a to walk a fine line-he had some pop songs that were able to be played on the radio for all the pop fans, and then he had some real stuff for the rap fans. pain is love was a little more pop, but still had enough songs for the rap fan. unfortunately, i'm not sure what ja was thinking on the last temptation. aside from mesmerize, which is a great track(even though it is a lot of pop), there is not much to listen to on the album."
1,whats this...smells like fish,"Ok, Ja Rule gets 1 star for being able to make so much money off such wack shiyt. Thats worth one star. The album is softer than a Hush Puppy yet Ja portrays himself as a SUPER OG x3 SUPER THUG! I would NOT recommend this CD to anyone, unless you consider Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake ""hip hop"". However, I must take my hat off to Ja Rule for making so much scrilla and having no musical talent whatsoever. Smart dude. I have no rapping skills either, maybe I can put out my ""First Temptation"" album and scream MURDA MURDA all over the tracks and sell millions! Let me get this right, Ja Rule wants ME to spend MY money, so I can listen to this garbage and make HIM rich. No way pal, I'd rather give my 15 bucks to the Salvation Army this holiday season. HOLLA HOLLA!"
1,weak,This new Ja Rule album is awful. He gets progressively worse with each effort-somebody PLEASE stop the madness.
1,THIS is not hip hop,It is pop. Ja Rule is an embarassment to all MCs and should introduce his peanut head to a bullet. and please stop the tupac comparisons - ja doesn't have half the talent tupac did
1,What happened to this guy?,"He copies the image of 2Pac with the voice of of DMX so right there he has no originality but at least his first album was good. He's gotten worse with each album afterwards. Doing all these songs with female R&B singers are bailing him out with the top 40 mainstream public but pure rap fans have lost all faith in him whatsoever after ...album. Now it seems that 50 Cent's dissing of Ja Rule is justified, ... even during the halftime show of the Eagles vs Bucs game the fans in Philly all booed him off the field. He was that bad, the guy can't sing so I don't know who he is trying to fool and now he can't rap either. If you want to hear some real rap from the streets listen to Nas' last two albums (Stillmatic & God's Son). I also recommend Phrenology from The Roots. Don't waste your time with this, usually when you see the majority of people reviewing this album give it 1 star it's for a good reason."
1,My real rating would be a negative 5,"Let's just do everyone a favor and clear something up. Ja Rule is not rap. Ja Rule is pure pop... Period. It's so disappointing that someone who had the ability (see his first album) to be at least an above average mc turn to this drivel. One day, this little guy is going to look back on his career and want to kill himself. He's a mockery to hip hop and is exactly what's wrong with music today."
1,IF U BOUGHT THIS CD I FEEL 4 YOU,"this is the worst cd ever. oohh my god words cannot express how bad this is. u just dont know, thank god my friend made me a copy of this and i didn't buy this worth less piece of s**t. this guy went from hip hop to pop. he is so pop that i think justin timberlake has more thug in his pnky finger. than jarule in his whole body."
1,yo,"everyone do not hate on ja rule because 50 cent hates him. your all just a bunch of followers and mainstreamers if you do. hate him for the poppy crap that he puts out. incase you didnt know 50 cent has became ja rule with whack poppy crap. listen to smile, pimp, 21 questions, baby u got. all trash. boycott those music."
3,and that's only because i like the first album...,i like Ja and all and i don't care what other people say about him...but this particular album is a disapointment to all ja rule fan's....compared to his last album which i would def. rate as a 5 this one is a 3...out of all the songs on this cd i would only see one ..maybe two at the most as being halfway decent...he has gone down hill...def. a disapointment.
1,is da func doc serious?,"Ja rule is not a sellout? His first record was by far his best and he's still not on par with any of the top rappers, Nas, Jay Z, Redman, etc. And for you to call the blueprint 2 a classic already is just rediculous as well, let alone compare Ja Rule to Jay Z. It doesn't suprise me that this guy gave nelly and fabolous 5 stars. compare 50 cent to fabolous, see who u like better. nelly sold the f##k out too, doing a song with Justin Timberlake. Anyone who listened to this assclown and bought this album, im sorry for u, try and get your money back."
3,Disappointment,"This album is a true disappiontment. I wasn't expecting a 5x Platinum record, but I can't see this on going 2x. Lack of tracks and lack of hits make this a 3 in my book."
1,what happened,"what happened with this album? Venni Vetti Vecci, Rule 3:36 and pain is love were all terrific. This album has nothing but little girls singing and him professing his love for Murder Inc. and Irv Gotti. there is a song that says it features 2Pac and all it has of 'pac is him saying as ""I walk through the valley of the shadow of death"" this album umtimately sucks, don't waste your money"
3,It's Not That Bad,JAAAAAa. Thats what B.Brown screams in Thug Luvin. Look Ja Rule is the man and he never has had a real geart album just hit singles. This albums has way too many samples and some of the songs are kind of dumb. But the Big Remo skits after the tracks have always been funny and we got Bobby Brown. You will be listning to tracks 2 and 5 over and over.
1,if i could give ja a zero i would....,"ja is wack. he has not style, and not potential as an artist.his music is nothing spectacular and his voice is so annoying. put some base in your voice ja. i think it's about he gave up on this rapping career thing, because like he says its murdah...as in you're killing us, and its not worth purchasing anything by murdah inc. and all them. and ja is just played out, go take care of your kids and stay home with the wife. leave this to the real rappers and get out while you can."
2,Ja Rule is falling off...,I remember when Ja Rule first came on the scene during the Hardknock Life era with Jay-Z and DMX. Ja was like an energizer bunny for hip hop. His lyrics were flames and his production on his debut album was lovely. Four years and millions of records later....Ja rule is garbage..you can tell that his commercial success has killed his hunger..Bobby Brown on a track? That was the funniest video that has been on BET in years..This CD has too many filler tracks jacked from popular R&B groups...Basically..this album is better left in the record stores...
4,New Album Review,"The New Album Of Ja's Isnt tha best one he has ever made but it is one of tha better ones it has some god duo's on it,but him and ashanti have done enough dou's together and they need to start doing there own music. The Are Great singers together but its gettin a little old. Thug Lovin is one of the best tracks on his new album. Him and Bobby Brown did a great job of recordin it and making a pretty PHAT video of that single.There are some pretty bad tracks but only about two of them i think You will find out yourself when u hear the album. On the brighter side of this album it is a great album. I think that he ais a great rapper and he needs to stick with rappin instead of bein an actor. He is better than DMX but he has his days. Thats All for now talk to ya on my next review!"
5,A simply fascinating biographical study,"Anna Wickham: A Poet's Daring Life by Jennifer Vaughan Jones (Viterbo University) is an informed and informative biography of the trailblazing female poet Anna Wickham (1883-1947). When Anna's husband felt threatened by her poetry, he had her committed against her will to a mental hospital. Yet it was within those restrictive and alien confines that Anna was stimulated to write eighty moving poems, and find the strength to flourish as a literary creator. Anna eventually separated from her husband and found an (unfortunately unrequited) love for Natalie Clifford Barney, a lesbian American millionaire. Anna Wickham: A Poet's Daring Life is a simply fascinating biographical study and presentation enhanced with exclusive interviews with members of Anna Wickham's family and a newly discovered written correspondence."
5,Step Stool,We love this item. It is perfect for our 13 month old to climb onto and wash his hands. It is sturdy and safe.
2,"15.99?!--Get Over Yourself, Baby Bjorn!","It's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached. Effectively serves its purpose, but for nearly 16 bucks?!! Puleeeeeeeease!"
5,IS THERE A BETTER SIGN????????????,"I have a AMAZON bud who is not only a fantastic friendbut is smart caring and kind.She is very insightful whenit comes to Movies,cycles and music. If you have thetime look her up on the people section of AMAZON and see herlong list of reviews.You will find she is not only smart,butquite funny too...Thinks Geri for being you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great as a supplement,"If you are using this product to supplement a more comprehensive Spanish language learning program with your child or for something productive to fill up wasted travel time in the car, then I think that this is a great product. The CD features a story with an American boy and a Spanish-speaking girl. The boy and girl are on the way to a party with some Spanish speakers and the girl teaches the boy some vocabulary that he will be using at the party. The CD comes with a fun wipe-off book and dry erase marker. Some of the activities in the workbook are better than others."
2,blah,"The kids did not like this product. It did not make learning a new language fun at all, in fact they found it to be confusing. Save your money and don't bother with this product. My kids are 12 and under."
3,Tasty Tarot....,"The perfect gift for any Kitchen Witch! This is a fully functioning tarot deck with recipes that somehow relate to the card being represented. The deck is oversized so the cards are rather large.I only rated this deck three stars for what one of the other reviewers touched on......the recipes. (Not the most creative or scrumptious dishes to come across your palate!) The size was also important to me....I tend to dislike oversized cards as I find them difficult to divine with, but they are the perfect size for recipes......I guess you can't have it all!Overall, still a great gift and I recommend it."
3,Taken Care Of!!!,"Battery was a dud. The Retailer took care of me and gave me a refund. That is why I shop thru Amazon.com.Thanks, Sam"
2,Dissapointed,"Just received this book. He has nothing to say about Nikon bodies & equiptment. His formulas for magnification rates are dead wrong. Very outdated info. on Digital. Who cares or has the money to do microphotography. Uses very expensive equiptment that the average photographer cannot afford. We don't have access to National Geographics photography equipment. Very wordy and nonsensical information that you can get from any general photography book.The quality of the photos and paper is very nice. But, John Shaws Closeups has much more and accurate information for the average photographer. There is also a new book that I just ordered that was just published and reccomended by Shutterbug for just $16. This book is being returned to Amazon.Save your money. If you want some great pictures (which this book has) go to previous Natl. Geographic issuesDon't wate your money!!"
2,Great coffee table book,"The book is beautifully produced and the photos are stunning. However, the text is hopeless in being not specific enough and way too long at the same time. Readers who prefer a much higher information-density should consider John Shaw's Closeups in Nature (1987, you'll need to skip the sections on using film but otherwise entirely on point) or John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide (which tells you as much as this book, but does it in about 15 pages)."
2,"Stunning Photos, But Jumbled Text","The photos in this book are superb. In macro photography I'm really attentive to backgrounds, and Loaec has mastered the very difficult task creating colorful exciting backgrounds on high magnification images. The author demonstrates his highly evovled skills time and again with an abundance of awe inspiring photographs.My disappointment with the book is with the text. Maybe there's something lost in translation, but I find the writing rather stilted, and the information content was sparce. There was very little discussion that helped me understand how he produced his very fine images.I did note that in many cases he used comparatively low magnifications, and then cropped and enlarged to create his images. This would not be evident, though, to those who are not practiced macro photographers."
2,Stop aging or slow the process,"Some useful information, but nothing you can't get for free on the internet. Book is only 45 pages long and doesn't justify price. I've read a lot of articles by this author, and usually respect his writings and opinions, but am very disappointed in this case."
1,Are They Kidding?,"I bought this DVD only to discover it is a bootleg (?) version of another DVD with the same title. The distributor went out of business several years ago and the quality looks like it was copied from another DVD. Charging over $25 for this adds insult to injury. If you want to buy this, look for the same title on a white background with different graphics - also for sale on Amazon but at 1/5 cost! Unless of course you want to give a nice Christmas present to whomever is trying to sell it!"
4,A great reissue,A great reissue ! My dad owned both of these albums so I remember hearing them alot. For me the standout disc is Burning Memories . Gorgeous early sixties Nashville sound ! Touch My Heart ( Ray's last straight country album before the career changing Danny Boy ) is more stripped down and a little repetitive but still classy stuff.
3,different from LP's,"I thought that this CD was made from the origanal LP's and it isn't.The songs are the same but are remakes,hence the instrumentals are different and the tempo is a little slow compared to the origanal."
4,Sexy girls and great locales,"Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Jamaica are featured in this video, but the natural wonders provided by Playboy manage to outshine Mother Nature. The first segment, in Puerto Rico, is the best. Petra Verkaik--she of the most stupendous breasts of all time--is featured prominently in that first segment. Lots to look at in this one."
3,Good first half,This video starts of very well with scenes in Puerto Rico and Hawaii featuring a group of very sexy Playmates such as Ava Fabian and Tawnie Cable.The scenes in Puerto Rico are particularly sexy especially the skinny dipping sequence and the backstage at the bikini show. The comments by the Puerto Rican girl about the difference about what Anglos and Latinos like about a girl's body is very funny. The video falls apart in the Jamaica sequences where it becomes a boring Travel Channel-like travelogue and also becomes a virtual ad for Playboy TV's boring Eden series. It's amazingly boring. I would buy the DVD version of this since you can skip the Jamaican bits.
1,Dated,"I wasn't impressed with this title. The main reason I bought it was to see the Julie Clarke sequences but sadly they weren't to good. All the sequences tended to be nornal holiday activities - but nude. Horse riding, swimming etc. Not very erotic I'm afraid."
3,Good pen performance,"I really like these pens for use with the work I perform, they consistentl mark well. The only shortcoming is that the barrel end where the ball retracts breaks after 40 to 60 percent usage."
5,Pilot EasyTouch Ballpoint pens,Best pens ever. The pens are easy to write with and the ink flows very smoothly. I keep a supply on hand.
5,Great Pen,"The best cheap pen I have ever owned. The ink is crisp like a gel ink, but it writes very smooth without the blobs of gel ink. I have bought the black and the blue, medium point, and am fully satisfied. I don't have any experience with the fine point."
4,"Work well, well worth the price","These are your typical pens, work well, have a nice ink flow. Not going to win any writing contests, but can certainly compete well in a contest of value."
5,Wonderful Short Stories - Rewarding Read,"I have owned a paperback version of this book since the mid 1990s! It was a last minute choice at Heathrow minutes before flying back to America. I break it out once every so often and enjoy every time! Some of the stories are translated from the original Welsh language while others are in English. Either way, the stories are epic; the prose, brilliant. Highly recommend. (Please note, my use of the word ""epic"" leans towards hyperbole!Favorites include: ""Canute"" by Rhy Davies; ""The Dress"" by Dylan Thomas; and ""Song of a Pole"" by Islwyn Ffowc Elis.And please, check out my music here on Amazon!Someone I'll Never Meet"
5,Wonderful Music,"I listen to this CD at least once a day. It is great to put on the headphones and just relax. Also, it is great to have playing when studying and reading."
3,It's okay...,"Great things don't last long I suppose.After a while, the knee pads don't hold up anymore. When I get sweaty (really sweaty), my knee pads would slide off when diving for a ball--just recently got myself a nice colorful bruise from the gym floor.I do wash my knee pads often, but thru time it can only take so much before it starts to stink and you can't do anything about it. I've been told to get two knee pads and alternate them as well as other remedies.I like how compact these are, unlike the other brands that bulge--like you have a disfigured knee. (Besides, that's so 80's!)Probably not going to purchase another Mizuno, but will try other brands until I find the best one for me: aesthetics, comfort, and durability."
4,"Perfect fit, protects well","I bought these kneepads to replace my pair of Under Armour kneepads, b/c the UA were just too tight and restrictive (even though they were a size large). I am 6'-4"", and could not find any slim-looking pads in an appropriate size to fit (my knee is 17.5"").I bought this pair in a large b/c I found the measurements on another website, and these fit really well. They are just a bit longer than the UA pair, so they cover more of my leg, and they are not too tight around my knee. Overall, a great fit.They also provide nice impact protection all around the knee, without being too bulky. I need to pull them up every now and then while on the court, but I think that comes with any knee pad. They seem to be holding up fairly well, though I have not washed them yet."
3,Mizuno Kneepads,We bought these on the suggestion of my daughter's volleyball coach and they were less expensive then the kneepads I usually buy. They were too long and uncomfortable and did not allow my daughter to move around like she usually does. I guess she is just used to the smaller shorter profile kneepads.
4,Work good but tight,"These seem to protect my knees well. I ordered medium thinking, from other reviews, that they might fit my husband but they are very tight on me. I'm not big and I'm on the thin side. Perhaps they will stretch out with use and washing."
4,great value,My daughter love them! They are sturdy and well built. Last year we bought the white-ones but they get dirty to easy and they are hard to keep them clean. This ones (black) look pretty good after you wash them and after a hard day at practice. Get them!
3,Mizuno Kneepad,"I purchased these knee pads for our cast of baseball players to use in our production of ""Damn Yankees"". The guys wore through them in the rehearsal process, before opening night. We had to purchase more for the run of the show. Maybe our use was more severe than volleyball, but for the price, I expected them to be sturdier."
3,"wonderful pictures, binding interferes with spreads","On October 30, 1999, I happened to go into the Rizzoli Bookstore in San Francisco and learned there was an exhibit of photographs from this book. The photographs are wonderful.But as for the book (hardbound), the binding interferes with the enjoyment of the photos. Many of the photos are two-page spreads with the photo crossing the gutter. I could not open the book flat enough to see what was in the gutter.While this book has sewn signatures, they seem to have been glued onto a hard strip that limits flexibility. BOOKS DO NOT HAVE TO BE BOUND LIKE THIS!!!"
1,HK = Hums Konstantly,"I purchased my HK AVR45 in July. It sounded great except for the hum. Went through all of their suggestions, it was in the shop for almost two months waiting for parts. But the parts did no good. I worked with HK customer relations people and they were great. They are replacing my unit with the brand new AVR500 model. Hopefully it will not hum. If you are having trouble with your unit contact them by phone or e-mail."
4,err,Ate it as a kid in france now eat less but uses it in a cafe shop as a tip for the kids working there since they are not allowed to accept $$$
4,Beautiful but broken!!!!,"I ordered the Danze Parma chrome trim kit. This thing is amazing and super nice but the shower head was broken. Packed very poorly, but amazon said they would send a replacement next day shipment. well the next day has come and gone. Still no replacement. Customer serviced had no tracking or carrier info for me and I just have to wait. I will be returning it. Had to buy one at the store so the remodeling of my bathroom can continue."
4,Standard Catalog of World Crowns and Talers : From 1601-Date,I think this catalog is not updated. I would like a best one. I'm sure they are working on it...
5,A perfect way to start leaning about Detoxing.....very easy!,Excellent packaging and easy to use.... If you ever wanted to understand the excellence of detoxing...this is for you! It makes it very simple and fun!!!
5,Good and very useful book,"I am glad I spent the money and time on this book. It really opened up my eyes to a lot of things I never really thought about. I am now more conscious of what I do with my body. I have been recommending this book to all my friends around. Most of us really don't understand what we need to do to be healthy, or we think we are doing the right things while we aren't. This book really helps you to become as healthy as you can be. Are there more thorough detoxifications available? Probably, but few of us have the luxury of following them. The only other book that I can recommend with Detox Box is ""Can We Live 150"" with many cleansing recipes for the entire body. Check also Cure the Incurable"
1,No video on the Yoga CD's,"This box is totally unnecessary if you have purchased the Ultra Simple Diet book. The audio on the CD's works just fine, but there is not video so it's hard to follow the yoga sequences. I tried it on the DVD just in case the disk was a DVD but to no avail. The box was a total waste of money. The Ultra Simple Diet book, on the other hand, was excellent. I tried to contact the Sounds True company who were responsible for the CD's, but they did not reply to my emai so I am out the cost of the box!"
1,Detox my Brain,"I would have wanted more details of the content. I was disappointed with the package contents. Difficult to explain. I returned for credit, thought it was a slow process."
2,detox,This Detox program would be difficult to follow for someone with a job and demands on their time. It is not a simple plan.
2,buy this only after really committing....,This product was very interesting and informative. Difficult to follow detox rules are made much easier with this product that breaks down each stage and day into an easy to follow cue card format. A lot of info is consisely written into a cue card format.
5,valid and reliable Doc,I have not used the product as of yet. I have purchased all of the materials and plan to do the cleans when I am in more stable health. The products suggested are all of high quality and the instructions extremely clear and concise. Background biographical data on the designing M.D. is informative and you can get more information on him at [...] The cleans utilizes many age old remedies and treatments to cleans the body and no far-out untested approaches. The opportunity to do short treatments and long-terms applications of the cleans protocol are delineated in the informational packet. Excellent product from a reliable and valid source.
4,Review,"As of this writing, I have received and looked over the Detox Box materials, but have not implemented them as yet. I am reading Dr. Hyman's book UltraMetablolism as a foundation for the use of this Detox Box.So far, I think the materials appear to be soundly based. I think it will represent a committment to change and health that is needed in my case. A couple of my friends are pursuing similar changes in their lives and the ones ahead of me seem to be doing well and are reporting good results. I'm looking forward to giving this a try."
4,Serious Detox,"This detox program is very complete. It recommends sources for all support supplements, the yoga CD is great. I found it very time consuming to follow the detox meal prep. I lost almost 5 pounds of fat in a week. After the week I started feeling bad and slowly resumed eating more healthy foods. I probably had tired of drinking the broth and other support nutrients. It changed how I view food and my body. Definately worth the effort, just plan on serious dedication for at least a week."
4,gift,"Bought this as a gift - kind of an 'Us' gift since it's such a classic! Have not watched this DVD yet. It has been added to our collection. The only thing is it's not a 'hard' case on the outside. It's made of paper so I consider it to be flimsy. Otherwise, not that big a deal."
3,"ok movie, but bad morals","I looked forward to watching this movie, but I unfortunately found out in the first few minutes that this movie revolves around sex. Although there are some great dancers, the dance moves have a sexual connotation. I would not show this movie to your kids."
1,Not even close to factory spec,"I purchased these for my 2001 Subaru Outback. According to Amazon, these should have fit, but they weren't even close. It took significant effort to get the narrow end over the tie rod shaft, and the wide end was about half an inch smaller in diameter than the original Subaru boot. There was absolutely no way to stretch it over the flange on the steering rack."
5,Fibromyalgia: A Journey Toward Healing,"A truly excellent book. This book talks about what fibromyalgia is and how it works in great medical detail, as well as how to manage it using natural therapies such as herbalism and massage.Has a section crammed with information on the treatment of fibromyalgia using natural herbal medicines. This really is a must have book for those of us with FMS."
3,Alpha 40 ARF Trainer,"The Alpha .40 ARF Trainer is a good beginning RC airplane. It is covered with Ultra Cote, a quality covering material that can be found in most hobby shops, if and when repairs are needed. I would recommend reinforcing the firewall with tri-stock. I wish that the tail surfaces were constructed from build-up balsa rather than solid balsa...it makes the tail very heavy, requiring extra weight up front. The stabilizer was also warped and, after trying multiple times to straighten it, finally gave up. The airplane is attractive and well designed."
4,Dosh is just getting warmed up,"Outside of his casual day job as the drummer for Andrew Broder's Fog, Martin Dosh has a quaint little hobby going as a basement producer. Though critically acclaimed, his first two albums sounded like/as they were recorded in a basement. For whatever reason, Dosh decided to open up the studio for his third album. The Lost Take sees contributions from Andrew Bird's violin, the guitars of Erik Applewick (Tapes n' Tapes) and Jeremy Ylvisaker (Fog), Happy Apple's Mike Lewis, and more, while the production sounds more expensive. The focus here is not on glitchy drum and bass like Pure Trash nor on field recording driven downtempo like his self-titled solo debut. While his song structure is still quite manic, the richness of sounds and collaborations makes this Take his most fully realized album yet. Screw day jobs. Fog has gone downhill with every album, but Dosh is just getting warmed up."
3,Normal book,I have visited a lot of the countries which have monuments described in this book. I would say that this is normal book for such price. But if someone is interested in one of the cultural centres more deeply I recommend to find something else.
1,Have Not Received!!,"It has been nearly a month now, and I have yet to receive the caraf. You do not want to experience someone with coffee deprivation. My co-workers are brewing daily to keep me civil!Amazon would do well to sever their relationship with this company, in the interest of customer relations!Marian Stillwell"
2,coffee pot,This was not the right size coffee pot although it said it would work for my black@decker coffee maker.Also had to pay return shipping. Don't think I will be shopping Amazon again.
3,"Works, But Not Well","I give it 3 stars because I guess it does what it's supposed to do. However, I have a DE755 coffee maker (which this is supposed to work as a replacement for), and the carafe doesn't fit correctly on the heating plate. The rounded bottom is too large to fit inside the heating plate portion of the coffee maker, so the carafe is slightly unstable and doesn't get full contact for even heating.I guess I'm happy the coffee maker functions again, which is why I didn't drop my rating to 2 stars."
3,carafe,I broke the carafe and neededa a replacement. the coffee maker was still good and it seemed that throwing the maker away was wastefull.
4,Nice fit,The Motorola RAZR V3 Plastic Shell Casing is a nice fit for my red RAZR. I wanted the clear one so the red would show and it looks very nice. I also like the fact that it protects me from inadvertently pushing the soft keys on the side (happened a lot prior to getting the case).Nice product!
2,so-so,This case started out good but then began to collect a lot of dirt under it. the case is quite thin as well and one of the clips that hold it to the phone broke off. it's also easier to put on than to take off. it can scratch the phone as well not to mention getting scratches itself. not the best add on.
1,Did not fit well my motorola V3xx,I do not use this as it just did not fit my phone. Threw it right away.
1,Didn't fit correctly,"This product didn't fit the Razor Phone that I purchased it for. The cut outs didn't align and I couldn't charge the phone when the plastic cover was on it. The cost wasn't too high, so it was worth the chance, but it didn't work out. I ended up purchasing a quality cover from the AT&T Store for $30.00 but it's a lot nicer and everything works on it."
1,You get what you pay for,"I can't really complain, because I believe that this was a case of you get what you pay for. This phone case broke as I was installing it onto the phone."
1,"not new, empty and ... just bad",what you see in the picture is not what you get. I bought what i thought would be a new epson cartridge in box. instead i get a used epson cartridge in a bag... ok well packaging is not everything i can deal with a manufactured cartridge no biggie there was planning to dock one star fr this... then i put it in the printer and it out of the box registers as low on ink. then when I figure it must be a re-manufacturing thing and i will just hope it lasts... well it got 2 of 5 pages of TEXT... text mind you a 12 point courier new on 8 1/2 x 11 paper and it fails. i bought a re-manufactured LD cartridge for half the p[rice that also had amazon prime shipping at the same time to compare it to and seeing as the re-manufactured one has already printed 20 pages it has proven at least 10 times better than this one and it registers as full on ink from the start/still does now these are supposed to last about 300 pages of text not 2... do not buy this product!
1,What is 2 pack?,I order 2 items for HWF23 (2-Pack) filter. I got only 2 quantity which is hight lights. So 2 order for HWF23 turned out to be only 2 quantities. So the half-price sale is the same for one item HWF23 (2-Pack). They need to correct the title HWF23 .... (1-Pack) filter ...
5,Prince of Tides,"Pat Conroy delivers an outstanding book! The descriptions, the places, the people are visible through his words. I look forward to more books in the near future.I am shocked I have not read this book before now."
3,"Starts off interesting, but then trails off","When I began this book I was excited, because everyone either loved Prince or Pat Conroy. The words threw me, but I continued on because i wanted to see if it was as great as everybody said it was. It wasn't. The words got worse, and I lost interest after a couple hundred pages. He would state a supposed reason for why the family was so mixed up, not adress it for a 100 pages, and i still didn't understand. I would rather read a 300 page book that could've said the same thing without all the comments about how wonderfull/horrible the south is."
5,I adore all of Pat Conroy's writings!,"I;ve read nearly all of Pat Conroy's books. Love the South, love his detail to whats important, love his characters."
2,"In my opinion, The Prince of Tides drowned. I did not care for this book.",I could not get into this book and decided not to read it. Thank you for the opportunity to try it.
4,intersting perception,"The book I read was one of those books that draws you in, and when you wake up in the morning to feel as if you are a character, living out the plot of the story. Prince of tides is the one book that you just can't possibly put down even to eat. You read walk. I could not put this book down even to tie my shoe. I would of rather tripped and fallen then to have miss a part of this book. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone..who wants to feel the adventure of a life that is exstrmly twisted and yet so familiar."
3,The ending isn't...,"Conroy's writing is, as always, spectacular inThe Prince of Tides: A Novel.The protagonist is not your usual hero, again a Conroy trait. The history and cause of the difficulties faced by the protagonist are intense and with occasional humor - another Conroy trait.The reason I gave this one 3 stars instead of 4 is that I didn't care for the ending. I felt it left too much unresolved - this is NOT a common Conroy trait. If I went further into detail, it would require spoilers.I recommend the book because the story, regardless of the ending, is such a good one and the writing is first rate."
4,read and walk,"The book I read was one of those books that draws you in, and when you wake up in the morning to feel as if you are a character, living out the plot of the story. Prince of tides is the one book that you just can't possibly put down even to eat. You read walk. I could not put this book down even to tie my shoe. I would of rather tripped and fallen then to miss apart of this book. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, who wants to feel the adventure of a life soo twisted and yet so fimailiar. I usually don't enjoy long lengthy books.. actually just books in gernral. At 14 this book for me was a little thick but i got through it well."
5,Quite simply the best novel I have ever read,"I begin with a plea: For those of you unlucky enough to see the abysmal, horrid film with the same name, rest assured that the film and the novel only remotely have even the same plot. Thank God, too, that Streishand had nothing to do with the writing of this most wonderful book. This is a relief to humanity.The novel is primarily about the sometimes rocky coming of age -- in the lush Carolina lowlands -- of the three children (unlike the film, it is only peripherally about the romance between Tom and Lowenstein). Most immediately, it is absolutely exquisitely written. Conroy's language and dialogue are as pleaasureable and stimulating to read as any other I've ever encountered.The book will literally have tears of laughter running down your face, especially in the earlier chapters when Tom interacts with his own children. By the end your soul will have been profoundly stirred and your life literally, inexorably changed.Read this book."
1,Surprisingly Not Good,"I really did not enjoy this book. Having thoroughly researched it on several sites, I decided to purchase it and thought it would be a good read. Being an avid reader, I thought, piece of cake - a good, but thorough read. But I couldn't get through it. It was dark, brooding and left me unsatisfied the entire time I tried reading it. I finally took it off my Kindle and decided I won't be coming back to it."
2,"gripping, but not great literature.","Prince of Tides would have been a much better read if it didn't show its age so badly. Conroy's fixation on politically correct themes (the white southern boy constantly emphasizing that he's unfairly labeled a racist) and the classic disfunctional family model (abusive father, enabling mother) easily allow you to place the publication date smack dab in the middle of the eighties. If these two themes hadn't been hammered at constantly throughout the book, it might make it more enjoyable to read 10 years after it was published.The dialogue also needs some work. Tom Wingo is simply too clever in the biting exchanges with his mother or the witty sarcasm which so successfully woos the icy therapist. I found myself cringing at some of the contrived interaction in this book."
5,Amazing,"This book was gorgeously written. The language was captivating and almost poetic. I couldn't put it down. The story was hilarious to gut-wretching, and everything in between. Characters so three dimentionally written, one would believe they were real-life acquaintances. One of the most moving books I've ever read."
1,Prince of Tides,"very depressing. I tried to read the whole book, but by time I was half way through, I gave up."
2,Tremendous amount of fat,"There's a load of fat in this melodrama novel. It could have been edited in half, at least. The story is excruciatingly slow to get going. And I can't get the image of Nick Nolte and, even worse, Barbra Streisand, out of my head, from the godawful movie, as I try to wade through it all. I can't quite fathom what people see in this. Because things finally begin to take off at about 100 pages in, I am trying to stick with it, but other temptations are many. Only because so many others seem to love this heavy tome am I planning to finish it, no matter how bad it gets. This must appeal more to women than to men."
4,Great read,"I just finished The Prince of Tides by Pat Conroy. This book was a challenging read, but well worth the effort. The language is more difficult than I am used to but that is why I love reading books on Kindle, it is so easy to look up the meaning of words you are not familiar with. The descriptions of his childhood in South Carolina make this book absolutely facinating"
3,Prince of Tides series,"Good stories in the five book series. A little wordy, at times slow, but all and all interesting enough to keep purchasing the next book in the series. The greatest reason not to ""like,"" the series more is the end of the final book. The ending was very disappointing. It seemed to break from the well thought out progress through the first four books. The fifth book seemed like the author was forced, less coherent, wanted to finish a long job, tired of writing so much. The final chapters of the last book were ""Cute."" Different. and that's all they were. It's almost as if the author abruptly pasted on the last portion of the book. If you aren't interested in the whole, long, well worked out world the author created with three dimensional characters, and just want a shallow, different ending.I wish the author would rethink the last book sometime, and do a major revision. It has the potential to become a ""Classic,"" of it's very unusual type."
3,How to cure Savannah?,"As non-native english speaker, I'm amused with so many new phrases and words brought by Pat Conroy into this novel.The Wingos family life style is hillarious and tragic at the same time. The way Pat Conroy described the chronicle of the Wingos life is uncomparable.But at the end, as a reader, I don't know how Dr. Lowenstein to cure Savannah psychological problem. Probably, because this is not a psychological book anyway."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book, especially in as much as your eyes glide over the pages as smooth as butter. The test is very buttery, rich with images like a memory. It didn't stick with me, though, after I was done."
4,Emotionally Powerful,"Conroy's superb work on characterization in the novel allows his readers to share in the many experiences of the Wingo childeren. There are so many emotionally charged scenes that penetrate into the readers heart, allowing him to feel the overwhelming pain or pride felt by the characters. One can feel the excitement as Luke, Tom, and Savannah race back to Colleton, trying to save Snow the white porpoise, as well as the turbo-charged battle rage when the football team rallies under the roar of the tiger, Caesar. The reader becomes a part of the stroy and lives through the memories of the narrator as he recalls a painful, poignant childhood."
3,Interestingly Funny,"I was expecting more from this book. My mother and my friends had told me it was one of the best books they had ever read. The book was extremely funny when it was supposed to be, but that's all that did it for me. The prose may have been excellent writing style, but I got lost in all the imagery. Good book, but not for me."
4,Prince of Tides,"I saw the ""made for television"" movie years ago. When I finished the book, I was absolutely blown away. Good, good read! The book, of course, had so much more detail and description of the characters especially the Mother. Would definitely recommend."
4,Books That I Like,"This was a well written book and quite an exciting story line. This author being from the South, writes in a style that many southern authors use. He tries to use as many words that an average reader will have to search the dictionary in order to find their meanings. Just using plain simple english will not do for these writers. This style of writing is the result of feeling inferior due in part to speaking with a southern drawl. It is really overcompensating for a phantom problem with speaking the English Language."
5,Could not put this book down!,I loved this read. Every emotion possible was portrayed so lifelike. I will be looking into more books written by Pat Conroy very soon!
2,"Great Book, Awful Kindle Conversion","The Kindle conversion of this masterpiece is almost unreadable. Paragraphs stream together, dialog gets confusing about who's speaking."
1,2 long 2 boring,"I guess for most of the fellow reviewers, reading this book was their most ""intellectual"" experience ever, which is sad.The book is too long, the characters are pretty unreal (tragic lives supposedly caused by a tragic childhoods which in the end are not that tragic), I could go on forever, but worse of all, the story bored me to dead.But who is the greatest fool, the one who enjoyed reading it, or the one that hated it and still read it?"
1,go Barbra Streisand in the movie,"The movie was heaps better. Thank gosh it had such a wonderful actress such as Barbra Streisand, otherwise, it might have been as boring as the book. I can't believe how much I enjoyed the movie, and how little I enjoyed the book.(p.s. if you ever get a chance, see the movie. dont waste your time on the book)"
5,The sad truth that goes on behind closed doors.,"The Prince of Tides is a dramatic book of a family's fight for happiness. An emotional roller coaster that illistrated a struggle through thick and thin. If any family has been through it all it is the Wingo's. It was a book that is very enjoyable and easy to read. A book that you will never want to put down. The unexpected happend and it made it that much better. Rmantic and funny the book was amazing. I highly recomend this book to anyone looking for a good book to read. Though some parts of the book were hard to follow and you do not know what is going on, things come together and you can not believe what you are reading. I am so glad that this book was offered as a reading choice. I am intrested in reading other books by the author because the Prince of Tides was so good."
5,Amazing book,I am a visual reader who is swept away by the scenes taking place in my own head as I read. So it takes something really extraordinary to make me aware of the way language flows on the page. Conroy is that kind of extraordinary. This is his best novel ... and maybe the best novel written in the decade of the 80s.
4,good southern book,i think being from the south makes this book what it is. i suppose that most of the lower ratings are from non southerners. they just don't get the experiences that are in this book. several reviewers said the humorous espisodes were over the top. one must have southern family members to relate.the depression is somewhat intense. most of my southern relatives do not have time to dwell on themselves and to analyze each thought and action . they refuse to believe that they need help because they are too busy helping others. going to get a new hairdo is their therapy. dwelling on the need for therapy as a given arrived with the influx of people arriving from outside the south.loved this book.
4,A Hazy Kind of Beauty,"This is the first Conroy book that I have read. His writing style is unparalleled. While the plot of the book maybe a bit depressing for some, the skill with which Conroy crafts his phrases is amazing. As I read, I turned down the pages of passages that touched me...and by the end there were more pages turned down than not...I highly recommend this book, for southerners and Yankees alike."
5,Conroy is the Prince of Prose-Poetry...,"The Prince of Tides was truly a stimulating and profound novel. Aside from Tom Wingo's obsession with fine wines, french food and gorgeous women, the characters were an eclectic but passionate collection that lent themselves to a suspenseful and exhilerating read. The relationship between the siblings was one of the most compelling and beautiful relationships I have ever seen in a novel. Although depressing at times, the novel embodies our world's dual nature of pain and joy. Conroy's poetic descriptions are filled with lyrical grace while the love between the siblings reflected a peace and understanding that was simply inspiring, reminding us that courage and love can overcome all obstacles..."
3,The Novel: A collection ofshort stories held together by a dysfunctional family,"Last month I began to read Pat Conroy's ""South of Broad. After reading just over 200 pages, I put it down-utterly disappointed in the novel. I picked up a copy of ""The Prince of Tides"" instead and began to read it. For the most part I enjoyed the novel about the disfunctional Wingo family. A question to Pat Conroy: Why does you insist making Henry Wingo and his children Catholics? Being a Catholic is not the same as becoming a member of a political party or a citizen of the state of SOuth Carolina. Their ""professed"" faith adds nothing to the story. In fact I see a anti-Catholic bias since the main characters are anything but Christian in their acts and life style. Other wise I found myself engrossed in the story, until the last two chapters and epilogue. The story just loses energy at the end (Lowenstein, Lowenstein!)."
1,Boooooring,"A real snoze. This book drags on for way too many pages. If there is a plot, it is lost in the many, many pages."
5,It was better than the movie,The book uncovered a lot of the emotions of the characters in the movie. I do not recommend seeing the movie first. The book tells the story better.
2,So very overwrought!,"Mr. Conroy has never met an adjective he didn't like. I had seen and disliked the movie years ago, but came upon the book recently and thought I'd give it a try, knowing that Babs could easily have ruined it. Well, it was better than the movie, but not so great as the breathless reviews here suggest. The plot careens out of control (domestic abuse, insanity, class warfare, football, Jewish psychiatrist-temptress, neurotic violinist, twins, Vietnam, the atom bomb--oh Lord, it just never lets up for a second), the dialogue is hilariously unrealistic, and the author is one of those self-indulgent types who just loves every word that pours forth from his brain and is in dire need of a good editor. There are some good short stories buried here, and the bones of a decent book, but it boggles my mind that anyone would call this overwritten tome a life-changing experience!"
2,"the most morose, depressing, well written book I've read","The summary above says it all for me. I love to read the writing; Pat Conroy is a superb story teller. But he can't seem to get out of the deep south intercoastal nor cast his lead characters as anything other than white trash. In ""Prince"", I made it through two thirds of book until I realized that it simply became more depressing as I progressed. Don't read this book if you need uplifting. But do read it if you are an unabashed Pat Conroy fan."
1,Complete waste of time,"I baught the audio version. I can't believe I wasted so many minutes of my life on something so worthless, but I kept thinking it had to get better. You will absolutely hate your self if you spend even 5 minutes listening to this extremely anoying dribble."
1,Ridiculous,I hate that some people may judge southern writers by the crap Conroy writes. Carrying a dolphin from SC to Florida in one night? Was it wrapped up in a wet blanket or sloshing around in a bath-tub? Don't remember. What foolishness Give me a break. The crap about the tiger...who does he think he's kidding? Does he truly expect us to take his writing seriously? Does he take it seriously? Or does he simply think anyone stupid enough to buy his work will also believe it? Save your money for a bag of bricks.
1,UNFINISHABLE,"I looked at the reviews and decided to give this author a try. The worst rating I can give a book is ""unfinishable"". This book was well within the category. The story is shallow, like a bad TV miniseries, steaming with fabricated drama and endless references to tired cultural cliches. The writing is breathtakingly childish. There is no sense that any editing took place. The author makes obvious and inappropriate use of over-the-top vocabulary. These are words never seen in common usage, the kind of thing you have to look up in a dictionary. To what end, I am unsure. In conclusion, it's a very poorly written book with a weak hyper-dramatic storyline.......unfinishable, to be sure."
3,DVD,"Sound quality is wonderful. Frank Muller does a great job of reading Conroy's work. But when you put CDs into computer, most of the tracks come up blank, or with a completely different artist name and incorrect name of book, also wrong and duplicated chapter names. Chapter names have nothing to do with book."
5,Touches the heart!,I just had to put this book on my kindle. My favorite book! Pat Conroy is an amazing writer. Can't wait to read it again!
5,A whirlpool of emotions,"Tom Wingo a white middle class man with a strong identity as a Southener, and who grew up in the marshes of Colleton, SC near Charleston, tells the story of his traumatic childhood when he goes to New York City to see the shrink of his depressed sister who was at the brink of killing herself, those early years growing up under the care of distressing parents, according to him, left deep scars in his soul and those of his siblings Savanna and Luke. The story is full of very moving situations, it features a dark hidden secret like those found in the great mystery novels. Character development is great as each one makes a different world of itself. The most singular gift of the author is his narrative ability to express everything, using remarks full of rethorical figures bearing ingrained pieces of wisdom, the captivating intensity of the tragedy unfolds from beginning to end. This book will remain forever as one of my favorite novels"
5,Prince of Tides,"Great novel, can't put it down. About human emotions and family drama set in a beautiful part of the world. Love it."
5,extraordinary! a true masterpiece!,What a truly magnificent piece of art. Thank you Mr. Conroy for sharing this jewel with me. It has touched my soul and therefore is now a part of me.
4,"a good story, just too long","I found the story of Tom Wingo's abusive and fascinating past to be thoroughly entertaining and a story that made me want to keep reading. Conroy uses words masterfully to describe his story and to keep the reader enthralled. Conroy uses images and foreshadowing greatly to make the reader keep reading to find out what happened to Luke, or what Lila had done to make her children hate her. When I finished the book I wanted there to be more. It was a great book to read, only it was too long for me, as it contained some scenes I thought were unnecassary. I would suggest it to anyone who likes an entertaining story and has time to read."
5,Simply magnificent in every way,"I am a 16 year old male (going into junior year) and I had to read ""The Prince of Tides"" for summer reading for English 3 Honors. If I could use one word for this book, it is ""perfect"". Words can't even describe the amount of emotion and detail used in this particular novel. I think there's a little bit of Tom Wingo in all of us. I did find it somewhat disturbing, but it was great. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good book."
2,GREAT FILM...poorly rendered,"A beautiful young woman (ravishing Catherine Deneuve) with a ""repulsion"" toward men, slowly sinks into madness and murder. Creepy and terrifying, this is among Roman Polanski's best work. The film is ***** all the way. It deserves far better treatment than this murky pan-and-scan DVD version that looks like it was video taped off a late night TV showing. Let's hope somebody at Criterion thinks it's at least as worthwhile as ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" and ""The Blob."""
3,Definitely makes me repulsed.,"Let me get this straight. We're supposed to believe that this girl goes mad just because she isn't having sex? Or are we supposed to see her lack of sexual activity as a sign of something more severe?In my humble opinion, the fact that she's repulsed by sex in the first place is in itself a signal of her madness and not anything that progressively happens when she's alone in the apartment.Of course, the movie never clues us in as to what is the culprit for her repulsion, and frankly that aspect of it, as well as the movie itself really grates on my nerves.I guess a man who drugged and raped a 12 year old then ran overseas to escape justice would be attracted to the idea of directing this, not to mention thinking this plot made sense.Psychological thrillers have always left me with an uneasy feeling, but many I can watch more quickly than this. If you must watch a Rapist Polanski, I mean Roman Polanski film, watch his version of Macbeth, or Rosemary's Baby."
1,IT STINKS!!!,"This is a review of the Criterion Release, and the only good thing I can say about it is that the print looks quite good, up to Criterion's usual standards. Thankfully I rent before I buy an expensive Criterion DVD, so I'm not out the purchase price. How bad is the movie? After watching this I had the urge to stick the DVD in my broiler and watch it melt. My wife and I are fans of Polanski -- we love Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown, so we figured there must be something worthwhile about this film. We were SO wrong. It's interminably slow. Tedious. Pretentious. Stupid. It has moments that are laughably bad. It contains some of the worst music in a movie, ever. The characters have no personality. It makes no sense. It's not scary. There's no suspense. IT JUST STINKS!!!! Save $30 and 105 minutes of your life by not buying or watching this turkey!"
1,cover art,"I am disappointed with Criterion's artwork for this. A real lack of effort, if you ask me.I can picture numerous stills from the movie that would've served excellent duty as cover art.I'm thrilled this is being released in the first class Criterion way but I feel they dropped the ball with the cover art."
4,Almost a 5.,"Surreal tale of madness. A beautiful woman sinks into an hallucinatory world full of symbolism and illusions, eventually leading her to the point where unspeakable acts might bring her life to a crashing end. Polanski gets inside her mind and drags us in with him. Disturbing, ahead of its time, and masterfully crafted, Repulsion is one of the ten best horror films I have even seen."
5,Polanski and Deneuve at their best!,"An daring and close study of a sexually oppresed woman(Deneuve) who had a complete broke down that eventually led to murder when her sister left her alone at home for a few days. Deneuve's performance is so strong and believable, while Polanski follows Hitchcock's foot step by using every surrounding object to underline the distortion of a mind. A film with real style and eerie beauty. The image and sound are reasonable well for a 1965 film. A must!"
1,"Great Movie (5 stars), Awful DVD (below 1 star)","First let me state that I love this movie; I had a VHS copy of it and simply wanted to upgrade...Unfortunately, in many instances, while playing it, I didn't know if I was watching a lower quality VHS copy (i.e., the $3.99 EP type that you find in the bargain bins of large chain stores) or if I had indeed the DVD on.Criterion Collection: where are you? You need to save this one!!!Don't waste your money on this version! Hope for the future!"
5,"Reviews on Amazon Done Prior to July 28, 2009 Are Bogus","The Criterion version of Repulsion was approved by Roman Polanski. It was released on July 28, 2009. Any review that is dated prior to the release date of July 28, 2009 and which primarily criticizes the quality of the DVD (or is of a VHS taped version) is completely irrelevant to the Criterion version. Criterion's face-lift is clear as a bell and reveals little details that prior transfers failed to resolve. It suffers from none of the technical limitations of older transfers.As to the merits of the film, it is frighteningly horrific, weird and sick, and incredibly claustrophobic--a great psychological thriller. If you want to see a horror film and like having the pants scared off of you, I promise you will not be repulsed by your choice. It's a superb character study, and Catherine Deneuve's acting is top notch. It made me never want to live in an apartment again."
3,"Interesting movie, but a bit slow","The physical DVD itself is fine, but the movie was a bit boring. It was cool how nuts she went, and I appreciated the imagery, but I don't think this was Polanski's best. It was not a bad movie, but it's not even comparable to the pianist."
1,Movie is great - This DVD release is HORRIBLE,"Don't buy this. Seriously. Someone is bound to release a better version. This is PAN AND SCAN, cropped at 1:33, and seems to be transferred from some sort of used tape...Like a 3/4 inch VHS. There are visible tape flutters and wrinkles throughout the film. And no it's NOT the print. The film is fine. It's the transfer. cheap, cheap, cheap.The compression is abysmal (notice the obvious scan lines on the titles) and the sound is piss poor. How is it possible this is the only way this film is available in the US? Disgraceful."
1,Brilliant film; unwatchable tape,"REPULSION is a classic suspense film, worth of watching over and over again to capture all its subtleties. However, this specific tape is of such poor quality that watching the film is almost impossible. The video is smeary and indistinct, but worst of all the sound is so muffled that nearly all of the dialogue is rendered unintelligible. Please see this film; however, make sure you don't make the mistake I did of renting/buying this edition."
3,Voyeuristic fluff,"I've had this on old VHS, a horrible dvd transfer and now this Blu-ray... to me after all these years it's basically another cheap Polanski fluff film. I view it as a voyeuristic film grope of Catherine Deneuve and nothing more. I'll have to watch it again with commentary on to see if Polanski has some cheap explanation of the story, I just hope he doesn't blame the holocaust yet again, ""the holocaust made me molest the child"" etc... there is some style in the way it's filmed, but not much more than a cheap thrill of watching Deneuve traipsing around and apparently have some type of breakdown. I don't believe in Freud and his resulting mind control BS, psychiatry etc... so I don't think calling her schizophrenic really means anything since it's all pseudo science at best. Catherine Deneuve makes this a 3 star film, take her out and it's basically nothing."
4,Just imagine...,"...being in the audience of a theater that was showing this for the first time back in the 1960s. The slow decay of the star is even unnerving in this day and age and I'm sure it was a shock back then. It was an enjoyable movie and was pretty disturbing, but thanks to all the desensitization of the modern age, it will probably lose some of its scarier parts due to the fact that it's just not ""that scary"" nowadays. The star really made it seem like to the viewer that you were truly watching someone unravel. The Criterion version has a nice crisp transfer in B&W and it is great! Recommended!!"
1,Baffled by the praise.,"As a huge fan of independent film and Roman Polanski, I watched this alone late last night on my cable system's free On-Demand service, bracing myself to be shocked, terrified, and appalled. Am I ever thankful I could fast-forward through much of it. Acting? Plot? Cinematography? Screenplay? Are you kidding me? This was without doubt one of the worst excuses for a film I've seen in recent memory. Even transporting myself back to the time of London in the '60's, I saw no evidence of the attributes upon which others so lavishly heap their praise. Deneuve is practically catatonic through most of it. I am simply shocked and appalled by the professional critics and filmgoers who see this as a masterpiece, and terrified that this is what passes for great cinema."
2,"""Most terrifying""??? Awful!","I'm a huge fan of the film Rosemary's Baby and was excited to finally watch this. What a horrible film! It was billed as ""the most terrifying film ever made"". So what happened? This film is boring, tedious, and about as ""terrifying"" as watching a cat hiss at a fly.I don't understand all the hype surrounding this ""classic"". Very boring. Don't bother."
1,"NOT the scariest, most disturbing, or a masterpiece","This film is more annoying than anything else. Saying it is a masterpiece because it is Polanski's first film in English is like saying ""not bad...for a girl."" It is clear he did not understand how to use language in the film (probably why there is so little of it). And suffering through Carol's zombie-like states is mind numbing and makes the viewer want to slap some sense into her.Agreed, Rosemary's Baby is one of his best and can be classified as one of the great psycho-thrillers but comparisons to Hitchcock can only be made to say that Polanski is a student of the Hitchcock method, but never quite surpasses it in any film. Repulsion is an interesting start, but a bad film by any standard."
1,Awful and just plain outdated. Don't waste your time.,"Every watch what you thought was a good movie back when you were 10 and then saw it as an adult and realized what a terrible movie it was? Repulsion is a movie that for some reason was considered great in 1965 but in reality by todays standards it would never have been released. The movie is just awful and more importantly, boring beyond belief. There is nothing here worth watching. I don't know what they saw in this movie in 1965 but after seeing so many good movies throughout my life this rates at the very bottom. Look for my other reviews and see some really good movies. I have a list of the 100 Greatest Movies You Never Saw."
2,"psychological? ok, entertaining, no!","this movie is all pychological [stuff] about a woman all fearful of sex. but that's it, nothing really happens. the first hour is people talking about nothing relevant and then the woman has hallucinations about being attacked, it's not scary, it's just boring, and for those who say, ""oh gee, it's pychological, you have to understand the gritty details"" i say, ""this movie [is bad],..."
5,Excellent Buy,"I've had this Flat TV for 2 years now, it has a sharp picture, great surround sound and very cool features. The most interesting however is that it gives pure sound when you connect the ""Headphone jack"" to the sound system. This gives me the option of either using the auxilary output or the headphones jacks with the same quality! Impressive! Toshiba rules!"
3,White Wolves: A Cry In The Wild II,"A Two Week Camping Trip through The Mountains Tests The Maturity And Concentration Of Five Teens...At First, It's All A Good Time, White Water Rafting, Hiking, And Making New Friends...But When Their Leader Falls Over A Cliff, His Students Must Pull Together And Rescue Him...Very Predictable Film About Teens Learning To Understand Each Other And Challenge Mother Nature's Stakes...Starring: Ami Dolenz (Miracle Beach, Virtual Seduction) Mark Paul Gosselaar (Saved By The Bell) Matt McCoy (Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Police Acadamey)"
5,Adventure Movie,"Good adventure, team work, and sacrafice for other human beings. I like the wilderness setting, and the part about a juvenile delinquent who learns about helping others in spite of the chip on his shoulder."
4,Deleted Scenes?,"I grew up watching this movie and still love it! However, if you are going to buy it, you might want to buy the VHS version other than the DVD. We used to rent this movie as kids all the time and recently bought the DVD...we have come to find that the DVD has been edited. The scene where they are climbing the mountain and Adam gets to scared to keep moving has been cut. I'm sure there are other things cut out as well, but this is all we can remember. Even if you look at the running times, the DVD runs 74 mins, while the tape runs 90."
1,rubbish!,this was the worst dvd ever created maybe if there were a few more explosions and car chases it would have been better but this was just plain bad. This and snake eyes were the only dvds i ever fell asleep in the middle of. People who buy this should have their heads checked.

3,Some Features Missing,"I hadn't really thought of more than a working instant-off switch as a requirement, because my last tea kettle did lift off of a docking station and did have a lid you could open. It just didn't turn off until half the water had boiled away.So I bought this one, it is inexpensive and the one reviewer loved it.It never occurred to me that a cord could be so incredibly inconvenient, but there is no way to detach the kettle and cord, not even a plug at the kettle.Moreover, the kettle really has no opening save for the spout. That is fine for now, but if anything gets in there, we're pretty much stuck. You can't even see inside.It may last us a long time, but I'm definitely going to look for a cordless kettle next time, or at least for one that I can unplug at the base."
1,"Horribly, horribly ugly","I completely agree with the person who said the pearls are snowman-shaped and have a large ugly groove in them. And the grossly malformed pearl was attached to the peridot chips at a crooked angle, so they don't even hang right.Ugly, ugly, ugly."
3,Just like the amethyst ones,"If you don't expect round pearls and don't care that your pearls have these icky looking threads running around the middle of it, then these will do if you want pearl and peridot earrings. I like the color and really debated whether to return them or not because of the crappy pearl, but hey hopefully no one will be fascinated by the lovely color contrast and want to get a closer look. I'm never buying another pearl jewelry from Amazon because of these pearl earrings though."
1,Made In China,"I ordered the Mr. Bar B Q set because it was advertised as Made in the USA, but when I received the product it was clearly marked Made in China. This was clearly a misrepresentation. I can't speak for the quality of the product since I am returning the item unopened."
3,Almost!,"Here's the problem. Hollywood thinks that they have to make up stuff for a movie to be good. It is amazing that they cannot see that the real stories are far more entertaining and interesting than their made up cookie cutter plots. It is insulting to our intelligence. This movie had a chance (especially with Angus as Blackbeard) but blew it on wrong costumes, fake story, bad dialog, the works. What is wrong with Hollywood? Everything! If they did make a real movie of Blackbeard (or any one of hundreds of truly interesting and great historical figures) the force of all the money coming in to the studio all at once would knock this type of movie off the screens - forever!"
2,Ham acting is quite funny,"Blackie is over the top acting to the point of comedy, but not like johhny depp.old star track funny where the laughs come from actor's lack of skills."
5,Great Movie - Pure Enjoyment,"Surprisingly funny and well done. A lot of action and good story line which surprised me, as I have a few other pirate movies that are poorly made with a cheesy script. A great family movie worth buying and watching over again. Hey Hollywood, get this...........a really good movie WITHOUT using the ""f-bomb."""
4,Blackbeard movie review,"This is a very entertaining look at a true historical story that the whole family(over 10) can watch. Though there's some realistic violence, it's not R-rated. The movie inspired me to look up the actual history. Aside from the location(Blackbeard spent most of his time off the Carolina coast, not the Caribbean) and a few historical embellishments it's pretty accurate."
3,Not bad but not great.,What can you say? A Hallmark film. The acting was pretty solid but the fight scenes needed a little work. It really wasn't that bad. Some other review said that it was better than Pirates of the Caribbean 3 but that is simply not true.
3,"Ugh, not sure about this one...","This made-for-TV movie does no real honor to the real Edward Teach (Blackbeard) or Lt. Robert Maynard but could be considered enjoyable fare for those with lower expectations.Please bear in mind that I am a history major with a fascination with the Age of Sail and mane of my next comments are nitpicking only.1. The pirates' costumes were not period and at one point were scrubbing the decks of Blackbeard's ship Queen Anne's Revenge with brooms instead of holystones.2. The strong and independent female lead was a little out of place and seemed to find men's clothing that fit very well quickly after her dress was dirty and torn.3. Oh, I should just stop.Perhaps if some deleted scenes or a better TRUE history segment had been included with the special features, I might have enjoyed this movie more. But I am notorious for nitpicking historical films.Give it a try, you never know!"
2,"Makes me go urrrggghhh, not arrgggh!","I thought, OK, pirates, how bad can it be. Trust me, from the very first scene, this was bad:Opening scene, a map of England is shown, and the area down in the lower right corner is labeled Wales, when it should be Cornwall(although Cardiff is shown up where Wales is).When we're introduced to Stacy Keach's character, he has a patch over his eye. Too bad there's a visible hole through it so he can see.When the opening sea battle is shown, the 'Queen Anne's Revenge' is shown about 100 yards astern of the French ship she's pursuing, but suddenly fires a broadside.The dialogue is so bad, I expect the scurvy dogs to say ""What up?"" and ""Far out""(kind of like inThe Count of Monte Cristowhen Luis Guzman as Jacopo says ""Okay""), but they at least should have used ""Larboard"" rather than ""Port"".This makes me want to send the makers of this film the Black Spot!"
4,Great yarn if not always true,"I think there are a lot of liberties taken in this film (i.e. the romance between Maynard, the captain who killed Blackbeard, and his doctor-girlfriend, but it is a fun yarn and gives the flavor, if not always the facts, of what Blackbeard was all about. Just a lot of fun, and I would think a good way of introducing young people to a real historical character."
3,A Fair Deal,"I should not have expected much, for $195. The good points: easy slide, and angle changes. The stock holding clamp is fine. The laser is accurate (however, battery operation not ideal. It has a vac port, and comes with dust bag. The drawbacks: very loud, the electronic brake doesn't stop blade fast enough, and only a 60T blade (and made in China). Overall a good value...best as a second or back-up unit, for occasional use, or as an ""on the truck"" tool."
1,Flimsy Plastic Tool Sheild Is a big drawback,After Limited use the Plastic tool guard became warped and now is useless becasue it catches on the blade.The really bad thing is that I can not find where to get a replacement sheild for this product. I can not find a website to order a replacement guard.
1,cross cut not accurate,"I bought this saw over a year ago and Im disgust with it. For one, the motor makes too much noise for start but the main turn off is that the saw is not accurate on cross cutting.....piece of s..t."
2,Beware!,"It frightens me to find people turning to self help books to learn to sing. I have devoted over twenty years of my life to learning aboout and teaching the art of singing. Books can be helpful guides, but there is no substitute for a trained teacher of singing. Do not rely on books alone. Every voice, like every person, is different, and there are no pat answers for any vocal difficulties. Only the ears, expertise, knowledge, and heart of a trained singer will help you to truly find the voice within you."
2,Some Flaws & Problems,"I purchased this printer about three months ago to replace a b&w HP printer, and initially I was really excited about the features. Unfortunately, I've been pretty disappointed.Positives: Decent price. The copier is pretty good and can also do color copies.Neutral aspects: The scanner is decent, although it doesn't do well with reading some fonts. I've also had a fair number of scanner paper jams.Negatives: The printer is *very* slow, even when printing b&w Word documents. I've also had problems with the b&w cartridge - it doesn't seem to do well with certain brands of cartridges. Finally, every few weeks, it just stops printing for a day or two. I've never had these problems with any of my other HP printers.Overall, I don't recommend this printer."
3,Not plug & play,"Definetly not plug & play. Took nearly six hours, several calls to technical support, three visits to HP site & one (at HP's suggestion) to microsoft. Part of problem is that this product is not necessarily ready for Windows 2K. But HP doesn't tell you this in the installation info. So, its only when you give in to frustration and call HP that they tell you, ""oh yeah go to micfor soft and install Service Pack Two"" that this becomes clear. (From the desktop, right click ""My Computer"" and look in ""Properties"" to see if you have Service Pack One or Two.)Second problem was in trying to install using USB cable. I was unable to complete this even with HP support--they gave up & said call for a new installation disk. I gave up and used the parallel cable."
2,HP Officejet K80 is the Most Difficult Printer to Install,"I had installed many printers in the past, and this is the hardest to install. It worked fine for a month after I installed this printer with my new Windows XP computer, then all of a sudden the scanning function stopped working. I couldn't even uninstall the software. After being on the phone, twice, with HP technical support, the problem still wasn't resolved. I highly do not recommend this printer to anyone, even to those who know how to troubleshoot computers or modify Windows registry."
1,I hate this pitcher,"The lid doesn't lock down and needs to be held when pouring. Even when held, if there's any water in the unfiltered section, it will leak out as you pour. If there's water in the unfiltered section and you DONT hold the lid, the lid will pop off and that water will unleash itself onto your floor. I hate this pitcher!"
2,Brita Riviera Pitcher with digital change filter indicator,The digital change filter indicator was the attraction to this pitcher however I find that the hinged cover over the pouring lip tends to stick. This makes it difficult to get a good stream for pouring. I had the previous pitcher without the digital indicator and probably will return to using it. The filtering system itself is great and I highly recommend a different model of the Brita.
2,Awkward,"The filters are nice. I owned an older model that I liked but this one is a disappointment. The lids fall off, the water spills out and the shape makes it uncomfortable to hold the weight. Maybe it would be okay if you don't put it in the door of the refrigerator, but that is what the slim design is supposed to be for. I wish manufacturers would actually take their product home and try it before they market it. I'll probably be frustrated one day and through it out."
2,Flippin' lid flips off,"Extremely disappointed in the flip-top design, it constantly falls off during the pouring process. They really need to address this design flaw. If you are considering buying a Brita pitcher, you should consider choosing a different model, with a different lid design. I also agree with others in this forum about the electronic filter change indicator -- it counts off the days despite usage. And it was difficult to accurately set it. And don't be mislead by the color moniker of ""chrome"" - it's a pale gray plastic. I really would like a do-over on my selection! Flippin' flip top is irritating!"
2,Good water filter but has flaws,I bought this model by looking at the reviews above when I got it home and started to use it I was disappointed with the cover when you pour the water out it does not pour smooth in fact the cover will either pop off or the water will splash out when being poured ending up on the floor. The digital change filter indicator is a joke it does not tell you if you have actually need to change the filiter it is like a calender and in 2 weeks a bar will be removed. The pitcher it self is very ackward to handle. The water is good but there is a after taste.The replacement filters are a little on the expensive side Not worth the money
3,Brita pitcher,I like the shape but the cover is very flimsy and light feels like a plastic toy and will break anytime.
2,weak cover,"this particular one with the silver cover, i wouldnt recommend anyone to get. its very weak and delicate. the cover is in two parts. i bought three cos they look good from the picture. one is broken(cover) already and its less than a weak old and am shipping the other two to africa. if yu have kids home, dont get dis kind either in white or silver. spend a lil more money to get the durable ones. this is basura"
2,not impresed with product,Product was defective. Called manufacturer and they replaced product which still does not work very well. Both top sections would not fit correctly and would fall off when attempting to pour water.
5,An amazing product,"I drink ice water constantly. My nickname at one point a few years ago was ""Ice Water."" So I love cold drinking water. Ipso facto, I love my Brita. I use it all the time and couldn't be happier.I change the filter about once a year. Brita says to change it every 3 months but I think that is ridiculous. After about 9 or 10 months you'll notice a change in the taste. And that's when I change it out. Other than that, this thing is indispensable to my life."
4,Slim design saves shelf space,I like the pitcher because of it's narrow design. It takes a lot less shelf space in my refrigerator than my previous Brita pitcher.
3,Product In Excellent Condition! Costumer service cero!,Wrote to the a couple of emails and never got an answer. Had no idea the product was on its way when suddenly I received a package.
4,takes less space,"This pitcher is nice and thin, so it doesn't take up as much room in the refrigerator where space is precious."
2,difficult to use,"Our old Brita pitcher warped when left too close to a hot burner, so we chose this newer model for its space-saving qualities and capacity. We have been so disappointed! Unlike other reviewers we find the thumb-tab reservoir opener easy to use. But ergonomically the pitcher is a disaster. When full, it takes two hands to pour water, one to life it and one to steady it. it is just so heavy, and the narrow design means it is unbalanced when pouring. The little lip on the spout does often stick, so when the pressure of the pouring water finally opens it, it is with a gush.Despite this model's hefty pricetag, we will have to buy a different Brita. if narrow, we'll get one with a smaller capacity, but I'm leaning towards the old-fashioned round design. (Wish they'd make a handsome opaque pitcher to leave on the kitchen counter for cooking and making tea and coffee.)"
1,Take a Pass on This One,"I got rid of a perfectly good water pitcher in order to ""upgrade"" to this snazzy model. The chrome look fit in perfectly with the kitchen of my new house, so I thought I was making a solid decorating decision. I have regretted that move every day since. This pitcher, although functional, leaks. It leaks from the front when I pour water into a glass--to the extent that I can only pour over the sink because it ends up everywhere. When I fill the reservoir and lift it to put it into my refrigerator, it often leaks out the back. I don't recall ever encountering such a poorly designed product. I mean, it's supposed to hold water. You would THINK they'd design it so it doesn't leak. Mind you, there is nothing wrong with the pitcher that would cause it to leak; it simply isn't well made. Frankly, I am disgusted with Brita and will never purchase another one of their poorly designed products again."
1,Cheap plastic lid ....hinges broke after two mouths......,Love this pitcher. However only had it for two months and the chip plastic hinges on the top that opens and close BROKE. Cheap plastic. Just broke off. I do not want to wrap the darn thing up and send it back.I hate it when you by something and it falls apart. I can see the lid is attached with a plastic hinge that breaks very easily. I guess we are stuck with it for awhile.
3,Mind the lid,"The pitcher is a nice size but the lid does not fit snugly and it falls off when you... um... try to pour water.UPDATE: Raised from 1 to 3 stars. After a month of using it, we finally noticed two very small pins where the lid clicks into place. It took us a bugger of a time to get it in the right position, though.If you find the front lid falls off at the slightest pouring angle, fumble with it until it clicks into place. This may take you 10 or 15 minutes to get it to set, but it stays there once it's there."
2,The water spots on the chrome parts are hard to polish.,"If you're interested in the Chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots. My friend owns one and at first I was envious, but now I rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots. This model has the same shape as the Riviera and as I stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic, the Riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so I would be skeptical in buying this one.The only reason I gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you can't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly."
1,broke & its awkward,"I don't even know how this thing broke, but it did. Its the 2nd one to break like that. I will never buy another brita pitcher w/ a flip lid. the shape of it is always weird and awkward too."
