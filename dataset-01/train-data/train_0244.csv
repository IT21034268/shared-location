1,Wont import my TurboTax file from last year,The prodcut says it will import TurboTax data from last year. However the product fails to import and Tech Support tells me my file is too large (100k). They say the only way to import is to open the file in last years TurboTax (I threw away) and reduce the file size and then import.Both TurboTax and TaxCut get failing grades this year. They both should be ashamed of themselves.
2,Next year its back to Turbo Tax for me!!,"Yikes! This was a nightmare for me. I thought I'd try TaxCut out this year and I'm sorry I did. I used Turbo Tax last year and I felt as though I always knew what was being done, but this was not so for TaxCut. TaxCut never showed me the final form until I searched all over the software to find the right link.I recommend Turbo Tax whole heartedly!"
1,Problems with TaxCut,"I read about the bad things about TurboTax this year, so switched to TaxCut. But it has problems.1. It doesn't know about the handling of ESPP or Options,in this edition, no question about ESPP or option isasked. You have to do you own calculations (e.g. the ESPPgain is already included in W-2 etc.), I ended updoing the math manually myself.2. It cannot do E-file behind firewall, or even home networks!I am stuck now, cannot do E-file! I used to do E-file withthe same network with Turbox Tax last year without problem!This is per TaxCut tech support that you can't file if youare behind firewall.3. Other misc usability issues.I would recommand getting Turbox Tax and that third partysoftware to wipe out those bad softwares."
2,Customer Support,"While the program is great,the customer support system is lacking. I called the 800 phone number for a recorded message that directed me to a long distance phone number. When I dialed that phone number, another voice message instructed me to dial a different long distance phone number. Two long distance phone calls later I spoke with a customer service representative that was not very helpful."
2,Glitches,"I never thought I'd find a glitch in a reputable tax accounting software program but TaxCut Deluxe has one. This probably wouldn't affect 99.9% of potential buyers, but it did affect me. My daughter had unearned income of over $1500 last year from sale of stocks. She is 12 years old, and the tax program picked up on this and stated it would generate the ""kiddie tax"" but it won't figure it out for you. You need to know your gross income, but you can't access that on the return at the time. It tells you to complete Form 8615 which you can't do until you complete your return first. Very frustrating."
1,Unhappy TaxCut user.,"I have used TurboTax for the last 10 years, but based on the recommendations of people who wrote rave reviews about TaxCut; I thought I would try it. I found it to be very confusing and went out to day and purchased TurboTax. I have a used TaxCut if anyone is interested."
4,Good Product - it gets the job done,"I'm one of those who switched to TaxCut this year because of TurboTax's activation scheme. It's too bad since I consider it to be a great product and have used it for several years. However, it's not so great a product that I'd bother with its non-value adding hurdles - I've got better things to do with my time, like my taxes.TaxCut is good - not as good as TurboTax in my opinion. Still, it imported my TurboTax file without a hitch and I did my federal and state taxes in about an hour. However, there was some bugginess with updating the state tax forms - it took a few tries.Also, it's cheaper!If TaxCut decides to follow the path of distrusting its customers, then I may very well just switch back to TurboTax, unless the price difference is too much."
2,The End,"I went to TaxCut because of the spyware problem in TurboTax last year. The program started out fine, but would not end, and could not make electronic submissions to Fed or State. Talked to everyone in TaxCut and I felt I was debuging the program. Had to snail mail the State after finally getting the Fed return to work. Took an extra two weeks to do this."
1,Just say NO!,"I was lured to TaxCut by spyware mistake in TurboTax. I cannot reget more. For:a. Immensely lower quality. Items left marked ""To Do"" after I gone through them several times. Questions asked ""Are you subject to ...?"" In order to use this program you must know already everything in tax law, or its plain useless unless you return is extremely simple.b. And it finally got my return REJECTED!! Why? I did not supply Electronic Funds Withdrawal amount and date! Check printout, I DID supply. OK, proposed solution: refile a return, select check as a payment option. Now it does not allow me to refile a return since in has already been filed. Technical support? Forget about it, holiday.Advice: avoid HR Block at all costs. Or at least until their software team is fired without reverence package.Good luck to you, taxpayer."
1,Awful Program,"After reading the comments about TurboTax's registration policy, I abandoned years of its use in favor of TaxCut, and this was a mistake. Those reviews must have been written by TaxCut employees.TaxCut's interview asks you things like, ""Do you need form 2112-yyz?"" I don't know those answers; just ask me simple questions as TurboTax does. For some reason TaxCut thinks I own a business, although I don't. Now I believe in ""garbage in / garbage out"" and take some responsibility for a wrong answer somewhere throughout the interview, but I never suffered this confusion in any of the years I used TurboTax. Anyhow, I'm stuck in a cycle where I fix errors only to generate more errors. When I fix those I get the first set of errors again. It's maddening.A friend used TurboTax this year, and didn't find the registration process intrusive in the least."
2,Better than Turbotax? NO,"I used TurboTax for the past two years. After reading the review about TaxCut, got fooled to buy this product.My wife has only Tax Payer ID (TIN), with that the state program didn't start to work and complained SSN is not correct! Customer service says update the latest from the website, looks like standard answer, that doesn't solve the problem. They never tested this simple thing I guess. Finally I found a workaround, enter some random SSN number for my wife and proceed to State program and then come back and change the SSN. What the heck? Then what about any complex calculations? How can you be sure that it has been tested?I crosschecked my tax calculations manually to make sure it matches before e-filing. Good news is I got the refund in 8 days, a big relief to me.I'll going back to TurboTax, no doubt."
3,"It's bad, but not as bad as TurboTax","It's better than TurboTax (which I used last year) because it's easier to navigate the interview in TaxCut.The help is equally bad for both programs, i.e. only answering most of the basic questions (but not all) and none of the complicated ones. The help does have some good examples, if your situation happens to resemble the examples.TaxCut's main advantage over TurboTax is price. It took me about 2 hours less than it would have taken to do manually (I estimate), which makes it barely worth the [monety] it cost.The TaxCut State program, for me, was a waste of money. Sure, there's a rebate to make it free, but the numbers it came up with were so improbably high that I ended up doing the state by hand. The state program apparently can't understand how one person could be a resident but the spouse can be a nonresident, so if you're not in this rare category it might work for you."
2,TaxCut is horrible!,"I decided I would try TaxCut this year instead of Turbo Tax since it had so much bad publicity. Well TaxCut was a big mistake. It was very confusing to use and would constantly come up with different refund ammounts every time I opened the program, even after saving it! I called tech support and they gave me the ""Well its not us, it must be you"" answer. I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING TAXCUT NEXT YEAR!! I will most likely go back to Turbo Tax, which served me very good the last three years. Hopefully Turbo Tax gets their act together and changes things for next year because TAXCUT IS HORRIBLE!!"
4,No Product Activation / Spy ware,"Purchased TurboTax as I do each year. This year dueto big problems with the Product Activation I returnedTurboTax and purchased TaxCut. Not only did I have no troublerunning the software, it imported all of my data from lastyears TurboTax files."
3,Needs More Work,"Because of Windows XP-related problems with this year's TurboTax, I tried TaxCut for the first time. It was a bit buggy: It didn't like your current address being different from your W2 addresses, especially if the state was different (this issue caused problems throughout, and foiled my attempts to e-file my state return), display problems at screen resolution greater than 1024x768, context-sensative help didn't always work (online help in general was clunky - I often went to IRS.GOV instead), some forms (all support forms) didn't print properly. TurboTax also has better historical and comparison features. All in all, TaxCut is OK, but I'll go back to TurboTax when they fix their Windows XP problems."
1,Doesn't work in California,"I bought this because TurboTax instituted it new one computer policy. It is not worth the money.Federal and state deductions are different in CA, and TaxCut calculated the state deductions incorrectly.It's user-interface was not user friendly.The help site at IRS.gov was easier to use and understand than the help with this product.The error checking created more errors than it caught, and ended up creating a loop so that I had to manually fill in the forms to fix.In the end, it told me that it could not electronically file a standard form in California. It can only file the EZ form, and I would have to print out my forms and mail them in.By the time I downloaded the extra forms and worksheets needed for this progam, battled with the software, and was rejected by the e-filing system, I could have filled in the forms by hand with a calculator and done a less frustrating, faster, and better job."
2,Novice Tax Person,"TaxCut made my tax filing slightly easier for me. The program does not explain tax lingo sufficiently. Because of this program, I am extremely frustrated since I do not understand anything the program explained. As a result, I have many errors on my tax return. I am very new to doing my taxes on my own. In previous years, accountants did my taxes for me."
2,Has Some Problems,"My kids had investment income which generated the ""kiddie tax"". TaxCut has me running in 5 different directions with different forms to compute this. The problem is I'm not sure it's correct. I will probably have to see a tax accountant to ensure this has been properly computed. Seems to me this program should be able to handle any type of tax problem."
1,TaxCut made a $3300 error on my taxes,"As with many others, I bought TaxCut because of the spyware issues with TurboTax. What a mistake! TaxCut misinterprets a fairly important tax law change from 2001 which allows employees to contribute to both a tax-deferred 403(b) and 457(b) plan. The tax law allows contributions up to $11,000 in 2002 to each of these plans, for a total of $22,000. TaxCut incorrectly added back $11,000 to my income because it believed I was making an ""excess contribution"" to these plans ... which makes a $3,300 difference to my tax bill. TurboTax interprets the law correctly ... so I'm spending another $... to go back to it."
3,Don't Buy This,"I bought TaxCut because of all the bad things said now about turbotax. However, it is buggy. In fed, it never prompts u to enter 1099G forms. This can cost u an audit.In state (NJ), it never prompts you to enter medical deductions. It just silently uses the federal numbers. However, this is wrong. The state numbers are not the same as fed. If u have medical FSA, it cannot itemized on federal, but can be on state. Even worse, on fed, it asks if you have more than 7.5% med expenses, otherwise, don't bother entering. So I didn't enter any med deductions. NJ state is 2%, so I would be able to deduct but taxcut never prompts for it. Just silently puts 0 from fed. Also, it won't e-file if I manually update state med deductions directly in form. Called Tech Support, explained them problems, but they are clueless. Kept telling me to go to hire a tax advisor. :("
2,Will go back to TurboTax,"I agree 100% with the last review from March 28. I also had some income on a W-2 and other income from self-employment. TaxCut made me fill out more than 1 form manually, one of which I had to download off of the IRS web site. Also, I had to be sure to delete any forms I decided not to use on review - answering No to use the form during the interview will not erase answers previously entered. TaxCut really let me down. The only positive thing I can say is that it did import my TurboTax information and as a whole ran well on XP. I switched from TurboTax because in past years the IRS has made adjustments to my return making me think TurboTax was doing something wrong. Maybe I still made the right decision - since I had to fill out forms manually, my return may be more accurate this year."
1,BUY TURBOTAX !,"I decided that I would try the less expensive alternative to Turbotax, a software program I have used for 5 years, with flawless service. I had to calculate mileage for business, although we receive partial compensation for that mileage. What a joke ! taxcut does nothing to assist with simple calculations with business expenses, so I tried customer service... a much, much bigger joke. After 4 emails, and being advised to claim ourselves as a separate business, we rec'd this in an email-""Our Technical Support team provides technical expertise for issues pertaining to TaxCut software. If you have a specific tax question or need tax advice we recommend that you contact the IRS""...So, if the software doesn't work for your pasrticular situation, too bad. Call the IRS. May as well go to the post office and buy a #2 pencil.We never had this problem with TURBOTAX. Taxcut is a one time mistake. Save yourself the time, moneey, and frustration. I want software that works."
1,Worse than you could possibly believe.,"I purchased this app because I was fed up with paying the annual Intuit surcharge plus the inclusion of dodgy policing software.However much you dislike TurboTax at does manage to work most of the time unlike Taxcut. This looks and operates like an old DOS application running in a fixed Windows shell. I haven't seen anything so bad since the mid 90's. It also crashed a fair number of times under XP.Then there is the so called interview process which is about as user friendly as looking at the IRS guidelines. Half the forms that I required had to be downloaded and added in, an excruciating painful and slow process. And getting the depreciation process to work was close to brain surgery. In the end I was so confused by the collection of seemingly random forms required that I requested a refund and purchased TurboTax.Don't waste you time with this amateur offering resembling a real software product."
3,Can you fill out forms?,"I'm a multi-year Turbo user contemplating the switch bcs of the activation/spyware issue. I do a lot of work with guesstimates, and then need to go back piecemeal when the hard numbers accumulate--it's easier to just go straight to the forms, not thru a bunch of q&a that are no longer relevant.Can you mark as estimated in Taxcut?Can you work directly on forms?Can you override a connection? (sometimes it's the only way)Thanks."
1,Will not install.........,"For the 2002 version Intuit has put a program on the software which requires the user to ""verify"" the software. This Macrovision software is to prevent sharing of the software. I have no problem with that, if it would allow it to work on my computer!!!!Intuit does not have a fix at this time.........."
4,Goodbye TurboTax - Hello TaxCut,"I used TaxCut years ago and switched to TurboTax. After reading the Amazon.com reviews on both products, I am switching back - ESPECIALLY once I read on TaxCut's web page that TaxCut allows you to import from TurboTax. QUOTE: TaxCut allows you to import from last year's TurboTax and from the 2000 - 2003 versions of Microsoft Money and Quicken. :UNQUOTE. My mind is made up. I am switching back to TaxCut."
1,Jumping from the frying pan into the fire,"I have been a TurboTax user for years (and always liked it) but didn't but it this year due to the registration problems. I tried the switch and will never EVER use TaxCut again. With a cable modem, firewall, and antivirus software, I am completely unable to find a way to efile despite following any (useless and difficult to obtain) advice from TaxCut. Moreover, I took my file to another person's house with a dial-up and was still unable to e-file.If this wasn't enough, the program is inferior in just about every regard to Turbotax unless you are filing a very uncomplicated form. If you have your own business, do taxes for an elderly sick relative, or have any complicated issues (or if you want to e-file), avoid this software even if they give it to you for free."
2,Useless Customer Support,"~~~The tech support was useless. I called four times without my problems being solved. All four representatives that I talked with seemed not familiar with the product at all. Moreover, the tech support is not provided through a toll-free number. When I sent my questions through e-mail, the feedback that I got was just to uninstall and reinstall the application. It was not even for my specific questions.Furthermore, the software was not user-friendly when I intended to revise~~~~ information that I had inputted previously. Sometimes the system failed to reflect the changes that I had made.~~~"
2,"OK for Tax Prep, but Terrible for Updates and E-Filing","I bought TaxCut after hearing all the concerns about changes to TurboTax this year. This was a mistake. The TaxCut software is simply unable to cope with a home network and with a proxy server and a firewall. I had to perform updates manually by going to the TaxCut website, and when I had successfully finished my return, I simply could not e-file and had to file the slow and old-fashioned way -- with a paper return. I plan to go back to TurboTax next year! I never had such problems with TurboTax."
4,Good enough for me,"I've used TurboTax for 8 years but have switched to TaxCut this year due to the spyware and activation requirement in TT. (See reviews on TurboTax) I'm glad I'm using TaxCut. I've had no issues with it, its just as intuitive as TT (pun intended), and it costs less. My hard disk crashed big time yesterday and I decided to replace the PC. If I would have bought TT, I would have had to buy another copy just to get it installed on the replacement PC (or spend just as much on long distance calls to Intuit support). That's reverse software piracy. Not so with TaxCut, I had it re-installed and finished my taxes in no time. Buy TaxCut (or anything other than TurboTax) and save yourself some needless aggravation."
1,Do not use this software - it's a waste of money and time!,"I read the reviews of Turbo Tax this year, and since there were so many people disappointed with the product, I decided to try Tax Cut. What a mistake!! I've spent more time fixing the errors that this program created than all of the time that I've spent doing taxes using Turbo Tax in the last several years. It does not bring over all of the information when you import from last year's return. If you uncheck a question, it does not automatically uncheck the rest of the items that are related to the question. It does not give you all of the correct options that the forms have. If I had not been familiar with doing taxes and had no idea what my end result would be, I would have paid $$$ in taxes instead of getting the $$$$ refund that I was supposed to receive. The software is faulty and there are too many glitches in the program. I am throwing out this c.d. and will go back to my trusty and easy to use Turbo Tax!"
2,Wish we had gone with TurboTax,"This year we decided to go with TaxCut due to the security concerns of installing TurboTax - that was a mistake. Let me preface my review by saying that I have an IT background. I had trouble navigating through the steps and ensuring all the appropriate steps had been completed (when I actually filed, many checkboxes were still blank on the outline of steps to complete, but we felt confident the ones that were still blank did not apply - nevertheless it was very disconcerting). Navigation was also difficult when trying to find a specific form and the questions that populated that form.At one point, I found myself in an infinite loop & multiple copies of the same form were being developed. I called technical support (a number they make it very hard to find) & did get to speak with someone who helped me resolve the problem."
1,Better hope you don't need tech support!,"TaxCut provides support via a long-distance number (Dallas, TX) not an 800 number. Their tech support online is useless unless you just need some hand holding. They promise e-mail Tech support in 48 hrs, but my request took over a week to get a non-satisfactory reply. I wanted to return this for a refund, you'll also find they make that difficult.On a side note, if you were leaving TurboTax because of the spyware/spam associated with it, TaxCut may not be a good choice either. Read their privacy policy, they will sell your information to third parties."
3,Not as good as TurboTax but it did the job for me,"Like everyone else I switched from TurboTax because of all the negative comments. I had no trouble importing my TurboTax files. Then I simply followed the interview questions and before I knew it I was done. My taxes are not complicated at all so maybe everyone that is having problems is due to a more complex tax situation. But for a basic tax return TaxCut worked fine, but I still like TurboTax better so let's hope that Intuit listens to us for next year."
5,Happy with H&R Tax Program,"After many years using TurboTax (Intuit) I used H&R's TaxCut this year and found it every bit as good (and with less commercials).Why switch? Well, Intuit got greedy and wanted to install spyware on my PC to make sure I'm the only one that uses the software copy. While I understand their concern (same for all software developers), the approach was heavy handed and caused additional problems for the majority of honest users."
2,...programmers!,"...This program is buggy. If not because of the turbo tax bashing issues, I would have sticked with them.The numbers for the returns are off the display boxes. Then, if you want to mail the state form manually, the grid that has all your stock information DOES NOT get expand automatically to show the name of the company. Hence, I had to use a pen to rectify this problem. My suggestion is make sure you print out your tax forms and check them. Who knows what else is in there.Who knows what else is buggy in this software..."
3,Looks good on photo,"This backpack is pretty good. I bought it because it looked thin and simple. When it arrived the backpack was too wide for me. The shoulder straps were durable but looks-wise it was poorly designed. It didn't fit me very well. I'm about 5'5"" that's why it was too wide for me. When the designers designed this, I think they had it in mind for larger people.The pockets were great, the storage area for the mp3 player was well thought out and the covers were great. The colors were mediocre and the arm strap didn't fit well. This backpack was designed to look good while not being worn, for me the way my clothes and my accessories fit me is most important, followed by how it looks visually. I was disatisfied with the way this backpack fits.If you don't care about those factors, this backpack will work great to store your computer in and serve its function."
5,Doubled Fantasy!,"Unlike other Schubert works, these two pieces, ""Fantasie(D934)"" and ""Wandererfantasie (D760)"" are not composed from 4-movement layout. D934 is for solo piano, D760 is for violin and piano, and both have disturbing symphonic style. I love both of them. Andras Schiff's lyrical tenderness sounds rather good for me at this kind of poetic form. He and his wife Shiokawa conveyed the Schubert's intension vividly like impressionist painters. If you like Schubert, have this cd!"
5,Good quality product,"I bought this without the benefit of any reviews, so I thought I'd share one for future buyers. This product arrived promptly, shipped for free, and is of good quality. I installed the caps on the car, and each piece fit well."
5,The best DVD I own.,"This Rare 1980 tribute concert for Hank Williams hosted by his son Hank Williams Jr is a great addition for all you country music fans and Hank Williams fans. This dvd includes 20 songs song by Jim Owen who played Hank williams in the movie (his performances are from the movie he did of Hank Williams. Heres some of the artist you will see Hank Jr,Faron Young,Johnny Cash,Teresa Brewer,Brenda Lee,Little Jimmy Dickens,Roy Acuff,Waylon Jennings,Kris Kristofferson, just to name a few. This is a great collectors item and a investment because there's legends on here that have passed away including Minnie Pearl. You won't be dissapointment this is a extremely great DVD ever made. Buy it and you'll see. Enjoy"
2,Great firewall and antivirus; terrible parental control,"Great firewall and antivirus software. If you're buying this to use the parental control feature, however, don't. The lack of working URL updates for parental control makes that piece of the software useless. Symantec has known about the URL update problem since Sep and has yet to provide a solution."
1,BEWARE,"Not only is this horrible software, but it will destroy your ability to open your Email program. When you go to Norton / Symantec for help, you will learn that they have built a tremendous firewall around the company against its customers. Their technical support consists of a bunch of meaningless white papers. Call them, and you are told you will be paying $30 for the call. If you are willing to do this, you go thru many levels of questions, only to be told that this ""service"" is not available. I am extremely technically savy, but I can't get this to work. My ISP provider has no ideas either. There should be a big warning on this box that it will foul up your Email. BEWARE....buy this product at your own risk."
2,Read this if your computers are networked,"I received this product with my new Compaq computer which is a Pentium 4, 1G Ram, running Windows XP. At home, I have a central server which all my computers are networked to access files and the DSL modem. After I installed Norton Internet Security 2002, none of my computer could access the files on the server or see each other. I called support, and the only way each computer could share files was to take off all the security settings. This defeats one of the purpose of the software- internet security. As for the virus scan, everytime I tried to retrieve a file on another computer, ie file server, my computer would freeze. I uninstalled the program and everything was fine."
1,WHAT A NIGHTMARE! CAUSED US TO REINSTALL EVERYTHING!,"Guess how I spent SuperBowl Sunday!? In complete H*LL dealing with Norton Internet Security (NIS)! It'll be a long time before I ever buy anything from Norton again. You name, it happened. Spiked CPU usage, no more internet connection, IMPOSSIBLE to uninstall, WORST TECH SUPPORT PHONE MENU SYSTEM I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED, unqualified techs who gave up on us and yes, our only option now is to wipe the hard drive and start over. I'm a software engineer with 20 years of programming experience and am often asked by my friends for computer help. This is by far the worst experience I've had to deal with. Removing viruses and adware is easier than attempting to remove Norton Internet Security (NIS). I've wasted more time with NIS than I have with adware for the past 12 months! I'd rather leave my computer open to everyone on the net than try to install this software again. Okay, I'm done, but as you can tell, this software has caused us a lot of grief."
3,"Great firewall for a beginner, not enough for advanced user","I bought this firewall product on my DSL. It is not quite up to my expection, but it is still a good product.Pro:1. easy to set up and use2. the default setting can be strict, if you choose firewall setting ""block everthing unless specified""3. it provides both port filter and application filter.Con:Mostly for power users:1. the firewall rule is not flexible enough, and advanced setting is confusing. (compared to IPCHAINS in Linux, and Lock'nStop for windows)2. It CAN slow the performance quite a lot, especially when loading the firewall rules (I have about 30 rules). Taking minutes3. CANNOT differeciate between local net and extra net, which is a big fault. However, there is a Network Adapter option, which fits for this purpose. but i cannot get this to work..."
3,Can be hard to lasso down,"While I feel secure with this product and am thoroughly satisfied with the antivirus software, it has the annoying tendency to ignore the user's orders. Specifically, the software allows you to allow, deny, or automatically configure other programs on your computer which try to access the Internet. But after you provide a setting, weeks later it will ask you again whether to allow, deny, etc. as if the program is totally new and had no idea what settings you had put in previously. In the long run this becomes tedious and annoying. However, friends have had the same trouble with McAfee..."
2,Fatal Parental Control Flaw,"I use this product with Windows ME and XP. In many ways, it is a great product--if only it did not fail me in the one area for which I selected it--parental control. Much of the time, the Parental Control feature does not bar my children from visiting restricted web sites. Symantec admits on their support site that they are aware of the problem, but offers no substantive solution. That flaw is substantial to a home with children. For that critical reason, I don't recommend this product to families."
2,Great firewall and antivirus; Horrible parental control,"If you're purchasing this to use the parental control software, don't. Although Norton identified a problem with URL updates for the parental control list in September, they have yet to provide a fix. The antivirus and personal firewall software works like a charm. But Norton's support (they don't respond to email or letters) for users of the parental control software is nonexistent!"
2,Not Worth It,"Its good protection, but the program's a little bulky and excessive. The biggest problem: Subscriptions cost $$$ A YEAR!!! Now thats excessive. Might as well buy a new program every year. What happened to $ subscriptions? Its a RIP-OFF, don't bother."
4,Norton Products #1,"norton internet security is an excellent product it will offer toyou high protectionyou will find all the security tools firewall,add blocking,you canblock java,norton antivirus which all the world consider it #1antivirusalso you can protect your children from dangerus sites with partenal control but the partnal control will slowdown yourinternet connection specially if you use like me a dial-up modemand for this reason i give the product 4 stars instead of 5 starsyou can give norton internet security a try and i think youwill have a good software"
5,Excellent Antivirus Software,This software is the best around. With firewall and antivirus these two programs will stop a hacker and will never bother you again. I have been with Norton for about 4 years and I will not switch back to Mcaffee.
1,bad deal,I agree with the other one star reviews. I have been trying to update the last verison for weeks. I called customer service and was put on hold for 45 minets then a short session with an incompetant tech. then try something they suggest then call back on hold 1 hour 10 minets. On and on untill I wasted 8 hours trying to fix problem with update. Finally told that they would send new program. Three weeks later I am still waiting. No virus protection. Dont buy this program. It never found a virus. I dont think it did anything but interupt me whenever I tried to go to a new site telling me that the computer was trying to contact the web site. Well da. These people have made their web site purposely difficult to maneuver.
1,Completely hosed my system,"When upgrading my Dell Dimension 4100 from Win/Me to Win/XP via a scratch install, I was forced to upgrade my NAV license to NAV 2002 for XP support. I chose the NIS 2002 upgrade over the NAV 2002 upgrade because with the ... rebate, it was ... cheaper overall, with more ""function"".But it [messed] up my machine big time. It crippled my internet connection (cable) which worked just fine beforehand and the support options and solutions were pitiful.I finally got the thing completely de-installed (I hope!) and bought NAV 2002 instead. I prefer NAV over McAfee but will never buy another Symantec product again after this experience."
2,It works for newbies.,"It can be a great product because it combines antivirus and personal firewall in one suite; however, Norton Antivirus slows down computer a great deal, and requires buying the virus definition upgrade after one year of use. There are a few antivirus software that works better and cost much less: DrWeb, NOD32, Kaspersky AVI, Panda AntiVirus and etc. ""Tiny Firewall"" and ""Sygate Firewall"" are a free software, which in my opinion works better than Symantec."
1,WinFax Crash,"I'm only just evaluatingWinFax for my company, we have two PCs with modems, one in the office, one laptop for the boss to commute with. Both PCs use win2000 professional.So far we haven't been able to get it to work at all. On the desktop key features cause it to hang and be closed. On the laptop any attempt to initialize the software will cause bluescreen crash - and that's really unusual for win2000. Looks like we'll be waiting out another year and staying with tried and trusted win 98 software. until we're happy with further developments."
1,Save your money.,"Trying to use this product on XP is a waste of time/money. Tech Support is useless, as is online support.We have been using winfax for 9 years, but the product has only gotten worse(more complicated).Problems with 10.0 on XP include, word processors locking up, auto receive disabling after receiving 1 fax, lock up on send if using explorer at the same time."
1,Quite possibly the worst piece of software ever written,"I bought this software and installed it on one of my customers machines, I set up a special computer to be a ""fax server"" to recieve faxes and organize them into different folders, strangely the WinFax will randomly reject faxes, somedays it will refuse to work, somedays it will work great, somedays it will reject 50%, who knows what mood its in. I reformatted the computer so that the only thing installed is Win98 and WinFax, I replaced the modem TWICE, my customer moved to a new office in a different building with a completely different phone line and the product still doesn't work. Total garbage."
1,Don't buy Winfax,Absolutely useless. Causes word to lock. Will not uninstall. Symantec fixes don't work. Hours wasted. Don't buy this product.
2,Good for average user. Power user beware!,"Although I am working around the vast amount of bugs this program carries with it, it does deliver faxes ok. The client/server functionality sucks. The areacode rules are supposed to be set on the server however for some starnage reason they do not work. KB articles on symantecs site only confuse things. HORRIBLE support of this product. I am looking elsewhere for a solution."
1,Not too great with XP and Outlook,"Just bought the package to run under XP and using Outlook. It caused several crashes in XP and Outlook just quit. I used it under Win 2000 and it did well, but if you have XP, you may want to find another program."
1,Danger...Will Robinson....Danger,This program is great if that is all you need on your system. Do not expect Outlook to function PERIOD with Winfax 10 installed. It will lock it up like a conficted serial killer. The program itself is pretty functional despite a few operational bugs. But you just can have a program that doesn't play well with others no matter how nice its features.
1,Worst program I ever bought !,"This program is by far the worst I've ever purchased. It clearly does not install/work as advertised with Windows XP. Tech support couldn't help and in fact screwed up my registry while trying. Although Symantec agreed to refund my money (supposedly in 8 wks), they wanted to keep the $29.95 they charged me to talk to tech support. I argued that if the program worked as advertised, I wouldn't have needed their tech support -- and certainly shouldn't be out of $30 at the end of the day. I'm waiting to hear from the ""Consumer Relations"" department. No relief in sight for my damaged registry!!!"
1,WinFax Pro Awful in my computer,"I purchased WinFax Pro 10 from Symantec directly. I had had a WinFax program in one of my old computers (years ago). I don't remember the version number. So I thought that this new version has to be as good as my old one.I unfortunately downloaded the program after paying for it. My computer is now very slow, I have to keep doing ctrl, alt, del because the program and any other program on my desktop are unresponsive. This happened after I downloaded the WinFax Pro.I went back to the company because I somehow lost the exe file.You're not able to redownload your purchase. If you have not copied the program to disk or CD you're out of luck. I'm really sorry I bought it. The original product I had was wonderful.Symantec doesn't have any ""people skills""."
1,"Poor Product, Worse Support","I was forced to upgrade from v.8.0 when I upgraded my MS Office Suite. Now I have a fax program that hangs up when faxes come through, and sends duplicate copies of outgoing faxes (i.e., same fax to John Smith AND to Smith, John). Attempts to get help from the company or its website were futile. This product is the biggest piece of garbage I've come across in a long time.Kerry GleasonAdWorks"
1,This product will make you hate life,"Winfax Pro has caused me more headaches than any other single piece of software. It is buggy and slow and crashes at the drop of a hat. As far as I can tell, it is essentially unmaintained by Symantec; I don't think they actually plan on fixing any of the many major bugs, and are just milking this old, old codebase for as long as suckers continue to pay good money for it. Beware!"
1,the worst product ever made,"how a company can release a program that does not work is beyond me... it DOES NOT sync up with ACT! the way is it designed to do... I realize that ACT! changed their software, but that's no excuse... the program basically becomes worthless - why no updates? why no contact program? why no vision?"
1,AND it doesn't work for BROADBAND!!,"Total disappointment!I send lots of faxes as part of my job-seeking process, and when I read about this software I thought it would be particularly useful for saving paper and not using up the ink on my printer, not to mention that faxes get attention faster than an e-mail does, but I was totally disappointed that it DOESN'T work (symantec admitted so on their website, too!) with broadband internet connections. Are these people DELIBERATELY trying to make their products unusable or WHAT?!!"
1,Buggy is a huge Understatement!,"I upgraded to Ver.10.02 so I could use it with Win XP. What a mistake! Microsoft Word crashes on loadup, and Act freezes and won't close. As soon as I uninstall WinFax Pro 10, everything returns to normal. Good Riddence!Want Winfax for free? Get Norton Systemworks Pro Edition 2003. Winfax comes with it as one of many usefull utilities, and it dosen't cause any problems."
2,Get HylaFAX instead,"This product [is bad...I needed to send my resume by fax to a few places and my server is currently offline, so I tried WinFax. While the very basic things work, there are a lot of business features that just do not exists. Such as, what if you want to manually send your faxes and hold them in a queue until you are ready? There is no way to do this with this software.It looks like this product was released in 1999 or something. It is now 2002. No updates and no upgrade? Clearly this is not a product that is very interesting to Symantec. Then again, fax is a technology that is no longer necessary due to eMail."
1,Beware,Thsi will crash Outlook everytime you close Outlook. Period. Tech support is less than helpful despite the fact that they acknowledge it's a known problem.Please fix this and restore Symnatec's good name or retire this product.
1,Winfax trouble,"I have been using this product since winfax lite, (around 1995). Back then, windows was not as extensive and burdened with drivers and registry files. In theory, this is an excellent program, allowing an orderly record of all of your faxes ever sent. The unfortunate reality, is that this program will make your Windows PC behave as if it has a virus, and you will spend enormous amounts of time trying to find a virus and attempting to figure out why the system crashes whenever you try to do anything, most noteable, Microsft Word, and Dragon Naturally Speaking. Very few if any T/S people will be able to find a problem.Be prepared to spend lots of downtime and time problem solving if you put this program on a PC running windows."
1,"Horrible Program, Horrible Support","I bought this...thing.... loaded it up. tried to fax a Word document. There is no easy attachment icon, such as in Bitware.Then, when I tried to open a letter using Explorer, it wouldn't open my program! It read error in VBE6.dll, whatever the hell that means.So I went thru the maze of the Symantec support department...they wanted [$$] per instance for tech support.There are so many warnings and problems with this program, I deleted the damn thing. You are better off buying a fax machine. If you can return this piece of dreck, do it. If you can't, return their ""favor"" by writing a review.I am so angry!!!!!!"
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I got Version 10.03 for Windows ME.It wouldn't recognize my very popular 56K SupraMax fax/modem, and then it wouldn't uninstall. It's another piece of junk from our fine friends at Symantec."
1,Opps...retraction on that last recommendation,"The new Norton Systemworks Pro 2003 no longer includes Winfax. The previous version does, but it won't work with XP. Oh well..."
1,Terrible Program,"I have used this program and earlier versions for nearly 10 years. I wish I never had. The later versions of the program have many, many serious bugs regardless of the operating system. The most perplexing thing is that these bugs have been known to Symantec for 5 or more years and they don't even fix them! For example, I just lost 100's of sent fax records from the message store, and there is no way to recover them. This program may be OK for an occasional fax, but business users should never buy this piece of garbage."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"well i thought i had hit payday with this program, but its featurelessits good if u have very limited faxing, AND have a seperate phone line for just your computer, BUT also have cable mode/dsllet me explain why, whenever this program is on, its tieing up your phone line, so u cant use your dial up, so it needs its own phone line, i dont even know how a normal home user could use this programi have cable, so that isnt a problem, but only one phone line, so i got distinctive ring, and even tho winfax pro does have this feature, most computer modems do not, so either way it is not going to workfeatures on this are limited, and it can be a confuing program to deal with at times, and for the ... price tag it makes little sense t get when there are very nice printer/fax combos such as the HP V40SE, which i intend to buy ASAP"
1,Buyer beware!,"Could not get the software to work, no customer support line and of course no refunds. Tried Winfax's fax on demand to test software. Finally received the requested fax on the stand alone fax machine purchased THE FOLLOWING WEEK. What a waste!"
5,Totally pleased with Blue Air,I've owned the Blue Air 501 for 3 years and am totally pleased. I've tried others and I know that some are not worth trying (even though they are highly advertised and purchased). It's quiet and very effective.
4,be careful,"I purchased these filters with the understanding they had the black filter on one side, when in fact they did not. The picture used showed the black filter, but the product is different. I noticed they were 500/600 filters, not 501/601 filters...watch out if you need 501/601 filters!"
3,Why are they shrinking?,"First, the good - pricing was best after searching the internet. Now, the bad - Blueair seems to be cutting every corner it can think of. The surface area of the filter has been reduced so they colored the outside of the box black (previously it was white) so you don't notice that it no longer fills the entire screen of your Blueair unit. You can see that now 10% of the edges are cardboard and not filter. Secondly, at night I can now see light shining from inside the Blueair unit, meaning the filters are now thin enough to let light through where the old one were not. Sad that Blueair felt they had to go this route. I would rather they raise prices and keep a producing a quality product."
3,Different Filters,"As one other reviewer stated, there was no thin, black carbon filter on the outside of each filter as there was previously. I preferred the ones with the carbon because I would open the Blueair and vacuum them occasionally. Next time I'll order them directly from Blueair and see what I get."
5,excellent,I have been using blue air for several years. It really helps keep the dust and lint to a minimum.
5,Love My Blueair 500,Great deal on filters and fast ship too. Very satisfied. Have used other air cleaners but this one gives me really good allergy relief.
5,Filter Replacement,Nothing extraordinary or spectacular to pass on. I have been replacing the filters on our Blueair air cleaner at the recommended intervals. Routine maintenance activity.
3,Good filter/strange odor when new,"I've been using blueair 500/600 particle filters for 8-10 years. They do a very good job of trapping particles such as dust and cat dander. I had a friend who has severe cat allergy visit and he commented that my cat didn't bother him at all due to the filter. He was pleasantly surprised.However, the past two shipments from the company have had a strange, somewhat petro-chemical odor when I first put them in. I had forgotten about this until today when I put in the new filters. It does go away(or I get used to it?), but it's not very pleasant and certainly doesn't seem healthy. Has anyone else noticed this?"
3,"Good filters, but one was torn","These filters work fine for my air cleaner. I have terrible allergies and asthma, so the purifier really helps me. However, one of the set of 3 was torn. I didn't attempt to contact the seller, I just used them."
3,Sorry not to give it more stars,"Sir Thomas Allen is undoubtedly a fine singer and I appreciate his selection of songs here. However, I can only recommend this cd with reservations. It sounds as if the mix here is poor--that the piano stands out too much and that Sir Thomas Allen is standing too far away from the mike. I hesitate to say this, but wonder if only one mike was used, positioned so as to give the piano too loud a sound. The quality or technical aspects of the recording may also have been amiss. My point is that I want to hear the vocal nuances of this talented singer, but cannot make them out. It is too bad that all of the elements are here for a very enjoyable record--excellent pianist, good arranagement, and expert singer--but that the quality of the recording itself diminishes the total effect greatly."
5,Songs from an age gone by.,"My Father asked me to find him a CD with the song ""A Little Brown bird Singing"". I found it easily on Amazon on this CD. He was overjoyed to receive it. Played it through and said it brought tears to his eyes he enjoyed it so much. He is so pleased with it and has enjoyed every track."
3,Broken handle on #5558 shears,"Wusthof makes fine products but I noticed our 5558 shears have a broken handle. There is a clean break in the handle just below one of the gripping ""jaws"".....still usable but a strange thing to happen. Perhaps it's the result of a fault in the molding process when the plastic and steel are fused together. Local Williams Sonoma folks said to contact Wusthof and they could handle it. Hmm.....I was hoping the store would simply swap ours for a new one and let the Wusthof rep. take care of it at the store. She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed put the replacement project in my lap, so I'm on it! Oh well, life is full of hassles. At least I got some tasty samples at Williams Sonoma."
5,Just what I expected,"Seems to work very well. Good price, everything arrived on time, and and good condition. No complaints."
5,great kitchen shears,"Wonderful kitchen shears. They are very sharp and tight and, importantly, come apart with a simple twist for complete cleaning."
5,Kitchen Shears,It doesn't get any better! These are fabulous and that you can pull them apart to resharpen makes it a bonus! Great kitchen shears!
5,"best kitchen scissors; but, watch for RUST","These are essential shears. Scissors that do not come apart are not good for food; because, the food gets stuck and rots. These scissors come apart when you fully open them; and, they clean VERY easily. [...].Followup: After washing in dishwasher; these rust. I bought some kitchenaid scissors [...] for a tenth of the price that do not rust."
4,The blade.,"I like the way Wusthof knives cut; however be sure to note that these shears are only three inches blade. They don't open up well for cutting chicken. Otherwise, they are very good quality."
5,Good product,"Excellent quality, REALLY sharp!, and easy to clean. The take-apart feature also makes then easier to sharpen when needed. The handles are comfortable and well-shaped for both right- and left-handed users. Feels like they should last for years."
3,Wusthof 5558-1 Come-Apart Kitchen Shears,Really sharp shears . . . I mean really sharp. You need to be careful when you take them apart and when you wash them. They are perfect for cutting carne asada meat and for trimming the fat off of chicken. I love the ability to clean the shears are our old ones couldn't come apart and started rusting at the connection.I updated my review as the connection between the scissors are rusting and have no idea why that would happen if these are stainless steel . . . disappointed and am contacting the seller.
4,Quality Shears,"These are quality sheers. As others have mentioned, there isn't much room for your fingers. This makes them uncomfortable if using for a long time."
4,Kitchen Scissors,"We've wanted one of these kitchen shears for a long time and I finally broke down and bought one for my wife on Mother's Day this year. Needless to say, she keeps thanking me for such a useful gift. Guess I did okay this time!"
3,wusthof kitchen knife,"I would not buy this knife again. It does just what it says, comes apart even when you do notwant it to come apart."
3,Parents strongly cautioned,"These scissors are wonderful at what they're designed to do -- cut tough stuff. However, I'm afraid they are all too apt to cut tender things too -- like little hands. I don't understand why they are designed to come apart as readily as they do. They have often done this when I didn't mean them to. Children could do real harm to themselves or a sibling or playmate, if they got hold of these. My boys are grown, but if I had any little ones in my house, I'd have to lock these up like a loaded gun."
1,Won't Stay Together,"Upon opening the box, I immediately took these shears apart. Now I can't get them to stay together. However, this is no great loss since the handles feel cheap and uncomfortable to hold. I'm exchanging them for another pair of Henckels Twinshears -- my previous pair vanished."
5,"Clean cuts, not slippery when wet","- After 6 months of daily use, the shears are still sharp with no signs of rust or wear at the joint.- The textured handles provide a steady grip on messy items like raw poultry.- Clean up well in the sink or dishwasher; there are no creases or gaps for food to get trapped in.- Easy to assemble and break down."
3,OK shears--with an annoying issue.,"These scissors cut well enough, although they honestly are NOT the most comfortable kitchen shears I have ever used. The annoying thing is that there is a little button-bolt that holds the shears together, and even if I put the shears in the dishwasher without taking them apart, the button always pops off and I have to search for it. Also the blade length is quite short. I would not purchase these again."
3,Not the best wusthof scissors out there.,"These Wusthof Scissors are not the best scissors out on the market, they are just ok. The main problem I have with these scissors is that the two tabs on the handles of the scissors tend to pinch together and get stuck when using them. I have used better scissors at work I believe they are Henckels."
1,Nice to Look at,I just received these scissors. They are of high quality and made in Germany. There's only one problem. The handles are so small that I can only get two fingers into the handle. This makes it virtually impossible to actually USE the scissors. Maybe I'll hang them on the wall as art.
3,VERY Flimsy metal,"I was surprised by how flimsy the cutters and case are...the case has damage that went through to the largest cutter and as flimsy as the metal is, it will be very difficult not to bend it just opening it to remove the cutters.. They just are not as well made as I expected for Ateco."
1,"Made in China, not in Italy","Contrary to what it says in the description of the item (origin: Italy), the label on the cover says ""Made in China"". I wish it were not so."
3,"Good music, Bad singer!","While I agree with most of the other reviews on the musical side of this CD, the singer is horrible. He's the reason this band is overlooked. The song structures are solid with some fantastic leads and the overall sound is heavy enough. The music and lyrics have an epic feel to them which isn't bad but the vocals.... The vocals are too high pitched and don't fit with the music. As I listen to this CD I imagine Bruce Dickinson or Dio on vocals and what an improvement it would be. When the singer isn't involved the music is very enjoyable. Be wise and listen to some downloaded samples before shelling out any money."
1,CRUDDY CREATURE,10 REASONS I HATE THIS MOVIE:1 - Why do these movies always feature friends who don't really like each other?2- When did Devon Sawa gain so much weight?3. The CGI effects areawful.4. The plot makes little sense.5. The acting is terrible.6. The women scream too much.7. The directing is mediocre.8. It isn't scary.9. It isn't funny..just stupid.10. The ending doesn't make any sense.
1,SO BAD BUT ON PURPOSE.,"This movie is a joke. No one sets out to make a crappy movie-sometimes the best of intentions comes up crap. This movie was willfully made to look crappy. What do you know? They succeeded. It's crappy and just plain crap. A blatant low-rent rip-off of Predator, but the dred-locked creature in that movie was scary. This creature looks like a combination of Pirahnna, an old Ray Harryhausen stop-motion creation and any one of the weird Cantina characters from Star Wars. But this creature likes to disguise himself in a ""flasher"" raincoat and a wide-brimmed floppy hat. Scenes of it wandering through the woods looking like a homeless wino is the only reason I gave this movie a very generous one star.Since this movie is a rip-off of Predator, maybe Devon Sawa who plays the er-hmmm,""hero"", the producers may have suggested he bulk up.Hint for Devon Sawa----Arnold pumped iron--you scarfed down Big Macs. Not the same thing."
1,Abysmal,"I can enjoy ""B"" movies. However, this one, was a time killer and that is about it. Extemely bad acting, silly Predator rip off plot, awful effects. Pointless...unless you are desperate for very bad sci-fi/horror. Avoid this one unless you are a ""B"" movie fan."
1,BAD!!,"These ""knock offs RATHER SUCK!! The plastic on mine CRUMBLED!! The REAL BRAUN foil cover head does NOT FIT these copies,either!! SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET REAL BRAUN PARTS!!"
2,Broke after 4 months,"It worked for 4 months, then the brittle plastic at the base of each end snapped. I know Braun doesn't make them any more, so there aren't a lot of choices. Too bad, especially since they charge so much :-(."
1,poor quality,The plastic that holds the foil broke within 1 month under normal use. This was a waste of money. Save your money don't buy this product.
2,"Nice idea, but...","... tediously implemented. After the first dozen pages, you fairly much can predict the rest of the book. My copy ended up in the fire, I'm afraid."
4,"Opinionated, but insightful","Ms Walmsley clearly grinds her axe on both sides, but there's a lot of food for thought here, both as comparisons between the two English-speaking populations and as ""if the shoe fits"" mirrors"
3,"funny, but not a useful ""guide""","This book is funny -- it will provide laughs for the American expat or traveler who has spent a fair amount of time in Britain, who has seen the socks & sensible sandals combo, suffered through the self-deprecating humor, sipped a few too many sodas sans ice, watched sandwiches eaten with knife & fork, had ""puddings"" for dessert. Beyond the laugh factor, I'm not sure how useful it is. A casual traveler might be helped by the Brit-American dictionary in the front of the book (""chips = French fries, crisps = potato chips, biscuit = cookie, scone = biscuit,"" etc., but beyond that, I wouldn't rely on this as a ""survival guide."""
4,"funny, accurate, but dated","This book is a humorous and mostly accurate comparison and contrast of the British and American cultures. It explores a wide array of the facets of our cultures, showing that George Bernard Shaw was right on the money when he said that the British and the Americans were two peoples divided by a common language.The major problem with this book is that it is dated. A lot of references to the politics and pop culture of the Eighties, including Margaret Thatcher, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, the television shows ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" and their characters and stars.Other than this, a good book to have if you are interested in the cultural differences one finds across the Atlantic, but I'm not sure how reliable a cultural guide it would be if you were to travel today."
2,Good in its own time,"I recently moved to the UK and bought this book to ""prepare"" myself for the differences I knew I would experience. I found the book to be extremely out of date. For example, the book referenced the old American show Dynasty about 5 times. I showed it to a few of my British friends and we had a good laugh. Instead of sharing a laugh about our differences, we were laughing at the book. I'm sure it was good in the 80s."
1,Boring,"This book was horrible. It was long, drawn out and not at all entertaining. Don't buy it[...]!"
2,not that great,"this book actually has to stories in it, the first one, is just plain weird, and the second isn't much better. they're well written, i just didn't care for the plot lines."
4,Surprise! A good Movie,"I caught this flick on cable TV one day and was left feeling I watched a good-hearted romantic comedy. The movie wasn't the funniest or raunchiest and it wasn't a tear-jerker...just the way a romantic comedy should be. Robbins (the actor) was great in his ""working man"" role. The Einstein twist was marvelous and his (Einstein's) fellow genius' were also great.Strongly recommended for someone looking to watch a romantic comedy free of zany characters or crazy scenes."
3,I.Q. review,"The plot was a little shallow for our tastes. Maybe, with Einstein featured, we were expecting something a little more profound; some situation that better showcased his genius. Or, perhaps we were just in our 'somber mode' (mood?). We'll watch it again in a couple of months and try to get caught up in the comedy of the plot. Perry in Yuma"
3,eh????,"Good cast.... average topic, glad I didn't see it in the movies.... Take it or leave it..... Some fun parts in it , but script was weak to start with..."
3,It's Ok,I thought this movie is Ok. I thought it was weird with Albert Enistin being her uncle. And the story was a little weird. But becides that I thought it was ok.
1,"So so movie, at best.",Almost embarrassing at times. Still watchable for it relationship to historical events. I guess this means I have to use at least 20 non repeated words in this review. Done.
1,Dumb,I can't believe I'm the only person with a one star review this movie is so stupid. The romance is lame the supposedly wonderful car mecanic is so arrogant. Catherine may preach good ideas but she is such a hippocrite. Between dumb romance and stupid pseudo-intellectual talks about physics this movie willsurely drive you crazy.
5,"""I.Q."", on dvd","LOVED!!! LOVEDLOVEDLOVEDLOVED! Witty, charming, intellegent, sharp. Highly recommend, not only for adults, but younger people, too. You totally forget that it's Walter M. in the lead. Every character was well written, and well acted. Wish there were more flicks like this!"
4,IQ,"This product was a gift for my sister-in-law. I don't know if the DVD works, but the movie itself is a great chick-flick!"
1,Who is writing these positive reviews?,"Walter Matthau as Albert Einstein is quite a lot of fun.But the rest of the movie was just terrible. It was silly, predictable and dull. The jokes weren't funny. The script was terrible. We had five people watching. Three fell asleep on the couch and the other two (including me) kept forcing ourselves to watch hoping it would get better. Which it didn't.For Walter Matthau comic movies, consider Hopscotch or the Sunshine Boys! For serious movies with Matthau, check out Mirage, which is awesome."
4,A Family Film!,"A rarity! A family film! I was skeptical at first when friends urged us to borrow their DVD of ""IQ"". I am not at all a fan of either Walter Matthau, Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan. But the direction, cinematography, wardrobe (oh, her dresses!!!), casting and makeup made it all the perfect film for a light-hearted family movie night. We can't wait to show this to other families like ours who so often walk out of Blockbuster empty handed."
5,Adorable Movie,"Waa-Hooo! I love this movie. A mechanic tries to win the heart of Einstein's niece (meg ryan), with Einstein's help of course, by pretending to be a physicist with an amazing new idea. Funny and sweet. Totally clean too!"
3,A Not So Smart Comedy,"There are few sparks of life in this otherwise fairly lame and uninspired comedy. At this point in time, the only reason to devote 90 minutes of however much you have left of your lifespan is to see what Walter Mathau, Tim Robbins, and Meg Ryan looked like a LONG time ago. Meg Ryan, despite being a supposedly brilliant young woman, just CANNOT shake the dumb blonde persona long enough to become believable. She's cute as a button, though, isn't she? Tim and Walter.....it HAD to be one of those movies that you do just to earn a paycheck. They tried, but there's no making a silk purse out of this particular sow's ear."
3,adorable movie,A cute love story with delightful Meg Ryan and an unusual role for Tim Robbins. A very pleasant moment for the whole family.
3,"Weak, predictable comedy, but with some great actors!","I.Q. is a romantic comedy involving the niece (Meg Ryan) of Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) and a local mechanic (Tim Robbins). Einstein and his uber-high IQ buddies see something in the mechanic (or don't see it in the niece's fiancee (Stephen Fry)), and play matchmaker.There's a lot of Meg Ryan's famous smiles and pouting, and one really hilarious scene where the mechanic is taking a highly-publicized IQ test, with assistance from the ""gang of four.""Very predictable, but it had its moments. Expect a ""lite""-hearted comedy, and you won't be disappointed."
3,just average,"While I surfed the internet, I read about the street fury series so I decided to buy this dvd since it has a ""bikini and booty"" segment in Hawaii where I am from. It seemed rush, not enough time was spent on it. The entire dvd appeared to be made just for a quick buck. The women in that segment were beautiful, reminded me of how much I missed home. The interview with Flo Jalin was nice. My search for a good import dvd continues..."
1,Terrible coffee mug!,"I purchased this mug at Target: it leaks because of the poor lid closing piece, and it tips over too easily.They claim it has an 'anti-roll technology' but it is easily off-balance.If you have a choice, do not buy this and waste your money!Yes it seems to keep things warm or cool--but who cares when it doesn't stay upright or keep from spilling!!"
1,Terrible coffee mug!,"I purchased this mug at Target: it leaks because of the poor lid closing piece, and it tips over too easily.They claim it has an 'anti-roll technology' but it is easily off-balance.If you have a choice, do not buy this and waste your money!"
1,Don't waste your money,This mug does not keep coffee warm very long. One of the reasons is that it is plastic inside. The lid is hard to screw on and off.
3,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,Not too impressed on this one. It arrived broken at the lid area. I would never thread right. Amazon sent a replacement but I am not enthusastic on its shelf life. For the price I think I would have rather shopped around. But its currently functional and looks nice.
2,Top Heavy,I bought four of the Stanley Bolt Mugs for myself and the Guys that work with me in the office. I like the cup because if you follow the instructions it keeps the liquid hot or warm for a long time. This cup was designed for to use in a automible and not necerrary in a office environment. When I use it in the car it works perfict but when you put it on a flat surface it tends to want to tip over. I have not had this cup but for about a month and have spilled coffee on my desk twice since i have had it. This cup is top heavy and tilts very easy when it is full.
1,Product sucks from Stanley,"Most Stanley products that I have used have been reliable. This product has been a true disappointment. Even when preheated, my coffee does not remain hot and the lid leaks. No matter how many times you rescrew the lid, the threads on it dont seem to be compatible. Course, with the coffee losing heat, there is not a chance of getting burned, but the dribble down the chin look is no fun."
1,Waste of money,"1st time I put hot coffee in, the bottom cracked! It was replaced. Second time I used it, the top heavy clunker tipped over, spilling hot coffee on my lap and soaking my truck's seat. This with the lid in the closed position.Don't waste a penny on this ill-conceived piece of junk."
4,One of my favorite mugs!,"My wife and I have a large collection of coffee mugs 12+. Of these the Stanley Bolt is my personal favorite.Things that I Enjoy- Easy to hold - the metal looking handle feels sturdy in your hand- Holds a lot of coffee - 18 ounces is three cups!- The lid is convenient for opening and sipping your coffee.- The lid is unique looking - which makes searching for the ""correct"" lid much easier.Areas for Improvement-- The lid is a little too difficult to out on or take off.- Doesn't do a great job at keeping your coffee hot.- Does not have a rubber seal on the lids threads, so you have to keep your eye out for leaks.Final Verdict - One of my favorite mugs!4 stars"
4,Good Value,Aladdin a trusted name in hot/cold containers has a good product. Keeps liquids both hot and cold.
4,Great live band,One of the most enjoyable live shows ever. Always entertaining. The CD is great but you must see them live to appreciate them.
2,it will pump a tire up ! but pressure gauge has never worked from day 1 !,shipped quickly ! but thats the only good thing i have to say about it ! wiil pump a tire up but dont rely on pressure gauge cuz it doesnt work !!
4,The 14th edition of the quirky British film guide,"I have about five or six film and video guides I consistently use for reference, and the Time Out Film Guide is certainly one of the better ones and among the most interesting. I would not recommend it for someone just looking for one all-purpose guide because it's fairly quirky. It spotlights fairly obscure actors or films (and not always good ones either--they feel obligated to highlight interesting weak films as well as strong ones), and its biases can take some getting used to, especially if you're not from the UK. (The editors' marked prejudices and beliefs about Americans are often hilarious, and only sometimes intentionally.) But the reviews are written with intelligence and care, and are never bland, and the series of lists at the back of the book (filmographies for various important directors and actors, and lists of films grouped around key themes) are very handy."
2,Very small pictures,"This book is unusually small, the size of an index card (less then 4""x6"" in size). It is not a good value for the price. The picture are nice but small, and a too small to be enjoyed as a stained glass overlay of a window. Consider other options before buying a coloring book of this size."
5,southwest indian stain glass coloring book,"This book was just what I needed for my art prodject hat home, more than I was expecting"
1,these get rusty,"I am long time wustof user and have many sets of these. bought these and several cheaper sets. these are great knives but 3 times the cost of cheaper sets. nothing wrong with the knives but I now know what I pay for brand name.After washing these in dishwasher several times, I am getting rust on these knives. Since they are stainless, this amazed me. I found you have to prewash to get all the grease off or you will get rust. because of this I had to drop the rating to 1 star. Interestingly I have another full set of wustof on my butcher block. they do not get rusty so I think the metal quality in these cannot be as good as their other knifeware."
2,OK for steak,"They do cut steak, but are a problem with tomatoes and bread. I assumed that a sharp knife would also cut other things. My pocket knife cuts through tomato skins with ease, but not these."
4,Gourmet knives are stamped blades,In reading the comments on these knives I noticed that there was a different type of metal in the Gourmet vs the Classic. I checked my knives and then contacted a friend of mine that is into knives. He said that Molybdenum is put into the steel for forging purposes only thus it has no effect on the sharpness or finish. Because Gourmet is a stamped knife it does not require this type of material. I have the knives and they are great. They are not the quality of the Classic but they don't carry that price either.
3,Wusthof Gourmet Series Knives,"Just received these knives and they seem to be a fine set of steak knives. However, I noticed that these gourmet series (with the exception of the 8"" chef's knife), use different steel than their more expensive classic series. Specifically, the classic series uses ""X50CrMn15"" material, whereas these gourmet series uses ""X46Cr13"". The major difference being that X46Cr13 contains less carbon (0.5% vs. 0.46%) and that it does not contain Mn (molybdenum), which is needed for knives to be totally dishwasher safe. ..."
5,Great gift,"I was very happy with the knife set - as was the person who received them as a gift. They completed the knife block we had received for a previous gift, and are always impressed with the great quality. The knives were delivered quickly, especially considering it was around the holidays at which time they were ordered."
5,Very pleased,"When I want to give somebody a gift they wouldn't normally buy for themselves, I buy Wusthof. This is a great steak knife set."
2,Sony NS725P - a real disappointment!,"While this player looks good physically, has a nice remote, and some nice features like the DVD jacket display during stop mode - I found it has terrible 3:2 pulldown for film mode. I checked it using several movies: Monsters Inc. (which looked incredible), but films like Forrest Gump, Sweet Home Alabama, The Matrix, and Fellowship of the Ring looked so bad compared to my Toshiba SD-4700, I had to take the Sony back. The picture looked overprocessed with noticeable artifacts to the point I couldn't even watch it. Especially tried the lobby scene in the Matrix - all the marble made a dizzying effect of inaccuracies on the screen. I really liked the player overall, and the video mode looked great, but film mode was just too bad to bear. I'm going to try the Toshiba SD-3900 next, which should be comparable to my 4700. Wouldn't recommend this for a serious home theater lover."
1,Died abruptly,"I bought this player new about 18 months ago. It worked well up until last week, when it abruptly stopped reading all dvd's you place in it. Normal use, and a dvd player should last longer than that. I would advise against buying this player unless you plan to replace it within 2 years."
1,The NS725P is junk.,"After a few months, it starts to make noises and will say ""Cannot Play Disc"" on disks that play just fine in my other DVD player and on my desktop and laptop computers. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I would give it zero stars it I could."
1,beware of sony's customer service,"It is difficult to determine product preformance as product never functioned well from the box. Purchased early as a christmas gift outside the 90 day warranty. What a surprise christmas day when we were unable to view new dvds. Sony would not exchange and now we are stuck with a $149.00 paper weight. Buyer beware, it's better to procrastinate than buy early."
2,Sony doesn't stand for quality anymore,"I previously bought almost nothing but sony brands for all my electronics, but I think that is going to change. The price is usually higher than other brands with similar features, and I thought quality was worth it. I have gone through 2 DVD players in one year (both new out of the box) and was offered a refurbished one for $80. No thanks Sony, I'll try another brand."
1,run away from this one,Sony used to be all I would purchase for AV equipment but the quality in recent years has taken a nose dive.This DVD player lasted slightly over 1 year and just abruptly died. the DVPNS715P it replaced also died shortly after 1 year.Do an internet search for Sony DVD players and you will find hundreds of complaints of premature failures due to the low quality components Sony now uses in their products.This was the last Sony product I will ever purchase
3,Would have been better,"The cases came to me quickly, but when I opened it, I found that several cases were broken or cracked. Pretty sure this is a shipping problem. The cases themselves are constructed pretty well."
1,Very poor production,"After receiving this CD and listening to it in its entirety, I was very disappointed. The sound quality was severely lacking. The volume was inconsistent throughout the CD. Had this been properly mixed, I feel that this would have been a Wonderful CD!"
1,Piece of useless junk,I just received this item and I can't believe that I paid for this piece of junk. It is EXTEMELY flimsy and does not even stand up by itself. The fiberglass pole frame is to small to hold this up. This item did not come with guide lines and stakes which it MUST have to even stand up. Do not buy this item......
4,Watching Alone for Hundreds of Minutes,"Based on the director's earlier work, I was looking forward to Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles. And while I did enjoy it, I was also mildly disappointed. This film is visually very appealing, but I its central relationship between the father and the son was less than involving.Further, the characters seem to be playing ""types"" more than real people, so I suppose I could say that as a travelogue, this is first-rate, but as an engaging drama, it's less than successful."
4,general assesment,"The nuts and bolts of the subject were well covered. The illustrations were not to the standard I was expecting - this is after all a technical manual - and there were a surprising number of typographical errors. Should you want to modify,repair or just understand alternators then this book will do the job."
5,DVD of China Beach Please!,"This was the best of TV and my all time favorite. I would own it in a heartbeat if it were available. When I see some of the series out there that are now on DVD I am amazed that China Beach is not included. For my generation it is the memory of our men and women who gave so much for a mission that will always be in question. I am not alone in seeking to have this tape in my library and of course on my video screen.C Kugel Sorrento, Me."
1,Not the Vietnam I knew!,This tape (and the whole series) is nothing but a bunch of Hollywood blather. I spent a year hauling combat troops into battle. Never once did I see soldiers in muscle t-shirts with sweat rags tied around their heads. China Beach is more soap opera than reality.
4,A good start,"Not bad for a monopod, but legs could be secured better when stowed. It tends to rattle, so you'll have to use rubber bands to subdue the clunkiness. A shorter overall length, sturdier legs, and lighter weight would be ideal. Otherwise, a great device for not having to carry a much bulkier tripod. I highly recommend it if you're in the market for a high-end monopod."
1,bad tripod mode,"I tried both this Bogen 3231 and Trekpod Go. The Trekpod Go won out.- Inconvenient detachable legs: I have to remove/install everytime I want to convert to tripod/monopod mode. With trekpod, I can just collapse/expand the leg.- Unstable legs: The legs are so small -> very unstable. The Trekpod legs are much bigger and are built-in -> much more stable."
5,HAIL TRUE BLACK METAL......FROM THE US?!?!,"Good God!!! Great true, down and dirty black metal, and from the US none the less!!!! Each track is full of hate, and hatred is the main ingredient for great black metal! The drummer is also the vocalist, but you couldn't tell because the drumming is very hard and very tight, a rarity for someone that pulls double shift. An idea of how they sound is imagine old Mayhem with clearer production and much more louder!!!! A must for any black metal fan!!!"
2,Raw/chaotic BM...,"I have diff. view on this album after hearing it enough :If you haven't heard this album, then you're missing out on quite possibly one the most mediocre and non-interesting black metal album ever to be released here in the states. Finally after 2 demos and a 7"" - THORNSPAWN finally unleashes their debut album This is raw/chaotic BM, nothing more, and nothing less, 90% of the riffs are played over and over, and over but oh no, wait... not just any riffs, the riffs you hear on 90% of the other BM albums out there. So in otherwords, all the songs sound the same! The vocals are high-pitched, which are annoying. The production is, of course, raw! The overall sound to this is quite boring. Definitely one of the most overrated BM bands here in the states. Better representations of USBM : judas iscariot/weltmacht, cryptic winds, kult ov azazel, noctuary, and a few others."
1,NOT A MENORAH,"This Is Not a MENORAH, I am not jewish but bought it for my wife who is. The title say Menorah 7 branch> this is a fancy candle holder with some nice jewish symbols on it. I wanted to buy a Menorah for my wife , She said she likes it but told me it was not what i told her it was and that a true MENORAH has 9 place for the candles, Yes i know it says 7 branch but how is someone who is not jewish KNOW this when IT says MENORAH 7 branch They need to change the title of this item to candle holder 7 branch NOW i have to find a nice REAL menorah when i already spent 80 bucks on this ...thanks for misrepresenting wht the product is"
4,Magical Poem in Cage,"John Cage worked in collaboration with Margaret Leng Tan (toy pf.) for several times. Tan is so good and successful at expressing Cage's magical world. ""The Seasons"" was originaly piano solo number and translated into orchestra version here. Like Vivaldi's (or Piazzolla's) 'Four Seasons', the color of the music differ from piece to piece. It really excited my imagination. ""Concerto for Prepared Piano(1951)"" and ""Suite for Toy Piano (1948)"" (Tan's second recording) are not avant-garde anymore, they can come into center in classical music scene. ""Seventy-four"" (which Cage wrote for American Composer Orchestra in 1992) is rather new piece and anyone who loves Part, Gorecki or Tavener will love this."
4,Erector Set - Special Edition,"Erector Metal Construction Set (Styles may Vary)The set is the one shown in the picture. I was afraid it might not be, due to the disclaimer. The case is nice, a little leaky though. The steel girders have been updated since I was a kid. They are flat now and finished on both sides. The bolts are updated too; they are Allen-head(hex) bolts. The Allen wrench is included. The nuts are chrome finished and a few lock-nuts are included as well. I can't remember how the wheels used to be secured, but they are secured with little rubber rings now and don't work all that well. Most of the pulleys are plastic. The big pulley is metal and has a tiny Allen-head set screw with the smaller Allen wrench included. The instructions were enclosed and every part was there, with a few extra bolts and nuts thrown in for good measure. I'm happy with the kit, but its short on parts if you like to built from imagination. Another kit to throw in the case would definitely help."
3,Toys,I got this for the grand kids but it is not the quality of the old Erector sets. The metal parts are a little better than tin foil; I think. The packing leaves a lot to be desired. Parts are in bags that bang around in the box. But once out of the bag and the container is closed they come out of their slot areas. Great thoought but be aware that the quality is just not there. And this will be a short term gift compared to the durability of lego sets
3,Complex but well made.,"A bit complex for most 7 - 8 year olds, definately need assistance with an adult. If it's your first set I'd opt for a cheaper and less complex one."
5,Erector Lives!!!,I had an erector set as a kid. I thought Id buy this for my youngest son to see what would happen. He is ten. He loves it!!well made and everything was there.
2,Disappointed Nana,I was disappointed in this toy. I bought it for my 6 year old grandson and didn't even give it to him for Christmas. I was ashamed to give it. I looks like a piece of junk. It says 643 pcs but it looks more like 25. I just put it away and will give it to him some other time when a nice gift isn't expected. I would not buy anymore of these erector sets.. Disappointed Nana.
3,Erector Motorized Racing Car,"This was a Xmas present for my 11 yr old grandson. He loves the toy, but pieces keep breaking. The good thing is you can purchase replacement pieces. He is getting many hours of fun with this toy."
5,Good pick for my 8 year old's birthday,"My son loves robots, cars, and legos, so I figured this would be a good choice for a birthday present this year.I had picked up this kit, as well as the little powered tool for Erector sets, and my son loved them both.He's still a little wary and needs to build up some confidence with this, since it's more complex to do than Legos are, but he loves that he can pick from a bunch of things to build, and that there are so many options that appeal to him.It's a good step from the legos, since he's got to work so carefully with his hands now with the assembly, it'll help improve his coordination, and the complexity will definitely help him get to the next level of following instructions.Some of the pieces are plastic, but that doesn't seem to be imposing any issues for us.All in all, a nice set with a lot of options to give him a new way to play. And he's already looking at just making his own random creations, so I'm curious to see what his imagination can create."
4,Race car Erector set review,"I bought this Erector set because I saw my 6-year old son enjoying tinkering with nuts and bolts and building parts on his own. This set is great, but very complex. Overall my son and I have enjoyed working on the different models it can make -- it truly does build out at least 8-9 different items. The only thing disappointing about this set is the electric motor is far under powered to make the heavier items run. I first built the Race Car, and the motor could not come close to powering it at all. Nevertheless, it is serving as the building toy I wanted for my son and I. I still highly recommend it for parents with a lot of patience and children with a solid attention span. The included instructions are perfectly clear, but they are quite complex."
5,Still an awesome toy,"If you're reading this, odds are you grew up playing with an Erector set and you're now considering one for your child. The good news is they're still just as cool as they were when you had one. The materials have actually been improved. The straight peices are now completely flat, rather than the beveled sides they used to ship in the old sets. They're made of a more rigid metal as well. This allows for a little more flexability in what your kids can design and build. At first I thought the price was a little steep, but my 8 year old has easily gotten $100 worth of enjoyment out of this set. I actually ended up buying another set to ship to a relative for his upcoming birthday, so yes, you're getting what you pay for."
5,Unleash your creativity,My 17 year old LOVES this set. In the first week he made a working crane and then built a truck to set the crane on. He was able to follow the directions easily. Then he was able to quickly figure out ways to build his own creations. Well worth the money.
3,overpriced,I found the Erector Motorized Racing Car & More - 643 pc for $50 at Target. It is the identical item. I was very surprised that Amazon was so much more. I ended up returning it. Check your local store before paying more than $50 for this item.
2,Bad electric switch,The electric motor has a switch for forward/backward moving.The switch works only one way!?I show this rate bacause the Erector Motorized Racing CarConstruction Set may be used but without of all functionx.
3,follow age requirements,"I bought this for my 9-year old son who loves building with Legos. I thought he would enjoy this set and could handle putting it together. Ooops. I was wrong. It's a little too advanced for him. His Dad ends up doing most of it. It requires a great attention to detail, which my son does not have at this age. Hopefully he will like it more as he gets older."
3,Erector Motorized racing car,"This was a present for my grandson. Although he is eight, he understood the instructions. Although it needed more designs to make. Also not enough screws and longer pieces."
5,Every Child Should Have One!!,In a world of electronics....I bought this for my grandson (9) for Christmas. He actually requested it!!!! I am so happy that toys like this are still available. I find that it motivates so many areas in the brain for thought and physical process. He will spend hours and days working on his many creations. Thanks again for great service.
5,2nd Childhood,"The Special Edition Set having 643 parts provides hours of enjoyment, however, I wish I would have counted all of the parts when I first opened the package. I contacted Meccano and notified them that I was missing several parts. I never received a replay from them. I had to purchase the (British made) parts from California and I should receive them shortly. It is a very dissappointing Customer Service Program."
5,Great Educational and Fun toy.,"This erector set and others like it are great for dads and kids to complete building projects together while developing useful educational skills and stimulating imagination in young minds, hours of fun for kids of all ages. The instruction manual was easy to follow and the parts are of high quality, all in a well organized and divided hard plastic carry case for easy storage."
4,"Good for the price, can't tell difference.","I bought this cable to run from my computer video card to an A/V switch, which connects to an older CRT TV. It sends the signal over just fine. I hooked a shorter 6' gold-plated S-video cable just to compare, and I really can't tell much of a difference. I have heard that the signal for S-Video can degrade due to cable material and cable length/distance. I can't tell the difference, but maybe the TV is so old that it has limited image quality. In my particular case I needed the 12' distance, and for $7, it's a good deal."
3,Does Its' Job,"There isn't a lot to say about a cable. I found this particular one on Amazon; it wasn't the cheapest, but it was from a company I recognized and trusted. It arrived as expected, and has worked beautifully ever since."
1,Too good can sometimes be a bad thing,"This video cable is too good for its own good. The picture is soo digital you can see the pixels in the screen when you are watching a DVD. Quite annoying actually, cause everything looks like it is coming off a low quality computer, or like it was stretched from a small screen to a big screen and the # of pixels that make up the picture stayed the same.*Do Not recommend* I actually put my A/B video connection back into the TV and the picture is much better. more real less computer graphic looking."
2,cheaply made,I was so disappointed at the new Stanley thermos. I could not believe how cheaply made it is. The cap is hard to screw on tightly and it feels like it is made of aluminum (thought it's not). I guess I was expecting a well made Stanley like my father used to have. Another American icon bites the dust!! So sad. I would not recommend this product at all.
1,MADE IN CHINA,"This is the fourth or fifth Stanley thermos I have owned over the last thirty years. This is also the first one made in China. The spot weld on the handle bracket to the body broke within the first week. Being an enterprising American, I simply put an American made large hose clamp around the bottle and clamped the broken junk to the bottle. I am sure this will be the last Stanley thermos this customer will ever buy, and I'm also sure Stanley really doesn't give a damn. They know exactly the type of blue collar Americans that have always purchased their products and Stanley consciously made the decision to export the jobs anyway."
1,Not Worth the Money,"These are not like the original from before. They are not manufactured as a heavy duty thermos. Last year I bought my boyfriend one that was very heavy duty and has a smooth interior. These are 30% lighter and you can see every weld inside the bottle. The quality is much worse. I ended up returning two from here and Walmart because the photo is showing the original heavy thermos, not the one that comes with a label and a 30% lighter tag."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this as a gift for my husband thinking it would be the same quality as the one I had. It is very lightweight and says ""Made in China"" on the bottom. Apparently, the Stanley company was bought out by a manufacturer in China and the quality has taken a noticeable dive. Other than that, id does maintain heat for a decent amount of time and works well for my husbands coffee. (He drinks it fairly quickly, so not sure on the total ""heat time"" on it)"
5,Better Than The Older Stanley's,"I read some reviews that criticize this new imported Stanley Classic for not having the quality of the older Stanley thermoses that were once made in America. Unfortunately for the ""Made in America"" shopper, nothing could be further from the truth. I purchased my first Aladdin Stanley thermos back in 1984. The only part of that unit that was constructed of quality stainless was the interior. The exterior, including the cap, was comprised of some type of lower grade metal, as was easily verified with a common magnet. The bottom would leave a rust stain anywhere you sat it, including the kitchen countertop. However, the newer Stanley Classics are built of stainless steel, inside and out. No rusting! There has also been a noticeable improvement in thermal properties, as my coffee stays hot all day long."
1,Not your fathers stanley thermos,"25 years ago serving in the military this was the holy grail of thermos bottles. 36 hours and you could still burn your lips. Told my wife the war stories and bought her one. What a sad testament to Stanley. The lower grade stainless steel and poor craftsmanship might give you 4-5 hours, if you pre heat. Stanley profits are probably up but the quality is sure down!"
3,Cheaper at Walmart,Walmart has this exact thermos for $20.00Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
1,Another great American brand down the drain,"Broken weld at the handle bracket. Less than two weeks old. This is the third Stanley bottle I've had in my lifetime, the other two were lost and stolen, not BROKEN. They picked the wrong Chinese vendor. Don't waste your 30 dollars."
5,Best ever I had,I want to buy something to keep hot water over 15 hours and the container is not plastic . It is the one able keep hot over night even longer. This is what I expect it.
1,What a disappointment!!!,"I have one of the older, silver Stanley thermos's that I've had for years. I like to make a pot of coffee at night, throw it in the thermos, and its still hot in the morning.Thought I'd try a new one. COMPLETE CHEAP JUNK!!!You can tell just by the weight. My older, well made thermos feels like it weighs about 5 pound heavier than this.You won't believe this, but I actually just threw the new thermos in the garbage, and cleaned my old thermos with some baking soda.I tried keeping a pot of coffee hot overnight in this thermos. Ice Cold in the morning!! Plus the cheap little cap cup was crushed when it arrived. wouldn't even sit flat.Remeber when we used to make stuff worth buying that would last forever. Man I miss that stuff. You can have this junk."
3,Looks great - that's about all....,"This is a classic looking vacuum bottle. However even when preheated and filled with hot coffee it only holds the temp for about two hours max. It seems pretty tough and fairly well constructed, but the whole point of the thing is that it holds a temperature. I've got an older Aladdin that does a much better job, and it's the exact same size and shape.I like to brew a large pot of french press coffee and keep the leftovers in a thermos so I can have hot coffee without having to reheat it. I really want to like this as it has the classic Stanley look to it, but it falls short in performance. I'd be perfectly willing to pay more for a USA made produce with better performance. I am now looking elsewhere since Stanley does not make any such product."
2,Damaged and disappointed,"This thermos arrived quickly, but had a dent on the cap. It had only two pieces of flimsy paper around the thermos.This thermos is not like the old heavy one from the past. I hope it at least last a year or two keeping liquids warm. I'm not a happy customer on this one."
3,No longer has a vacuum,Purchased this about 6 months ago. Just noticed last week it was very warm to the touch and sure enough 30 minutes later the coffee was room temp. Wasn't dropped or abused in any way. Replacement is on its way from stanley. We'll see how it holds up. I see others have had similar problems...im guessing Chinese MFG quality may have something to do with it.
2,Not happy with this purchase,Bought this from local store two years ago and today it no longer keeps any liquid hot....so much for the idea that it will last a lifetime. Not a cheap item to have last less than two years.Will look for alternative quality item to replace it.
2,"Classic design, but not a great performer","I bought one of these to hold soup for my lunch and occasionally do some thermos cooking. While I'm a big fan of the product design, the thermos just does *not* keep things hot if you don't fill the entire capacity. I usually heat up a can's worth of soup to near boiling in the morning and pour it in the thermos, taking up probably half the total volume. By lunch my soup is no more than lukewarm.I plan on trying a different brand of thermos in the future."
2,Not Your Father's American Stanley Unit,"This unit is made in China and the only thing in common with the previously American made unit is the enormously high price tag.My unit started leaking under the cap about one month after I purchased it. I bought a new cap only to find that it was a manufacture defect in the sealing area of the unit. This was nursed along by over tightening the cap until it eventually slipped a thread. After that I got into the habit of turning the unit upside down (allowing the unit to leak into the cap/cup) before opening it.Soon after this, the spot weld area for the handle gave way. Welded in three spots, two of which clearly have paint on the originally intended upon welding surface.Tonight the thing leaked all over my wife's lap as she merely intended to open it and that was the last straw. This thing is a TURD!The only reason I did not give it one star is because it does have good thermal qualities."
1,"Durable Bottle, Famous Name, But Will Not Keep Coffee Hot!!","I am a locomotive engineer and I drink an average of two quarts of coffee a day while I'm on the job. I need a vacuum bottle that is durable, and that will easily fit into my grip. This bottle fills the bill in that department, but after a couple of months, this bottle has started losing it's heat retaining capabilities. I took it out of my grip (bag) the other day, and the whole outside of the bottle was very warm. The coffee inside was lukewarm, and I did the preheating stuff beforehand. This is my fourth Stanley bottle, and I will NEVER buy one of these again. They all start out great, and get worse as you use them. I have since ordered a Thermos/Nissan Work Series Thermos Beverage Bottle - (40 oz.). These are hands down better than anything Stanley makes. I got mine from [...]. The Stanley bottle has great potential, but the company needs to figure out how to insulate it!!"
3,Good...but you can do better,"I filled a brand new Stanley Vacuum Bottle (1.1 liter) and a brand new Thermos Work Bottle (1.25 liter) each with boiling water and let both stand side-by-side in a 67-degree, climate-controlled room for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the water in the Stanley Vacuum bottle measured 144 degrees. Not bad. But the water in the Thermos Work Bottle measured a whopping 162 degrees after 24 hours! Needless, to say, the latter gets ahigher recommendation."
1,Save your money: Stanley USED to make a good Thermos,"Fact: Stanley Thermos USED to make a good product.Fact: Stanley Thermos does NOT make a quality product anymore.Here is a review for you. Yesterday I did a side by side comparison of two Stanley Thermoses. One was purchased 20 years ago, and one purchased last year.The Thermoses were filled with the same coffee batch at the same time (5:00 am). At exactly 12:00 pm we opened the thermoses. The one purchased 20 years ago contained piping hot, steaming coffee. The one purchased last year contained cold, not luke warm but cold, coffee.If you would like a durable product that will last forever that is one thing. If it needs to keep a beverage hot then spend your money elsewhere. A styrofoam cup can keep a beverage hotter than a Stanley Thermos and it doesn't cost 20 bucks.There is a REAL review."
1,Not so Hot,"I bought this product based on the Stanley name, and the previous reviews on Amazon. I use it to take coffee to work, and was hoping to have hot coffee all day long, based on the previous Amazon reviews. Unfortunately, coffee that is boiling hot at 6am when I leave for work is lukewarm by noon. That's not anywhere near the performance that was boasted about in previous reviews. I guess Stanley tools are better than their thermos bottles."
1,Defective on arrival,"The 2Q Stanley thermos we received was a total let down. I have always heard good things about Stanley thermoses and now I know that the things I heard were about them were really about ""Aladdin"" Stanley thermoses (the ones that were made in the USA). After receiving ours and trying it out, we found that the exterior immediately heats up beyond what is comfortable to touch and leaves you with cold coffee within 2 hours. At first I thought we got unlucky and that we should try getting another one, but after reading reviews I have noticed that these thermoses aren't what they used to be.It seems when Aladdin Stanley was sold and manufacturing went to China that quality control really took a dive. Unfortunately I get the idea, from reviews, that 25-33% of these are defective and that the rest work fine. I think I'll buy an Aladdin Stanley from eBay."
2,Not made in the U.S.,I have owned this thermos for less than a year now. It is great as far as keeping my coffee hot for almost a solid 14 hours but the cheesy spot welds that hold the handle on came apart. Until I decide whether or not I will get a new one the handle is held in place with duct tape.
1,Doesn't work and will cost me $20 to return,Bought this because they were advertising the model that Stanley says will keep hot beverages hot for 24 hours. Wouldn't even keep coffee WARM for 2 hours. Total rip off..... Altrec said it was a warranty problem? It was brand new supposeable. You know the story. Last purchase for me. I'll stick to local stores.
4,Old vs new,Got this for christmas to replace my 25 year old indentical unit. The old one is USA and the new is China. No surprise there. It is thinner and more cheaply made and also doesn't have the pour through lid. It does have a wider neck for easier cleaning though and when I did a test comparing my old one the new one actually keep hot coffee hotter overnight by a few degrees. So even though my old heavy duty original is made in USA I have to give the new model 4 stars due to the slightly better performance and wide neck. Had to take one away though for the loss of my pour through spout which I will miss.
3,Plastic stopper broke when dropped - $15 to replace,"Bought this for my husband (to replace a very old Stanley thermos). Would have given it 5 stars based on initial use. Keeps coffee very hot and my husband liked the wider neck/stopper than his old one and you can pour without removing it. He wanted another Stanley because they're supposedly ""indestructable."" He dropped it after a few months and the stopper broke, plastic casing fell apart revealing stryofoam. No longer keeps contents hot properly. We were expecting the replacement stopper to be a few dollars, wrong, $15 (half the cost of a new thermos). So much for indestructable!"
1,Great for 2 months,Bought the 1.1 quart around two months ago. It worked perfectly then all of a sudden it stopped insulating. I cannot figure it out. It was never dropped and it was gently hand washed. I have the 2 quart version that was given to me as a gift 15 years ago and it is still going strong. I am very disappointed because I love this size thermos. Please Stanley bring back the quality control.Stanley Classic Stainless Steel Vacuum Bottle
1,not as said so,"As others stated, '''purchased this item after'reading reviews on this site but found later this is not so good as said. 100oC water filled in @ 9am became ~10oC overnight, a 90oC drop without opening the plug in the middle. If you use this for keeping temp at 60oC (from 100oC) in 6 hours, I bet it works for that but don't expect for more than that."
1,Stanley Lies!,"I purchased a Stanley Thermos that was clearly labelled, ""Lifetime Warranty"", so when it stopped keeping beverages hot I called their customer service number and was told that in spite of how the product was labelled it is their policy to not replace older products. They said that the product failure is the result of wear and tear, in spite of the fact I have taken excellent care of it and it looks like it just came out of the box! It has never been dropped, dinged or used in any unusual manner. The customer service rep said ""lifetime"" is not the customer's lifetime but the product's lifetime and their policy is that older products are not covered since their lifetime has expired. I don't buy products from companies that lie and I hate dealing with representatives who can only keep restating ""policy"" versus truth in advertising. I used to give these Thermoses as gifts - no more, I have bought my last product from Stanley."
4,Good quality. Do what it claims. But pricy.,"This bottle is a little pricy. But it does what it claims. It preserves hot water temperature very well. I didn't try the cold temperature. The construction is very solid for high impact resistent (good for portability). I have no doubt that it will last for many many years. In all, I am happy with the quality of this bottle. But, I will take 1 star out due to its premium price."
1,Stanley Quart Bottle,"Don't waste your money on Stanley -- inferior products, zero customer service. Got this as gift from son after losing original on fishing trip. Loses heat a lot faster than the original, only keeps coffee hot for 3-4 hours at most. Old bottle kept it hot all day. From day one it leaked, started with just a couple drops progressed to steady, slow seeping after ~year. Contacted Stanley, said they'd send me a replacement cap & seal. Didn't get it, contacted Stanley again ~3 months later, said sorry, would send replacement cap & seal. Didn't get it, contacted 3d time, no apology this time, said they'd send replacement cap & seal. Never got it. Won't ever buy a Stanley product again."
3,satisfactory,the item was not as heavy duty as I expected from a Stanley product. the item arrived dented not in perfect condition
2,Get the Aladdin/Stanley Thermos,"I bought this thermos about two years ago, and immediately, I discovered that the cup came apart -the stainless steel came off the plastic. After about six months the thermos wouldn't keep my coffee hot. It will keep the coffee warm for an hour, maybe. I've already ordered the Aladdin/Stanely thermos and plan to throw this in the garbage."
1,Don't waste your money on this product.,I bought one of these about 15 years ago. It keeps coffee hot enough to drink for maybe 2 hours if you preheat the bottle before filling. A better choice is the Thermos Work Series 1.25 QT. It keeps coffee very hot and drinkable ALL DAY LONG.
1,Bottle is junk,"This is the second Stanley that I have had in about two years. I use it every day for coffee. The steel on the inside of the bottle has craked and pieces of rubber like insulation are coming out. This is the same thing that happened with the first bottle. Made in China junk, pure and simple, never again."
5,Lives up to expectations,"We purchased this one to replace one that was about 30 years old. Was hoping it was as good as the original, and it is! It keeps coffee hot to the last cup. The handle on the side makes for easy handling and pouring. Does not need to be "" new and improved"" because the original is fantastic. Is large enough to hold coffee for the whole day, not just a cup or two for a commute."
1,Been bad for a long time,"Back in 96, I used the green stainless steel Stanley 1 qt. bottle since my dad used them. Even back then, my coffee became cold in a few hours. Recently, I started working overnights again. I bought another green stainless steel Stanley 1 qt. bottle, which was worse then the first.Not sure about all these 4-5 star reviews.Get a Thermos Work Series 1.25-qt. BottleWork Series 1.25-qt. BottleYou will thank me."
5,Stanley 2 Quart Vaccum Bottle,"This is a lifetime investment. The Stanley Vacuum Bottle is rugged and will withstand falls, drops, etc. Our 1 quart bottle is still going after 20 years of service. The container keeps hot liquids hot for hours. A GREAT BUY!"
1,"Keeps coffee hot, but the lid design sucks.","I hate the new lid design! Every time I pour coffee, it drips and spills onto my desk and runs down the outside of the bottle. So I have to ""wipe-up"" afterwards. It's really annoying. I miss the ""pour through"" lid immensely. Also, I use the ""cap"", which is not insulated, as a cup, so the hot (very hot, I might add) cap doesn't lend itself well to being used as a cup. Cheap, crappy design. I'm looking for something else."
2,"Do not buy this item, quality is low","I purchased this item in 2008. Now three years past, I think I have enough experience with this item for a review.First, it does not do a good job on keeping water warm long enough. This is due to its design. It has a steel inner shell, which itself is highly heat conducive. You can clearly feel the ""mouth part"" of the item hot or warm. This rapidly dissipates heat.Second, its build quality of low. The handle on my bottle broke from the body because the weld spot gave up. I have to use some steel wire to temporarily hook the handle to the body. Nevertheless to say, this is not neat and not so safe. I might have to throw this thing soon."
1,Big disappointment. Does NOT keep liquids hot.,"I can't remember giving a product one star before. If you put boiling hot coffee inside, them you might have luke warm coffee at best in one hour. It has disappointed us on two road trips where we thought we would be drinking hot coffee. The older Stanley thermoses worked great but these I believe are made in China and the company really is not trying to satisfy it's customers, according to all of the bad reviews on Google. This one is going back to the store."
1,"Very Unhappy, does not keep beverage hot for long",Large Size. I was hopeful. The outside of the bottle gets warm. I think that's because the heat in the beverage is passing through. After two attempts (long drives) to enjoy this bottle I finally gave it to Salvation Army.
4,"Good product, Bad packaging.","The product arrived on time and works as promised.However, it arrived damaged ( slight dent on bottom and cup )due to the way it was packaged.Thermos was on one side of box, with the ""protective packing"" all on the other side. The box arrived busted open( of corse on the thermos side )and taped back together."
3,Stanley Thermos,"We had purchased Stanley products before with no problem. But not this time. My husband had only used for a week when the handle came off from the one end. He put it back on but it came off again. He continued to put it back on, but it came off again. I sent an e-mail to the company but it's been about a month & I still haven't heard anything.It does keep his coffee hot for the eight hours he's at work, but it's inconvenient to carry without a handle."
4,Good value for your money,Stanley continues to produce a superior product. I had one years ago and unfortunately was lost.It never disappointed me.
4,Long trips,"I got this for my husband to replace the one he had. He had had it for years and it still looked new and worked great until he lost the top. I got an even larger size, thinking the bigger the better, he liked the next size down. He said it was easier to pour but, it still keeps his coffee piping hot hours and hours after he filled it."
4,Good product,"Fabric strength is sufficient (does not tear easily) and it appears to be good for its intended function, i.e. wrapping around perforated drain pipes to prevent silt from seeping in and plugging the pipes. I did not award 5 stars because I would have used a wider roll (6 ft would have been ideal) if it had been available. I buried the pipes in crushed stone and wrapped the fabric around the outside of the stone layer to allow for better drainage. At 24"" the fabric was not wide enough and so I had to overlap 3 runs for complete coverage. Other than that, very happy with the results. Drain worked great during last rain storm."
5,Getz Live and Lovely,"Recorded live at the Cafe Montmartre in Copenhagen on July 6, 1987, this CD conveys the spontaneity that one can really only find in a live performance. This is good Getz, with the other memebers of the quartet contributing good support and good solo work."
4,Mix was Hype,"Yes, I know the looks of the cover my not be what some of us would call proper, but the joints on this cd were popin'. Every cut on this album makes you want to get up and move your body. It will make you feel like you're in the club if your not. So yes if you like shakin' that thang and you wit the hype bass drivin' music this is defintely the c.d. to buy, and don't hesitate."
1,No Excuse for the poorly designed network configuration and pairing paradigm,"Canon is a great camera company. I have had all of the 1Ds versions and many of the small Power Shots. I have eight computers on a LAN with several video cameras and a NAS which I have set up and configured without any problems but the setup for this thing is a confusing and ambiguous pain in the neck and in this day and age it should be simple, painless and highly reliable; actually, it should set itself up with a minimum of input from the user; just like Apple's computers and other network equipment.And once you set it up it is very, very, very slow with raw files even if you have a fast network.As one of the other reviewers wisely said, be sure that you know that you really need this device before you buy it. If you don't have a pretty compelling wireless requirement you are just not going to use it."
2,Socks look and feel cheap,These socks are very thin and have a wide wale rather than the narrow wale as shown in the product description. Fabric feels rough and the non-binding top doesn't look like it will keep the sock up at all. I would not buy again from this vendor.
4,Decent socks.,I get rashes when I wear synthetic materials so it is VERY hard for me to find socks that I can wear. I can wear these. I bought these on amazon and I saved money by buying several pair at once.
3,cotton lisle non-binding socks,"My late husband liked these a lot, but his ankles were swollen from chemo. The non-binding cuff on these cut off circulation in his feet and he couldn't wear them for long at the time. They would probably be better for someone who needs more of a support-type sock; they are sure NOT very non-binding."
3,Just OK.,"Yes these socks are 100% cotton. Yes, they're cheap. Yes, they're just OK. Very thin. Not ""crew"" socks by any means, and they're not advertised as athletic socks. I just didn't want polyester or any other synthetics. I hoped they'd be thicker, but I'm not shocked that they're not."
2,Socks too thin for my preference,They are too thin and feel like nylon which make my feet sweat more! I prefer 100% cotton socks that can absorb sweat and odor.
5,Ubuntu 6.10 (64-bit PC Edition),I needed it for my new computer. It loaded up like a champ and has been working well ever since.
1,Formerly brilliant band stumbles into mediocrity,"Early A.O. discs are worth buying. BUY THEM! But this one finds the Opera boys trying to preach to their own choir...their church choir that is. The spirit, fire, passion and intellectual questioning of their early works is completely gone. Avoid this disc! Pick up ""For Madmen Only"", ""Alpha & Oranges"" or ""Penguin Dust""."
4,Fans of the Housten-metal sound: thirsty?,"Comparable to Kings X and Galactic Cowboys stuff in many ways, I found myself enjoying this material perhaps even a little bit more. The prog characteristics of this album are not over-the-top, but the band does implement some odd time signatures and incorporates a lot of different instruments into their hard rock setup (cello, mandolin, dulcimer, ocarina, chapman stick, and organ, just to name a few). Best of all is the great sense of melody that permeates the album, with tasteful vocal harmonies and musicianship throughout. There is a bit of a modern/alternative rock flavor to the music, evidenced by the 12 short, catchy songs that make up the whole of the album, but I still found the song-writing to be quite interesting. Favorites include ""Silence"" and ""Muse"", with another handful of tracks being of near the same caliber. Fans of Kings X and Galactic Cowboys definitely need to add this to their list."
5,Gospel Cola Kicks Holy Butt,"This is the best Atomic Opera CD yet.Every song has a strong spirtual meaning to it. Even Frank Hart, The lead vocalist says this CD is written for the truth. Who ever buys this CD will not regret it. GO FOR IT !"
1,Awful,"Of all albums by the great bands with the Texas sound, this is the worst. I love King's X, Galactic Cowboys, and early Atomic Opera, but this album is preachy boring nonsense. This could be the worst album I own. So unlistenable, it makes me want to ""stuff it"" while exploring."
5,Totally Awesome!,"This is an excellent documentary on the controversial hip-hop/rap group, The Insane Clown Posse. If you are a fan of the Clown Posse, I strongly suggest that you purchase this video. This video contains ICP's music videos for Halls of Illusion, Piggy Pie, Chicken Huntin' Slaughterhouse remix, How Many Times, and the European remix of Hokus Pokus!! These videos plus never-before-seen interviews with the Clown Posse...as well as a retrospect of all the craziness that goes down at their concerts with the Wicked Clowns and the Wicked Juggalos!! Also you will receive a FREE jokerscard with every tape you buy...there's 4 to collect SO BUY 4 COPIES OF THIS TAPE! Hey at least it's better to give your money to some psychopathic wicked clowns then to give it to some Preacher who is just gonna spend your money on Faygo and Hookers...BUY THIS VIDEO YO!"
5,So awesome I bought 2 just in case one broke!!!!!!!,"Oh man, i don't even know how to describe this video, ICP showing you the dark side of the carnival. After i got my first one of these videos, i bought another just in case the first broke. I love this video!!!!!!"
5,The Freshest documentory ever made!!,"All uz Juggalos out there, buy this freakin tape. No ICP fan is complete without a little slice of the cheese."
1,trash,"this had to be the worst video i ever saw in my life. i hated icp before i saw this, and now i hate them even more. i don't think anyone should listen to them cuz they suck. don't buy this if you have any taste in music at all."
1,Wrong explanation,Ordered this for my son as we were planning for a long road trip. As I opened the box I noticed that these are urinal bags and not travel potties. Returned!!
3,Kind of like listening to the radio....,"I liked the CD fairly well, but it was more like listening to a radio station than a soundtrack. I liked the songs, but it wasn't really too special, not something I would run and tell my friends about. If you like the show, or CD's of mixed music types, you'll probably enjoy it."
2,Flawed but not without merit,"The so called plot here revolves around shady business deals in the desert perpetrated by an ex-alcoholic who dies suddenly leaving his estranged out-of-work actor son to fly in from England and unravel the mystery from only a curious list of names found in a briefcase. The novel then proceeds to fail its own hackneyed plot device, botching its attempt at conventional detective intrigue. The sense about half way through that the author has no clue where he's going is confirmed by the ludicrous events of the clumsily appended finale. Fortunately for Amidon, the book redeems itself with a precisely evoked desert atmosphere, a sensitive portrayal of human relationships fractured by alcohol abuse and some memorably surreal set pieces, including one involving a drunken widow and a killer cactus! Worth a look for its style if you can bear the absence of direction."
5,A Land on Fire is outstanding - rich in detail and readable,"A Land on Fire is a superb book - informative, rich in detail, and readable. It traces Southeast Asia's environmental challenges through a treasure of engaging stories. In the narrative we meet all kinds of people - farmers, fishermen, indigenous leaders, eco tourism operators, loggers, government foresters, journalists, oil riggers. Woven tightly together with journalistic skill, their stories tell us much about the environmental crisis setting upon Southeast Asia.Thailand is a country I have lived in and know well. From the first page to the last, Fahn shows a profound understanding of the country, a respect for its special qualities, and a passion for preserving its environmental heritage."
3,Planet X again,"Quantum, last Planet X music effort, shows the talent of drummer innovatorVirgil Donati, more involved in the compositional side than the previous records, with keyboards wizard Derek Sherinian and some incredible special guests like Brett Garsed, Jimmy Johnson, Rufus Philpot and the guitar legend Allan Holdsworth.The new record take ahead theirs musical adventure in the unexplored ground of prograssive rock fusion, with new compositions and some new arragements of older material, featuring advanced armonic and rhythmic concepts and highly technical soloing skills although the overall production seam less good ( drum sounds expecially ) compared with the previous Moon Babies.Anyway a must for progressive fusion lovers..."
1,"Paid For Some Cool Art, CD Is Now A Coaster","Amazon deleted my previous review on this album. No matter. I decided to give these guys another try to see if they would grow on me. They didn't. I can't get past the first minute of each track before I skip to the next one. I agree with another reviewer who said something like it was just a scrambled mess. The artwork is the best thing on the album.It sounds like they recorded this album in seperate studios, not even listening to what the other member was playing, and then tried to make it fit together. It just didn't work at all. I was a fan of Derek when he was inDream Theater, so I had high expectations from him here. I can see why they got rid of him for Jordan. His solos sound drunk and everything else sounds like synth from a casio.I hope their other albums are better than this. From the samples I heard on Amazon they don't sound any different. Please Derek, go sell used cars or host a radio show. You certainly can't pick band members to play with."
5,Impressive and hopeful.,"I was impressed enough with this book to use one of it's characters as my psuedonym. In this age of computerized living, that speaks volumes. The one thing I have heard time and again in regard to this book is that the reader was sorry it came to an end and I whole-heartedly agree. I lead a busy and often stress filled life and I found this book to be an oasis of adventure, a sacred space as well as a place to ponder deeply some of the truths that are 'hidden' in the text. I think it stands as a touchstone to modern spiritual thinking and I am quite certain that much of what Mary Blue has written about the after life will prove surprisingly true. It did change the way I think about passion and what is important in life."
4,Classic Lazarus Long,"Explains a lot I hadn't entirely understood about the Lazarus Long stories. If you enjoyed Time Enough for Love, this one will work for you as well."
3,Super Reader,"When the general population learns of the Howards and their mutant ability that lets them live much longer than normal people, there is a crackdown, and the government starts hunting them down.A compromise does happen, even with pressure as th e ability is revealed to be genetic, not a treatment.Cue Lazarus Long here. The rogue returns to provide a focal point for the mutants, and we get some space adventuring after this."
3,Sexual Fantasies,"This book shows some of Heinlein's old brilliance but, like many of his books written in his older years, gets hung up on sex. It is almost as if he were writing his teen fantasies of sex. It was still a good book."
5,To Sail Beyoud the Sunset on the Kindle,"I would like to review any KINDLE books by author Robert A. Heinlein.The following are among my favorites, but only the first two are available on the Kindle.Robert A. Heinlein Novelsfeaturing Lazarus Long:* Methuselah's Children* Time Enough for Love* The Number of the Beast* The Cat Who Walks Through Walls* To Sail Beyond the SunsetWalt Piemmewcpiemme@comcast.net"
3,Generic Heinlein?,Picked it up at a used bookstore because it was one of the few Heinlein books I hadn't read. It didn't thrill me like I wanted it to. Feels like I have read it all in other stories.
2,Yaaaaawn...,"It's been a long time since a few DM albums in 1997 that I fell asleep before 3rd track is finished. They are actually disgracing the Death Metal that I love. Good Death Metal should make listeners feel excited and ""thrilled"" to make them play the CD again and again, while the works from this band just make listeners ""TIRED""..in a negative sense."
5,"a ""must read"" book for all ages","I just got done with this book and even though it did not break my heart or make me cry, ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" had a great impact on me. It amazes me on how James Hilton wrote this book overnight and how much it interacted with us. This is surly a must read book and one you will remember your whole life."
4,"Goodbye, Mr. Chips","I read this book in 8th grade, it touched me for life. Reading of such a caring, kind man made the book incredibly enjoyable. The book is easy to read, but interesting to all ages."
3,Mixed feelings,"My opinion of this book is mixed. I liked that it was easy to read and the story was nice, but there wasn't a whole lot to it. The main character lived his life mainly alone, except for the wife he had for a few years. He was old enough to be her father and they didn't seem compatible. She died during childbirth and after that he went back to being alone. He loved his job but towards the end of his career, he was almost forced to resign because his teaching style was old-fashioned. That is easy to understand since he had taught for over thirty years and he hadn't changed his style since his first year at Brookfield. He dies at an old age surrounded by his friends, and he thinks his life was for the most part fulfilled. Overall, it was an easy read but there wasn't a whole lot to it. The story was kind of boring and it didn't really touch me in any way."
2,kind of boring plot...,"even though it was very educational, and touching, i didn't like this. the story plot was too boring."
3,it was OK,"i'm not a teacher, just a 17 year old student, and i read this book, and it was just OK. it wasn't anything incredibly brilliant. I guess i just can't relate."
1,The worst book I have ever read in my life!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok. I am a male from Marietta, Georgia, and I am in 8th grade. This was the worst book I have ever, I would have given this book negative stars if I could. This is book has no plot, and it is very confusing. It is confusing, because the settings change rapidly, so it is hard to know what i going on. Also, the tenses change from present to past in each chapter! This book really only has one main character, and that is Mr. Chips. He has the most boring life. The book tells about Mr. Chips's life as a teacher at a place called Brookfield. Brookfield is in England. If I were you, the reader, I would not take the time to read this book, unless you want to have a short book with pictures in it. The only reason I chose this book is, because it has more than 30 pictures and is only 115 pages counting the pictures. I will never read any books by James Hilton as long as I live."
4,Great bike for yhe price,"I own a bike rental store and I use these bikes. One of the best cruisers on the market for the price. Believe me, I have went throuth countless crusier brands and these perform. those other reviews are silly. You can pay a ton more for a lesser product."
2,Cruisers suck - law suit alert,"bolt on stem sheared!! after 2 months. Tell me if I should throw a lawsuit...fortunately I didn't realize this while on the road. Overall, most and all cruisers are bulky and have poor balance. For simple and solid classic philosophy, buy rather Amsterdam bike. Import from Europe or Japan if you can afford to, or buy the US version from Electra."
5,Great Compilation From Late Lounge,"This CD is a must for anyone familiar with London's Jazz FM's show, the Late Lounge. Weeknights from Midnight - 3AM GMT (7PM-10PM EST), Rosie Kendrick plays a great mix of chilled out tracks. You can listen to Jazz FM from anywhere in the world via their website. Definitely worth checking out."
1,"If you like pablum, you'll love this book","If you like good writing, fully-drawn characters, nuanced story-telling, you won't like this book. Miller takes a premise that has the potential for being compelling and reduces it to platitudes. We never really learn how the pioneers in Nicodemus survived the winter, how the harshness and stress affected the families and communities. Dr. Boyle's bratty daughter and wastrel son are transformed into compassionate human beings simply by turning the page from one chapter to the next. I literally looked back to see if my book was missing a chapter! Where did these new personas come from? The air of Kansas? This book is too self-righteous for it's own good. The writing is simplistic at best. If you like GOOD books, don't bother with this one."
4,"Not perfect, but if the price is right, grab it...","This compilation of Baker tracks recorded between 1955 and '65 is a nice overview of his work in that decade. The only two weak selections are ""I'll Remember April"" and ""Everytime We Say Goodbye"" which feature vocals by Caterina Valente, whose jazz talents do not impress. Frankly, if I want singing on a Chet Baker disc, I'd rather he do it himself, because he was pretty good at it. This CD only allows him one vocal, ""The Touch of Your Lips."" I found my copy in a bargain bin, and I skip the Valente numbers, which are back-to-back, and revel in the other 13."
1,They wore nit cillor they were black,"In additio to that several were broken at the end. I really wated the collored ones, I could have gotten the black ones anywhare"
4,Good value. Nice every-day set.,"Note that this set is from the ""Silver Point"" collection. It is NOT the standard forged Wusthof knife. However, it is stamped from the same high-quality steel. The knives feel very light as a result, and they are very, very thin. But they do keep a great edge, and slice through steak effortlessly. My old steak-knives were totally shot and I was having some people over for a rib-roast, so I needed to get a new set of knives cheap. This set more than fit the bill. While these knives are far too lightweight for serious cooking tasks, they are more than up to slicing your prime-rib. I am sure that they will not have the tremendous longevity of the ""Grown up"" Wusthof knives, but for the price it's hard to go wrong. My only complaint is that they are so light, they feel insubstantial compared to my flatware."
4,Weezer back to thier best,"When will i ever get tired of weezer? They don't change much with each album, but every album is as consistently good as the last. Well, amazon is spot on with its review, Maladroit blows away anything from the dissapointing Green album. Its more emo influenced, like pinkerton was, 'death and destruction' almost sounds like radiohead. If you were unsatisfied with the green album like i was, this should satisfy you. I give it 4.5/5."
2,Not My Weezer,"Maladroit is a good CD in its own right, however, for a Weezer CD it's just not that great. The Weezer I know is the Weezer of the Blue Album and Pinkerton. Their new form of poppy punk powerchord rock is just not what I fell in love with so many years ago with the Blue album. I think most die hard weezer fans would agree with me in the fact that Weezer really isn't as awesome as they once were. This CD is good, but it's not my Weezer."
3,good pop songs with cool solos,"maladroit is an album full of songs to sing along to and ""rock out"" to, as it were. the music that weezer is putting out recently is nowhere near as good as their past efforts, and great pop songs is all that is here. not a bad thing, but considering what they have done in the past, this album can't be looked at as the definitive weezer experience. if you don't have their first two albums, start with green, then maladroit, then their other two (pinkerton and s/t). that way you progress in quality."
4,Better Than Green,"Although I liked ""The Green Album"", This CD has much better songs. Weezer's latest CD goes even further back to it's roots than ""The Green Album"" did. A great CD for Weezer fans old, and new."
2,Very Average,having heard so much about this Group over the past few Weeks I had to hear what all the Hype was about.well the material to me was Over-Produced in spots&the Material doesn't always hang with the Songs themselves.the Album feels like it was Forced to sound a certain way as to being a full Concept theme.Weezer to me is a Cross between The Cars Meets Sugar Ray.those type of Bands have catchy Material but ask somebody a couple Years later what did they do&Nobody can hardly remember a thing.
3,"Not a bad album, but it's just Rivers, not Weezer","Anyone who tells you that this is weezer's ""finest hour"" or ""best album yet"" or any of that nonsense doesn't know what they are talking about: Weezer was a band where Matt Sharp and Rivers Cuomo wrote songs together, creating the much-loved Blue album and the magnificent Pinkerton. Now Rivers writes adequate love anthems from a cottage in the hills where he speaks only to Japanese girls and strictly over the internet. It's true!"
3,better than the Green album,After a very dissapointing album they quickly released Maladroit which is more on par with what we expect from Weezer. It's not as great as blue album or pinkerton but it sits nestled in third place for now. There are some real great songs on here as well as some bland ones. they shouldve cut 3 songs on here and it would have been a lot better.
5,Cool Stuff from a Cool Band,"Maladroit is a great addition to any Weezer fan's collection. Maladroit is a cross between the the pure pop of the Green Album and the musical finese of Pinkerton. With hardly driven guitar riffs and catchy pop hooks, it'll please both new ""Green Album"" fans and old school ""Blue Album"" fans. With songs such as Take Control, Dope Nose, Keep Fishin', and Slave, Weezer brings the goods. The album as a whole isn't worth five stars, but it deserves better than four. The last couple songs of Maladroit do become a little bland, but their certainly not bad songs. Rivers definitely wanted to rock on this album, breaking out into crazy guitar solos almost every song. It's cool, and adds a nice touch to the album. Also, their live show is awesome, a little short, but awesome none the less. Both the album and their live show are worth a check out."
3,Quality Not Quantity...,"Weezer's fourth studio album entitled ""Maladroit"" was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor. There was no shortage of material for the album as the band had dozens of different versions of over thirty different songs circulating on the Internet prior to the release. After an experimental approach in the recording process, the band settled on 13 tracks displaying a harder-edged version of the pop-influenced formula that has made them famous. Though the band had an abundant amount of material to choose from, the quality of ""Maladroit"" falls short of potential. Below, please find the rating for each song individually:American Gigolo - 7/10Dope Nose - 7/10Keep Fishin' - 10/10Take Control - 7/10Death And Destruction - 6/10Slob - 5/10Burndt Jamb - 6/10Space Rock - 3/10Slave - 5/10Fall Together - 7/10Possibilities - 5/10Love Explosion - 5/10December - 5/10"
3,Its pretty good,"This CD is their most different CD in how they don't use their typical constant Quarter note style guitar as much. I love Take control, Death and Destruction, Burnt Jamb and Fall together the most because of the great guitar riffs embeded in the songs and how the style is sort of different from typical weezer.The reason why im giving this three stars though is because I heard the CD at my friends house and then I downloaded all the Tracks on my comp and most of the tracks I downloaded where the demo version of the tracks. I felt they should have used the demo versions on the real CD because I think they are better. Especially Keep Fishing, and Take Control.In my opinion this is a solid weezer CD and a great buy (especially sonce they finally have more then 10 tracks) but I personally like the demos better."
4,Darn good CD,"This is a good follow up to the green album, as yet again, Weezer has changed course (Blue to pinkerton to green) on its musical mission. The boys mix heavy metal/punk riffs with their lighter pop-based side in a way not yet seen. There's a little bit of everything on this cd: garage rock, pop, 3/4 shuffle, punk, 6/8 rock, dare I use the term emo, and much more. It's not as fuzzy sounding as Pinkerton, yet not as poppy as green or blue. A good mix of their many different tastes and influences. If you liked Blue or Pinkerton, this is a CD for you. Strictly pop heads who dig green may not want to venture into this territoy."
1,What happened?,"The Green Album was a little disappointing, but still quite enjoyable. But I think Rivers Cuomo's ego has gone to his head, meaning that he thinks he can write any [song] he wants, put the Weezer sticker on it and say it's a masterpiece. I love listening to every song Weezer has ever put out (not counting Hash Pipe), but I don't think Maladroit has even one song that is anything special at all."
1,Not so hot compared to the quality that we are use to hear'n,"This album feels like a b-side album, left overs from the green album. It starts off great but after the first 3 to 4 songs start to tank. Most of these songs were originally release on weezer.com in non-studio versions. Personally some of the non-studio version were a lot better. Do yourself a favor and download these songs for free on the internet."
4,Sick of Being the Rock Geeks,"Weezers back, and check this...they're trying to be cool! No more geeky band pictures or crazy songs like Undone(the Sweater Song), although Rivers still has the glasses. This CD is a little different from other Weezer-its harder and tries to be a little more serious(although I'm not sure anyone can quite take Weezer seriously). But I love it. It's five minutes longer than their last disappointing Green Album, and I love all the songs on it. It has some tight guitar solos, and like all Weezer, its catchy. It has its cute funny songs(if you've heard Dope Nose...well) but also some sort of serious songs, and it has a good mix. It's a little harder, but it doesn't blast in your ears. In short, if you like Weezer, you like this. If you're not a Weezer fan...give this a chance, at least. Because I think it rocks."
2,Really 2 1/2 stars,"So Weezer releases there second album in a little over one year, and it's more of the same boring drivel. This album drones from one song to another, trying to be 80's heavy rock and then light and popy. But the album never chooses which way to go and so heavy guitar riffs are mixed with sappy harmony and lyric after lyric of being left alone. Had the album gone all heavy or all light and popy, it might have come out better. If you liked the green album, maybe you'll like this, but I was very disappoited. Weezer hasn't inspired me since the Pinkerton album; the lyrics, which are so essential to the songs, have became cliche and thoughtless. One interesting note however, this c.d. has 13 songs intead of the usual ten, and the lyrics have been printed in the liner notes."
2,Weezer is unpredictable,"The 1st 3 songs are moderately good. The 4th song has an excellent guitar riff but is otherwise bad. The 5th song is of bad quality. The 6th song is entitled ""SLOB"" and is in my opinion is the best song on this album. The 7th song has another great guitar riff and O.K. lyrics. The only other decent songs are #10 ""FALL TOGETHER"" and #12 ""LOVE EXPLOSION"" which are almost reminiscent of classic =w=eezer. Overall this album suffers from bad song structure and is very insincere. Also, There is an overemphasis on heartbreak. Altogether there are only (in my opinion) 4 good songs on Maladroit. =w=eezer is a very talented band and have underachieved on Maladroit."
3,save weezer,"I'm probably going to get all the ""not helpful"" votes, and I don't really care. Weezer needs to decide whether or not to record with Ric Ocasek. It seems he helps keep the band focused. Why didn't they choose him this time? The new album leaves much to be desired. There's a few standout tracks, but the rest is filler. I was really excited when I heard the demos, but the real thing just upsets me."
3,"A departure from the earlier sound, but not bad","One thing you're bound to notice is how much less sunny this album is than its predecessors. I'd love to report that, even with a darker bent to the sound, this band still produced clear winners. But that isn't always the case here. There isn't really much of anything on this album in the way of a bad track. A great deal of them just don't live on in your head beyond the listen. Not their best album. But it is still clearly Weezer. And I would still recommend buying it without hesitation. Many bands have been much, much less successful with experimentation than this one. Don't believe me? Then check this disc out."
3,Weezing,"Sandwiched between increasingly generic pop, punk and metal influences do lie Weezer's noteworthy melodic guitar sweeps, though heart-on-sleeve songwriting of yore subsides to straightforward distort-rock that had its moments, only to be degraded further in the future."
2,The Rise and Fall of Weezer,"Weezer has long been one of my favorite bands next to Muse and Radiohead, each with their own unique and distinctive style. Weezer appealed to me through their distorted, yet soft guitars that allowed all the instrumentals to act as one. In their previous albums, they have taken the emo style and gave it a nice kick. In Maladroit however, they seem to have kicked it the wrong way.First of all, their gentle emo seems to have vanished, along with the creative lyrics thrown around with a catchy tune. Weezer diverts from emo into a realm of heavier distortion and louder guitars. Rivers doesn't present many catchy, funny, emotional, or thoughtful tunes, and weezer sounds like they're trying to become metal.I recommend that you take a look at blue or green if you want some classic weezer. =w="
5,Weezer on a roll!,"This is an awesome CD. It has sort of a green album feel to it but also has a pinkerton feel to it also. I admit that 13 tracks is pretty good compared to the usuall 10-11 tracks on older weezer albums. But the songs seem a little short. But quality is better than quantity. I would highly recommend this cd for anyone who liked pinkerton or the green album. It really does not have a feel like the blue album did but is still one that you should at least listen to a couple times. Rivers has to be on a creative high now though, he has been throwing out songs like a mad man and they are truely the cream of the crop!"
1,"Sadly, garbage","Disappointing, messy, sloppy, worthless. Sad, really. After Blue (which is just an incredible power pop record - it pretty much served as the soundtrack to my junior year of high school when it came out) and Pinkerton (which did the same for my freshman year of college), Green was a letdown. Maladroit has kicked me off the Weezer bandwagon for good. It's just a bad album all around. The songs are boring and uninspired - annoying at times. I guess I'll reminisce with the first two albums, and leave the latest two for the newer fans."
4,!,"Maybe this album isnt weezer at their best, but this album has some great songs with some great lyrics. I recommend it for any weezer fan, but not if you are a first time listener."
3,umm...,"okay, this is an okay CD. although, the self titled CD with the blue cover is much better. i highly reccomend that instead. although, you may chose to buy this CD and you may think that the self titled one isn't as good, but i think most people would like the self titled. okay, that's all. :)"
2,"half good, half bad = 2 1/2 stars","""i don't want to grow,even if it's good growth"" - rivers cuomo, ""too late to try""i like literally half the songs on this album, because half of them rock and half of them... wait, are the other half there? they might as well not be. this is really half an album, for which i paid full price.i love(d?) weezer, but it's obvious rivers is ""missing something."" he doesn't want to open up, and it's hurting weezer's songs.i like this album more than a LOT of weezer fans, especially after the *complete* garbage which was weezer's green album, but i must not like maladroit too much, since i never listen to it. but i do like what weezer did on half of the songs, with the hard riffs and wild solos.. a lot of people think it's derivative of old metal bands, but i think it just rocks."
4,Weezer: A New Opinion,"I have recenlty become the owner of the new Weezer album, Maladroit. After listening to each of the songs a couple of times and watching the really cool live videos I have reached the conclusion that Weezer are my new favourite band. I would strongly reccemmend that anyone who likes really good music mixed with an equally good band, goes and buyus this album."
4,Weezer is back,"I hated the green album. It lacked feeling, humor, guitar solos, charm, and everything that makes weezer great. When I heard that they were releasing Maladroit so quickly, I figured I was in for more of them same, and I determined that I wouldn't buy it. Out of curiousity I downloaded a few live tracks. The first song was pretty good. As was the second, as was the third. Moments later i was driving to the record store. Maladroit finds Weezer back to doing what they do best. It's a pop-punk record with lots of arena-rock jokes, a loose feel, great guitar solos, and the requisite amounts of humor and quirkiness. The music is a lot like some of the Pinkerton stuff, and the lyrics seem less mindless than those on Green, although I've been too busy rocking out to notice. It gets four stars for not being quite as good as Blue or Pinkerton, but I am THRILLED that weezer is back. A great record for kicking off summer."
3,"Good, but not Great!","Well, this album, the fourth from the kings of catchy power pop, has for some reason strayed from what made them great. The first 3 songs have you thinking nothing has changed with choruses you wont be able to stop singing to yourself, as with the older stuff.Then something odd happens! They slow down, not in a good way like Only in Dreams, but in a really laboured, heel dragging way. This goes on for the rest of the album, just when you think they're back to their happy selves, along comes something like 'Slave' to drag it down again.Bottom line: if you were expecting 8 good songs out of 13 you'll be happy.The most frustrating thing of all is some of the demos they recorded that didnt make it to the album are classics, of Blue Album standard.Maybe to the passive Weezer fan Maladroit might rock, but I'm not so sure how the die-hards will take it......."
1,i didn't like it,can't sing along because melodies are not memorable and drag on and have too many unrelated parts.the songs sound more like medlies than melodies.the songs are cluttered w/ different ideas and patterns that don't relate constantly pulling you out of the songs.in other words i couldn't get into this album.for example blue was like 1010 1010 10 10 10000 1010 this album was like 1562765hghbv2jhtru65458265r8365 couldn't follow it.except for slave the rest of the album is no crowd participation background music.in less you just make a complete joke and hold hands and bounce around happily like your on seasame street.this album is less balanced less natural & less dynamic than the older albums.
2,"Sniff sniff, something stinks.","Weezer, you suck now. I haven't even made it all the way through this album. I almost get there, but get bored and turn it off. Give up on the gimmicky stuff. Green was bad enough, and now this? Wow. Hide yourselves in shame."
1,Worse than the green album!( And that's pretty bad),"When I heard that Weezer was coming out with a new album after the horribly dissapointing Green Album, I was almost giddy. This was going to be Weezer's come back album. But I was wrong. They just photocopied all the songs from the green album, added new riffs and changed the name. This is a horrible album to be blunt, don't even bother buying it. Download a couple songs, but this is certainly not buy worthy. Go out and spend your money on something worth while, like Pinkerton, for instance..."
3,An album released to soon.,"Just a year after the incredible ""Green Album"" was released, Weezer gives us ""Maladroit."" This album was rushed and it shows. I had high hopes for this album after hearing Dope Nose being played, but that song was the best on the album and with the exception of Slob and Burndt Jamb, the songs don't give the listener much of reason to keep this one turning."
1,"IT BLOWS CHUNKS SO HARD YOU""LL WISH FOR BRITNEY","As you may have inferred from my less than optimistic title, i hate this piece of crap. Rivers should have ""experimented"" with more mind-altering junk substances for this falls way short for anyone claiming to be under the influence, in order to be ""creative"". He should pay you for this sad aftermath of what a once great band used to be. Anyone who used to like alternative who listens to this will be converted, but to the evil side of pop princesses."
2,why weezer? why? : (,"this was the only album i have ever had send back, i am a great fan of old weezer i enjoyed the blue album and the green album, even pinkerton. but maladroit lacked something, something very important that the other albums possessed especially the blue album! the songs on maladroit lack feeling and the lyrics sound forced and from the brain not the heart. keep fishin is the best track on the album but over all i don't like it, they might have permeantly lost somthing special, just hope they work harder on thier next album and start to produce better music! sorry weezer but my hope for you is falling rapidly!"
2,the short wait was not worth it.,"I know Weezer has a lot of songs that they want to show the viewing public, but i think they put out Maladroit a little to soon. The only good songs on the cd are the first 3 and 'possibilities'. For the rest of the songs, they sound like he wrote them in the 30 seconds it took for his Hotpocket to finish cooking in the microwave. Weezer is my favorite band and i cannot belive that i don't love this cd as much as the others. Hopefully, they will take a little more time on their next cd. Despite what people thing 2 years in between albums is an average time period. Keep this in mind Weezer, but other than that, keep up the good work."
1,disappointment,"This is an indulgent mess. These guys should play to their stengths which are in pop economy, not 70s riffage and free association. If i want that, I'll go to the pros (Fu Manchu).From weezer, i expect tight little rock songs biting with irony. ""Hash Pipe"" got the job done. This record fails miserably."
1,A GREAT BAND DESTROYS THEIR LEGACY,"The blue album is a classic. Pinkerton was Great, but sold only 500,000 records. I can't imagine Weezer being a band of junkies or whatnot, but they must be addicted to something that costs a lot of money. 500,000 records is pretty damn good, so if you're going to make your two albums musically and emotionally shallow because they'll sell better, then I guess there's little we fans can do. Maladroit is the obvious successor to the sellout called the ""green album"". For some reason i thought he'd turn it around for this one. I was very very wrong. It sounds like a group of wanna be rock stars who just happen to sound like weezer. Where'd all the personality go???"
4,Okay,"I love weezer, ever since the first time I heard the blue album. Then green came and got me pretty disappointed, its lyrics were not personal, and where the lyrics seemed so bland and overused. But this album is a step better. The lyrics have more feeling to it, the guitar work is pretty good, and it has some pretty great melodies. I recommend to get this album after you get Blue and Pinkerton, but definitely not before The Green Album or The disappointing Make Believe."
2,Mediocre,"I agree with the other reviewer that the departure of Matt Sharp killed the true Weezer. I miss his bass lines and falsetto. Although I will always love Weezer and the emo genre in particular, this boring, ear-grating, unmemorable disc is a big disappointment. I mean, I feel like I need Prozac after listening to it, and Weezer used to make me feel so happy and upbeat. Remember ""In the Garage,"" ""Surf Wax America"" and ""The Sweater Song""? Those were the good old days. Those will be ingrained in my mind forever. However, after listening to Maladroit a couple dozen times, the only song that really stands out is ""Dope Nose."" I am all for good emo and sad songs (I highly recommend the Get Up Kids) but Maladroit's sound is more impotent anger than heartbreak. And Weezer never, EVER had lyrics this trite! Every lovesick cliche is used over and over again. Please, please, Rivers, bring back the old Weezer! Please tell us you haven't sold out."
3,Good...,"This feels like a very quick follow-up to last album Weezer (The Green Album), which I was only just getting used to. Fortunately it finds Weezer in good form, reliving the excellent breezy summery geek rock tunes of their first album and the nastier, emo-heavy Pinkerton. The only criticism I have to make is this feels a bit like Green Album Volume 2. Its similar in style most of the time; both albums contain a first single with a word for cannabis in them, and Maladroit comes hot on The Green Album's heels. In fact, one song even appears on both albums: and they could scarcely have picked a worse one: the annoying prozac-happy Island In The Sun, possibly the worst track on The Green Album. Yet this is made up for with most of the rest of the album. Though, in the wake of nu-metal, how any band can seriously title a track Death and Destruction is beyond me."
2,Please dont buy this,"hey,,, sorry weezer fans,,, i am an ex weezer fan who loved blue album and pinkerton,,, i was not a fan of the green album. I thought it was barely decent. This album just [isn't reight] though. I was looking forward to at least some good old catchy melodies from Rivers, but was thoroughly disappointed"
5,Great stuff!,"This is a great cd, it is Weezer kicking more ... than ever.What makes this cd so great is that it's very different on each song. One song will be true Weezer Blue Album style, then it will be true Pinkerton style. Burndt Jamb and Take Control are awesome songs. Rivers and Brian are unleashing all their talent in this cd. True, some moments do have a bit off an emo feel to them, but it's not whiny, self pitying emo-core like Staind or Linkin Park. It's more of a light and happy emo, and i think that is okay. Who says rock stars have to bring their own self-pity into their music? I don't want to be all sad when I listen to music, I mean, mellow stuff like Radiohead is cool because it's not depressing, its just mellow. That's just my opinion. I'm not gonna give a run through of all the songs because they are all awesome. So what are you waiting for?!?!?! BUY THIS CD!!!!!"
5,Bringing back the rock!,"Weezer is back. After a bland ""Green"" Album, the boys from LA have returned to show that rock is still around. This cd breaks a lot of traditions for Weezer. There is no color in the title, more than 10 songs, and the lyrics are printed in the booklet! Its good to see Weezer back and rocking out. Buy the cd right now!"
3,not bad but not as good as other releases,This does not define Weezer as artists as much as the Blue or Green albums do. Nonetheless it is not bad either. Fans of the Blue and Green albums might like this but those are the two to get first and foremost. Weezer is good though so this cd won't disappoint most people.
3,(3.5 stars) very inconsistent.,"This album doesn't exactly stand out in my collection. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it just sounds too much like.. everything else to be compared to Pinkerton and the blue album. Some songs are really REALLY good (fall together, the best and tightest song on the album, keep fishin, slob) and some that are way to mainstream(possibilities, slave) and some that just dont' stand out (burndt jamb, space rock, love explosion). Most songs have a very tight guitar riff which isn't like them at all. I don't think this album is bad. I think it's different. Probably the same amount of people like this album as their older stuff, just different people. I listen to it often, but I really prefer Pinkerton."
2,Change is BAD,"I am a big fan of Weezer and I love their music from the earlier albums, but when I first heard Maladroit I was disappointed. They seemed to have completely changed their style and lost the familiar ""weezer"" feel. What happed to the genius lyrics and unique melodies? The songs from Maladroit sound too generic and commercial; not written from the heart like they used to be. The album lacks the strong emotions and creative lyrics found in earlier albums like Pinkerton, and I can't take the songs seriously. It's a shame that people who have only heard Maladroit may overlook Weezer without having heard the old albums. I think this album turns away potential fans who would otherwise love Weezer as much as I do. I hope they go back to their old ways and make their next album more like the older ones and not like Maladroit."
4,Excellent CD,"I'm a huge fan of this Weezer CD. The Blue album grew old with me back in the day, and the Green album wrote a check it couldn't cash: the songs were catchy for the first 10 listens, then turned flat and uninspired as quickly as they caught my ear upon first listen. Relative to those two releases, I find ""Maladroit"" much superior: the edginess and rawness of the musicianship and vocals are compelling enough to merit repeated listenings, and keep the songs from growing tired. This is modern rock and roll at its best.Every song has about 5 rock influences combined into 3 short minutes or less: surf music, glam rock, punk, and classic rock are all crammed into each song on the album, making it a much more interesting listen than ""Green"" (too-obvious, formulaic pop). I don't know that there are any obvious hit singles on the album, which makes it that much more appealing for the listener who finds nothing interesting on the current record charts. Highly recommended."
4,A much different direction,"After hearing Hash Pipe over and over on the radio, I went out and bought the Green Album, haveing never previously been acquanted with Weezer. What I got was suprising, but not dissapointing. Maladroit is the album I expected green to be. Dope Nose and American Gigolo are both killer tracks and the album, in general, is a lot harder than the Green one. Probably a bit less enjoyable but definatley a lot deeper. I'm sure it'll age a lot better than its predeccesor too."
5,ASTOUNDING!,"I used to think that ""Pinkerton"" was Weezer's best. I was wrong. ""Maladroit"" is Weezer's best. The songs are strong and addicting. The songs on this album are heavier than the ones on the ""Green Album."" This album is like the ""Blue Album"" and ""Pinkerton"" put together.I got CD last saturday and I have not took it out of my CD player yet. The songs that I like on this record are ""Dope Nose,"" ""Keep Fishin',"" ""Take Control,"" and ""Space Rock."" This is awesome. For those of you that hated the Green Album and want the old Weezer back, this is them with a new twist. I give ""Maladroit"" five stars because it is so awesome."
5,Strongest Album?,"Many critics are heralding Maladroit as Weezer's strongest album yet, and this is a similar reccomendation. Weezer is one of the most inventive bands around, changing styles every album, yet staying within their geek-rock basis. Maladroit can best be explained as Pinkerton with a bit of Blue Album thrown in. While there is nothing bad about the Green Album, this latest release cries back to the days of when Weezer was still struggling and sticking to their guns. The only weak part of this album may be Death and Destruction, an originally instrumental piece that Rivers seems to have thrown words into. While still a great song, it seems weak among thel likes of Dope Nose, Slave, and Love Explosion. I reccomend this album for any Weezer fan, or for anyone who wants to experience the greatest rock around."
5,Enjoy the Show,"I was the first person outside the store to get this album in my town, and it hasn't left my CD player since.In typical Weezer fashion, it's only about half an hour long, but a half hour that can repeated to over 3,000,000 hours.The band found a good balance between the upbeat spirited Blue and Green albums and the lyrical pain of Pinkerton.Such pain as seen like on ""Slob"" where Rivers wails about how people tell him to ""Get himself a wife, get himself a job"".It's full of all the sonic guitar sounds Weezer has come to be known for, but they throw in more heavy chugging riffs, like on ""Death and Destruction"" and ""Dope Nose"".Every song is great and I wish I could just sing all the praise in the world. I recommend picking it up if you're a fan, own at least one of their albums or heard the buzz. My Weezer urge has been satisfied."
5,Great CD and Weezer does it again,This is a great new album by weezer and has some great songs on it.
3,"4 for the instrumentals, 2 for the vocals","Rivers Cuomo (the lead singer) used to sing with great passion, emotion, and power. His vocals were one of the best aspects of Weezer's songs. But in the previous album and more so in this album, his passion is gone. In fact, often you can barely hear his voice; it just subtly blends in with the rest of the music. Rivers ought to return to the style that worked so well in the mid '90s.-Lee J. Markowitz"
3,Listenable...,"I've been a Weezer fan since the Blue album. The first album, Pinkerton and the following B-sides (Jamie, Suzanne, etc.) were pure work of genius, but Maladroit isn't by far equal to those. If you're a big Weezer fan and was dissapointed by Green, be assured that this one is way better but, again, not a masterpiece. Its cool that Rivers went for a more goofy hard rock writing approach on this but there's still that redondance found on the Green album. There's also like 6 video clips included on this that makes it worth the buy."
1,"Really, really bad.","This CD is probably worth two stars, but I gave it one because many people only write reviews to recommend items, not to prevent people from buying them.I buy a lot of CDs, one a week or so and many blindly, and I can safely say that in the last two years, I have enjoyed every one. This one stopped my streak. It's just [bad], ok for the-alternative-station-that-loves-creed-and-incubus, but really just [bad]. I sold it back in a week to the store I bought it for a $7.00 loss."
4,IM NUMBER ONE!!!!!!,"This isn't a very good CD.The lyrics make obsilutly no sense, and the music doesnt go together, like in DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, it starts out slow, then out of no where comes a fast role on the floor tom, then slow again, the another beat, and this is in the first 11 seconds.My favorite songs are AMERICAN GIGOLO,FALL TOGETHER,POSSIBILITIES, and DOPE NOSE. SPACE ROCK is also kind of good since it has a wierd yet great sound to it.If you want WEEZER at their best, buy THE BLUE ALBUM.If you want a great WEEZER CD, get PINKERTON.If you want WEEZER at their worst, buy THE GREEN ALBUM.If you want a cool sounding WEEZER CD, get MALADROIT."
2,C'mon people!,"Rivers has lost it. Everyone knows it and no one wants to admit it. Every album since their awesome debut has been a little bit worse than the one before it and I can only imagine that ""Make Beleive"" is gonna continue this trend. Rivers would be serving the music world much better as a lead guitarist in some random dude's up and coming band because the guitar work, as always, is pretty good, but the songs he puts around the solos just pale in comparison."
2,Crappy Band,weezer turned me away when they came out with the cd single island in the sun. ever since i never liked them. if you like soft rock crap this cd is for you
4,Maladroit,"Maladroit being Weeezer's 4th studio album and their 2002 release and is a mix of emo, alternative rock and pop punk. Two singles were released from this album. These being ""Dope Nose"" and ""keep fishin"". The best track though is ""Island in the sun"". All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with a few blurry photos of the band. Allmusic and Rolling Stone gave the album 4/5 and so do I. 4/5."
5,For Only True Weezer Fans!,"This is a great album. Rivers Cuomo proves he is a rock God with this well crafted album. From beginning to end I was wrapped up in this record. Personal favorites include ""Love Explosion"" and ""Burndt Jamb."" A must have for a true Weezer Fan."
3,Nu Weezer takes controll,"Well, weezer as we know them to be, is dead. This latest album ""maladroit"" gives us a new weezer. Gone is the stand-out personality of mikey sharp, the previous bass player who gave the band an edge of punk sound, falsetto harmoney, and highlightited there geek-pop personality. In his place is Scott Shriner, a self proclaimed ""metal head"". Instead of falsetto harmoney he brings deep rocking bass lines. He also has helped Rivers to unleash his metal head nature and catchy guitar parts are now replaced with soaring solos and fuzzy distortion. This nu weezer is not a bad thing, just diffrent. I would suggest getting the other three albums over this one, but maladroit has a charm to it as well. Dead is weezer, long live nu weezer."
3,4 stars for anyone but weezer,"if ur like me, u luved blue and pinkerton, 2 of the greatest albums of all time! the feelgood syle on blue, sexual tension on pinkerton, and ""weezer energy"" on both of those combined for 2 killer albums. green was a step down though. for anyone it was great, but weezer's at a different standard. anyhow, maladroit was disappointing, bcuz it was just a normal poprock album. though ""keep fisin'"" is an awesome song (a throwback to blue) and all of the tracks are mediocre at the worst, i kno weezer could do better. where are tracks like ""no one else"" and ""pink triangle""? hopefully weezer will do better on their 5th album, which is slated for arrival sometime relatively early next year. in sum, this is an OK album to get, but at least buy blue and pinkerton first."
2,Undercooked,"Fast on the heels of last years Weezer (Green Album) comes Maladroit. Reports have it that the big bad record company (Geffen by way of Universal) tried to suppress River Cuomo's creative muses and asked them to hold off on release until the songs were ready. Cuomo streamed the songs out over the internet, and Geffen/Uni was forced to put out Maladroit. Give Cuomo props for beating the majors at their own game. Then listen to the record and give the record company props for hearing songs that range from expert (""Dope Nose"", ""Slave"") to awkward (""Slob"", ""Burndt Jamb""). Cuomo's calls the new tracks raw, but sometimes that doesn't mean exposed, just undercooked."
4,Harder Weezer,"Maladroit is rapidly becoming a disc that's going to remain in my player for a while. When I first listened to it, it reminded me a lot of the Blue Album but with a more cracked-out-guitars feel. The guitar work is excellent and a ""bit"" harder/heavier than their other CD's. Lyrically, they're a lot more original than the Green Album. I had to TRY to like the Green, but with this one, it comes natural."
3,Weezer,"So Weezer releases there second album in a little over one year, and it's more of the same boring drivel. This album drones from one song to another, trying to be 80's heavy rock and then light and popy. But the album never chooses which way to go and so heavy guitar riffs are mixed with sappy harmony and lyric after lyric of being left alone. Had the album gone all heavy or all light and popy, it might have come out better. If you liked the green album, maybe you'll like this, but I was very disappoited. Weezer hasn't inspired me since the Pinkerton album; the lyrics, which are so essential to the songs, have became cliche and thoughtless. One interesting note however, this c.d. has 13 songs intead of the usual ten, and the lyrics have been printed in the liner notes."
4,I like it.,"Despite it's noticeable difference from the other three Weezer albums, I have enjoyed nearly all the tracks on Maladroit. It's interesting to hear a new style from this great band, and although hardcore Weezer fans may disapprove to some extent, I believe this is a step in the right direction. They haven't taken themselves away from the ska genre... just added a taste of punk/metal. All of you should take a listen..."
2,Two disappointing albums in a row...,"Where can I start? The Blue Album is a classic album with sixties pop hooks and harmonies. Pinkerton, the follow-up, is weird and experimental, but definitely still worth listening to. The Green Album has a couple good songs, but that's about it. Which brings us to Maladroit. Weezer started off as a great band on their first two albums. Somehow along the way, they started to decline with the Green Album and now are further declining with Maladroit. While Maladroit has a couple good songs, the rest of it isn't worth listening to. Where are the pop hooks from the Blue Album? Where's the experimental edge from Pinkerton? The majority of the songs on Maladroit were written and performed with a half-hearted effort from the band, in my opinion. Let's hope Album #5 is a much better effort!"
3,illegitimate love child of blue and pinkerton,"i meant to give this album 4 stars, not 3. its good but not quite as good as blue or pinkerton. but that's ok. no one can make every record a 5-star, can they? after the somewhat dissapointing green album, weezer is on their way back to where they started. not quite there, but almost.in true weezer form, they start this album out with a loud, rock song (""american gigolo"") and end with a pretty, melodic tune (""december"") which is one of my all time favorite weezer songs. weezer doesn't do pretty love songs that often, but when they do, they go all out.personally, i like every song except for ""take control"" and ""slob"". i think that they should have left those 2 off the record and it would have been all the better for it. but that's just my opinion.i hope this album is a sign of better things to come, and i can't wait for the new album next year."
1,They tricked us.,"When i heard that Weezer's new CD was comming out, i was so excited. I went directly to their website to see when it came out. When i got there i listened to the mp3's that let you listen to the first 5 or 6 songs. When i heard these songs i was so excited i couldn't contain myself. I had to buy the new cd the day it got out. WHen i did i was unpleasently supprised. There first 5 songs are the only decient songs on the entire cd. The rest are all slow usless songs. It seems like Rivers just wrote these real fast before his eggroll got done in the microwave. I am one of weezers biggest fans and i only listened to this cd about 3 times in the last 4 months i've had it. This thing is such a piece of [junk] i just pray that they don't play these songs at the concert. Please anyone who was comtemplating buying this cd. Please borrow it from someone. No one in this world is bad enough to be forced to give money for this thing."
2,Just Average,"I'm a big mascara buff and was very disappointed with this product. Marketing it as ""Big, Big, Gorgeous Eyes"" leads you to believe that the results would be dramatic. Not so.... This mascara was just average...nothing special at all and definitely not worth the inflated price. If you really want big, gorgeous eyes, I recommend Rimmel, L'Oreal's Voluminous or Lash Out, or Mary Kay's Signature....all are wonderful."
1,poor bullmastiff info,"i agree with other reviewers who posted comments in amazon.com, this is a dog care book with some bullmastiff photos only, i would recommend bullmastiff fanciers to try : ""The Mastiff and Bullmastif Handbook"" by Douglas Oliff instead."
3,First Hand Knowledge,"My mother & father, Mary & Karl Prescott founded Scyldocga Kennels and were directly responsible for this breed in America. After much success, my mother was approached by the original publisher to lend her name to this series. She regretted it much later. The book was primarily a ghost-writer book with a small amount of direct input and a few photos."
1,Not written by a winner.,This book is not a very good book on shuffleboard. Top shuflers ignore it. The book by Haslam is much beter.
4,Very pleasant! Very different!,"These four concerti are very unusual in their choice of featured instruments, with compositions for tuba, harp, xylophone, and saxophone. These are charming and delightful works. Give it a listen! You won't be sorry."
1,"Funny if Waldo reads in an ""evil"" voice and laughs maniacally after Act 1","My class read this aloud in English a year ago, and I read for Waldo (Hey, artistic license...); but seriously this play is kind of overrated. These playwrights are of no great literary caliber, and civil disobedience is possibly the most overrated type of civic action I can think of. Honestly, I don't care if you don't pay taxes. You will just get thrown in jail and get what you deserve, like Thoreau did. The only reason it worked with Gandhi was because the British were so far flung and a declining empire anyways. Also Walden is so autobiographical that you hardly need all of this. I recommend reading Walden instead. I am probably biased because I think President Polk is the 9th best president ever (Between Eisenhower and Andrew Jackson), but this is definitely not one of the best plays out there."
2,phil's own review of viking crown,"here is what phil anselmo himself has to say about viking crown (quoted in REVOLVER magazine may/june 2002)""That was a joke band with me and Opal,and Killjoy from Necrophagia.I played bass guitar.It's like bad,bad,bad black metal.I'm not doing it anymore."""
5,Dull history teachers beware !,"Think of a few people from history (ancient & modern) and if you thought you wanted to know more about Aristotle, Lord Byron, Che Guevara & Billie Holiday this is your ticket - as long as you like your history on spoken word audio and with a comedic element. What would Aristotle make of todays society ? Why did Billie Holiday have such poor taste in men ? These are a couple of the serious questions posed, but mostly Mark Steel provides a very informative insight into their lives with a touch of humour. If you want kids to pay attention in school perhaps lessons should be like this."
3,Yngwie in a Rare Live Performance,"Joe Lynn Turner's (Rainbow) vocals definitely helped the album, now SEE Yngwie's fingers fly over the frets and hear how a true virtuoso of the guitar does the job LIVE. (Kinda funny how he seems to get those skin tight pants a little tighter when he need to sing high backup vocals though...)"
1,There's better deals out there,"At first site, the CD player looks really cool. Also the skip protection on this thing is incredible. The supplied headphones are good quality. The bass boost is nice, but thats about the only good thing about the sound quality. The sound(even with another pair of headphones)is terrible. It is muffled like putting a pillow over a speaker and trying to listen to it. I was expecting a little more for 70 bucks. You could do a lot better than this. It's not worth it, even with the skip-protection! Anyway, maybe i just got a bad one, but it doesn't seem like it. I wouldn't be surprised if they're all that way."
2,Low-Quality Player,"The sound on this thing is truly terrible. The default sound (without bass boost) is dull, with a lot of mid. Since this happens with a lot of portable players, I cranked up the bass - and recieved a rude surprise. The first setting of two, if anything, made the sound even duller than before. The second boost REALLY distorts the sound: the bass starts to hurt your ears, strangely enough, the treble gets augmented, and the mid just disappears. One plus is that the skip protection is nearly foolproof.Bottom line: It's got awful sound, it feels cheaply made, and it's got awful sound."
1,"skips 1st 2 seconds, poor sound","My Walkman skips the first two seconds of any CD and the sound is weak and thin, inadequate richness in the midrange."
1,Pray it functions...,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
1,Inferior product and bad support,"I had this burner for about one year and used it maybe 24-30 times. It unexpectedly stopped seeing any type of CD that I inserted. Kept saying ""no media found"". Called Tech Support and was told the only explanation is a dead laser. In other words, after making less than 3 dozen CDs with this thing, it's now a piece of garbage. Don't waste your money on this brand!"
1,Notyhing more than a Paperweight,"I made the mistake of buying this drive and have experienced similar problems as the two reviews already listed here. Within a week of installation, I began to experience flaky behavior from the drive. Tech support refused to answer my requests, and I found that their phone support was insulting and useless. I've actually taken this out and am using it as a paperweight for my desk inbox. The only thing it is good for is a target for large caliber ammo. This is the best use for this kind of garbage. Don't waste your money on this junk. Spend a few dollars more and go with a known brand."
1,Why would Neve want to star in this movie?,"I wonder why this movie was even made? it could have been a great soft porn. the sex scene at the park with 3 beautiful models was hot, but Neve Cambell was not!Neve is a good actress, but she is not that sexy, sorry.I watched the movie till the end, but somewhere in the middle I was tempted to turn it off. when you see it you will know what i mean. where was the plot in this movie. like someone else said after about 55 minutes things start happening.this movie should have been half an hour long. terrible movie, but fun to watch since Mr. Roger Ebert thinks this is a masterpiece, lol.enjoy and then come back here and say what you really thought about this 'artsy fartsy' movie."
3,not what i expected,This was a pretty intense movie. kind of different. jumped around alot but it was good.
1,mmmmmm...,"mmmmmmm...crap! What the hell was this. I rented this movie because it seems interesting, well I was wrong. Neve, why did you sign for this ""movie""?."
4,Ms. Campbell does it again!,"This movie is a great vehicle for Ms. Campbell It allows her to show her audience that she hasn't forgotten how to double cross those whom are trying to use her for their own gain. Within the process we are treated to the only reason this reviewer purchased the DVD, Neve Campbell! The color and sound are good. The lighting is excellent. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed Ms. Campbell in ""Wild Things""."
2,MY REVIEW: 2.5/5,I saw this movie ten months ago and I still don't understand the point. Yeah Neve Campell gets naked and Ebert & Ropert gave it two thumbs up but who cares. The storyline is completely stupid and it's way too boring. NOT RECOMMENDED.
2,when will i turn it off,"what are you all on about?, i didn't enjoy this at all, it had interesting moments, sure if you're a fan of Neve Campbell it's worth a watch, but otherwise, forget it. stick to ""Wild Things"", and I don't mean literally"
1,A waste of time...,"This movie has an extremely shallow plot about extremely shallow people doing extremely shallow things. The background music is irritating, the dialogue is hard to comprehend, and even Neve Campbell's shower scene is a disappointment (if that's the sort of thing you are into). And no, I did not get any sense of a powerful woman in her character as one other reviewer did.The film is basically about a lot of disparate characters all trying to hustle each other, from the low-life on the streets to the rich and powerful. Neve, the only one who appears normal and nice in the midst of all this, ends up being as much a manipulator as everyone else around her.No matter what turns you on in movies, I can almost guarantee that this movie will bore you witless. Unfortunatley the rating box wont let me give this one half a star, so I relucantly have to give it a 1."
1,when will I be loved,"I sort of fast forwarded this to look for a plot there was nothing much, but okay for seeing neve campbell in the shower"
3,Interesting yet somewhat strange character study is worth a look,"Typical James Toback fare here: a leisurely story laced with edgy sex in stylish New York living spaces that are just as alluring and sexy as the beautiful bodies. Plusses: a courageously-on-display Neve Campbell, some good exchanges between Ms. Campbell and Dominic Chianese, and a short running time. Minuses mainly consist of several head-scratching moments, including a needless Mike Tyson cameo and a weird tryst in the park. When it's all over, you've gotten enough of a portrait of the Campbell character for the story to work as a character study, though enough of the director's intent remains mysterious enough that the movie ultimately feels like an art-film exercise. So, if you don't have a lot of patience for films with an ambiguous art-house feel, you might want to stay away from this. The DVD extras are somewhat illuminating and interesting."
1,Don't bother with this one.,"This movie blows. I love Neve Campbell and think she is a talented actress and quite beautiful. This was the only reason I bought it. I saw a trailer with her showering and thought that if nothing else I could get a gander at her lovely bod. I wish I had just saved the shower scene and skipped the rest. It tries to be artsy and smart but falls flat. Thank goodness it's not very long, although I was wanting something else to happen to round it out. Neve Campbell is beautiful (has nothing on my wife however); the story so-so and the movie is just a plain old stinker."
4,Too old for sexual awakening,"One thing that surprised me a bit was the notion of ""sexual awakening"" that Vera's boyfriend keeps brining up. Vera looks like she's in her late 20s, waaaay past the point of ""awakening"". She looks like she's been around and seen quite a few things in her life. Her boyfriend understimates her maturity - a mistake that costs him his freedom."
2,??????,"What the hell was this movie all about? The first 45 minutes were good. But that was just the build up... the scenes leading to the final revelation or something like that. The rest of the movie should have been about how it's all tied up/ makes sense. Or, that's what it should have been.... But this movie has one of the most implausible, ridiculous endings I have seen in a long time. The main character's motivations are unconvincing and do not make a lot of sense till the very end.The movie has it's moments though. Some witty lines and some steamy scenes thrown in here and there. But overall, its a just a mess. There's no real plot, to be honest. And did I mention that the title is completely irrelevant?"
1,Who Cares?,"Neve Campbell's character is a cipher, but not an interesting one. One doesn't get any insight into why she does what she does or who she is. And what she does is pretty banal.The whole movie feels like somebody's vanity project, with lots of cameo appearances from B- list celebs. The writer/director appears as a character (always a warning sign of trouble to come) who has a very stilted conversation with Neve Campbell, apparently designed to show us how hip and in touch with her sexuality she is."
1,Hmm must have watched the wrong movie,"It had the same actors and cover as the one everyone else reviewed, but I hated every minute of this movie. It was awful and took about two hours (it seemed like two days) from my life that I will not get back. The entire movie is annoying and I just kept waiting for the credits to roll to put me out of my misery"
1,WHY?,After reading many of the earlier reviews I can only conclude that the reviewers were watched one movie and wrote about another. The movie seemed to be a series of isolated conversations that made no real sense.The back of the DVD case leads you to believe this is a 'smoldering erotic thriller'. I guess the movie is so short (only 81 minuts) because all the eroticism ended up on the cutting room floor. When Will I Be Loved is almost as erotic as a Kermit the Frog cartoon.I recomand this DVD only to people that are planing a lawn party and nave a need for miniature frisbies.One star only because I can not award a lower number.
2,Could have been a good movie,"This movie begans with great promise and quickly dissolves into a incoherent, poorly edited mess. Spoiled rich girl uses her sexuality to get a job, scam an old man out of money and then frames another man for the his death. Pretty much a movie by the numbers. Acting is so so at best and richly deserved to go straight to video rental. Not worth adding to your home collection unless you enjoying seeing Neve Campbell nude."
1,"NOT Exciting, NOT Arousing, NOT A Good Movie","Neve's nude scenes are coy and uninteresting. Neve's love scenes are veiled and unconvincing. To be frank, she's not even beautiful.It's basically a sequel to ""Wild Things,"" but maybe 1/20th as good as ""Wild Things."""
1,The Hollow Ring of Falsely Hip-Sophistication,"An Exercise in ""Look at ME, I make FILMS!"" by Jimmy-Jam TobackA segue from hip-hop to classical is our cue that Toback's sophisticated. Oh, and hip. Remember that.Next, throw in gratuitous cameos; Mike Tyson, Darrel Hannah, Damon Dash... and of course Mr. belly himself, Jimmy-Jam.Add dumb, self-consciously protracted dialog that's supposed to remind all of us commoners how wordly, clever, learned... JJ is. Instead, this self-indulgent piece of doo-doo just rings hollow. What a waste of time.And isn't time THE most valuable thing?This is worse than trying to pass a brick diagonally. Twice."
3,Entertaining!,"First and foremost I am not a film critic. That is not my area of expertise. I read some of the reviews and it appeared some of the viewers were critiquing every scene. I bought a used DVD of When Will I Be Loved because the price was right, and I was hoping the movie was entertaining. I was not disappointed. Now, if you only view flawless movies then you might consider something else."
1,Bad DVD quality,The picture quality is very bad. Very dark and reddish color. Story is very simple and boring. Needs patience to finish the movie. The beauty of Neve Campbell is also not appreciated/presented properly here.
4,It's Christmastime and the family business is going up on the auction block,"Three generations of the Giorgio family have been in the lobster business in Brooklyn. When the bank that had their restaurant renovation loan went under, the FDIC insisted on immediate payment--if not the place goes up for auction.Oh yeah, and it's Christmas.It's a great tale of a long-time family that struggles and survives, keeping their fight, their ingenuity and their sense of humor."
2,"Deep, but BORING","As I watched the movie, I really wanted to like it. I kept hoping something would happen to just make it more interesting. I really liked the subject matter and the conflict, but it was presented in such a non-climactic way that I was bored out of my mind. The acting was good, the directing was good in ways of use of color and background, also maybe symbolism. But like I said, it was just a boring movie. I'm disappointed I chose it. There's nothing in this movie I couldn't have found in another, more entertaining movie."
2,Brooklyn Lobster,"Being a native of Brooklyn, I expected more from this film. It didn't really do anything for me and disappointed me."
3,"Acceptable, but not worthy of its predecessors.","The problem with this book isn't so much about the book. It is pretty much standard sci-fi fare, with a bit of intrigue thrown in for good measure. The problem is, it gets progressively worse, page by page. The break where the children finished the book is stunningly obvious; it is fairly clear that they didn't inherit their fathers talent. If it were on its own, it would be decent, hence the third star. However, when placed at the end of a line of excellent books, it is at best overshadowed, at worst an insult to its predecessors.Starts good, gets bad, has a kiddy break somewhere after that and goes downhill fast. Simply put, if you have never read a Dune book, or if you are a hardcore fan who simply has to know how it ends, then this is a maybe. If you are a softcore fan who just read them because they were interesting at the time, don't waste your energy."
3,"good, but rather slow out of the gate...","Good book. I tried listening to the audio version but the guys voice about drove me crazy, so I decided to read the book instead. :)"
2,The worst of the series,"I liked the first Dune series. Herbert should have stopped there. The last three books are merely a pedestal for Herbert's personal philosophy. While there were kernels of truth to all of the endless philosophical one-liners that everyone spouted, the rest of the novel (an actually well-devised story) was totally ruined by all of this rambling. The books could have been a lot shorter, or those pages could have been better spent developing characters further."
5,The Best of the Dune Books,"For those of you who have never read them, the original Dune series is without equal. Although set in a sci-fi, distant future backdrop, this series is really an exploration of politics, mind altering drugs, power and most importantly, philosophy.Chapterhouse Dune focuses on the most interesting of the various groups from the series - the Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit are a group of women who are astoungingly disciplined; both mentally and physically. They view goals in terms of millenia, not months or years. Although I love the entire Dune series (I've probably read each book at least 10 times in the last 15 years) for me, Chapterhouse Dune is the best. If you have any depth of character or intelligence, you can get something very valuable from this series."
3,Bored with the series,This follows another review I gave...I am bored with the Dune series. I will not order another previous published book of the series...only a first time published book.
1,Morbid and depressing,"Man. What the hell was going on in Herbert's head before he croaked? I'm a big fan of the Dune series (despite Herbert's tendency to covertly glorify islamofascism), but this final volume was HORRIBLE. Not only was it boring, tedious and, quite frankly, poorly written, but none of the protagonists had any shred of decency or redeeming qualities whatsoever. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but Herbert holds these characters up as if they were paragons of virtue.....as if this type of person was the logical and appropriate evolution of the human species. In a word...ick. Toward the end of the book, I started hoping that humanity (his version of humanity) would be wiped out by some cataclysm. Herbert's final book dehumanizes people to the point where life isn't worth living. The whole book goes out of its way to portray wickedness and inhumanity as the way of the superior person, ignoring any attempt to be interesting, entertaining, or even have a plot that makes sense.F-"
2,The Emperor has no clothes,"Chapterhouse: Dune is, in a word, tedious. This book has 20 pages of boring, meaningless pages for every page that actually contributes to the plot. As other reviewers point out, MANY things are left unanswered.The last three books in the Dune series are ploddingly boring.Do yourself a favor, and buy the USED, paperback for a few dollars, DON'T bother paying full price.The books in the Dune: House trilogy on the other hand (by BRIAN Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson), were great. Highly recommended."
3,More closures would have been nice,"The book gives us a better glimpse into the inner sanctums of Bene Gesserits, but I agree with those who felt that the ending wasn't quite satisfactory. I sensed continuing struggles between Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres, and even an impending threat to Murbella from both sides. Also, it was alluded that Sheeana would play a crucial role in the future but never articulated. Same thing goes for Teg, Duncan Idaho, and the last remaining Tleilax Master. I don't think Herbert intended this to be the last of the series."
2,Witches vs. Whores,"Who loses? The reader. This is a surprisingly weak book to follow the brave and bold Heretics of Dune, a novel in which Frank took his ideas further than any reader might have imagined. Only one year elapsed between the release of Heretics and Chapterhouse. Frank may have been trying to capitalize on the success of his Dune franchise by getting another book on the shelf quickly. This reads as though the author had run out of ideas and was playing for time. Very little occurs in the first three-quarters of the novel. Almost all of the action takes place in the final hundred pages of the book, ending in that tantalizing cliffhanger. I think this could have been a much better novel had Frank waited and allowed his ideas sufficient time to germinate, but then again, if he had waited too much longer, Heretics would have been the end of the series. Given the strength of that novel, that may not have been a bad outcome."
4,Chapterhouse Dune Chronicles,The audio book is not quite as good as the book but its pretty close. Fully enjoyed audio presentation. The voice for main character(Darwi Odrade) was outstanding.
2,A weak finish,"After a very slow start, the book draws your interest and really gets moving - resurrecting the spirit of the early books. But it utterly fails in the end. The conclusion is unbelievable, frustratingly open-ended, and poorly written. In the end, Herbert disappoints with weak characters, unforgivable plot holes, and just plain flat out hokiness."
5,Perfect for Brazilians,"This book is exactly what Brazilian students need, and it's the first and only resource I've ever found to address the Brazilian accent in English.For example, it addresses the issue of leaving off final -y sounds on words like ""thirty.""Minimal pairs are presented in sentences to show that the differences in pronunciation completely change the meaning of a sentence."
4,A great book for non-native speakers,"The book starts from clear listening tests which made sense. Introduction to syllable(s) and sound(s) by listening to the CD is very useful, plus the pics show how the lips change when the alphabet vowel sounds are being said."
1,not as good as any other texbook,"I have taken quite a few Pronunciation classes and used different textbooks. This one is not as good as any other books we used in class. The structure of the chapters are not very reasonable and clueless. Too many rules in books conflict with standard rules we learn all along. They may be correct, but obviously confuse people who are not native speakers. And some exercises are not well designed, kind of useless. I won't recommend this book to any non-native English speaker. It is not in the same level of any other textbook in any sense."
4,I found this book very helpful,"I am attending an accent modification class right now and I found this book very helpful. I practice aloud with the audio tapes and I begin to ""hear"" the subtle variations between vowels and similar consonants. This book helps me a lot in improving my speech."
4,A truly impressive intellectual accomplishment,"Richard Tarnas flexes his philosophical and intellectual muscle with this impressive work by managing to render the millenial progress of Western metaphysical thought both concisely and in a form easily accessible to the reader. It is, however, disappointing that his summation of such an important work becomes the ""archetypical"" embodiment of Tarnas' own proposition that, ""Scientists, like everyone else, are attached to their beliefs."" His epilogue expresses a narrow psychodynamic perspective on the post-modern philosophical quest. Although Tarnas' conclusion could have been less myopic and psychodynamically dogmatic, his ability to articulate the overall development of Western thought is to be commended."
2,PC philosophy,"The early parts of the text provide some helpful summary writing. However, this is the cheese used to lure the reader in the mousetrap of politically correct nonsense with which the volume verbosely ends. The book starts as a river, and ends in a scattered and unrelated drain of tributaries. Feminist critique of science (and other fashionable but superficial faddish ""thinking"") is actually taken seriously, while having been rejected by women and men alike who work in the sciences. The author's psychologizing is silly, and is never applied to his own motivations for writing his own text. Like the prisoners in Plato's cave, the author nevers ultimately ascends from the shadow of philosophical prejudice, which covers his work like a shroud."
3,"Informative, but hard to read.","A great account of Western history, but with too many unnecessary words and too many complex sentences. The wording of the book makes it a lot less enjoyable than it should be. I wish I could find a similar book without Tarnas' annoying writing style."
3,Course Requirement,"While it was a good book for the course, I had an extremely hard time following the author. Plus the small print on what feels like millions of pages is not easy on the eyes.."
2,Has more to do with religion than thought,"The book gets bogged down heavily in Christianity. If you think Chistianity has more to do with the lack of thought and ideas than with any reality-based idea itself, you probably won't like this book."
4,An engaging survey of Western thought,"This engaging summary propels readers through the epic story of how Western thought has evolved through the centuries. If you are new to philosophy, you will find that this book gives a lucid overview of subjects ranging from the early Greeks through the evolution of Christian thought, and proceeding onward through the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution to current-day Postmodernism. This book gives many insights on the context underlying current-day views and assumptions about man's place in the universe. If you seek answers to existential questions or religious uncertainties, you may find the Epilogue wanting, but the book as a whole will intrigue you."
5,Read The Book; Skip the Epilogue,"I have just finished the book, and highly recommend it as a readable summary of certain aspects of western philisophy. It is strong in many areas, but weak in its treatment of many others, such as post-modern and contemporary philosophy, and political philosophy.The Epilogue is quite different from the rest of the book, and is an anticlimactic and disappointing ending to an otherwise exemplary work of scholarship. It should not be in the book."
2,Oh dear!,"I have to agree with the more negative reviews. The cover is indeed beautiful, but the content, with exceptions such as Brian Peterson's work, tends towards high heeled black boots and the burlesque. It seems as though fetish is now the order of the day, with erotic photographers following this very standardized path like sheep. Trouble is, the photographs tend to depersonalize and objectify, which robs them of their erotic quality. If making a statement about the objectification of women is the purpose of much of this work, well OK, but how many artists should it take to make the point?A missed opportunity. Take a look at Judy Francesconi's ""Visual Sonnets"" or, from the 1970's, J. Frederick Smith's ""Sappho: The Art of Loving Women"" as alternatives. To me, these speak more of a belief in the beauty and emotional closeness of the relationships depicted in their authors' images."
2,weak,My daughter has brown hair and it didnt take good.She tried many times and got the same result every time
4,Good color.,"In terms of color, I really liked this dye. I have very very dark brown almost black hair, I used this with a 30vol developer, and it made SOME of my hair a nice deep red, a little darker than a fire engine color. I don't know what I did wrong, but the color came out very streaky in my hair and it looked horrible. some parts of my hair were brighter than others, and some parts of my hair underneath looked like they didn't hold any dye at all, like it was still my natural color. If the color would have came out even though, I'm pretty sure I'd have loved it.I've dyed my hair before with box dyes, and thought that using this tube dye with a developer couldn't be that much different. Apparently I was wrong. So if you have no experience with these type of dyes that come in a tube, I don't recommend dyeing it yourself. Also, the dye was quite difficult to squeeze out of the tube."
5,Won't work on hair that has been dyed black,"My roots were red, and my ends were black, lol. I needed to use bleach to lighten my ends. I do plan on using this for my roots, because it will lighten my roots without the need of bleach, and I can then put a rinse on it. Wish it mentioned it in the description, but I took a risk."
3,Quality Varies Wildly,"These stories bundled together in one valume are no doubt great fantasy, is some ways being as ground breaking as Tolkien's work was. However, not all stories are of the same level.The story of Elric of Melnibone was probably the best story in the volume, with a clear plot, beginning and ending and the hero managed to reach closure, of some sort. The other stories were probably intended to underline a principle of some sort, and sadly this was more important than the plot itself.The fantasy itself is superb. The demons, gods, dragons and other supernatural beings inhabiting the stories are among the best ever created, not to mention the scenery itself. However, it must be pointed out the Elirc, the hero of the stories, is getting more depressed from story to story and this will affect the hero.So, in conclusion, great fantasy but not an easy bedtime read."
5,An Experiance with the Anti-Hero,"Being my first adventure with Elric, an incarnation of the Eternal Champion, I was quite perplexed by Moorcocks approach to dark fantasy.This book, Song of the Black Sword, contains three full length original Elric novels with the addition of three short stories that would most definetly become a burden to collect. Just having so much out of print or hard to find literature in one novel is well worth the price alone.The most interesting aspect of these books for myself was not the massive genocide Elric commits with Stormbringer or the bizarre adventures he physically and metaphysically sets foot on , but the strong development of Elric himself.He has changed the way that I view fantasy with such a dark hero."
4,A Hero of a Different Color,"So much has already been written in the excellent reviews here that I will keep this brief. This is my first Michael Moorcock reading and I couldn't put it down. Thoughtful, challenging, and -- in spite of Elric's inclinations toward doom -- not nearly as dark as other books I've read. I highly recommend it."
1,"backing cracks, not waterproof, smaller than stated size","The backing is stiff which severely restricts the blanket's flexibility and the ability to fold it. It's supposed to provide the waterproof barrier, but it cracks after being folded just a couple times, so doesn't even do that. The blanket is more like 60x70 inches, smaller than the 68x82 stated in the description. All around piece of crap!"
1,Terrible product--Don't Buy!!!!,"I bought this mat with high hopes and was thoroughly disappointed!! I followed the washing directions the day that I got it so it would be clean and ready to use for my 8 month old baby. The plastic backing on it is so cheap and brittle that it was completely destroyed in the wash. Big holes all over! Also, extremely difficult to wrap back in the original position to make the shoulder strap work, and when you do, the velcro is not strong enough to keep it closed. Altogether terrible product--- I wish I could get my money back!"
4,"Does the job, easy to transport","I've used this mat several times now, and though it's not very padded it's easily more comfortable than an ordinary blanket or towel. I've used it on inclines and it doesn't slide. It's easy to transport due to the handle and strap. I haven't tried it on wet ground so I can't comment on how waterproof it is, but it's made to fold in a way such that whatever it was on (dirt, etc) won't get on the side you sit on."
3,great blanket but not machine washable,"This is a wonderful picnic blanket: thick, soft, durable, and portable. However, while the directions say that you can put it in the washing machine, you absolutely cannot. Mine completely fell apart. I plan to ask the company for a replacement."
2,Barely there mat,"The backing seems to be waterproof as advertised. The padding is almost non-existent, and it feels flimsy overall. Definitely overpriced."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Notice that when this is folded up, the decorative side is on the OUTSIDE! This means that, when you lay it out to fold it up, you have to put the soft side down on the WET GRASS!! Horrible!!!!"
3,it worked,"Years ago i got this thing for my zaurus 5600. It worked ok, the included stand didnt go so hot, but i could put the zaurus in portrait mode with some software i cant remember what, sit it flat on the table and type ok. Had phenomenal battery life. Now I don't even remember where it is, i'm just writing this review to stop amazon from reminding me.Oh, the one thing that bugged me is that there are a LOT of missing keys, numbers and such are only typeable through button combinations, that's why it's so small. It's a real slower-downer."
1,very bad,"do not, under any circumstances, buy this keyboard. the keyboard itself is beautiful, but the software/driver support is horrible/non-existent."
3,Surprised,"When I picked up the shipping package I heard a rattle inside the box and didn't think anything of it. When I opened the shipping package and then the wooden box I discovered that the rattling sound was comming from a broken part of the box. The box is not great, so much so that it was not worth my time to repackage everything and mail it back. If you purchase this product the knives are great but don't expect much from the cheap wooden box."
4,Look great and nice weight,I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't know the knives were serrated. I thought they would have a smooth edge. Maybe I didn't read the description well enough. The knives look great and work great. They are a wonderful weight and balance. I just prefer non-serrated knives. I bought these as a gift - requested by the gift receiver and they were quite happy.
2,Not very sharp,"I got this set as a wedding gift and the knives feel nice, but do not slice any meat without pulling/tearing it. They will do the job, but my steak knives that came in my $30 Henkel block set work way better. Don't waste your money unless you are buying these for the look"
3,There is a better deal on the 4-pc. sets,"This 8-pc. set looks real nice, but the price when I checked last was $89.99. Amazon has the 4-pc. set, same knives, in a better box on sale for $29.99. Just order two of those. I got mine today and they're beautiful. Haven't used them yet and it will take some time to get used to their slim shape after using clunky steakhouse-type wooden-handle knives, but they look classy. I live in SW Florida and everything down here rusts. We have to buy stainless steel and I love the way these look and feel. I don't keep mine in a box, no storage space, so I don't care what the box looks like. I have magnitized bars attached to the wall behind my stove where I keep all my knives. The boxes that come with the 4-pc. sets, however, are nice aluminum boxes with a fancy latch. I'm going to give them to my grandchildren to store their treasures."
4,"Great Knives, junky box","I received these fantastic knives as a wedding gift in 2008. I love the knives as they are really beautiful I want to wear white cloth gloves with them when I use them because they are so shiney and perfect and I don't want to get my fingerprints on them! They aren't large and aren't clunky, but I always get compliments on them when I have company over. I use them in the dishwasher all the time and they have not lost their finish and beautiful shine at all.5 stars for the knives themselves, but the box they came in is not nice at all and is falling apart after a year and a half of sparce usage. The box is of very low quality so don't expect a nice quality box. But thats probably why this set is so affordable. All in all, 4/5 stars I think is very fair, especially since you get some really nice knives for under a hundred bucks."
4,Shmansy,Nice set of knives. I probably should have purchased a set of $30 steak knives. But I didn't. Oh well. Label me a Wusthof fanboy.
1,Not the same knife set as shown,"I just received the set. The knives are not the same as shown. Instead of the crescent blade, these have a notch at the end. They look exactly like the ones in the Wusthof 4-piece set that doesn't have very good rating. The box hinge is off and one wooden piece inside came off, too, exposing the glue. I am glad I didn't send this gift set to someone, would be embarrassing!"
4,These are very nice; cut steaks very well.,These knives are very nice. My husband has been pleased. Cut meat very easily. Clean up nicely. Overall a very good purchase!
1,A Real Stinker!,"I LOVE Marc Anthony! But this DVD was the worst I have seen/heard in a long time! The production is unimaginative and boring, the audio/video technology is retro, and 4 of the 5 tracks are in Spanish. Not that there is anything wrong with Spanish, but this was not disclosed in the product description nor was the fact that it contained only 5 tracks! What WERE they thinking???"
1,"Very, very BAD!",I like Marc Anthony! But this DVD is very BAD the worst I have seen/heard in a long time! Don't buy!
2,Bootleg looking dvd,I cant belive how bootleg this dvd looks. Looks like i burned it myself. How is it even legal to sell this crap. i LOVE MARC and personally this type of dvd is a disgrase. How dare they bootleg marc
2,Just An Extended TV Episode,"There are two kinds of Star Trek Films...those that genuinely work as full length feature films (Wrath of Khan, First Contact) and those that spread a one hour episode's worth of plot over 100 minutes of time. Nemesis, despite excellent effects and cinematography, and fine performances by the cast, falls into the latter category.Villain with special link to one major character endangers Enterprise. Romulans may or may not responsible. Villain almost triumphs. Enterprise in dire peril. Picard pulls a brilliant last minute strategy out of the hat. Villain perishes on the bridge of his exploding spaceship. (I hope I'm not giving away too much here). Does that sound familiar?"
3,Star Trek: Nemesis,"This movie is ok but not one of the best. I have seen better. Some of the other Star Trek movies were better. I own all of the Star Trek movies made so far on dvd. In ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" the Enterprise is fully restored and a new android appears in the movie so will this be the last Star Trek movie?"
2,Skip this one,"For the general movie fan: this film was made to be edgy, but just comes across as dark and cold; buy ""First Contact"" instead for great Sci-Fi. For Trek fans specifically: the DVD is primarily a cult-of-personality collage on the director and Tom Hardy, neither of whom know or care much about Star Trek."
4,Star Trek Nemesis,"It was truly the best Trek made in the last 10 years. Beside the death of Data, it was filled with action and thank god a good storyline."
1,"Unlike others, I've SEEN this disappointment.","I thought the trailer looked good but unfortunately, our faith in John Logan (Gladiator) was misplaced. I feel sorry for the cast of this film in that they all look so very very tired and worn. It's been three years since the last film yet they look as if they've aged six. I was really hoping that this would be a nice solid film but it's the Next Gen cast trying to be the old cast and it doesn't work, it's boring and it may rank as one of the worst. The previous film, insurrection may ultimately have more going for it this was so ....lame. Time for the film franchise to either get the DS9 team taking over or just call it quits. -Rick Lundeen"
2,A fair film. Less than fair DVD,"The film is okay. Certainly not the best STNG film, but it works.The main thing I was disappointed in was the commentary on the DVD. Ultimate bore. The director is the only one providing commentary. It's quite apparent that he forgets that he's supposed to be providing any commentary. I frequently wondered if he stepped out for coffee. The film volume is not returned during his long pauses, either. Which leaves you with nothing to listen to. Also, he didn't need to whisper. He's not in a crowded theater. The secret to a good commentary track is to have more than one person providing the commentary. They can work off eachother and it becomes far more interesting. They totally missed the boat on this one."
2,The Worst of the NextGen Movies,"Though its production values are excellent, this is easily the worst of the Star Trek Next Generation movies. The story is stupid, even by liberal Star Trek standards, and it contradicts other established story lines. It took four or five novels to fill in the blanks just to make the movie fit into Star Trek lore. It is no wonder the producers and writers of the latest Star Trek movie chose to re-start the entire series' story after this.If you just want to see cool space battles, this is the movie for you. If you are a Star Trek fan, you will be unhappy."
2,The only thing good about this...,"The story and all was horrible. The entire movie just reaked, thanks to the dismembering of the basic ideals of the series by Berman. The ONLY thing I found extremely great about this film was the redesign of the Romulan Warbird.On the merits of the visual effects this movie does stand out. A lot of decent cgi work was done here, and the guys on that crew deserve credit. Though they alone could not save this movie.I think the major problem was the story line and all that. This plot was so horribly flimsy that it could break like celophane on a window. There just wasn't anything remotely approaching interesting here. And adding a THIRD Song-type android was just...THis movie was pretty terrible, and unfortunatly has killed off one of the best movie series ever. Berman has pretty much mutilated and slaughtered this series on all levels. Allas my old friend, I shall miss you."
1,Dissapointing,"The biggest Nemesis here is that Trek has been around so long that is lost steam. Granted the production value of this film is far greater than Final Frontier, or Generations. Ans it was well-written enough that I wasn't physically cringing in the theater the was I was when I saw Insurrection. However, this film was total bore. Only go to see it if you are willing to snooze through a slow-moving, aimless feeling movie that produces no excitment, suprises or emotion. It essentially just relies on the usual Trek trick of recycling old Trek plots and plot devices. This film is a total ""clone"" of Star Trek II, however as we have all learned from science fiction, the clone is never as good as the original. If you really want to see a good Star Trek film, see Star Trek II, the Wrath of Khan. This film was just a lame re-make of that awesome flick. I guess the Trek writers have just run out of ideas and are not excited about the franchise anymore."
3,Seven of 10,"Unfortunately not the greatest Star Trek movie, in fact of the 10 Trek movies i'd rank it #7. There are too many similarities with other movies i.e a madman with a doomsday weapon (see also The Wrath of Khan et al)a main character sacrificing himself (ditto spock in The wrath of Khan), the Enterprise getting beat up (virtualy every film)a countdown to the launch of the weapon (Insurrection, Khan) and so on. A pity and i felt let down. If this is the last Trek movie i won't be sorry.My top 10 Treks:1. The Wrath of Khan2. Final Contact3. The Voyage Home4. The Unknown Country5. Generations6. The Search for Spock7. Nemesis8. Insurrection9. The (slow)Motion Picture10. The Final Frontier"
2,I'll wait for the remake...,"We should all be so lucky. I've been a ST:TNG fan from the beginning, and had to be one of the first to see it. Unfortunately I found myself yawning, looking at my watch, shifting uncomfortably in my seat...I was bored kids!What an unbelievably talky installment, and with so many words, you'd think they might have been able to find something to say. Not the case. :(Some effects were cool, but save your money.Truly an upsetting end for such a great cast. I have to agree with another reviewer's comparison of ""nemesis"" to Dr. Evil."
3,"Finally, A Decent Bad Guy","First Contact was the best Next Generation movie, but this is my favorite Next Generation movie. It's still not great, but I like it a little bit more than the other ones. I think it's because this movie spends a little more time developing the villian than the other movies do.Unfortunately, you can't develop a villian in two hours that will match a cast of heros that were developed over seven years. This film gives it a try though, and doesn't do a bad job. The only problem is, so much screen time is spent developing this villian that not enough time is available to go to the familiar cast we all know and love. It was a no-win situation.Watch this to see what happens. You can watch it again if you want, but don't pay a lot of money to do so."
3,Wrath of Khan all over again?,"As a ST fan I cannot bad mouth much of anything, but I will say that this movie disappointed me. I felt I was watching Wrath of Khan all over again since the story seemed to be very similar. The whole Data story line was weak, and not well thought out. The characters should've been given better development, particularly Dr. Crusher, since this will likely be the end for the Next Gen."
3,Entertaining for Trek Fans,"I passed on this one theatrically, even though I am a die-hard Trekker of many years. I finally got around to seeing it after it was released on DVD, and while I found it very entertaining, I didn't think it was that much moreso than a well-done episode of either TNG or DS9. All in all, I think people who are not into the Trek universe will find it a little weak, and the rest of us will enjoy it for what it is - a fun adventure story with some of our favorite interplanetary heroes."
5,The best Star Trek movie so far!!,"I can't imagine why some people were lukewarm about this movie. Not only were the effects great, but it was one of those rare movies where I couldn't predict what was going to happen next. Especially the ending! Wow. Very very highly recommended."
3,An elongated episode,"Not the best Star Trek TNG film, but good to see the cast together one more time (and it's probably their last). Like the ""Insurrection"" film, it felt like an elongated episode of the series. Of all of the TNG movies, I still think ""First Contact"" was their best. As for ""Nemisis"", good special effects and a few laughs. Sad to see them go, but, as they say, all good things . . . ."
4,Underrated...but needs a re-cut.,"This one is difficult to review. The technical aspects of the Special Collector's Edition are remarkable. A crisp, beautiful widescreen transfer on disc one. Disc two has wonderful, if sad insight into the ""final"" production. The one problem I have is the deleted scenes. Normally 95% of the time I agree with the cuts left on the editing floor. However, there are a couple of crucial scenes that were cut and I think should have remained in the film. I didn't know Beverly was promoted until I saw the deleted scene. Also the deleted scene with Picard and Data discussing life over a glass of wine makes the decisions in the film more acceptable. This is still an underrated, well written film and is a fitting (yet sad) ending for an absolutely fine cast."
5,Awesome,"This is the best of the movies. Great acting. Great plot and story telling. Spoiler alert. It showed how close the main characters get. and i was surprised how much Deanna troy knew about the bridge and the actually ""running"" of the ship."
2,Not very good,I really hate when characters are forced by the plot to do stupid things. The whole concept that on a massive star ship the Captain or First Officer always goes on away missions gets old after a while.
3,Mostly Awful,"I'm not a Trekkie. I didn't like this movie. The action scenes are ridiculously boring and anti-climactic. No motives are really explianed for the villain, and some of the scenes drag on soooooooo long. (I hope you can tell how slowly by how many 'o's I used there.)That being said, I did take one thing from this movie: If Tom Hardy and Patrick Stewart ever decide to just make a movie where they have intense discussions about things of an important nature, I would be so down for that. THe only interesting scenes in this movie were the ones between these too discussing whether or not they really were each other, and what that meant for the other, and their destinies. Yes, that's correct - the only good part of this movie was the heavy dialogue scenes.And the visual effects. Whoever edited the movie slowed it all down too much, but they are still pretty."
1,This movie sucks,I love Star Trek but thought this movie was horrible. The old star treks back in the 80's were better written than this one.
2,What were they thinking???,"I loved this movie the first time I saw it, when it was called THE WRATH OF KHAN! This movie is a complete and utter rip-off of Star Trek II. I had very high hopes for this film and was completely let down. I guess it is ok for a casual Sci-Fi fan but as a Star Trek film it just does not work for me. If you want to see a great sci-fi/Star Trek film go buy Wrath of Khan."
1,Worst Star Trek ever,"At first when I heard there was going to be a movie with Romulans, I was going ""SWEET!""The movie bombs, simple as that. Forget all the little things like Riker breaking his word to only take the Captain's Chair of the Enterprise, even after Enterprise-D was destroyed. Forget the previous peice treaty with the Romulans. It stunk on every level. And I grew up on TNG. They cut off half the main cast, and killed off Data. Ok, so the actor doesnt want to do Star Trek, Hey, after the way that movie stunk, I'll have a heart attack if they make another. But if they leave the slight chance that the entire cast will be there...come onAnd of course the major battle. Two Romulan Warbirds come in to help, and get disabled in SECONDS. Where's the action?If you do get this moive, it's a waste of your time."
1,second worst Trek film ever.,"This laughable rehashing of the Wrath of Kahn features people we used to know and love and now have grown tired and weary of their own legendary status. The embarrassing 18 million dollar opening weekend stated solidly that this is the worst Trek film since #5, the final Frontier. I was a huge fan of the series and I loved First Contact and I really thought this was going to be a powerful last entry in the Trek mythos and yet I got tired dialogue from tired actors who obviously didn't want to be there.The writer, John Logan (co-writer on Gladiator) bragged ahead of time that he had a great idea about #11 and he'd bust up that old track record of the even number films being good ones and odd bad. Well, not to worry, he already busted up THAT record. Don't waste your money."
1,Not Star Trek,"I may not rank too well with this review but this is the bottom line: This film is not Star Trek, it merely has similar characters.I left dejected and weakened; how could someone do this to a franchise?The one star (vs. no stars) fits because it's a very watchable movie for someone who doesn't know anything about the Star Trek universe."
3,Slow in the middle,"I've seen all 10 films; this was one of the best, but it suffered from a slow and talky middle. I actually fell asleep briefly during those segments! And, the story itself is cribbed more than a little from ""Wrath of Khan"". A LOT of similarities. Tom Hardy was not convincing as a Picard clone. Lacked the charisma and gravitas of Patrick Stewart. The Data story was pointless and a distraction from the main story. The look of the film was outstanding. Special effects, set design and makeup were all top-notch and convincing."
3,Really?,"I grew up with TNG. I remember it being a LOT better than this. Oh well, it's still a classic I guess."
3,Lacks depth,"Unlike the other Patrick Stewart Star Trek movies, this movie has the most coherent theme. It, however, fails to penetrate beyond a superficial exploration of the real final frontier, ""self-knowledge."" The movie focuses more on absurd twists and badly done fight sequences than on depth of character and sincere emotion."
3,Glad it was the Last One,"I never cared for the full length movies of the ""Next Generation"" cast but faithfully watch the TV series episodes. They have more scientific,psychological reaction involvement rather than the violent arms shootouts in the movies. The cast of characters in the "" Next Generation"" series have ALWAYS been a tribute to Gene Roddenberry's writings and have stimulated my senses form deep thought to outright laughter."
2,any good Star Trek writers out there???,"Well, Star Trek Insurection was the first nail in the coffin for this tired series. Nemesis was the last nail. I went to see this with high hopes it was better than the last which was basically an episode of the Next Generation. How disappointing that the this was the best the writers could come up with.I liked the character of Shinzon but he was poorly developed.There was no chemistry between the crew members or so it seemed to me. The slap in the face was when they killed Data who became the best character in the series and the only one to hold my interest.The writers seemed to just throw out another ST movie without thinking about a decent storyline and expect fans to accept it.Maybe next time they should try taking more than 20 minutes to write a movie. Oh wait! There wont be a next time!"
3,MEDIOCORE OFFERING FROM A DYING FRANCHISE,"It's too bad. TNG swansong deserved better than a Star Trek walk-through. Known for fx, the fx highlight is Data's flight from point A to point B. Like Spock, in Star Trek: The Motion Picture.Clone? Aren't they supposed to look alike?No ultimate resolution. Talk for talk's sake only. Very dis-apponiting for this ardent Star Trek fan. Save us T'Pol."
3,a weak ending to a great franchise,"I've heard it said that Nemesis was the last of the Next Generation movies (but how many last star trek movies had shatner..). It's a weak ending. The problem is a writer who hasn't written much and a director who is unfamiliar with the franchise and has little experience directing (though a lot of good editing jobs). It's an interesting story that centers around Picard and Data. Riker gets a good action sequence. Troi has a decent role. As does Jordi. But Worf was just overlooked in this film. They touched on all the different series in one way or another. I know that the Star Trek franchise won't end, even if it isn't the Next Generation cast anymore. I just hope that they can make movies better than this one. It's ok, but really only if you are already a fan."
2,The real death of the franchise,"Someday, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga are going to wake up and realize just how lame this movie was. I've read a ton of excuses on why Nemesis did so poorly. I have yet to hear them say ""We made a bad movie."" Enterprise didn't kill Trek (shoot, half the country couldn't watch it, it WAS on UPN); this movie murdered it."
2,Nothing new here,I liked the really dark horrible look of some of this but I was not entertained by the story or anything. It was one of the worst Star Trek movies. Too bad. Everyone seemed tired of it.
2,Worst of all ST movies,I think this movie was the worst of all the Star Trek movies. I have been a ST fan for as long as I remember but this one was a real let down. The story line was stupid and the ending was contrived. It tried to duplicate the feeling everyone got when Spock died. Well it failed miserably!!!
3,Out with a whimper not a bang.,"A Reman raised clone of a young Picard conquers Romulas and seeks to capture his unknowing genetic contributor to complete a DNA transfer that would save him from cellular break down and death but kill Picard.This would have made a better Star Trek: The Next Generation two parter episode but has some nice Trek moments (Riker and Troi marry, Data finds a ""brother""). On par with ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" not ""Star Trek: First Contact"" as far as quality. Unfortunately it's the fact that it would have made a better series entry than a movie that weighs it down. Not really well thought out, predictable except for the end and unfortunately it's a ""what the @&#% were they thinking!?"" as opposed to a ""Wow!"" ending.Mostly disappointing ending to an over a decade long STTNG love affair."
2,Major disappointment,"I have looked forward to this movie for the past year. I read what those involved with the movie said they were trying to accomplish. I thought the plot was a great idea, but the ideas was poorly delivered in this film. It was more ""Star Wars"" than ""Star Trek."" Plus, when the bad guys sneak up on the good guys and are 10 feet away and fire and miss, and this happens over and over in this movie, it takes any sense of realism out of the picture. Plus, the dune buggy sequence is also ridiculous and totally detracts from any sense of real danger or realism. Patrick Stewart is a great actor, but he said in interviews that he had a hard time ""finding"" Picard for this movie. I'm not sure he ever found him. A great disappointment and one of the worst of the Star Trek movies, if not the worst. The ""friction"" between Picard and Shinzon was nothing compared to that between Kirk and Khan. And there are many more disappointments than I will take the time to go into here."
2,maybe the worst of the series,"This movie was just plain stupid. That Shinzon character didn't look anything like Picard, I mean give me a break. Plus the humor was just so cringe-inducing. It literally gave me a stomach ache."
4,Takes a while to warm up,"but when it finally hits you it's like Wrath of Kahn with better acting, and special effects. The early scenes were annoyingly untouching though, and some of the deleted scenes should certainly have stayed in. There was also a deleted scene I read about in an interview with Brent Spiner where Data was teaching his ""brother"" table manners, that should have been included."
3,Not One of the Best,"First of all, the guy who wrote this could not be much of a Next Generation fan. When the duplicate Data is discovered, no mention is made of the possibility that it could be Lor, Data's evil twin brother from the series. Also, what happened to Data's emotion chip? These points could have been brought up later in the film, but I just couldn't sit through the whole thing. The plot was so needlessly complicated(and dull) that I had to go on to more interesting things, like cleaning out my bathtub drain.The main problem I have with this film, and all the Next Generation movies, is the lack of magic and wonder. Unlike the original Trek, the emphasis is on explosions and fancy light shows. I don't know about most of you, but as far as I'm concerned, expensive special effects get really boring really fast. PS, there are too many humanoid aliens. Enough already!!!"
5,Best TNG movie,"I read a review that said this was a clone of Wrath of Kahn. I must disagree. I think it is purposefully meant to mirror Kahn. There are many parallels, but I believe that Nemesis stands by itself. I don't know if there will be any more TNG movies, but this one felt like it was an ending. The one thing that impressed me was the level of emotion in this film. At first, I felt a sad nastalgia as the characters met for a wedding, then I felt nervous as the characters meet the villain. Next came excitement as the action picked up. By the end, I was actually squirming in my seat from the tension. I have never seen a Star Trek movie that has struck my emotions like this. I say bravo to the Star Trek franchise. I hope there are more TNG movies.PS (Do you think we'll ever see movies from the ""Enterprise"" crew?)"
4,intriguing cast,"First, I'm not one of the Trek-hounds who seem to know everything pertinent before the movies are released. I recommend that you take a look at the cast for this one. From the trailers I've seen there's no indication that so many TNG series characters are in this flick... however, they're on the cast list. That's made me even more excited about seeing Nemesis.btw... where's Ambassador Spock? Isn't he supposed to be on Romulus on special assignment, to strengthen ties with the Romulans and influence their culture in a positive manner ?"
4,"Blame the director, not the cast!","This definitely could have been a better Star Trek movie, but it was still enjoyable. I heard Marina Sirtis (the actress who plays Troi) talk about the flaws in this movie. Most important was that the director never saw Star Trek before filming and never saw fit to watch any of it. He wanted to make an action movie, which is what he did. He cut out all the interpersonal relationships which make Trek what it is (check out the deleted scenes!). He even wanted to cut the wedding completely out.That said, the villain was more engaging than the cookie-cutter villains in past TNG films, the special effects were great and the ending was surprisingly touching. Worth the money!"
3,Entertaining,"I bought this on DVD because I had already started to buy the Special Edition 2 disc sets. It's a good film, entertaining, but I have to admit I haven't watched it again yet. That, to me, is a sign that maybe I should have got the VHS version instead. The extras weren't that interesting.Kinda worth it, if your into Trek."
3,resistance is futile,"I liked this movie. Stewart is commanding as always a jean luc-picard. there are some down falls to this. like Data(Brent Spiner) singing songs and other nitbits. Tom Brady(the evil ... Shinzon) is great. lots of cool scenes with superb action. though we will sorely miss Data and this is directed by Stuart Baird people(director of U.S. Marshals, Executive Decision..etc..etc..) and he directs will ease.favorite lineShinzon- ""don't be so vain."""
2,Sub-Par Star Trek Movie,"While better than Insurrection, overall this movie stinks. I would actually give it two and a half stars. This one feels very forced, and while I appreciate the inclusion of the Romulans in a movie, it simply isn't ever convincing that Shinzon would want to destroy Earth. Even with the backstory they do provide, I couldn't believe he wants it that badly. The sudden addition of a new sub-class of Remans is lame. One could write off the coincidence of a race of aliens, just happening to share their name with the mythical founder of Rome. But when all of a sudden we learn of an off-breed of the same race that shares it's name with Romulus' brother Remus it becomes laughable. And perhaps it's a bit cruel, but Brent Spiner has gained weight since the series ended, and it's just odd to see the android Data with a second chin. Sorry, no good."
1,Worst Trek Film Ever,"First off, to the person who had the first posting, it is Commander RIKER, not Ricker. Sound it out. I just saw this film in the theatre. What a wasted two hours. Not enough character development, poor cinematography, and terrible dialogue. And....what was the point of killing Data???? I mean, this film makes Star Trek V look like a gem! Don't waste the time or money. I don't even think I will buy the DVD."
2,Big disappointment,"Being The last of the Trek films, I was very disappointed. Pass this movie up and get wrath of khan."
1,Star Trek Garbage,The title says it all!!I hope that this is indeed the very last Star Trek film ever made!!
3,Better than average Star Trek movie,"On the plus side...Good performances (as always) by Brent Spiner and Patrick Stewart. Fast paced plot, with no meandering subplots. Better than average special effects. Good ending.On the minus side...Not much for the other stars to do except stand around. Quite a number of absurdities (next time Captain Picard decides to ram a Romulan warship head-on he should remind the crew to fasten their seatbelts).The biggest problem for me was the bad guys just weren't bad enough. Considering how the Enterprise destroyed the Borg almost single-handedly, it's hard to take a pack of Romulan-Reman renegades seriously. Maybe that's why the Next Gen movies are ultimately disappointing: it's tough to top the TV episodes!"
5,What is everyone talking about?,"What is everyone talking about? This is a great Star Trek film. I have always been a Star Trek fan, and I see nothing wrong with this film. The story is fine, and the acting is wonderful and the action is awesome. But one negative thing, is the lack of supporting roles. We don't see much of Drodi, or Dr. Crusher. And another thing, this should not have ended the series. We need one more movie with the Next Generation crew."
1,The worst of all.,"After a long wait to see the Romulans in a Star Trek movie theyappear on the tenth movie as the good guys who helped Captain Picard. On the other hand, the bad guy in none other than Cap.Picard himself as his clone. By the way, he looked more like a clone of Kojak than Picard, what a shame!The plot is so full of flaws and so illogical that sometimes I think that Mr.Rick Bermann take the fans as stupid people. It is the worst Star Trek movie ever and I hope it is the last because I can't stand this disrespect towards Gene Roddenberry's legacy."
5,Great film,"Stop trashing this film it is great. I love the enterprise battle and the story is good. Also, as for a clone that looks like him, they are being realistic about it, the looks of a person are shaped by events not only by genetics. So, just leave this film alone."
2,An Improvement Over Insurrection But That's Not Saying Much!,This movie was like a big overblown STNG episode. I enjoyed it as long as I kept my brain turned off. Patrick Stewart was wonderful as Captain Picard but it seems like he was just going through the motions to get a paycheck. He is a capable actor and his talents were wasted on this film. The deleted scenes would've actually made the movie a lot better if they were included. Shinzon was not as effective a villian as Kahn no matter what Berman says! Shinzon seemed like some rushed into production character added to the Star Trek universe just for this movie. The Romulans would never have allowed the Remans to take over the Romulan Senate I mean it would be the same as The Borg being defeated by a horde of Jawas or the efforts of one federation captain (i.e. Voyager) which I thought was just as ridiculous. But we needed a movie to include the Romulans so they came up with this garbage! What a travesty!
3,This was no 'First Contact !',"I had expected more from the crew of the New Generation. I thought that the storyline was interesting, but did not endear itself to the audience. Patrick and crew put in an admirable performance despite their weak and sometimes pathetic dialogue. I thought that we would be treated to something great for their last effort together. I guess that this shows we can all be wrong sometimes. I hope that we will see them together at least one more time; so we can be treated to something more perfect. The television New Generation out does most of what we have seen on the big screen. Although this thought does not include ""First Contact,"" which is by far their most perfect endeavor. It is although worth a rental, so that you can be judge and jury for yourself. You are really your best and most trustworthy critic."
4,A Generation's final Journey....,"I would have to say I am a Star Trek Voyager fan, and I favor the Voyager sereis out of the whole Trek genre. And I also keep up to date with the Next Generation crew and their movies. I would have to say Star Trek Nemesis is a huge improvement over Star Trek First Contact and Star Trek Insurrection. But it did not surprass Star Trek Generations. I do not like how the Borg are depicted in the Next Generation. I always saw them as Janeway's enemy, not Picards, so that's why I was dissapointed in First Contact. Perhaps one of my favorite parts of the film was the cameo appearance of Admiral Janeway (Voyager's former Captain) who gave Captain Picard his orders. This is an enjoyable film, loaded with action. But I would have to say it's time for the Next Generation crew to really move on, and so that's what this film depicted. If they do make another Trek film it should defintely feature a Deep Space Nine crew or the former Voyagers."
3,Nothing much to it.,"Want to have a few laughs,watching the antics of characters you know and love? Grab this movie. Want an intelligent sci-fi flick with interesting things to say about identity and cloning? For Gossakes go elsewhere. The triteness is unbelievably thick on the ground. The other good points would be the ambience and special effects,which are good,and the design for the new ship,which is amazing."
4,Great Action and Great Story,"...this movie is great stuff.The last two STNG films ""First Contact"" and ""Insurrection""were good put lacked something here and there.This new film has it all, drama, action, suspense.If you are a long time follower of STNG, there is no wayyou could be disappointed by this film."
2,Whither Star Trek?,"When watching this film at the theater I almost walked out. It really seamed not to be a Star Trek film and certainly not one of the Star Trek The Next Generation films. Something there is missing, the now classic characters seemed bored and very boring. As with Generations I didn't care for the lighting which gives the Federation ship a very dark look. The film was promotted as the film with the vilian as good as Kahn, should be because he was a carbon copy. When are they going to just release a good story that doesn't have a vilian?"
1,So this is what it's come to...,"I am completely dumbfounded by the existence of this movie. Rick Berman has finally succeeded in detroying a beloved franchise. The Next Generation was often an entertaining, if not thought-provoking series about the issues that face humanity, even in a futuristic setting. But the succession of terrible motion pictures is almost the polar opposite of Kirk and Crew, who had a campy show, but respectable movies.I once heard there is nothing more desperate and hopelessly optimistic than a Cubs fan. But watching these movies, I have to think that anyone who wishes more than uninspired nonsense from the Trek camp is worse."
4,"Not the best, but a superb sign-off","I was wondering what to expect when John Logan wrote and Stuart Baird took over directing for the Star Trek franchise, but I was not disappointed. Baird brought a new visual style to this movie (ex. extensive panel closeups, lots of camera motion during the battle sequences) that made it like you were in the movie and not just a spectator. This movie had the best battle sequence since the Wrath of Khan. I wasn't disappointed."
2,So and so... run of the milll,"AVERAGe in every department: plot, acting, special effects. YOu'll get absolutey nothing more than average quality to this picture.It's not bad, but I forgot about it as soon as I walked out from the theater, contrary to other films in the series."
1,Star Trek at its worst (hopefully).....,"I'm not going to be too harsh, but honestly, it could have been better. This is only the third star Trek movie I have seen, and out of all three it is definately the worst.It just seemed so....cheesy. Especially the ending. None of the characters came across as very real, unlike the ones in the old movies (with Kirk, Spock, etc.)If you're considering seeing this movie, I advise you, for the love of God DON'T! See the old ones first, and then if you're courageous try to make it through this one without falling asleep."
1,HORRIBLE for fans and non trek fans alike,"When it's not boring it's ridiculous. This film not only has no respect for the established facts of the Star Trek universe, it has no respect for the viewer! It's as if the fools Bragga and Berman (the producers of this failed enterprise, pun intended) assume the viewer has never seen another movie, and will therefore actually be intrigued by this cliche', predictable, and pendantic plot.Don't waste your time."
1,Definitely the worst ST film,"I have been watching ST since the late 60s. Every TV show, every movie, read most of the books, etc. I know these characters. This movie was just plain BAD. The writing was disjointed, the lighting was horrible, and there was none of the inside humor that made all of the best ST shows and films as good as they were. This film has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's especially unfortunate that it appears to be the last ST film for the forseeable future. One final note: I don't get the comparisons to ST II and ST III that some of the other reviewers have made. Those were actually pretty good films, II being one of the best. This was just a sad mess, and all those currently in charge of overseeing the ST franchise should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Last Days of Glory,Star Treks days of glory have come to an end. STAR TREK - NEMESIS may be the final cinematic chapter the STAR TREK Next Generation crew. Interestingly this is a dark and somewhat bleak looking film involving the Romulans. The film is actually good but the pessimistic atmosphere leaves one yearning for the glory days of STAR TREK be they the old or next generation. Jerry Goldsmith's final Star Trek score is outstanding and one of his best.
4,One of the best Star Trek Movies,"Nemesis was a very well scripted event. Not as good as First Contact, but still very good. I was a little dissapointed that they killed Data, but they brought him back in another form. If they make another movie it will be interesting ot se how B4 develops and assumes data's identity. Tom Hardy and Patrick Stewart did excellent job's portraying there characters. I wish the other members of the Enterprise had more involved roles and sub plots. I think with that many members of a crew the movie should have been longer and more involved. But all in all it was a good movie. I think it only did poorly at the Box Office due to it's release so close to Lord Of The Rings."
1,I'd rather watch an episode of Voyager(!),"I am a huge star trek fan, and this is the worst star trek film ever, I promise. As I said in the title of my review, I would rather suffer through a first season episode of Voyager than watch this tripe again. Horribly written, with zero regard for continuity or the consistency of characters, this ranks as a horrible film in all aspects. I like Insurrection a thousand times more than this film, and Insurrection was no great shakes. Avoid this film, it's a complete waste of time. I guarantee!"
2,Dull and dated,"Next generation? More like last generation, or your father's generation. I fell asleep midway through this movie, and by the time I came to it was the same old concluding space battle, shields losing power with perfect dramatic timing. The enemy looked like Dr. Evil and seemed about as menacing."
1,The Last Was The Worst,"The Remans - a race that has built the ultimate weapon - a biogenic device so dangerous that it destroys life instantly - decided to position it 15 feet behind the captain's chair on the enemy ship with no guards, force fields or shielding? You're telling me that all one has to do is walk on the bridge and shoot the weapon with a phaser and you'll blow up the ship? This movie is so full of stupidity that it makes Star Trek V look like Citizen Kane. The writers are ruining this franchise. Chimpanzees wrote a script for the most intelligent fan base in the world."
3,Disappointed Star Trek Fan,"First off, I've got to say I'm a huge Star Trek fan. However, this is probably the first ST movie I've ever really been disappointed with. I mean, ok... there was 5 with the god thing and everything, but... I've loved STNG especially. I've never thought they threw up an airbal until this one. I agree with all reviewers about stale ideas, etc... Why didn't Berman ever take the next logical step??? Its like the idiots with the Alien franchise. Why didn't the Aliens ever make it to earth??? Same goes here. Why didn't the Borg make it earth, ala the Wolf 357 tv episode??? Or, if Deep Space 9 was along the same time line, why didn't the Dominion make it to earth??? I know some people will say they did that in First Contact, but that's NOT the same thing, nor is it what First Contact was all about. I just hope they get some new ideas and make better movies. If not, I guess there will always be the hope of a Star Gate SG-1 movie!!!"
2,Inconsistent Trek downhill,"Since this was the first time I watched a Trek movie in the cinema, I had my hopes up. Good sound and picture would be awaiting me. Well, after finishing the movie that's almost all I got. The story was bad, the bad guy was bad, the inconsistencies were really really bad, the special FX were mediocre. In the FX department it all looked nice but another mano a mano and ship to ship battle was simple too simple. Star Wars overkills in this department but this movie underkills (is that a word :). What were those beach buggies doing there.I could keep going, but you probably read some of the other reviews. It's a repetition of ST2 but without any link to the TNG universe. This movie rates just above the worst TNG episode ever ""Shades Of Grey"". I am disappointed in the way Trek is going.I've been a fan for many years and I hope Rick Berman gets a kick in the head so his nuts come down. Let's have some balls in the Trek universe and get something new."
4,OUT WITH A BANG,"Nemesis is a darker trek but yet still maintains the Star Trek spirt. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat for the last 40 minutes, and it ends with a bang. If this is the end of the TNG crew their will no disopointments, hopefully not thoe. However I do think it is time for DS9 film! It does lack the Undiscover Country sighing off at the end but the producer had no idea this would have been the next TNG movie. Nemesis has action, humor, romance, suspense and action again!"
3,PARAMOUNT RAPED THE ORIGINAL ENDING,I AM A AVID STAR TREK FAN AND I WAS REALLY DISAPOINTED TO SEE THAT THE DVD VERSION WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE THEATRE VERSION. THERE WAS A HUGE BATTLE SEEN THAT WAS CUT FROM THE DVD VERSION AND I ENJOYED WATCHING IT BUT IT WAS A DISAPOINTMENT ON THE ENDING.
1,"Star Wars, I mean Trek- Attack of the Clones- I mean Nemesis","Oh Whatever! I saw this movie last night and it was sooo bad. The special effects. The ridiculously executed plot, which had potentintial for good but was just bad, bad, bad.... I wanted very badly to sleep through it, but it was too hard in the movie theater seats."
2,Old and Weak,"What is it with destroying the Enterprise in the TNG franchise? They seem to treat her like a damn Yugo: cheap and easily replaceable. Borrowing liberally from its own past, this film demonstrates how tired the franchise has become. Not that we're tired of the characters, but they obviously need new direction. There is no spirit of discovery left. Berman and company have bled the turnip dry. At least with the TOS films there seemed to be a desire to move the characters forward, despite the obvious and necessary commercial ambitions of the movies. Berman seems content with just holding a record for spin-offs. They tried to make this their Star Trek II with a black hat villain and heroic sacrifice in the end, but there's no emotional connection. It's all too fantastic to believe."
3,Devo eye candy,"No wonder it's the final journey: we've conquered the 7 wonders of the technological world, but it's still ""men"" who go to battle, send there by that cheese-grater voice of Captain Janeway. And gender is still a viable construct, with Data, the man-made male machine with no genetalia, going out with a big bang in the end. Hope it was good for him. It was just okay for me."
1,The worst Movie of an already bad set for TNG,"You have to be kidding me.None of TNG movies have been very good, but this was the worst by far.Can you say low low budget.I fell asleep."
4,Runs like a two hour TV special,"If you are looking for an epical film you will be dissapointed (Try the Two Towers).I saw the movie the other day and it was not that bad. But this film looks basically much like a two hour star trek special you would see on TV, but that is not a bad thing. But I really hoped that they would make an epical film. Plus if you did not watch the Tv series then you will hate this movie.CAUTION SPOILERSOne more thing the way this movie ended shocked me. It is worth a lookSPOILERS ENDSo if you are a Star Trek Fan than you will like this film if you are not a fan then you will hate this film.Hopes this review helped"
3,All that it needed was a better director,"The good; outstanding visual effects provided by Digital Domain, an engrossing and well thought out story by John Logan, and the acting performances of Patrick Stuart, Brent Spiner, and Tom Hardy (Hardy's portrayal of Shinzon is brilliant!)The bad; and it's a whopper... Stuart Baird should be making commercials, not feature films. Given his poor track record (""Air Force One"" and ""U.S. Marshalls"" are tedious films) Baird seems to have only read the script when he needed to shoot a scene, disregarding the story. Bairds use (or lack thereof) of the marvelous sets and lighting provided by the ol' TNG group is nothing short of appalling. One only needs to look at the scenes in the Romulan Senate and the bridge of Shinzon's flagship to understand the true lack of talant and vision provided by Baird."
2,ST2 + ST3 = ST X,"Go gack and watch Wrath of Khan and Search for Spock then watch Nemesis. The plot is parts of each. Weapon of mass destruction like in ST2, Enterprise too damaged to get away, sacrifice of Data(Spock), and then a resurrection of Data(B-5) as a blank slate ala Spock in ST3."
1,A shame to the Star Trek series,"In a manner similar to the Star Trek : Enterprise TV series, this movie managed to disappoint most Star Trek fans and did not fair well in the Box Office. This is the one Star Trek Movie I will never purchase."
4,Good but not great.,"This final outing of the 'next generation' crew is one of the better films in the franchise but not the best.On the plus side it offers some excellent action scenes and SFX and we finally get to see the enigmatic Remans who are being led by a clone of Picard. A lot of the story threads that have continued throughout the T.V. series and prior films are also tied up, such as Deanna and Will Riker finally marrying, Riker getting a command etc.However, the film is not perfect. Data discovers a 'brother' on another planet but there is no indication of why/how he get there and this thread is never fully explored. Picard's clone seems obsessed with Deanna at one point...why??This film works on a pure entertainment level but don't expect any complexity in it. It is like a marshmallow...a lot of bulk but not a lot of substance."
2,Tragic waste of talent,"Weak story packed with hackneyed, cheap plot devices, shallow character development...but the biggest crime this movie commits is the tragic mismanagement of Tom Hardy. He's forced into the role of a flimsy villain with a shiny cape, horrendously misdirected and stifled. Watch any of his other movies, definitely check out his audition on youtube for this film, and compare. Tragic waste of talent."
1,"The worst of all the Star Trek movies, by far.","So bad that I cannot bother to spend the time writing a lengthy review about all that was hoaky and silly about this movie. The rubber masks, the pathetic boring banter between the principle characters, and the cliche all black dark of the evil Romulans ... all of whom are horrible ugly monsters ... except the star of this movie who is a clone of Jean-Luc Picard, and coincidentally head of the Romulan Empire. Oh the silliness abounds, not to mention the search for Data's ""brother"" who is a decoy Manchurian Candidate so to speak. I have a hard time even trying to think of an episode of any of the Star Trek television shows that comes close to being as bad as this movie. 1/10 ... should be lower."
3,Not as bad as I remember,Could have been worse. Could have been better. I don't really think that killing Data was the best way to go here.
3,"Not the best, not the worse either","StarTrek Nemesis is said to be the last film of the Next Generation cast. I think that's a shame because it would be am unworthy ending the series. I liked the film but it could of been better. The whole thing with Picard having a clone was silly, wasn't explained that well how he got cloned either. Date has a brother android that looks just like him and it's not explained too well where he came from either. What the film has going for is the special effects, action and the performances of Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner. The under-rated StarTrek First Contact is a much better film and the best of the next generation movies. If they couldn't of done better than that they shouldn't of made more Next Generation movies. That should of been the last one."
2,"Oh, dear.",Continuity is abused and The Wrath of Khan is ripped off in the ten installment of the Star Trek movie franchise. There are a few good lines of dialogue but it's probably best avoided altogether.
2,missed chance for movie,"I'm a late bloomer trekie fan. Within the past 4 four years I really got into the Star Trek world (I'm a die hard TNG,DS9, & VGY fan). I also just buying most of the movies.I looked forward to Nemesis mainly because of the Romulan angle. To me, they are the most intresting group that never received their full due in any movie.I felt that the plot was very weak and was ok for a one time viewing. I know with all the great stories on the shows that someone could have written a better movie.I hope the upcoming movie is alot better."
2,Bad Bad film,"I am not sure what they hell they were thinking with this movie, but the only thing I can say is its better than Insurrection, of course if you have seen Insurrection you would know that isn't saying much.This movie and Insurrection all but killed the Star Trek movie franchise, with a reboot film now in production hopefully it will redeem this historic sci fi series.If you are looking for a good Star Trek film try part 2 The Wrath of Kahn, the best of the films, though most of the ones with the original crew are good. The best of the TNG crew is First Contact, though Generations is worth a look.As a completist I will likely at some point buy this film, but for other people I do not recommend this film at all."
3,A returned gift?,Sent this as a gift and I believe it was returned.What does that say about this disc??? I liked the movie but it wasn't the greatest.
3,All Successful Series Must Ruin In A Sequel!,"I can't say the story was good but this movie had a very good opening! the main weakness of the movie was It's visuals. Visuals and CGs were as good as a TV production, not better! and second weakness was Shinzon! at least they could create more intresting character. well, it's a rule! all successful series must ruin in a sequel and Star Treck Nemesis, ruind the next generation series success! But, honestly, it's not that bad as some say!If you have all of the Star Treck movies, it'll be good if you buy this dvd for you collection too. It's full of special features and worth. but buying this dvd individually for personal uses or as a gift, seems not to be a good idea!"
4,Fitting final chapter,"Star Trek Nemesis does a good job of wrapping up the film saga of, if not the Star Trek franchise, but at least the Next Generation characters. The movie adds some of the action that some of the films have been missing (the space battle between the Reman warship and the Enterprise-E was very impressive).In fact, just having the Romulans and Remans being the big baddies for this movie is a great change, as none of the previous Trek films have used the Romulans as the main villains. Even with STVI, while the Romulans were part of the evil plot, they weren't running the show. Nemesis makes for a nice change.I greatly enjoyed Star Trek: Nemesis, and reccomend it heartily to Star Trek fans young and old alike."
1,Prime Suspect,"This movie is a cheap-looking travesty, with low-energy performances, pointless digressions, and tedious 'action' scenes. Witness the fact that it effectively killed the Next Gen movie franchise, and resoundingly terminated the 'odd/even' pattern of quality. Yecch."
2,"Poor script, old cast",I love star trek and this movie lacks the excitement of the Star Trek franchise. The movie itself is single-minded and the actors are showing their age.
4,"Exciting, nonstop action, great Tom Hardy",I don't know what people are complaining about. Watching Patrick Stewart and Tom Hardy in hand to hand combat is pretty good stuff. And the ending is unexpected and moving.
3,Not the best,"This was not quite what I would call the best Star Trek movie. It is said that they are supposed to be up against the most deadly apponent ever in a Star Trek film. I fail to see this. Jar Jar Binks would have been a more worthy apponent than this guy. This Shinzon fella better be glad that he wasn't up against Kirk, because the movie would've only been about 5 minutes long. Shinzon would've been dead after the first minute, and the last 4 minutes would be Kirk, Spock, and McCoy talking about how much of a joke Shinzon was. There are a number of scenes that (if you're familiar with them) you can tell were taken from the other movies. So to put it plainly, I would call it an average Star Trek movie. But I would recomend ""The Voyage Home"" or ""The Undiscovered Country"" over this one any day."
3,"Good special effects, ok plot.","A lot of action for a Star Trek movie, but not much of a plot. I for one found the Romulans to be too friendly. Last time I watched Star Trek (and granted, that's been awhile) the Romulans were vicious bloodthirsty warriors who took no prisoners. Instead we get Picard offering to buy a female Romulan a drink as they come to the aid of the battered Enterprise? (Hope that little nugget of info didn't ruin anything for anybody) Sorry, just not buying the story.While we're at it, let's throw in a new data android, a vicious new starship which doesn't get used to it's full potential and takes 11 minutes to warm up it's big gun, and a new villain leader of the Romulans ...... who's not even Romulan. He's a humanoid clone? Sorry, too much reaching for a plot here took away from the the fantastic special effects sequence."
2,"Nemesis: Earnest, But Disappointing","It has been twenty-three years since the first Star Trek film was released, and its most stylish villains - the Romulans - finally have their turn. It's fitting that John Logan (one of the screenwriters of Gladiator) wrote this installment - albeit with some meddling by Brent Spiner.Unfortunately, as with so much recent Star Trek fare, the execution is earnest but poor; production design is insipid, the vistas generally colorless, editing is awkward. Spiner has also pulled a Sigourney Weaver - using his input to give himself a heroic sendoff.Compared to Star Wars, one expects some cheapness in Star Trek visuals, yet painted backdrops and redressed sets just don't meet today's standards.Don't expect to see Riker's new command, the Titan, either.Nevertheless, Star Trek loyalists will remember the series' better days, swallow hard, and buy this product."
2,ok,"Basically the item came at the last possible moment. Also the item I got was supposed to be a widescreen dvd. That is what the case even said when we got it. ... It ended up being a full screen dvd, which was not what we wanted, but its not worth shipping to return it!"
2,A Sad Farewell,"Sadly, this last production in the 40 year long original ""Star Trek"" continuity turned out to be nothing more than a poor man's remake of ""Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan"", seen through the bland prism of the already bloodless Next Generation cast. An unfortunately low note on which to go out, and the only true financial flop in the film franchise.So far anyway."
4,MediaGab Review,Star Trek Nemesis is the tenth movie but only the fourth movie with the next generation crew. The crew is on their way to the home world of Counselor Troy to attend the wedding of Commander Riker and Troy when then get side tracked into investigating what their sensor pick up as a positronic being on another world. They then get invited to Romulus for talks.Turns out it is all a ploy and the real reasons are uncovered by the crew. At this point all hell breaks loose.The story line of the movie is very well done. But I think that the challenge of this adversary as challenging as say the Borg. The movie is very action packed but for being the last next generation movie I think that it could of ended it with a real challenge.
2,director,"I think the director was terrible in doing this, and was very disappointed, Johnathon Frakes should have done it, he knows how star trek should be..."
2,boring formulatic,I was disappointed in the predictable plot - twists and turns were a yawn. Special effects were routine. Characters boring.
3,Nemesis Delivers but Not Flawless,"As an avid Trek fan, of course I had to make the movie! Nemesis is probably the darkest Trek of them all but it could have been better. There were too many holes to allow me to give a full five stars such as: why put Wesley Crusher and Guinan in the wedding scene to never show them again (very brief cameo)? The story lines didn't always transition smoothly; the development of Picard's clone could have been done more effectively; etc.However, the movie was entertaining, particularly for Trekkies. A few friends went with me that are not Trekkies and they thought it was ""okay"" but nothing earth-shattering.Go see the movie or get it when it comes out on DVD - I'll certainly add it to my collection."
4,Out on a high note,This is quite possible the best Trek film since The Undiscovered Country. If you enjoy the franchise then you will definately want to see this film. I have been waiting for Star Trek to get back to dark and dramatic story telling and stop trying to be funny. I'm glad they did it before they retired this crew.
4,Something of a Departure for Next Generation,"This installment played for me much better on the small screen where the action sequences (which are a little exaggerated and maybe a tad gratuitous) don't overshadow and undercut the relationships and storyline for which I've always felt TNG excelled.Some have conerns about the storyline. I thought it was good enough to hold up the characters and I loved Tom Hardy as the evil Praetor Shinzon. He was a physically and mentally impressive and a capable ""nemesis"" to our beloved Captain Picard.Hardy takes away valuable screen time from some of our usual TNG characters, and the performances of Dr. Crusher and even Deanna seem perfunctory at best. I grew weary of Deanna's uncharacteristically sad, tear-stained face.Overall, it's a great TNG romp through the evil underbelly of the unknown and a showcase for good versus evil as well as Captail Picard and Data. Definitely worth seeing and a worthy film for your collection."
5,Take it For What It is Worth...,"I have been a fan of Star Trek since early childhood, and I was sad in VI when we finally said goodbye to Kirk and Co. And I admit, it took me awhile (Season 3 of TNG: ""Best of Both Worlds"")to warm-up to the TNG gang. With this film, I would have to say that it is the finest film to feature TNG, and I am sad to see them go as well. I am not a fan of the other series, so this is an ending for me as well. Thank God for DVD's, so I can revisit friends whenever I want to. Nemesis truly looks like a film and not an extended TV show: dark, edgy, and although predictable, somewhat magical. The Enterprise E (my favorite part of the TNG films) looks as mighty as ever, and I am glad that they finally showed what she can do. The characters are alive and well, and I feel that this film was badly underrated. If you are a fan like me, just enjoy it and take it for what it is worth."
1,A Sign of Things To Come,"The Star Trek franchise temporarily died after this movie was released. This happened for a good reason and I wish it had stayed that way. Nememis emulated TWOK too much and relied on a week Romulan villain with a really big ship. I am so glad Star Trek 2009 was nothing like this film (sarcasm).Data's death was stupid and at that point I really didn't care. If there had been a sequel, he would have came back in B-4. Thus, the Wrath of Khan like Nemesis would have been followed by a movie similar to The Search for Spock. Lame!"
3,"It has it's flaws, but hey, it's Trek, man!","While I was tempted to get the new box set that that was coming out of all the TNG films leading up to the new film's release on DVD, when you're on a budget you go with what you can afford. Besides I already had the first 7 films in the same style packaging so I didn't wanna mess that up. So I went the bargain route and got the original Special Editions of the TNG films to round out my collection and I couldn't be happier to finally have the full collection. Granted, the box for my copy of ""Nemesis"" is a little beat up, but the content plays okay, so I can't complain since it only cost me like 3 bucks plus shipping.If you're a trek fan like me and on a budget and just can't dive into Blu-Ray yet, check out Amazon and try to get your hands on these special edition 2 disc dvds. The bonus features are great and even make re-watching Star Trek V worth it. :-)-Eli"
1,"Worse than ""Star Trek the Motion Picture""","This movie proves than money can't buy everything. It had some decent special effects but no decent storyline or dialog. At the beginning of the movie, we find Picard standing on an alien planet with Data-like android parts scattered in 4 or 5 places - an arm here, a leg there, and a head somewhere else. Picard says ""Something isn't right about this."" Really, Jean-Luke? What was your first clue? I think the disembodied android was a metaphor of the movie to come. The rest of the movie was just as disjointed and never came together. Maybe the android was in one piece before the editors started whacking away."
2,Easily the worst of all the Star Trek movies,"I'm a Star Trek fan, and of all the movies, this one is the only one that really HAD to be hyped. Even the Star Trek movies that aren't the greatest (traditionally, the odd numbered ones) have some merit to them. This movie, is horrid, with it's contrived sequences, that propel it's story to...more contrived sequences. This movie is the reason why Star Trek had to take a break, not the last show, because it was getting a whole lot better, story wise than some of the other series. this movie killed Star Trek...I blame Rick Berman."
4,Nemisis...,"I've read a few of the reviews on Star Trek - Nemesis. I've seen the movie on cable several times. I like this movie enough that I'm going to purchase the ""Special Collector's Edition"" at a good price. As much of a fan of both the Original ""Star Trek"" and, of course, ""Star Trek, the Next Generation"" series that I am, I am not forgetting that their original premise is to entertain. I find the acting good and the Graphics/Special effects very, very good! Could they have made improvements? Certainly! This is just science fiction, folks. Not real life! Try to remember that, please? My rating: Four stars!"
1,If you like to explore music you have to take the dross with the class,and this was old time music hall singalong dross
3,"Not a good set, not a bad set","I bought these a few years ago just to have a set in the kitchen. I have used a few of the knives but not all of them. Generally, I have used the steak knives and a few others when I make a beef stew. I haven't had a problem with rust, though. However, although they are fairly sharp, they do cut like you are using a hack saw most of the time. If you're cutting steak, they're ok.....if you're cutting a tomato, they're not so good. I'm ready to move up to a set you have to sharpen."
1,In a word....TERRIBLE!,"My parents have a set of Chicago cutlery that they got for their wedding decades ago, and it's still a great set for them. I bought this set as a starter set until I could upgrade to a better Chicago cutlery set, but I'll never buy another Chicago cutlery set. The chef's knife rusted after a week. Now three months later, their all rusted. The serrated edge is dull and doesn't cut, it tears. If your thinking of buying this set, regardless of price you would better served spending your money elsewhere."
1,Cannot recommend,"These are probably some of the worst knives I have tried using. Their serrated edge means that they tear whatever you are cutting, and they stick to the chopping board (if you are using a wooden chopping board). They are unpredictable and rear off in unexpected directions meaning it's virtually impossible to cut straight and you have to watch your fingers. I wouldn't recommend these knives to anyone."
3,Periods of excellent writing and reticence,I bought this book due to the author's being a poet thinking that only a poet could best write of great war and trench experience. The quality of writing is very good with passages of excellence. An area of frustration was his reticence of his own experiences. Two of special note was failing to mention how he earned the military cross (possibly this was not to be covered in this book) and another was the landing of a dud artillery round near him with no personal reaction.
3,"Not too many good bands, Crippled Nation is the best on here","most of the bands on here should stay underground but there are a few which display a good amount of talent like crippled nation and godbelow, the cd is worth buying if u are interested in underground metal, even though i wouldnt call all of the music on here metal...... watch out for crippled nation in the future though... these guys have alot of talent and will definately make it big by the lucky record label who decides to sign them"
3,Wore out quickly,"The gloves served their purpose while they lasted, but they were lightweight and wore out relatively quickly, a little faster than other gloves of the same ilk. They are quite comfortable, though, and fit nicely."
4,Awesome!,"I chose the rating of 4 stars only because the item does have some spots that feel like if they encountered hard work they crack and tear in a second, besides that they feel great and can handle the light work, and are decent for parkouring, i do recommend that what ever size of glove you know you wear, that you get one size bigger, so that the velcro straps close to where there is no extra to hang off on your wrist, because after a while it will agitate them"
4,Good gloves but watch the size!,"The Harbinger Power Stretchback Gloves arrived quickly...good because I lost yet another set of gloves at the gym.I consider myself to have small hands. My dominant hand circumference measures 8 inches which, according to [...] is a ""small"" hand in a male. But large is the perfect size in these gloves for me. If the fit was any tighter it wouldn't be acceptable.The palms are comfortably padded. I didn't notice any obnoxious odor from them nor did they stain my hands. After a few hours of use, I find them to be perfectly suited to their intended task. My reason for only 4 stars is a concern over the size issue."
1,one major flaw,"i wonder if they do quality control on these gloves. they're great until you put on the velcro straps. When you move your wrists backwards they dig into your skin and hurts A LOT. just try benching in theses, you'll regret it right away"
3,"Low price, average performance","The price of these gloves is low for a reason. The padding is VERY light. If you are looking for gloves to lift any kind of heavy weights, get the more expensive gloves with extra/gel padding or your hands will be hurting. These gloves are made for the exercise that is light on your hands. So wear them when working out your biceps or triceps, NOT your back or even chest!!! They do allow some air in so they don't get as hot as other [more padded] Harbinger models. I have them as a spare for the ""light on the hands"" workouts."
3,it works i guess....,"The gloves have adequate padding and do the job but are not the greatest. The suede leather is nice for grip, but the right glove was nice suede, and the left was a very ""worn"" suede... On the right glove the backing for the velcro wasn't cut quite right and some of the stiff ""hook"" velcro pokes into your skin while lifting. this is more of an annoyance than anything. the left glove just looks ""worn"" and some stitching looks loose, it feels nice and broke in, but it also feels significantly looser than the right hand glove... I ordered a large according to their sizing chart and they are both a touch loose, perhaps i should have ordered a medium.. but i also ordered a pro flexclosure pair in large and they fit just right.Perhaps i got a lemon pair. Overall i rate them OK"
5,Comfortable and Great Fitting,The grips are perfect and the sizing is very accurate. Took the strain on my skin out of bar work.
3,measurement,"I found out i was not a medium, i wore someone else's and it was a small.you might want to go down a size of what you actually are.These are great, just if it had accurate measurements"
4,Harbinger Power STrech Goves,Good Gloves for the price I paid. Good quality for my 20 year old son. I would recommend it. I have boughtg a few from other dealers but they broke fast.
4,Nice glove,"Overall I found this glove to be pretty good - however lacks a strong wrist support though. But for the price, this glove solves its purpose pretty nicely."
4,so so for sailing gloves,"I bought these because they were extremely low priced and I needed some sailing gloves fast. They aren't for sailing, but they work fairly well. You will still get tears further up on your fingers as they don't cover past the first joint, but they have adequate leather-ish padding for the palm and first knuckle. Overall, for the price, they work for sailing in a pinch."
5,Harbinger gloves,These were bought for a wheelchair user and served their purpose well. Very reliable shipping information too.
5,Work-Out,Good work-out gloves for the price. Unable to assess durability as haven't used long enough.
3,Meh,"If you do workout or weight lifting twice every month I guess they're ok, I use them 3 times a week at least, and after 2 or 3 weeks the outside part of the hand (where the 2 fabrics met), the stiches got weak fast and now theres a hole on the side of my hand, on each hand, they are confortable and the size chart is really usefull and accurate, the wrist part is kinda loose or not tight enough, and I would have liked a little bit of wrist support, and the inside part of the fingers (at the end) is always bending to the inside du to the different material they used not a big problem tho, the palm material is really good and confortable, and really prevents your hand getting messed up to the weights, overall they're ok"
5,Snug and Comfortable,"Starting my new years resolution a month late, and needed something to protect my hands from getting cut when using power tools and the like. The palms are leather and the other side is a mesh that breathes air very well. I used the online sizing chart and they fit perfect. A+ Recommended."
3,Good product for a low price,"Good product, but do not look like the picture posted. The mark does not go above the glove, but in a internal label. They are made &#8203;&#8203;in China"
2,Rip too easily,"I've gone through multiple workout gloves from harbinger in the past several years and have to say that these gloves are of poorest quality. First of all, the length of the fingers and thumb weren't sewn for universal use. This creates a small ridge right in the middle of your palm which creates a pressure point when lifting, and when you're bench pressing a lot of weight, you definitely feel the irritation. The second thing I noticed with these gloves is that they tear way too easily. I've only had them for about one month and I already have tears on the pinky side of both gloves. They obviously weren't constructed to last and I now i know I should've just payed more for higher quality gloves."
2,"Good fit, but not much protection","These gloves fit good and look good, but not much protection for the palm. I end up with constant calluses, despite wearing these gloves for every workout. I recommend spending the extra few dollars and go up in quality."
2,Cheaply made. Not a great fit.,"I find these gloves very uncomfortable - the bottom side of the velcro straps have a very sharp edge that almost cuts into my skin and causes much discomfort. I have had to resort to putting tape across the strap edges to dull the edge, but the discomfort remains. I'd return these if it didn't end up costing more than the gloves. You get what you pay for."
2,If the glove fits...,"Received these and was disappointed with the detail tailoring - the tailoring around the finger openings is loose/sloppy. This allows the material to gather or bunch and can be uncomfortable.I ordered the Large based on other reviews - but I think if you measure your hand correctly, the sizing will be accurate.The final straw for me was the oversized velcro closure on the back - so large it digs into the wrist when you fold your hand up - I can't use these, they are a return for something else."
3,OK for amateur lifters,"I bought these gloves less than a year ago and at first I thought they were a good bang for your buck. I lift 4-6 times a week so I get good use out of them. I don't see it as an overuse problem seeing how I am using them for their specific purpose. They fell apart first at the fingers, then at the palm on both gloves. I purchased a Size Large and I did not feel a size problem, just poor craftsmanship by Harbinger. Usually a good company for lifting products but not in this case."
3,"Worked great, but","Pros:ComfortableProtects my hands while using heavy dumbbellsCons:A seam tore after less than 2 months of normal use. Will patch it up, hopefully it works fine after that."
3,Size chart is off and Velcro is uncomfortable,Purchased these bassed on price point. The gloves work decent however I throught I would need large based on dissing chart when really I needed a medium. Also the Velcro irritates my wrist while lifting. This could be due to having small wrists. Overall wish I would have gone with a higher end pair I use these as backup gloves now
5,Totally worth it!,Excellent value for the money. Does its job. Has a rough feeling to it. I guess that's the way its supposed to be.Make sure you order the correct size. Luckily i did.
3,Needs more pads on the palm area....,"I don't know if it is my hands that has a defect or the gloves. It does not seem to be a pair for the size if significantly different. The right is very loose and the left is about right. Needs additional pads on the palm area, just a bit more. If I may suggest that the velcro snaps should be elastic for better fit on the wrist area."
4,Takes some time to work off the stiffness,It took me about three months to work off the stiffness. In the beginning the pair I had hurt every time i used them. I started to get calluses in the spots that wouldn't flex. Once I got the stiffness out and the material became soft and pliable they were great.
3,Fingers way too short,"The gloves are good for the price, but my fingers are way too long for it. I had to opt for a small cause while I have smaller hands, my fingers are disproportionally long. I guess it was my fault. Shoulda opted for one with 3/4 fingers"
3,Get what you pay for,"These may be good gloves for the casual weightlifter but you if you depend on wrist support to lift heavy weight this glove is useless. There is absolutely NO wrist support AT ALL. Other than that, the glove works fine."
3,Decent gloves. Harbinger makes better,"I dont hate them, nothing special. I've purchased better harbinger gloves in the past though. these are pretty simple, no wrist support."
1,Two left handed gloves,I just wanted a basic lifting glove so decided to give these a try. When I went to put the gloves on I realized they sent me two left handed gloves....which does me no good. Since they are cheap it's not worth my time to send them back. I will just order a different pair form a different company.
3,"Good quality, but can be straps can be abrasive","I bought this pair to replace an older pair of Harbinger gloves that were falling apart after 2 years of heavy use. I decided to this pair because it was slightly cheaper. Although the grip on this product is fine, and the material seems quite durable the straps that secure the gloves to your hands/wrists frequently scratch against my hands causing irritation/rashes. It's nothing major -- I can (and still do) use them on a daily basis, but I have to be more careful about how tightly I secure the straps and where I secure them.Even though this product is fine, I would still recommend the other Harbinger gloves (the 143's). They were more comfortable and offered the same grip/durability."
3,status of this article,good morning gentlemen I would like to know what has happened with this item because the purchase was effective and deducted from my credit card and appears as submitted and therefore post I wonder if there are any problems with it.above all a cordial greeting.D:. L:.
3,Not best gloves,"I gave it 3 stars because the glove sIze was inaccurate , and the gloves don't help with pull-ups. They do have a great feel to them make sure you order a size above your expectation."
4,Great Glove,These gloves can not be beat for the money! Great value and a great glove that perform well and fit even better.
3,Decent Gloves,"Not that I have anything to compare them to really, but they do the job just fine. I'd recommend them."
4,good quality,"I like the quality of this glove, however, I thought the small would be a good size for my hands and the extra small probably would have fit better. The finger holes run just a smidge bigger than the chart recommends. They are awesome, though, and I still use them even if they are slightly too large."
5,Good fit,It arrived on time. The quality is top notch and the fitting is great. It was never uncomfortable even when doing bench presses.
3,Harbinger Power StretchBack Glove,"Harbinger Power StretchBack Glove is an average workout glove with the grip, padding protection, and the life of the glove."
5,"Wow, these gloves are amazing.","Forget supplements, you just need these gloves!I put these gloves on before lifting each time, and now I'm stacked. I didn't even increase my weight!On top of that, all the callouses that were on my hands are now off. I've got the smoothest skin this side of the Mississippi now, believe me, it's been confirmed.Take it from me, if you're looking for a way to cheat the system and look like a roided out freak, but don't want to spend money on the roids, or possibly fail a drug test or hit your wife? Buy these gloves. They are a godsend."
1,bulky and painful,Thee gloves ar at best uncomfortable and difficult to use but are likely to also be painful to use. Literally. They are not well designed or tailored. There is excess fabric around almost all the fingers when using them which wraps around the fingers and causes indentations and consistent pain. Just not a good product. Really isn't worth the savings by getting what seems to be bargain set of gloves.
2,Palm has already ripped on the right hand.,"I used these for work and about after a month, the padding on the right hand pad has already ripped. Nice and light weight but a bit on the cheap side."
4,Got what I wanted. Thin gloves.,"I purchased these locally on sale for 9 dollars and was able to try them on before buying so I got the right size and do not have any issues with the velcro. I also did not want heavily padded gloves which is why I bought this pair. If you want heavily padded gloves these are not them. I bought them to get through P90x so they have been used with dumbbells and for pullups and they made it just fine with little to no signs of wear in the palm.They are however somewhat poorly constructed. I had to take a needle and thread to them in a couple of places where stitching was coming out on the back side of the glove. The material was intact, but the stitching was not properly tied off or something so it just unraveled. -1 star for that, but for the price they are fine gloves."
2,Keep looking,These gloves are not exactly what I was hoping. They fit snug but there is to much padding on them. It binds up while benching pressing and is very uncomfortable. I would suggest you keep looking and don't settle on this pair.
5,Extremely Satisfied (So Far),"I purchased these gloves in January and have been using them 3 times a week since they arrived at my door step. You can't expect fantastic things when you spend less then 10 dollars, but these do exactly what they were designed for. They are great quality especially for the price. I no longer have calluses on my hands from lifting which was the main reason I bought them.I recall other people complaining about the Velcro and how it irritated their skin. I have no issue with this, so don't be deterred by their experience.As of right now they are still holding up strong and have not torn or worn down (knock on wood). I only go to the gym three times a week so maybe for more frequent lifters, you might need a more expensive glove. For my use they are perfect. Although I am curious to see how long they will last. I will update my review when they start to go downhill."
5,Great,I received the gloves on time and they are comfortable to wear. As much as I use them they are still in very good condition. I would recommend this product!
2,I've had better for the money,"My criticism of these gloves is that the leather bunches up creating painful ridges when lifting heavy, especially around the fingers. I've been lifting for decades. These aren't terrible gloves, but I've certainly had better."
3,Could Use More Padding,"These gloves are comfortable, but could use more padding. Overall a decent value for the money."
1,Lack of Durability,"I work out pretty frequently, but this particular item has been by far the shortest lived pair of gloves I have ever owned. The lower palm of the hand is comprised of paper thin leather, and ripped after about 3 weeks use."
3,Don't buy the size concerns,"Good gloves. Not the best I've seen. Harbinger 143 are far superior and cheaper. Regarding the gloves, I read a lot of complaints regarding the sizing before I purchased these and I believed them and bought one size larger (up'd from med to large). Big Mistake. The Gloves were loose and uncomfortable. I ended up giving them to my brother. They're decent gloves, but Harbinger has far better gloves for less."
1,Two different sizes?,"I just received the gloves and the left hand is one full size smaller (and believe me, my hands are the same size... I don't have the problem of having one hand being bigger than the other). Both gloves have a tag inside that say they are both M size, but the left is uncomfortably smaller. My best theory is that the warehouse some how accidentally attached a M-size-label to the left hand glove. Now what am I supposed to do with half a pair of gloves?"
5,Second Pair.,"I lost a glove from my first pair and since they were exceptional, I ordered another pair!Great quality, fit, and feel!"
3,Mediocre quality,"Even though they look so good in the picture, the gloves feel a lot cheap in real life. I use them to lift 25-50 lbs dumbbells and they start feeling uncomfortable as the weight increases. I think these would be more suitable for low weights (5-35 lbs)."
4,wheel chair bound,"These gloves are great for your hands if you are in a manual wheel chair. Good protection and grip for starting,wheeling and stopping!!!!They might be a little tight so a large might be x-tra large for a man or a woman if she has big fingers and hands. Price is right but if shipping charge high might not be worth it. They work for me."
3,okay gloves,I've been working out in the gym forever and recently started doing some more heavy weights. the chaffs on my hands started to become annoying so I decided to try gloves again. These are okay. I didn't find them super comfortable or uncomfortable. I ended up using straps with heavier weights which rendered the gloves useless and I ended up returning them for a refund.
2,It isn't my size,"Buy these gloves size S because others had used the same make and fit me very well, but these fit me wide at the top"
2,Only OK,"These are only OK gloves. They will work fine for occasional use, but are not very well made and mine fell apart after heavy use. The stitching on the index finger was the first place to give.Also, these take absolutely forever to dry out when they get wet."
2,"Looks nice, but uncomfortable",Even though the look of the gloves is appealing they are very uncomfortable to wear
4,Comfortable gloves that are a great value!,"I do basic weight training 3x a week along with my cardio workout and needed something to keep my hands from getting killed. These gloves are exactly what I was looking for. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's true that they don't offer wrist support, but they are well-built and comfortable. I gave these gloves 4 stars only because I thought they could have used a little more padding. However, for the price I paid they are a great value for the money!"
4,good for beginners,I think this is quite good for beginners. It protects the hand adequately (though there is not much in terms of padding) and is relatively inexpensive. I use it all the time - it doesnt cover up whole of the palm (I mean the other side of it) - isnt bulky and thats what I like about it. Not sure if this will be of any help to the serious powerlifters.
1,Just call me Lefty,"I ordered these for my son's friend for Christmas.. much to my embarrassment he returned them to me, after he went to go work out. He brought them over to my house and told me to try on the gloves... I put on the first glove, the left one.. I went to put on the other glove to find out it was also a left handed glove. I guess you get what you pay for. The $7.00 wasn't worth re-boxing them, going to the post office and waiting for another pair.. I just drove to the Sports store and got him a new set.. Left & Right!"
5,A Phenomenal and fortunate find.,The first and greatest of American pianists demonstrates his capabilites in a searing rendition of Pictures. The Copland sonata is down with a devastating conviction and drive. A must have for Kapell fans.(and that's with a 'K')
4,From the cover,"From the book:This book is a solid scholarly contribution to the introductory college level study of the New Testament. It not only provides the essential content of each book of the New Testament together with the basic scholarly issues of introduction and interpretation but also through the judicious use of sidebars, pictures, maps, charts, and diagrams informs the reader on the historical, cultural, and sociological context of the New Testament writings. --M. Robert Mulholland Jr."
4,Nice little package,"I reference six different English translations and the Greek during my Bible study. The NASB and ESV (English Standard Version) are consistently, I feel, the most accurate translations. They maintain a literal translation while being easy to read. FOr a personal study Bible, I would recommend the ESV. But the NASB would be my second choice.But that isn't even what this review is about. It is supposed to be about this little pocket version in particular. I like it. I did give it four stars because the cover is not very protective of the pages. I have a little New King James Version that I was given by the Gideon's and it's cover is much more protective. But still I take this little guy to school every day with me and it holds up. There are so many different Bible styles out there. Don't buy this one for study or anything, but if you want a Bible to carry in your pocket to work or school, this is a good one."
5,Best English Translation in a wonderful package,"Many of today's translations fail to place accuracy as a high priority. Thankfully, the NASB puts a premium on literal translation, and now with their update, make it easier to read (no ""Thee"" or ""Thou"" simply because it is addressing God). And for when compactness is essential, this small NT plus Psalms and Proverbs proves very handy. Highly recommended. For more on the biblical translation issue, see Ralph Martin's ""Accuracy of Translation."""
2,nmew american standard New Textment,I thought I orded a full size book and found that I ordered a 1/4 size so I was disapointed.
1,Space Saver but Poor Quality,"I DO NOT recommend. I don't typically write reviews unless it's really bad. I bought this last year to save on counter space. The block is however, coming apart at the seam right through the Wusthof name. Wusthof do not stand by this product ... I expected something of better quality and it didn't meet up to standards."
3,small slots,"I installed this product today then set about filling it with knives. My largest chef's knife will not slide into any of the slots; the largest slots are still too narrow. My sharpening steel will fit, but it's wide handle blocks the slots below, rendering it useless. I'm a bit disappointed. Great concept and well built. Could be engineered better."
3,It's okay,We are so excited to have this product...didn't have any problems with the positioning under the cabinet. It has cracked in two spots...I would recommend it tho for anyone looking for more counter space.
5,Great knife storage,"What an excellent idea. Easy to install, and all my knives fit in it. We received the knife block quickly, and was impressed with how easy it was to install. It looks great under our cabinet and is easy to get to. It's so nice having our knives at our reach, instead of digging in a drawer, or having a bigger block on the cabinet taking up needed space."
3,Make your own???,"OK, so why not just make your own??? All you need is your old knife block and old lazy-susan hardware. It took me about 15 minutes to make mine with items that I did not have to buy. Come on, guys. This is an easy kitchen project."
2,Leans - looks bad,"Because the swivel attachment piece is not centered on the wood block - the block leans - the block is not on plane with the floor/counter top. When the block it turned sideways to get the knife handles out of your face, so to speak, it is really noticeable. When the handles are facing you the handles are tilted a bit to the ceiling. Very annoying to look at but functionally it is a good space saver and very convenient."
1,Not so hot,"I bought one of these years ago and it has served me very well. However the current product is not the same. First of all the product is not made with any quality. The wood is green and the glue joints separate so badly that my son, who is a woodworker, said there was no way he could fix the last one I bought. Then we get to the knife slots. There is not one slot wide enough for a normal size chef's knife, basic to any knife set. The sharpening steel slot, which on my old block is on the bottom row, is on the top row of slots and, as every steel has a hanger ring, that falls in front of the knife slot below it. For a company as well know as Wusthof it is a disgrace. I sent a letter with photos to Wusthof USA to which I received no reply. Shame on Wusthof!"
1,Nice finish but doesn't fit,"This knife block has a very nice finish, however it doesn't fit under any standard cabinet. The block that mounts to the underside of your cabinet is about 1"" too thin to allow the block to swing out as it is designed. Also, the template does not match the mounting holes in the swivel block, and the screws are not the right length. I am returning mine for a refund.Also of note - the block holds the knife in place by magnets that can scratch/mark the blades of your fine cutlery when you pull the knife out or slide it in.Altogether, this is a non-starter. Yes, I could modify it and make it work but when you pay this kind of a price for a block of wood with slots in it you shouldn't have to re-manufacture it to make it work."
3,Cracked in 5 places the first week,"Like the design--but make sure to inspect the block for cracks.There was one small crack in this block when I received it. I didn't notice it at the time. After a week, four additional large cracks had opened at the right side of the block where the different pieces of wood are joined."
5,Great product,"Wow... Easy installation, looks great under the cabinet and freed up counter space. To bad it doesn't have a space to put the scissors that my knife block had. Love it..."
5,"This is the 2nd one I bought, it's the only way to store knives.",Frees up drawer space and swings out of sight. I bought this one for our second home where drawer space is limited.
2,Good block but mounting difficulties,"I gave this a 2 and returned it because I did not realize that I had to drill holes through the cabinet and secure it with screws from inside the cabinet to mount it. Also the shelves inside my cabinet are not removable, without a right angle drill attachment it is impossible to countersink the holes from inside the cabinet for the flat head mounting screws to be flush with the bottom on the cabinet.The storage block itself appears to be well made and would solve the problem of not cluttering up the kitchen counter."
3,Perfect for clearing off the block.,"I had a big old knife block taking up space in my kitchen. Limited drawers meant I couldn't put my knives in there. Small hands in my kitchen meant I couldn't put them on a magnetic rack. So, since apparently only one company has the ability to make a product like this, I bought this one. I truly love it. It mounted easily (the people who say it is hard to install are idiots. Follow the template, measure twice drill once and bingo!) The one drawback is the fact that even though there are slots on both sides the knives will only be held by the magnets on one side. They haven't come flying out, nor do I expect them to, but the way my kitchen is set up having them come out the other side would have been awkward so I wish they had thought of me when designing it.You hear that Wusthof? I am angry you didn't send a designer to look at my kitchen and see how your product would affect me personally,"
4,Great space saving knife storage,"I bought this knife holder to keep my kitchen knives in a convenient place that didn't take up drawer space. It swivels for easy access to the knives. Although difficult to install for a non-handy person such as myself, it was well worth the effort.The sharpening steel slot was not necessary for my use, otherwise a great item that I like a lot."
3,Longevity issues,"Bought this about 4 years ago to house a slowly growing knife collection. It was the only under-cabinet option at the time. Long story short: it is a very clever idea, and it does a great job keeping your knives safe and out of sight until needed. Fatal flaw is that the ball-bearing swivel wears out over time. Would I buy another? yes, but I really wish they had mounted the swivel dead center in the knife block in order to minimize the rotating diameter of the block and the levered forces on the swivel mechanism. Thank God it is on sale now. Perhaps it is being phased out?"
4,Exactly what i needed,"I have been looking for an under the counter knife block for a very long time and was ecstatic to fond this blockPro: Functional with a sleek design. Easy to install, easy to use. Horizontal storage of knifes is ideal to prevent wear on the cutting surfaces.Cons: The diagram used to drill wholes was off by 2 mm for 1 hole. For my cabinet, I needed an in between size screw (I guess they cannot have hardware for everyone). I bought from amazon and they claimed it would ship in about a week; it took a month.This is an outstanding space saver, and it brings your knifes to a very covenant height for use. I highly recommend for every from cooks to chefs."
5,good performance for the price!,I have wondows XP on my desktop. Installation was easy as per the instructions in mannuial. I have had this up andd running since last night. My router Netgear MR814v2 is 2 walls away from my desktop and I still get ~85% signal strength and > 90% signal quality. I have 128 bit WEP truned on and it is working great.I think this is the best bargain that you could get for this price range. ...Just a note on compatibility with MR814v2. If you are planning to use this with Netgear's MR814v2. Make sure you have firmware version 5.01 for the MR814v2. Mine came with version 5.00 and I spent 3 frustrating days figuring out the problem. I finally downloaded latest firmware verrsion 5.01 from Nergear's site for MR814v2 and since then connection is as good as it can be!!
4,"Very Good ""Wireless PCI Adapter""","I've this Wireless Adapter for about 3 1/2 years now, works great never had any problems, very easy to installed very reliable. I read some of the priors reviews for this Wireless Adapter, and there's only one review that, I agreed with. If you are looking to buy one, buy this one."
2,It failed after 4-5 months,I spent many hours tring to connect my computer to the wirless router. I could not figure it out. Electronic cards going bad was the last thing I would suspect but I was not correct. The Card 1024 was my problem and I don't recommend buying one. I know electonics and this card failed me where other have not.
2,Ad Hoc not working consistently,"While I thought this card was a good buy for [$$]..., I am having a lot of difficulty getting it to work with 2 other 1024 adapters, 1 internal and 1 external USB."
5,Silly People,"I decided to buy the card because Im not the richest person in the world againts all advice in this column, anyone looking at these reviews really need to know that the people who wrote the other reviews were apparently operating on half the brain.This card took about 5 minutes to set up, how hard was it to download a driver, double click it and then let the device manager install it. After you install the driver the computer will say ""New Hardware found"" Run the wizard and you'll be all set. As soon as it was done with the wizard it recognized a wireless connection and I was on the internet in approximately five minutes from start to finish.The only thing lacking from this card is it is 11mps but well, Im not going to need more than that.I advise buying it if your looking for a bargain."
1,Siemens SpeedStream Wireless PCI evaluation,"The driver for the SpeedStream could be installed. However during installation the default settings are shown (e.g., channel 11), but you can't change them. I couldn't find the file to edit. When you bringup the SpeedSteam Wireless LAN Utility the icon does not appear in the system tray. I also couldn't use browser to access www.speedstream.com -- ""The connection was refused when attempting to contact www.speedstream.com"".I use to have a Microsoft wireless adapter, but it died so I wanted to try out Siemens. Big mistake. I have PC with Windows 2000 Professional. So I just use the 10/100 ethernet instead.Look elsewhere if you want a wireless connection."
4,Excellent entry level sub value,"I owned this sub for a year or so after becoming frustrated getting a down firing (higher end) subwoofer to sound right in a large, rather odd-shaped room. Having the rear port and being able to control its reflections to ideally tweak the phasing with larger mains was my reasoning behind this selection.This is a very satisfying subwoofer, although bass extension isn't spectacular and it produces a fair amount of port noise on the lowest notes. It's a great sub for music and excellent for the money, and a definite step up from integrated home theater subs. Unless you push this sub too far (and produce a lot of port chuffing) or you really know what truly deep bass extension feels like, you will be completely happy with this sub--especially for the price. The 10"" driver is also reflective of the price, having a foam surround vs a more durable rubber one."
3,1st sub for me,This my first sub i purchased it because of the reviews. I play in a live band so I hear real Bass a lot. I haven't used it for movies yet. Judging by the sound it is probably better for movie watching. I have found this sub does provide very low sub tones/sound but they don't sound real or like a natural band. There is nothing like big powerful vintage systems for music. Hopefully this will work better for movies cheers J
2,It's not what you think,I have one of these sitting in a closet somewhere or did my wife throw it out. This thing stopped working after light use in about 6 months. Velodyne is a respected name in the subwoofer industry but this thing does not cut it . Good velodyne subs cost a grand and then some. Quality control is sacrificed on the cheaper models. Also the power rating is misleading. Your sub has to be able to handle more than 100 watts especially when paired with a good quality amp. Don't buy it because of the name. If you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that specialize in that category. Velodyne won't get another dime of mine.
2,Good Sub if your wife won't let you get a real Sub Woofer,"I'll make this short and sweet. If you want deep bass do not waste your money on the 10"". Do yourself a big favor and go for the 12"" woofers. You will be much happier. ."
3,Great for the money!,"Most of the reviews I've read on this product I would agree with. It's perfect for a non audiophile person or family whose interested in getting an ""experience"" of what subwoofers can do for movies and music. It can be improved, slightly, by adding spikes to the bottom and a good interconnect. The difference between this and more expensive subs is better clarity, extension and distinction of bass instruments and sounds. All in all, though, a good safe choice and a bargin at the price."
5,Large Room with a Large Boom!,"I was quite concerned about comparing money versus ""boom"", but after finally making the choice after a lot of research I was extreamly please to hear and feel the sound that came out of the Velodyne VX-10. I have it connected to a new Sony DG 1000 Receiver(same as the high end ES 3000!!!), also highly recommended after tons of research comparing, just ask my wife. All said and done this sub clearly filled my 20 x 30 Living/kitchen room with tight booming bass that every human should have in their house.Upside: inexpensive, great tight bass, and compact size.Downside: no LFE input, I used the LFE from the Sony into one of the RCA inputs, and it works fine."
1,"save your money, piece of junk","I give this one star because you can't give it a no star. It doesn't work. No base at all. I have a pioneer elite VSX82TXS and this sub produces zero base. I've had two Yamahas and they worked. Stupid me, this was cheap, I bought it and well, you get what you pay for. I hope I can get Amzaon to take it back, a real piece of cr_p"
1,Disappointed,"Does not fit 1/2 ton 88' chevy van, pins to long & bushings to big. Even all the auto parts stores I checked out said this was the right item, but it is not. Did not want to drill out hinges for bushings to fit, so I bought the variety pack, which has the correct bushings. Then cut pins to size. I guess that's part of the thrill in restoring an older vehicle."
1,Findley's agenda gets in the way.,"Why Paul Findley hates Israel is not clear. What is clear is that he has written a book with lies from the Arab world.The U.S.-Israeli Relationship is the only democratic relationship in the middle east. Let's respect it, not attack it."
5,Deliberate Deceptions,"An outstanding book in explaning who is controlling US policy in the Middle East.Paul tells you the facts and nothing but the facts.....this is a book that is worth reading if you are wondering what is happening in US politics and who is controlling what is going on inside and outside America.You should also consider reading ""The Holocaust Industry"" by Norman Finkelstein. This book will shed more light on why this country in heading in the direction that is not in the best interest of America."
5,very well researched.,"Once you start you can't stop. No matter what anyone says about this book being slightly unbalanced, one thing remains true. And that truth is that Mr. Findly gives a reference to every single claim and fact that he makes. A book is only as good as how well it is researched and if the author gives references to check his own work then it is in this context that true academic scholarship is presented. Two thumbs up. Bravo. I can never look at the Arab/Israeli conflict in the same light again. If you think Paul fundly is lying all you have to do is read his well documented sources. It almost seemed as if there was a reference in every sentence of the book. A must read to all political science students. Also shown is the nature of Israels apartheid regime and the complacency of our government to allow this."
3,Watch tool,Nice tool; a little akward to use. Two of the bits or tips were not in the pack. Heavy duty will remove the most stuborn backs.
1,Watch case opener,I wouldn't buy this unless you're positive you have a watch case it'll open. It didn't open any of mine. A waste of my money.
2,"Um...instructions, please?",I'm sure this is good stuff. It would be really nice if it came w/instructions. Of any kind. I see a HUGE market here for someone to sell instructions for $5.00 or so and make a mint...
4,Good Info,I checked this book out of the library. I'm almost finished and I've found that it is full of good information for those concerned about memory loss. It is the only book I've read on the subject so I can't compare it to any others. It is easy to read.
5,Protect Your Mind Now!,"Watched two of my ladies siblings go through dementia, one advanced to Alzheimer's, and now my lady is showing many of the dementia symptoms. This book is a tool to use to help you and yours mental cognition.The insidious nature of these diseases surprise you. If you or someone you love is having memory problems---get the book, study and apply what you learn...please....you will not regret doing so."
5,"Age-Proof Your Mind : Detect, Delay, and Prevent Memory Loss--Before It's Too Late",The subject matter became an interest of our family because my mother-in-law was diagnosed with Alzheimers. My wife and I are in our mid-fifties and we wanted to get scientific data on any preventative measures.Dr. Tan did an excellent job covering this debilitating disease-in a way anyone could understand the data and preventative measures recommended.It was an excellent read and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a level of knowledge to where they can adjust their current lifestyle to better prevent this disease.
2,Terrible headphones,"I've had these for a little while, and there horrible. Buy something else. My reasons: The sound quality isn't as good as most headphones out their, the sound sounds muffled with too much bass, also there extremely uncomfortable. It feels like my ears are suffocating or something. its hard to describe. If you need a new pair, u should steer away from these."
1,I Hate These Headphones!,"I bought these Sony headphones after my old ones broke, they were also from Sony but a different model and I had them for years and I liked them a lot more then this model because the sound quality was a lot better. These newer headphones may be more comfortable and more attactive looking but the sound is not all that great! In the beginning they were good for listening to one of those books recorded on tape and though I at first I thought the headphones were okay for music I then became very disappointed with poor sound quality which is too low, goes in and out and is really annoying and I think I will have to find some new headphones with better sound quality. The fluctuating sound level isn't as bad when listening to an audiobook but it's very noticeable when listening to music and hopefully I can find an inexpensive headphone set that has good sound quality!"
2,What was Consumer Reports thinking?,"These were listed as a ""Best Buy"" by Consumer Reports, but they were by far some of the worst headphones I've ever bought at ANY price. The fit felt wrong from the get-go, and the sound quality was poor. Everything sounded distant and flat, not at all dynamic or crisp. They feel poorly constructed, and even though I'd never put fashion ahead of function, they look dorky and oversized, more like earmuffs than headphones. I'm quite disappointed in them, especially for a Sony product."
1,This pair breaks too easily,I got this pair of headphones; less than 2 months later they broke. The sound was poor and muffled and bad cords were causing one speaker to stop working while the other kept working ok. Needless to say it was like aural agony.Plus the hinges broke too and I handled them gently. They are so fragile you can't seaming enjoy listening to music without feeling worried about a hinge breaking. Both hynges broke. I manage to tape one back together ok; the other popped back out even when I taped it and I couldn't have it fit right anymore because the area where it broke coused the headphone to tilt when I put it on.Got another pair later on. The same situation all over again.A horrible piece of junk and A gigantic waste of money.Don't buy this pair of headphones.
2,not great for music. not great for the price.,You can definitely do better for the (low) price.Sony's in ear headplugs are discounted on Amazon down to $23 pretty often and sound better. So do a lot of cheap Sennheisers.They just lack clarity in the higher frequencies and have a muffled and too loud bass.
2,"Muffled, muddied sound","These headphones have a muffled, muddied sound. I bought them to use with my office boom box (Aiwa CSD-FDF81), thinking they would sound better than the speakers. They sound worse. My 17-year old son thinks they sound muffled, too. On the plus side, they are comfortable.I brought them home and tested them against a 15+ year old pair of Audio Technica headphones. No contest. The ATs sound bright and clear by comparison, but are uncomfortable.Keep shopping. Spend a little more if you must. Your ears will thank you. (I just ordered a pair of Grado SR-60 headphones on the recommendation of my audiophile brother.)"
4,"Great, for the price","I have been using this specific set of CD-series headphones for years and am just now making an upgrade to a higher-end set. For those years I was perfectly happy with these phones. They delivered a solid quality for an excellent price. I could wear them for long periods - 12+ hours - with little to no discomfort. They are, however, quite light and can fall off of a surface if the cord is left unchecked. The cord is also vulnerable to damage both externally and inside the phones (as I recently discovered). However, there are plenty of more expensive headphones that have these same failings without the quality delivered so they are certainly worth the minimal price. By no means are these an audiophile's headphones but for the price you will probably find no better."
4,Good But not a good portable set,"These headphones are good for the price with good sound.They aren't very good for portable cdplayers because of the large ear covers and the long cord.they have better sound than all my previous headphones including my cousins which has terrible bass.PROS:Good sound,comfortable fitCONS:Not very good for portables and not very good style,too plain.overall these are good for the price but not good for portable cdplayers.I am twelve years old and not stupid like the computer thinks when I made this!!!!!!"
2,For the price you can do better,cheap plastic and for the price you can find a better deal. Doesn't keep out noise and the round ear pieces don't fit average ears.
1,Forget Consumer Reports Review-These aren't reliable,"I also read about these in the recent Good Buys section of Consumer Reports. I picked up a pair in early August and they sounded great for a while (I agree with other reviewers that the headband feels plasticky and that the two wires instead of one do have a tendency to get more tangled.) Now, 4 months after I purchased them, the right speaker stopped working. I wrote Sony and they said they are only guaranteed for 3 months. Poor workmanship obviously leads to poor guarantees. Stay away!"
2,Stick to Cars,"I bought these a year ago because they were rated a ""best buy"" in the under $30 headphone category in Consumer Reports. Nothing could be further from the truth - too much bass, no upper range (12KHz and up) and an overall muffled sound.I own an old pair of Seinnheiser's that I use at home and cost me $18 nearly 12 years ago. They sound remarkably better - and I used a pair of Koss $200 headphones as a comparison.This is the second time I got burned listening to Consumer Reports audio advice, and definitely the last."
2,Poor Sound quality,"Don't be fooled! Just because it is a sony, does not mean it is the best! I found the quality of the padding to be poor, it was hard and uncomfortable on my ears. The inside of the headphones were made of felt and cardboard, hardly quality materials used for electronics. Sound quality was muffled. In my opinion the ones by Koss are better for a better price. I returned this one and got a KOSS UR-15C for the same price."
4,Comfy Headphones with Pretty Good Sound Quality,"I have been using this Sony headphones for more than a year now and I have no complaints. In fact, I am pleased with the quality of the sound and the comfort it provides.Sony, in my opinion produces quality products, very much understanding human-machine interactions. And this product is yet another example of Sony's quality.Pleasing stereo sound, light weight for the size and lenghty cable and ample soft cusioning are pluses. One obvious improvement could be cusioning the headband too. Notably the cusion padding around the ears add comfort while not sacrificing the sound quality.Good product for the price. Go for it, ofcourse, if you are not considering Bose at this time. :-)"
4,"For the money, these headphones can't be beat","I had used a pair of Grado headphones for a long time for listening to music on my computer while I worked, but they were getting old and it was time to replace them. Rather than blow $80 on another pair of Grado's, I decided to go the budget route with these headphones from Sony.To my surprise, these sound almost as good as the Grado's on my computer. There are a few songs where the bass is muddled, but midrange and treble sounds come in clearly. The casing keeps out external noises very well, and the headphones are VERY comfortable. You can wear these things all day long without it being a bother.I give this four stars because of the muddled bass sounds, but considering the low price this should be five stars. Unless you're using them to listen in on high-end stereo equipment, don't buy expensive headphones; get this Sony model instead and use the money you save to buy some additional music."
5,"Quality sound, comfortable wearing.","The last pair of headphones I was using gave me that ""distant and isolated"" sound quality. They were a pair of sony's and they recently became unusable after an unfortunate (or fortunate, depending on perspective) incident. So, I was put in the position of buying new headphones. I noticed that these headphones are quite comfortable. They surround your ears and there is no obstruction from excess cushioning to undermine the sound quality on the headphones. The padding sufficiently provides comfort around your ears, but leaves the interior open to accept direct sound. So basically it gives you a more personal musical experience. These headphones are not that much money, and people have thought I paid more than I did for them. So, for the money, they're pretty darn good. And they look pretty cool, too."
5,Wish This Man Made More,"Unfortunately Maurice White only recorded this lone solo album in 1985 during Earth,Wind & Fire's hiatus.His work with that band is superlative of course but 'Maurice White' is his own beast entirely.The first two cuts ""Switch On Your Radio"" and ""Jamboree"" are very happy and ethereal 80's funk-all handclaps and polyphonic synth orchestration,you know.But in both cases Maurice's lyrics are about joy and well being.""Believe In Magic"" and ""Invitation"" touch on similar territory while White spends the rest of this album as sort of a sepia Peter Gabriel,exploring minimal,African inflected soundscapes that his former band were more wary of,themselfs in search of more of a funky sound.One of the more individual of the EWF solo offerings 'Maurice White' is also the story of a promising solo career that has,and sadly will always remain somewhat unfullfilled."
1,"Great Singer, Bad Album",Only 1 hit on this entire album - I Need YouRest of album appeared to be poorly produced or artist experimenting in a different direction from his EWF writing and producing style.Just download the single you like and save your other $5 bucks.
2,pretty average,"first&formost Maurice White is one of those Cats that I think the World of.a True Genius&what He did with Earth,Wind&Fire still blows my mind.but His Solo Album was pretty lightweight overall to me.""I Need You"" was cool.His re-make of Ben E.King's ""Stand by Me"" sounded better in 85 than now to me.this Album just was kinda there.I wonder how come He didn't put out more Solo Albums? but then again His stuff with EWF,Ramsey lewis&the first Urban Knights along with His Other writing&Production under-takens He has Made up for it.but this Album didn't move me much."
3,OK,"It worked OK. It was light weight. The special batteries it needed were expensive to replace. I used it a long time, but finally replaced it with another system of the same brand with different batteries."
2,About 2 hours tops,"I love my Sennheiser wireless headphones -- except for the battery. This battery rarely lasts more than 2 hours. That's why I have a charging unit that charges two batteries. Also to keep in mind -- these batteries wear out fast. There's only so often you can recharge these things before they die completely. If I'd known how many of these $20 batteries I'd be going though, I would probably have picked a different brand of wireless headset."
1,You can hack this.,"Yeah, this proprietary case is ridiculously expensive. If you are a little bit handy, you can take the case apart using an exacto blade. Pry along the edges, it is plastic welded, but comes apart pretty easy. There are two V80H batteries inside made by Varta. These are 1.2V Ni-MH cells for a total voltage of 2.4V. You can buy the batteries inside the case here on amazon for [...] (1.2 Volts .08 Ahmps.), or from batteryspecialists.com for [...] when you buy 6. You will have to desolder the tabs from the old batteries and solder the new ones in there. Have fun."
1,The Sennheiser spare battery to my surprise was not a Sennheiser,"I have ordered a Sennheiser spare battery, but instead I've received a generic battery with a sticker on it, with which I could not even fit the battery into the charger."
1,Not a Sennheiser battery!,"The batteries I purchased (2) are not genuine Sennheiser batteries. They only last about one hour on a charge. The original Sennheiser branded battery lasted for several hours, and several years. This is the first replacement battery that I have had to buy in fove or six years. I expected the replacement to be of equal quality to the original, but it is not. In fact, I expected the purchased batteries to be Sennheiser branded batteries, since the Amazon listing said they were! I think I got ripped off! -- @%#^%$*&"
5,Sennheiser battery,"I am partially deaf and need aid to understand words on TV. I cycle a pair of these batteries for my well-used Sennheiser headphones; one in the phones and one ready in the recharge slot. They take quite a number of recharges before battery failure. This is just the second pair of replacement batteries I have needed in well over ten years of almost daily use of my headphones. These bulk packaged batteries, so far, have been just fine, and for a much less expensive price than the retail packaged ones. Be sure always to give a complete charge to a new battery before its first use."
1,Wrong battery in Amazon's add....Battery should be 2 AA rechargeable.,"I have read a number of the reviews and am very confused about this battery.. Many stated that they lasted many hours . When the unit requires 2 AA rechargeable batteries... how could this battery do anything? I thought that it could fit into the stand.... I have an old RS 120 that is still working after many years, without a battery change . I opened up the unit, and there is no battery in it. The headphones have 2 AA rechargeable batteries.. Are we being misled by Amazon or Sennheiser???When I was ordering the RS 130, I knew nothing about the batteries, relied on the Amazon display."
1,Not happy with this battery,I have bought these replacement batteries before but the ones I received this time both have a life of less than three hours - far too short and shorter than any previous ones I've had.
1,Beware. You don't get much for what you would pay.,You probably won't read this until too late BUT...Consider getting headphones from a manufacturer who isn't going to take you to the cleaners with replacement batteries.These don't hold much of a charge (2ish hours max) and they won't last long (maybe a year?). The real kicker is $20+ for a couple of hearing aid batteries in a goofy proprietary case? OUCH!I like(d) my Sennheiser headphones. Now they sit useless gathering dust. I'll ebay the headphones before I give Sennheiser any more of my money.
5,Product in Great Condition,"I bought the hearing device for my office and ever since I have started using the replacement battery I bought from Amazon, it is doing the job required. Never had a problem and I am very happy about the decision I made to purchase from Amazon."
3,Installation,Sennheiser Spare Battery for Headphones R140I bought this as a backup but cannot figure out where it goes even though I have read the instructions that came with the headphones. Can you help me figure this out
4,You will need this!,"You will need this to add to the base station to the Sennheiser Set 50 TV Wireless Mono Assistive TV Listening System. This extra battery will sit in the charger and when the main unit battery gets weak, it is very easy to switch batteries. Order at the same time you get the device. A unique battery so you should get now as it may not be in stores."
1,WHY IS THIS BATTERY STILL HERE,"You DO NOT need this battery. Amazon still has on the 130 Head set picture and the ""Frequently Bought Together"" photo.Well I fell for it and bought the battery. ebattery knows it's in error but yet people like me fall for it and good luck getting your 8 dollars back."
1,Not needed for RS180,"These batteries show up everywhere the RS180 headphones are mentioned, but they aren't needed (nor are they compatible) with the 180's. Amazon's fault, not Stennheiser's."
3,dont last long for the price,"I could not be happier at the overall performance of every Sennheiser product ive ever tried, but ofcourse its Sennheiser. Ive had a pair of HDR 85 headsets for over 2 years now, and ive been through about 15-16 batteries now ! . If Sennheiser didnt make such a great headset i would have gone to a new company more than a year ago."
4,SENNHEISER Spare Battery for Senheiser Headphones,"Excellent life span for such a tinny battery! I bought my Sennheiser Headphones about 3 years ago and only last month I had to replace the battery,and although it was still able to charge it, it would only hold the power for about half an hour."
1,Totally wrong size,"These items were bundled together and I assumed they went together,WRONG ! This is the wrong size battery for this unit. You need a BA300.Granted Amazo was awesome on the return and credit I recieved.But just wanted to give a heads up on the two products together."
2,Not Sennheiser brand as indicated.,"I hate being duped. The listing clearly indicates that this is a Sennheiser product but it is not. My original batteries are at least 6 years old by my recollection. One still works like new and the other is going bad so i ordered a replacement. At this point the 6+ year old OE battery is making a solid 4 hrs where the aftermarket replacement is falling a bit short. I have not done a truly scientific test at this point, but it is definitely less.I've taken part of the listing that was in place at the time of my order and posted below:Technical DetailsBrand Name: SennheiserSennheiser recommends this battery for owners of the RS 40, RS 45, RS 60, RS 65, RS 80, RS 85 wireless headphone systems and HDR 45, HDR 65, HDR 85 headphones."
1,free at last,"I've bought over ten of these in the time I've used my HDR80 headphones. Brand new, they'd only last a few hours, and it makes sense because they are just a couple 1.4v watch batteries stacked together once you crack the shell open.If you buy a headset that uses these, you can count on having to buy these batteries again and again, as they only seem to last for a few months before they get weak and won't hold a charge.At least I was able to modify my hdr80 so that I could power it with AAA's instead. I can enjoy great sound without the tax of buying these overpriced batteries. I'd avoid any headset that uses these, unless you don't mind the extra expense and hassle of doing the battery shuffle."
1,watch this company,they didn't send the right item and it's been hard to get them to respond to emails
2,Sennheiser spare battery BA-151,I bought two BA-151 replacement batteries that didn't fit until I removed the labels as the opening in the headphones would not accept the extra thickness. I was disappointed that the battery life in both batteries were about the same but only roughly two hours before needing a recharge. Don't know if the genuine Sennheiser battery would be any better but past reviews suggest that the short operating time might be typical.
1,No way this works,I bought this in a package deal since there are many times when the rechargable battery doesn't have enough power to get through what I trying to do. I assumed that the package was put together by people who knew what they were doing. No Way. There is now way this battery can be used with the Sennheiser headphones that I purchased. I have no idea how to find out what it can be used with.Lesson is; research the parts of a package before you buy the package.
1,wrong item,When I purchased Sennheiser IS410 Wireless Ultra-lightweight Assistive Listening Stereo Headphone System - the prompt from Amazon for 'customers who bought this… bought this' - so I thought it was the battery for the Headphones.It's not.Worse yet I opened it and then figured out it was the wrong battery.I'm not happy.
1,Very disappointing,"There is no history provided here. There is film footage from the periods. That is all. To call it ""history"" is very misleading and to call the footage ""remotely interesting"" would be hyperbole.History uses a narrative or some form of outline to present information about the time and events of interest. This ""collection"" of footage provides no outline or framework whatsoever and the footage contains very, very little information. It is simply a collection of uninteresting footage.The footage is certainly ""historical"", but to call these discs ""History of Fashion in Western Culture"" is similar to calling a (small) pile of dull and lackluster arrowheads, ""The History of Native American Peoples""."
3,A Catchy Pop Song With A Singer That Shows Talent,"This is an up-tempo song that surprisingly does NOT come from the Swedish hit factory that the Backstreet Boys and Britney seem to subscribe to so dearly. Actually, Angela Via is combining two of the big fads right now: latino-pop and girl-pop. Combine a beautiful face and a pleasant voice and you get a hit song. And at the end of the song, Via WAILS into an octave I thought only whales could reach. She doesn't have as much control over her upper range as Mariah Carey, but with a little training, that could be fixed. There are also snippets of her upcoming CD on this single, and a few of them sound fairly promising. This could be an artist to watch."
5,The best single out there,"I admit, I'm not really into singles. They're expensive for one song, and I think that I would much rather have an album of fifteen sings for twenty bucks then a single of one song for five bucks. But, in this case, I love the the song so much that I was happy to buy the single. It's such a good song, and Angela can sing like no other. You couldn't get her mixed up with Britney or the others, but you could mess her up for Mariah Carey. She's so good. The song was sweet and cute, and I loved the beat and everything. So, I think that buying the single is the best thing. You won't regret it."
2,Dog booties,I was disappointed this time with the booties. I have used these booties for several years and I was always satisfied with their durability but when I received my order this time I discovered that you had changed the leather to plastic on the bottom of the bootie which destroys their usefulness very quickly. I will need to look for a more durable product. This is very disappointing !!!!!
1,ugly ugly boots,uglyiest things ever. they dont stay on for even 5 min unless u want to cut ur dogs blood supply! LOL waste of money in my opinion.
2,Dont buy windmere fans!!!!,"When i got this fan and was putting it togther i was noticing that all of the parts were plastic and that the fan was cheeply made. When i turned the fan on i was very dissapointed because it did not move hardley any air, I thought that it might be becaust of how small it is. But i have a 12in table fan (that is the same size) and it moves twice as much air. I have another windmere fan and it doesnt move hardley any air either."
2,Hmmm... I should have realized by the number of WORDS,"I guess I didn't really pay attention to the fact that the article has only 724 words, and I took for granted their statement that this is ""typically"" 3-pages. But when formatted in M/S Word with all the extra spacing taken-out, it's exactly 1-page, not three.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that while it's a fly-sized bite of meat (it took me about ONE minute to read it), I guess I can't argue that it's meat, nonetheless - the tiny bit of advice seems worthy enough. I know I was only expecting a snack, but BOY, I'm still hungry! Maybe I would have been more satisfied if I had only paid $.99?"
1,Save Your Money,"This film really sucks. It's cheap -- the transfer is bad. It's ONLY redeeming feature is William Smith as ""Fitz"". As much as I LIKE the Billster, I can't in good conscience recommend this dog. I gave this one star because it won't you do less than that."
1,Still waiting :-(,"Well I know I like the Shotgun News, just wish it would come.... Don't think I can recommend ordering thru Amazon due to the long wait to get your subscription started :-( Over 1 1/2 months and still nothing. Have ordered other subscriptions for other magazines in the past and have had poor service and long waits. Wont order another magazine thru Amazon."
1,shotgun news,I have not received my order of Shotgun news as of yet ???cannot rate since i haven't received it yet
1,Why is this called SHOTGUN NEWS???,"Maybe I was expecting too much but this publication typically has NOTHING to do with SHOTGUNS??In fact the most recent issue I have has not 1 story about shotguns...if you are into rifles and pistols this may be the magazine for you, but if you are into shotguns, don't even think of picking this magazine up...they really should change the name, it is misleading."
3,Not what it used to be but still ok,While it took quite a while from placing my order until receipt of my first issue it was still worth it. I subscribed to this newsprint style magazine several years ago and I enjoyed the many carried listings in the classified sections. The magazine now lists limited classifieds but still is interesting to leaf threw. Once every three issues or so they deliver an expanded issue which is really all they need.
3,Shotgun News,"It has been now five weeks and the subscription has not yet started,I realize that it was stated that it would take 4-6 weeks but the paper comes out 3 times a month and I was hoping it would have started sooner than later!"
5,Excellent articles,I enjoy the articles a great deal. I also like to keep an eye on market rates for collectible and antique firearms.
2,"Runs Small In Size, Not As Bright","I bought a size 8 and could not wear the ring on any finger. It's very small and will need to be returned. Would suggest buying a size bigger than you normally wear.The silver bands with the CZ stones are not very clear, almost white and it throws off the attractiveness of the whole ring. The Marcasite stones are very beautiful and would have balanced better with a truer silver."
5,Very Satisfied,I bought this item as a gift and the recipient is very pleased with the product. This was a good buy especially since it was a gift for my mom and she's fond of Marcasite.
1,"Beautiful, but it might not be sterling silver....","I bought this for a gift. I had to return it once because it was too small and isn't true to size. I am returning again now, because the recipient told me it turned her finger green. I don't think this can be sterling silver if it is turning fingers green. I love all the Amazon products, but this one should be evaluated so this doesn't happen to others."
5,LOVE IT!,"I love this ring! I bought it when I lost a favorite of mine, hoping this would be a close second....I LOVE IT! I get so many compliments on it! I ended up finding the lost ring (Of Course!) but wear this one more often than the old on now anyways!"
3,"Beautiful, BUT...","The photos here almost don't do the ring justice - it is truly very pretty and eye-catching. I don't think I've ever gotten so many compliments on such an inexpensive piece of jewelry. However, as others have said here, within weeks, the stones started falling out. I got the ring two years ago. Within a year and a half, the ring had lost so many stones that it was unwearable. Granted, I only paid $39.00 for it, and I really wore it often; so I suppose I got my money's worth. I gave it three stars because it was so pretty for a short time. I got what I paid for it. If I wanted something to last for years, I should have looked for something more expensive."
3,Looks great but a tight fit!!,"I loved this ring when I bought it but was so bummed out because it didn't fit!! Since the ring is so large (it takes up your finger up to the knuckle), you need to buy this ring one size up. So I returned it and got the next size up. So happy thay I did!! I've also received many compliments!! It's also perfect for a right hanbd ring!!"
1,poor quality,I have had this ring 2 weeks and a stone has already fallen out! Very disappointed. I have no idea how to return it either.
2,It's okay,"Initially it is pretty, but for the price it isn't very much. Looks and feels like it would break in a few months. The thing is itchy against your fingers. You can't really tell the black is there. The picture is, in this case, alot 'prettier' than the actual thing."
1,Disappointed,I was so excited to get this ring!!! But within a few hours of wearing it my finger had turned green!!!! I have other sterling silver jewelry and it's never had that effect on me before. Makes me doubt it's made of sterling silver. Bummer. Very disappointed with this product.
2,Better on the Pic,"I love Sterling Silver & so I thought this would be a classy-looking piece. However, the crystals were very dull & the fit of the ring runs Very small. I wore it once uncomfortably, & was frustrated because I don't give away items that I myself don't like, so it was a waste of $$."
2,Unhappy customer,"I have been wearing the ring for about a month and have had many compliments about the ring. However, the crystals are coming out in several spots. I would not recommend buying this product due to the lack of quality."
3,It's great looking... but not-so-well-crafted...,"Its a FINE accessory... a great add-on to an all black or silver outfit... but my first ring had zirconias falling off, and tiny as it is, a missing stone doesn't look that great... i got a new one, but there is still that fear that stones might start coming off when i use it.overall, it looks great, a good accessory... but if you're looking for a more long-term, worry-free ring... that you won't have to check every so often if stones are missing... this is not for you."
2,Odd ring,in person the ring looks fake and the size is very odd. One side is smaller then the other. So its hard to wear. I got a size 6 and it fits like a 5 on bottom and 6 on top.
2,ring,the ring looks very nice but the stones are not mounted very well. After wearing it for 3 months I lost several stones.
2,Disappointed,"I have had my ring for just over a month and was quite pleased with how it looked,however, I have just noticed there are already 2 stones missing and I am very disappointed."
2,poor quality,After a few months this ring started to break apart. The crystals are coming out of the little shells.
3,Sterling Silver 6-Row Marasite and Crystal Ring,I liked the ring at first sight. But I am disappointed that I have already lost some of the stones. Its only been a couple weeks.....
4,Silver Marcasite/Crystal Ring,"I bought this ring for work. I typically wear a size 6 for rings, but bought an 8. I figured since the ring has twists it might not be perfectly smooth and round. I was right. If you buy this ring I would suggest getting a size or two larger to ensure that it fits. For the price the ring is beautiful! It looks great with almost any outfit. It really helps to dress an outfit up. This is a great generic ring that can go with all kinds of outfits. If you are looking for a great day-to-day or even a 'going out' ring I would recommend buying this. However, I would keep in mind the sizing."
1,BAIT AND SWITCH,DO NOT BUY THIS RING BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET THIS RING THEY WILL SEND YOU A SIMILAR RING THAT IS FLAT THE PICTURE CLEARLY SHOWS THE ROWS ARE RAISED THE RING THEY SHIPPED IS FLAT AS A PANCAKE I CALL THIS BAIT AND SWITCH AND TOTALLY ILLEGAL!!!!
2,Nice design but not at all sturdy.,"This book is a great concept and designed really nicely.However, a little pressure on the seam and it just tears and comes apart. For us, this book was damaged not after weeks or months of use, but after about an hour or two of supervised use. The paper holding each page together is too thin."
2,Boring...,GTO drags along for tons of episodes to crap a conclusion into two abrupt episodes. I did not like it at all.
1,Get Low..... More like Get Bent,"The title says it all. My suggestion to anyone looking to buy this cd for the tracks try using a little device on the internet called ""Kazaa.com"" and save your $15 for something more meaningful like gas to put in your ride while you cruise down the street playing your Lil Jon Part II cd you have made for free."
1,THIS IS A MUSICAL TREASURE. AN AUDITORY MASTERPIECE,"Wow, what a bunch of musical geniouses. I mean they rap about killing, money, and hoochies. No other rappers do that. They aren't copying everybody else with such original concepts. And their lyrics have so much meaning and depth to them. It's nice to see artists who aren't merely mindless clones enacting what their culture expects them to be. I think they are just so great and worth spending my $15 so they can be rich and I can enjoy listening to such works of art as Bia Bia and Put Yo Hood Up. I encourage everyone to buy this CD and support these wonderful artists and everyone like them. Maybe that will encourage record companies to produce more artists like them. God knows the world needs more groundbreaking artists such as Lil' John. If everyone were as smart and gifted as Little John and the Eastside Boyz the world would be such a wonderful place.P.S. This world is doomed. (And people like you are the reason)"
4,Lil Jon!!!!!,"This is Lil Jon's good album, not best. Kings of Crunk was the best. This album features a great track, Get Low Remix. This features Ying Yang Twins, Busta Rhymes, and Elephant Man. The video is kinda a spoof on Run DMC's video with Aerosmith, Walk This Way. It is good. You gotta get it!"
3,Gets slack in the sack,"This movie starts as a sharp and engaging study of two people flirting and edging around some unspecified mutual history, but seems to go completely limp when, ahem, the deed is done. Perhaps the characters just wear out their welcome: Only Woody Allen can really make you care to spend two hours with self-obsessed and neurotic New Yorkers, and even he can't do it all of the time. The more I found out about these two the less interesting they seemed, and I found myself checking the time. The split-screen works well as the characters' identities unspool, but again loses its punch as the hours roll by. One unexpected bright spot: quirky and cool songs by the new first lady of France!"
4,Interesting,An interesting spin on relationships. It was nice to see Helena Bonham Carter with her hair and makeup done. Aaron Eckhart was great as always.
3,split screen well done,"The entire movie is shot with a split screen and a two-angle view of every single scene. There are quite a few flashbacks and a number of comparison shots. At first, I wasn't sure about the strategy but it works with the storyline and highlights the purpose of the storytelling. It's different, it's interesting, it makes you think and question relationships and faithfulness and the truth of love."
3,Anyone know if there's a soundtrack for this movie?,I loved the soundtrack and the songs played in this movie - does anyone know if there is a sound track available?
2,it was ok,"the best thing about this film is that it's only 80 minutes because the story-line and everything else just revolves around two People through most of the film and the split screen effect wears thin after a while. it was Ok. Meeting at a Wedding and going back over each other's lives is interesting,but the film never fully sizzles and just ends on a whimper. it is interesting and then it just looses steam."
2,Not worth watching,"Well.. I am somewhere between ""hated it"" and ""did not like it"". I watched it on my tv and thankfully not paid for it. The whole movie is in a split screen and though it started out as interesting becomes annoying later. Then the too much talking part.. its just that..talking between two people in close shots and its plain boring. There is no story line as such and I am not sure what they wanted to show or tell. Don't watch it."
1,Deadly Bore,"I rarely trash a film, but Conversations warrants a strong warning label. The male lead has zero chemistry with our ""heroine"". Neither is likeable. Their banter is a snooze. Who wrote this drival? Even as a rental...and a cheap rental at that...this was torture. Save yourself and forego this waste of time."
2,Sizing is inaacurate,The product itself is good however the sizing is quite off. I bought a size 2.5 for my 10 y/o daughter and they were at least one size too small.
2,Witch oil!,During Summer 2012 my alergy symptoms were bad. Saw an article that recomended Perilla Oil to help combat alergies. Don't know whether the product I bought through Amazon was substandard or if the recomendation was off the mark. Just know there was no change in my symptoms while using the product.
3,PERILLA OIL,"I haven't finished the bottle that I purchased. I don't know if I will, because for some reason I am not taking this on a daily basis."
2,...,"This movie is only worth owning if you are a hardcore fan of the whole creepy ghost kid niche of Asian horror because this movie doesn't really offer much else other than that. A woman is going through a divorce and struggling to keep custody of her child from her ex husband. In the process the former house wife has to find a job and most importantly, a new apartment to live in... Yeah you can see where this is going. So the new apartment starts getting leaks (SUSPENSEFUL and FRIGHTENING leaks) and she sees odd looking girl who is not supposed to be living in the apartment, and lot's of water and raining and the mystery of how the girl died for that matter (gee I wonder how the girl died?)Throw in a stupid twist and you basically have a film that has been done a hundred times before in Japan. At least the ghost doesn't meow in this movie. I can't imagine how bad the Hollywood remake is going to be after seeing this floater."
2,bland and boring,"For the asian horror circuit, this movie provides little entertainment. There are just so many better options out there than this movie. For horror, it fails completely because its just not that scary. The ending provides a mild, slightly exciting conclusiong but its not worth the time spent to get there. The remake is actually a little better than this, though not much."
2,Another creepy girl in water...KUSO O TABEMASHOU!,"What a joke of a movie!Cliche, cliche, cliche, cliche, etc. Only two stars because crappy apartments are scary! If you are trying to decide this and one of the other related movies, then try another one first, this one is far too slow and laughably boring. (I think Ringu and the amusing Uzumaki are best).I'm glad I didn't see the American movie first, something this bad won't translate. The comments on divorce/motherhood just do not make sense to most Americans. Nor does the huge shame of having some psych treatment. Nor does not beating your building manager if you have a massive waterstain!! At least the themes of familial love, social estrangement and simple hate in A Tale of Two Sisters/The Eye/Ring made some sense.If I see another horror movie about a girl in water with long bangs, I'm shoving a hose in my head and turn it on til it explodes!"
4,As ALWAYS a step above the Amercian remake!,"I watched the American version of Dark Water and honestly, didn't care much for it all; not even knowing it WAS a remake. However, I like Japanese horror enough to give this one a chance to stand on its own and not blame it for it ""lukewarm"" Amercianized version. I really enjoyed this one MUCH better. The little girl in it is just too adorable for words! I thought the mother was great and I liked the acting quite a bit too. My one remaining problem with this one, one of the same I had in the US version in a personal one. I don't know about all of YOU, but I am sure as fire giong to go down fighting and I would NEVER voluntarily leave my baby. I would have been mad a (*#* and ready to fight like the dickens. That is just personal though and doesn't affect the film. It is DEF worth a view if like this type of film and worth adding to your collection!"
4,"Kinda like the Ring/the Ring 2, but more emotional","Dark water is about a mother who has recently divorced and is currently battling for custody of her daughter. The mother and her 5 year old girl move into a new apartment that appears to have a leak in the ceiling. As the leak gets worse, the daughter has increasingly unpleasant visits from a mysterious little girl in a yellow raincoat.This movie moves a little slow and is not very scary at all. It's similar to the Ring 2, because of the water theme and the ghost-girl-trying-to-steal-another-child's-mom story, but the Ring 2 sorta sucked. I felt no connection to the mother or the child, and they didn't seem to have a very strong bond. You couldn't ""feel the love"". And the kid in this movie is quite cute, while the child in the Ring was just plain creepy. I was rather teary towards the end of Dark Water, and I like movies that have emotion. All in all, this is not a scary movie and not a fast-paced movie, but pretty good."
3,There's Something Strange In The Neighborhood,"The Good -- This movie's tightly paced and while certain scenes seem to lag, they're over before they overstay their welcomes.There are some genuinely creepy moments that were missing from the remake. I won't spoil them here, but suffice to say, this movie continues the trend of making Asian school girls scary.The Bad -- The end resolution comes out of nowhere. Yes, one could piece together what the spirit wants, but it's just so abrupt that I couldn't care less about the movie at its reveal.Despite some creepy moments, Dark Water doesn't offer much that hasn't been seen before or since, which is a shame since it's well-made with decent acting all around.The Ugly -- The physical reveal of the spirit at the end. The physical effect with accompanying sound effect is cheesy and made me laugh. Add this to the already hackneyed ending and an average experience stays average."
5,Dark Water (Japanese Version),"I had seen the film a couple of times before but never got the chance to see it beginning to end. I did very much enjoy this version. It tends to have a more dark and gloomy feeling to it. You're able to watch the movie in Japanese language with english subtitles, or if you prefer you may select to watch it in english dubbed. Either way, you'll enjoy the flick. I recommend this if you're into any of the Japanese horror, suspense, and mystery films.Ringu Anthology of Terror (Rasen/Ringu/Ringu 2/Ringu 0)"
3,Disorienting,"I didn't dislike this movie, but I do dislike when plot twists end up changing the entire story from one side to another entirely. The movie was creepy even with the regular water, and the American version's (I like Jennifer Connelly, but American versions are always changed with the most stupid details - Ringu and The Ring 2 for example)going to have brown water, but I'm wondering what else will be changed to up the scare tactics? I'm also thinkingalot will be changed to avoid confusion. I never saw the clues in the movie and the end came as a shock to me."
3,Scary movie,"I thought it was a very scary movie. It was kinda gross in a way. The little girl played her role very well. Dark Water is very similar to Ring. If you like scary/gross movies, here is one for you. Don't watch it alone."
2,it s not great movie,"bueno..debo decir..que ya estoy un poco cansado de tantas peliculas..japonesas de terror.. que siempre..se vuelven muy repetitivas,,,esta no es la excepcion..lo unico emocionante son los ultimos minutos.. no se si considerarla terror.. o drama..pero..creo que ya es un tipo de pelicula que repiten mucho...saludos"
5,"Again, a sad movie.",This movie was the best thing. I had read the manga and read the novel. So I watched the Japanese version. It was real good and spooky but sad and lonely.
2,On Man Caravan,"A very boring read with no soul. This man went on this incredible journey, never wasable to get to know the people, or enjoy the beautiful countryside. It was like theAmerican who goes and comes back from abroad and didn't have an appreciation for theculture,food, the people or even the beautiful places he went. Very disappointing. I wasexcited to get this book, because I had been to many of the countries he went across.He did have one beautiful motorcycle made for the trip, and the few pictures in the bookwere good."
5,One Man Caravan,"This book is the parent of the motorcycle travel genre. Mr. Fulton took off on a ""round the world"" for the first time that is documented. The amazing thing is that through this book we get a look at places that are very much in the news today. Travel in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Iraq, Turkey and India are in the book along with the difficulty of his passages in these countries.From the seat of Mr. Fulton's motorcycle we see a world 1930's world that had not felt the effect of the second world war. The Dutch East Indies are in place, the French are in Indochina and the mid east, and Japan is still at peace. This book shows the world as it was on a classic motorcycle trip."
3,good - but....,"Overall, the book is interesting and informative. It gives some great detail about the middle east, India and Asia in general. From a people perspective, I liked the fact that Mr. Fulton goes into some detail about what the people were like and some personalites. I did find however, that in some spots he focused too much on what people thought and not enough on his thoughts and feelings about ""where"" he was. Toward the end of the book, he rushed. He spent 80% of the time on the Middle east and India, 10% in the rest of Asia, and no time at all anywhere else. Again, overall, it was interesting and informative, but it did not capture my attention like say Jupiters Travels (same genera, by Ted Simon)rk"
4,Tragic story.,It was rather depressing but I realize it's important to get the info out there about what goes on.
1,"Bristles Come Out in Clumps, Not Durable or Effective","I've found two types of grill brushes. The older kind that I'm used to using have strong copper colored bristles that will last a whole season or more. But lately I've seen many out of China that have silver bristles that don't even last one season,and they tend to come off in whole pieces. Unfortunately, when this arrived I discovered it had the kind of bristles that resemble those that don't last. And that's exactly what happened, big clumps coming out by the third use, and the bristles aren't really that strong at cleaning either. I think the traditional wood handled models are more likely to have the old style bristles... now I'm going to try to wooden handled Weber model available through Amazon."
4,"12V, Electronic Thermometer,",good item worth the price only 2 problems for me. First for the outside thermometer its kind of hard to find a place to put it in without it being affected either by the heat of engine or direct sunlight or the heat of transmission or the wind when vehicle is in motion and second you can only uses the light when you connect it to the lighter its not either battery or lighter plug which for me makes my inside of the car look cluttery with all the wires that i have
2,Not reliable,"This unit has some attractive features, but did not last long. The temperature sensor MUST be mounted in precisely the right location, or you will get wildly erroneous readings. Product quit functioning after 6 months"
4,Beardfish - Another Great Prog Band From Sweden,"This is Beardfish's 3rd studio album and first to be released here in the U.S. The album is part one of a two disc concept piece. Part one is the ""day"" with part two being his ""night"". Overall I don't like this quite as much as the band's previous effort ""The Sane Day"", but the album certainly has its moments. Musically the band takes it's sound from many progressive rock influences. Hints of Frank Zappa, Gentile Giant, Pink Floyd, Yes, and others permeate the disc. There are also passages that evoke jam bands similar to Umphrey's McGee. These guys are great musicians and show off their chops throughout the disc. The vocals and songwriting are also strong. Sweden has been a hotbed for progressive rock in the last decade or so, and Beardfish rank right up with the best of the lot."
5,Loved Them!,"I wore these shoes for my wedding this summer and Loved Them!! I was worried about being sore and I wore them ALL day. We had an outdoor ceremony and an indoor reception. I danced all night and forgot I was wearing heels!! Granted, I am already a heel wearer, so if you arent, I'd wear them around the house to get used to them!"
3,Stealth Patrol,"As someone who has read 15 books by different Vietnam Veterans, Stealth Patrol, gets an average grade of C+. A little slow at the beginning, it picks up through the middle, and due to the author agreeing to a second tour of duty where he no longer pulls mission, the ending is slow and anti-climatic.If you enjoy reading about different units and different geographic locations where the war was fought, then this is a good book."
1,not good not factual,"After serving in Nam & in this unit The book goes nowhere, not discriptive of reality it does not potray actual missions"
4,The First Fiasco,The book is a good recollection of how it was. It is very much first person and personal based more or less on what we knew at the time. A good read.
1,"Dissapointing range, Useless Web support","Installation was difficult, since it is not mentioned that a restart of the cable modem is required. Confusing setup, supplied documentation: 13 lines for configuration. Complete manual only available from website, which requires already a working connection - the one we are working on!No information on how to deal with an office printer/fax combo if hooked up to the ECM (is it?) printer port. No information on how to set up a network printer connecting via network cable.The range is claimed to be 40 meters indoors. It is unoperational from my home office to my patio which is 17 meters.The website support is unusable due to a bug, which makes sending all the filled out obligatory information along with the message impossible - Frustrating!It works close to base, but does not give me the full mobility I expected.I will exchange it for another system."
1,Died after 8 month,When it was working needed the reboot few times. One day it just died with status LED red. Opened it up. Capacitor in the power supply died. As a result it killed the circuitry too (besides the power supply). Fixed the power supply. The router is still dead.Could not find a receipt. Figures shipping cost will be about the cost of the new router. Bought another one. This time D-link. So far so good.
1,No Technical Support,"I used 2623 wireless router for about a year. It required oftento reboot so I decided to download FW upgrade which should fixthis problem. After FW download, router stopped working completely.There is no phone number to call for tech. support. I senttwo mail and still no response.Never buy electronic product from company which does nothave phone support!"
3,used to be a good product till firmware upgrade- bad support,"Have used this for the last 2 years and never had any issues. Recently, I decided to upgrade the firmware on this router.Do not upgrade to V1.1 Release 10 for 2624 on their support website if you want your VPN to work. I know it is the router firmware because it used to work right before the upgrade.Their support charges $45 to open an incident so I am trying to find a previous release of the firmware so that I can get my VPN connection to work again !!!"
3,Ok For The Price,"The blades are sharp and hold their edge. However, the handles are not very sturdy. I have other Wusthof knives they are far more sturdy and heavier than the ones in this set."
3,Paring Knife set,The Wusthof Goument Paring Knife Set cut great but the quality of the knives didn't seem to be up to the quality I have come to expect from Wusthof compared to the other knives I own. The workmanship wasn't as good.
3,Informative but not quite there.,"Was helpful in realizng the actions of parents to their children, but I found other books more helpful overall such as, Toxic Parents overcoming their hurtful legacy and reclaiming your life, by Dr. Susan Forward. Not only helping the child, but focusing on the parent and how to correct their own lives."
3,"More empathy, please","This book has been helpful for me in turning around a lot of the unhealthy parenting patterns I learned from my dysfunctional parents. But I also was annoyed at times by what seemed to me to be a scolding, moralizing tone. Also, I felt the author should have shown a bit more empathy for her audience (as she does in her other books on alcoholic families). I finished the book with a bubbling rage toward my parents. Why did they get -- and exercise -- the option to fail their kids, while I am stuck having to work extra-hard to parent differently? Why do they get let off the hook so easily, yet I remain accountable? I've been stuck with this anger ever since my 4-year-old daughter was born, and even therapy hasn't thoroughly eliminated it. I do think Woititz owes us -- the true heroes in the struggle to break the chain of abuse -- a bit more validation and empathy than she shared in this book."
3,Decent tools,"I needed an unusual size 11/32"" magnetic nut-driver. (Seems strange 11/32"" is unusual, but it is). The only kit I could find was this one, so you get what you buy because there are no other choices. Kit is made in China and shows in quality. Weak magnets etc, Generally pretty basic tools that function pretty well. I'd prefer to pay more and get better tools, but in this case not an option."
2,Ok for non-runners,"When I bought these, i was going for a running's security headset. These, although they didn't pop out easily from just listening and reading or writing or even while on the bike, these had no chance of staying in my small ears while running. I like headphones that go into my ear vs. just sit on the little ""nook"" of my ear-hole. These did not accomplish this. If you are a runner or intense movement exerciser, these aren't for you. Otherwise, they are great."
5,World's best headphones,"I think these are the world's best headphones, in this weight-class and price-class. I feel these are terribly under-priced by Sony. I've been using this for the last 5 years, with very frequent rough handling, and they refuse to die. Sound quality is excellent. You could wear this the entire day and you won't feel a thing. For this price, just buy it, even if you don't plan to use it. Who knows, Sony might discontinue this product and you might see a need for such great/light headphones in the future."
2,Headphones not for the long run,"Ordered 2 of these headphones just weeks ago for use with iPod when working out and running. First one stopped working within days. Second one has been ok so far, but not a high quality product. At least it stays in the ears and on the head while running."
3,Good sound quality,The sound quality is great when these headphones are properly seated. I can't get them to stay in place and I think it's because the top portion is a little too big for my head. Might be perfect if my head was a little bigger. Excellent sound quality for lightweight headphones!
1,Defective and horrible sound,"Surprisingly enough, these headphones came out of the box with the wire already loose and causing some crackling sound when the wires were jostled. Plus, they sound horrible!"
2,Not the same quality as the version from the ninetys.,"Years ago had the same headset, The pair i owned had been run over and still kept kicking. The recent pair was sat on and broke."
5,Love these for running!,I prefer these to earbuds when doing my cardio. I don't have to worry about these becoming loose and falling out of my ears as I move around. I would recommend these to anyone looking for some new headphones for working out.
4,No More Earbuds!,"I been a big fan of these headphones from way back when they used to come with the sony walkman cassette players .I Honestly tried to use the earbuds that came with my Iphone , but they keep falling out !Also I wear them at work so if I need to her what is going on around me or have a quick conversation I can quickly drop them down around my neck.They sound great! and you dont look like your wearing headphones because they are black . I highly recommend !"
4,Good product for the price,"I am an avid runner and have purchased many headsets searching for one that will remain on my head and in my ears while running. This one certainly does, FINALLY! I am a little disappointed with the sound quality, it's not as bassy as I would of wished but overall this is a good product for the price."
5,My favorite headphones,"These headphones are perfect for long workdays, as they are comfortable in the ears, allow some surrounding sound to come through (for safety) and stay ON without getting in the way. I let the cords run down my back to my Sansa Clip, clipped to my back pocket. The 2-pack with splitter was perfect, giving me a spare pair plus an often useful splitter. The audio response of these headphones seems to be extemely accurate, with crystal-clear treble and accurate, but not overpowering, bass."
5,Very comfortable,If you don't like the feeling of ear bud type headphones you will love these they are very comfortable you almost don't know you are wearing them and the the sound quality is above average just what you would expect from Sony.This is my second set after leaving the last pair on a airplane they are durable I had the first pair for over 4 years
4,Pretty good.,"Would never stay on my head, but they lasted a long time. I just wore a hat with them or used bobby pins to pin them to my head."
4,Good customer service,The headphones are light and they do the job. My first pair did not function properly and I had notified them. They sent me a near pair with no cost and I appreciated it very much. The second pair works fine but I have to be delicate with them.
2,Always Need to be Replaced,"I like how these work, but they need to be replaced every 2-to-3 months. If they lasted longer, I would like them more."
3,They kinda suck,"I bought these headphones for exercising and kicking around.Given the price, what did I expect?Pros:PriceIf they break it doesn't matterthey are lightRemind me of the Sony sports headphones in my Walkman from 1994 but they don't sound as good.Cons:The lightweight chord has so little weight it tickles your chin and face because it does not fall straight down.They sound like garbage. They have no bass, crashy treble, and make everything sound crunchy.the chord is too short for running. I have to pull my shorts up really high so i don't have to run like Igor (I'm only 6 ft tall, ok). Chord should be like 10 inches longer.the point where the chords leave the headphones is strange, it's like 2 inches up from the bottom of the ear buds. Why?If you are poor, short, or don't really care about sound quality your mileage may vary.Otherwise get some Koss PortaPros, live with the sweat, and be done with it."
3,Not what I was expecting,"When I bought these, I was under the impression that they had ear buds on the tips. Not so. These have a hard round tip with the speakers facing forward and they have an odd fit in my ears. You can hear well enough and they are very light, but I can't imagine why they would want to design these this way."
4,great headset,This headset is by far the best set for the money. I'm a runner and they are comfortable and sound great. They look and feel delicate but have proved durable. If it had an in-line volume control it would be a 5 star.
5,Love them!,"These headphones are lightweight and flexible. I love how they stay in my ears while I exercise; earbuds have never worked for me. The sound quality is great and the cord is a good length. Since I wear them while exercising, I tend to tug on the cord a bit, which eventually makes them cut out a lot. Even with this, though, they usually last a couple of years and I keep buying them because of the low price and comfort."
4,"light weight, good price, but short cord","My ears always hurt after using the in the ear headphone. One day, I borrow my friend's vertical in-the-car headphone for quick sampling of music and want one immediately! This one is light weight, stay in my ear, does not hurt after many hours and price is right (eek tech sells it for 1.99?! but with shipping is about the same price as Amazon.) The only problem I found is the cord seem to be a bit short - I wish it was longer and is thinking of getting an extension cord"
5,Sony Headphones,The headphones work wonderfully and lasts a while. I recommend purchasing them. Good buy!
3,"great headphones...for like, 4 months...","i can't seem to NOT buy these...mainly because they fit snuggly and comfortably in your ear while working out, they NEVER fall out or require ajustment...the PROBLEM is that they work for about 4-6 months, depending upon how heavily you use them, before one of the earpieces goes out...its happened on EVERY pair i've owned, so many i can't count...fortunately they are cheap...so just buy 2 pairs so you don't get annoyed when they do, because they WILL....i wish Sony would work on that problem, i would even pay MORE for them if they would just last a YEAR!"
5,"After over 10 years of use, mine are still going strong!","I have owned my Sony MDR-W08L headphones for over 10 years. They have never failed me and are so comfortable to wear. I didn't even know they still made them until I was searching Amazon.com for headphones for my husband. I totally recommend these, they are excellent!"
3,Good Value,"Seems like a very serviceable product for the price. I use them for workouts at the gym and the sound, while not spectacular, is fine for the use to which I put them. Good value."
5,My favorite headphoness,"I've had 4 pairs of these headphones. I love the fit, sound and weight. When they fail, it's in the cord, usually near the plug. Nevertheless their lifespan is long, and I think their value is twice the price."
5,SONY Lightweight Ear Phones,"I just received the headphones and so far I am pleased with the sound quality. I use them for running with my SONY armband radio. They are comfortable to wear. I hope they will last, however I bought 2 pair so I have one as a back up since the price is low."
4,"Long time user, love these headphones","I have been using these sony head phones for 5-10 years and love them. I am happy to see them on Amazon, the only other place I know that sells them is Target, for the same price (about $10). I use them for running 3-4 times a week. Throughout the years, I have tried other kinds, earbuds, the kind that wrap behind the ears, but these are the only headphones that stay on my ears when I run. My only complaint is that I wish they were more durable, I have to replace mine every 3-4 months because one of the ears goes out. I would pay more for a more durable pair. But for the price, you can't beat them! If you intend to be a heavy user, I would recommend having an extra pair on hand. There is nothing worse than struggling through a workout and one side goes out!"
3,Great but breaks too soon!,"I am an avid fan of these headphone and have been using them for YEARS! They are cheap, small, light and fit my ears perfectly. I wear them when training, running marathons, racing triathlons, traveling, etc.My ONLY complaint, and this is a big one, is the durability. After a few months (3-9) months one of the headphones will stop working. I will move the wire around that connects to the earpiece and sometimes it'll come to life but then, just as quickly, is dead again. There's no warning that one of the wires is about to bite the dust. Next thing you know, after strapping on your running shoes and prepping for a 2-hour run you are only hearing music from one ear.Since these headphone are cheap and comfortable I buy 2-3 paid each time I purchase them and while buying multiple pairs may be more expensive in the long run versus buying a more expensive set of headphones, I just can't find anything as comfortable."
1,Horrible,I used these on my iPod. I also used these for running. the sound is ok. Very little bass and kind trebly. They lasted about 6 months then stopped working all the while they kept deteriorating. The cord is very thin and very weak. I stepped on it twice and the wiring became exposed. The cord ultimately looked like an electrical taped mess. The left channel stopped working after 6 months. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who is going to use these for working out in any way. I suppose they are fine for commuting or general use.
1,DON'T DO IT!!!!!,Don't do it! Don't waste your money like I did. I got these headphones and wasn't even able to listen to ONE song!!! Not one song! That's because they NEVER worked. I opened the package and plugged them into my ipod and nothing! Not to mention I could barely get the thing to fit on my head. I contacted the seller to see if we could arrange something before I gave them a negative review and they never responded to my email and I gave them 2 weeks. Just don't waste your money like I did.
1,"good sound, but basically cheap plastic crap","I bought these as a possible replacement for the Sony MDR-A35 headphones, which are apparently not available. These ""new"" headphones sound great, but they reek of ""cheap plastic crap"" syndrome. I'm really surprised that Sony put its name on this product. I'm not holding my breath that these headphones will stand up to a lot of normal use, let alone the usual abuse that occurs while exercising.Ugh!"
3,You can find better for the gym,"If you need headphones for the gym, you can find better ones than these ones."
1,Headphones,"These headphones suck, and ended up in the garbage. Please excuse me for being negative, but these are not worth the money."
5,"love it, love it, love it","I have purchased these before in the stores, but they are getting harder and harder to find. For some reason people prefer those uncomfortable ear buds that always seem to fall out, are too big, and just annoying. These headphones are not big and silly looking like standard head phones. They are pretty discrete (can wear them at work), dont hurt, and work wonderfully when you are active like jogging, doing house work, and yard work.love them."
2,"Good sound quality, but they don't fit - OUCH!","I like ear buds, but when I workout it seems like as I sweat I always have to adjust and push them back in, so I wanted to buy headphones that would stay in place. With the headband piece, this set stays in place, but the in-ear portion doesn't fit without discomfort. I can get them close enough to my ears that I can faintly hear the music or tv, but not well enough to leave them like that for my entire workout. Or I can push them into my ear for a better fit, but they are hard plastic so they hurt. They are well made, the sound is great, and the head piece adjusts easily, but I ended up switching back to my ear buds because I don't have to mess with them as much as these. Really disappointed. Glad I didn't pay too much."
2,I bet these would be great if they worked,"I gave my wife an old set of Sony MDR-014 which came with my Walkman and then regretted it years later, so I ordered this stand-alone equivalent. I LOVED those MDR-014's, and the MDR-W08L's are pretty much the same except they're grey instead of white. However, when they arrived, there was absolutely no sound coming out of the right headphone no matter how much I wiggled the cord.I give this two stars, not because the left headphone really sounded awesome, but because Amazon refunded my order without requiring me to send it back. Good for them! They trusted me enough to realize that it wasn't worth the value of this $8.13 defective product to ship it back and dealt with me on the honor system. Kudos to Amazon for dealing with this reasonably."
1,"Left ear didn't work, right sounded poor anyway","Received it and the left ear didn't work out of the box. I tried it in multiple devices. On top of that, the right ear didn't sound very good anyway. Returned it for a refund and got something else.Skip this and spend a little more money. Not worth the risk or poor quality even for listening to spoken word audio."
5,"great, light, headphones","I love these light headphones. The price is great, so I get several sets when I order. After a time one of the channels stops working, therefore the ordering of multiple sets. I have had the channel stop in more expensive headphone sets also, so I think this is a great value!!!!"
3,The cord is too short,"It is barely long enough to reach from the top of the elliptical machine to my ears. It bounces around and hits me in the face because it doesn't hang low enough. Really annoying. Other than that, I have no problem with the sound quality or anything. It's just a comfort issue. I will buy an extension cord. These are clearly a cheap pair of headphones."
5,My fav running headphones,"The pair of these I have I think I bought in 1995, and they're still kicking. I bought those new spongy in ear headphones because they looked like a good idea, but when I'd get really running and sweating, the one in my left ear would start crackling from the seal and sweat. Yuck. Annoying. So, after those finally gave out I somehow re-located my old pair of these Sony's and after running in them this week I don't know why I ever quit wearing them. I thought they had stopped making them! Yay!"
2,not rugged,"I got this for gym use. The cable is shorted than what it should be for normal elliptical/treadmill use. Now one side stopped working. When the cable is held is one particular position, the sounds comes back indicating it's a contact issue where the cable joins the ear piece. This ear phone is comfortable but I do not recommend it."
3,in needs more bass!,"It was cheap. It came quickly. It works good for spoken-word audio like listening to my favorite Rush Limbaugh station. But for music it sucks! There's no bass.I'm' a kind of an audiophile, so this feature is important to me.And also, the earpieces don't stay in my ears while I'm doing anything active.Bottom line: you get what you pay for. Next time I'll pay the extra ten bucks and get some bass."
5,What I Need At a Great Price!,"I have spent so much money trying to find the right earpieces for my iPod. I found out that one of my ear holes is not as large as the other, and also if earpiece worn for too long, it starts to hurt. I then bought headphones, but that doesn't look right, big headphones with a tiny iPod. I read the reviews on this, and it sounded like these were for me. Plus, they are a great price. When I got them, I was so excited when I wore them for the first time, they fit well and the sound is great! I bought another pair as back up. These are perfect for me!"
4,not bad,"I think the headphones are good for the money. The sound is good, my only complaint is not enough bass. The thing I don't like about them is the cord is kind of short. I am about 6ft tall and when my mp3 is in my pocket it pulls on the headphones making it sometimes irritating."
4,Reasonably priced headphones that hold while running,I bought these to wear while exercising because those iPod ear buds are always falling out. These work just fine and are reasonably priced. I've bought three pair since they're so reasonably priced. Sound quality is fine.
2,"Almost perfect, but not quite.","I love these headphones. I really do. But they don't work for very long. I've probably owned about a dozen of these - back in 2003 or something, you could buy a pair and they would last you for a year. Around 05 or 06, the pairs generally started to last for around 4-6 months. I would gladly pay $30 dollars for these if they last for a year - they're that great."
2,Decent Sound Quality But Cord Too Short For Gym,"Headphone sound quality is decent. Extremely light weight.Being 6ft tall I found the cord to be way too short tohave iPod shuffle in my pocket. The cord is also slightlytoo short to plug into the cardio station at the gym.If you're 5' 10"" or taller, I do not recommend this product.Try Sony MDR-A35 instead."
2,nice fit for lack of sound quality,i really like the feel of them but i found out after i got them that i really needed a great sound. if you dont mind having not so great bass and heavy sound then you would like these. light as a feather.
5,Sony lightweight earphones,Hearing specialist don't prefer in ear buds and these are very convenient without going into the ear. Also very light and comfortable
5,Sony Ultra Lightwight Ear phones,"Out of all the earphones I have tried that go in the ear theae are without doubt the most comfprtable I have been using them for 5 years now ..They are light and can break easily if not taken care, of but they are cheap and sound quality is very good .."
5,old school but good sound,"I know these are a little outdated and yet out of the 3 pairs I bought, I only have one left. my daughter and grandson took two. they stay in the ear and are very comfortable even if you fall asleep with them."
4,Bang For Your Buck,"I use these for working out. I've put numerous ""active"" headphones through the gauntlet of my exercise regimen and now it's time to reflect on the MDR-W08L.- They fit rather comfortably and are extremely light. Rest assured, they won't weigh you down.- The sound is average, but the volume is more than you need for most applications.- The cord is a little short. Not an issue for me, but it may cause you some hiccups.Bottom line: For the price, I'm not sure you can find a better pair of headphones, particularly if you're an avid athlete. I've gone through countless ""active"" headphones from $15 to $75 that were unusable after only a few months of regular use. With the MDR-W08L, I have a reliable, bargain-priced, no-frills headphone. It gets the job done and I don't have to worry if I lose them. I'll just buy another pair."
3,Not good for children,"I bought these for my son, aged 12, and he broke them in a matter of days. That does not make this a bad product, but be aware that the ear bud portion of the headset will snap if you do not exercise proper care. Most likely my son stuffed the headphones in his backpack and the one ear bud snapped off. Totally his fault. Otherwise these earphones are great because they are lightweight, and unlike ear buds, will stay in place while you are running."
3,Ok but,It is ok but not real sturdy. Next purchase will be a stronger and more dependable one. Will not get this one again.
3,Disappointed,"These headphones are very light weight and they work well when I'm walking to work. I don't worry about them falling off or sliding down. The problem the sound was loud and clear for a few months, but now I can hear people speaking when I have my ipod blasting. For the few dollars I paid, I suppose I got my monies worth, however I had hoped they would have lasted a little longer.Sony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones"
5,Listening Great,"My company and I use this headset for transcription and scripting services where we sit with the headset for long and continuous hours with our computers. This is by far the most lightweight headset I have every used. It never sits heavy inside the ear. We cannot use ear buds, besides they are rough on the inner ear surface over time. We can hear more sounds with this set and they stay in place. It is perfect for our needs."
3,Practical and super lightweight!,Excellent product. The sound is something good average to good. They are fairly lightweight. The low depth is not very good. I recommend it for the convenience and light weight!
5,nice,Very light and flexible with good sound quality. Adjustable length is good. May be a little too flexible in the middle and loose its shape overtime.
3,Unreliability continues despite 8+ years of reports,"I just bought my third pair. Yes, they sound good, Yes, they are light and are ideal for running. Yes, they fail in the same way since 2003 (or earlier!). My first pair lasted many years, finally lost one channel. My second pair lasted less than one year, lost one channel. My third pair...well...Sony, listen up. It's a great product, but if you can figure out how to keep the wires connected to the plug, I'd pay the extra $0.50 to make that happen."
3,these don't stay on!!,Pros:- low price- decent sound quality- ultra lightweightCons:- these don't stay on when I am runningI got these after reading all the positive reviews about them being very stable while working out.But these headphones keep slipping out of my ears while I am jogging.
4,Great item at a great price,The headset was purchased to replace a headset for a a dictation machine. It works great. I had to turn the volume down on the machine because the sound was so much better than the old headset.
5,perfect headphones,I love these headphones. Earbuds fall out of my ears or make them feel plugged. These are hardly noticable.
5,Great for sensitive ears,"I have a really hard time finding headphones to use for running because everything is either too big or they rub after a few miles. These are the only thing I can tollerate over 5 miles because unlike earbuds, they dont make full contact with the inside of your ear. It's hard to see from the picture (and hard to explain) but the piece itself that goes into your ear is not round - it's a vertical and it rests in your ear. The tension from the headband holds them in place."
5,Great value for your money,I can't wear the in the ear type headphones and don't like the big bulky ones so these always work great!
3,Not as good as previous models,"Headphones with earbuds don't work well for me. They always fall out. I've had other Sony headphones in the past (with a jointed headband - those were great!) which all lasted at least a year. These are OK. They fit fine, but the headband part feels very flimsy. I don't predict a long life for these."
3,Ultra Lightweight is the operative description,"Untra Lightweight would be one description, flimsy is another. They sound ok, but, while putting them on or taking them off they bend every which way. They have not broken, they just have no physical substance."
2,Disappointing,They are so light weight I feel like I have to hold them on. The fit is odd too. The speakers face away from the ear canal. I guess I will keep looking for a good headset to run with.
4,Sony MDR-W08L - Simple and lightweight headphones,Bought these as an alternate to another set of headphones I'd worn out that went around the back of the neck. Price was great and they sound fine. I do prefer the around the neck style for what I use them for but the price couldn't be resisted. I'd recommend these.
3,Does basic job but wire connection breaks over time,"Use these for my workouts and they get thrown into my gym bag afterwards. I go through one of these almost every 6-9 months. They are not extremely durable because the wire leading into the earbuds eventually becomes loose and I end up losing sound in one ear bud, if not two, usually. Unfortunately I am one of those who cannot use ear buds while working out because they pop out all the time when I run; thus, I'm stuck with using over the head headphones. Fortunately they are cheap enough you can consider them disposable but it would be really nice if these were more rugged and durable. Same problem occurs with other manufacturers of the same style headphone. Audio quality is ok, not audiophile grade but does the job for a workout."
2,Podcasts or Audiobooks Only,"These headphones have lousy audio quality. There's almost no bass, they sound tinny, and they easily distort at higher volumes. They're good for spoken word, but not much else. And the cord just long enough to possibly fit my player into my pocket while these are on my head."
2,"If you are a runner, you will need to buy new pair every 3 months","I run 3-4 times per week. These headphones are good for a very light workouts, but not durable for the average runner. Spend the extra money and get a more quality set."
5,"Simple, yet amazing","I have had these headphones for many years now. The ONLY complaint is that they do not last more than 18 months. HOWEVER - the sound quality is INCOMPARABLE. Throw out your iPod ear buds, or the other earbuds. These Sony headphones will change the way you listen to music. For me - I am very active in the gym and need something that goes with me while I run or lift weights. The earbud types are constantly annoying to me. I visited Target recently and could not find the replacement for my most recent pair (BTW- they probably did not last longer only because they are sometimes kept in the heat of my car in FLORIDA) so I purchased the Sony earbud type and I couldn't STAND THEM. If you sweat, they will fall out of your ears and forget it if you run.Anyway, these Sony Headphones are the way to go. Don't let the price fool you. But you may want to buy two at a time, just in case!"
1,This is not good for me.,MDR-E828LP is a much better. I brought both. MDR-W08L is not comfortable. Feels like it is going to come off any second. Sound is not good. I will not buy this one again.
3,Good for the price...but could be better,"I've owned at least 5 pairs of these headphones in the past few years, and they are good, but definitely not great headphones.Pros:Sound is good (if you can get the buds to stay in your ears)Price is lowCons: The earbuds always fall out, so I have started wearing them with a hat over them to keep the buds in place and keep them from constantly falling out of my ears.Also, for extensive working out, the sweat seems to drip down the earpiece and pool in your ears, leaving you constantly taking them out to dry off the earbud and the inside of your ear.And, they can be very hit-and-miss. I've had 3 or 4 pairs where 1 ear completely stops working after a couple weeks, and then I have to find my receipt and take them back to the store to exchange them. But the pair I have now has lasted me for at least 6 months and both ears still work.But hey, for $8, they have decent sound quality, and you don't have to worry about losing them at the gym."
4,Bought again,Had them in the past for several years... lost them and got them again after trying other several options..Good souund quality...
4,Great for small ears....,"This is my 4th pair of earphones that I've purchased for my ZenV. all the others, especially the ones that just 'plug' into your ear were very uncomfortable, most didn't even fit in my abnormally small ears. so if you have small ears and are looking for something inexpensive (these headphones don't have the best sound, but are decent) these will do the job. Great for working out, they won't fall out!"
2,Ouch,"I'll do a simple pros-and-cons here, but will summarize by saying I was highly disappointedPros:Sound is excellent and rich. That's it.Cons:Very short cord.Buds pop out of the ear easily, although I had no trouble with the headset falling off.Difficult to place buds in the ear for good sound.Biggest negative: Rough edges (casting flash) on the earbuds require the development of ear calluses--a mere minute or two caused serious discomfort. Not acceptable.A couple of months later: After I did develop the required calluses, the band started to stretch, so they now fall off easily. Sigh."
2,Constantly readjusting them!,"I picked these up because I like to run and thought some lightweight headphones would be more comfortable for longer runs. I was wrong. These are indeed extremely lightweight but that's not a good thing. They never stay in place and I am constantly readjusting them. They always feel like they are about to fall off of my head. It's very annoying and I have already stopped using them for this reason.If you're considering some lighter headphones for working out with, it's just not worth it to save a gram here or there in weight. Headphones like these are never really heavy in the first place, so just get some normal ones and skip these.Sound quality was fine. I don't expect theater quality sound from any pair of cheap headphones."
4,Sony Headphones,The headphones are well made with a secure plug in to the walkman. The cords are the right size anddo not break. Tone quality is excellent and the unit is very easy to use.
4,Note the cord lenght before you buy Too short to use with gym equipment,"Bought them to be able to watch TV at the gym, cheap, small and light...Happy with the sound quality and comfort. Problem with the cord length. Not long enough to plug into the connection on the ARC Trainer at the gym and still move. Note the short cord lenght and know that if the connection is below your waist, this is probably not long enough for you to still move without tugging these off you head. Works fine for an ipod that I can wear and the short cord doesn't get caught up in the equipment."
1,THESE HEADPHONES ARE JUNK! SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I typically do not leave reviews on anything, much less a Sony item. I'm usually a big fan of Sony. These headphones however, are crap. They arrived, and right out of the box one ear does not work! WORTHLESS! So, in order to get my $8.63 back, I have to pack these up drive to UPS, and pay to ship them back. Not worth my time, effort, or money. Sometimes a cheap price just isn't worth it. You get what you pay for. I bought some JVC headphones for about $25 and they're great."
2,Flimsy,"These headphones are just 'ok'. the sound is ok, but they are a little flimsy and don't stay in place very well. They are not what I was expecting. The price was cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,"Look dorky, but get the job done.","These are about as basic a headphones as you can get. They certainly don't look too snazzy, but as a runner, they are perfect and stay in my ears, unlike earbuds. They aren't too sturdy, and will likely fall apart in 6 months like all headphones do, but for the price, it's worth it. Just don't expect the world."
5,Sticks on my head on even the longest runs,"I routinely buy Sony sound product for their crispness, these are no exception. They stay on while running into the wind and sound great."
4,Lightweight Headphone,Good Sound. Light weight. Plastic tends to wear out and not hold its shape as long as it used to. Still good value for the money.
2,nice but cheap,"I bought two pairs of these because I really liked how they fit and how good the sound quality was. Unfortunetly both pairs broke within two weeks. The first pair one of the cords ripped right out of the ear piece, and the second pair, one of the ear pieces doesn't have any sound now. I'm really disapointed that both pairs broke because I really liked them while they lasted."
2,"They work, but only for a few months","The fellow who indicated that they only work for a few months is absolutely correct. The wire they use for these headphones doesn't stand up to much wear. I've fixed a few pair, but it is a pain. Same problem every time. At any point where the cable is bent (1)where there is strain relief to mitigate this problem at the plug in side and (2) just inside the headpiece where the wire bends to get to the speaker, the wires will break within a few months. I also would pay $30 for them if they just lasted a year or more."
5,"Good Quality, But the cord is very short !","I like the headphone's design very much and the sound quality is good enough for the price. My only complain isthe extremely short cord, but in my case it's tall enough as I'm using it to watch movies and listen to music onmy laptop. so it's not a big deal.. nice work SONY (:"
2,don't perspire,"I liked everything about these headphones - the design, the lightweight feel, the comfort, the sound, etc - except for one thing. When running or exercising, the perspiration seemed to track right down the frame of the headphones and filled my ear with sweat. Once covered in sweat, they stopped working. I constantly had to take them off and wipe them off. I guess I'm going to have to go back to earphones that go in the canal and form a seal against water and sweat."
3,"good sound quality, but short cord","The sound quality and fit into my ears is great, especially given the price. The only problem is that the cord is too short to reach my MP3 player in my pocket. I'm fairly tall (6'2""), but if they could have just made the cord 6"" longer, I could have given this 5 stars."
2,I used to like thses a lot........,"I've had 3 or 4 pair of these and I thought they were awesome. I liked how they went into your ears as far as they did, there's a reason I've have 3 or 4 of these. One of the speakers kept getting static in it. And I had to keep adjusting them, not very good for working out. If you like that they are a in ear type style may I suggest spending a little more and going with the Creative Headphones EP-630. I used to like these Sony's a lot until I tryed the Creative ones, they are incredable. The bass is out of the world, and you don't have to adjust them even once and they are really comfortable. If you go for the Creative Headphones EP-630 you won't be dissapointed. If you like the in ear style, if you don't the Creative's are not for you."
1,As clear as mud,"While the design looks just like my older model the audio range is not the same. These are very muddy & tinny with a narrow range in sound. I should have double check the model # before ordering these. These will be my emergency backup headphones I guess, but I doubt I'll use them."
3,cord too short for the gym!!,I bought these to use on the cardio equipment at the gym. The cord that plugs into the gym/tv system attached to the machines is too short. It pulls out--or off my head--if I move too fast on the treadmill or elliptical machines.It's fine for a music player attached to my waist.
3,Adequate for price,"Sound quality and comfort are good. Cord is very short, which makes it difficult to use for the purpose intended."
2,I'm probably going to have to replace these,"They are ok when plugged into a PC, but at higher volume on an ipod, they tend to crackle. Also wish the wire was about 12 inches longer."
4,"Good deal, longtime user","I've used these headphones for about 10 years (many pairs). Whether they work for you depends on your intended use. These I've used for exercise, while I have a different, nicer pair, that I use for everything else. They are perfect for running, or any other exercise you can imagine. Cheap enough to take out into the elements or into the sauna. They aren't going to win any sound awards, but they sound way above average for a $10 set. Very lightweight and won't fall out of your ears like earbuds. The con is that they last as long as a $10 set. Depending on use they seem to last about a year. One of the two earphones will go out first, followed by the other. Not sure if this is a flaw or merely because of the sweat that gets into them and the general rough treatment I give them. Would recommend as good exercise headphones."
5,Finally! Earphones that don't pop out of my ears when I run!,"After years of frustration with earbuds that pop out of my ears while running and walking, I got these headphones. They're great - lightweight and they stay put! Sound quality is good too."
5,Works for me,"I typically use my iPod at the gym while working out. I have small ears and can't use earbuds; I have yet to find a pair that will stay in my ears, so I am constantly readjusting earbuds and usually can't hear well.These headphones are light, comfortable and stay in my ears. Typically I listen to podcasts rather than music, and the sound quality is more than adequate for that.I have used this type of headphone in the past, and they do have a finite life, but then again they are fairly inexpensive. This time I bought two pair so I have a spare if the first set breaks."
1,Defective wiring- don't buy,"I have owned two pairs of these headphone. Each pair has developed the same problem after about 90 days (just after the warrantee period). The right headphone speaker shorts out and stops working. After taking both pairs apart I found that Sony knots the wire inside the headphone to prevent it from coming out but in the process damages the wires inside causing a short. My advice, don't waste you money on these."
5,These ear buds rock!,I've tried several earbuds but they all fall of when excersising. These stay on and the sound pretty good. I'm definitly sticking with these ones!
3,"good, cheap headsets. If they folded would be great!","These headsets are really inexpensive and the sound quality is pretty good. They are decently built but with light plastic, so they are really breakable. The biggest drawback is they don't fold up like other models do, so you have to take extra precautions when traveling or taking to the gym in a bag. Other models will cost atleast twice as much, so if u wanna get some headsets but not looking to spend much these are the way to go."
3,Perfect for running! Durability...???,"I find these headphones perfect for running. Sound quality is pretty decent, they are lightweight and comfortable, great price; they get the job done. However, my one complaint is durability. I have just ordered my third pair as the circuitry eventually fails and sound in one ear eventually dies. I'm not abusing the headphones too much when I work out, but I seem to only be able to get a few months of use out of them. But hey you get what you pay for, and truthfully at this price and considering the pro's, I'll probably buy a forth pair if need be should the next set fail. But who knows maybe third times a charm! 4.5 stars had the previous two sets not died."
5,lightweight impressive headphone for hiking,"This is a very nice lightweight headphone. Very good feeling since doesn't push into the ears. No pain after use.Very good for hiking/ running. Wish could use for biking too, but doesn't go well with the bike helmet. Not designed to be used around the neck.Overall it has an amazing quality, good sound and most importantly much lighter than it looks. Like it and recommend."
5,Best headphones for sound quality & price,"I've purchased these headphones for years & I feel that they are the best headphones for the money. The sound quality is excellent and they are very durable. They fit comfortably over the head and in the ears, NOT like the earbuds. Don't hesitate to purchase these headphones!"
4,Good for air travel,"Lightweight and easy to use, good behind your neck on the airplane, compact and simple to store in carryons, good sound quality even though it doesn't fit like an ear bud. Well worth the cost."
2,Less than satisfied,"I feel like the lone ranger here giving this product a less than glowing review, but that's what reviews are for, right? I found this headset to be very light and flimsy. One side worked about 80% and the other side about 40%. I was in the process of returning the item, but Amazon said no need. Since I was ""a valued customer"", I could keep the item and they'll refund the money anyway. Two thumbs up for Amazon!!!"
3,they sound distant,"headphones fit funny in ears, sound distant, and have too much bass. they sound good for sub $10 headphones, but i'm only giving them 3 stars because you are better off saving your money for something that costs a little more but sounds and feels much better."
1,A far cry from the MDR-A44L,These headphones are extremely flimsy and lack the kick needed to accurately reproduce music and even speech. The Sony MDR-A44L was the benchmark of the vertical in-the-ear design. It's a shame that Sony discontinued the MDR-A44L in favor of the overly cheapened MDR-W08L.
2,not the retro headphones you think,"Just got these headphones figuring they would feel and sound like the sony walkman headsets of old but they do not. Cheap feeling plastic, thin sound, no bass and strange wire exit from the speakers make the headset a sub par replica. They are not worth a penny more than 5 bucks. Its not worth going through the hasstle of returning, so I'll just keep them as a backup. Guess I have to deal with the modern earbud style to get decent sound quality. Oh well."
2,You Get What You Pay For,I should have known but I'm a slow learner. I've had this pair in the past and forgot how I didn't like them. It produces a hollow sound that lacks stereo. I'm getting used to it and they will work until they get broken. THEN I'll buy a pair that works a lot better.
4,Option to Ear Buds,"This is my third or fourth pair of these headphones. As other reviewers have said, they do not last long. A pair may last a year or sometimes only a few months when one side of the phones will lose sound or the sound will go in and out. I continue to buy them because ear buds do not fit in my ears, or fall out when running. It's annoying. These headphones are comfortable, produce great sound for my purposes, do not fall out, and are really inexpensive. If 10 bucks last me a year, then it's money well spent."
1,Headphones,Unhappy with this purchase because the small ear plugs were uncomfortable for me. Gave it to my wife who seems happy with it.
3,"Super light, durable. Does not stay in ears","I bought these headphones specifically for running, so I was pretty disappointed. In-the-ear buds have never stayed in my ears while I run, so I was looking forward to getting this pair with the wrap around. While yes, they are very light, and can be banged around in my bag without any damage because they're so flexible, they do NOT stay in my ears. If I'm sitting on the couch they're fine and feel pretty snug. But when running, they inch their way out.Even when I'm not moving, I can't say that these are the most comfortable headphones. It's hard to adjust them to just the right size. Because they're so flexible, you can tug on them quite a bit to fit your head, and then they'll pop back up eventually. So it takes some fiddling with to find the right length."
4,Sony headphones,"The Sony headphones are very light, adjustable and comfortable. The most important thing is that they stay in place even when I move."
1,Cheap in all respects,I almost skipped this product due to the low price and what I assumed would be poor sound quality. Unfortunately I was fooled by the good reviews and place an order. The sound quality really is poor. I had the volume on up to full on my ipod and could barely hear the music over the background noise in the gym. What little I could hear was tinny and barely recognizable as music. This is not an anti-Sony rant - I have gone back to my tried and trusted (but more expensive) Sony MDR-AS20J. They are double the price but 10 times the quality.
5,Great fit and sound!,I use headphones and earbuds when running. Earbuds won't stay in and headphones are cumbersome. These lightweight headphones are PERFECT! They stay put and I can't believe the sound for such an inexpensive product. You can't go wrong.
5,Wow,"Very pleasantly surprised at the sound quality of these inexpensive headphones. Very lightweight- perfect for almost any workout, and again, wow, the sound is truly amazing.I have a pair of Bose noise canceling headphones I use for the plane, and these are within a 2% range of sound quality- but when used in a fairly quiet gym. But for eight bucks- one cannot go wrong!"
2,These headphones don't stay in!!,"I bought these headphones b/c they were reviewed in Shape magazine. It was said that they stay in place and you barely even notice you're wearing them. WRONG! These headphones drift out of my ears as I run, and it's completely random as to which side will stay in. Sometimes both sides pop out! It's so frustrating and annoying as I'm running to constantly be pushing them back in. The sound is great when both earpieces are actually in my ears, but that is rarely the case! Beware!"
2,lost them recently and glad I did,"they sound ok, except what good it's for if earpieces constantly fall out and the head band won't stay put. And how could it be otherwise the way they are build as little speakers rigidly facing forward. I saw some reviewers claiming the opposite, but I think they got confused about the product they are reviewing, or else they have heads shaped to special Sony specifications. I finally lost them somewhere to which I could only say: good riddance."
4,Comfortable quality with durability issues,"I have been using this model headphone easily 10 years. I tried 2 similar Sony sport models costing twice as much and the headbands broke within 1 week and no improvement in audio quality. The lightweight design allows for extended usage without ear fatigue or irritation to the outer ear. In the summer while mowing the grass or bike riding sweat will clog the sound holes or cause an un-equalizing seal in the ear, must dry it off and move on! As far as durability I agree with James a good pair could last nearly a year but 2 or 3 months is more realistic. I feel that there has been a decrease in quality over the years. But the $9.99 price makes these headphones a disposable product! It would be nice if Sony would fix this problem. After my experience with a Sony MD player these headphones are the only Sony product that I will buy. For more critical listening try Yamaha RH5MA Headphones $59.99."
2,Basic iPod/MP3 headphones - nothing more,"These headphones are definitely a bottom tier set. The frequency response is poor at both ends of the spectrum and everywhere in between. The sound reproduction quality is muddy. They distort badly at a relatively low volume. They still beat ear pods which for me, are an abomination. Keep a set handy for those times when your others are broken or ""lost"" somewhere in your home or auto."
2,don't fit in my ear,"I wanted earbuds on a light headband, but these don't fit in my ear far enough to hear the sound well, and are quickly uncomfortable in my ear too."
4,Delicate Ear Piece,"Great sound, light weight, stays in place good when on the treadmill. I really like the quality of the overall headpiece. I am a little concerned about durability. The sound reproduction is great. Recommended for those who want an inexpensive headpiece."
4,surprisingly satisfied for the price,"I would give this a 5 because for the price, I'm extremely happy with these. They're lightweight, produce wonderful sound quality, and I can sort of use them at the gym. There is a flaw that they do kind of get looser when I'm using them on the treadmill, so the music gets softer and softer as I work out. But they're also really comfortable to wear and I can always just push it back in my ears after a while."
5,Since 1997 I've bought only these,"You might not belive me, but it's true. I even scrambled up a pair in Australia when I steped on my old ones. I've gone through 6 or 7 pair (not because they stopped functioning--only because they met with unfortunate ends like being chewed by a rabbit). I'm now buying an 8th pair because my Mom has decided to keep the pair I lent her. These headphones have a terrific sound, they are light-weight, The headband is completely flexable and impossible to break, and they are good for people with small heads as the headband part is really small. My Mom has never had headphones that would fit her head. Hence the reason she stole mine!"
1,Not comfortable!,Not impressed. I went out to a store and found a much more comfortable pair of headphones. Ordering this particular product was a futile waste of my time. They are now just sitting on a shelf collecting dust!
1,Should've used the money to buy lunch,"It's about $7 for a reason...Unless you hate using the headphones offered by airlines, do NOT buy this item. Wayyyyy too loose; felt like having a a large shopping bag handle behind my head, the audio wasn't loud enough to drown out the crowd/train nose in the subway; at all, and just by looking at it you can tell that a newborn could break it in half. Audiophiles, beware of this item."
1,Only were good for 3 months!,"I run with my headphones one, and this model was not good for that! after 3 months, only one side worked."
1,disappointment with Sony MDR W08L-Headphones,"It is very light. The sound is ok. But it does not stay over my head, I can hardly do much when I wear it, no way for work out or jogging."
4,Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones,This is my second set of these headphones. I had the fist set over two years but some fluid got into one of the ear pieces so I purchased another set. I use these all the time while exercising at the gym. I like the fact that they never fall out of your ear like individual earbuds do from time to time if you work up a good sweat.
5,Great headphones for the price.,I love these headphones. They're lightweight and the sound quality is great for the price. Very comfortable too....
3,Very Average,"I've had a pair of these Sony MDR-W08 phones for a few months, and I think they're just...okay. The sound quality is alright, but not very brilliant, rich, or satisfying. For comparison, I bought these to replace a set of standard Apple earbuds that came with my iPod Shuffle; to my ears, the Apple earbuds were superior in sound reproduction.My other issue is that the speakers don't stay put in my ears when I'm running. They keep slipping out every minute or two, and that can drive you crazy.For (...), these are not a bad deal, and they're probably fine if you're not going to do anything super-active. But I'm going to look for something better soon, for sure."
3,The cord is too short for me,"I need the cord to be about 3.9 feet - this cord is only 3.3 feet. I also would like to have volume control. I don't think these fit in the ears very well. I only bought these because I was desperate, since I don't like anything currently on the market. I also own Sennheiser PX 10 headphones, which do have volume control, but also have a cord that is too short. I wish Panasonic still made the lightweight In-the-ear headphones RP-HS35 (no longer available)."
4,NIce Lightweight Headphones,These are great headphones.Pros:lightweightstay in your earsclear soundCons:they feel like the plastic is going to snapthey take some time to get used tothe cable is a bit shortoverall: these are a great deal and are esp. good for exercising since they won't fall out and are very lightweight.
2,I just hate the way they fit.,"The sound quality on these headphones are not bad, but the way they fit irritates me. I have a normal sized head and they fit so loose you would swear they were made for not a human but perhaps a moose instead. I haven't had the full affect of the sounds because they barely tickle my ears. I bought these becase I don't really like ear buds, but I didn't want bulky head phones while exercising either. What a mistake. Next time I will go in to an actual store to purchase some headphones a bit more snug. Other than that they came in when they said they would and they were in the condition described. I love amazon, hate the headphones I bought. Oh and the return policies are horrid..."
1,Broke right away,"Used about 3 or 4 times, and sound now only comes out of one ear. Too much hassle to return."
3,Breaks easily,I use mine every day. The only problem with them is one of the speakers will die within about 2 months of using them. Luckily I have a warranty so I could get new ones for free (for 2 years)
3,Uncomfortable,"I'm a court reporter and I purchased these headphones because I wanted a pair of lightweight headphones that I could rest on my neck and use in a hurry for bench conferences at trial.Before these headphones I was just using earbuds, but I didn't like fooling around for an extra ten seconds trying to untangle cords and figuring out which bud goes in which ear. Every second counts in court reporting!-- Positives: They are lightweight and easy to slip on and off my ears quickly.-- Negatives: They are not comfortable at all.They start to hurt after 30 minutes of solid use. I guess it's lucky for me that bench conferences don't typically last too long."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"These are as cheap and flimsy as anything I've ever owned. Sound quality is decent but I don't think they will last with daily use. Also the cord is too short for my taste. Anyway, that's my 2 cents which is what these are worth."
4,Ultralight,Pro's: so light and comfortable you'll forget you're wearing it; good sound and bassCon's: flimsy construction so handle with care; doesn't block out ambient noise around you
5,Jenny,"These headphones are light weight and keep the music right where I want it when I jog; not too loud, easy to hear with surrounding noise, but also allows me to hear my environment."
4,Good but they do not fold,I have several Sony headphones over the years. I really like the little fold up plastic ones. This headphone does not fold; it does adjust to head size. It works well. The material it is made of seems like it will last longer than most since the plastic is flexible and not brittle.
3,Perfect for Running....,"I received these promptly within 2 days, and couldn't wait to try it on my daily run (I as many here HATE ear buds, as I have to keep pressing them back in, and over the ears just shift around). When I first plugged em into my iPod, all I got was static and I was pretty pissed, I gave it a wiggle and it worked with a little static remaining. I decided what the hell, I cant return em now so I gave em a shot, and the static cleared completely up, and it worked perfectly as soon as I got outside. It was great, I didn't have to adjust a thing the entire run! Even jumping over pot holes and cobble streets, they stayed in!"
2,"Bought these twice, and twice failed!","I really like the feel of these, most headphones hurt my head or ears, but these don't. However after my first pair failed in the right ear, I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt. Now on my second pair, and the right ear failed again! I was happy with them the first time, but now I would NOT recommend these to anyone."
5,Absolute favorite headphones!,"I've used this type of headphones for at least 3 years now, and I love them! I have small ears, so earbud headphones hurt my ears. These earphones go in the ears, but are not too large. As other reviews mention, I did have a pair go bad on me, this was after maybe a year of use. I mainly wear these while exercising. I made sure to order 3 pairs of these after my first pair went out, I want to have backups on hand. Really great headphones for the price."
5,Good design,Arrived promply. Good design for a great price. Sound quality is good.Would recommend this product Good for excersizing stays on
4,Excellent Headphones,I use these with my ipod classic. They transmit sound well and stay put during runs. They are also super lightweight and fairly durable (I've dropped them a few times).
3,for the price...yes,"the sound quallity is not so great and am not sure how you are suppose to fit them in your ears. I bought them for my boyfriend and it was an embarassment, i ended up taking them and buying them another set. Bottom line you get what you pay for."
5,These are the best headphones,These are the best headphones I have ever used. I never want to be without a pair of these headphones. They are very comfortable and they have just the right cord length. They have great sound quality also. I definitely recommend these!
4,Sony Headphones - MDR-W08,Still one of the best fitting and best value headphones. I buy 'em 10 at a time for my children.
3,2 Months Tops,"These headphones are great...for the length that they work. I run everyday so I depend heavily on my ipod---& the headphones being top notch go without saying. & for the time being, these are great--mind you at $8 you cant expect much. Regardless the sound quality is awesome....but dont expect them to work past 2 months. You will surely find that only one ear piece works while the other is silent."
5,SON OF ZEUS THESE ARE AMAZING!!!!,SO I JUST RECEIVED THESE AND HOLY CHRIST THESE ARE THE BEST HEADPHONES I HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN MY LIFE!!!! THEY ARE LITERALLY FEATHERWEIGHT AND SO GD SNUG ITS UNFREAKINGBELIEVABLE LIKE COME ON IM LIKE TOOOOO IMPRESSED....SOUND QUALITY...ITS SONY NUFF SAID AND I BOUGHT THESE FOR RUNNING AND THEY STAY IN PLACE AND CAN'T BE BEAT!!!
5,Excellent headphones!!,"I've never really loved ear buds, but that is just about all you can find in stores these days. I had a pair of vertical headphones years ago that I loved. I was on a mission to find another pair. I came across these and ordered them immediately. I tried them out as soon as I received them in the mail, and let me say, these have amazing sound quality! I can't believe I used ear buds for years, only to realize I wasn't getting the best sound from them. I love that these stay in my ears while running, and they stay on my head! I hope they never stop making this style, because I can't see myself ever going back to ear buds!!"
4,Great for running,"These are the only in-the-ear headband headphones on the market that I could find. They last about 8 months and then one ear loses sound, but at the low price, they are still worth the purchase."
3,Very Comfortable,"These headphones are great in the gym because they don't fall out of my ears and don't make me sweat around the ears. The only negative thing I can say is: For a couple of pennies more, Sony could have made the cord about 12"" longer."
2,wouldn't buy again,Sound was crackling and the band part of headphones was so flimsy they barely stayed in place. I gave them to a friend and she uses them with her Kindle and loves them. They didn't work well with my ipod to use at the gym.
1,Truly awful,"These headphones are truly awful. They are not worth it for any price. They sounds exceptionally bad, are not at all comfortable and don't stay put. I replaced them withSennheiser PMX 685i SPORTS In-Ear Neckband Headphones - Blackwhich fit well in my ears, sound good and don't shift around at all. They also have a button and a mic allowing for phone calls etc."
1,headphones,the headphones didn't fit the cd player I bought them for so I can't use them. I'm thinking about giving them to some one who can use them.
5,Perfect for what they are,"I bought these for when I walk the dog or (I am still trying to convince myself) go for a jog. They stay put in the ear, are comfortable, but don't block out external noise, which is exactly what I wanted. I can hear any approaching vehicles on my country roads (and hold the dog so he doesn't chase them). Would buy again."
3,Good while they last,"I order these regularly because earbuds fall out of my ears when I run. I like the fit of these, but they only last about 6 months and then stop working. (In my experience.) I can't find any others that will stay put while running though, so I keep buying them."
4,good headphones,Let's face it headphones short out.These will last as long as any fifty dollar pair.The price is great and they are so comfortable.You can run with them.They are the best I've tried.
3,"Worked as advertised,",Work as advertised. Works well for the gym. I would buy this product again. Hate to have to use twenty-year words to review this
3,"Decent, but not great...","I bought this to replace the Radio Shack Optimus folding headphones (which I can no longer seem to find) which I'd used for the past dozen years. While these Sony headphones are inexpensive, the sound is thin in comparison. The Optimus had more clarity, better bass and more depth of sound. So, not a bad set of headphones for the price, but not as good as I was hoping."
4,Excellent Value,"Good headset! it's very comfortable, has good sound quality, and is much easier to clean than ones with rubber/foam ear pieces. I have bought 4 sets, in the last 7 months. Not as replacements, but so I wouldn't have to plug/unplug with my different music sources.My only complaint is that wire tangles- like all ear pieces.Highly recommend."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.....DO NOT BUY!!!,"When I purchased these headphones I looked at the reviews first. There were some who liked it and some who didn't, because it did not last long. So I took a chance and that chance has cost me! I had these headphones for about four months before the headphones gave out on me. The sound was good, it fits in my ear comfortably, and they did not break. I used these head phones almost everyday. So I have to give this review and convince you.........DO NOT BUY!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL LAST FOR YEARS AND NOT MONTHS!!! Because you will end up throwing your money away!"
4,super light but lack of bass,"This earphone arrived in 3 days free delivery. The sound clarity is good, sound quality towards the high frequency part with lacks of bass if compared to my other earphones of the same size driver. Since it is super light, I didn't feel much pressure on my ears at all while it is snug in the ear. It should be good for listening especially when exercising where strong body movement are expected."
3,Cord too short,"The sound is not bad and they are very light, but the cord is so short that if you have your player in your pocket and are on the treadmill, the cord will get yanked out of the player. This happened to me a few times. If you have your player on an arm band it should be fine."
4,Lightweight Headphones,"These are fine headphones. Very lightweight and comfortable. The wire coming off the left side tends to get in the way, so I secured it down with a twist tie. The top part does feel a bit flimsy, but I've had this type of headphones before, and that doesn't really become a problem. I've only used them for a little over a month, so time will tell how rugged and durable they are. Regardless, the price was amazing (much cheaper than in the stores), so I'm not going to complain if they do wear out during the summer... I'll just buy another."
2,Lousy fit,"These are meant to be sport headphones. The molded plastic band prevents the buds from staying in the ears completely as either one or the other will pop out. I tried bending the band in several places to improve the angle but the ""memory"" of the plastic band restores itself and one of the buds will exit the ear. These would probably fit someone with a larg head just fine."
4,Great price but needs to be replaced after 6 months of hard use,"I use these headphones for all my runs. They are lightweight and stay on my head and in my ears after miles and miles of pounding. They do not seal off all sound from the surrounding environment, which makes them safer for runners who need to stay aware of their surroundings. On the downside, these headphones always seem to stop working after about 6 months of use. That's not a big deal given how inexpensive they are, but it's a bit annoying."
1,"Cheap, flimsy & poor sound","I've worn Philips turbo bass heandband headphones for years while running and for hours at work. Their new design is excruciatingly uncomfortable so I needed to look elsewhere. Ordered these since the reviews were good and they were inexpensive.Very disappointed. These are very cheaply made and the sound is horrible. Very flimsy, and I don't believe they'd hold up well. You get what you pay for.However, I also ordered Sony MDR-AS35W headphones ($25-$30) to try as well. I highly recommend paying the extra money for those - well worth it. Good sound quality (comparable to Turbo bass) and extremely comfortable. I've worn mine all day at work for a couple of weeks. I'll be order more of those."
3,Decent,"Not bad for the price. I'm not sure why when I bought these I thought they were behind the ear type headphones, but they are not. They're nice for the gym because they don't have foam pads to get wet and they're also not too expensive like many of the other options for gym headphones out there. Also, I find the cable to be just a bit short, but it hasn't been a problem for me yet."
3,The fit either works or doesn't work,"These are an excellent value, but due to their unusual design, they may not fit your head. I have a large head, and no matter how I try to adjust them, they just don't stay in my ears when I move around, so I find them useful only for static situations.When I stay still, they aren't bad. But I don't stay still for long. So, 3 stars."
2,Feel cheap and will break before long,"These headphones feel very cheap and flimsy. The sound quality is great with a good low end (bass), and they are certainly more durable than they feel. But they are cheaply made and will not last. The left earphone became temperamental and eventually stopped working altogether. I believe this is due to the wiring not being securely attached - it is probably cheaply soldered with no other support.The most frustrating thing is that the warranty is for 90 days and this is how long mine lasted. A replacement pair would probably break also. Don't be tempted by the price like i was - put the money towards something of better quality."
2,How does this stay in your ears?,"I have smaller ears and ear buds really don't work for me. So hearing all the great reviews, I bought it. This kinda sticks in one ear, and then falls out of the other, particularly if I move at all.. or chew. Forward-facing, vertical in- ear style might have been ok if it actually fit in.."
2,No Bass,"No bass, OK for voice, but otherwise a cheap pair of headphones. I wish Sony would make a better quality pair of headphones in this style, over the head, small and collapsible for running or traveling."
3,Good Overall,"I was sure it would break in a week because of the cheap feel you get just wearing them, but hey, they're still around and fit/work fine. The sound is super weak though."
4,This is my third pair,"Not because there's anything wrong with them... because I like to have a pair for my wife to use on the treadmill, another for me at home and the third pair at my office. They have an open design so they're not so anti-social to use. However, don't plan on using these in a noisy environment (e.g. train) as the outside noise will drown them out.The two older pair that I have are white with orange trim, but it's the same model number and they look and sound the same, which of course is great. The cord is a bit on the short side so don't plan on using them far from your music source."
5,Wow !!!,Great sound for your money !!! I love these Sony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones ..... the sound is impeccable !!!!
5,Perfect headphones for me,"I can't stand in the ear buds, as my ears are too small and they constantly fall out. These are a great solution, they stay in place and don't move. Even when I'm running. And they're small and light enough to carry around with me every day."
3,Get what you pay for,"Better than no music while running, but not much! the flop around a bit and arent tight in your ears, so i find myself squashing them down to mke the music louder. fills the billet though and cheap as heck"
5,Love these headphones!!!!!,I do not like ear buds to begin with and they would always fall out when I ran.. I decided to purchase these after reading the reviews and they are great! Sound quality is awesome and they are very light weight.. AND they do not fall out when you run!
2,cheap,what you pay its what you get. thats all i have to say for this product. thanks for reading. l
4,"Fun, when you're bored.","This game was pretty fun. All you have to do is draw new cards or swap them with other players, so everyone can play - even your grandparents who know nothing about HSM! But as the game doesn't require any thinking or strategies, it gets boring if you play it all the time. And it's only limited to 4 players."
3,"Okay, but not for Hypercard Veterans",This book was basically about how to do simple things like buttons and painting. Though near the end the book does delve into good things like fiel manipulation. I'm ordering Volume II because that looks more promising. Mainly a referance book!
4,Classic Bossa Nova Duo,"Gal and Caetano are a great duo. I am not as knowledgable as one of the other reviewers, but there is obviously a great chemistry between the two. This is a relaxing disc-- even the fast songs are gently tropical. I'm a big fan of Caetano Veloso's songs, and they comprise two-thirds of the disc. Gal Costa has the right sound for these songs, too. Her voice seems to float on top of the music. The liquid purity of their voices matches beautifully, as well as the easy flexibility of their rhythm. They each sing some on their own, and a couple together, notably Corao vagabundo. Others songs than particularly stand out for me are Domingo, Nenhuma dor, Remelexo, Minha senhora , Quem me dera and Maria Joana. Text of the songs only in Portuguese, but the English notes translate three of them."
2,Buyer beware,"This album is not all its cracked up to be. What they do not tell you is that each song listed averages about 2 minutes in legnth, just as you get into a song it slowly fades away. In addition to the shortness of the songs, many of the songs are backed by an annoying arrangement of strings so typical of the verve label."
2,A story better told out loud.,"While the narrative of a young girl growing up in the Third Reich and later the DDR is an interesting an helpful perspective on the conditions under authoritarian regimes, Bloomfield's account is awkwardly narrated with many blatant translation, grammar, and spelling issues. An interesting read, but not a very scholarly source."
5,This is a good sign,"It's a very good, standard sign. The for sale sign. Everyone who wishes to sell something should own at least one of these. I bought ten and sprinkle them around the house, to remind me to sell stuff. Solid sign."
4,"Season 3, still doing well","I was very much captivated with the first season. Things have gotten a little confusing with everyone trying to screw almost everyone else over but working towards the same goals, main characters being terminated and the general slight disaray and escewed perception of stories. With the last episode of series three returning almost to early premise of the show. It clearly shows the difference in writing from Gene to others with too much intregue. Gene, as in his other programs ie Star Trek, he was trying to convey that how much we seem to be different, we are more alike than we realize."
4,A good start,"The first season of Earth: Final Conflict is finally being released on DVD, and I think the show deserved it.This first season was really a good start for the series : deep characters, interesting plots... However, something went wrong from season 2 and the quality of the show considerably decreased, especially with one main character being killed each season.But despite this, the beginning was full of promises and this season makes the show an intelligent science-fiction series. I recommand it to everyone interesting in good sci-fi series. Just don't expect too much of the following seasons."
3,Existen Fan's Scifi que no Hablan Ingles,"Esta Serie es Bien Interesante, plantea las relaciones en terminos de amistades y conflictos de una forma bien realista, mas que los efectos, aqui lo que vale son los dialogos y situaciones. Pero, como en muchos Lanzamientos de DVD, olvidan a los Hispano Parlantes, la segunda lengua mas hablada en el mundo, detras del mandarin. esto sin dejar de lado a otros fanaticos como son portugeses, italianos, francese. etc. Cuando empezaran a pensar en que existen personas en este planeta que no hablan ni entienden ingles. Gracias."
5,First Season Coming Out In UK in April,I love this entire series from season one to five. It is progressive in its nature and leaves you curious 'til the very end.I noticed that season 1 is being released in the UK on April 3 2006. It should not be long before it is available in the US and Canada. Season 2 will be hopefully not too far behind...
4,Previous Review is false.,"Actually this is season 3 on, Universal decided not to release the first and second season due to their owning of it, basically they just sit on it. But season three is as good a place to start as any.Earth: Final Conflict will be a great addition to your scifi collection. It features a deep plot with good quality acting on the part of the main charactors. I am sure you will fall in love with this series as much as i did"
4,Devine Animal tarot,"Is a great Tarot set. Very in depth, with beautiful artwork on the cards. I sent it to my sister who is a great animal lover as a gift."
3,Nice Pictures but,"This is my first set of tarot cards, so I am not really quilified to write a review but this is what I think at this point. I wish the cards had more of a message/meaning written on the cards instead of in the book.I was drawn to these cards because of the animal motif, and think the drawings are great. I also find it a nuisance to try to keep these cards in the order the book talks about, it takes away from any spontaneity and gives the cards more of a rigid feeling."
3,Good If Your Female,"The deck is great if you're female but it's not so good if your a man. Not saying I can't use the deck, I can but I have a hard time with how unbalanced the energies are with this deck.The challenge card made me deduct another star because I thought it was pretty pathetic to be frank and I couldn't get anything out of it. I found that this artist has a hard time with dark imagary and it's almost sad because she's a really good artist as a whole."
5,Truly Divine,"I bought this Deck because of how beautiful it is,it has now become my favorite.When I do my readings they have such a serene feel to them,which makes them so much easier to read.It's as this Deck wants to be read."
5,Excellent Resource for Parents of Teens,"This book has a Christian theme, but can be very helpful to any parent of teens. The Arps are well known for their marriage seminars, and this book is another great work of theirs. They discuss rites of passage, giving appropriate gifts and new levels of trust and responsibility as the child goes from preteen to teenager. A great idea from the book is a box for each birthday that has multiple items in it, like a house key or car keys--items that have obvious meanings of maturity attached to them.The book helps you relate to your child and help them, including backing off and staying away when necessary, as they begin preparing to leave the nest. Excellent reference resource to keep on hand to help you as a parent love and nurture your teen through thick and thin, zits and all. Two thumbs up!"
5,Fabulous CD by one of America's Greatest Songwriters,"Paul Overstreet wrote the songs, other top artists made them hits. But this CD features the hits that he wrote, songs EVERYONE is familiar with - sung by the songwriter himself. Paul has taken his classics like Randy Travis' 'Diggin' Up Bones' and turned it into a rockin' bluesy tune you'll want to play again and again. The song 'When You Say Nothing At All' from the movie Notting Hill, and lots of number one hits that he wrote are on this CD. Buy it. It's well produced. It's a classic. It will become your new favorite. It is mine."
3,Not hilarious,My kids gave this to my mother for Christmas. She read it here at my house and didn't laugh once. :o/ I was bummed.
5,A stunning book of a remarkable sculptor,I bought this book as a gift and am thrilled that I did. Noguchi's work is utterly remarkable and so is this book!
2,Very Disappointing,"I read the entire book in an hour. Lots of pictures and other filler. There was virtually no information on tuning. The book was mostly just a product brochure for diablo's products and how they work. If you want to know how their products work then this book would be fine for that. I found tons more useful information on actual tuning for free on www.fordfuelinjection.com. As a an example the book would say, ""the tuner modifies the fuel table to achieve maximum performance"". Well no duh! I was hoping to see a bit more detail than that."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"This book covers very basic information about tuning. There is no actual tuning information. It's just a glossed over description of how engines work and minimal information on performance tuning. The cover states ""This is the first complete guide to electronic performance tuning of Ford vehicles"". BS.....this is not a guide to tuning. There is a section covering Diablo tuners and how they work. Hmmmmm, wonder if this section was included because the author has an interest in the company? There is a section on cooking the author's favorite recipes...WTF!!! If I wanted a cook book, I would have bought one. I want my money back.........not worth the price!"
4,"Good info, but it leaves you wanting more...","Although titled ""Ford Tuning Secrets Revealed"" this book does a better job of explaining the how the Ford EEV-IV and V control modules are designed, communicate, and work in general--general being the key word.The book is a series of treatises, written by several authors, each of which presents a tuning related topic in manners ranging from almost ""advertorial"" like to somewhat detailed discussions of tuning related stuff. The ""tuning related"" part is what left me wanting more; if you are looking for tips, hints, and gotchas that will help you tune your Ford then look elsewhere, there is very little if any of that sort of info in this book.Overall I am pleased with the content, but be aware it is at times presented in very broad strokes..."
5,The Curbside Mechanic,"This book was a great help.The diagrams are easy to follow and the directions clean and clear for each step. It's great to get a book written for the weekend mechanic, that is helpful and encourages we amatures in the field. This book is worth the cost.My savings on labor should pay for all my after market upgrades. j.sigler"
5,Great Book and lots of easy to follow diagrams,"I'm a woman who loves cars, especially Fords. This book is an easy-to-understand guide. There are diagrams and illustrations that explain in detail everything you want to know. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to better understand the Ford engine."
3,Warranty,Hi Im from venezuela..I have 3 questions..the first is if the MP3 is Apple??..the second is the MP3 Player has ear phone?? and the third question is that I want to know if the MP3/Mp4 has warranty..if the answer is afirmative I would like to know if the warranty could be used out from USA??...speciffic used in venezuela..If yes please let me know the specif place where I can go in venezuela for it..Thanks...
4,Keep it's charge...,I would plan on buying at least two of these to have on hand. I have three of them and even after numerous charges they are still very strong.
2,Not a Canon battery,This is not a Canon battery as implied - it is a third party battery. So far it seems to work ok but cheaper non-Canon batteries are available.
1,Price is good for entry level but its loud,"Price is good for an entry level lens but personally I really disliked it. I returned it after taking a couple test photos, the focusing with the lens is in my opinion is louder than acceptable. I returned this and purchased the 50mm f1.4 lens."
2,Not too good.,"I returned this lens and got the Sigma 50mm. There's a reason the Sigma is more expensive, it takes better photos. Don't waste your precious photographic moments with this Canon lens. You can have better bokeh, more clarity and less distortion with the Sigma. Also, if you have other 77mm filter sized lenses, the you can share your polarizer, ND and UV filters with the Sigma 50mm f1.8 instead of buying a whole new set for this little Canon lens. A good polarizer, UV and a couple NDs will end up costing you the price difference."
2,"cheap, but cheap","save your money for the 1.4..plastic build and really hit or miss on quality.my friend loves this thing, but i hated it. after selling it to him, i picked up the 1.4 version (i know 3x the price..) and it made a huge difference.i'm in the ""you get what you pay for"" camp on this one..if feels really flimsy, the front of it can pop out easily,and while pics weren't horrible, they simply were not the quality of the 1.4"
4,Does what it says,"The lens was great. Very clear and very nice shallow depth of field. My only complaint has nothing to do with the lens but the camera itself. I was hoping this lens would be a good all around lens. But since my slr has a 1.6 magnification (canon xti), i find myself backing up A LOT with this lens because my subject is just too close. By the time I get far back to get my whole subject (i.e. a person from head to toe) in frame, i feel disconnected from the subject. I'm so far away and anyone could easy cut in front of my without knowing... I'll still keep the lens but I wished I got a different one as my first lens (besides the kit)."
5,Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens,This is a wonderful bargain lens. You can't go wrong with this one. It is plastic but the glass is superb! I love it and use it a lot. I is great for low light.
3,Pretty Poopy,"Everyone told us this lens is great for clear close-ups..Not the Case, The casing is plastic.... makes it feel pretty cheap.I would rather invest in something a litle more expensive."
1,Dont believe the hype,"For some odd reason everyone thinks you ""must"" own this lens simply because it is so inexpensive compared to other lenses. I tried it, and was not happy at all. Indoors, it never seemed to want to auto-focus. And switching to manual is no fun because the manual focus ring is too small and seems almost flimsy/sloppy to use. The image quality was mediocre, at best. I found that I rarely used this lens for much of anything. I only used it a handful of times to play with to see what it could do, but never found it to be a must-have lens. Sure the bokeh of an f1.8 is neat, but spend an extra couple hundred on a better quality 50mm if you must have one."
5,Horrible Shipping!,"The product itself is great, but I ordered one day shipping and it took 5 days, if you REALLY want this item, you probably need to order from someone else!"
