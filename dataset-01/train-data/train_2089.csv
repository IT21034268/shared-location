4,business and economics in one plus interesting case studies,"We used this book as bases for our strategic management course and it was really helpful. It explains all the essential things in economics without neglecting the view from the company. It introduces complicated ideas expressed in academic articles in such a way that every undergraduate student will be able to get the message. Even the maths are explained without making you confused. I especially liked the case studies which are worthwhile reading even if they don't belong to the topic discussed in class. The book is well structured and has summaries of the chapters as well as a comprehensive index. Even though it seems quite expensive, it probably is an investment into the future."
3,"If it was an option, I wouldn't have bought it!","If it was an option, I wouldn't have bought it!The book is dense in content about strategy and economics, but I found it a little bit complicated and dry with no concerete numerical exercises. Usually, strategy and economics readings are much more engaging and mind-provoking.I had to buy it for my Business Processes course at business school (full time MBA program)."
3,Maybe,Slow Delivery. But fairly fast to respond to email. Your book will arrive slightly dinged up but you'll receive what you ordered.
1,Pretty pictures are not the whole story,"While the format and outlay of this little book is very appealing, the editors did not review the actual knitting directions for consistency and clarity--for example where squares were of 18 rows, they are suddenly changed to 10 ridges. In other cases, the sequence of steps was very unclear and poorly stated.The multi-colored blankets give very little direction for finishing and thought for how the back of a blanket might look and hold together under fairly strenuous use.For the most part, it's probably a good idea to choose the single colored patterns."
1,Do not buy this book unless you want a lot of frustration,I am an experienced knitter and picked what I thought would be a relatively easy pattern - never have I been so frustrated. The instructions were not explicit enough and I have spent hours trying out my own methods to accomplish what the designer wanted me to do. At this point I really have no desire to even try any more or ever try another Vogue pattern.
2,Advanced Knitters only,"Its been my experience with Vogue that the patterns always tend to be a bit difficult. I had no clue just how difficult this book would be!I thought trying a blanket would be a good starting point but the directions are very confusing. I was so frustrated I had to call a friend who is an expert at knitting and she suggested writing out the instructions. Even she had trouble on the ""Little Lambs, counting sheep"" blanketIn the instructions they take for granted that you will just assume a lot and if you dont I guess you are just out of luck.Be warned this book is very small 7x5 with very small print and the charts even smaller.All in all the pictures or the blankets draw you in but once you start so does the headache."
1,Torn pages,I would not have purchased this book if I have known that their were three torn pages from the book and the cover was dirty. I now have three loose pages that I have to be careful not to loose and I had to clean the book cover before I handled it when I opened the package.
3,baby blankets,"Some of the blankets in here are kind of weird-looking, but there are enough cute ones to make the book worth buying."
3,Start button is too sensitive,"This microwave has a ""add minute"" feature--pressing the Start button while cooking adds a minute to cooking time. Convenient, yes, but the Start button is so sensitive that if I press it just a teensy bit too long, it turns my :30 beverage warm-up into a messy boilover 1:30 later. Don't take your eyes off the display (when you start) to be sure you don't inadvertently add another minute of cooking time."
2,Disappointing fit and finish,"AFter researching all the warming plates, I chose the Broil King NWT-1B. We received this today and although the unit heats correctly, I find the fit and finish to be low quality. The black plastic side handles are cheap looking and the sides were scuffed up making the item look worn. This model is all black yet the screws in the front are bright stainless. Overall my impression is that this is not well thought out and it just like a cheap appliance. I expected better from a company whose customer base is mostly commercial."
1,Lame,"This is supposed to be a DVD where girls strip in public places and hope that they don't get caught. That would be exciting.Instead, in some scenes the girl isn't even outside. Stripping in a closed bar doesn't count as ""nude in public"". In other scenes, they are indeed outside, but usually in a secluded area, and they will even converse with the few people who are there. There's no effort to hide the fact that the girl is naked from the other people. So really, nobody ""Risks it All"", as the DVD promises. The whole thrill of being naked where others can see the girl is therefore lacking.Also, if the girl is nude and facing the camera, the camera doesn't go below her waist. This DVD is supposed to market nudity... so why hide her lower half if she's just standing there? That's awfully tame for someone who's supposed to be doing something risky, don't you think?Skip it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,This DVD is like a G-rated version. Sorry I ever bought it. Don't make the same mistake.
3,I enjoyed watching it once,"I think 1 star is a bit unfair, it's not that bad. There are good & bad things that could be said about this DVD.-1) This isn't a very public sort of nudity, no. A woman might flash her boobs at one guy. Or she might wander around completely naked in a public place where there are no people except for the camera team.2) You never get to see full frontal views of the girls. Not even a glimpse. Just a few brief moments of full frontal view would have taken this DVD to a higher level. But no.+1) These are pretty girls.2) You see a lot of T&A;, especially the former.3) The DVD is professionally made with good picture quality.All in all, I kind of enjoyed it. It was worth watching once. But if you like to see this concept taken one step further then check out ""Fabulous Flashers:Caught In The Act/ Naked In America"". It's basically the same thing only with full frontal nudity.But I long for the day when someone will make a real public nudity DVD. Or a real strip poker DVD."
3,Good to watch with partner,"Pastor Mark says it as it is, real. And funny. Some good points on surviving a marriage. But interesting that the show left out the interesting part on sex & marriage."
1,Absolute Crap,Worst excuse for a video I have ever seen. Put disk through shredder when I finished. Gross. Stupid. Waste of time and money. Save $ and just hit yourself in the head with a hammer.
4,"Review of Mark Gungor's ""Tale of Two Brains"" DVD","As a pastoral counselor, and sometime group leader for Young Couple's groups, I wanted to see this DVD. A couple I know recommended it, but I'd never heard of Mark or his work.I took the DVD with me when I visited with some younger friends in their mid to late 30's. We all enjoyed it very much. He is quite funny, & gets a lot of very good, insightful information across to couples, primarily,while they're laughing their heads off! He explains some things that many couples just don't understand are very real dynamics in most marriages, & he is magnificent in sharing the differences between men & women, in ""most everything"". I believe it would be a useful tool for groups, or if a couple wanted to get it for themselves.Usually, should you lend it to someone, you won't get it back right away. That's a good sign. They're sharing it with every one they know !"
2,Disappointing,"After all the hype, I was disappointed when I saw the actual film. He had a few humorous lines, but I did not find his comments on marriage to be especially insightful, and in some cases I felt they were harmful. (IMHO). He also set the value of women back to the caveman era."
5,Great Sampler,"This is a great 1 CD compilation. It has the usual Dino sides you find everywhere, but there are some great songs in addition to them. Of particular interest is ""Relax-Ay-Voo"" a 1955 Capitol duet with LeAnn Renaud. This song is otherwise impossible to find on disc unless you want to buy the entire Bear Box Set. Recommended for new fans wanting a good sampler, and for the aficiionado who has to have everything."
5,Awesome tunes,This album is addictive. I listen to it constantly and it sounds better every time. Ariel is a wonderful songwriter and an even better vocalist. This album is full of insightful lyrics and great guitar playing. I highly recommend checking it out.
5,I can't stop singing and smiling,"I have waited for this album for years and now I am very happy. Ariel could be compared to Jewel or even Sarah Mclachlan. She projects so much passion and feelings thru her songs, you sense you have known her all your life. Go see her any time you can and you will leave with a smile on your face also.!"
1,This is a poor Windows CE reference,"I found very little of value in this book. Code samples are few. Much of the book, such as the sections on ""choosing your development environment"" and ""To C or not to C"" are worthless to serious Windows CE programmers.Pick up another CE book, such as Robert Burdick's ""Essential Windows CE Application Programming."""
1,I wish I could give it less,"This book was such a waste of money... What the back of the book says it will tell you about it only briefly mentions them... There are a lot of better books out there, and this one just happens to be not it."
5,Edge of your seat,There were several moments in this movie that I was so scared I kept getting up and pacing. I have not been this scared in a loooong time. I didn't realize this film would be so good. It sort of had the creepy surreal feel of Hellraiser. I will recommend this to every one I know!
5,Truly excellent filmmaking,"As a small independent film from the Great White North, ""Cube"" delivers genuine antipication and suspense in the tradtion of Hitchcock and Serling. The 'people trapped in a box' genre may get tired, but accolades must be given to the director for utilizing the same '14 x '14 set for the entire film. If you are from Canada, you may recognize some characters from series as ""Due South"" and ""Psi-Factor"". But be forwarned, there are no happy endings, but if you are tired of overblown, big-budget films that riducule one's intellect - then ""Cube"" will assuredly satify."
4,"Good premise and plot, acting and script need work","The major flaws of ""Cube"" are the acting and the script. Most of the actors are, at points, overacting the melodramatic script. Some of the lines are rather trite as well (e.g., ""He's endangering the pack!""). However, the plot to the movie is quite interesting, and the tense atmosphere holds the viewer's interest well. The concept is intriguing with an air of paranoia. If you can overlook the problems, ""Cube"" is a pretty cool movie."
3,No Way Out,"This creative independent movie has an intriguing idea and knows how to develop it in an interesting, tense and unpredictable way. Six strangers suddently wake up in a room and have no idea how they got there. This cube has six doors that lead to other rooms, so they have to figure out a way to escape and put and end to the rising insecurity and madness. Director Vincenzo Natali knows how to create a claustrophobic feel and a gloomy atmosphere, offering some intense moments and good suspense. The acting is uneven, but the idea and its execution are stong enough to make up for it. It ends up being a picture about life and the choices people make when they face obstacles and turning points. Interesting cult movie."
3,Low Budget Thriller,"Three stars is a strong rating for a low budget, creative ""art"" film. I will not repeat the plot which is ably described in other reviews. The film has a clever but fantastic premise, which places people into the mazelike cube for no reason. The acting and situations create significant tension and conflict. Unfortunately, the effects are more technique than substance The personalities are more like examples of good weekly TV (old Twilight Zone or Alfred Hitchcock Show)shows than a carefully crafted film. Enjoyable but forgetable."
2,Wait til your hammered.,"The first time we watched this movie was several years ago when my wife and I were dating. We were really hammered the night we watched it, and thought it was great. We decided to buy the movie, and watched it for the second time (in years) sober. What a difference a high blood alcohol content can make. The acting is mediocre at best. And while the story is original, it seems a bit contrived and paranoid at times. The special effects are well thought out, but a bit cheaply done."
2,Cool premise but-Junk.,"Cube was dissapointing. Great idea, poor execution. It started out intriguing but fizzled swiftly due to bad acting, bad direction, and horrible pacing. Too bad, the trailer was pretty spiffy."
1,Oh dear.,"Hard to believe this movie has a 4 of 5 star rating here.If you like seeing people killed in interesting ways, then this might be for you. Beyond that, there really isn't much of a reason to sit through this film.It's a common story rehashed in a new setting with poor acting.I consider watching this movie a waste of time. Instead, if you like watching people die in horrific ways, try Ichi the Killer."
1,"Please Don't Become a Victim of ""Cube""","This is my first time ever writing an Amazon Review. I felt obligated to inform all my fellow movie-lovers out there about this movie, which I view as a complete waste of precious film. Please don't waste your time on this movie! The acting in this low low low budget film was just beyond awful and the story line will make you want to use this DVD as a coaster. I can't believe that 2 hours of my life was wasted on watching such crap! SO SAD! Please don't become a poor victim of ""Cube"" like me."
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen,"This was the worst movie ever. You couldn't pay me to watch it again. It was like one of the movies that someone is watching when you go to their house and its half way through it, but you have no choice but to watch it so you try and figure out what is going on. Then you leave and don't see the end of the movie. That is what this is like, except i saw it from the beginning and i saw the end."
1,Why bother! Worst ever!,"If you found the film, on the very least interesting after viewing it and even bother recommending this film to other film buffs, you may need professional help.It is the worst American film I saw. Peewee Herman's film with the pig as the pet was at least funny.The director made a big mistake and should re-think his career path."
2,I live in a cube,"I find this movie to be insulting to those of us that live in cubes. My home is not a trap and the rooms around it do not contain potential death devices. If you like that sort of thing along with feeling frusterated, bored, and annoyed then this movie could be good for you. I recommend it if you like sci fi, and if you like to feel like you're trapped."
3,Interesting but Flawed,"Cube has one of the most unique ideas i've seen for a sci-fi movie, and the bold freshness of that keeps its head above water in some of the slower areas and bad acting parts. Six people awaken in nothing more than a ""Cube"" room with seemingly endless paths and traps awaiting them, a very interesting concept holds Cube together as glue when the story gets out of control I would've also liked it if they had given a reason to where and why these people were in the Cube."
2,"You do the work, since the writers haven't bothered.","You're in a deadly maze and you have a limited amount of time to get out - compelling enough. To make things worse you're trapped with a group of incompetent actors asked to play inconsistent and unmotivated characters, and you are forced to listen to dialogue that makes little sense and has dreadful philosophical pretensions. Just beyond the confines of the set lurk young and goofy directors and writers who are just overjoyed to be making a film (any film) that looks 'cool', that has a 'cool' idea at its core, and who believe in 'very little direction' and 'just getting it in the can' (quotes from their commentary). What do you do in a situation like this? Well, either watch something else, or enjoy the look of the sets, or get excited by the suggestiveness of the situation - come to this movie with low expectations and you won't be too disappointed."
4,Cube,"I really loved this movie. Definitly thought about it for a few days after. Don't think I would own it just because it kind of a ""one trick pony."" I really liked the fact that they didn't all fall in line like most formula movies. I think it represents how most people would act together in such a situation and not how most movies would like us to act. The cube didn't kill them, the power strugle did. See it and you will have to make someone else see just to have someone to talk to."
1,Avoid at all costs,"A really horrible effort. Wooden acting, bare effects and a plot that goes nowhere. Perhaps those that find it profound are just looking at a Rorscharch pattern; there's really nothing there so people read things into it. Rather than watch this movie, read the phonebook: it will be more entertaining."
1,Did you people see the same movie I did?,"This film is essentially a high school geometry test, only with blood - and not in a good way."
1,bad,"that was really bad.really really bad.that movie is not deap.its just not.all the 'questions' they ask are not really important.Go watch Requiem for a Dream or even Pi. Those movies will scare you. THey have more 'suspense.' Wow, that was a bad movie."
1,Possibly the worst film I have ever seen,"If you're looking for entertainment, give this film a miss. There's no story, no romance, and none of the characters are people you would like to know.If you're looking for intellectual stimulation, what little of it there is in this film is in the first five minutes. Some people are trapped in a maze containing booby traps. Since they're mostly unpleasant people, they quarrel and yell at each other. This goes on for an hour and a half. There's some violence and some gore.I regret the waste of the hour and a half I spent watching this rubbish."
1,This film moved me to write a review,"This movie had a long list of qualities that ultimately led to its suckiness.1 Bad plot- the plot was underdeveloped, aiming at the philosophical but asking questions that did not transcend beyond the crappy cube. The only enjoyable part about the plot was the mathematical relationships, but most people dont understand math that well, i'm not sure the writers knew what they were saying (although it was all correct.)2. Bad acting- theres a reason why i never saw these people before and will never see them again. If acting is any of their full time jobs, you tax dollars are currently paying for their public assistance checks3 bad direction- although comedy and tragedy are film basics, this director must have failed both. His horrible failure at tragedy wasn't even comical, just painful.so to continue with the movie's math theme point 1 + point 2 + point 3 = cinema garbageThis film was lucky it got the obligatory star."
1,Useless movie,"I tell everyone I know not to waste their time with this movie. The acting is terrible, the characters boring stereotypes, and the plot trite and insipid. Supposedly there is a deeper meaning to it all, a laughable (and feeble) attempt to find meaninglessness in our actions and existence. People are pulled from their beds and into a box, where one wrong move will kill and staying where you are is the best way to stay alive. The characters each have something to offer in puzzling their way out, math skills, strength, etc. but it all blows up when they get sick of being around each other and start developing silly personality tics."
2,The Cube,I'd rate the movie as fair to good. It had a few little twists but it was kind of drawn out and the acting was a little cheesy. It's entertaining but it's not something I would watch more than once...
4,"Take care, dvd is not an All Region dvd as stated.","I purchased this dvd because i really like this film. It wasn't available in the shops near me at the time and Amazon.co.uk didn't have a new one in stock. I bought this one because the item description stated that it was an all regions dvd.So you can imagine my disappointment when the item finally arrived and i put it in my dvd player to find it is the wrong region. The dvd is obviously a region 1, not a all regions as stated. I now have to send it back because my dvd player will only play region 2/region free dvds.Please can someone update this webpage before someone else is gets disappointed like me!!"
4,this movie is good,"This movie is very good. this is the kind of movie that will leave you thinking, ""i never thought he wound be the one"" (wait til the end). i think that the end of the movie has a special meaning, i think that the moral is, ""dont be fooled by what your eyes tell you, sometimes the people you think would never make it, end up saving your life."" watch it to see what i mean."
3,Great potential but ultimately unsatisfying,"Cube had the capability to be one of the great sci-fi thinkers of the 90's, but about halfway through the movie I got the feeling that the writers came under a deadline. Starting from a tense examination of every room, it quickly moves into a rush of motion. This coupled with an ending that has a feel of ""it was late and I was tired"", makes this movie nothing more than a ""good watch"", but with the potential to be so much more."
3,"Mr. Cronenberg, meet Mr. Serling","What Americans must think of Canadian filmakers! Cube is a curious hybrid of influences: think David Cronenberg's early horror/science fiction films combined with plots culled from The Twilight Zone, particularly ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit."" Viewers are introduced to the film with a startling (and graphic) pre-credit sequence before the film attempts to answer why these men and women are trapped in the Cube (thereby creating further questions). Despite some clever scenes demonstrating the ""lab rat"" conditions imposed upon these ""cubists,"" the film suffers from poor performances (with the exception of Nicole de Boer) and an awkward feeling that the film is really ""stealing"" from masters to tell an uninspired, rehashed story."
4,"Good movie, Good ending","This movie was great. It's definately making strong comments about society. I thought the actors did pretty well also. The ending was great, but it did leave a lot of questions unanswered. But, that's the point of the movie. You don't need them to be answered. Overall, you should at least rent it."
4,"Loved it, but all my friends hated it","To be certain, this movie is not everyone's cup of tea, however I enjoyed it enough to buy it. It is at its heart a very well-written character study, with a bit of a sci-fi/1984 twist to it. The characters all awake to find themselves inexplicably trapped in a mysterious cube-shaped prison, and the interractions among them as the situation becomes more and more desperate are fascinating. This movie never did garner much attention, but it was one of Robert Ebert's video picks of the week, and it is well worth seeing."
4,ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS,"Highlights: Good usage of limited space; building tension; effectively disturbingLowpoints: Acting falters at times; several unintentionally funny momentsConclusion: Several people of different age and sex find themselves trapped within a cube. It consists of endless cubic rooms, some of which are lethal. Goal: find the way out before going completely nuts and killing each other. Is there a way out? Is this hell? Or some government project, designed for...what?The idea is certainly compelling, and the director manages to pull it off well. The camerawork is intriguing, never distracting, yet varied enough to sustain interest during dialogue scenes. The suspence keeps building up, and the film does get under your skin. If only the acting wasn't so borderline-cheesy, this could have been one of the most fascinating visualized ideas of the year."
3,"Good, not great...","When I bought this, I thought I was buying another movie (kind of Matrixish with a woman psychologist going into a comatose man's mind via computer). So, I was surprised and wasn't expecting the movie I saw.I enjoyed the movie. The idea behind it was quite interesting. I did have a problem with the way the cop pretty much collapsed mentally (too abrubt for my taste). The rest of the acting was ok for a low budget flick. I liked the sets and didn't mind the ending that much.All-in-all not a bad flick for $10 or so."
2,We still don't know why,"This movie is okay if you have a little time to kill, but there are a lot of loose ends that are never tied up. This movie has been compared to both Saw and Seven. This movie doesn't even deserve to be in the same sentence with Seven and at least with Saw we learn who the bad guy is and we have a reason for why the main charatcers are subjected to torture. With Cube, we don't know whether these people deserve what they got or not. I think not because the retarded character probably couldn't have knowingly done anything wrong. Except for those two MAJOR flaws Cube is okay for what it is."
2,Don't expect any kind of explanation!,"It is as if the producers started with a truly excellent concept, but were too lazy to develop it any further and just threw together some hackneyed script and rushed off to the set. ""It's just a movie"" is no excuse for the unbelievable effect this unfortunate and inexplicable predicament has on the characters. A reaction of wild panic I could believe, but how the characters behave in this film is simply not plausible. The ending is not in the least bit satisfying. The fact that nothing is explained doesn't lend the film ""mystique"" as I am sure was the filmmaker's intent, it's just very annoying."
1,Skip It,"Cube is the tale of a group of people who awake to find themselves in a square room (a cube!) and with no idea how they got there. The rest of the film is spent trying to figure out how they got there and how to get out, as they make their way from one cube room to another.Sounds boring, right? It is. Cube is an okay film at best, but that is only if you try to derive deeper meaning from it. I tried, I found a nugget, but I still really wasn't all that entertained.The main failing of the film is that we really don't like any of the characters. I know, sometimes this is done to make an artistic statement, well, it had better be done really well then, because any slip up with unlikable characters produces an unlikable movie.I have to give Cube credit, it is a low-budget film, and the actors do for the most part turn in nice performances. My big problem, however, was that I just didn't care by the time it was over."
3,A Brilliant Disappointment.,"This film isn't a total waste of money (ahem, rental) hence the 3-stars. I, however, found it to be very disappointing toward the end. The good news... The set design was truly inspired, and no doubt cost efficient, and the initial character development was delightful. Now the bad news... The paper thin and ultimately unresolved plot. I enjoyed the set, effects and characters for the first 45-50 minutes but then something goes terribly wrong. What began as an alluring sci-fi/thriller degrades into a hack drama-fest that crumbles straight onto what has to be the worst ending to a film since Highlander 2. Rent it for the eye-candy, return it for the early-return bonus. (Bonus not available in all areas.)"
3,Had me looking for a way out too! (of this movie),"Interesting concept - though it was stolen from Twilight Zone episode ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"". Once you start watching you want to see what will eventually happen..it does draw you in. But - to get there - you have to suffer thru some excrutiating acting. I found when the credits rolled I had actually been wincing - I guess thru the whole film. The only saving grace is the nerd from Stargate:Atlantis. He's always good tho he did look like he was only picking up a paycheck (now understand how bad the other actors were?)And the chick from Deep Space Nine, she has the range of a potted plant. Not to mention she looks like a 10 year old boy.Just a good SciFi(not SyFy) Channel movie. That's it."
3,Take It For What It's Worth,"This film has been analyzed and psychoanalyzed. It defies what most of us expect from a sci-fi film with high tech special effects and gadgetry. However, critics and reviewers should leave it as it is...It's a suspenseful sci-fi thriller with no answers.Period.It's a piece of sci-fi cinema, that if you think about it, let's the viewer participate by guessing and analyzing just as much as the characters trapped in the enigmatic cube... So-so acting and not much else to ponder other than all the questions viewers have been left with...you will either love the film or hate it...Maybe both...Find all the symbolisms you want or just be brain-numbed by the experience of watching Cube !"
3,Good but bad acting is very distracting,"I wanted to really like this movie. I thought the idea was a good one. But the acting was absolutely hideous. It distracted me to a point where I was about to actually stop watching the movie. I also thought that the cop character was a little unbelievable...Anyways, the idea was good, the acting [was not]."
4,CUBE mostly great throughout,"This was a great time. The film jumps right into the story and never lets up. The idea is very fresh and innovative and the complexities of the ""cube"" were handled first-rate. The only thing that got to me-and not too terribly much, I might add-was the over-the-top acting of one of the cast members. I don't want to name names, but a for most of the film his eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of his head. Over all, this is a pretty great first film for Natali and everyone involved should be proud of the outcome. Cheers for indie sci-fi."
2,Not nearly as good as I'd heard...,"'Cube', although interesting in some aspects, was more of a disappointment than anything. After hearing of such rave reviews and critical acclaims I was left only to wonder why the movie got such a positive response. As a few reviewers had claimed, 'Cube' was ""one of the most intensely complex movies of the year"". This I found hard to grasp. The set was hardly complex and even less than appealing, the cast was a group of little-known actors where one could see why they were still unknown, and the plot, although intriguing at times, fell short of a ""good story"". Not to mention, after the first half-hour's worth of the movie, the plot became far too predictable, incorporating aspects of cinematography that have been done to death over the past twenty years. Although 'Cube' did come through with its short quips once and a while, it was, in my opinion, a waste of a good $$$..."
4,Great little film,"This is quite a film for such a low budget -- yeah, I know everyone says that, but...well, it is. I could have done without Holloway's character due to SEVERE over-acting, and yes, Quentin had the same problem (not to the same degree IMO). Still, it's better than the FX driven drivel that is coming out of Hollow-wood. I was very upset that the girl didn't make it (wasn't it she that got them where they were?), but I liked the fact that the movie brought out these emotions in me. For kicks, let your Grandma watch the opening scene. (ummm...I sure won't)."
3,Could have been better,"For starters one of the other reviewers suggested that we wouldn't want to be stranded on an island with any of these people. Gee, I don't know. Nicole deBoer is kind of cute. While there are many suspensful moments (anyone want to go through the 'silent' room again?) better explanations are needed for the character's motivations, i.e. the cop. The convict/escape artist departed the premises much too quickly and, yes, the math did not lend itself well to the intelligensia watching the film as we couldn't quite figure out how the whole thing operated. That's too bad. And, of course, the only one to get out is ""you-know-who."" Of course one is waiting for an explanation of the whole thing which the audience deserved. However, I did like it. It was suspensful and I recommend it."
5,Wonderful,This movie was one of the most tense movies I have ever seen. I loved the fact that the questions weren't answered. The whole point was that there was no point. And what Worth said was outside the Cube was great and so true (you're going to have see the movie to find out what it is). This movie was wonderfully disturbing. One of few science fiction movies to have some thought behind them.
4,Original but no eye for detail,"Very original movie, but there's a lack of detail. A lot of questions remain unanswered, where they should be answered. For instance, why are the people in the CUBE and who put them there? To be short: Cool effects, medium acting, great setting, not so well thought over."
2,"Good start, then falls flat...","This movie didn't know what it wanted to do. It starts as a sci-fi/horror and ends up a jumble of lame characters and stupid dialogue. The plot is weak and the vague description of the cubes purpose is laughable. All of the characters undergo a complete personality change in the short time span the movie takes place, and the ending seemed like the writers had stopped caring about what they were doing and just put in the easiest cop-out they could think of. Thumbs down."
3,Great premise - needs work in execution,"A true minimalist execution of a horror film. The ideal low budget film-it only really needs the one set! I must admit the idea alone creates a very creepy atmosphere. However, the script needed more polishing in its dialogue, and the acting belies its low-budget cost."
4,Great Film.,"This is one worthy of owning! It's an interesting movie with an exciting plot. It's hard to believe how low the budget was for this movie and that the whole thing was filmed on only one set! Some of the acting isn't the best, but still manages to overcome that and reveal a real good movie underneath. It is simply a quality indie flick."
5,Intriguing...,"Cast aside all of your preconcieved notions about what 'good' cinema is and just enjoy the ride. ""Cube"" is a wholly original, enthralling piece of work that takes conventional movie themes, whips them around like a lariat and unveils an entirely new way of thinking. Many viewers have been so conditioned by the machine that Hollywood has become that anything new, innovative or unusual frightens them. But you shouldn't be afraid, to think outside the box (pun intended) ""Cube"" is a terrific little film that will tickle your brain, entertain and alter the way you look at life and the people around you. Just a final thought, if Quentin hadn't died, wouldn't have been awesome to see him spun-off in a film of his own? He was the MAN!"
4,Fantastic,"While the characters at first seem stereotyped and boring, the audience quickly sees the pattern of dynamicism. It keeps you interested, and is acted quite well. Though obviously not a high-budget movie, it's far better than many that are. Would recommend to anyone who likes thrillers."
4,Team work,"This movie is definately one to check out. It shows how certain situations with certain types of characteristics of the human can change an outcome. Not knowing the outcome, this movie keeps you intrigued to the very end."
4,Worth watching,"I saw part of this fascinating film quite a while ago and was quite intrigued by what I saw. I've seen the whole thing now, and I'm glad I have as its been worth the wait.Some strangers, who don't know how they got there, wake up inside the cube and try to escape from it - essentially thats it. However each of the occupants has a particular skill that will assist the group as a whole from escaping. The Cube is in fact a series of interlocking cubes - sort of like a giant rubics cube. Some of the inner cubes are booby- trapped making life a little more difficult for the people stuck inside.The movie was probably made on a pretty low budget, but the special effects are still pretty good. When you see the end of the film it doesn't feel like a Hollywood ending, so I wasn't that surprised to find that it is a Canadian film.Watch with an open mind, and don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy a clever little film."
3,"if the acting were better,id give this 4 stars","when i tell people this is where saw got its ideas from,they call me crazy.think about it.....strangers trapped somewhere,not knowing how,why,when or each other.every path to freedom is laced with traps.premiss;a group of strangers awake in a room with no doors or windows and no recollection of getting there.one might equate this as a rat maze in reverse.slowly the group learns more about each other and thus,learning key ways of escaping their predicament.huge problem,the slightest mistake and they die....horribly.as the group dies off one by one,the remaining rats find out not only whos somehow responsible but that their time is running out.this bit of info makes not only the cube their enemy,but each other.anyway,this is a very good movie that unfortunately reaped a couple of horrible sequels.i can see michael bey redoing this soon."
5,psych drama keeps you thinking long after tv is off,"The thing that really got me about this movie (besides the ending) was that the person who seems the strongest ends up being the weakest. It is so enthralling to watch this character slowly lose it. I also thought, as I saw it, that while each character may have had a talent or knowledge or ability to help them get out, they each also seemed to have a deep, hidden flaw that ultimately dooms them. Best human psychology film of 1998-99 year!"
5,XD,"I LOVE this film, and was really happy to find it for such a good price! I purchased this as a holiday gift and was pleased to find that it came right on time and in awesome condition."
4,Slice and dice,"Shocking, disturbing, gripping. These are just some words that can be used to describe this amazing piece of work. It is great to see a movie of this genre where all the effects are up front (and therefore out of the way) leaving loads of space and time for character and plot development. It reminded me of Pi and Dark City in so far as you can draw parallels with our present world (the box says fear, paranoia, suspicion and desperation) and you are left to draw your own conclusions rather than having someone tell you the meaning. Great idea and convincingly acted. If you want to see an interesting film that will have you talking about it for weeks afterwards, watch this."
2,Good idea...bad movie,"Some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie. I'm astounded by how many people give this high ratings. I hesitated even giving it 2 stars. Yes, it's an interesting premise for a movie, and an interesting set, but that's about it. The characters were weak, the acting was worse than weak, the plot was weak, nothing is resolved or explained in the end (a weak attempt by the writer and director to appear purposely ambiguous is my guess). This could have been a good movie if it had been developed properly. Don't waste your time buying this one. Instead wait for it to show up on the Sci-Fi channel. If you want a good movie get Pi."
2,Way too much acting.,"This movie is OK; just OK. It has an interesting premise and a certain level of suspense, but way too much acting and a little too much writing. The ending is a big disappointment.This is one of those movies that nobody could think of an ending for, so they just ended it. Film school stuff, by sophomores for sophomores."
3,Wonderful idea,"The plot has a group of people who are trapped in a cube with no idea of how they got there or why they were chosen to be in the cube. They know they need to escape, but how they escape is the big question. The cube has thousands of rooms, with most of the rooms being boobytrapped. Pick the wrong room and well, that's the end for you. This movie is an ingenious movie as it uses mathematical strategies in order for the characters to survive. The terror in the movie is felt in the idea of being trapped and knowing the choices you make can kill you. There are some good tense moments in this flick. Definately rent this one as it is an original movie."
5,Afterimages,"I can only add this to the reviews: This is the sort of movie that causes images to bubble up in your mind and dreams for days afterwards. Perhaps it's the fact that the entire movie takes place in the same setting, or perhaps it's that perfect buzzing ratcheting *snik* as the hatchways are opened between adjoining cubes, but in any case, this movie definitely leaves an impression. The opening sequence sets the theme..."
2,The best kind of humor..unintentional.,"There was nothing humorous in Cube's premise, in fact, my impression was that the movie would be a great suspense/horror flick. The five characters find themselves stripped of everything but their names trapped in a maze, where each room they entered could potentially hold a new way to die. Here's the problem, the characters talked through would be suspenseful moments. If the film been better written and better directed, true the humor would have been lost, but the film might have actually been good. The only redeeming quality this movie posessed was the level of melodrama on the part of the actors. Three months after seeing this film, I am still able to quote some of the particularly choice moments. See this film because it is entertaining. Expect it to live up to the standards of it's premise, and you will be disappointed."
3,please read,this movie started out really good and it kept you interested through the whole movie. But why did they make the cop turn into a bad guy towards the end of the movie it didnt really make since. The ending is really confusing and a total screw job. is the retarded guy actually out of the cube or was it just a whole other room that was bright. I also didnt like the way they made eveyone except for one person die. I would not buy this movie but renting it isnt all that bad of an idea. the movie does keep you on the edge of your seat.
1,Can't Believe I Watched The Whole Thing!,"The blurb on the box looked interesting enough. The premise was fascinating. The plot was familiar-sounding, but intriguing (teamwork required to glean participants skills to escape this ""maze"" within the cube). The movie was interesting for about 10 minutes. I kept hoping something different would evolve. It left me a bit panicky that people would actually sacrifice their lives rather than cooperate and that tempers would really flare to that degree, but I'm skeptical mankind is in reality this idiotic. Do not waste your time and money on this video."
1,What's all the Hype about? This movie bites!,"I can't believe all the hype this movie has gotten. Aside from the fact that its is filmed inside of one room with different lighting, it fails to entertain. Perhaps its the one dimensional characters that we are supposed to mentally deconstruct. The acting was horrible. A fifth grade drama class could have done better."
1,"No story, no plot","This movie has no story and no plot at all. Nice if you like some gruesome scenes, but that's just about it. I would recommend Cube Zero much more (see my review there)."
1,"Good idea, terrible result","The movie is an interesting premise and could have been very intriguing. This is not the case, though, and the reality is fairly unfortunate. The movie is trite, the characters flat and one-dimensional. For a movie that could have contained such interesting characterizations, the actors (or director, or script) fail to give any depth to the characters. It is miserable. There is tension in the film, but it is annoying, not appreciated. The movie is manipulative, and has nothing particularly remarkable to say."
1,VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY BBBBAAAADDDD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie seemed promising when I first started watching it, but it just got worse and worse. But my real concern is that that the collage girl died because without her no one could have found the exit or what seemed like an exit. Also some people think that the disabled guy got out, but I don't think he did, it just didn't seem like he lived. Anyway, for those who read this, take my advice and don't see this movie. But is you're killed with curiosity go head.(You might like it. Who knows? I don't.)"
3,Interesting idea let down by abysmal acting,"It bothers me that so many mainstream films these days are remakes, but I really hope that someone decides to redo Cube sometime soon. The basic concept is very interesting, the plot unfolds at a reasonable pace (i.e. not getting bogged down in how the characters got there in the first place, but not progressing too fast to lose the suspense), the camerawork does justice to the claustrophobic setting - but the acting was just AWFUL!In spite of this, the film is well worth seeing once, ideally with many other people - you'll be sure to get some very different interpretations as to what it was all about."
3,Take it or leave it,"I like his other books better. This one is entertaining to read, but I haven't gotten a lot out of it. Quick and easy read though, so if you want to try it, it won't take up a lot of your time."
4,"Not bad, but...","As a huge fan of Tristania, and inumerable other gothic metal bands, I must admit that I bought this album with high expectations. Admitedly, it is very good by most standards, but is also far more *shudder* 'pop-friendly' than will generally be apreciated by the average metal-head.Therefore, for those seeking something heavier, I certainly recommend some of Sirenia's earlier works, as well as those of Tristania- masterpeices all.But you should by no means overlook 'Nine Destinies and a Downfall', as it's still a very good record compared to most of the dribble out there these days."
5,"Yuck at first, but was wrong","At first this album really left a bad taste in my mouth. It sounded like all the other generic female fronted bands out there. After putting it aside for a little while in disgust of what it did to my ears and tummy I started hearing songs in my head at work one night. I could not figure out what these songs were and why i knew them so well in my brain. So i went home and dug through my collection and low and behold it was the album i thought was complete poopy by one of my all time favorite songwritters. Now I kick myself every time I listen to it for not enjoying it those many months it collected dust. i usually dont like my metal this poppy. Morten and company put out their most beautiful, melodic, catchy, and all around fantastic album with this one."
2,What happened Morten?,"Sirenia is the only band who has never produced a song I didn't like--until now. I bought this new release expecting to love it all, with one or two epics like Euphoria, Sister Nightfall, or Lithium and a Lover. What did I get instead?--46 minutes of pop radio. Gone is the violin, and rare is Morten's voice. We get a bunch of Monika (who has a solid voice, but every song sounded the same). Please, Morten, tell us this is an early April fool's joke and that the real release is coming out April 2."
4,Epic...,"Epic vocals from one of the best lead singers to be with Sirenia. Love the sound of this album, for those who don't like a lot of screaming this is a great album."
3,Vanilla Metal,"Sirenia's new album had a lot of hype surrounding it that got me interested; a few test tracks and I was sold. I got the album itself for Christmas, and was very disappointed. Each track follows functionally the same construction as every other, with a few exceptions. The production values are high, but the lyrics are cheesy and, at times, banal. Their new singer has the chops, but their songwriting needs work."
4,missing that special something...,"morten veland & co. could do much much better:( to be sure,it ain't a bad piece of work. i can think of plenty of other so called artists with much worse offerings but compared to their previous releases like ""an elixir for existence"" or the superb ""at sixes and sevens"" , this album sounds too radio friendly or ""safe"" for my liking. newcomers or those looking for something mainstream sounding like evanescence might fall in love with this but for those who are accustomed to sirenia's earlier works or tristania during morten veland's era, ND&D; may disapoint you...3.5 out of 5 stars"
3,Up there with the rest,"A really fine album, is up there with the rest of the new Scandinavian metal bands, proving that over the last few years Northern Europe IS the new driving force that rejuvenated the whole metal scene.OK... they are not Nightwish, and there are some other similar bands that I prefer more (Tristania, Leave's Eyes, Therion). But the whole album is good and there are 2-3 tracks that stand out. And ""My Mind's Eye"" truly is a ""hitter""!"
2,Blase,"I wasn't impressed. The lead singer's voice is not as rich as I expected, and I read somewhere that this band considered themselves to be ""symphonic"" metal, and even went so far as to invite comparisons with Dimmu Borgir. Yet I heard very few strings or winds, and I heard none of the bombast associated with Dimmu's latest offerings (Death Cult Armageddon & In Sorte Diaboli).The songs are amateurish with bland, predictable melodies that lack energy and lyrical content that sounds like it came directly out of my buddy's goth sister's diary.In short, mopey 14-year-old self-mutilators who just lost their ""one true love"" will eat this up. The rest of us have better things to do."
2,Not the Sirenia we used to know..........,"I loved the first two Sirenia albums for their diversity. Screams, growls, whispers, clean vocals, female vocals, choirs, you name it - it was there.Now the songs are less complex, more repetitious, and (gasp) ""radio-friendly"" with pop-style female vocals and Morten's vocals appearing on only three songs.Ouch! Not exactly what we long-time fans were expecting!! If the goal was to become a more accessible, female fronted band...then I suppose Morten succeeded. However this is not going to thrill everyone who has been listening since Tristania. Speaking of them, Illumination was surprisingly more creative than this album.I hope Sirenia goes back to its old, diverse and exciting ways. The first two albums were in my stereo for a consistent six months or longer. I haven't even been able to listen to this one even six times. A ""Downfall"" for now...but perhaps if enough of us speak out, we'll get a stronger fourth album. (fingers crossed)"
2,When good dogs do bad things,"Check out the My Minds Eye video on YouTube... I was hoping it wasn't a representative of the album, but alas, it is.Compared to older stuff (At Sixes and Sevens - 5 stars) I'm giving this 2 stars and not 1 only because the instrumental parts are still well written (fret not for it is still far above and beyond Lacuna Coil), but whatsherface's pop vocals make it pretty much unlistenable for any older Morten Veland fans. His vocals only make an appearance on 3 tracks, and even then very briefly.Let's hope that some day they'll re-release this album with vocal tracks completely rearranged and rerecorded."
2,not exactly what I had expected.,This is not exactly what I expected. Now I have always liked Monica Pederson's voice. I was very familiar with her previous group Sinphoniawho recorded two albums 'When the Tide Breaks' and 'The Divine Disharmony' both of which I own but her voice does not fit the music.She would be a lot better fronting a more progressive or folk oriented rock band then a metal oriented band trying to sound more pop. Well maybe next time.
1,Didnt work for me =0(,"I was hoping that it would...as I have wicked cramps monthly...but every woman is different, and I do use a holistic approach on most things (and yes that approach works...ive been PMS free due to taking 500-800 mg of magnesium daily!) but in this case?..I was grabbing for a large dose of ibuprofen..."
5,LA PELICULA MAS IMPORTANTE HECHA EN MEXICO,"Finalmente esta obra maestra de Fernando de Fuentes esta disponible en DVD. Considerada como la pelicula mas importante que haya producido Mexico segun la revista Somos, Vamonos con Pancho Villa nos cuenta las aventuras de seis hombres de la provincia mexicana que deciden dejar sus casas para unirse al ejercito de Pancho Villa. Juntos encuentran la crudeza y realidades de una guerra civil. Uno a uno va pereciendo con mas pena que gloria, hasta que el ultimo de ellos ya totalmente desilusionado de la lucha y sus circunstancias decide regresar a casa.Hay algunas deficiencias en el sonido de esta produccion, pero poder disfrutar un clasico de esta magnitud finalmente en DVD lo justifica totalmente.Ojala y Cinemateca obtenga el exito que merece con estos trabajos y siga dandonos la oportunidad de disfrutar de este tipo de peliculas."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I purchased this product because of the Meguiar's name (which is becoming over-rated) and the expectation that it would somehow be better than a typical generic chamois...I was wrong. First, this chamois is no thicker, is no better quality, and is no better shaped than any average product out there at half the price. Second, when they indicate 3' they mean it...it isn't one square millimeter larger. Third, and what I just can't understand, is that the chamois comes taped together. When I tried to carefully remove the tape, gum residue remained on the chamois. I just returned the first one for replacement (thank you Amazon), but the replacement was even worse. Since the Chamois is so small, I didn't have the luxury of cutting off the gummed part. I ended up using a de-gumming product and then cleaning the chamois...all a waste of my time. My suggestion, pass on this overpriced product, it isn't anything special."
4,Car Detail Fanatic,"10x more efficient then the absorber, however I recommend purchasing the 4' chamois or larger."
4,Better than the more common Shave gels,I've used gillete edge for about 25 years. I've changed razor style numerous times of that time and never the gel. I wish I would have tried this stuff sooner. I felt less pull with a worn blade using this than my usual edge. I liked that it didn't come out of the nozzle as fast as Edge as I'm not moving that fast myself at 6 am. Gave it 4 stars because I'm cheap and wish it was the same price as the more common gels. I'll still use it even though it costs more so that says something.
4,Excellent shaving gel!,"I have been using shaving oil and brushed-on shaving soaps and creams for a long time because they are usually superior to canned foams. However, I started using Neutrogena Razor Defense Gel this week on my dermatologist's recommendation and I have to say that I'm impressed. My face feels like it's coated in Teflon, and the razor slides very smoothly over it. There's no irritation or burning feeling after the shave.BTW, this product doesn't create much foam because it's not supposed to. Foam is mostly air and does nothing for you."
1,"Nice looking fan, but quickly died","Fan looks nice, nice remote features, but quickly died after running fine for a few weeks. No technical support, manual is useless, not much good without remote (can't direct wire and access all features unless you buy more parts), no company web site (who is Casa Vieja?)."
1,Makes noise after 3 weeks= Useless!,"I have had 3 of these fans. They look great, but don't buy it! I sleep with earplugs because of the noise from this fan. And it wasn't a balancing thing.So annoying. Again, do NOT buy this fan unless you are deaf."
2,Dysfunctional Southern Police Procedural,"First Lady fails to develop a cognizant thought or character. The occasional clever line rarely links the reader to the central theme of murder by mutiliation. Police procedural is scattered carelessly throughout the book with prevalent characters appearing seemingly at the authors whim. With the exception of Captain Mangum Malone's central gallery of characters lack resonance or believability. Justin Savile, Malone's lead character, weaves inept investigation, marital infidelity, and his bland southern grit personality into a loose collage of xanax induced lethargy. First Lady slogs quietly in the currents of a sluggish river, rarely touching shore and filled with deluted brackish debris. Save your mystery money for the slew of upcoming books by authors with functional characters and plots worthy of your time."
3,Disappointing and not as great as Time's Witness,"This is Malone's long-awaited sequel to Time's Witness (which was fantastic). Cuddy, Justin and Alice are all back again struggling for justice and equality in the New South.I was disappointed, however, to see that Malone has had Cuddy continue to be in love with Lee Haver (a woman who does not deserve him and who I had hoped Cuddy had dumped forever). The plot itself is good and, as always, Malone's characters carry the day. But while Time's Witness is brilliant, First Lady is simply ordinary."
3,"Okay, maybe 3.5 stars...","Has its moments but overall it is confusing and bland. There is really very little about the South (old or new) here. The plot is thin, complex and preposterous -- willing suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this pushes the boundaries too far. Not a good follow-up to Uncivil Seasons which was a terrific book (I gave it 5 stars) with the same main characters -- what happened?"
4,"great writing, weak solution","As predicted by many reviewers, i found this book to be absorbing -- well written, and the characters intriguing, at least for the most part. maybe i am too old, but I found the ""wild"" rock star to be very unappealing, and while this is not a fault of the author (who may have wanted her to be so?) i wanted scenes in which she starred to end. I didn't like her.A more valid criticism is that the i thought the villain was much too obvious.This is the first of the justin/cuddy books i read, and i jumped right into the earlier ones. I am finding that overall, I like Time's Witness more than First Lady. (and guys, tell me: do any real men pine for a teenage love their entire adult lives? I find it hard to believe)."
4,"A Review of ""Annie's Potty""","I like this little potty book. It didn't work any `potty magic' for us, but then again nothing has - not even the potential reward of a new Thomas engine. (Sigh.)The story begins when mom brings home a potty and is met with crossed arms and a decided, `no thank you'. Mom offers underpants with bunnies as a reward, but it's no-go, and a disappointed mom tells dad that he can go ahead and use the potty as a planter. Papa has things in a little bit more perspective. He laughs and wisely says that Annie is just not ready yet.Indeed, time passes and Annie changes her mind about the potty. After learning about potty etiquette, and that she and mom can survive even an accident, she drops diapers for good.Four Stars. [B-]. Good book about potty training. Like the other reviewer, it is a book that I don't tire of reading. My children like it as well, and one day, like the book reminds me, my little boy will be ready."
2,Bad Movie,Bad Plot and bad acting. Story that's hard to belive. When players on tour say it's a movie that never should have been released you know it's bad.
1,thanks for nothing,I never got it not all i been waiting and waiting for almost 2 months ad still never got it thanks alot
3,MY GRADE: C plus.,"A somewhat cheesy 80s tale about a kid (C. Thomas Howell) who starts his summer in Los Angeles working for his lawyer uncle and then turns to volleyball contesting with a washed out pro (Peter Horton). Supporting roles by Kathy Ireland and Courtney Thorne-Smith though the former is very little and she isn't wearing her usual bikini. There's lots of skin, sun and beach as well as volleyball games especially at the end. Barely entertaining. Eighties music galore and those horrible outfits and hair styles date it.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; DELIVERS ON WHAT IS PROMISES (skin, sun & sand): B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid May 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."
3,"NICE, IF UNREMARKABLE","""Side Out"" is a breezy, if unremarkable film. If you love beach volleyball, you'll love this film. The ""Rocky"" of the sport."
2,Happy crap....,"This is a pretty bad movie, but if you are in the mood for that, watch Side Out. If you have a hangover on a Sunday afternoon, this movie may fit the bill. The dialogue will make you squirm, and then crack up. The movie isn't mean-spirited, just painfully cheesy. Nothing happens in the flick that you wouldn't expect. The best part of the movie is the dialogue. It's priceless!"
3,Funniest Movie (non-intentional),"This movie falls in with so many other failed attempts at a decent movie that has to do with sports. The movie is no where near believable. The worst display of volleyball i have ever seen. The movie really gets funny when they try to act. However, cheezball movies such as these are classics, and should be in everyone's collection."
4,"Side out, now there's a concept.","This is one of the worst films you are ever likely to see. The acting stinks, the action is awful, however, this is strangely compulsive viewing. You know exactly what is going to happen but for some reason you have to watch. This is a must for all useless movie fans. The other big problem is that somebody must have believed that beach volleyball was going to be huge, that never happened. Genius! once more C.Thomas Howell in a real stinker, keep up the good work."
5,Wonderful feel,"This album is fun, fresh and great on rock and roll tunes. The best songs are ""Living on a coast line"" with a regaee feel, ""I love this bar"" and ""One sip"" pop rockers and ""Halfway to Memphis"" with a great country feel. These songs place you right in front of the beach watching the seagulls with a cold drink in your hand. Great stuff."
1,What happened to Sammy!?!,"I love Sammy and have followed him for many years including seeing him in Cabo but this album sucks big time. It is like he is doing a bad Jimmy Buffett impersonation. I have a poster from a concert of Sammys that I attended a couple of years ago and below his picture it reads "" The voice of real rock"" Well this album is REAL bad and not any kind of rock."
1,"Oh man Sammy, dont know where you are or where you're going??","Well you can probably tell by the title of my review I am dissapointed again. Sammy, if you read this or if his fans do, don't get me wrong. I just sense some change in the Red Rocker. It is almost as if he is stretching and reaching and grasping at straws or swatting at flies!! The genuine music of his past with the feelings coming through in his powerful voice are not here in Living It Up. He sounds raspy, hungover and desperate.Sammy dear, if you need money, I suggest not making any more of these far fetched CD's and hooking up with VH again, doing voice overs that will allow the punch and push you lack, and/or hanging up the michrophone and coming to the resolve that the only place you will be singing when you reach 55 or so is in Mexico....Sorry sweetie, words are meant for growth only-What would you do with out a critique?DLP"
5,Sammy goes Buffett!!!!,I was just amaized at how well crafted this CD is..and you know for the first time in his life I think Sammy has done the CD Sammy wanted to do ..and not the CD we expected him to do.For a guy who will be 59 in October Sammy has now learned that he can make good fun and thoughtful music and still be accepted. Ohhh! I would love to see a Sammy and Jimmy Buffett duet on the next CD...Hint! Hint!...Nudge!...Nudge!
1,I thought I knew bad music - then I heard this album.....,"I've been a VH fan for years and years. I've loved Hagar's work with them as well as his solo work. As a matter of fact, I still listen to his self-titled album (aka I Never Said Goodbye) and think it stands the test of time. Let's face it, Sammy was never known as a lyrical giant - but he has hit an all-time low. This album is just plain pathetic! Every tune on it is a blatant advertisement for his resort and/or his tequila. Give me a break! Can't you find something else to sing about??? This album reminds me of Hollywood's take at a Buffet album - and not an early Buffet album but one of his more recent releases. If you're looking for bad lyrics that advertise Sammy Hagar's club and product lines - then this is the album for you!"
3,Sammy's Done Better,"I've been a Hagar fan since his Montrose days. He's done better. I really like that every album is distinct and has a profoundly different sound, a lot like U2. Each album has its standout tunes and it seems that this disk's standout is a cover of a Chesney tune. Sure, it's a great tune, but it's not an original Sammy work. As a longtime Redhead, I regret to say that this album isn't one of Sammy's better works. There's no worry of wearing out this CD the way I've worn out Standing Hampton or even Red Voodoo. This album has two, maybe three good tunes, those being I Love This Bar and One Sip. The rest is passable for die hard fans, but this album is unlikely to win any new ones. I'll stick to Sammy's previous work and his work with VH. This one is most likely going to remain on the shelf most of the time. Sorry, Sammy. Love you like a brother, but you've done better."
1,SAY IT AIN'T SO SAMMY!!!!!,"Sorry....The Red Rocker's gone all softy on us.And country too boot!This albumn is...well...YUCK!I've been a Sammy fan since the days of Montrose, and he's always brought the goods. But this album is for Buffett lovers, NOT ROCKERS!If you plan on continuing down this path Sam, at least change your name to the Red Necker or somethin'.Actually, one star is more than this deserves."
3,Drinkin' music in place of good song writin',"Come on, Sammy. Four covers on one album...in a row. A Toby Keith, a Keith Chesney, a Bob Dylan, and ....One of you're own? ""Halfway to Memphis"" was on the Not 4 Sale album.Sad thing, those are the best songs on the album. Don't get me wrong, ""Sam I Am"", ""Mexico"", and ""Sailin'"" are okay, but it isn't Red Voodoo.I'm a big Sammy fan. I have most all the music he's done since VOA, and quite a bit before that, but I beleive this is a miss.He's had much better hits.Of course, it is Sammy, so I'll continue to listen. It isn't a bad album, but Sammy is better than this."
1,Sam he is and its all good.,"I've always been a fan of both versions of Van Halen. I enjoy them both for their differences and what each lead singer brought to the mix. Solo career wise, you have to just love Hagar. He just knows how to put on a show and evolve. Dave still seem stuck in 1984. Hagar has evolved into a hard rock Jimmy Buffett type. His music and attitude is very similar to Mr. Parrothead: we're here to party and have a good time. There isn't any underlining message to the music, no preaching. Its just fun rock music with a guy who seems to be having fun. The album is just like that and in this day and age its just plain fun to listen to an album, while you're having a couple of Waboritas and not have to worry if the next song is gonna be any good. Its all good. Will it convert people to Hagar. Probably not. Will it appease his fans. Most definately. Will I buy the next album. You can bet your...well you know."
2,I had to buy it to believe it....,"...but it's true. Sammy's gone country. There are 2 MAYBE 3 tracks on this whole album that are any good. My taste in music is very broad with one exception - country. If I had to name one rock icon of mine, it would be Sammy and...Sammy...you really let me down with this album. It pains me to say so, but I can't recommend this album to the classic Hagar rock fan."
1,I am glad I didn't buy it !,"After listening to the songs on the album, and then hearing a song from ""The Pointer Sisters"" -- Let me take you there -- I decided not to buy it. I could not listen to Sammy sing the song, the same one I heard the Pointer Sisters sing in Vegas, years ago. Man, what happen to the old Sammy?"
3,Sammy's Gone Country!,"I was a big Sammy Hagar fan back in the day. I even saw him on the V.O.A. tour where he put on an incredible show, long before Van Halen ever came calling.I picked up Livin' It Up last week hoping to find that Old Sammy that I grew up with but unfortunately, he's not on this release. Sammy's gone country!There are a couple of contemporary country music covers on this disc, as well as a cover of Bob Dylan's Rainy Day Women. The rest of the CD is composed of relaxed tunes that suggest Sammy was on a long vacation when he put this together.All in all, the CD isn't bad and if it were released by another artist, it might be quite good...but if you're looking for ""There's only one way to rock"" ""Heavy Metal"" or even ""Your love is driving me crazy"", you may be disappointed."
3,It is hard to write something bad about Sammy!,"First of all, I am a Redhead that has slept on the street in front of the Cabo Wabo to see Sammy the next night.If you are a true Redhead like me, then you should buy this CD.If you are looking for a Van Halen-like album, then you may be disappointed. Just a hint, Sammy lets his son and wife sing on this album. Why?Also, Sammy sings a Toby Keith song, a modern day version of ""I'll take you there"", and covers Bob Dylan. The CD is not Blue-grass like Diamonique-Dave, but it is more country than rock. ""Sam I Am"" is a catchy tune, but that is the only one that I have enjoyed. But, no regrets.Good luck!"
3,Where is the additional material?,"I purchased this book over a month ago. I expected to receive additional supporting materials which would greatly aid my understanding of the various formulas used throughout the book. The additional supporting material has yet to be posted. As such, currently, i feel i have been overpromised and underdelivered."
5,A Must-Have for any Home Library!,"I bought this book several years ago from a book club. I've read it several times a year since then and each time I read it I can't put it down. Would be a fantastic book for students of any grade/age level, or something to read to the sight-impaired at your local nursing home!"
3,"Pulp...fairly fun pulp, but pulp nonetheless.","Don't get me wrong--I've been keeping up with this series and I intend to keep doing so. But it's Sci Fi Channel Rocketship Avengers fare--the MTV fare of fiction--and meant to be approached as such. I'm reading comparisons to Heinlein in other reviews--well, yeah, but it's the Heinlein of teenage heroes for teenage readers. Shatner's hero Jim is a bit older but is cut from that mold. Shatner tries to bring the feel of these books into adulthood by giving them the noir aspect of his Tek series, but that doesn't make them literature by a country mile. I've been a Shatner fan for decades, but I have to admit that he is narcissistic--and it's that trait that he gives to his heroes: grandiose and ""misunderstood"". Decent light reading, but don't expect more than that. After all, there are only so many Donaldsons and Herberts."
5,Bunnies are a big hit with our shorties,"This book has been a perennial favorite of my nephews and niece for many years. This is not the most literary, hip book that I've given them, but the one that they ask me to read the most. I think the simple story works well with the toddler set, and the bunnies are cuties."
3,nfw,"Disappointed. Illustrations are not as beautiful as the work done in ""So Many Bunnies."" Text doesn't flow...too contrived and the last word of each page's rhyme is on the next page...which makes the reader/listener have to decide whether to linger over the scene or turn the page to finish the rhyme. Modes of transportation are depicted well, but on most pages the bunnies don't have the charm they have in ""So Many Bunnies""...they are pretty much secondary in many of the illustrations, so if you liked ""So Many Bunnies"" for the rabbits, you may be disappointed in this edition. Opening and closing spreads have the charm I was expecting throughout the book."
4,Good summer drive-with -the -top-down music,I really enjoy listening to the music as I cruise around town with the convertable top down... If you like to listen to the Go-Go's during the summer - You'll like this CD....
3,very upbeat and entertaining with catch tunes,"I first heard this cd in french class thanks to my teacher, before long the whole class was begging to hear it. It's a great way to pick up on french pronunciation, not to mention it's just great music!"
4,Enjoyable,"I got this book it was on a list of ""controversial"" personalities from the occult scene, dating back quite a ways. This book was right on, explaining pretty early it's not really about religion. Witchcraft is about getting you what you want, sometimes through the use of seduction and manipulation, and the use of magick to alter reality. I hadn't even kissed a woman quite some. Hexes may work, but be warned it does come at a price. I finally achieved SOME happiness after years of disappointment."
3,Need more information,"Finding good, clean entertainment these days is a hard thing to do, so having 3 boys ages 16 to 12, I was very excited to find this adventure pack from Hallmark. Hallmark has a reputation for clean movies with a positive message so I felt pretty safe getting movies I knew nothing about. I read the reviews, looked at all the information provided and didn't find anything that seemed objectionable. I was very disappointed when I actually got them because there were several of the six movies that were listed as having profanity and violence in them. I expected some violence because they were adventure movies, but not profanity. I haven't actually had a chance to watch the movies, yet, but I wanted to make other conscientious buyers to be informed."
2,Questions Abound,The description only says 6 movies is in this set...but it fails to say what those six movies is...leaving me with questions about it.
2,Panasonic - not up to the task,"I just purchased one of these and have only used it a few times, so keep that in mind. I am comparing it with the Water Pik Cordless. First, I am disappointed that it seems to have a very small tank. It says it is the same size as Water Pik, but only lasts about 30 seconds and has to be refilled several times. With the Water Pik I would have to refill it maybe once. Also, it comes with only one tip, but I don't know how durable it is. One thing I am not happy about is that instructions state you can't use anything but plain tap water. My dentist said to mix it up with part hydrogen peroxide or Crest mouthwash (I have gum issues) but apparently you can't with this one. I can't comment on battery life or durability yet, but don't rate it highly because of these other issues."
3,Oral Irrigator,The irrgator works well and it's practical for out od home situations since it has its own power and water supply. I see drawback in inability to control the power of the jet which affects the water supply. As it's the water lasts perhaps just one minute.
1,Not so great,Not the best. You are definitely better off buying one with a plug. I can't even change the batteries. I would not buy it again.
1,Panasonic Oral Irrigator,Ordered this product for wife.Wife complained it's TOO STRONG (pressure wise). Hurt her gums.She visited our family dentist and took product along for review and was advised not to use it. Dentist agreed the pressure is too strong and advised to get a Water Pik which she did.Problem solved.
4,A good product,"I was a little disappointed when I first opened this irrigator. I had been using a portable WaterPik with a rechargeable battery. I had a lot of trouble with the battery; thus, I decided to change brands. This Panasonic seemed a little less substantial at first; however, I have been using it for over a month now and I like it a lot. I am still on the original batteries so I don't know how long they will last. My only complaint is I am unable to adjust the force of the water flow. I've had periodontal problems for years with sensitive gums; however, my gums have gotten used to the force of the irrigator and it actually feels good. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,fake photos,"Truly stunning photography, but Mr. Bloom's manipulations of his photos go too far. This is not being billed as a photography art book, but as ""untamed"" ""wildlife"". Light hitting animals from different directions, missing footprints and identical snowflakes in separate shots more than indicate that these shots are composites.Leaves me with a feeling of having been cheated."
2,Don't buy this book as a bargain,"I bought this book as a bargain and in the description it said the condition would be knew and the only difference would be that it may be marked as a bargain. However, the condition of the book was really bad and it was so damaged that many pages were lose and the binding was completely broken. I will never buy a bargain book from amazon again, even though the book itself (if it was in good condition) is awesome."
3,It was ok,"Bottom line, this magazine is for people who are up-to-date with big skating names and who are interested in their acheivements. It is full of pictures and interviews. My advice is this- if you trully are interested in the sport and the stars, subscribe. But if you're only interested in how to land your double axel, this magazine won't help too much."
5,"Past, Present, and Future...Insightful","Although raised in sunny Cuba I learned how to skate in that country at age 6 and have been an avid figure skating fan ever since. I had the good fortune of meeting Sonja Henie, in Cuba, as a child when she skated there in 1952.It took me years to locate a magazine on figure skating, but finally located and subscribed to IFS. I have been a subscriber for over ten years.Although it went through a recent change in ownership, it only became better, offering the reader now a section on books, videos and television times which I have found very helpful.The articles are,indeed, international in scope and offer good coverage of current events as well as what has turned out to be very good glimpses of future stars. I read my issues cover to cover and that never changes. The interviews are well documented, and the graphics are beautifully laid out. I hope others can share in my enthusiasm for this fine publication."
5,The Boss,Omg Bruce is gettig as old as I am. Just saw him in a concert for Sandi victums The man and his music is amazing. grant you know what he is sing you can actually hear the words and know what they are. Not to many song or singer can do that today. This is a true superstar with music you willl remember 20 years from now not forget in 20 minutes or at the most 20 days like the music of today.....
1,Not the right CD,"Received this CD with Bruce Springsteen packaging and in a Bruce Springsteen box however the music on the disk is not Bruce, discovered this error too late to return. I own a copy of this album purchased from a record store many years ago, ordered this copy for a friend. Also the CD comes without liner notes; however there is a link to a website where you can download them. Highly recommend this album for someone just getting into Bruce. A hardcore fan will likely already have all these songs and versions. Recommend buying this disk from AMAZONGreatest Hitsnot this eco-friendly packaging from a 3rd party."
1,This guy can't sing.,I am wondering how this guy made any money. He can't sing and his songs just become noise.
3,Great for newcomers to the sheets,"Putting aside some of the self ego stroking by Mr. Ragozin, this book puts many of the sheet theorys into context by the master of speed numbers. Any serious handicapper will find the contents of this book not just helpful but perhaps addictive. The chapter ""Reading Between The Lines"" is particularly illuminating. I thought he could have been a lot clearer on how he desgnated horses condition from A thru D. A more detailed discussion of this practice would have been welcomed by me. On balance though, for someone who has devoted a major portion of his adult life to discovering these many verified concepts, and is willing to share it with those of us still struggling to get an edge in this highly exciting game, I for one tip my hat to an enormously thoughtful gentleman Buy the book, you won""t regret it, besides you'll at least have one winner for the year."
2,What's he selling?,"This book seems to be more of a 200 page ad for Sheets than anything else. There are some entertaining elements and a little handicapping, but overall he seems to be stroking his ego and taking shots at Beyer's methods. The book is more of a commentary on Ragozin's life than insight into his methods."
3,Informative but not Exciting,"I brought this book for a class. While it is very informative, it does not make for an exciting read. The writing style is prosaic and very academic. I actually like Mao's China Before and After better as an alternative."
3,A study of the condition of urban women in Iran,"Neither quite a documentary, nor a fiction, as very often with the iranian cinema, ""Our Times"" depicts the presidential elections in 2002 and focuses on one woman candidate. Why she wanted to be a candidate and what happened. It would be a terrible spoiler to tell more... :-)An interesting story but lacking in strength."
4,West Country Tragedies,"The Sea Garden unburies its dead and lays them at the feet of a late twentieth century American newly betrothed to a man who inherits the Garden by the sea. She curses her fate as history appears in the present and she tunnels back into the past. Betrayal, murder and the cruelty of the sea mixed in the wonderful bouyant Llewellyn style."
1,Worthless,I saw this book at Barnes & Noble and I'm really glad I did before I made the mistake of purchasing. It only tells you how to make skirts with premade patterns and on top of that doesn't even give the pattern numbers.
2,Not very happy,"I was very disappointed with the light fixture. The antlers are very loose on the fixture. And there was no way to tighten. Our contractor tried to add some stability with wires but I was not very happy. We had already taken it out of the box and thrown out the packaging so I had no choice but leave it installed. Also I was not fond of the antler's coloring, it looks un-natural and not like the natural tan in photo. The candles are also not very upright."
1,ok but not the happiest,we got are chanderlier it says they are fake elk antlers. My dad has been a hunter for a number of years we even have are own hunting business out in montana since 1995. the antlers they use to make this chanderlier are not elk they are mule deer. it is a nice chandlier but they are not elk and thats what we where really looking for.
5,Excellent collection of papers,"In a more advanced volume than ""Heuristics and Biases,"" Tverskey et. al. provide another excellent collection of papers that any student/professor/researcher in Behavioral Decision Theory should own."
4,Really helps my dog's allergies,"My yorkie/shih-tzu mix suffers from allergies very badly. Every year around the same time his allergies flair up. He scratches his self to death. I tried benadryl and it didn't help at all. The only things that help are shots from the vet and a prescription med they give him (I can't remember the name). But the meds from the vet get expensive. My vet recommended this, but the only place that I could find it in stores was walgreens, and for frequent use it gets expensive. This is a great deal for the price and it works."
5,Generic Tavist review,"I had prompt service, and paying for the antihistamine I need every day is much less expensive than buying it at a drug store. In fact, I am about to put in for another order! BTW, my doctor told me there is nothing better than Tavist (generic or otherwise) in drying up sinus secretions.That is good enough for me!"
1,It works great!,"This has been a really bad allergy season for my six little terriers. Diphenhydramine (Benydryl generic) stopped helping four of them and they were tortured by itchy haunches to the point of pulling out big chunks of hair. My vet recommended trying Clemastine before getting into steroids. The Clemastine works great--1/2 of a 1.34 mg tab every 12 hours. It is crucial to time the doses close to 12 hours. This seller has been fast and reliable, I'm ordering again today."
3,Works but not 100%,I have used three different types of allergy meds to relieve my dogs itching issues. I tried benadryl which did nothing and Chlorpheniramine which helped but not extremely effective. Clemastine seems to work the best but it definately doesn't completely stop this itching. This product works well enough that we will continue to use it during the cooler months since that seems to be his allergy season. I do recommend trying it on your dog. It may not stop the problem but it reduced it to a more tolerable level.
4,Antihistamine,Clemastine Tablets (Generic Tavist) is a good antihistamine and DH Medical through Amazon provides these at a good price with good service.
5,Wonderful Product,"I had taken a product for years called Tavist,I couldn`t find it anymore in my area.Thank goodness for Amazon.com,this product has the same ingredients as Tavist and really gets my allergies under control.It will make you drowsy,so if you are like me and never get enough sleep,it`s a win win product."
4,Tavist replacement,"Seams to be the same thing as Tavist at a much lower cost. I have noticed it seems to make me drowsy, where as, the Tavist product did not do that."
3,"Good product, ridiculous pricing lately!","I've used this on my dog for several years now. It helps relieve his skin allergies and seems to work fairly well, not great, but he does seem to get some short-term relief when he is on these.I've always been able to buy this on Amazon or eBay for around $13 - $15 for 100 1.34mg tabs. Now all the sudden the price is jacked up everywhere to well over $25 for the same amount, a 100% price increase! I'm currently looking for an alternative to try as I'm not going to pay these ridiculous prices.UPDATE: 9-Feb-2011 - on a whim I decided to stop by my local pharmacy and ask if they could order this for me and if so how much, to my surprise they were able to easily order a 100 count bottle of the 1.34mg strength and charged me only $10! So I would suggest if you're having a hard time finding this product and/or sellers on Amazon and eBay are charging more than $15 or so for this, check with your local pharmacy and see if they can help you out."
5,Great price for generic Tavist,"This generic Tavist costs a fraction of what it costs in a pharmacy. Be sure to choose the product and then decide how many you need. If you choose a deal, better price for two, sometimes they come from different shippers, costing more since they come from 2 places and charge from both! Beware!"
5,Exact item I needed for a great price & quick shipping,Exact item I needed for a great price & quick shipping. Will definitely order from them again.
2,Sandoz Products,This is the second product I have used with this company and the strength of thier product is at least 20 percent less than other brands.
4,Clemestine F review.,"Product works pretty well for me, as with most or all anti-histamines - it lacks perfection. But being OTC and reasonably priced it is fine. I am not sure why this particular antihistimine has lost favor in the marketplace."
4,Recommeded by Vet,My vet recommended this for my chihuahua who has sesaonal allergies. I love that you only need to administer it once a day.
5,Absolute must for any artist,"I just finished this book and it's amazing! With most books I just read it then put it away forever. With Money Management for the Creative Person I am already putting Mr. Silber's valuable advice to work. What is so great about this book is that you not only get a ton of financial advice, but inspiration to keep creating in the face of adversity. The book it packed with real life stories from himself, celebrities and real-life people. It's very motivating. I highly recommend this book even if you feel like your finances are in order and you don't need help."
5,Lady Moorish fish,Cute Fish! My daughter's room is all fish. We hung many small stuffed fish like this on from the ceiling. Looks great.This fish is sparkly and made well. Highly reccommended.
5,Back to the roots,"From out of the west comes a unique sound that captures influences from such legendary Country acts as Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings while combining the melody, songwriting and musicianship of today's biggest country stars. This is ""A Different Brand Of Country"" this is The AK Corral"
2,COMPLICATED AND BORING,After reading the reviews on this I was expecting a fast-paced well written British spy mystery. What I got instead is a long and drawn out overly complicated and boring story. The acting is good but this alone does not make a show good. I was tempted to stop watching in the middle of the series but was hoping for a big ending that would make up for the slow start. It was not worth the wait. I can safely say I will never watch this again.
1,SO Slow - and badly acted!,"Very surprised at the slow pace and bad acting in this British Drama.The character played by Joanne Whalley was SO unrealistic (seductive like smiles while addressing Trade Union rally's for example) that I was actually PLEASED when she got blasted by gunshot in the chest. Even her over dramatic leap in the air on getting shot was over the top! Sadly, her character kept reappearing as a supposedly inspirational spirit to her father.The story drags along too slowly with weepy scenes of reminiscence and an all-too-slow unraveling of this daughter's involvement in something deep and I found myself loosing interest well before the plot started to materialize.I am a true admirer of British drama - but this is one to miss.Even the Eric Clapton soundtrack is slow and laborious.Give this one a miss!"
1,not my cup of tea,"I found the title in an early 2010 review by Joe Morgenstern of the WSJ. Like many of the commenters here, he gave it a rave review. By mistake I originally started the new Mel Gibson version. After I gave up on Mel, on the strength of the reviews, I started the BBC disks. I persevered through the first 3 of the 6 episodes. I won't watch the rest, especially after reading comments that the 2nd 3 episodes are less compelling that the first 3.With some exceptions, its boring, like watching paint dry. I do like Brit productions, generally across the spectrum, but this one is a slow mess. It's not worth the 3+ hours."
3,Scary Bomb Movie,"Bob Peck plays the grieved father of an anti-nuclear activest - a young women murdered in his arms. Slightly crazy and experiencing visits from his dead daughter, Mr. Peck is determined to find the culprits whether he lives or dies. Great acting job by Mr. Peck. All sorts of unsavory things are going on which takes one back to the Cold War when countries and sleezy individuals were finding ways to obtain the makings of ""the bomb"". Underground tunnels, corrupt government officials, and just plain crooks and assassins abound. Don Baker plays a smart and funny CIA agent who works with Bob Peck to resolve the mystery and adds a bit of humor to this otherwise sad and frightening movie."
4,Edge of Darkness,"This eco-thriller has a great start and middle. However, the ending was weak and unsatisfying."
3,great series but not great film print/DVD mastering,"I love this series. One of the greats of all time. I even have the original VHS. I can't believe that the BBC couldn't find a better print or clean up what they have considering it was one of the highest rated series & won top awards. Watchable but grainy & a couple of picture ""streaks' from the video tape master that was used. Edge of Darkness fans in America have been waiting many years for this DVD. Like I said great series but disappointing mastering. I would give it a 5 star rating for the production but I am deducting 2 stars for the mastering & film print."
5,Edge of Perfection,"Edge of Darkness is one of the best programs ever on television. It is the quality of the best feature films, with amazingly sharp, astute writing, brilliant performances by the entire cast, and a story that takes you places you just weren't expecting to go. When this first aired in Britain in the fall of 1986, the public response was so great, it had to re-air only 6 weeks later! The insights into goverment, the nuclear industry, the intelligence community, and ""just people"" are chillingly accurate. It will change the way you view your world, forever."
3,Not as Expected,"After all the positive reviews of this series, I thought I'd enjoy it. What a disappointment. I agree with some reviewers that the show is slow, dark and heavy. I'm also not a fan of the subject matter. After the first disc, I didn't bother to watch the second one since I already have tons of other DVDs just waiting to be watched and I'm sure I'll enjoy them more. Why waste time on this one when so many others are far superior."
5,"Dark, Moody, Excellent Characters, and a Plot to Die For!","This 2-video set will have you wondering where your weekend went! The twists and turns of the plot, the carefully crafted characters, and the fine cinematography will keep you on the edge of your seat. Even the bravura turn of Joe Don Baker rings true in this dark but fulfilling descent into the darkness at the heart of even the most well-intentioned."
3,Not his best,"This is not a terrible book- it is a reasonably entertaining example of that period of sci fi writing. However- how is it possible that the same author of this very dry, somewhat plodding story, wrote the witty, incredibly imaginative ""Men, Martians & Machines""? I was expecting something near that quality and this is not close."
3,"Interesting, not fascinating.","Probably most interesting for its relevance to current times, although it's odd that the protagonist is effectively a terrorist.This story of a saboteur (human) dropped on an alien planet is apparently based on plans Russell worked on during WWII. It's really more of a vehicle for that information, than a well developed story.If you are curious about Russell's work, I'd recommend trying some of his better known short fiction, like ""And then there were none"", which can be found inThe Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two A: The Greatest Science Fiction Novellas of All Time, which you should read anyway, and not just for this story.You can also find the rather amusing ""Allamagoosa"" inThe Hugo Winners - Volumes I & II (Volumes 1 and 2), which is also worth reading for more than just this story."
5,A classic curiously topical.,"This book is a classic in the sense that it is timeless. If you wnat to know how to disrupt a society, then this book is a text book. If you want to know how not to respond to such an attack, which is in many ways remarkably similar to that that took place in New York City on 9/11/01, then this is your book.The idea of such warfare is to provoke a disporportionate reaction, wildly disproportionate if at all possible.It is also a very fun read. Great book. Very perceptive."
5,A definitve military strategy,"I originally read this novel in the 1960's. I've always been impressed with the practical possibilities. I reread this novel in 2008, and since then the republication of this classic has brought the military uses to bear. I hear this wonderful book has actually been used by our military as a textbook strategy for soldiers during enemy territory infiltration."
4,GOOD READ THAT HOLDS UP OVER TIME,"This book is a cross between military sci-fi and gorilla warfare. Very well written and stands the test of time as many of the tactics are just as applicable today but the tech is kind of outdated, which is to be expected of a book this age."
3,Good typical clay stuff,Maureen Carlson is one of my favorite polymer clay artists. This book is great.
1,not so great,"Popcorn microwave popper is a bust. Burned each batch and if you know what burnt popcorn smells like....well, it's not pleasant. only use is as a bowl to hold pre-popped popcorn from another source."
2,Sorry I bought it.,I purchased this to replace a microwave popper that I previously had for 6-7 years and had finally begun to show signs of wear. It leaves a large amount of unpopped kernals in the bowl and what doesn pop isn't enough for me and my 4-year old daughter to split. I would highly recommend buying the one that I had previously as I am going to order one now and throw this one away. Here's the link to the one I love. You can choose to use oil or not with this one. http://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-60120-Microwaver-Popcorn/dp/B00004W4UP/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1283198065&sr=8-4
1,terrible,didnt pop half the popcorn and burned the rest! waste of money I wish i had read the other reviews before buying it!
1,causes microwave oven to spark,"I've been using this Progressive Microwave popcorn popper for many months and I agree with all the comments about it not popping all the kernels, burning kernels, etc; however, I have a new complaint that I thought would be important to pass along. After many uses, It now causes my Microwave oven to spark. I've tested all the other dishes I use in my microwave to isolate the source of the sparking and it only happens when I use this bowl. I've never had any sparking occur in my microwave before this. The popper is going in the trash."
1,Too many unpopped kernels,"I had high hopes for this but it just wasn't working for me. I returned it and bought the Whirley Pop. A completely different ball of wax but I'm happy to be making real popcorn again, not the envelope kind."
2,"Not very good, except for measuring cup in lid!","This product does produce popcorn but you must be careful in its use. I was not the third or fourth time I used it and it started to melt in my microwave.Very easy to burn popcorn with this thing. The last time I used it, last night, I ran it a bit too long and the bottom started to melt as the popcorn burned. This was my fault but it never worked very well. Of course, when I threw the entire thing in the trash, the darn thing melted my trash bag! :-\"
1,Horrible. Do not buy.,"I got this item as a gift. I was very excited to try cooking popcorn that was healthy without the oil and the clean-up. I read the directions through and followed them exactly. On the first try it burned half of the popcorn and left many kernels uncooked. So, I tried again. Same thing happened. It is supposed to take 1-3 minutes to cook the popcorn. At about the 2 minutes popcorn starts to smell burnt even though half of the popcorn has not popped yet. A few kernels got trapped under the plastic disk and melted some of the bowl. Also, after cooking the popcorn, the disk in the bottom is extremely hot and could burn user. Extremely disappointed in this item. Do not waste your money. Horrible design and output."
5,The most exciting of the Graphic novels,Great action and art work combine to keep the reader glued to the pages. The Dust Waltz is a dance of passion and adventure. Everyone is in danger. Angel is in chains. Buffy is their only hope again. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to Buffy fans.
1,it's a comic book!,I thought i was going to get a chapter book but i didn't and it was very dssapointing. ALERT! ALERT! THIS IS A COMIC BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Okay,"This original trade paperback so it doesn't have a mini series type equivalent as far as I know. It introduces Giles' niece as well as dealing with a feud between two ancienct sisters. I really didn't like it that much. There was a lot of fighting and not much character interaction. The artwork is okay but not good enough to make up for what I thought was a contrived story. Demons come to town, demons make trouble, Buffy gets rid of demons. The stuff that is supposed to make it worthwhile is something more than having Xander like Giles' niece. Comics let you do so much with a story, this plays out like the sort of episode you'd skip because it is so formulaic -- stick demon here, mix with a bit of history. . .nothing new. I would buy it again, however, because I'm a completist. Lots of people like this trade so if you want to read a story that does nothing to further the characters, this is it."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This is Buffy's story in Los Angeles. A mostly vapid high school girl, she runs into Merrick, and he explains the whole vampire situation.When Lothos the old flouncy vamp turns up, quite a few people start dying, or becoming not-living. This includes one of her friends.It takes a fairly convincing act of arson to get rid of 'em."
1,Don't But It,"I wish I had seen some of the other reviews here before I bought mine! While it was under warranty, I had several minor issues that their useless customer service department could not help me resolve. In hind sight, I should have just returned it for a refund then. But I was at least able to record DVDs successfully. Many pre-recorded, i.e. purchased, movies would not play at all. Now that the warranty has expired, it will act as if it is recording, with no error messages, but when finished, that disk is recognized as ""empty"". Total piece of crap! I'll never buy another Philips product."
1,Add me to the list of mad customers,"I bought my DVDR80 in August of 2003. About six months ago, it just quit reading DVD+R. It still read DVD+RW. Now it doesn't read them either. Whether the disk is made on the PHillips unit or on my PC with NERO, the disks will not read. IT still reads and plays commercial DVD. I have a $500 DVD player. {Looks snazzy though!} I made ONE recording I kept with this unit. That makes this a $500 recording. I could have bought a lot of DVDs for that. I am going to replace this with a standard DVD player. This was a bad and an expensive idea.Think about it long and hard before you buy this. Wal-mart has a DVD Recorder for about $250. It hurts less to throw one of those away."
1,run and hide this things psychotic,"I am not one generally to anthropomorphize electronics, but after more than a year with this recorder I am left with the notion it has serious problems. I have spent more than 16 hours waiting for and talking to Philips customer service...they can read you the manual, but since you're reading this I assume that will be as much help to you as it has been to me. At this stage I know more than customer service about their machine. The interface is difficult and cumbersome I recommend avoiding the system. It periodically will not recognize DVD-R disks, although it always recognizes DVD-RW media. It randomly changes channels, stops recording in the middle of a program, etc.Try Sony I hear their system is easier to use.This is a shame because when it works it makes beautiful quality images."
2,Noddy,"10-15% on the Wilbur Smith story telling scale.Extremely slow to start.Sex Scenes- Most appear to have been written by a 'Neighbours'script writer.

4,The shoplifter's manual.,"Margaret Rutherford fans should not pass up the opportunity to enjoy the two scenes she has in ""Trouble In Store"". She plays Miss Bacon, an inveterate shoplifter. Nothing is too big or too difficult for her to secrete under her capacious cloaks or in her baggage: canteens of cutlery, rolls of material. Indeed, the items of baggage are themselves shoplifted; to avoid detection she slaps hotel labels on them.The star, Norman Wisdom, earned the BAFTA ""most talented newcomer"" award for his work in this film."
4,Trouble in Store Review,If you like old slap stick British comedy you will like this. Norman Wisdom is great in this movie and some scenes are classic.Dave
5,Gave me a quantum thrill,"This book is written in fairly simple language is is not difficult to comprehend. On the other hand, it talks about very advanced technologies that use completely new medium of computer structure. It's just extremely interesting to read. If this technology will work in the future, becoming practical rather than theoretical, our world will never be the same."
3,Smarthome Insteon Switchlinc V2 Relay,"The product is sensitive to CFL noise. I used it to turn on and off 5 CFLs in parallel, sometimes it could not get the command to turn them off. Reducing number of CFLs to 3, it then worked fine."
3,NASCAR 3-D Not 3D?,I wouldn't necessarily buy this item if it were NOT in 3D as I saw in the IMAX theatre here in Davenport. What's the point putting out a 3D movie in ONLY 2D? Other IMAX movies have been offered in 2D and optional 3D (via Slingshot video) for those who have purchased the equipment for it. C'mon Warners!This was a great and exciting movie in IMAX 3-D.
1,Why?,"I wish I could give it a zeo. Why oh why do they crop down an IMAX Movie to 4:3. I didn't even pay attention to the aspect ratio, as it was IMAX. This completely ruined my viewing experience. What a bugger."
2,Don't Buy It..,"Unlike some of the other detractors of this DVD. I don't care about it not being 3-D or whatever. I was let down in a big way. I am not a big NASCAR fan, but I do live&breathe motorsport , so I thought ""what the heck,this looks good"". While it served as a decent documetary,with interesting facts and so on. I felt the ""action"" portion of the program is what let me down. Simon Wincer missed the mark as far a I'm concerned. The hodge-podge editing of multiple tracks/events as one raceday seemed contrived. Just my humble opinion."
1,BOYCOTT THIS ITEM.... WARNER BROTHERS GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER,WHY WOULD YOU RELEASE THIS IN ONLY FULL FRAME. YOU LOSE HALF THE PICTURE... THE FOLKS WITH WIDESCREEN TV'S AND OUR RANKS ARE GROWING WANT TO SEE ALL OF THE MOVIE THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED.... AND NO 3-D OPTION.. COME ON.. GET IT TOGETHER.... EVEN SHREK CAN BE RELEASED IN 3-D WHY NOT THIS... ... THIS IS LAME. AN IMAX FILM IS TO BE WATCHED IN ALL ITS WIDESCREEN GLORY
3,"Excellent for NASCAR fans, not for 3D collectors","I bought this DVD because of hearing that it was a 3D IMAX film and hoped that Warner Bros. would have did the right thing and made both the 2D and 3D versions available on the disc. Sadly, this isn't the case. Granted, the movie is a NASCAR fans dream with lots of great historical information on the creation of the sport, an in-depth look behind-the-scenes at how the cars are made, what all goes into setting up the pits at the races, etc. and so on. Plus, some wonderful in-car and racing with the vehicles perspectives. But, without the 3D experience, the movie is just not what it could have been. There is still a LOT of room left on this DVD for the field-sequential video edition, plus other interesting extras like a making-of featurette (which is strangely missing for an IMAX disc). I'd like to know why they were left out. In short, get the movie if you are a NASCAR fan, but don't if you believe it will be in 3D like it was at the IMAX theaters."
4,"Very Good,","This was an entertaining disk, even for a non-NASCAR fan. And for informational purposes, the IMAX ratio is almost 1.33:1, I believe the actual ratio is 1.37:1 or therabouts, even with this modified you lose very little image as opposed to a typical theatrical presentation of 1.85 or 2.35:1 where you would lose a good portion of the image in most transfers. Bottomline: don't let the full frame scare you from this release."
3,NASCAR - The IMAX Experience,"Excellent movie, but has some scenes missing from the original shown at Daytona USA."
2,should have included field sequetial option,"5 Stars for the film, 2 stars for the DVD not including the option of watching this in 3-D, for those of us with the equipment we purchased to watch other Imax films in 3-D. I looked forward to watching this at home in 3-D, as I have with other 3-D Imax titles. Shame on you guys for being so cheap! I won't buy this, just because of that. Stop screwing over the 3-D fans! It would not kill you to include the 3-D option, as you have with other Imax films!"
2,Not for Real NASCAR Fans,"Although, the ""action"" was good. The close up footage was not from a real race or of actual Cup cars for that year. Also, the drivers' true identities were hidden by the visors. A real follower or fan of the NASCAR Cup Series would find that to be very irritating and hard to watch. For the casual fan, this DVD would be a worthwhile purchase."
1,Eh...,Music is highly personal... so you might love this album. I thought it was kind of eh. God Monkey Robot is good and worth $0.89. ;)
5,Addictive!,"I can't get these songs out of my head. electricity + drums and motor skills are especially awesome. My existence is better because of this album and I get closer to paradise with each play. Seriously though, it seems that there is something for everyone here and the whole album gels beautifully."
4,Everyone Falls In Love with Tanto and Devonte,"This cd is great. Good dancehall energy and good beats. Not as good as their 2nd cd I think but the energy is way up!! ""Say Wooee"" is one of the best songs, as well as the dancehall anthem ""Everyone Falls In Love"" The rest of the cd is good too. Just pop it in and give it a listen their style and energy will grow on you!!"
4,"Tanto Metro and Devonte- ""Everyone falls in Love""","To me I think this duo was excellent and their songs are lovely and they play in every reggae parties in Zurich. Everyone should check out their new single ""longtime"" it's amaizing. Tanto and Devonte keep it up!"
5,A Foundation From The American Political Landscape,"The 1960s brought such turbulence to the structure of American politics, but one revolution is difficult to find.In this one book, William F. Buckley, Jr., produced an early blueprint to an emerging conservative movement, which ultimately reached fruition in the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan to the office of president.The importance cannot be emphasized enough that the 1964 nomination by the Republican Party of Sen. Barry Goldwater for president began - in part - through the libertarian views set forth by Buckley, Jr. At that convention, conservatives seized the reins of power from the moderate establishment, led by Nelson Rockefeller, though the movement suffered a tremendous defeat in the general election.Up From Liberalism, no matter which edition, is a vital piece of the American political landscape. That it is virtually impossible to find is utterly mystifying."
3,Cute Product,"We bought this lamp when our original lamp with a night light died. It matched the room colors and since my son loved Mickey, it was an easy sell. While it worked, it was great. But it lasted less than a year before the lamp went out entirely. If you buy it, buy it for the decor and not function."
5,"""Tetsuo"" for mathematicians and computer scientists","The makers of ""Pi"" have achieved what I would have thought was impossible: They have made a tense SF thriller about mathematics. The movie has a little of the graphical flavor of ""Tetsuo"", but with a far more gripping plot; a little of the strangeness of David Lynch, but without the feeling that it's being weird for weirdness' sake. Definitely the best film I saw in 1998."
5,"and to do it with only $60,000...","This movie, in my opinion, was one of the greatest... great acting, great plot, great score. It makes you think, but you do not have to have a PHD in math to understand it. It amazes me that such a movie can be made with such a small budget. I highly recommend this movie."
4,Not for fans of Jim Carey,"Probably one of the eerie features of the film was that I used to live at an address of 216, so the symbolism had a little bit of extra ""funkiness"" if I may. The film will pretty much have a very select viewing audience. It probably won't appeal to the mainstream, but it does have the viewer smiling at its quirky moments and eerie mood. As you get into the movie, you feel yourself being drawn into the madness. With each head episode the protagonist has, the results become increasingly severe, pushing the viewer to cringe at each subsequent occurance. If your taste is more drawn to the mainstream, go ahead and watch a film with sophomoric and easy to understand humor, with water added for a watered down plot. If you want a change from the everyday film, Pi is highly recommended."
5,Transcends cyber-thrillers,"Though I am sure the video will eventually (someday) come down in price, I decided to go for it for $33. It was more than worth it; in fact, this is one of the finest of its genre and certainly will be an important ""Gen-X"" film of the future. ""Pi"" tells the techno-laced story of Max Cohen, a mathematician who goes over the edge. As far as math goes, there's chaos, fibonacci numbers, and of course 3.14....... ""Pi"" mixed the hard cyberthrill of ""Tetsuo"" with the mindgame paranoia of ""Conspiracy Theory."" Highly recommended."
3,.,"Stylish and interesting, but there was obviously very little research involved on the part of the writer and/or director. It's enjoyable enough, and thought-provoking in its way, but it doesn't deserve all the lavish praise it's received. Upon reflection it comes off a lot like a well-made student film by a kid who's more infatuated with moody techno than actual mathematics. I liked the ideas the movie explores, and the aesthetics were captivating, but there is an evident amateurism detectable behind it all. An interesting and entertaining debut, but more a clever exercise in style than anything else."
2,for indy enthusiasts only.,"Because I dont think anyone else will honestly enjoy this droning math ""thriller"". I think some people (reviewers perhaps) have a need to see indy films in an unnaturally good light just because they are indies, and out of the elitist disdain for mainstream hollywood fare. Liking ""Pi"" makes them feel suave and sophisticated. I agree about most mainstream hollywood fare being worthless (anyone else just see Hellboy? hell is sitting and watching that for 2 hours) but that doesnt make awful indie films better. It turns out that both high and low budget movies can completely suck and Pi is all the proof you need."
1,Tragically unhip,"Not nearly as clever or deep as it thinks it is. Silly, immature, rambling and overly impressed with itself, yet remarkable in the accuracy with which it has gauged the kind of loser sub-culture at which it is aimed. Grow up, everybody. There is so much less here than meets the eye.It is dark depressing bubble gum. Absolutely nothing of any substance whatsoever."
1,"Interesting music score, not much else","I liked the music score with the cinematography-- the composer did a good job. Otherwise, there is not a lot to recommend this film. It was shallow and pretentious-- I guess it is a film director's idea of what mathematicians think about. I could have spent my time washing dishes and found more meaning than I did in this film."
2,.....rated by a viewer not a film student or a so-called genius,"If you are not into movie making or into the exciting world of mathematics don't even bother to watch this movie. Actually i found the making more interesting than the movie. The movie gives you severe headache and most probably that was intended for. I like low budget cult movies but this is not among them. You can feel the ""movie making 101"" everywhere in this movie. But I can tell its a treat for people who are fond of movies and their skeleton. If you don't care about behind the scene and only interested in a good, eye pleasing and entertaining movie this is not for you. My head still hurts thinking about Pi."
2,3.14???,"This movie pi has a really good idea but it falls way short. Personally i am a math instructor and I value the math part. But the end is what really killed the movie. Also the end doesn't explain anything at all. I loved the whole insanity, drug, and the directing. ""Requiem"" is a much much better film. This one will leave you disappionted."
3,"Overated, It was alright, but some people take it to serious","I had heard so many good things about this movie, yet I found it overrated. It wasn't a complete waste of time, but it was somewhat ""typical"". I have only seen this style previously in books and just a couple B rated movies, they took a few topics that are of interest to esoteric geeks like myself and mangled them together with a bizare style of filming that gets aggrevating very quickly. Alot of people like to disect its meanings in their own way a focus on some deeply intellectual point, but who really cares. This movie didn't hold the meaning of life or fill me with some new found knowledge, and when it was over I wasn't that excited.If you like number patterns buy a book by Wolfram, and if you are interested in religion read the Bible."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to seeing Pi after experiencing Requiem for a Dream, one of the best movies I have ever seen. However, it was quickly apparent that Pi just isn't in the same league. Although the cinematography was beautiful, the plot was pathetic. What a shame."
5,Creative -- Makes you think. Great job!!,"Is there a pattern in PI? If we can find it we will understand the whole world.... I thought the movie was excellent. It made me think about the world differently, and had some fascinating new ideas. Wonderful job. I wish the directors and actors the best of luck. This is what movies should be. Unique, thought provoking and cheap (LOL).Great job!!"
4,Imagine finding the pattern to life itself,"Forget fractals, Fibonacci and Fermat. This is crazy, disturbing, painful, engrossing and so, so simple. I beleived it, I loved it, I even copied his hairstyle. This is a gotta see, but be warned, it stays with you."
5,Mathematics: alluring?,"A black and white film about mathematics? How watchable could that be? In this case, very! The central character, Max, can be described by the cliche 'genius bordering on madness' but he is a multi-layered character, not the stereotypical 'mad scientist'. The theory he is working on is not purely an academic exercise. It has applications in the real world that make Max much sought-after by shady characters looking to profit from the solution. With the rapid succession of cuts and shots that focus upon objects instead of actors, this film resembles a music video (the music sets the mood perfectly, too!) You will get so immersed in Max's head that you will feel the excitement as he gets closer and closer to the solution and as the stakes rise. You will also experience his insistent, growing madness!"
2,A Big Disappointment!!!,"... This movie was terrible and I wanted to like it so much. It's the only movie I have ever seen [UPDATE: this review was written before the release of A Beautiful Mind] to show people playing GO. It has alot of fascinating ideas, it just doesn't know what to do with any of them. What is so astonishing is that these ideas which the movie barely scratches the surface of, the depth of GO, the Fibonnaci series, are so rich as to be wide open to he possiblity of a really great story. It's just too bad the writer could see none of it... or at least how to make a movie about them without resorting to a cheap cop-out ending. Too bad, the ending ruined an otherwise enjoyable movie..."
4,"Intelligent, low-budget science fiction","'Pi' is an audacious debut by Aronofsky that explores some intriguing questions about the link between math and mysticism and shows how far a low budget can go with boldness, intelligence and imagination."
4,It can't go wrong with such enticing premises.,"You should definitely agree that it's one of those great movies at a very low price. And it's not all that featureless. There's a small 'behind-the-scenes' type segment, where you get to meet most of the crew behind the movie, production notes, and notes on pi itself (to give you a better perspective on concept). There's also two commentary tracks (Darren and Sean), which are namely what stand out most of the features. You can't go wrong with commentary tracks on low-budget movies. They're just so entertaining."
4,forgot the h in the middle,"pi should have been called phi, which they refer to as theta in the movie.well done for so cheap."
4,very complex,"this movie is very complex and I don't even fully understand which is why I'm still looking at it but I can tell it's a great movie. it's about a mathematician who stumbles upon a 216-digit number with whom some other people are looking for. at some point it lands him in trouble and running for his life. can tell you anymore. also I have some questions about the film like what was that sitting brain and what was that wrinkle on his forehead? If any of you guys know the answers to these questions, e-mail me at cupofmetal@aol.com"
5,Too close for comfort.,"The movie is amazing. I saw my own life taken to an extreme and given to all the viewers to pick apart. It made me very uncomfortable. I loved it. Anyone who does not like the movie either (A) hates math, (B) hates computers, (C) hates black and white films, or (D) hates electronic music. The film is probably my favourite film of all time. Darren Aronofsky is brilliant."
4,Pretty cool,"This was definitely one of the better movies I have seen in the past year, but it's not quite on the top five list of all time or anything. I read one review here which said something to the effect of, ""A college level math course should be pre-requisite before viewing."" Again, I wouldn't go that far. I just think someone finally figured out an interesting package for the whole ""patterns in the chaos, chaos in the patterns"" hook. But there were some gripes. There were a couple of stinker lines that made me laugh out loud, but the dialogue was great for the most part. The music, however, was totally enveloping and amped the whole experience. I hate giving it the ""indie/gen-x"" tag, but rather think it was just a solid flick worth a couple passes."
4,The thin line between genius and insanity,"An excellent look at how genius borders insanity. Not only does the main character, Max, posses great intelligence, but he is also very wary of those around him (with good cause). The supporting characters portray all that is ugly in society when a key to possibly unlock wealth and power is presented to them. Twists and turns on what Max debates is real and what is hallucination show the inner struggle of a genius searching for an answer. Max fights for what he thinks he wants, but in the end realizes that not having all the answers is a saner way to live."
3,"Dark, disturbing drama","I didn't really know what to expect from this film. It is all black and white and centers on a mathematician trying to find some mathematical solution to the stock market - it turns out corporate america and some Hassidic Jews are very interested in the solution he is nearing. The story has promise, but it doesn't really develop very well and in the end I wasn't satisfied. I don't think this movie is for everyone."
5,Last Digit Of Pi,"The plot itslef may not be great, but the film taking is super. The Black&White gave extra flavor, since this movie is based on the simple yet complex element: numbers. since the movie is insane, ""what the...? "" poped in my mind everywhere in this movie. Good stuff."
1,Horrible Dribble,"What a waste of videotape. This movie has no clue about the stock market, about mathematics or about religion - the 3 subjects it is trying to integrate. It's just a mess."
1,Terrible!,There are no zeroes in the hebrew numerological system. It is not possible to create a specific 216 letter word in Hebrew given a 216 digit number with zeroes in it. This movie is a terrible mess all over.
1,Horrible waste of time,"This has to be the absolute worst movie I have ever had the mispleasure of watching. The characters were not appealing, the filming was washed out, and the story was predictable.I sugguest you steer far away from this horrid example of what people claim is a good film. Rent ""A Beautiful Mind"" instead if you want this type of genre."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time,It is with regret that I have even taken the time to warn you against this exercise in futility.
2,"""L'Age Blanc .......""","Slightly like yesterday's soup, this tribute to Luis Bunel ['L'Age d'or', 'Un Chien Andalou', etc.] creepily pulls the viewer along its rather 'high-school' conceived plot - everything has a formula, everything reduces to numbers ....Visuals are interesting but repeated - especially in the editing of the later ""Requiem for a Dream"" - although it's taunting to imagine what this director might have done to 'Solaris"" - [yes, there's also the obvious Kubrick kick - and quite a lot of Roman Polanski's ""The Tenant"" thrown in for good measure ...Well, back to the drawing board .... but leave the ants to Bunel...."
1,Fell Asleep,I did not like this movie in the least. It was a chore to watch and find the point. I had to stop the movie 3/4 of the way through and go to bed I was so bored.
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This film is so terrible that I couldn't even GIVE my ill-gotten copy to the DVD rental place. Do not believe the good reviews. If you do, you'll be sorry."
1,No Good Film,I hated this terrible movie. It is not good at all. The only good part of this movie was that it was in B&W. It was very wierd and in my opinion a bad movie.
3,Doesn't Quite Deliver,"I was willing to follow this unusual story anywhere, but it ultimately goes nowhere. There have been much better movies about the fine line between genius and mental illness, alienation, paranoia, and city life in general. There is a subplot about the place of jewish men in culture and technology, but even that fizzles out before it has really begun. When you start with a weak script, the actors can only do so much."
2,"""Eraserhead"" shows more character development...","Patterns are everywhere, true enough. Eighth grade mathematics class starts to reveal this to all but the most blind of children. An intriguing premise for a movie? Indeed. That (and all of the glowing Amazon reviews) prompted my purchase of ""Pi"". I must say that visually, the movie is a treat, and I watched it all of the way through. It is a movie that showcases the director's vision and abilities, but it is ultimately nullified by a cast of characters that could easily be bested by the literally two-dimensional troupe of ""South Park."" My recommendation to director Aronofsky: Remake the movie from the point that the main character trepans himself... make the movie about the rediscovery of his madness, make him more human. That ""Staring Into The Sun"" bit is nowhere near enough."
2,"It aspires to be pretentious,","as a friend of mine said. The storyline is simplistic, which would be no problem were the imagery not so overused and the dialogue not so terrible (""But maybe it's genius!""--perhaps the director's wistful thoughts on his own film?).Maybe this is why the movie is as bad as it is: it mixes the storyline of the quest to know the secrets of the universe with a bunch of paranoiac gibberish. It doesn't focus enough on the emotional and spiritual consequences of Max's quest to know the mind of God. We never get enough sense of Max Cohen as a character to empathize with him. Hence my feeling that the movie is juvenile, because it puts him through a lot without allowing us to feel with him."
1,Waste of time,"If you ever use just half of your brain, then you've already read the books and seen the movies Pi ""rips-off."" Overrated. Don't buy it and only rent it for a weak laugh."
5,Cheerio,The best of the best on this service cheerio! I think that anyone would be happy to work with this awesome company.
3,A good low buget indie pic..,"Pi is good because using low-budget constraints the director has managed to do a remarkable job of it all, however like most other reviews do say the movie does fall short and never really gets around to sorting itself out and opts for an ending that is shocking but does not really pay-off. Watch it for a good job done on a very small budget with limited characters."
5,A movie of many philosophical and religious ideas.,"I was very interested in reading all the reviews here and elsewhere, but few people understand what Aranofsky was trying to do, IMHO. They believe this movie is about madness, it's not. Neither is the main character crazy, he's a mystic who tries to shut out the physical and spiritual and realizes he can't do either. This movie is about the convergence of science and religion to one point, the search for an absolute truth which transcends the very words(numbers) that define it. It is a common theme in mytholgy, art, literature, philosophy. The search for God/absolute truth is an essential desire and drive of human nature, but in the acquiring you transform yourself from human into something else. And this path can be extemely painful and has consequences. There are many different ideas and symbolisms in this movie, all centering around this main theme. Please rent it if you can't buy it."
4,"Fair cinematography, interesting actors, but superb sound.","This film was surely backed by some serious hype, yet I left my little home theatre unsure whether or not it was as excellent as I had heard. The dialogue, especially Cohen's internal, was interesting. Number theory was backed intelligently: ""Personal note; restate my assumptions ..."" The soundtrack definitely worked perfectly, and, in my opinion, was the greatest asset of this piece."
1,Are you joking?,"This indeed is a low budget film and one of the worst sci-fi movies I've seen. It's totally in black and white, which is not disclosed in description of the film as far as I can see. The acting is very lame, with little dialog. I found myself clinking the fast forward button to skip large portions of the film consisting of no dialog and just animated screams from the main character. He continually takes drugs of some sort for no clear reason other than headaches. The sound quality is so poor that it's difficult to make out the short dialog when it does occur.How anyone can rate this as anything other than 1 or zero stars is a mystery to me."
1,Not the geek movie that I expected.,"This movie was not as good as I had expected. I had figured that there would be more interesting math involved. This seemed like more of a weird religous film than a interesting movie based on math.The plot was not that interesting. It is entirely in black and white, and the cameraman appears to be an amatuer, or at least going for that bumpy Blair Witch style. I would bet that this was produced by film students that have not yet figured out how to make good movies.Don't waste your money on this movie, there are so many other good movies at Amazon.com that you could buy instead!"
1,Very dissapointed,"The name ""Pi"" really sold, so I bought the movie. I consider myself having a little-bit-above-average math knowledge, so perhaps that is the reason I bought it.BUT, I should say I found it a very stupid movie, and I am very surprised for all the positive comments I have found here.Anyway, if you want to see this movie because of math, don't do it, but if you like extremely bizarre movies, then this is a movie for you."
1,For the pseudo-intelectual losers,"Another movie that tries to appeal to the growing mainstream of pseudo-intelectuals who are just a bunch of losers. The photography is grainy and in many scenes the camera moves around too much. The story itself is very decadent. The movie ridicularizes the attempt of humankind to understand the world. It is suggested that only the simpleminded can find happiness. So, if you think you are smarter than other people, and think that that superiority is the cause for your problems and your sad life you will probably like this movie. If you are not one of those people don't waste your time and money watching it."
4,"The Spiral, the spiral you fools!","I rate this film... 3.14! Get it? I rounded it off to four (4) stars since there is no 3.14. Math fanatics may question the decision to round up, but I say three is not enough. Is four too much? Perhaps, but that is like doing an equation that involves a circle (or a SPIRAL!)and saying, Hmmm. Maybe I'll just plug in... three. I don't even want to think about how ridiculously incorrect the answer would be. It probably wouldn't even be a selection in the multiple choice categories of A, B, C, D, and sometimes E. On the other hand, four (4) may be used in order to get an answer in this lineup of choices, provided of course that the professor had lost his marbles! Better to go with choice E than embarrass yourself. Statistically speaking, provided E= None of the above, it would be best to choose either B or D. Unless of course there is not an E, in which case you would choose C."
1,Really Really FUNNY!!,I roared with laughter at this thing. Anyone who knows a little bit about mathematics knows that Math is just a metaphor for reality. It is not reality! The main character was portrayed as some sort of tormented genius who was supposedly a legitimate mathematician. Nope. This dope was just another garden variety monomaniac. The movie takes itself WAY WAY too seriously.A fine line between genius and madness? Baloney. This guy was just a screwball. There's lots of them around.
1,Number madness,"My previous attempt to review this film apparently ""censored"" by Amazon.com staff, and rightly so, considering the words I had used... I think that I would not need to say much more.However, I must confess something about me: I hate cyberpunk and I hate hip-hop even more! I don't think that the ideas are so original in this film and I believe it is somewhat overrated. By for me, that is beside the point. I find this film very aestehtically dipleasing and I could barely force myself to watch it.I do understand that certain people may have a completely different opinion thatn mine, but that is a matter of personal taste. As another viewer said, ""you'll either love or hate"" this film. Apparently, this film was reviewed by people who loved it (who knows, other angry reviews might have been removed and people didn't bother again! ;-).So, that is my warning to anyone pondering to buy this film, especially after having read the raving reviews here... :-)"
3,Duchess,"I was interested in the figure in Math called Pi. Why would Pi be soimportant and useful for so long and still be more than a Whole Number?Pi = 3.1516. This movie is good at introducing the world of numbers to anyone. The whole escense of Pi is not covered in the movie. But it is a great start into the meaning both spiritual, and mystical regarding numbers."
2,Doesn't hit the right marks.,"This is a short story dragged out for 81 mins. Thats right 81 mins and this movie was too long. The black and white picture didn't work at all for me. I dont understand why in this particular movie that they would use black and white instead of just regular color. The black and white picture made it hard to see what was going on in the very few action moments of the film. The movie for the most part was boring. The acting for the most part was pretty good which is probably the biggest upside of them film. This is not a movie you should buy but one you should rent if you must watch it at all.Pros: acting and premise, which in the long run didn't pay off.Everything else hits the con margin making this a two star movie."
2,PI-DDLING,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I had read all the reviews and had high expectaions. After seeing it I felt nothing. I was not disturbed, unnerved, did not replay scenes or have questions running in my mind. Just because a movie is plodding and pedantic does NOT mean it is a masterpiece. The only aspect of this movie that saves it from a zero is that it looks great. B&W does create a certain bleakness."
5,A Creepy Flick,"This movie gives me chills. It's creepy. There isn't much of a message to it, to say nothing of a serious plot... It's sort of a modern B movie. Like a PCP-induced Plan 9 from Outer Space, it's peculariarity makes it difficult to turn away from, and the electronic soundtrack and gritty black and white feel just add so much more to the viewer's perception of the characters and the flick as a whole. It's great."
5,Movie for the mathematically inclined,"Pi is a beautiful movie about the mind, and what can happen if you try to hard. The lead character practically blows his own mind trying to figure the stock market. If math is your thing you have to see this movie. If knowledge is your thing, you also have to see this movie."
4,"Intriguing, thought-provoking, and......um, BIZARRE.","Pi is such a bizarre movie that by the time you've finished watching it, you feel like you've just seen a toss-up of wacky images that don't relate to each other. But it is also very gripping and interesting. There's really no way to describe the plot in a few sentences. But I can say that it's about a genius schizophrenic scientist who loves numerical patterns, and he searches for the numerical pattern that created the universe, which develops into an earth-shattering sequence of 216 numbers. The music is eerie and excellent for the complex scenario. The black-and-white cinematography is simply not to be believed! But the ending and plot is so bizarre, it's hard to find anyone whom I know will not find any flaws in Pi. Or maybe they will. I'm just 14 years old, so I don't know everything.Rated R, for bizarre and disturbing images, and for language. The atmosphere is also very intense. Too intense for preteens if you ask me."
4,"Overly ambitious, but interesting","Pi reminded me of Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco, minus Eco's seven years of research and spellbinding detective-story style. Overall, the film's pretty good if you're interested in numerological mysticism, but is at times self-important and overreaching. Gives you interesting stuff to think about, though."
5,Pi is not for the Amature movie goer,"With perhaps one of the best scripts of the century, Pi delivers in a unique style and presents the viewer with more to think about than any other film of the year. With an incredibly unusual approach to film (such as the fuzzy black and white appearance throughout the entire film) the director incinuates more than tells a story in Pi. On the whole, Pi is one of the greatest Independent films ever made, but a caution to the amature movie goer - this film is NOT mainstream. Don't expect to find an enduring, heartwarming film for the whole family - this one is for those who want to take back something from their film going experience and not just sit and blank out all thought."
5,One of the five greatest films ever.,As an art student at the Cooper Union in Manhatten I'm usually open to anything. I was anticipating this movie's release and I wasn't disappointed. I've changed my major to film as a result of seeing Pi.
4,Mystical mathematics,"Leaving more unsaid than shown, I found this film to be fascinating as well as thought- and discussion-provoking. For those of us using science as our primary road for a spiritual journey, this movie is a must."
1,forget it,This movie was explained to me before I watched it. It sounded good. I hated it. I had no sympathy for the main character. Some people loved it. Why??? I'm not signing this because I don't want all it's fans to write me. Sometimes you pick a loser movie and this was one of them for me. Don't compare it to the Truman show. That was great. (The person next to me in the movies hated it-go figure).
1,I can see why it only cost 68 grand to make.,I came to this site and read all these glowing reviews about what a great movie this was then I watched and to put it simple IT SUCKED!!!!
1,Very bad movie,This is the worst movie of all time. The only way it could have been worse is to have been longer.
2,"Dont buy into the hype--rent ""A Beautiful Mind"" instead","This movie is a classic of the psuedo-intellectual hipster genre. It has the optimal mix of drugs, weirdo-psychotic behavior, and pop mathematics to take the hippy psuedointellectuals on a fanatastic voyage into a world where they matter. The truth is, this movie is more focused on the drugs and the weirdo-psychotic behavior than the math, and so the name ""Pi"" is misleading. This is not a movie about mathematics nor a mathematician. If is was trying to be, it did a really bad job. Number theory unlocking the secret to the stock market? The number 216? This is not serious mathematics. Hence the movies' plot is meaningless to people who really know what applied mathematics is about--all that is left is the drugs and the weirdo-psychotic nonesense. Two stars."
1,best movie ever no......NO,"I found this movie how shall I say it Lame! I am a very, very open minded guy but I didnt get into it. The concept of the movie deal with numbers. Found it to be to far-fetched. Also the camera angles and the whole black and white feeling of the movie left much to desired. It a must rent movie!!!"
1,ACK!,"How dare they use the term ""Number Theory"" in this movie?!?!?!? I'm outraged and insulted by the nonsense that numerology would be considered mathematics! Pi is a number like any other number. There are an infinite number of numbers with the same properties as pi. So what would make pi any different? That is the one that every student of basic geometry learns about and ""someone"" didn't do the research to bother to find out of the plot would make any sense to anyone who studied higher mathematics!"
5,brilliant,"This movie truly intrigued me. Not once did it lose my attention or bore me. I'm not ""into"" math but I understood everything, it's complex, but still understandable. One of my top ten movies...."
2,Come ON! What is this ABOUT?,"I am always trying to support independant filmakers, but... This film is confusing. Unnecessarliy confusing. It is not nearly as clever as I feel it is intended to be. This film is perfect for phony intellectuals who like to stand out by claiming to love films that are too obscure and confusing for ""average"" filmgoers to comprehend. I must admit, however, that Aronofsky DID do an excellent job with direction. Yet,I feel that he just tried too hard with this film. The viewer leaves ""Pi"" with a sense that something is truly missing. The film also tends to bring out emotions of anxiety and rage in the viewer. When I was through watching this film, I felt like jumping out of a window, or attacking somebody."
5,Rolling Numbers...,"Max (Sean Gullette) is a troubled soul. He is a mathematical genius, searching for a number that will unlock the mysteries of the stock market. He's not doing this for profit. He is driven by his life-long obsession with / passion for number patterns in systems. All systems, in all of creation. To Max, the chaos of the universe is just a complex puzzle to be solved in order to see the numerical patterns in it. Unfortunately, Max has pushed himself beyond his own capacity. He's beginning to unravel. Can he find this elusive pattern before his total mental collapse? PI is the story of order in chaos, insanity in genius, and nightmare folded up in waking reality. Darren Aronofsky (REQUIEM FOR A DREAM) has fashioned a tense, suffocatingly paranoic, schizoid dreamscape for Max to explore. Danger and doom hang over every scene like lead aprons! Wondrously bleak..."
4,Groundbreaking at the time,"1998 film that I recently re-watched. I remember being more impressed the first time I saw it. I think the style of film-making was groundbreaking at the time, but now it seems a little more annoying than interesting. Still, an intriguing story and well acted."
4,Unique,"Pi is a very interesting movie about a math genius who tries to outsmart the stock market. Unlike any movie you've ever seen. One of Darren Aronofsky's lesser acclaimed works, but is still amazing. If you liked Requiem for a Dream you'll really enjoy Pi."
2,very good student film,"Don't rush out to see it, it's really just a very well-done student film. But it very effectively sustains a desperate and claustrophobic air, enough so that you mostly forgive its many flaws, which include reliance on dream sequences and no real investigation of the implications of its own ideas. It has the momentum of a great movie, without being one."
1,feel the pain,"I wanted to spend some time with my son,and he suggested Pi,which had been sitting on the shelf for a few months,as it was part of a two-pack with Requiem for a Dream{a very good film}.Big Mistake!Grainy black and white with annoying soundtrack,the high point being an orbital tune{the girl with the sun in her head,i believe}.The most offensive sounds were when Max,the protagonist,was having his many migraines,which increase in intensity.The plot concerns Max's search for meaning through numbers.He becomes obsessed and his life becomes a downward spiral of pain and paranoia to the final,drill-induced resolution.If this sounds like your cup of misery,enjoy,and don't forget the advil."
2,"A bit ""out there"".","A grainy B&W film which I found confronting. My teenage son wanted it, so I sourced it through Amazon. He enjoyed the film quite a lot, but I found the storyline a little tedious. Acting was very good. A film that is 'a bit out there'!"
4,Strange film for those that like out-of-bounds stuff.,"Interesting little film with multiple aspects to it. Not ordinary Hollywood by a long shot and presents some interesting things to contemplate. Not sure worth 3 or even 2 views but certainly 1. Not a ""date"" movie. For males. Computer literate males. More than computers."
5,picking at the bad reviews,"""I can see why it only cost 68 grand to make. I came to this site and read all these glowing reviews about what a great movie this was then I watched and to put it simple IT SUCKED!!!! 'not for beavis and butthead"" the films ideas are portayed excellently but the producers seemed to forget that the plot did not have a real destination.""does it have to? i hate preconceptions....""The idea was good but the actual production was horrible.""dollar for dollar it looks better than hollywood pap. better camera work, too""The acting was bad and all the actors played two dimensional empty parts""wrong. one or two of them weren t too sharp.""This movie probably should not have been shown to mainstream America... ""ram it down their fat faces""if you want better dialogue, watch anything from Quentin""?"
1,What a waste of time.,This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I expected better after reading the reviews on this site but then it came to me and I realized that the only people who write reviews are the few who liked it. So I figure I should balance the reviews out by telling you this movie is a total waste of time.
4,Great review for the NCLEX,This book provided a great review for the NCLEX-RN. It highlighted areas the NCLEX keys in on. It also includes a great sample test to get you ready for the NCLEX format. I recommend it!
5,Just what the doctor ordered: medicine for souls,"You MUST read this book!I have read this book about 5 times already. It is short but so thorough that you will not be disappointed if you believe in hell and want to avoid going there when you die.St. Alphonsus breaks down this treatise into short sections on the pains of hell, the reality of hell, the ways to avoid going there, and most helpful are prayers following each section that help the penitent turn to Mary and Jesus for spiritual weapons to protect us against the pains of hell, which are for ever.A must read for all Catholics, and all Christians who believe in hell. Please buy this book, keep it on your night stand, and read it often. You will not regret it."
5,Eye opener,"This book makes you reflect on how short life is, how we need to prepare our souls for the last judgement and lightens up your concious to what is the most important moment of our life... death."
5,"A little bit of everything, and it all works...","This CD covers topics as far flung as security blankets and world domination, Einstein and the closeness of a family trip.Each song is unique like a necklace of diverse and beautiful, beads. I appreciate Lesnicks folky music, his message and find his uncensored, unpretensious lyrics refreshing. Check it out."
4,Nice,The clutch is beautiful and well made. The delivery was fast and it was well-packaged. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars was that I wish the display image was of higher resolution and maybe with a zoom feature so to get a better idea of the detail of work. But I am very happy it and I am very glad I got it.
4,Please dont stop here,Surely it is enought to say that you hope and pray Charles Barnitz will write another such book. I have been watching and waiting a long time. Please dont let me down. This in a very good read indeed.
3,Film House Fever,"The point of this movie is to showcase bad movies, as it says on the back cover, and it's pretty spot on. A lot of the movies clips shown are bad. It's the good, the bad and the ugly of the worst movies ever made. It also highlight's some of the first movies made by beloved actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis, David Carradine and James Keach. It's also nice to see a baby Steve Buscemi and Mark Boone Jr as the hosts of this delectable film treat."
2,less than an hour of clips - still needs editing,"It's amusing to see a young Steve Buscemi in the linking bits, but the clips are often poorly chosen (IMO) and end up being painfully long excerpts from painfully bad movies (mostly Hershell Gordon Lewis).Titles are given for only a portion of those shown. Contents include:Living Venus (1960)Daughter of the Sun (1962)Blood Feast (1963)Sex and the College Girl (1964)Two Thousand Maniacs!Bad Girls Do Cry (1965)Color Me Blood Red (1965)Something Weird (1967)The Gruesome Twosome (1967)The Psychic (1968)Just for the Hell of It (1968)She-Devils on Wheels (1968)The Wizard of Gore (1970)Dracula Vs. Frankenstein (1971)Steel Arena (1973)Rocktober Blood (1984)Sno-Line (1984)Suburbia (1984)The Warrior and the Sorceress (1984)Also included are clips of two early Sam Raimi films:Toro, Toro, ToroCleveland Smith, Bounty Hunter"
1,how not to sound on a talkbox,The talkbox vocals on this CD sucks! No harmonies what so ever and he's faking the talkbox... he's not even using one! This guy should listen to the works of Zapp and frontman Roger Troutman for more lessons.
5,An outstanding and important piece of work,"If you ever wanted to know anything about Albert Camus, this is the book to read. An exceptional job of research and writing. I hated to see it end. Oliver Todd is an excellent writer and his book a joy to read."
1,Terrible,"One hopes that the French edition, which is 400 hundred, not 100, pages longer, is considerably better, but I find that hard to believe. The writing is unacceptably choppy and awkward, with paragraphs springing from nowhere and sentences shifting from one grand topic to another without stopping. It's almost laughable. Chock full of details and totally lacking in style or spirit, this book will only be useful to those seeking a blow by blow chronology of Camus' life - and the chronology is uneven at best (many times Todd goes back several months without clear indication).Poor writing wouldn't be a problem if there was at least a point of view, but Todd offers us none, preferring instead to recounting facts and quoting at length from Camus' letters. The fact that Camus was such a crystalline writer only makes this book seem like more of an insult.I was hugely disappointed by this book. (...)"
3,Excellence diminished for American readers,"It is a pity that so fine a biography has been shorn of all notes and bibliographic mateerials. A pity and inexplicable, since American interest in Camus has always been great. I am more bothered by these omissions than by the abridgment; this biography reads more smoothly than Lottman's great pioneering 1978 effort, which included information just because it was there. Readers interested in a biography may want to wait; since 2013 is Camus's centenary no doubt new biographical and critical works will be available. I know that Robert Zaretsky's biography will be published at some point.In the meantime, readers unconcerned about Todd's sources will enjoy his text."
4,the best drama iv'e seen in a while,I cant beileve that this movie has only rented seven times in the video store i work in. It is the best drama iv'e seen in a long time great acting from everybody especially Paul Sorvino. It will make think about your life and what happens when you get close to too 40. And also being betrayed by your closest friends
2,An Anthem for The Klan,"A very disappointing and tedious exercise that will hopefully prevent Paul Sorvino from directing another film. Except for another fine performance by Gary Sinise, don't expect to be moved, either physically or emotionally. It flows like a series of cliched bigotries, with no specific direction. The dialog spoken by the coach (Sorvino) is as vitriolic as the Edward Norton character in American History X, (and would most certainly be embraced by neo-Nazi groups). But at least in that movie, Norton's character experienced some ultimate redemption. In this film, the audience receives nothing in return for spending 2 hours with a quintet of pathetic white males. Yuck."
3,Fairly Decent,"While the Metal Fabricator's Handbook provided some insight into working with metal, it didn't provide as much information as I had expected.Ron does a good job of detailing the tools you will need to work with metal, but does not spend much time actually showing you what to do.Most of the projects were presented in a general way, he didn't touch much on the specifics of how to do complete the tasks. It was more like watching a 30 minute show on how to fabricate many parts associated with a race car. Surely you cannot expect to be able to take this information and build a race car.All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the trade. Even if you manage to learn one thing from this book, it's one thing you didn't know prior to reading it."
4,fournier rules,This book paid for itself at page 3 and has continued to do so ever since. Why no 5 star rating well its because I cant afford some of the equipment and he provides no poor mans alternative.
3,Not remarkable,"I never saw someone doing this job before, so, I could'nt understand all the procedures the author explained. The fotos are dark and hard to see. I will try another one."
3,good but old,"This book was written in the early eighties, and it shows. There is some valuable information, but it is aimed at the sheet metal shaping world- for instance, how to put compound curves into metal.Some of the information is fairly folkloric."
3,outdated,"Bought the book recently. I find it very outdated. The pictures show all sorts of operations going on without any modern saftey measures employed! Things like die grinding or 5"" disk grinding with operators nearby without any safety glasses or disk guards in-place! Makes me cringe.Other than that, it does show some good ways and tools to form sheet metal. The entire bent of the book is fabricating sheet metal for cars, so if you are not into making car sheet metal....I give it a C+"
3,"Okay, but disappointed.","I liked this book and was hoping that there was a lot to be shared. When I received it, I find out it's not the newest version but nearly 30 years old. For a few dollars more, I could have gotten the new version and have it new. When the shipping is added in, I would have just gone to the store and purchased exactly what I wanted. While the basics are still covered in it, a lot has progressed in the past 25 plus years that the newest one would be much more imformative."
2,"This book is outdated, not enough clear colored pictures.","This book is outdated, not enough clear ( colored ) pictures.Good, quality clear pictures are a must for hands-on trade, skill and craft books.A Lot of the information in this book you can find on the internet for free.Don't waste your money on this book.If you want to learn how to do something, this book might help, if you don't know what a welder or a grinder is."
3,Pull-lease,"I purchase these books for a great fast read, lots of hot sex and a quick clean-up. None of these things are found within these pages. Don't wast your time."
3,An improvement from Milne,"This is novel number two in Luc Milne's Pleasure Corporation series. Here we find troubled or in trouble young men in a private school, I think it may be a college but it is unclear frankly. The ""lessons"" and ""rules"" posted throughout the book can be distracting but they add to the atmosphere of a school experience. ... To put it bluntly: its a training academy for future ... workers, many of whom have been sent their without explicit consent. If that sounds to you, you might like this book."
2,A disappointing end...,"What started out with Iroshi, the first book in a trilogy with amazing potential, ends with a disappointing Persea. Throughout the series, there is minimal character development, and the plots get shallower and shallower. I was hoping for much more. bsudy@bigfoot.com"
2,KAITTE-RN,"COLOR VERY PRETTY BUT THATS WHERE THE GOOD STOPS! THE REST OF IT IS NO GOOD! I BOUGHT THIS STETH AT THE BEGINNING OF NURSING SCHOOL AND I WISH I HADN'T. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR A HEARTBEAT NEVER MIND LUNG OR BOWEL SOUNDS. THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIALS IS VERY LOW GRADE, AND BOTH EAR SETS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, DUAL HEAD A JOKE SMALLER SIDE (POSSIBLY PEDs BUT COMPLETELY UNUSABLE- BESIDES ONLY COMES WITH 1 DIAPHRAGM AND COULD NOT FIND A PRESTIGE DIAPHRAGM FOR PURCHASE THAT WOULD FIT SM SIDE ANYWHERE! NEEDLESS TO SAY, I GAVE IT TO MY 8 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER FOR PLAY AND BOUGHT ANOTHER BRAND- THIS TIME THROUGH AMAZON- WHICH I AM THRILLED WITH! WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS STETHOSCOPE FOR ANYTHING BUT ""DRESS-UP"" OR A HALLOWEEN COSTUME. I WOULD RECOMMEND EITHER LITTMANN OR AMERICAN DIAGNOSTIC. I BOUGHT THE LITTMANN (AWESOME BUT PRICEY) AND GIVEN AN AMERICAN DIAGNOSTIC (WHICH WORKS NEARLY JUST AS WELL- AND MORE AFFORDABLE. I AM NOW OUT OF SCHOOL AND AN RN AND MY LITTMANN WAS THE BEST INVESTMENT!"
2,Doesn't work well.,"I bought this recently, and when I received it I tried it out and could barely hear my own heart beat or anyone elses. I Thought it might be the part where you put in your ear, so I tried the other ones it came with, and they killed my ears, I could hardly keep them in for even a minute. I bought it because I thought the BP cuff I ordered didn't come with one, but it ended up coming with one and it is SO much better than this one. When I tried it for the first time, I realized how defective this one was."
1,Low Quality,"Disappointing experience. I ordered one for a doctor. After trying it on, he laughed saying he can't hear with it. He said it can be a toy for a child to play 'pretend' game. I returned it."
1,Low quality,Earpieces are made from very hard plastic and almost can't hear at all the heart beat. I returned the item.
5,"Its Not Just About Golf, It's About Living","The golfer and the millionaire is a great book about the realities of life, you are either living or dying. The main character in this book Robert is dying. He has given away all of his dreams and only has his fading talent and good looks remaining.He has given away those things that make you successful. He has stopped trying. The book deals with the rebirth of Robert and his attempt to achieve success in not only his golf, but in the other far more important parts of his life.Robert is fortunate enough to meet someone who awakens him, and helps show him the door to achieve his greatest level in life. Many people, whether golfer or not, can benefit from this book as we all look to be our most successful in life."
2,Og Mandino for third grade mentalities,"The book has great ideas, but it reeks of metaphors and similes found in high school term papers. If you mildly like this book, Og Mandino will blow you away with THE GREATEST MIRACLE IN THE WORLD."
3,Good by lacking something,"This is definately not one of McNaught best books. For some reason I hadn't read this one until recently, and I must say I was disappointed. The characters had a lot of potential, but I just could feel for them what I have for other of McNaught's characters. It may have been that I couldn't get over the breaking out of prison storyline, but I found the plot lacked depth. The inferences to Matt and Meredith seemed pushed, and I really like these two characters. I wanted to see them again.If you like JM, read this book, it is just not one to get you hooked on the author like some of her other books."
2,Can't say how disappointed I am...,"I so wanted to read this book. Her other books are just incredible.What a disappointment this was. I couldn't even finish it and I hate doing that. But I couldn't waste any more time on squeaky clean, unrealistically perfect, dumb Julie and I don't feel any nicer towards Zach. I am just sad, this is the first time McNaught has every disappointed me and I have read almost all of her books."
5,"Perfect is the book, the characters and the feeling you get","I still think about Julie and Zach almost as if they were real people that I met somewhere.Julie and Zach are, on the surface, as different as night and day. She is an orphan adopted and raised by a loving family and Zach is a Hollywood star wrongly convicted of killing his wife. The fact that these two meet at all is based on the coincidence of his escaping from jail and her taking a road trip.What follows is one of the best, most touching and sweet love stories I've ever read. Zach kidnaps her and forces her to drive him to a remote cabin (belonging to the characters from the book Paradise). There, Julie begins to believe in Zach's innocence. And Zach begins to see an innocence in Julie that he thought didn't exist.As usual, McNaught's characters are real, flawed, loveable and easy to relate to. Most of all, you genuinely feel for them. One of the best contemporary romance novels I've ever read."
3,Too Many loose ends,"While I loved Paradise, I was so-so on this quasi sequel! The interaction between the main characters is sometimes forced, but the romance scenes are nice. She creates WAAAYYY too many characters, and half of them-including a brother simply disapear. Not even a sentence to finish them off. It got to be annoying, like the fact that his prison cellmate who was his brother and his extended family didn't even get invited to the wedding? What happened to Paul Richardson? Not one of her best."
1,"In one word, 600 pages of corny","After reading all the rave reviews, I went out quickly to purchase this book. I became very disappointed when I realized this is the kind of writing that is found in Danielle Steele's novels (sorry, fans) where there are too many drippy people and drippy scenes and I found myself rolling my eyes. I also found the author made me feel stupid at times. I enjoyed the scenes where they were isolated together in the house though and stuck it out with the rest of the book because I wanted to find out who murdered Zack's wife. I would recommend reading some of LaVyrle Spencer's EARLIEST books if you're looking for good romance (her newer ones are beginning to take on the cornball effect, too)."
3,Ok...,"There are some romances that I've read and have fallen in love with the heroine/hero. Hmm, not so in this case. The first couple chapters showed real potential. I LOVE books that reveal the characters when they were younger. I thought to myself, this is pretty good.Then I learn more about the grown-up Julie. When she's at home, she irritates me beyond belief. She's a school teacher who teaches handicapped children. On the sidelines, she teaches illiterate women how to read. The whole town absolutely loves her, doing whatever possible, to please her. The children are always at her house playing, or doing some sort of activity. I don't know but personally, she's just way too goodie-too-shoes for my taste. I groan aloud at certain points in the book as a result of this.I understand that she's changed herself because of her past, and to please her family, but does she really have to be so 'perfect'? This is just my own taste but I perfer my heroines with way more faults."
4,One worth reading,"O.k. I guess I agree with some of the other reviews that Sandini seems to be missing from the end. However, if you consider the fact that Sandini prefers to be in the background and Zach will always be very much in the forefront, it makes sense that he's missing from Zach and Julies life at the end. The rest of the book was fantastic. It kept me interested from beginning to end. I also loved the chemistry between Julie and Zach. I read a part of this book while in a doctors waiting room and actually embarrassed myself by laughing out loud! It's one of those books that really makes you feel. Not your typical drippy romance with a quick sappy ending either. I can't wait to read some of the authors other books."
2,Not as Perfect as Almost Heaven,"I first read McNaught's work in Almost Heaven, a book that made me laugh out loud several times. This book fell far short in my eyes. I agree with other reviewers who felt Zack was too controlling and needed therapy. At the end of the novel I wanted her to refuse to take him back, because he had been such a Class A Jerk to her!"
3,Too mushy for me,"I cannot give a true review of this book because it is not my type of reading. I bought it out of desperation to read something. My preferences goes to book by these authors: Judith Michael, Penny Vincenzi, Jean M. Auel, Belva Plain, John Grisham, etc."
4,Very Good,"After finishing the book ""Paradise"" last week, I was eager to start ""Perfect"" because of the great reviews, and I was also excited to hear more about the characters Matt and Meridith that were in Paradise. I thought Perfect was a good book, but there were parts in it that seemed like they would never happen in real life - for instance, Julie was kidnapped by Zack, and after only being with him for 3 days, thinking he was a murderer, she let him take her virginity away after saving herself for 26 years? To me, in real life, that would never happen in that type of a situation. And to be in love after a week? Still, the story was very good otherwise and the characters were likeable. I was eager for them to find each other again and it was overall a good story by the end. I did get a little tired of all the real life movie stars mentioned too, that seemed kind of out of place. Anyway, it was worth the read, but I would still say ""Paradise"" is my favorite!"
4,Good Read,"This is a pretty good read and one of my favorite of Judith's novel. I do agree with the other reviewer in terms of Sandini. How come he just went missing from the pages. It seems like when the character was first introduced, it was very strong and has high impact but then just went to zero.Also it bothers me a lot that most of Judith McNaught's female leads have no sexual experience or if they do, they are portrayed as these uptight, rigid, low-self-worth women in bed. Understanding if it is a 18th century setting but the 19th or 20th century ones? C'mon..."
3,Ho hum,"When I first started reading this book, I felt that it would in fact be perfect. McNaught spent a lot of time introducing us to the main characters and developing their storyline. The way she kept switching between Zack's storyline to Julie's until eventually they met was incredible. Then it all seemed to fall apart at the seams. This 676 pg book was extremely long, extremely forced, and at times extremely unbelievable. Zack was too grumpy for my taste and Julie was too goody-goody. C'mon, a hot-shot movie star/director falling for a small-town virgin. Yeah right! And what happened to the characters that McNaught so painstakingly introduced to us? Dominic, Paul, Carl? Where are they? We never heard from them again. I don't want to give away too much of the storyline, but it seems that McNaught got bored with the book and started rushing to be finished. All in all, a good book, but definetly not ""perfect""."
3,not that good,"I am surprised at all the glowing reviews here. I stopped the book halfway through as it was getting a little contrived (Glen Close etc!). Picked it up 3 weeks later and finished it. It never grabbed me, and the I thought the writing was subpar. The heroine was too good to be true and the hero was larger than life. As another reviewer mentioned it earlier, too formulaic. I prefer her historical romances."
5,Oh Soooooo... Perfect!!!,"The title of this book is so apt- it is simply perfect! I have never come accross a more profound, deep and emotionally moving story in my life. Zach and Julie take you on their love journey and have you rooting for them every step of the way. They are made for each other and are Perfect together! Their time together in the mountains alone, is the most beautiful love story I have ever read. I read a lot of reviews where people had specifically said they liked Perfect more than Pardise, well, I will just say that although Paradise is special in itself (very special), it is not Perfect. I loved this book and it will be on my keeper shelf forever. Thank you, Judith Mcnaught, for this Perfect book!"
3,Can you say Name-Dropping?,"The story wasn't bad, but I grew tired of the constant referral to every actor known to man as being someone Zack knew. And give me a break - Barbara Streisand??? I hardly think so! I t would have been better if Ms. McNaught hadn't tried to impress us with so many famous names."
5,"If you want to escape with a ""feel good"" book, try Perfect","I've read just about everything that McNaught haswritten, and Paradise and Perfect are the two best.Although her stories about the Westmorelands were interesting..and well written....they were predictable. Not true of Perfect. This story had several underlying plots...some were, again, predicatbale....but not true of the relationship Julie and Zack. Their story was poignant, sweet and fairytale. Even if most of us will never have a fairytale romance in our lives, if you need to simply escape for a weekend and want to spend it with a captivating book....try Perfect. I'm sure you'll not be disappointed."
3,Not Everything Was Perfect,"The story started off strong, but lost stamina less than a third of the way through. Neither character was overly likeable. Zach seemed cold and Julie's character is a dime a dozen. Once the two of them got together the bickering became tedious and the flirtations were predictable.Overall, there were parts of the novel that were exciting, but as far as the romance was concerned; I didn't see the connection. The story was too far fetched. I think it would have had more potential if Zach wasn't a Hollywood Heart-throb.PARADISE and REMEMBER WHEN were much more enjoyable."
3,"Good romance, but the celebrity name-dropping was too much!","The heroine was a spunky ""good girl"", and the hero was a generic ""bad boy"", so if you enjoy that romantic formula, this book is for you. Unfortunately, the author spends an inordinate amount of time waxing poetic about Barbra Streisand, Patrick Swayze, and other celebrities who are characterized as eerily sweet and friendly when we get to meet them at the end. (Sort of like Stepford Movie Stars Come To Visit.) The celebrity sitings made this read a bit nauseating."
5,Wonderful read!,"I could not put this one down! This was my first contemporary romance novel (I've always read historical romances before now), but I decided to try it. If you read this book, you'll fall in love with the story, the characters and the steamy romance, just like I did. A must read for McNaught fans. (If you like this one, you should also try Julie Garwood. Another great romance novelist.)"
5,The best book I ever read,Perfect was the greatest book I ever read. Zack and Julie have impacted my life forever. I would just love a sequel this is one love story that should go on forever.
3,K-9 Water Bottle,I bought this bottle to fit in a homemade water bottle stand made from piping. The advertisement for the stand said this bottle would work. It continued to leak because it didn't sit correctly in the stand. The bottle itself is very sturdy; thick glass. I think it would work great attached to the outside of a dog crate with the hardware that comes with the bottle. It is also easy to clean with a bottle brush.
5,Harder Trance bordering on Techno at times but I broke it in,"I have tried very hard to accept trance knowing that it contained what I perceived to be a better form of electronica but could never find myself with headphones on listening to it for long and I think most hip hop is just terrible so I found it hard to progress, sitting around waiting for Moby or U2 to do a new album, so I pushed myself into Oakenfold, Van Dyk and then finally DJ Tiesto for a very alternative type of DJ trance that I bought into after listening to it on purpose and then with that push found myself with his whole collection and loved it, so naturally I heard that Armin Van Buuren has some good mixes, Tiesto having cut some mixes into his own Magik series, I came here, did not automatically like this Double CD at all at first but now it is very great stuff because the break beats in the mixes are very great I think. Again ""time"" is what did the trick. Get it if that is your soup."
4,Lush Trance,"This compilation is very pleasing to my ear. I loved the rolling basslines intertwined with the lovely trance samples. Lush Lush Lush. CD1 is a bit more upbeat than CD2 and features great tracks like ""Under The Sun"", which sports great spanish type strings employed by Solarstone. ""Search for Freedom"" works well on the dance floor. CD2 is more chilled and has some great rolling beats for your listening pleasure. All in all a great CD set to have in the box."
4,the true trance alliance,i love this complication of tracks ...its was long overdue and finally...no vocals. trance music is evolving everyday that people having trouble adjusting to change arent really focusing on the true meaning of trance. mainstream is engulfing up wearyheads who bite of other artists music to make millions with no feeling no sence of freedom. just mack wannabees and fake personnas. not to mention rap sheets or fights/issues with other artist/producers .in turn the fan suffers.i listen to trance and only trance.lets not forget that trance djs are working hard to send trance music to a whole new level and away from the mainstream slum ...trance well and prosper...
4,Definately Worth it.,"This was kind of my first introduction to AVB, heard him on DI a while back and bough his cd. Good Trance is hard to find these days especially if you dont like fast, drummy beats. I prefer the mellow mood this whols CD sets. You can just throw it on and listen to the whole thing without skipping tracks.Tracks blend well. If you like Tiesto you will probably enjoy his stuff, not too mainstream and not too much vocals. ""Sahara"" and ""Burned with desire"" are very hot so I will probably buy his new cd too. I rate this and Tiesto's Just Be one of the best for the year.As of now I havent really gone too much into cd #2. I agree with most listeners that this cd should be short and sweet no need for 2 cd's. I guess I have been burned alot by those 'infamous' cd #2's."
3,PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY,"The soundbites that Amazon and Armada music have provided the consumer are not good portrayals of the whole songs. A few of the songs towards the end of the first disc, ""Satellite"" and ""Burned with Desire"" as examples have some very cheesy vocals(""you are half a world away but in my mind I wisper every single word you say and before you sleep at night, you pray to me your lucky star your singing satellite""). They are so bad that I gave the album 3 stars. There are none of these vocals in the soundbites to listen to before you buy. Ha! False advertising! If you like anthemic trance, the kind you will here in a stadium or at parties, then buy this. It is very good in that regard and AVB is very good at mixing and arranging. As you listen to the first disc, it all starts to sound the same though, which is what I have always hoped I wouldn't say about trance because I enjoy it."
3,Uninspiring,"I just didn't feel the soul in most of this album. I was psyched to get it, but I feel disappointed. It isn't the hard, driving trance that I expected. In the CD insert, Armin says he's trying to get back to what he thinks are the roots, or glory days, of trance. He says he was going for a sound like old Oakenfold-type stuff-a little softer, melodic and flowy. I can hear what he's going for, but it misses the mark for the most part. CD 2 has the best stuff, I think. Track 4, Perfect Wave, is a rare example of old Oakenfold stuff rehashed. It's great. Other than that it doesn't do anything for me until we get to tracks 8 and 9, Totally Fascinated and Rise, which are both also great.I give the CD 3 stars based on just those 3 songs."
2,"OK CD, not as expected","I guess I'm more into the tracks produced by Armin Van Buuren and Ferry Corsten together on a single label rather than them individually, as in the album, Armin moves away from his traditional sounds and begin introducing something that will become evident in his most recent album, which is in the likes of Paul Van Dyke and ATBs newer albums."
3,"There's just not a lot of that hard, driving trance","There's just not a lot of that hard, driving trance that we all know and love AVB for. The only song that really grabbed me as a great dance song was track 9 on disk 2. I don't have the name in front of me, sorry. There are a few other songs with good beats, but, to me, there are a lot of songs that just don't move me and they are not the kinds of songs that will get a club moving. I'm giving it three stars, but it's BARELY 3 stars, IMO. I am dissapointed in this album but I had very high expectations."
4,"Light weight, good value","We recently took our pet turtle with us on vacation. We purchased this as a travel tank. It worked very well. It was light weight and had enough room for him (he is still rather small). We had to change the water daily as there was not room for his usual filter. All in all a good buy. However it does seem delicate. I can imagine the thin plastic cracking if handled roughly, but we treated it with care and it worked fine."
5,Awesome!!!,I use this to house bearded dragon eggs in my home made incubator. Works great as the vents allow humidity to go through with ease!
3,"Overpriced, Pretty and Underwhelmed","I purchased this years ago with the buttons and was not overwhelmed with the sound for the price. I now came back and bought this newer version, front loading for CDs. The sound is not what I would expect and I am underwhelmed once again. This clock radio with CD is attractive and the frontloading system design is the most impressive aspect of this radio. The sound is muddy and the highs are poor. For the $499 and the additional cost I incurred for the nice CD accessory, I know I will return this or feel like a fool for being taken for so much cash."
2,How about useful features,"The Bose Wave II I just bought sounds just as good as the Wave I already had, but is more annoying to use. The lack of buttons might be a great cost saver for Bose, but it's a pain in the ass for anybody who owns one, and is maybe the stupidest design idea in any product I've seen lately. My old unit has both buttons and a remote. OK, so it still costs $500, which I guess is a benefit, but it really doesn't do anything that my old unit didn't.If Bose really wants to add consumer value, instead of offering a kit that allows me to use my $500 radio as a remote wireless speaker for my computer or television, how about adding a wireless connection for remote speakers so I can hear it anywhere in the house.Grrrrrrr."
2,over rated,"I bought this product on behalf of my parents. Personally, I don't think the sound quality is worth almost $500.00. This seems more of a status symbol than genuine value for the price. But then my tastes are pretty simple."
4,Sounds great and looks good.,"I've had one of these for a while and they do have excellent sound. The price is a bit steep, but the quality is very high."
1,Don't do it!,"I bought my first Bose music system back in 2005. The sound quality was excellent, so much so that when I moved I got rid of my decades-old cd player, receiver, and speakers. Being partially deaf, I especially appreciated the option of playing the TV through the machine. Shortly after the move, that feature stopped working, so I bought a new system with a 4-cd changer and put the older one in my bedroom. Soon, that cd player began acting erratically (skipping, stopping too soon), and not long after this, the cd changer in the one in the living room stopped ejecitng. Then the same thing happened to the cd slot in the machine proper. All of this, of course, conveniently happened AFTER the warranties had expired on both machbines. So, I'm left with the two most epensive alarm clocks I ever bought.... Yes, I'm bitter, but don't waste your money on Bose!!!"
3,Bozo Radio,"I've owned my Bose radio-CD for about six or seven years, and it is the best alarm clock I ever owned. Seriously. But I've had better radios (I'm in my late 70s) that cost relatively a lot less. The celebrated Bose ""full"" sound is not all that it's cracked up to be, though you may be impressed at first. And the reception is poor. I tried an antenna. Not much improvement. I have a much cheaper radio that does much better. I live in southern Ohio, about a hundred mils from major cities. Oh, and that tiny remote that comes with it. I lost mine early on and ordered a new one, but that did not work very long. I did research and found that's not unusual. All in all, though it is solidly built and has some nice features, and is a status symbol, but it is overpriced and I would not buy another one. The alarm clock feature is what I appreciate most, but $500 for that?"
5,Whats not to Love?,"Got this for my Mother who called me and said she feels like eh's died and gone to heaven. When an 82 year old says that, having heard music in many forms from many sources is testimony of the quality of music the Bose system is capable of and sufficient for me to want one as well!"
3,Good sound but defective design,"The sound is good. The price is a little bit high. Given the price, I would expect there are some buttons on the unit so that I can operate it without a remote. But some guy at Bose think it's a 'feature' to not to have buttons on the unit. It's not a problem until you cannot find your remote. That's happened to us when one day my wife brought it with her on a trip but forgot the remote. I think bose realized this issue since newer versions now have buttons. My point is: not having buttons on the unit is a defect, not a ""feature"", as claimed by someone probably from Bose. The sound is decent. But it's never a good idea to have a system that is dead if the remote is missing or broken."
5,Bose Radio,"new approach with all controls on the remote, none on the radio. I find it quite convenient. Quality is very good and I particularly like getting away from black units"
2,one word: Annoying,"f*cking annoying. There are _NO_ controls on the radio itself, you _HAVE_ to use the remote. Your remote battery died? too bad, the radio is completely nonfunctional without the remote (can't even turn it on/off). Also, aux-in is a headphone jack instead of the standard red and white on all stereos, you you have to buy a special (headphone plug on both sides)cable to hook up a computer or ipod to it."
4,Just A Radio to Me,This was a Christmas gift for the wife... its what she wanted. Its just another radio to me with a high price. I can not tell the good part..yet..must be my ears. I hope it works good and last a long time but only time will tell. It did get here fast.
1,disposable stereo..,"A friend owns this ""system"" and the CD player was skipping. He took it in for service and the tech wouldn't touch it saying ""replace it"", it's disposable stereo. Bose spends millions advertising this hunk of plastic knowing full well that the majority of purchasers don't really understand how little they are getting for their money. For $500 you can do a whole lot better folks. Friends don't let friends buy Bose."
1,A TRUE LIGHT WEIGHT PIECE OF JUNK,"Check your local dollar store first before buying this attachment here...At $17.47 you get ""much less"" than what you paid for...1/ Output shaft moves/wobbles from side to side...2/ Don't force this tool, small holes only with very light pressure...3/ Don't run at high speed....4/ Forget about drilling steel...5/ Expect it to fail...General Tools 924 Right Angle Driveat $19.99 might be a better choiceor at $19.29 theVermont American 17171 Angle Drills"
2,you get what you pay for,"This thing broke the second time I used it. Chipped a tooth, no way I can reasonably fix it. Cheap junk."
5,Do Get This Single!,"I not much of a single's buyer, but I have to say this is a great one. Just get it to hear the song Knew Enough To Know Nothing At All; I wish they had included it on the original album. Plus very cool version of Dancing In The Dark. Get it if you are a fan of Yorn!"
4,It's as good now as it was 10 years ago,"This song was a breakthrough hit of sorts for Yorn back in 2001. If you remember it, you'll be glad to learn it's aged pretty well, though lots of bands have a similar sound now, so it's not quite as fresh. If you don't remember it, well, it's a poppy little song about love and regret, with enough grit to give it some grip. I say give it a shot, especially if you can grab it for the low, low price of $0."
5,A really rich description and a great translation,This book offers a magnificent description of river life in rural Bengal. The translator captures the ethosand the nuances of the original to a great extent. The novelmakes the rural setting of half a century past come alivewith the use of flowing metaphors. A delightful read.
1,THIS BOOK WAS THE MOST THE MOST BOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRING BOOK,"I read this book and it was the most horrible book eva. Like eva. OMG it was, like, eva, da most boringest book eva. Like eva! Not eva as in ever, but my friend Eva who is like da most boringest book like eva! Like so eva that like you 'd be board like fo eva. Li so don't buy dis buk unless you board like board games. There are much better ways of entertainment like videogames and television. Plop of you kooshie couch and watch the latest pokemon movie!!! Or AUstin Powers!!! Shagadlic!"
1,Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring,"this book is horrible. my teacher makes me read it and analyze it and i'm only 13! actually this book is pretty good, there i go again, contradicting myself contrary to popular belief. lol. ahhh... this book is quite good except for the fact that we have to analyze it and take notecards on a lot of motivations n stuff. but i would never read it in my spare time. i would much rather read about george w. bush and his loony antics. boy are we lucky we have a smart pm here in da UnItEd KiNgDoM which is a wicked country! UNION JACK POWER! go wills, go harry, go keanu, go ian, go christopher, go jamie, go phillip... BRITS AND AUSSIES AND CANADIANS ROCK! notice that none of these people are from the US..."
1,ICKY,"This was the absolute worst book I think I have ever read! I am not kidding one bit! It will bore you to death. It literally almost did kill me (long story). I swear to god though, you will have no idea what the hell is going on in this book. Here is an excert from the book:""We hear the Kayasthas come to your home to practice tabla-playing, and to eye your daughters. Think of this--- you mixing with the Kayasthas will not confer on you the rank of the Kayastha.""WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?? And thats the first time in the whole book they even mention these ""Kayasthas"". This book is impossible to follow!"
1,BLEGGHHH!,"EWWWWWW! This book was soooooo BARFOLICIOUS! how do expect a f***** seventh grader to understand this?! Don't read it. it's the most confusing book i've ever read. if you actually want to read it, you're insane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I FELL ASLEEP WHILE REEDING THIS BOOK SEVEN TIMES,THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN! IT'S PLAIN BORING AND NOT A BOOK SOMEONE IN SEVENTH GRADE SHOULD BE READING. THIS IS A HORRIBLE BOOK AND NO ONE SHOULD EVER READ IT EVEN AGAIN! I MEAN WHO WHOULDN'T FALL ASLEEP WHEN THE BOOK IS ABOOUT A STIPID RIVER THAT DOESN'T EVEN SHOW UP ON MAPS! IF YOU READ THIS BOOK YOU WILL BE INSANE!
2,NCstar 1x42...mehh,"Picked up this up to use for my GSG-522 but decided to use another optic instead. Then since it was lying around, figured I throw it on a Marlin 30-30 that was passed down to me. All I can say is that after one round, it wouldn't hold zero any more. If you do plan on getting this for a rifle, make sure it's for a .22lr or airsoft. Don't waste your time with this if you want to mount it on something with some recoil."
3,Not for an RWS Diana 34,"The sight started out working very well. The sight was clear, with a sharp point and a nice field of view.Once sighted in, it was helping me hold a 3/8"" group @ 10 meters with Beeman 14.66g domed pellets.The adjustments were not as sharp and crisp as an expensive scope, but hey, you get what you pay for.It was rated for a crossbow or spring-type air rifle and that is the reason I bought it.I did not realize that the RWS Diana 34, a spring-type air gun, was more violent than most.After 300-400 shots, the sight died and will not hold a pattern.I liked how it behaved, right up until the end, where my ""normal"" use I killed it.Triv"
3,Not for use with high powered rifles.,I think mine was defective because I had to keep on retightening the clamps for the weaver mount every time I shot with my nitro piston bb gun. The red dot did not line up in the middle either. No matter how hard I cranked the knobs it wouldn't reach the center. This looks like a very nice product but watch out for the defects. I didn't send mine back because it makes a very nice spotting scope and the batteries that are included work with my smaller red dot sight.
5,A Really Great Product,"I use this product on an Airsoft AEG. Initially I bought it because it looked cool on the gun and the price of the product was fantastic.The fit and finish of this thing is simply awesome. It is all metal with a flat black finish. It feels substantial (not some plastic toy). It comes with two batteries, one installed and another packed with the sight.When I first got the thing, I was playing with it to figure out the dials and mounts. I put back in the box, and by mistake, I left it on. Two days later I opened it to mount it on the AEG and it was still working. That weekend, I played an Airsoft game (all day) using the sight with the same battery. It was hot and humid on the field and this thing never fogged. I cannot say the same for my stupid goggles.In bright light and low light, this thing works great. Make sure you mount it high. Either on the rail mount riser platform, or on top of the carry handle (if you are using an M4)."
2,Does not fit the Carver One paintball gun,It does not fit the carver one paintball gun. But if I had a different gun it would have been a really good sight. I like how they added the lenses that make like binoculars. :o
1,Does not work -- do not buy,"The Netgear XE102GNA Wall-Plugged ethernet extenders (I bought a pair) never worked for me. I wasted four hours on this supposedly plug-and-play device. The devices did not work ""out of the box"" at all. I googled the internet for ideas and tried them. No luck."
5,These work great!,"I wish I had learned about these sooner, before wasting fifty dollars on a USB wireless adapter which dropped the internet connection at least five times a night. With these powerline adapters we have no troubles whatsoever. We have them plugged into several rooms in our house and they work great. We have the 103 connected to our router and the 104 in another room and they all work fine together."
1,Junk. Don't buy.,"Bought this product based on very favorable customer reviews. My experience was totally different. I couldn't get the product to work at all, even after spending much time on the phone with tech support. I'm very disappointed."
1,Am I missing something?,"Purchased this item for on-line play with my XBox 360 based on lots of positive feedback from others, but I haven't had the same experience. Connected everything as instructed, both wall units light up as they should, but I get an error message when trying to access XBox Live. Called NetGear tech support, but the guy I spoke with had difficulty with English and was rather condescending (at least the bits and pieces I could understand). Really disappointed."
4,Great product!,"This product works much better than the USB wireless device we used to have! The USB device worked for about 3 months and then quit. This is much faster with no interference from any other electronics (microwaves, cordless phones, etc.). We really like this product!"
1,Netgear XE102G wall plugged ethernet extender,"sadly for me this did not work and I sent it back,I replaced it with a different make and hey-presto NO PROBLEM !!!"
2,Basic But Not Beautiful,"This book is just cold hard facts and nothing else. If that is what you are looking for, then buy this book by all means. But if you want an inside look at the schools go elsewhere."
4,An Ode to the Random,"Random hilarity abounds, and for once the title doesn't say it all - in fact, it only scratches the surface.Yes, we do indeed have whales on stilts here. We also have laser beams, rocket cars, secret labs in abandoned warehouses, robots, phonographs, eight-page footnotes, grannies with ribbon candy, a plot to overthrow the world, adventurous girls and boys, uncooperative hairstyles, and a short quiz at the end.And that's not even giving much away.In other words, for a book you can read in a little over an hour, it's good, weird fun! Dig in and enjoy!"
1,Whales on Stilts,"I bought this book for my 8 year old son. The story had a very odd premise andalthough it tried hard to be wryly funny at times, my son just found it weird, as did I."
4,Whales on Stilts - wacky adventure,I had to read this book for myself after my eleven year old son was reading it and laughing through the entire thing. I found the book amusing and interesting. Perfect for my son and his age group. Parts in the story were educational. I enjoyed it and we are waiting for the next book to come out in August.
5,Real fun,"I am giving this book five stars because it made me smile and laugh so much, so often. Kids around grade 4 (and up) will love its irreverence, as Anderson skillfully skewers common conventions of kid lit, television, advertising, and all the other stupid stuff which kids today must daily ingest. (The skewering is done in such a fun-loving, cheerful way that it doesn't come across as mean or nasty.) In doing this kind of intelligent parody, Anderson treats the young reader with great respect. Some kids know they are being fed formulaic stuff a lot, and this daffy spree is a welcome antidote. The plot? Absurd as can be. The characters? Ridiculous. The structure? Deliberately outlandish. I think I laughed hardest at the ""questions for discussion"" at the end - anyone who's ever had to take a standardized test will love it. In short, Anderson goes straight to a kid's funny bone, and a fun read it is."
3,Not what I thought,"I was searching under ""books"" for something on sign language for Hispanics, so when this came up I assumed it was a book. My fault for assuming -- I should have looked more carefully, but I was in a hurry. Anyway, I bought this for an inmate, who unfortunately does not have access to a computer, so it's pretty much useless to me."
4,El mejor pianista de México,"Este disco compacto, a pesar de su elevado costo en comparación con propuestas similares y el deficiente sonido, ofrece una excelente ejecución de la tercera sonata de Brahms y una conmovedora e íntima interpretación de las Fantasías para piano.Conozco esta sonata interpretada por Arthur Rubinstein, la cual es muy intensa y dramática. La de Osorio no se queda atrás, pero queda opacada por la grabación que en ocasiones (especialmente en las Fantasías), deja escuchar el golpeteo de los martillos sobre las cuerdas del piano en lugar de la nota clara, haciéndola incómoda de escuchar.Sin embargo, vale la pena tener este disco tan dificil de conseguir. Muy recomendado para coleccionistas y seguidores de este pianista extraordinario. Es una pena la mala distribución de Artek, así como la dificultad de encontrar la legendaria grabación que de las Baladas Op 10 de Brahms hiciera Osorio en ASV, las cuales solo escuché en una ocasión.¡Cómprenlo!"
1,Label Very Misleading.,"Although I enjoyed this DVD very much, I gave it a low rating because unbeknownst to me it's the exact same one I ordered earlier this year! I ordered this one because of the 2008 year, mine is 2010. Although I expected a few of the shows to be the same as mine I didn't expect the exact same DVD with a different label. The only benefit to my wasting my money on something I already have is that I can give this one to my best friend as an additional Christmas gift."
1,Where's the PARENTAL ADVISORY?,"I thought this was a compilation in & of itself, but it's a series of episodes from a ""gameshow bloopers"" TV show. Never saw it.About 60 seconds into this DVD you'd think'd be ""family fare"", you get a British game show where the host asks a contestant, ""Which one of your fellow contestants has had sex in front of fifty people?"" Later installments of this same show have the ""F"" word bleeped, but clearly discernible. One segment has contestants ""downing a shot of your own urine"". Later, eating lambs' testicles.If you want ""classic"" game show moments, this is =NOT= the DVD."
1,Worst ever,Worst DVD I've ever bought in my life. Seems that all DVDs about bloopers are just a big horrible joke. This one fits in just right. Dont buy or waste money.
2,Game show moments,"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this dvd. After the second episode, it became predictable and boring. The episodes just seem to drag on and on. I will not purchase anything similar to this dvd in the near future."
4,definitely got my $$$ worth,"i got in on this when it was $14.95.my comforter is plenty fluffy & there is no cord as per the picture. didnt expect a cord trim.the jacquard print & material is really pretty.the bed skirt is low quality solid cream color, but, again, for the price of less than $15.oo, people, its a great deal!the shams add a nice air of sophistocation to this value set.i also ordered yellow 'dobby dot' sheet set & it looks really lush together!!! im happy, very happy!"
3,Quality vs Price,"As per amazon, original price is $300. I dont think anyone would buy it even at half price (i.e. $150). I got mine at ~$15.00 and this is not bad at this price. So basically if you compare its Quality vs Price, then I think its very good and its hard to find at this price. I my experience, I haven't seen this price even at closing stores for this quality of Comforter. I have noticed that Amazon is changing price for this item day to day, If you current price above $25, pass it otherwise its a good buy."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,THIS IS A BOTTOM OF THE LINE COMFORTER. THE DUST RUFFLE IS NOT STRIPED AS IN THE PICTURE IT IS BEIGE AND THE CONSISTENCY OF A THIN SHEET. THERE IS NO GOLD BRAID ON THE EDGE OF THE COMFORTER JUST A SEAM. THIS COMFORTER IS POSSIBLY WORTH $40 BUT NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD PAY $300. IF YOU WANT A GOOD QUALITY COMFORTER THIS IS NOT IT! IT IS ALSO NOT OVER STUFFED BUT VERY THIN.
2,Bottom quality,I just got this comforter set and it does not look like the picture at all. There is no cord trim along the comforter like the picture. The bedskirt is a bottom line quality. The set would worth about $30 max. The comforter is very thin too.
2,comforter set,"The inside of the comforter is cream color and not striped. The bedskirt is also cream color and not striped. It is very flimsy, and I was very disapointed with the quality. I love the colors but it has been very difficult to find a matching bedskirt with similiar colors."
2,"Westpoint Stevens Patrician Woven Jacquard Queen Comforter Set, Frederica",I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased two of these comforter sets - then I wouldn't have purchased. My thoughts were if it originally sold for $300 it had to be good. Very dissappointed with the bedskirt - I hate that paper stuff on the bedskirt and not even full/ruffled or pleated and the beige color just looks like a sheet hanging below the comforter. No cording on the comforter and no striped bedskirt like picture that comes with the comforter in package. Only thing I can say about it is that is comes in a nice zippered plastic storage contaner.
4,Very nice and great looking conforter set,Nice. A very practical set. Normally you would pay extra forshams and skirt but they are included in this set for the price of just the conforter.
1,Flimsy and worthless,"Very disappointed with this and every other product I have purchased from Westpoint. I won't even be using these for the guest rooms. Honestly, I wouldn't even let my dog use these. Their products are inferior garbage right out of the package.Personally, my advise is to AVOID any purchases from Westpoint."
4,good for the basics,"I bought the Guide as a requirement for becoming a writing tutor at my university. It's pretty short so I was able to read it in one afternoon. I'd say this is a good basic tool for every tutor. I never got around to completing the exercises but they seemed pretty helpful, if you have the time. However, if you're looking for anything in-depth and detailed, you might want to look elsewhere. Like I said, this is great for learning the basic techniques for tutoring and to brush up on your skills. It's easy to follow and pretty helpful."
5,excellent exercises,"I am rewriting the training manual for our Writing Center Peer Tutors, depending very heavily on the excellent exercises included in this text. There is very little literature out there on the training of peer tutors, making this text very valuable."
4,interesting book,I ordered this book after checking it out from the public library. The author teaches the importance of paying attention to our digestive system and many health related problems that occur when we don't.
3,Shaggy Again,"It would appear that I have a copy of this CD under a different cover, tilted Mr. Lover Lover (The Best of Shaggy Part 1). I was very disappointed about that. Oh well now I have 2 copies."
3,Metal polish,"No better than products such as Goddard's and Hagerty's as silver polish with tarnish inhibitors, but useful as an alternative to Brasso as brass, copper and pewter cleaner. Expensive."
2,MAAS Creme Metal Polish 4 Oz Tube,"Does a decent job, but is very hard to use. Not user friendly, my arm and hand were sore afer scrubing and I do mean scrubing my stainless steal sink."
5,SHINE ON,MAAS polish is the ultimate in polishing anything from sterling silver to gold. I have been a faithful user for over 20 years. I met the woman who developed it in Europe and brought it here to the States. If you have not tried it - DO!
4,Silver shines!,"My silver, copper and brass shines forever. Tube is easy to use and doesn't dry out like the jar or bottle products."
5,Lovely and mystical,"I am enamoured with most everything Rylant writes and will buy her books just because she wrote them. This story reads like a prose poem -- her language is spare and beautiful. Mysteries abound and heart wrenching surprises arrive in small phrases without pretense. The imagery and characters are unforgettable. Daniel has such a feminine side, shielded from the media saturated mainland. His loneliness and sense of ""different-ness"" will resonate with everyone."
3,Gifts from the Sea,"This little gem can be read in one fascinating sitting; in fact, it just begs to be read aloud. But read this one slowly--to savor the salty smell of the ocean off British Canada and tolisten to the crashing surf and wheeling seagulls. One must look intently to notice the glistening droplets on a magical gift from the sea.Ten-year-old Daniel, an orphan from the mainland, lives on a rustic islet with his taciturn Grandfather. They boy longs for companions his own age, but must rely on his ingenuity, compassion for living things and his affinity with Nature to provide stimulation for the lonely hours. Yet such primitive conditions (no TV, phones or even horses) are ideal toinspire keen observations along the shoreline. When he spies a mermaid's comb--obvious at first glance that such it is--his drab existence is changed forever. This is a wonderful book of fantasy and personal growth to share with kids, from 7-70!"
4,"""The Islander"" is a good read-aloud","I am a teacher and I read this book out loud to my students, after first reading it myself, last November. All of my students loved it and patiently waited every day for the next chapter or two. We don't live near an ocean, but it was not hard to imagine the sights and sounds, since they were so vividly described in the book. This is not the best book of 1998, but it definitely deserves some recognition. It was a good read and was interesting."
4,The Islander,"This story is about a boy who is living on an island with his grandfather because his parents died in a tragic plane crash. Since then he is very lonely on the island and doesn't have any friends. One day he was walking along the beach when he came upon a sea otter. The sea otter left the boy with a special gift, a gift that will change the future and his life forever. I rate this book a four because its exiting and it keeps me reading. I recommend this book to anyone of any age."
1,Not really a troubleshooting book,"I bought this book because the name was appealing and I thought it would be useful for my job on a help desk. There are more pictures than real information and I've found much better troubleshooting tips on newsgroups and in other books. The concept of this book is good and I want to like it, but it just doesn't deliver. Perhaps it would be useful for someone with little Microsoft Office experience."
3,"Bizarre, but enjoyable","Amazing how everyone's perceptions of films are different. And thankfully so, otherwise we would never get mixed reviews.Perfect Strangers is an interesting, yet bizarre film about a lonely man (Neill) who apparently lives on a deserted island. One evening he picks up a lady (Blakely) from the mainland and before she knows it, has been kidnapped back to this remote location. The film is of course much more than this. The film explores Blakely's disappointment with her own life and we then see a total turnaround in her character. My interpretation of the film is that loneliness can make people do things that normally wouldn't. Definitely not the boring film that other reviewers have stated. Worth seeing, and for the beautiful scenery too."
3,Kinda Boring,"A drunk lady finds herself captive to a total stranger on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere and starts to assume he is a little ""cookoo"".When a sudden change in events happen, and the young lady finds herself in controll of the matter, her life changes from what it used to be, to a maddening life of love and passion for the stranger.But when the young maiden finds herself now torn between her passionate love for the stranger, and yet another man who claims to be the owner of the house upon which the man and woman are now peacfully living in, things start to get a little confusing."
3,Unexpected Plusses,"Like many, I turned to this film expecting to enjoy anotherworthy Sam Neill performance. However, he was really beside the point in this understated role. The best things this film has going for it are the soundtrack (too bad it's not available) and the New Zealand landscape in which it was shot."
2,"Not one for....well, anbody","This story is interesting. I did like the storyline up to the point where the guy was frozen in his tracks and started appearing everywhere. The cinimatography of this movie is very bad. It might have been good about 10 years ago. The sound quality is absolutely terrible, but I did like the main tune theme thing.I live really close to the places that this movie was shot (Here on the West Coast of New Zealand!), and the only reason I went to see this movie was because I wanted to see my town on screen.I went to the South Island Premier and met Gaylene Preston, I can see why the movie is strange...considering she was wearing some badly knitted top and a red possum over her neck. lol.Anyway, I give this movie 2 starts because the story strays from the normal cliched story you see in many Hollywood movies today...The storyline was strange, but enjoyable....if only someone else directed it."
4,strangely compelling,"This movie wasn't what I expected or even wanted. However, it was compelling and interesting to watch. I didn't like where the plot ended up going, but hey, I didn't write the script and just because I like happy endings is no reason to criticize an otherwise well done movie. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. Not the best movie out there, but I'd recommend it."
4,"A comedy about divorce, finding yourself and the bond between a father and son. Unexpectedly funny and touching. I say B.","A movie about divorce, realizing what is important and the bond between a father and son. After his wife (Moss) leaves Dr. Bingham (Grant) he goes into a deep depression. With help from his son Dr. Bingham changes his image and starts dating again and seems happy. When his son falls in love he puts his plans on hold and helps his son, and learns more about his wife in the process. This movie is really funny and unexpectedly touching in parts. Dr. Bingham thinks only of himself until his son falls in love and then the bond between him and his son starts to grow and it is fun to watch how they interact with each other. This movie was very surprising one of the funniest movies that has come out in the last few months. I give it a B."
2,Outdated and shallow,"Not particularly useful, even if you're only using Logic 4.x.If you're confused [as I was] about Logic, then it's most likely because you don't understand the ""environment."" This text does little to clarify this and other aspects of Logic and covers only the most basic material, i.e., setup, basic midi, etc. The best advice I'd ever give regarding Logic is that one must try to forget all he knows about other composition applications, particularly if you're coming from Protools or Digital Performer. Logic behaves like a polar opposite to most other sequencers which can be really frustrating so if you're going to tackle this mountain [and I highly recommend it!] you must not expect it to behave as though it were made by Digidesign.Also, don't expect anything from this book, it's just another thing to adorn your pile of music gear you don't use...everybody's got one, hehe.2/5"
2,"Outdated, simplistic","There's not much more to say than just those two words. It's about as interactive as a encyclopedia, but terribly limited in scope. Don't waste your money."
4,Dos Passos shines,"Superb writing by Dos Passos as he puts you in the mind of an artist trying to cope with life in the military. He wrote this in 1919 and his service in World War 1 was still burning fresh in his mind. The plot drags a little about 2/3 through but stick with it, there is a strong finish."
3,Not as much about war as the title would have you believe...,"This book is not so much about the First World War(most of the book takes place after the armistice) as about the boredom that is inflicted on soldiers to make them a unit. Even that isn't given in explicit detail, and without this level of detail the rest of the book just falls flat.Also this book has many footnotes which unfortunately are included at the back of the book instead of at the bottom of each page. It makes for continual flipping back and forth and a most irritating reading experience."
2,NOT SILENT,I bought this fan for a little bit of silence and it was just as loud as the retail version that came with the chip. The size of the fan was a little smaller so I kept it but if you are looking for a few less decibels then get a new case.
2,Heavily Edited.,"I remember seeing this comedy special when it first aired in 1996 and I absolutely loved it. I was even more excited when I saw that it was coming out on DVD because my VHS copy broke. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when I bought the DVD. There are at least 30 minutes of Sinbad's performance that are edited out. I knew something was wrong when the screen would fade to black for a second and then cut back to the show. I don't know why they do this, but it really ruins the DVD. I will never put this DVD in my player again because they cut out some of my favorite parts. I probably shouldn't complain because the price is so low, but I would rather pay more and have the whole show."
3,"Decent, but too short","Sinbad: Son of a Preacher ManSinbad is a great comedian and I'm glad they finally release more of his stand-up. Unfortunately, just like in the HBO special there are blank spaces for the commercial breaks and there seems to be a gap in routine, as though some of the routine was cut out. It only runs about 35 minutes (when you don't count the credits and opening producer advertising) so it's relatively short. I would advise you to rent it before you spend $15 with shipping an handling."
2,discourgaed,"I was expecting the part where Sinbad sings ""Have You Seen Her"" by the Chilites while holding the big radio on his shoulder. Also, there was a about 3 or 4 guys singing back - up...but to no avail!!!!I even bought Nothing but the Funk but no ""Have You Seen Her"" in this video,also. Was this segment taken out of the DVD?Please reply. Thank you."
2,Where's the rest?,"I LOVE Sinbad. I'm glad to see his comedy specials making it to DVD, but WHY ALL THE EDITING? I still have Brain Damaged and Afros and Bellbottoms from when I taped them off HBO, back when they originally aired. Why Brain Damaged hasn't made it to DVD, I don't know. It's the best. Afros and Bellbottoms is a close second. I bought that DVD and it's heavily edited, too. By that, I mean that a lot of the original content is missing. Why do they do this? Maybe it's so they can sell the full version later on. I hope so. I'd bite at that marketing ploy. I just want the WHOLE THING, regardless of what I have to pay for it. Specific to this special (Son of a Preacher Man), it's funny, but nowhere near as good as the other two I mentioned."
2,It isn't all there,"I, like other reviewers here, remember this masterpiece from the past on cable tv. Who can imagine the reasons for the makers of it to chop the original, complete broadcast all up. It is a very BIG disappointment for that reason alone, the performance is about as good as anyone could ever do, and perhaps the very best got cut.For someone who does not remember what it was, it still very odd how it fades out and back in without continuity. Probably just created a black market, underground distribution for the original with this release."
2,Classic stand up comedy. HORRIBLE DVD,I bought this recently and I was so angry at what I seen. They cut out half of sinbads performance. And why?! This is a dvd they can jam pack it with all sorts of things. I should have known something was wrong by how light the dvd was. It's unfortunate that such a great performance was ruined by this medicore dvd. I urge anybody not to buy this just out of protest. I'm just so speechless. Until they put the whole performance on here nobody should buy this.
2,Can't recommend this one.,"I bought this one on Amazon along with Sinbad's Afros and Bell Bottoms DVD.Having just calmed down after laughing hysterically throughout that DVD, I fired up Son of a Preacher Man and was very disappointed.The material seemed good but maybe Sinbad's delivery was off. Or maybe because the crowd was not connecting. Or maybe it was the terrible editing.It was because of these factors that I could not really get into this DVD.I recommend to rent or borrow this DVD only."
1,Unwatchable dreck,Everything about this DVD is appalling. It looks like an out of focus video transfer which makes your eyes hurt. And the film itself is unwatchable amatuerish dreck. Avoid this at any cost and ignore the marketing b.s. used to sell this garbage.
2,Last but definately least!,"About a month ago I was told there was a third book about Dreampark that wasn't available in Europe. Of course, I had to buy it.However, when you first read Dreampark and it's superb sequel The Barsoom Project, this installment stinks. It's just more of the same, but without the catchy twists and new insights. Also, the characters are much flatter and stay that way. And what's more, Niven and Barnes copy parts of the Pink Panther movies for suspense, for ifni's sake!The premises of the story add nothing new to the genre. It's basically about a kind of Star Trek holodeck simulation in a natural environment. The other technical theme is a massive 'Big Brother Is Watching You' computer system, which they named ScanNet (does SkyNet ring a bell?).Niven and Barnes can do, and have done, much better. I'm sorry I bought this. If you can, read it from a library instead of throwing away your money."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the SkinMedica TNS LipPlump System 2 x 0.06, considering how expensive it was.I had no noticeable difference after one month of use. Also the first tube is completely finished. That was sooner than I expected.It was a waste of money and I would not recommend it."
1,Susan A.,I have purchased this product over the last several years and been happy with it. This time the tube stopped working within a week or two of it's first use. I don't know if the tube is jammed or empty but I am not getting any product. Not happy.
4,Hope springs eternal,"This is fun reading. If your idea of a good book is that it weigh 10 lbs and makes you feel miserable, then this is not the book for you. The stories of Alexander Botts are short, funny, and always have a happy ending, despite the absolutely horrific conditions in the middle of each story. These are stories of hope, that no matter how bad things seem to be, there is always a silver lining for those who don't give up. Alexander claims he's a ""Natural Born Salesman""...I'd quibble with that and claim he's a natural born optimist. More than just a ""glass half full"" attitude, more of a ""there are thousands of uses for crushed glass"" optimism. Enjoy."
5,best book on market timing,"I really like the book but after reading it you feel as you don't know what to do right away on the markets: no strict emphasis on practical trading.A must buy, waiting for a new hands-on title by Mrs D. Weir, check her great listmania"
4,Lcsmith,"This one's so interesting it's a bit scary goes to show you how much study has been done to control the heard, charts on death rates and the economy, birth rates, divorces on and on even how we like women to look during good times and bad.Nothing here on short term trading but the guys your trading against know what color your toothbrush is.And they do want your your childs college money just in case you don't really realize that yet.To be honest I haven't finished this yet but I did skim through it It's a long read ....Good book for presidential cycle holds.Debra is simply amazing what she must know"
2,Such a stale sound,"I admit i'm not a huge QR fan, but I love the songs Metal Health and Come On Feel The Noise. From the moment I pressed play it had this terrible sound that seemed like an unrealistic live sound, the guitar wasnt trebled enough, the drum sounded flat like the treble was all the way down and the bass is hardly hearable at all. The singing however is OK.The producation on the songs really make it hard to stand out as a recignisable live album. I thought the first few songs where just boring me but then when the ones started that I knew I could hear the low quality of them, and the editing and panning sounds rotating around is just annoying. The drum solo probably would sound ok if it didnt sound trapped behind a concrete wall. I've heard better live recordings from this band then this... if youre a die hard QR fan and wanna hear some old live recordings and a few demo tracks of early songs then this album is a must but to the casual fan, skip it and go for something else by them."
3,Good Motocross Movie,It was a long time since I had first seen this movie and have been looking for it ever since. The action of the motocross was very good. The stunts exceeded my expectations would recommend.
5,CLASSIC,"Totally awesome, This movie is a classic from the 80's. So glad to see it on DVD. Great story along with great racing action, plus some HOT WOMEN!!!"
1,cheesy/lame movie,"this movie is very lame. it is so old fashioned (well its from the 80's),the acting is horrible. I got it for my kids to watch because they love dirt bikes. I had to turn the movie off about 25 minutes into the movie because there is a hotel scene between a girl and guy! It starts out with a girl in a slinky bikini too! Definately not for young viewers! I would NOT recommend this movie to the young or old; the first 25 min were horrible, couldn't even watch anymore."
5,Enjoyed Burner,I had not heard of this author before but liked the synopsis so I bought it. It took me a while to get into the book but by around page 20 I was totally hooked. The character development was great. The Artificial intelligence was so real it even made me cry. A great read and I hope he writes a sequel SOON as I want to know more about what happens to the characters and the Artificial Intelligence.
1,Poor Quality and $10 for shipping!!!,The item is very POOR quality. My guess is it is home made. The worst part is they charged over $10 for shipping a 3 OZ item in a regular envelope! What a rip off!!!
5,Great Card,Well bid farewell to 3DFX. I bought this card after my wife and I saw what kind of graphics the 810 chipset produces (horrible). I installed it in about 8 mins. The drivers had no conflict at all. I was going to get the voodoo 5500 but the compaq case wouldn't allow it. I am very pleased when I play simulators on it. I don't know how Unreal tournement plays or Quake III but the image quality is superb on all my sims. It is better then the nvidia geforce 2mx based cards. We all know that nvidia has bought out 3dfx I just hope they keep making this card! Buy it if you can find it.
1,"sorry, NO GOOD","In all honesty, I have nothing good to say about this bracelet. I never, EVER saw pewter that would bend so easily and literally split into. The packaging was less than adequate and it arrived damaged. I tried to straighten it, and it just fell apart in my hand.I won't purchase again and can't say I recommend."
2,Nit happy,The battery did not hold up very and I had to buy one from a different company I guess you get what you pay for
1,Expired!,"I threw away the box and then my printer notified me that this ink is expired. Cyan is printing terrible. Beware.UPDATE: Checked the cartridge, and it expired July 5, 2009. What a rip off!"
5,Poetic romp through make believe berry land,"My first grader still enjoys this book. He follows the illustrations very well, with the sense of ""what's coming next?"" Littler children (much littler) are just enthralled by the book. The language is so appealing. Made up words and wonderful cadence take this boy on a berry-picking adventure with a bear over a waterfall, through strawberry fields, on the trackberry with the blackberry train, and into raspberry fair.Simply wonderful -- we have read this many, many times."
3,Kids Love It... Some Adults Find It Insipid,"I have a slightly contrary view of this book to many other reviewers.Let's start with the important part. My 21-month old daughter loves it. She loves the whimsical illustrations of the boy, bear, and other animals in various berry-ful settings. She loves the fanciful rhymes and alliteration. And she certainly loves berries!But I confess that when she pulls this one out of the basket to read, my heart sinks just a bit. It's a bit too cute for me, with its ""clickety clackety pick me a blackberry"" style. So I read it... but I find myself wishing she had picked something a little less treacle-y."
1,Too off the wall for me,"I read of all of the reviews and it sounded good. However, after...reading it, I realized that it was a little too fanciful for me. I don't mind a made up word or two but we're trying to teach our kids words and there are too many fanciful things ""shoeberry, moonberry, cloudberry, trainberry, zoomberry raspberry rabbits, etc."" Yes... I'll admit that there are some Dr. Seuss books that I don't like for the same reason. It started out cute and the illustrations are warm and friendly but as a teaching tool it rates really low with me. I'll be returning it."
3,Colorful Illustrations,"I love the friendly looking bear and his crazy antics, but beyond the whimsical illustrations there isn't much to this book. Simple text but the illustrations are the best part of the book."
1,no love from our book lover!,"My son is 18 months old and LOVES books. He seems to have an insatiable desire for books. I was disappointed by the ""busy"" illustrations and awkward reading. This is the only book we own that doesn't hold his interest at all."
5,My toddler twins LOVE this book!,"I have to admit that when I first read this book, I wasn't too sure what I thought of it. As another reviewer said, it contains a lot of fanciful words: jamberry, moonberry, berryband, and so forth. My twins absolutely LOVE this book, though! To them, it's every bit as good as their favorite Dr. Seuss classic. They enjoy the rhyme and repetition of the words, and love to look through the beautifully illustrated pages to find things they recognize. We have a lot of books, and this is the one that they will ask me to read every day (sometimes more than once). We've nearly worn out one board book by reading and rereading it, so I'm going to buy another for them soon. I highly recommend this book for your toddler!"
5,A real language-developer!,"I have a 4-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son. This book has been the favorite of both. They began to choose it as very small children, and then they began to ""read"" it along with me, word for word! (And some of the words are quite challenging.) I believe it has helped them with language development, and I know it has contributed to their love of reading. If you're only going to buy one book for your toddler, make it this one."
5,Berry Berry Good!!!,This book is my 2 year old's favorite book. The rhyme and wording brings my daughter into a trancelike state. She loves it.
4,Jamberry,"This is a book i would read to and listen along to with my children in the late 80s and early 90s. I was very happy to come across it while searching amazon. But, instead of a cassette tape to read and sing along to, it's now on cd. I surprised my 22 yr. old daughter with it as a gift. And someday, she will be able to share it with her kids."
5,Great book for bed time,"Rich, colorful, fun pictures! My 4 year old loves the rhymes and memorized them quickly. Imaginative and silly. I've been readthing this one every night for 3 weeks because my daughter can't get enough."
5,This is the best!!!,"If you have small children, this book is a must! This is the sweetest story, best rhyme, lovely illustration ever! I love this book. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy every time I read it!"
5,Grows with your child,"Beautiful book that grows with your child. I bought this for my then 18 month old who loved it for the cadence and bears. But now that she's 2, she loves to repeat her favorite lines before eating berries, ""raspberry, jazzberry, razzamatazberry."" The illustrations are detailed so there are many activities and animals to point out as your child grows and their vocabulary expands. This week she has requested that we count all the blueberries, blackberries and raspberries on the last page. There are 30+ of each so be prepared to be counting for a while."
3,Pleasant Story,"This is a pleasant picture book about a girl who wants a pony for her birthday. Instead, her parents buy her a goldfish. While taking the goldfish to the park, she ends up liking the goldfish. Enjoyable, but also predictable."
5,Great mouse pad for optical mouse,"Cute, flat, works very well with optical mouse. This type of mouse pad has been well received by everyone in our office. Some reviewers mentioned that it didn't stick to the desk. If that is ever a problem, clean off the surface of your desk and the underside of the mouse pad and adhesion should be better. When using the mouse it sticks to the desk just fine. Try it - I think you will like it. Also the round shape seems to work better than the traditional rectangular shape of a mouse pad."
4,"It's cute, but the back doesn't really stick","The design of the mouse pad is great. It's colorful and thin. However, the back doesn't stick and it can be annoying at times."
2,wrong pattern shipped,I was disappointed when I recieved this item. I ordered the pocka-dot print but received a different print that is not very attractive. As far as the pad it is paper thin and takes some getting use to.
3,Mouse Pad,"WOW!PAD 8.5"" Diameter Pastel Dots Mouse Pad--Multi Color ( 8DD17-010 )Love the Dots, but not as thick as I like my mouse pads. I am sure my granddaughter will like it."
4,mouse pad,I thought this had a lilttle cushie like most mouse pad.. Its as thin as a piece of paper. but cute we will find another one. This mouse pad needed more description on how thin it is.
3,mouse pad,"Bought this for the cheerful colors,when arrived the plastic that should have been on the back,was already off which meant the sticky backing was no longer sticky,but I just wet the back with water so it will stay still."
5,comfy shoes,I bought these shoes for my four year old daughter. I usually buy her Stride Rite because of the wide sizes but these fit her wide feet really well and seem very comfortable. She wore them all summer and won't wear any other sandals. They are indeed super cute!
4,Can't beat the price!,"The bag works great. The construction is nice - no complaints, not cheap. The side mesh pockets are awesome! Love them, can carry munchies and water bottles, etc. The only questionable item - the shoe compartment. A ladies 8.5 shoe is tight by my specifications. I would of liked to see a tiny bit more room in the bag. I would buy again and have recommended to several."
5,This is my favorite!!!,"I listen to this album at least once a day; I usually don't stick with music like that but this one is good, I am hoping it will wear off so i can listen to other stuff"
4,A Serious Historical Analysis,"Maria Todorova wrote an excellent book, which is a thorough review of the political history of the Balkan Peninsula. She explains the various political interests that have always been at play in that region.The author also qoutes different foreign travellers, diplomats, and writers showing their attitudes to the countries and the nations of the Balkans. The first part of the book (the first three chapters) will be specially interesting for larger audience while the rest of the book is more theoretical. Given the current events concerning the Balkans, and especially the disintegration of former Yugoslavia, this book will be of great help to students of history, political history, their teachers and intellectuals in general."
4,Dense in literary analysis of past Balkan writers.,"Todorova's book changed the way I viewed the Balkans. By analysing the way in which Balkan and Western European wrote about the Balkans, ""Imagining the Balkans"" shows how this peninsula became the recipient of totally negative and pejoritve notions about Europe. Todorova deals well with some writers sentimentality, and over romanticization which unfortunetly persists today and leads not to understanding but to cinfusion of the issues. Old metaphores such as ""the Balkan Pouder Keg"" are shown to be only a way of dismissing a whole group of people as ""irrational peasants."" Although quit heavy in theory, a worth while read for any serious history student."
1,Just Tell The Story,"I thought this book read like it was translated form a foreign language several times before it got to english. I spent so much time and effort trying to quote decipher references and credits I found it very difficult to read. It seemed like every sentence started outlike this ""According to Inyuc Geronovitch on page three of his book ......."" I think it may have been a good book but it was so distracting to read. I did not finish it. I did not even get through the first chapter I left it on an airplane. There is no way you can Imagine the Balkins with this book it is an absolute chore to read. I would like to tell the author to put up your thesaurus (we know you can use big words) use foot notes do not start every sentence with with some credit to someone. Try to be less of a far out creative writer. AND JUST TELL THE STORY"
1,Timex Women's Acqua Gold Tone Indiglo Watch # A63941,the watch does not work.........very disappointed gave this as a gift
4,worked well,was what i was needing to be able to watch dvd that i have and was able to fix disc to work in other dvd players
1,"DO NOT BUY, JUNK","I bought one of these units in Sept 2006 and there is no discs availablefor them as they need a 4x only speed which is not available. I calledEMERSON ELECTRONICS 3 times and finally got a reply that they won;t recordon dvd's that are rated 16x which all dvd blanks can today ,even if theysay 8x. FORGET ABOUT EMERSON. Trust me, I am out $250.00"
4,Good qualilty Bag,"Nine bag, good quality and looks, this was hard to find, in the stores most bags look like a purse or were to big. I use it for snacks, it could be used for a camera or video bag as well. At only $14 dollars it was a great buy. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is I wish it would have been about an inch or two taller, but overall I am very happy with this."
5,Grandson's Favorite,This book is a hit with our 2-1/2 year old grandson. He loves the subject and can read the book word-for-word from memory. Sweet story and colorful pictures.
5,My son can't get enough of diggers,"For his first birthday, my son was given the other book in this series ""Fire Engine Man,"" which he absolutely loved. So much that we added ""Digger Man"" to our library. It is one of those enduring books that he can't get enough of; that we've read so many times we no longer need to look at the words."
4,One of my 2-year-old's favorites,"This is a great book for toddler boys. The illustrations are colorful and fun, and the boy's fascination with diggers certainly rings true. There's also a touching angle about the boy sharing with and teaching his baby brother - a cute little story w/ a nice message.For those who like this I also recommend Dig, Dig, Digging and Emergency! - two great books featuring fun rhymes, terrific illustrations and lots of machines and cool vehicles that little boys love."
3,Amazon: Fix your part number!,"The sight looks nice, but as other buyers have stated, they ship you the wrong part. This listing clearly states in several places that this is model DBB130/3. When you order it, you are shipped model DBB130. They have different mounting hardware, so this item is useless to someone wanting to mount it on 3/8"" dovetails. I will be expecting Amazon to correct both this mistake (by shipping me the correct item) and this problem in general."
2,"Does not fit 3/8"" dovetail","I should have heeded the other reviews. Although a very nice sight, it is too big to grasp a 3/8"" dovetail.I purchased a Crosman 2240, added an extended barrel, modified bolt and a steel breech but can not use it because the red-dot sight would not mate to the 3/8"" dovetail on the Crosman breech. I am very disappointed.The sight is on it's way back to Amazon."
1,DONT BUY,I purchased this item for my Hi-Point carbine project. The sight itself looks ok feels kinda cheap. I could NOT adjust the dot in the horizontal axis. I bought a Leapers and have had no problems with it. Cant expect much I guess for this price however it does look good on my sons toy gun.
5,Expressive and captivating performance,"This is my favorite recording of Brahms' 2nd Piano Concerto. Rubati are perfectly placed, and both the orchestra and soloist seem to be playing their hearts out. This is one of those rare recordings of familiar repertoire in which the performers seem to be adding a bit of magic to their playing. The Boston Symphony sounds wonderful under Haitink. Yo-Yo Ma took time off from playing Tangos to record a very nice transcription of a Brahms Violin Sonata, with Mr. Ax. It's a nice performance, but it pales when compared to the Concerto."
5,Authentic DooWop Sounds of the Fifties and Sixties,"Whatout any reservation whats-so-ever, The Legends of DooWop are as good today (if not better) than when they first cut their hits way back when. I have personnally attended their live performances in Las Vegas. Their vocal sounds in person are absolutely remarkable! If you truly want to hear the best... and relive the sounds just as they were back then... treat yourself to this alblum. Then go see The Legends perform in a live show. You will be pleased beyond your expectations......."
1,Terrible!!!,Dead after having it for 6 days. What a complete joke. I don't know how you can sell a product as poor as this.
3,I don't know about this one,"Randall Robinson had some decent points and some good substantiating facts as well. However, I felt that there was quite a bit of fluff in the book and I'm just not comfortable recommending it to anyone."
1,"My white German ancestor was an ""Indentured Servant.""","My white German ancestor was an ""Indentured Servant."" Where is MY apology?Indentured servants worked side-by-side with the slaves. They got a raw deal, too. So where is my $$$? History has some hard and horrible moments, and should be preserved with honesty, and with an attitude of learning from it. I'm sorry that the African-American slaves suffered, and I'm sorry that MY ancestor was forced to be an indentured servant... But GET A CLUE!!! ""The Debt"" is not the answer."
1,Counterproductive: where are the Blacks in my chemstry class,"This selective reading of history manages to ignore thousands of whites who worked for the abolition of slavery in the United States. The author treats Confederate soldiers as whites who fought and died to perserve slavery, but he does not treat Union soldiers as whites who fought and died to end slavery. The author ignores the long line of whites who took great risks to advance the cause of racial equality: the northerners who went south to register black voters, many of whom were murdered, Lyndon Johnson's effort and success in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, passed by a predominately white Congress, Bobby Kennedy, Harry Truman and others...."
1,RACISM at its' best,"This book is totally ridiculous. It's guaranteed to keep blacks with a victim, welfare mentality! People need to stop blaming everyone else for their lifestyles, situations, and problems. No one is as responsible for your life as you are! Stop expecting others to pay your way. People are people and everyone has the same opportunities in this free nation, no matter what the color of their skin is."
1,file in sociology or humour?,former slaves in america alive today: 0 (reparations for whom?)affirmative action= outdated concept which creates and nurtures a 'as good as we can be' philosophy.if the usa should offer reparations to any blacks who are willing to relocate to africa permanently with no possibility of return... all this reparations noise would go away after not even one person would ever even think twice to take them up on their offer.
1,Paternalism revisited,"This is the sort of book only an american could write. Robinson's politically correct ideas do nothing to help the progress of balck or african people: to pretend that America or the world owe us a sort of social reparation for our history is nothing but an elaborate form of paternalism. In fact, our progress should flow only from our merit and work at present days, not from a debt inherited from the past. I believe we can rise to the job and stop blaming others for our problems."
1,I'm black...,"...there are many african-americans out there who are proud to be american, and not 'hyphenated'. we will always have our own special togetherness, but [stuff] like this is no excuse. ""united we stand, divided we fall."" - a motto for all of america. there's not enough wealth in the world to pay off all the debts for things that peoples have done to each other. remember slave comes from 'slav', like in the slavic peoples who coincidentally are not black but were in chains too. slavery was a terrible part of american history, but hundreds of thousands of ... white boys died to free the slaves so if that didn't pay the debt then no amount of money ever will."
2,Short on specifics,"I've long been interested in the question of restitution/reparations, and consider it a serious failing of our nation that this issue hasn't been considered or debated. So it was with great expectation that I read Robinson's book. I was hoping it would do two things: show that restitution is necessary, and show that it's possible. Unfortunately, it only did the former (and not as effectively as other books I've read). It lacked a serious and thorough analysis of legal and political precedent, the policy choices that would be necessary, and what political forces would need to align to make this happen. As a result, the argument sounded more argumentative than authoritative. If I hadn't already been in support of restitution, this book wouldn't have convinced me."
1,Irresponsible!,"Irresponsible is how to classify this book. Perhaps the author has forgotten that after the Civil War, President Lincoln said the 350,000 lives lost in the War were in payment for our country's past sins of slavery. There certainly isn't enough money in the world to pay reparations for every act of discrimination or prejudice suffered, but complaining and demanding money is not the answer, to do so is a disservice to African Americans. A better approach is to encourage the model for success that has been most effective for immigrants and citizens past and present: education, hard work, self-reliance, and responsibility. There are many good books to read -- this isn't one of them."
1,victomology 101,"Once you sift through the overabundance of useless adjectives to explain a simple point you will exhaustedly come to the conclusion that Blacks who are not successful need not worry or be responsible for their demise. The fault rests on that all time favorite whipping boy, the white man (gimme a break).As a Black man I find the premise of the book insulting and counterproductive. I was curious and wanted hear Mr. Robinson make a valid case but instead I got a headache. This book will go sit on my book shelf gathering dust, never again to see the light of day, next to Cornel West."
1,what america owes to blacks: nadda,"Those who subscribe to Mr. Robinson's views on this country and its supposed debt to blacks should ask themselves some hard questions. A. While Europeans transported slaves across the Atlantic, who went into the interior and captured them? In Roots, Kunta Kente is captured by 3 individuals, of whom at least 2 appear to be of African origin. Slave-dealing was a 2-way operation. B. What countries still practice slavery today? Sudan. C. Who designed the system of government that eventually freed black America from its enslavement? White guys, a large number of whom were slave-owners. D. Why, for every Rodney King, is there an O.J. Simpson? If America is so psychologically damaging to blacks, why was Marcus Garvey's Back to Africa movement such a flop, especially considering it occured in the 20's, a far harsher time for black Americans than today? I can't answer that one. Bottom line-superb writing, idiotic premise."
4,expensive,"Just letting people know, I have this, and I got it for 300 dollars so I think its a rip off on here."
1,Big but Boring,"This set is only good if you want to add a few thousand Bley pieces to your collection. The set is boring to build, tons and tons of little bits that are built over and over in the same patterns. The challenge comes more from keeping the set from falling apart as you build because the base, and support structure is weak."
1,Not Well Designed,"Like many my age, I grew up with Legos. My wife bought this kit for me for Christmas. I was excited. After a couple of days of work, my excitement had turned to frustration and finally to anger. This kit is poorly designed, and the instructions are not well thought out. First, the ""Death Star"" is built on a base that you construct of Legos. This base is not very sturdy. The instructions said to put a bunch of parts just on one side. Left alone, the structure would tip over because of the imbalance. Much of the structure had such flimsy connections that the slightest thing would break connections. I don't mean the quality of the Legos; those things are impossible to break. I mean the way in which various bars, hinges, etc were put together.In the end my wife and I probably spent 40 hours building something that would not hold together. I love Legos but this kit gets nothing but ill will for me. For lack of a better phrase, this kit sucks."
1,LIKE BUILDING WITH TOOTHPICKS,"My son purchased this set for me for my birthday. I am an adult female and have put together many lego sets. After 4 days, my frustration level had hit a peak and the set has been put away. Everytime you try and attach a piece, a former piece falls off, especially the circle which holds the lasers. Put in a laser, the circle falls apart. Great design but extremely poor construction. Would have been a great set if the legos just stayed in place the first time instead of reattatching them 10 times."
4,Don't jiggle the table!,"Santa brought this behemoth for our 8 year old this year. Translation- Dad spent 5 days at the dining room table with every bowl in the house being used to sort Lego's.This kit is one of the older style kits. The bags aren't numbered or labeled with any sort of key. All 2000+ pieces needed to be sorted out for building ease.When building the Death Star, have boxes handy to prop the model up. You build it one half at a time. (left-right)It tips over whenever you let go.Our son loves the model, and was able to help with the building process, but it's only a matter of time and Nerf darts before it's back to square one."
5,best Christmas gift ever,"I bought my 7 year old son the Death Star for Christmas. I was a little worried because I had read some of the reviews, but figured since he had built all of the other star wars lego's ships we would give it a try. I am so glad we did. It took him 2 1/2 weeks, but he finally finished it. It is something he accomplished all by himself and we couldn't be prouder!!!! It took alot of patience and was not easy. But if a 7 year old can do it so can you!!!!!"
4,Lego Star Wars Death Star 2 good experience,The Lego is fun to put together and takes a long time. But when it is all together it is VERY flimsy because the base isn't very large. I would recommend getting some extra black and gray Legos and making the base larger for better support.
5,GREAT,Recieved Item in a quick and timely manner which my wife loves because we were able to do our Christmas cards and were able to send them out quick. Thanks again.
5,just 5 stars?!?!,"Ever since I was a kid, I have always been into King Kong. Sadly, Ive seen alot King Kongs, and well it always hasnt been a pretty picture! Some have portrayed him as a giant clown in a rubber suit crashing through cardboard buildings. Others have played Kong off as an overgrown pervert, while others made him into a freak of nature with a temper to match! Alot has been lost throughout the years. I guess for a while I thought it was always going to be that way, but not with Kong: King of Skull Island! Let me tell you...this book is great!!! If you are like me and are tired of all the Kong wannabees! You got to get this book! It has alot of beautiful paintings and it explains alot about the mythos of KING KONG! Lets face it, the original movie left us wanting more. This book gives you that and then some! I wont spoil the details! You just have to see it to believe it! Now, get the book! and oh yes...have a nice day!"
5,Awesome,"Kong returns once again through the artwork of Joe De Vito. His genius in creating this book shows on every page. Through ""Storyteller"" the secrets of King Kong and Skull Island are revealed. Is it fantasy or did Kong really live? The secrets are revealed in this spectacular book!"
1,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--A negative view,"I've read it. I really wish I hadn'tThe illos are nice, but the back-story makes no sense at all. And the writing goes downhill the further you get into the book. By the time you reach Kong's origins, you no longer care.Clearly, the art was created first, and the book was ""written around"" the images. This rarely, if ever, creates a readable book.Go see the movie. Either the original, or the new one. Heck, see the 76 version, even THAT'S better than THIS.The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs DOWN!"
3,"Great art, unsatisfying origin tale....","As a stand alone story this tale will keep you interested throughout, but as the origin of the Great Ape and his home it falls somewhat short. Thankfully some amazing artistic renditions of the lackluster text bring the story to life and keep the pages turning until the end.All in all a nice presentation of mediocre ideas. Is anyone else sick of raptors yet?"
3,"Great art, lousy story",The title of this review pretty much says it for me. Could have been great. I don't care at all for the story. It's very far from the mythology of the 1933 film.
1,Another rip off,"Sorry, this is just another rip off. King Kong is the most wonderful story ever told. This is just another come lately cashing in on the legend. I couldn't even make it all the way through this attempt. Cooper must be revolving in his grave."
3,Ken Sushi Vidceo Volume 1,The quality of the procudtion was not good. But the cook was fantastic. But the camera men did not do a nice work. To many picturen without sharpness.
4,Damaged CD case..but over all VERY GOOD!,i got this CD pretty quickly from the factory itself..the package that it came in could have been a little better becuase when i opened it the edges of the CD were cracked and fallen apart..but the CD was NO WHERE NEAR damaged in anyway..this CD is slapp..im very happy wit wat i got.
4,One of those CDs you buy for just one song,"Ok so for years ive always loved the song ""Hand of blood"" so I finally got this cd, and well thats about the only song I like on this CD. If you like having every song you like on CD like me then get it! but if your looking for a bunch of cool songs in a CD I would get another Bullet for my valentine CD."
2,Slow on 3D Acceleration,"Although the graphics were great, the performance of the Voodoo 4500 was well below my expectations, especially when it came to playing 3D games that demand the extra RAMs. So if you're looking to buy a 3D card for the sole purpose of playing 2D or 3D games (like I did), be willing to spend an extra Benjamin for better quality."
2,doesn't dry well,I thought this would be great for our new car but it didn't really dry it that well. We will go back to using towels instead. It was kind of pricey too.
2,He could have had a V8,"In a set of articles by great men that could have been worthwhilewe have a failure. I know because I have something real to compare this toas contrastSource Book in Mathematics. What results is very like ""The End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age"" in content.What we have here is an anti-mathematics thesis with only vague pointsto the real stuff.What results is a dumbed down collection that is really unworthy of the author.Praising this book is like praising vanilla pudding!Without the whipped cream of the mathematics the pudding islimp and colorless. What we really need is a true source bookwith the real material in it.The closest I've seen is Roger Penrose's ""The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe"".In dumbing it down there is no protection against science and the mathematicsthat makes it work ."
5,Amazing! A Miracle!,"I have suffered fatigue & exhaustion, esp. in the morning, and severe chronic depression for decades. I happened to read about this at [...], and it sounded like something that COULD help. In three weeks I can now function again! If you have suffered from fatigue, depression, anxiety, cloudiness, or thyroid problems, this supplement will do wonders. Take it, though, every day!"
3,Thorne Research Products-Best in Business,"The Rhodiola that I have ordered now twice from Amazon has provided a me with a lower level of coritsol, as this was prescribed by my doctor to help me get my hormones in better balance. I had worked a very high stress job for 17 years and my stress hormones were all out of whack, this product in additon to diet changes has helped me get my stress hormones back in balance. Will continue to use the product as long as the results continue."
1,not the study i expected,i thought this would be a great study with stories but it was a lot of gibberish and not a good book for me personally
2,Confusing,The use of old style type of language made this a hard book to follow. Thought I was getting a book that would make the Bible stories easier to understand.
2,hot and sweaty,"Really wanted to like these and ordered twice according to Wickers websites size chart. The second order fit my hips but the waistband's elastic is too tight and sits so high that it is uncomfortable. Additionally, the material that the waistband is made of does not wick or breathe. They just felt hot and uncomfortable while I exercised, but they did dry faster than cotton panties after exercise. My husband purchased a pair of boxer briefs and he said the same thing - they felt hot during exercise but did dry faster."
2,Noooo....Uh-uhn...Uh-uhhhhn!!!,"This movie wasn't exactly terrible, the plot was decent at times although it got dumb in the middle.1. I think there are a few charachters that were needless and brought down the quality of the movie. The cooks (the son and dad) kind of made this movie dumb for me, along with the cousin and MC Lytes charachter. None of these charachters really improved this movie.2. Treach was terrible as well. He's always been a terrible actor to me, ever since Jasons Lyric! In fact, imagine Treach's charachter in Jasons Lyric, well it's the same charachter here just bald!3. And this plot twist that every one is talking about was not that big of a suprise. I figured it out the first time the ""other woman"" came to the house. If you pay close attention you'll see this plot twist and it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO dumb.The only thing anyone has said about this movie that I agreed with is Allen Payne and Elise Neil had good chemistry. I would love to see them together again."
1,Horrible,"Don't waste your $$ or time. Just caught this on cable. The underlying love story was the only thing that kept me watching, but it's just extremely disappointing. Bad plot, bad acting, cheezy, gimicky, and sorry. This had the potential to be better, but someone dropped the ""ball"" on this one. I can see why it's not available on DVD. Who would want it?"
2,Not one of Allen's best movies,There were two reasons why I continued to watch this movie.1. Allen Payne. I love him and think he acts very well when given good material to work with.2. The Last Scene. I was curious to see if Allen was going to get with Elise. I figured they would get together. This was the best scene in the movie.The movie was a little too ghetto for me and $13.99 was too expensive for this trash!
1,utter rubbish,"this is the WORST album Ever its disgusting.its not even rap its pop music even spice girls are better.i felt sick after track 2.then i binned it.listen to kanye west instead he's gansta and superb.overall avoid this trollop of dog mess.also he doesn,t swear enough.listen to eminem dr.dre and dmx if ya'll want gansta rap. just lose it ahahahahahaha-Eminem"
3,Gone in the Night,"Watched the movie on TV but it ran over the 2 hours I had set for it, so we never got to see ending. That is why I bought the book. This is an interesting story and a sad one."
2,WAY SMALLER than I thought it would be,"I thought by this stating that is was 19"" long I was getting a good sized toy...if fits in your had with a long tail. Not what I was expecting."
4,The Blu-ray of 10 is almost a 10,They did a nice job cleaning up this movie over the original DVD release more than a decade ago. For the age of the film it looks quite presentable however given the likely audience and sales projections they weren't going to make this a reference quality release. Part of the reason I upgraded was just to get rid of the old flipper disc and snapper case. The audio is just a plain jane mono track which serves the dialogue adequately however we are used to a more immersive experience these days. For the bargain prices of this release it is worth an upgrade. If you've never seen this movie you are missing a classic. This launched the careers of Bo Derek and Dudley Moore into the a-list.
3,Hilarious Yet Ridiculous,"Even the title for this film does not fit into anything. Dudley Moore's character once mentions that Bo Derek's character is an '11' on a scale from 1 to 10... so why is the film called '10'!?!Anyway, as usual, Dudley Moore provides a lot of good laughs, not only in the slapstick genre and his classic drunk scenes. And these moments are the only highlights of an otherwise outdated and therefore nowadays ridiculous film.Sex? None."
1,"Cut some scenes out, rather disapointing.","One of my favorite scenes was where Dudley Moor was hemmed in by three semi trucks, this scene was not in the version I received. They should state if the movie is complete or edited."
5,Very Sexy Movie,The movie 10 brought many trends to America. The cornrows in Derek hair began a national fashion statement. It welcomed the fresh British humor of Dudley Moore that had not been seen in this country since the arrival of Monty Python.
4,Likeable comedy,"This is a likeable, interesting comedy. The movie is mostly remembered for Bo Derek, but her screen time is far less than the two main stars, Dudley Moore and Julie Andrews, portraying a couple with relationship problems. The supporting cast is also good. This is a film for adults, with plenty of nudity."
2,"""Arthur""-ian realism.... funny but dissapointing","title- funny, but dissapointingAlthough Dudley Moore was a funny and talented actor...it seems that he is playing a sober Arthur here. He's just a lot hornier.It could be said that in this film, Moore represents the common man obsessed with the ""perfect"" woman... That's just not conveyed here. And Bo Derek just isn't my taste in women anyway.I thought this film, with it's shrug-your-shoulders ""eh, so what?"" plot, really wasn't anything special. It wasn't bad, but not great. It's funny, but it's almost exactly the same film as ""Woman in Red"" with Gene Wilder. Both films are equally boring.MY HONEST ADVICE: If you want to see a great Dudley Moore film, see ""Arthur"". His comedy style is personified there.If you want to see Bo Derek, go out an rent a swimsuit video of her or something. I'm not being sarcastic. It's not worth seeing this film if you're seeing it just because you think Bo Derek is hot."
2,10 gets a 2,"This is a frustrating movie. George is a talky guy, so much so that he manages not only to bed 3 different girls, but to leave those beds as well without doing ANYTHING - but talk, that is. He spends half the movie chasing Bo Derek and her husband on their honeymoon, only to realize once she lets him in her bed that ""this can't be right"" and ""what am I to you?"". Sheesh, HE sounds like the woman. It just doesn't make any sense - the movie defies its own logic and expects us to buy it. Julie Andrews, almost sexy, still comes off rather sternly prim, in spite the occasional swear word - give me the Sound of Music any day.. to sit through this schlock in the name of comedy.. where's the comedy! What's funny about this? The whole thing is an exercise in sexual frustration - Dudley's and finally, we the audience's. It's supposed to be funny, but except for a few nude shots of Bo Derek, this movie is a lame excuse for entertainment."
5,"Re-Visiting ""10""","I watched this movie over the Christmas Holidays and was glad I was alone, because I had forgotten there was very explicit language involved. Having aged since my first viewing, I don't find that it adds anything to the content. But, I still enjoyed the crazy antics of Dudley Moore and found myself laughing outloud... when he was bitten by the bee, ... when he visited the Priest! I was possitively pooped trying to help him back up the hill after his comical roll to the bottom....and I could actually feel the bottoms of my feet burning as he tried to walk on the sand in Mexico! Yes, there is much to enjoy in this film and now that I own it, I will be able to do just that, many times in the future. MANY Thanx to all involved at Amazon for making this a pleasant transaction. Lila Gayton"
4,10,"Very funny movie, dudley moore is hilarious as he is chasing bo derek throughout the movie. A classic movie for sure."
3,Movie 10,"I have always loved Dudley Moore.He is the funniset actor ever. But, I've seen this movie a lot.When it first came out I would have gave it 5 stars, But seeingit again and again it was not too thrilling to me.If you have not seen this movie ""10 I recommend you to see it."
4,An underrated comedy,"All the hype around this movie was about Bo Derek. This was one of her first movies and she did look spectacular in it, but what is lost in all that hype was the fact that it was a funny movie about a guy going through a midlife crisis. You have to keep in mind this was late 1970s early 1980s humor. It was very different than the comedies of today (even the good ones). Whether or not you will find it entertaining is completely subjective. One of the things that really works is that Dudley Moore was not a typical leading man. He becomes obsessed with Bo Derek's character and ends up following her to her honeymoon destination. Of course by the end of the movie he realizes that he did not really want her, and how content he was with his own life. If you have seen the movie on TV and enjoyed it, it is certainly worth a DVD purchase."
3,Amusing if you like that kind of humor,"There are some very entertaining, clever, and witty episodes but much of the humor comes from seeing a middle aged man being drunk. The drunk antics get to be silly and sickening after a while. The smoking of a drug does not help either, and the songs are terribly uninspired."
3,"Useful information and CD, but, needs to be updated.",Good book to become familiar with the various concepts and tools. As you read it though you can see it is nearing its usefulness and needs to be updated.
5,Excellent!,This book fills a void in IIS documentation and the CDs are packed full of useful tools for an IIS4-based web server. A book that is well worth the money!
4,Not Whey Protein Powder. Just Powdered Whey.,"It's fine, but I was looking for something organic to make a protein drink with for workouts. This is just dehydrated whey, so two tablespoons has only 3g of protein. Oops! If you are looking to make an exercise drink, this isn't the whey you're looking for. Find something that says whey *protein* powder."
2,220mg sodium per 2 tbsp!,"I hesitate giving this such a low score, but according to amazon 2 stars is ""I don't like it"" and it's true I don't like it.I wish amazon would display the nutritional information for products they sell.But they don't so I was surprised when I received this very salty carb loaded product.You can find the nutrition information on your own on the frontier web site but here's the details:Per 2 tablespoons:Calories 70Fat 0Cholesterol 0Sodium 220.0mgTotal Carb 15.0gSugars 14.0gProtein 3gAs you can see one serving is almost no protein. 2 Tbsp is not a lot, I end up using 2 servings in my shakes (440mg sodium!)By comparison bob's red mill powder for the same amount has 20mg sodium, and .5g carbs and 8g protein.Also several reviewers state this whey is from grass fed cows. There is nothing on the frontier or amazon web site that claims that the whey is from grass fed cows. It is certified organic but organic certification allows the cows to be fed grains as long as they are organic."
1,Salt Bomb - Beware,"This product is LOADED with sodium and barely has any protein. I bought it so i could supplement my protein needs with a shake that would bring my protein levels up. With this product, all you get is salt. I don't know how they can market this product as a protein powder. It barely has any protein. Had this been disclosed to me prior to buying it, I would have never ordered it. I looks like an inexpensive organic protein powder. But don't be fooled. This is a low quality product. I sent mine back and got my money back."
2,Room for improvement,"If I would have known the protein count was only 9 grams per serving I would have shopped elsewhere. For the price, that is not acceptable to me. Improvements that I suggest to Frontier: 1) List your supplemental facts on your amazon pages so we know your per serving amounts. 2) Pump up your protein powder with MORE PROTEIN. 3) Have a resealable bag. 4) Find a way to get this powder to mix instead of keep it's granular form even when blended. 5) Flavor, please flavor this somehow. The sources of this protein being from a cheese process makes me think I've finally nailed what I think this stuff tastes like. Right from their amazon page: ""Dry sweet whey is the by-product of the manufacture of hard cheeses such as Cheddar or Swiss."""
4,"You can learn a lot, but there are some flaws","This book is HIGHLY instructive and more open than most. It takes the realistic stance that you probably won't have access to a master teaching this material, and acts accordingly. The photos laying out the form are clear and concise, and the text instruction is excellent and also very clear.The only problem lies in the line drawings. While they're generally pretty good, some of them do NOT make clear how the stance/strike is performed, which makes things confusing when you get to the photos. The balancing stance drawings, for example, don't show the hands exactly as they're supposed to be (refer to the first practical application in chapter five for the actual positions.) These are really rather minor, but if you're a rookie like me, it can trip you up.This is a minor complaint, though, for a great book. If you're interested in this art, pick this book up post haste!"
3,a book that is easy to understand and read.,"I enjoyed this book. It starts you off with basic knowledge of stances and strikes, then shows application of the techniques. The book also has good pictures and explanation that are easy to follow. The side notes in this book explain some things that you would not pick up from just the pictures. This book is a plus to your martial arts library."
3,Black Tiger Kung Fu,"This was a martial arts book that I read in the 1970's. I think it is a good book considering the decade that it was written in but for today's more practical reader's and practitioners of the martial arts I am afraid it would fall short of expectations.If you are a Chinese martial arts enthusiast you will enjoy this book for the written sections on background, history, and practice of this old style."
2,Shantung black tiger,"This book goes over techniques that are in the form (kata). There's a decent amount of detail in the techniques but a few of those techniques are completely unrealistic and useless (""the lock turning action""). If you want to learn a form, go for it. Also it has different self defense application to be used against different assaults. Finally, they never even talk about any kind of ""tiger claw"" strike!! If you aren't interested in a form don't get it."
5,Moss is a dynamic poet of witness,I had the privilege of having Thylias Moss as a professor on two different occasions at U of M...her poetry speaks volumes to her ability to show a reader and a listener a new perspective on life. Her work should be remembered in the same category as Neruda and other greats.
3,"Sorry, falsely advertised on Amazon","There is a snafu in Amazon's description which I'm sorry to report is false advertising. While this product is the excellent quality we expect from Meguiar's, it is advertised as ""4 feet square"". When you look at the actual product, it is labelled as ""4 SQUARE FEET"". Are we now so mathematically illiterate that we fail to see the actual size is 25% of what was promised in the Amazon description?The one I received, would require some stretching to meet even 4 square feet. Perhaps it would be larger when wet. I wish I would have ordered X2200 larger size.Amazon is not living up to its usual standards of excellence, in describing these products. A naive customer might think they are getting a really large chamois, when actually it is rather small. All the Meguiar's chamois products sold by Amazon are described by Amazon as much larger than the manufacturer says. This over-promise should be corrected ASAP."
1,Poor quality,This product does not absorb like a quality chamois leaving streaks. I threw it out after the first use and purchased another product.
2,Good history but poorly written,"I had hoped that this would be a great book written by a Panama Pilot, but the poor writing could have used an editor. However I plowed through it and got a real sense of the transition of the canal from US to Panama."
1,I Hate this couple,I went back to watch the first season of The Amazing Race and how dare anyone praise this couple as being heroes of the gay community. Before I continue I would like to say I myself am gay and was very disguised with the actions of these men. Did no one notice that their actions were down right nasty towards the other team. Which I feel just gave the gay community more of a bad name. In the most simple of terms. F@%k them.
2,Don't waste your money on this one.,"After being an avid fan of the Mind's eye series, this title was a huge letdown. There is little music included in this short 30 minute video. Most of the computer animation is simplistic and uninteresting. The only real eye-popping animation is just a regurgitation of the exact same animation already included in ""Odyssey into the Mind's Eye"", which came out a year earlier. My recommendation is to leave this one alone - don't waste your money."
3,it's okay,"I bought this video in the VHS format, and I'm glad I did not spend extra for the DVD, though I tried to find it on laserdisc. Great computer amination, but it was too short compared to other computer animation titles in the mind's eye series. Portions of Turbulence had already been presented in Beyond the Mind's Eye and Oddessey to the Mind's Eye, but with different music."
3,Unnervingly good...yet not quite the best,"As a longtime fan of the Mind's eye series, I enjoyed this. As a watcher, I was sort of creeped out. A lot of the material is somehome psychologically unsettling. I can't put my finger on why, but parts struck me as nihilistic and abstract, very unlike the uplifting feeling brought on by the other videos. You can buy it if you want. Just be careful."
3,TURBULENCE,"AS A DISC JOCKEY I'M ALSO LOOKING FOR GREAT GRAPHICSTURBULENCE IS SHORT IT'S ONLY 28 MINUTES. WHICH WILL MAKE THE GRAPHIC SHORT, WAS PLEASED WITH SOME GRAPHICS, SOME GRAPHICS I WISH WOULD BE LONGER. SOUNDTRACK DID NOT DO ANYTHING FOR ME."
4,"The ""Grandness"" of it all!","One of the most epic battles ever fought, This video of ""Waterloo"" grandstands the pageantry and pomp surrounding the inter-relationships between common man and gentry within the context of open battlefield warfare!You can witness the colour and splendour of the uniforms in their magnificence as the Generals, like shepherds mustering sheep, herd their masses of men ""to & fro"" to their deaths.Witness how the apparent flippency of these actions belie the calculation and orchestration of primal strategies relating to this era of open battlefield warfare.This video helped place into context for me numerous events of the battle which had only been envisaged through books, such as distances between opposing lines and ""flanks"" and sizes and numbers of armies and cavalries etc. Also I was able to better understand the the entry of ""Blucher"" and his Prussian army into the battle, and more importantly the timing and effect this had on the outcome.Awesome!"
3,instructive,"this book is very useful for a person just starting out in pastels, as I am. I thought that there could have been a wider range of techniques discussed."
2,Painting in pastel?,"Handell""s current work doesn't impress me as much as his former style. Sometimes longtime artists get carried away with their own notoriety, and get just too artsy. This is more a""coffee table "" book than something to learn from."
2,Very Lightweight,"I am a beginner to the art of pastel painting/drawing. This book is below the level of a beginner. It is long on talk about color, hues, values, and lots of things that a beginner doesn't really care about. When it comes to ACTUAL TECHNIQUE, HOW TO PUT PASTEL ON PAPER AND MAKE IT LOOK THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO, THIS BOOK IS VIRTUALLY SILENT! I have recently checked a book out of my university library that is the best book I have seen yet (the author's name escapes me now). It has about 10 demonstration paintings where the author goes through the various steps of creating a pastel painting. In contrast, Painting the Landscape had 1 or 2 such demonstrations and only about a page of nitty gritty on technique (actually applying pastel to paper).Stay away from this book. It isn't worth your time."
3,Academic painting.,Far too academic. Fails to consider the sponteneity this media evokes and the inherent emtionality of each individual.
4,The great days of the forties,D-Day brings back all the memories of the forties. Your CD of the Andrews Sisters for just a few pounds has given me more pleasure than a world tour - serious!
1,For FAT wrists only!,"Watch is attractive (arrived running, which I don't like as it depletes the battery, with correct day and date but incorrect time) but the ""adjustible"" band is a farce.My wife has a medium wrist, not small, and adjusted all the way down (only 1 hole on the band to use)leaves it far too loose for her to wear.Now I have to take it to a jeweler (time and money!) to have some links removed. Our nine-year-old grand-daughter actually picked this out and paid for it with her own money. What do I tell her about buying another one for her mom's birthday? ""No way!"""
5,Great patio dinnerware,"Perfect pattern for summer meals on the patio, and nearly unbreakable. What's not to like?! Well, only that they don't reccommend putting it in the dishwasher. Otherwise - perfect!"
2,Watch the size!,"I ordered one of these for my 11-year-old son and it was far too small for him and he was never even able to wear it. When they say ""youth"", they are talking about a very small size, so be careful when ordering."
1,what happened,"What happened here? Fennelly's debut collection of poetry was one of the best collections I have read. It was really phenomenal, so when I heard that her new collection came out, I got very excited and ran out and bought it. Then I read it. This is really a bad book. The language is flat. It is syrupy. And I know children are a joy, but for crying out loud, find a new topic. It's not that they were pretty much all (with one or two exceptions) motherhood poems, it's that they were bad motherhood poems. No, avoid this book and go grab Open Houses if you don't already have it. This collection is really a disappointment."
1,"Well, I'll be...","I don't know when I have heard so much heated talk about poetry! Wonderful! I do have to say that I thought Ms. Fennelly's little book of poems was a bit on the trite side, but bless her heart for putting these quaint little poems out there. Every one needs a hobby, after all.That Mr. Ward needs to write a little more clearly if he wants people to take his views to heart and that sarcastic man from Atlanta might better stick to talking about the poems instead of attacking other people. But that's just the opinion of one woman.Keep up the good talk; we all need to bring poetry to light and life!"
1,Disappointed!,"Well, listen to those people who rave about this book if you want to, but I read the poems with a poetry reading group and most of us just didn't like her stuff. I can see how some people might connect with it, but it's pretty boring if you ask me. I'd like to unload my copy---pretty cheap, in fact."
2,Just went to a reading of her poetry,"First, Fennelly is NOT a Southerner. Second, and maybe more importantly, her work is typical of the MFA poetry mill verse which plagues the current literary landscape. Her themes are risky, yes, if she was writing about them forty years ago when introducing the idea of women's bodies and being frank about sexuality and reproduction -- in the way she does it -- had not become hackneyed. Certainly there is much serious work to be done in exploring these issues, yet Fennelly simply cannot rise beyond cliche. In fact, much of her work might easily be considered reactionary to the important causes of women. This collection is shockingly absent of thoughtful responses to serious contemporary concerns, and I was disappointed."
2,So-so,"I've spent a life of hard work and living so I can retire and enjoy the fine things in life. But so much of what I thought was out there to reward me with the arts is so far from the real world I know that I am let down time and again. This book came with a lot of mixed reviews so I thought something controversial might be between the covers. Sadly I found more of the same---poetry from someone who has spent too much time in the world of the academy to know the real trials of the heart. I'm sorry to report this, but it is really the way I feel."
5,quality,"You can't go wrong with Rustoleum paint. I have bought Rustoleum in many colors for many painting projects and it is a very high quality paint. I never have any problems with runs, drips, or a clogged nozzle. I use it for indoor and outdoor applications."
1,Garbage!!!,"Wow! What a concept paint for plastic... finally a way to freshen up all my cheap stuff that should have made with a better material! YAY! :) ...until you try and apply a second coat because the first didn't coat worth a darn! After following directions to wait at least 48 hours to apply a second coat, my pieces (the plastic trim rings from recessed ceiling lights that had yellowed over the years) had alligatored up within a couple of minutes! Totally ruined... so I wait another 48 hours and sand off all the melted paint... OK so here we go again... this time ""screw it, I'll just coat them once this time and leave it to be""... HAHAHA Joke is on me... ALLIGATORED AGAIN!!! Long story short, STAY AWAY - TOTAL GARBAGE! If it's plastic and it's worn out, go buy a new one made from a better material such as metal or wood and don't take the cheap approach because it will end up costing you more time than it's worth!"
5,Hoot Loudly and Swing a Big Stick,"What, no reviews for a book which emerged from a tiny small press collective to become an American Book Award winner? Griever is a delight, a postmodern absurdist melange which offers a scathing indictment of suppression of human rights in China, and, more broadly, government and individual hypocrisy and the manner in which both big business and big government degrade human experience. Vizenor uses the common thread of the trickster in Native American and Chinese culture to present a fantasized version of his travels to China on an academic exchange program. He becomes a trickster Monkey King and all sorts of hell breaks loose. You can bet that the Chinese government will not be inviting Vizenor back soon, but I invite you to read Griever. It's a hoot! (Jim Dwyer is author of Earth Works: Recommended Fiction and Nonfiction about Nature and the Environment. Buy it here at amazon.com.)"
3,Zimerman plays Chopin,Krystian Zimerman must be the best pianist to play Chopin I have ever heard. Absolutely brilliant. The quality of the c/d was quite good except for the fact that one can hear someone (Mr. Zimerman) sniffing away during some of the most tender parts. It would have been nice to have that filtered out.
1,Short life time,"I've owned 2 of this model and 1 of another Braun. All had unusually short life times and became erratic time keepers after a couple of years. Not sure why, maybe there are plastic gears inside that just wear out? I really like the design, but after 3 of these not-cheap lemons I will not buy another. Not recommended."
1,Braun AB5 round Travel clock,"Having really enjoyed the older version of this alarm clock, we ordered it but weredisappointed that the new version makes a ticking sound unlike the old one, sowe were unable to quietly fall asleep next to it. For those less sensitive to the lightticking sound, it is a great clock with easy to use controls and a simple, elegant design."
2,Not as shown.,"The font of the digits on the face of the clock I was sent doesn't look like the picture (or the original)--curly helvetica instead of spiky no-nonsense futura. The work is reasonably quiet, but not as quiet as the original with its sweeping second-hand. No sweeping here. I'm disappointed. I wish someone would make a trustworthy high-end, super-quiet, version of the original's wonderful, timeless design."
2,My trip to the supermarket this morning was more interesting,"I was very disapointed with this book. I'm recently teaching many Ghanains and hoped this book would give me a liottle bit of insight on their culture, but it was just a boring travel journal. I would not recommed this book, unless you're a good friend or family member of Mr. Gaines."
5,Non-Stop Intrigue,"I received this book on Thursday. I finished it Saturday! I could not put it down. It has been a while since a book captivated my interest like this one. The dialogue is genuine, the characters are human and each page is action packed. I look forward to more of David and Ricky's antics."
4,"READ IT, LOVED IT, PASSED IT ON, AND THEY LOVED IT TOO!","The next W. Mosley or C. Himes. I read it; loved it, passed it on to others, and they loved it too. When can we expect another from the author....."
1,I dont know why I finished it.,It was really awful. If it hadn't been a book club choice I would have tossed it in the trash after the first chapter
1,Do NOT buy this book. There are better alternatives!,"I own all of the books written for Logic, and this one is among the worst!! Its more or less a transcription of the manual without any new insights. It doesn't have the fresh idea of Len Sasso's book. It doesn't have the step-by-step approach of the Apple published book. It doesn't have the down to earth, cut to the chase lucidty of Bennet's book.Merton's book is a topic by topic rehash of the manual, and rather boring and misleading at times. In fact I prefer the free manuals that come with Logic 7 which are well written... and don't cost a penny extra. I guess you can put a snazzy title on a book and make it sound important. But just as you can put lipstick on a pig, it doesn't make it a lady.Plus, Logic 7 has been out for months, and so this book is already out of date! Just forget this book!"
5,Noisy fun method to aid little walkers,My one year old grandson loves this toy. He pushes it up and down the halls of our house with a huge grin on his face. Walking behind him makes his parents laugh because he jauntily struts as he pushes. The toy has helped him with coordination and balance while he is having fun. He took his first steps just a few days ago. I don't think he considered this achievement nearly as enjoyable as pushing his alligator.
3,Smaller gauge than advertised,"I compared this 20 gauge to my other 20 gauge studs and this one is more like a 22 gauge. It is quite a bit smaller in diameter. I was disappointed, to say the least, especially since I had already taken it out of the package when I compared them. They do not accept returns after the package is opened. I can not wear this so now it sits in my jewelry box. :( It would also be nice if they offered different lengths because this 3/4"" is just too short for me. If I were able to wear it I would have to bend it AFTER putting it in my nose and then unbend it to take it out. The quality of the nose stud & gem is great though."
1,not what i was hoping for,"the actual gem on the nose ring was nice looking, very shiny. however, I ordered a gold ring, and got one that was silver in color- the seller never got back to me about exchanging so I used it anyway. It fell out within a couple of days (even though I bent it pretty good inside my nose) and I wound up needing a new one. If you buy this, make sure you check it often because it will fall out!!"
4,Nice looking item,"This is the first external hard drive that I've purchased (and I'm not a tech-savvy at all) so I'm not sure how it compares with others, but I'm happy with it. It looks nice and it's not small but light and easy to carry around (not that I do). I haven't had any problems so far, and it was very easy to use (installing was simple, as others commented)."
1,LaCie Hard Drive,"Had a bad experience with this external hard drive. Was not recognized by my Windows PC Operating System when I plugged it in, even though it was supposed to be both PC and Mac compatible. My guess is that it is a programming error at LaCie. Contacted the distributor (Instock Novelties) re returning the defective item and was told that I could not return it since I had removed it from the box. (I swear that is what they said.) Now how could I have known it was defective BEFORE I openned the box?? I have not taken any further action, since I think I may be able to reprogram with a FAT drive myself. If that doesn't work, I will try to get some action by LaCie. Safe to say though that I am not happy with this external hard drive. Nice looking orange cover though!!"
1,Fram is trash,Fram is trash. I have removed several fram products that were brand new and their removal and replacement with a WIX product fixed a drivability issue. please save yourself the trouble and get a WIX product like NAPA or well WIX.
2,too big,"we got it for our 8 yr old and it was way too big,probably would've fit a jr.high child or older"
2,Defective twice,"I recently ordered the new u2 ipod photo and when it came the ipod was not placed in the middle of the box, it had slid down to the side. i also noticed that the faceplate on upper left corner was loose, it made a squeeky noise. so i returned it back to amazon n the second one came the same way, not placed in the middle of the box and with the squeeky/loose on top corner of the faceplate. i think since apple is selling these so cheap that they are just half-a$$ing the quality of the ipod. this will eventually ruin their reptutaion.. I RECOMMEND BUYING THE OLDER NON PHOTO ONES, much better quality"
1,False advertisement,The price listed for the U2 Edition iPod was too good to be true. The seller later on backed off from the sale. Please do not fall for this kind of false advertisment.
5,Awesome!!,Everything is awesome! The special edition rocks! You just have to be careful cause' it scratches very easily
5,A THRILLING BOOK!,This book is very exciting. After they find a person from the gang they know that someone in the house was a murderer. They try figuring out who it was but they didn't know for sure. The most exciting part was the last 20 pages. It was fun trying to figure out which one of them it was. You should really give the book a try and all the other Fear Street series books because most of them are great. So next time your in the libray or bookstore get this book!
3,Good Book,"This was a good book. It was not one of R.L.Stine's best but it was still good. I read it in one day. The book was about a group of teenager's ready to spend the weekend skiing but then the host get's murdered, one of them is missing,someone knows a deadly secret, what happends? You'll have to read it to find out...."
3,Grows on you,"I'm more a fan of Jimmy's songs and basslines but enjoy several of Kevin's songs as well. I'm disappointed by the lack of relatively fast songs on this album. I thought it started great with the upbeat and slightly funky ""Declinometer"" but it tapers off fast. I miss the culture clash of Zydeco, Rock and Tejano music with the funky basslines and horns from Stadium Blitzer.After a month or so of listening to the album, I'm really enjoying it. Give each new Gourds album it's fair share and it'll grow on you."
3,Heavy Ornamentals ain't so heavy,I'm a big fan of this band and look forward to each one of their new releases but this latest effort is my least favorite. It still has some great songs but I find myself skipping a lot of tracks which I normally don't do on their earlier stuff.
3,Disappointing,"Maybe it needs to grow on me, but unlike my other Gourds cd's this one isn't getting much play"
4,"My first taste of The Gourds, and I like it...","I saw The Gourds live in Amsterdam in The Paradiso's upstairs hall- all 80 of us. They played from 2-4 on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Great show...not only did I buy this, their latest cd; I even bought me a tee-shirt. Not a weak track here- and I read here that they recorded this in two weeks while recently on tour. This cd sounds very much as though it were live- and in the case of The Gourds, that's a good thing. Standout tracks are (for me, clearly): Pill Bug Blues, Mister Betty, and the cr?me de la cr?me...Shake the Chandelier. Very solid folk/rock more often on the rockin' side. See these guys live, in a great little venue near you- you won't regret it. ps: And a special 'thank you' to The Paradiso's ticket saleswoman who sold me a ticket to The Hackensaw Boys (from 4-6 that same afternoon) and let me in for free to see The Gourds, since I arrived at 2:30...also, if you don't know it already, Amsterdam is one fine fine city."
1,old version of red dragon,it is just an old film it has poor quality and i suppose it may just be because it doesnt have the hannibal that im used to but i didnt care for it at all.
5,Even better than Color Choices,"This book does go beyond ""Color Choices"" in that it is a more extensive review of the importance of value and intensity...great stuff."
5,Painter's Guide to Color-Stephen Quiller,Visually Stimulating. Extremely informative in regard to mixing colors! I was so excited to find a book that had so much visual information about the color wheel. There are many examples to refer to and learn from. A must for any painter!
3,Colour,"Not a beginner's book, this book was way over my head....but I am sure that once I improved it will make more sense to me and I will enjoy it....I know of a couple of advanced artist that swear by him, but I am truly just a beginner"
2,Disappointing,"I can't believe this book got such ravishing reviews. I had such high hopes after seeing all 5 star reviews in Amazon. But what a disappointment this was.It feels like a text book including very basic diagrams of a human brain and spine. The author's accomplishments are of course great, but the book is not interesting to read. I'd rather search his name in the internet and learn the basics of his research.The book opens up with the author's childhood in Vienna during world war 2. You'd think this would make a great story, but the author is not a good story teller."
2,It is what it is...,"I found that the book was not science-y enough to keep my interest and that the biography aspect was...hard to digest. I quit reading about a third of the way through, which is hard for me - I hate giving up on a book when I've invested that much time into it, but there are just more interesting things to read out there than this."
1,Not a scientific book,"I purchased this book looking for some scientific analysis of how the memory functionnes ,Iwas totally des appointed as the book is a biography of the other witch is soooo boooring ! I indeed up deleting it ."
1,Mental Midgets,"In Search of Memory is a book to avoid. Eric Kandel is a Phd scientist with a Nobel prize who wrote a book packed with random meanderings about his personal life and his research into the subject of memory.Unfortunately, Dr. Kandel has neither the ability to write nor anything to write about. I expected to find out what scientists know currently about the human brain and how that brain becomes a conscious entity. If that is your expectation, don't look for it in this book. His use of the jargon used to describe parts of the brain is about as close as he gets to presenting anything factual. Forget this book and look for something else to read."
3,Ho hum braggado,"Perhaps in the name of humility Dr. Kandel persuades me that by tying in with a variety of more diligent scientists, he managed to win a third of a Nobel Prize. He also persuades me that whining, in-group elitism and greed will mark forever his type."
4,Reductionist view of the mind,"A very good read! The history of brain research focusing on animals with large neurons and axons. Faced with the limitations of then current technology scientists have developed sophisticated research methods to determine how neuron, axon and dendrites function."
5,Entertaining read,Well written with a good back ground in the history of neurosciense and the technical aspects of how memory works. Enjoyed the portrayal of the interactions of scientists as they developed in their fields of study over the years. A down to earth record of Kandel's life and obstacles faced by the Jewish scientific community.This book provides some good illustrations assisting with the more technical points of his research. It is a great introductory book for those wishing to do further research into the exciting field of neuroscience.
5,Reads like a detective mystery even if you know how it ends,"Kandel has written an absolutely delightful mix of memoir and science as explains the how and why of his discoveries. I was amazed to see the influence that Nazi Austria had on his thinking. An Austrian born Jew, he escaped at a young age. If you know of Kandel's work, you know his discoveries about memory and how he tackled problems over his career are pure genius. If you enjoy neuroscience and a great memoir this won't disappoint. I've been a huge fan of his since med school, but even if you've never heard of him you'll be very impressed with this read."
4,a great balance: presenting memory,"This book, for me, is a great balance between something from a New York Times bestselling book to an academic text addressing memory. If you are new to literature on memory and memory research perhaps a book like Schacter's Seven Sins of Memory is better. If you are interested in a more academic approach as a beginner to memory perhaps Alan Searleman and Douglas Herrmann's Memory: from a Broader Perspective is a better choice, but admittedly dated.I did find some sections a bit hard to read, but all in all it is a pleasure to have such a book filled with intricate details of memory, memories consolidation, and a view from the neurological/anatomical level. Kandel is a legend in the field, and in academics, so it is doubly enjoyable to read his literature from this perspective as well, for me.The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and RemembersMemory from a Broader Perspective"
4,Sand Scoop,Scoop Is a little flimsy and arrived a little bent. It should suit me needs. Not bad for the price. There is some sharp edges also.
1,The worst text book ever,"My university requires this book for the discrete mathematics course. I have to tell you, this book teaches you absolutely nothing! The author barely explains things. And when he does explain things, he explains them as if the person reading already has an indepth knowledge of advanced math. There is no explaination as to how he arrived at answers at the back of the book.I actually have to buy another book because I got so frustrated trying to learn this, that I ripped the book almost into shreds. And its only been two weeks into the term! I'm contemplating emailing the author to tell him to quit writing textbooks because this one is horrible.My recommendation is not to buy this book unless you have no other choice."
3,Par Exposition and Expensive,"I used this book for a one semester course on discrete mathematics. First for the bad points: This book is unnecessarily expensive. 1/3 of almost every page is left blank and has unnecessary text and pictures. If there is one thing a poor college student doesn't need is an expensive book. I've read through the majority of the reviews here. Most of them stress that the book is difficult to follow. Indeed, some proofs and examples are difficult to follow (unless you have the intuition of a genius). The author's exposition of the material is not bad, but not good either.I'm currently trying to solve some of the more interesting problems in the book from each chapter. I must say though, some problems are INCREDIBLY challenging. I've been through many instances where I've required outside help to solve some problems.Conclusion: I don't recommend buying this book. It's too expensive and its exposition of the subject is at most average."
1,Makes a math nerd hate math,"This book is almost maliciously complex. The explanations are awful. I usually love math, but this book is starting to change my opinion. If I could, I'd hunt down this Johnsonbaugh fellow and beat him with a copy of his own textbook."
1,Worst book ever read in college history,Do not what so ever get this book. You will regret every dollar you spend on this piece of junk. Its an absolute terrible mess.
1,Terrible textbook for a difficult subject.,"First I would like to add I do not own this book, but had to rent it for a class. This has got to be by far the worst textbook I have ever used. Not every key word is in bold like most textbooks have. Probably the worst is that there are not even definitions for some keywords, but examples which can throw a student off easily when trying to solve a problem; that is, if any example is provided. Some students may learn by looking at answers in the back of textbooks and reverse engineering other answers which is a technique for learning how to solve a problem by comparing problems and answers. It is not possible with this book as some sections for the proceeding problems do not give the answers. Best of luck if your teacher selects this. Google will be your best bet when seeking out an easy technique to solve any problem given by the book. Though, I as a student would not know of a better Discrete Mathematics book to use."
1,Views of a College Student,"This book was used in my discrete mathematics class at the university that I attend. I was very disappointed with this book. It fails to explain how to work the problems in an clear, effective manner. It doesn't teach, it assumes that the student already know how to do most of the aspects of the book."
2,The book is very inconsistent.,"Having used the book for my first and second semester of Discrete Math, I have found it to be of poor quality. It provides overly detailed info in the first few chapters, then switches to provide almost no help at all for the remaining 4 to 5 chapters. Without a good professor, one is lost using this book."
1,A difficult book to understand.,"This discrete math book is definately not for beginners. I took 1 yr. of calculus and I had a very difficult time understanding some topics. The author fails to explain the ""whys"" in later chapters and he uses too much mathematical notications instead of explaining them in common english."
2,NOT worth the price!,"The author is not very clear when explaining examples, the author is not helpful when trying to teach a beginner into discrete math. Trying to learn this course on your own is very difficult without any good clear home work problems. The answer in the back of the book are selected, it seems that the selected answers are the more easy homework problems. I was not satisfied with this book at all. I struggled with the course because it was a challenge teaching myself through you tube. I do not recommend this book."
1,So hard to read!,"This author seemed to think that making things complicated makes him sound smarter.Starting class, I read the first few chapters and was lost. After our first study group, I got it.Not with the help of the book, but going around all the lenghty BS that this book contains.This author talks his way into a situation, contradicts himself, and then moves on.I'm not sure if he was getting paid by the word count, but it seems that way.If you want to learn Discrete Mathematics, read the summary at the end of each chapter, get into a study group where someone has already taken the class, and look online because you will not learn it with reading this book, but you will be more confused."
1,Awful!!!,"This is the worst math book I have ever had to read and I am a 4.0 student in math. The author throws letters of the alphabet around like confetti in his examples-first it's x and midway through the explanation it is f. Had to have it for a class. Good thing the instructor was easy and the quizzes were open book so I could look in the index since I didn't learn a thing-and yes, I DID study it!"
3,Don't buy this book,"Not understandable at all, we don't even use this book in class, the teacher gives his own examples of key concepts. The book doesn't explain core concepts very well at all. Don't buy this book unless it is mandatory."
2,Not the best,The examples and detail in this book are not great when compared to other discrete/finite books.
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE,"This is the worst textbook I've ever used in any class - high school or university. You basically need to already know Discrete Math in order to understand the material in the book. The examples aren't relevant to the exercises in the least way possible. Definitions are hard to find within the text, so if you're looking for a definition of a new term in the section, it's quicker to search online than rummage through useless pages of garbage (searching online would give better examples than the book, as well). At least in a typical text book, definitions are bolded and easy to find - in this book, they don't do this, let alone anything else, to help the reader easily find key words.The only reason I even open the book is to do the assigned exercises. Don't try to read the material from the book - you'll only confuse yourself. I rely on class notes and the internet to get the work done. Otherwise, this book is completely USELESS. I advise you to avoid it at all costs, if possible."
1,This is Bad... Really Bad!,"I used this book last semester in my Discrete Mathematics class in Minnesota. This is by far the worst mathematics textbook I have ever seen. I was in the hospital for appendicitis and missed an entire week's worth of class. Usually this isn't a big deal, I would just read the text on my own. I think it is very telling that I could NOT understand what I was reading when I tried to catch up with what I missed in this class. I actually had to meet with the professor and he had to take time to go through each lesson with me. I have to believe there are better choices out there. I am begging professors to find a better and easier to understand book!"
2,Discrete Mathematics,I feel with others: it is a disheartening book. It will give you pains rather than the knowledge of discrete mathematics. Try other titles unless it is unfortunately a required textbook.
3,Its An Ok Book,"The reason i say its an ok book and give it three starts is since it is only useful if you have some computer science background and know how to code a bit. I found that this book indeed had many algorithms that helped me in my other classes. The reason its not so great its because the book did not show in some cases on how to solve the particular problem given. Sometimes even my professor would say that was a bad idea of the author to use a a method while their some a lot easier, and yet the internet is not so useful with Discrete Mathematics i tried looking up some tutorials and no such luck as like with calculus or algebra. Overall if your looking for simple algorithms this is a good book. But for serious long explanations on how to obtain a answer in discrete math then no."
1,"Never waste your money on this book, --;;","We are using this book to learn ""Discrete Mathematics"" this semester. I really can not imagine why the math department chose this book. The book is in a word too wordy. It make some simple concepts complex, and hard to understand.Maybe Prof.Jonsohnbaugh is, though a good CS professor, not a good mathematician. Actually his book of O.O.P. in C++ is very good.Don't buy this book unless you are required to buy it as a textbook, --;; like me, or you think you are very week in math."
1,Math at its worst,I have always held the belief (even as a mathematician who favors analysis) that math is suppose to be elegant. This book is anything but elegant. It currently resides in my dorm for the sole purpose of a clip-board so that I may lie on the carpet and work out problems from other texts. I had the unfortunate pleasure of suffering through two semesters of this book. The first semester (the first half of the book) was not bad given that we never referenced the text. The second semester was much worse given that most of the information in the course came directly from the text and its examples. If you are looking for a beginners discrete math book... look elsewhere. I can distinctly remember taking a course in precalculus and discrete mathematics my junior year of highschool in Maryland. That book was actually tollerable.
1,"""Distastefull"" Mathematics","This is one of the worse math book I ever bought. As a computer science major, I usually keep all my major related text books but this one has got to go in the shredder. The author fails to fully explain the examples which forces me to reference other math books for guidance. There are solutions to selected exercises in the back but those are all easy problems. However, the challenging questions does not even have a guided example in its respective chapter. The author's explaination are often too difficult and too shallow to follow and you would have to read it two or three times just to get an idea. Enough venting, I have to reread chapter 1 again so that I have some idea what chapter 4 is about."
4,Massive 1930 Film Version of Antiwar Classic,"This fine, early sound film has been preserved on videotape in exquisite black and white without any embellishment- it needs none. The book was probably shoved down your throat self-consciously in high school English, but here it's brought to vivid life. In this beautifully filmed version one can see the cinematographic seeds of what will become modern moviemaking. The movie is pretty powerful and intersting, but a bit long at 130 minutes. Well worth the time to watch, though."
4,A good WW1 movie through the enemy's eyes!,"All Quiet on the Western Front, is the story of a young German boy, Paul, who is eager to go towar, but he slowly comes to the realization that war is not as heroic as it has been portrayed. Paul ends up surviving the war until a few days before the armistace, when he shot by a sniper. Since the orginal film was made in 1930, the sound is poor in parts. Depite the poor sound, it is an interesting WW1 film from the ""enemy's"" point of view."
3,All Guiet on the Western Front,A good story line but mild when comparedwith modern movies. I see young men luredinto a conflict with little hope
5,Wasted,"I am really sorry some people out there hated this film but it says more about them than the movie. I suggest they go back, get the latest Bond movie out and stop annoying people with their 'whining'. If you don't have the attention span of a gnat and can make allowances for when the film was made then buy it now."
5,Important war drama,"One of the most important war films ever made is this excellent adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's fine novel, directed by Lewis Milestone. A group of eager German students enlist for service in World War I, heedless of warnings from their professors and families. These guys are just itching to be heroes, and the army propaganda has promised them that they will be. The cinematic ballet of war scenes is unlike anything cinema had seen before, and the realism of war in this film is completely at odds with the candy-coloured beauty of propaganda films made a decade later. To make sure World War II hopeful soldiers wouldn't be deterred by the gruesome images seen here, this film was banned in America not only for its pacifism but also because it presented German soldiers as sympathetic protagonists."
4,All Quiet on the Western Front.,"This film still retains much of the power of the story of this miserable trench warfare. Although I am not sure how digital restoration works with this film,I wish it had a little more crispness to some of the sequences. Overall I enjoyed(almost an oxymoron) it immensely and will share it with friends and familyfor years to come. I consider it a great asset to my historical film library and would recommend it without hesitation. The fact that the main character played by Lew Ayres became a pacifist during WW II is a statement of the impact that it made on his life."
3,Better than you think!,"ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT is a great World War I movie, however I enjoyed the 1979 color remake a lot better. The movie shows the point of view of a group of German school boys who are encouraged to enlist in the war. In the beginning, enlisting is viewed as the right and honorable thing to do, but that soon changes. I liked watching the boys transform from young school boys into hardened soldiers. Since the movie was made in 1930, the sound is not that great and hard to understand at points. This film is a good movie for studying World War I."
3,Incredibly three-dimensional characters in WW1 film,The film lacks profanity but it's characters do somehow come off three-dimensional all the same for a special reason I won't mention here. Check the film out and see why for yourself. Hint: it's in the last quarter of the film. I see the obvious German-expressionist influences in the film (fitting the film is all about Germans)especially early in the film with the teacher and his students.
2,Read the book instead,"I didn't think this was particularly well done... in comparison with the book it can't hold a candle. I was surprised at the good quality of the film, for being so old. I didn't think that most of the actors looked right for the parts, particularly Kat. And the movie dragged on and on and on....I guess as I watched it I kept thinking of better ways this could have been filmed to coincide better with the powerful impact of the story.See it if you like, but I really can't recommend it..."
5,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A compelling adaptation of Remarque's classic novel, All Quiet on the Western Front offers striking images--including battle scenes that look great today--and a wonderful ending that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the book."
5,All Quiet on the Western Front,"Still potent and poignant seventy-five years after its release, All Quiet portrays the genuine bewilderment of enlisted soldiers at the front-- the soldiers who often fought and died never understanding why. The movie transcends dated elements to convey the full tragedy of youth and innocence lost."
5,All's Quiet,"I had gotten the movie for a friend, but watched it before I gave it to him. (Bad, me...) Seriously though, NICE DVD mastering!"
2,Unbelievable...,"This is truly amazing.. in our generation of lazy people that we have to see a movie about this classic book. You can never recreate the emotion and all out carnage of this book, not if you had the best director and actors on earth. You CANT fell what it is like to spend weeks in a rotting trench, having to fight off the rats even more so then the enemy. You CANT recreate what it is like to see men die choking deaths while coughing up their lungs, and seeing raw flesh from real men splattered on the ground. The book is the real thing. That's how you get the experience.. you have to know their thoughts and fears, and you have to imagine them, not see them."
2,"Dated, despite what they say","Though this movie was undoubtedly a shocker in its time, its depiction of young Germans in the trenches of the Great War is rather too dated to be effective for an audience watching it for enjoyment. I have no doubt that as a historical piece, it is unsurpassed, but so it is with ""Mein Kampf,"" which almost no one would wish to read as leisure. The sound and picture, even on this version, are quite poor. (Earned a sopt on AFI's 100 best American movies list.)"
3,Very dated,"I'll have to go against the trend and give this movie only 3 stars. I am sure that when the movie came out in 1930 that it was well received and deserved several awards. Seeing this film for the first time last week was a dissapointment for me. The acting is very ordinary and the battle scenes are dissapointing. The film has dated. For a good WW1 DVD get ""Paths of Glory"" by Stanley Kubrik. This film was also set in WW1 and was in black and white. In my opinion a far better movie. For it's time ""All quiet on the western front"" was a landmark film. Today it seems almost corny."
2,Not a classic...,"I've seen the film twice now, and it is dated. A classic stands the test of time: what had been called naturalistic acting in this film is today melodrama. Of course, this is a landmark film, but it does not hold up ""suprisingly well."" The second time I saw this film was in a film appreciation class, and people litteraly laughed at the movie and couldn't wait for it to end. It's a time capsule film and nothing more: it's important for the time it was made and the effect it had then, but it doesn't hold up. ""Grand Illusion"" is a classic war film and should be seen as the quintisential WWI film. The only reason to see ""All Quiet..."" now is for film history."
1,"So Bad, It funny","What else make this movie even funnier, the hype of course. This movie was soooo awful, you will laugh your a** off!The acting is so fake. The funniest part whenever anyone whines in it. I really don't know why all the critics think this is the best war movie of all-time, they must been stone while watching this worthless trash. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this film the same way as Gone With The Wind and The Godfather."
5,The Best Decorating Book Ever Written,"You probably won't make your own lampshades, but Diana Phipps can show you how. She knows how to do everything - or at least, some version of it. She's modest about her considerable accomplishments, and her good humor makes this book enjoyable as well as useful. When last heard from (in Architectural Digest) she was back in the Czech Republic, refurbishing the family castle. But if Random House wanted to make a buck or two, they could reprint this book: it's timeless. If you like the look she gets (and I do, I passionately do) you couldn't ask for a more encouraging guide."
1,Don't bother,I found this book disappointingly tedious. Frankly the few photos included were not at all inspiring and I never saw the ingenuity that she is supposed to impart. I have collected all sorts of decorating books - this will not be one I keep!
2,"ridiculous, way out of date","This book is way out of date. Ms. Phipps wants every surface swathed in fabric. Ornate and fussy--the opposite of clean lines.As an amateur decorator, I was shaking my head with every chapter."
3,"Okay, but...","Wow. These ran small. Very thin.Used them as pants for an ""Ooompa Loompa"" costume. Kids had to wear white underwear w/ NO pattern -so as not to show through on stage.BUT, they came in time."
4,Life saver!,"My son always runs small in everything he tries on and this product was our only hope. It was a little thin and since it was white, it was a little see through but he only needed it for 3 months and it fit him perfectly. I'm glad we ordered it."
1,Burns out after 3 months,"I was glad to find this bulb listed, but when I bought the coleman lantern with bulb, it last 3 months. I ordered a replacement and it lasted 2 months. I think this may have something to do with the lantern; when it gets low on power. Seems they could make the lantern sh nut off before the bulb gets too little enery and this happens."
3,Spy vs. Spy,"This comic strip is a classic. Creative, imanginative, and hilarious. Brain teasing because you have to look carefully at the sequence of what is going on. Antonio Prohias was brilliant in his creativity. His history at the beginning of the book is very interesting."
5,This is the ultimate collection of Spy Vs. Spy.,"What started as a project to print every single Spy Vs. Spy strip Prohias did (plus some that were done by his successors) evolved into a tribute to their creator.The strips are all here, but there are also a couple of nice essays and rememberences detailing Prohias flight from Castro's Cuba and life in America. Plus they printed some of his pre-Spy Vs. Spy strips.These strips were meant to be read once a month or more. I've noticed if you read too many in a row, they lose their edge. Still, that's no knock on the work. If you remember these strips from childhood or liked the animated Mad TV segments, this book is well worth a look."
5,spy vs spy complete!,"Classic book with background information. Creative, imaginary, entertaining & impossible enterprises detailed. Great for adults to younger teens. Originally purchased for my 12 year old and so popular he and his friends that we gave several as gifts to his friends. My 8 year old also picked up the book and spent time studying the pictures and laughing at the absurd lengths these spys go to."
5,My Favorite Section of MAD Magazine,"Spy vs. Spy has always been my favorite section in MAD magazine since I first started reading it many years ago. Each new issue I got, I would immediately turn to the ""Joke and Dagger Department"" which is specifically reserved for this strip. It was not until I was much older however did I realize that Spy vs. Spy were really a parody of the cold war. This book is the complete collection of Antonio Prohias's iconic creation including every Spy vs. Spy he ever illustrated. Additional biographical and bonus information on Prohias is another amazing feature of this collection and his immense contribution to MAD magazine is truly shown. The Spy's elaborate methods of destroying one another will keep you laughing for hours with this book! Which Spy will win next? Black or White?!"
3,...,"When i bought this book i thought that it was some sort of thriller horror novel, but i think i was wrong. When i got through the first fifty i was confused, but i kept going just because i had hope that it would get better. It didnt. I couldnt tell you what its about. When i got to page 150 i just stopped. It was just too hard to read. Maybe i didnt give it enough attention when i read. I gave it three stars because i didnt finish it so i cant judge it completely.."
1,Poor Quality,"I am very disappointed at the short life of this power supply. It had the look and feel of a well-made product but the unit failed after just two months. There is an internal fuse that continues to blow, so something must be shorted in the circuit or transformer. Pay the extra money and buy something that lasts."
4,Make great birthday cards,"Love these French watercolors, especially the floral ones versus the not as interesting landscapes. But I used the floral ones during a busy month of birthdays, and all enjoyed getting them. A good bargain."
2,Not good as Expected,"We tried Supreme, size 4 to my BB, and it is not the best fit to him. The material is not soft, and absorb less than Pampers Cruiser. Huggies size 1-3 regular are pretty good, now, we turned to use Pampers."
2,Huggies has NOT done their homework! LOUSY diaper!,"We have used almost every diaper out there on the market. Huggies is a brand prone to much frustration, because although the diaper itself has excellent absorption, it is NOT designed to hold in baby's pee pee and poo poo as well as many other diapers we've tried. There is not enough material on the sides of the diaper to hold everything in! And it is not that easy to put on baby, since the tabs and diaper sag, and are hard to position under baby. In conclusion, there are many other brands that blow 'Huggies' away. This diaper is WAY overrated!"
4,These are great diapers for the ab/dl lifestyle,"These are the only diapers that i have had sucess fitting into that will actually stay taped, they are very comfortable and although they are tight around that region they hold quite a lot"
1,now i know... and knowing is half the battle,"I got this a long while ago at an electronics store. I thought I was getting a good deal... digital pictures from my computer, web conferencing, the works. Well, it was fine for little while, until i learned better. This camera's software is just awful. It crashes every few still pictures you take, doesn't adjust to light very well, and there are always glitches when i make movie files. The pictures are always blurry and the camera doesn't adapt to any other type of software that i've tried. It's bad. I'm getting a newer, better megapixel digital camera to take some real pictures. Save your money. This one is terrible."
2,Incompatible with Windows XP,"Running this on Windows 98, I did have some problems, such as poor video and graphic quality, but when I upgraded to Windows XP and went to Kensington's website to find out about updated drivers, I was told that 'due to an unforseen compatability issue', the camera wouldn't work with Windows 2000 or XP. so before you buy this camera you might want to think about whether's it's worth not buying XP...or if you already have XP, don't waste your money."
1,Not Stable at all...,"I received this cam as a gift last year. The software is supposed to work with Win 98, but it kept freezing up during the installation process. There was no helpful tech support on their website regarding this issue either.My friend who bought it for me took it to see if he could get it to work on his Mac(he has OS 8 or 9) and he could actually install it, but the software always crashes for him. He ended up just buying me a different camera in the end because it never DID end up working correctly."
1,The little camera that never cut the muster,I was unable to get this camera to work on my Mac G4. Kensington support indicated it would only work in the USB plug on the back of the computer. The only problem with that is where do you plug your USB bus and Keyboard ( which has to be plugged directly into the computer to function properly ) I would gladly give it ZERO stars but that is not an option. Thank You Wayne G.
1,Stay away!!!,The image quality of this camera was not so great to begin with. To make things worst Kensington stopped supporting this camera a while ago and doesn't provide XP drivers so now as I upgraded to XP the camera is simply useless. Save your money and stay away from Kesington.
1,Disappointing at best,"First the good news: After a long time of trying different things and messing with it to no end, I finally got it to work and played with it for a while.Not a glowing recommendation, is it? The bad news is, the video quality was horrible and unless I sat in a completely lit room with many lamps and bulbs pointing directly at me it was hard for even my mom to recognize me. A couple of times I chatted with family on it, I being the only end with the video transmitting capabilities, and the output was just irregular and ... well, disappointing.It was fun while it lasted."
5,Great shorts,I ordered these short for my husband and he loves them. The fabric is soft and comfortable and the colors are great too. The shorts fall right at the top of the knee and they fit great. Good buy for look and price.
1,Unfair Comparison,"I bought this book solely on the recommendation that this author wrote like Rosamund Pilcher. To be fair, I thought it highly unlikely that an author whose name was unknown to me could be compared to R. Pilcher, who I think to be incomparable. But I took hope in hand and purchased ""Until the Spring."" It's not a horrid book, but it's not anywhere near the caliber of writing that was promised. Her characters remain undeveloped and uninteresting to the end where her plot ends predictably leaving this reader relieved that it's finally over. Please recommend a book based on the author's true merits, not by comparing her writing to someone whose talents are in an entirely different class altogether."
2,My own view.,Publisher's Weekly got it right in my opinion. The plot suffers from the disjointed narrative and long stylish descriptions.
4,Know when to buy!,"This book has some great advice on the business aspect of owning a stable. However, unless you are planning on starting a business in the very near future or already have a business set up, I would advise to wait on this book. Half of the book (I'm not exaggerating) is blank forms for use when seriously planning your business such as income statements, payroll forms, contracts, etc. Being a student with not-so-near future plans on starting a horse business, these forms are useless to me at the moment. The nice thing about this book is that it emphasizes the importance of a business plan. It even gives a sample business plan to help those of us who have never written one and find the process a bit confusing. All in all, it is a well-written book with some great information for the serious horse business owner."
1,Don't Bother,"If you know the least little bit about budgeting and keeping a checkbook register, you don't want or need this book. For me, it was a total waste of money. Don't waste your money if you have a PC with Excel installed."
3,Twisted rails,"I rated this movie with a three star because I enjoyed seeing the old trains and the round houses, however, overall I would rate the movie plot with one star.When it open, the movie immediately jump into a scene where a railroad employee shows up at his boss office and says that he knows who is causing the trains to crash, then he is shot.The plot is not coherent. Actors come upon the scene and you are left trying to figure out what they have to do with the movie plot;, later on this become apparent. Scenes jump from one incident to another and it leaves you wondering how they got there to begin with.I do not wish to reveal the full plot of the movie as some may want to buy this movie."

4,A Funny Thing Happened On The Way Back From The CD Store...,"...I popped Mike Viola and the Candy Butchers Falling Into Place in my car CD player and what did I hear? The best Graham Parker CD since The Mona Lisa's Sister! The darn CD was mislabeled! It said Mike Viola and the Candy Butchers on the CD case and on the CD itself, but the music was a new CD from Graham Parker! And man what a CD GP has put out here. There are a couple of tracks that don't sound much like what I am used to from Graham Parker, but for the most part this puppy is top-notch GP throughout. ""Too Much Going On"" is classic Graham Parker all the way. I just don't know how such a mistake could have happened, with both the CD case and CD being mislabled like that. Oh well, guess I will go back and pick up another copy of Mike Viola and the Candy Butchers, but I am keeping this new Graham Parker CD. Way to go Graham! Keep it up!;-)"
1,Contrived and forced. How could you people recommend this?,"Nice packaging. Not good pop music, however. Neither catchy nor melodic. Very contrived and very forced. If you were expecting Fountains of Wayne, don't look here."
5,Great songs that get better,"I first heard this at Tower records listening station and there were enough hooks to grab me. Since the second or third time through, it's pretty much owned my car CD player. The lyrics are intelligent without being heavy, and the songs are very singable. I like Viola's voice, too. Great CD!"
1,not as described..,the air pump said its for 60 to 100 gal tank..I tried to use it with my air bubble strip and it doesnt work at all...too poor air not strong enough as described.
5,Works like a charm ...,Have the air pump outside under a tarp working 24/7 keeping a hole in the ice of my pond open. A great product both in doors & out.
5,Great baseball pant,"I purchased these b-ball pants as a gift for my husband whom is very picky about his athletic apparrel...after viewing several different brands and types of b-ball pants (which I know nothing about) I finally decided on this pair. When I received them I was very happy with my choice, but the real test was yet to come. Needless to say my husband was very surprised and very happy with my choice, they were the perfect size, and length...not bad for an internet purchase. The pants wear well and wash well, trust me if anything he knows how to get dirty playing baseball.."
5,15 Minutes was worth waiting for.,"The single 15 minutes, is perfect for a romantic evening with that special someone. The snippets, Chocolate Mood, Compass Love & Too Friendly are definitely attention getters. I am impatiently awaiting the release date. This album will definitely be one of my favorites for a long time to come."
1,I give it one star because I cannot give less,"Why is this ok? The sentiment of this song is just too tired. But I guess this is all people expect these days. Even Jay-Z has that ""6:15 and I'm puttin' her out"" line. Why don't men who feel like that's all they want just start breaking each other off?Whack. That's all I can say. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Fine guide but leaves out too many interesting areas,"A fine, well-written guide if it covers the places you want to go. I found it leaves out completely too many areas of Germany and focuses only on the well-known tourist areas. These areas are covered very well with comprehensive and easy to use hotel and restaurant listings.A fine chapter is the Scenic Drive Along the Baltic - a lovely part of Germany with marvelous brick-Gothic churches that still seems undiscovered by English-speaking tourists."
5,Typical Frommer's,"I usually enjoy the Frommers format and approach to guidebooks and this one is no exception. It is beautifully detailed on the major cities but I found it less so for smaller and rural places. At times, the maps, especially town maps, are not that detailed but that is for me a lesser problem as I always get or buy proper maps from the tourist office / hotel / bookshop. On the other hand, it does have nice diagrams of the major museums. I also love the long lists and detailed descriptions of restaurants as well as the sections on what to do after dark in the major cities. However, I needed another guide once I wandered off the better-known and more rural destinations."
4,An escellent buy!,"This is a Depardieu combination-plate guaranteed to please the entire family. TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE is a fable about two masters of the viola da gamba de Coulombe and Marrais: gorgeous music and lots of imagination. THE COUNT OF MONTECRISTO has always remain a family favorite and this on leaves no one disatisfied:French revenge at its best. And for chronic soap opera addicts, CHANGING TIMES fits like a glove; there is love enough for all. An excellent buy."
3,Not as good as expected...,"I have watched all the films and found them to be not as good as expected. Changing Times was watchable, I felt. Tous Les Matins de Monde appeared to be set in Versailles, but was infact set in a country house in France and was rather a depressing film, not one I would watch again. Gerard Depardieu is not very believable as a chubby prisoner in The Count of Monte Cristo and when he dons a false nose as a disguise, rather hilarious. Ah well live and learn. Not as good as expected trio of films, I felt."
1,Ick...barely worth the 1 star rating.....,"I tried to like this book, really, i did...but the only part i could stand to read was ""Dark Seed."" The first half just couldn't keep my attention. I'm glad to be finished with this series and hope to have better luck with Broken Wings and Midnight Flight."
5,WOW Another V C Andrews book,There has not been a V C Andrews book that I have not liked and the same can be said for this one.
4,Great read,Excellent book in the series. I could not stop reading until I had finished this book and the whole series!
2,Hidden Leaves---Why bother?!!!?,"Okay, I must first say that if you haven't already bought this book, then don't bother. If you haven't already read the novel it is predictable, boring, and does not give anymore insight to the characters than the first four did. It is a major let down. Also you can down load Dark Seed for free.What happened to all the secrets and character insights that used to be divulged in the last book??? IE-Garden of Shadows, Web of Dreams, and Olivia. This book was seriously lacking and I had higher expectations.Also what in the heck was up with the errors???? I caught 2-3 times where they made messed up and called Kirby by the name of Kyle. Doesn't anyone check these books before they published???? Also, if you bought Into The Woods you already are aware of the historical inaccuracies. And my copy had the inside cover picture upside down.If you want to read good V.C. Andrews novels I guess you have to stick w/ the Flowers In the Attic, or Heaven series."
3,Little Crawler,"There was a very limited release of ""Crawler"" from Sony, Japan.I was lucky enough to get it, the CD quality is a ten, the coveris just a small copy from the album. Lyrics are included.So why was Crawler & Snake, Rattle & Roll cut down to justa limited number of songs on this album. The first album AllSongs are worthy. This is a poor release, they could have easilyplaced both albums on One CD. This one is worth buying, butdon't give away your old cassettes. Less for more?"
2,dajingxiaoguai',"I cannot fathom the general positive response to this novel. True enough, here and there crop up like mushrooms after the rain a few cavils about some features; but, on the whole, reader reaction has been overwhelming enthusiastic--enough, clearly, to produce a minor constellation of gold stars (gongxi, gongxi to the writer!) and encourage the publication of further ventures in what has become a Bund-and-beyond series.Perhaps the mystery within the mystery might be revealed, as in a sudden enlightenment of the Kill Bill variety, if someone with the inclination to detail the particulars of both reviews and reviewers makes a complete diaocha of the Sinologic knowledge of all parties concerned.Still, while the social coordinates and the basic interactions of the characters are plausible on an East or West grid, the plot is still plodding; the personalities predictable; and the poetry, as translated, irritatingly insipid."
5,Literature Meets Detective Story,"As a former colleague of Xiaolong Qui, I had the pleasure of reading an early draft of this novel. I thought then and I still believe it is a unique melding of literary and detective genres. Those interested in China will be easily engrossed in Inspector Chen's world and certainly willing to read through the passages on its political and social history. While some may find the historical passages didactic, they are necessary to a storyline dependent upon an understanding of these forces. And these characters lived in my mind a long time after reading them."
3,Poetic and enjoyable,"I really enjoyed this book. The writing style is very different from American mysteries, and I enjoyed that. Chief Inspector Chen is investigating the murder of a political party member and it's interesting to see the pull between politics and doing what Chen believes is right. Chen is a character that grew on me. From the start he's very poetic, and the way he views the world around him is poetic too. Normally I'm not big on poetry, but there were a lot of nice quotes in this book, and Chen had a way of making them fit his life. The pace of the book was very relaxed, not a usual fast paced mystery. I liked that. There was a concentration on details and relationships and it was interesting to read about the changes that were affecting China in the 1990s. Like others have said, it wasn't really about finding out who the killer was, but the journey that Inspector Chen took, and the discoveries he made along the way, as well as his perserverance."
3,Pleasant but sometimes aimless,"This is a basic mystery, with a plot that's very linear with few surprises; thus it's mainly a story of two men overcoming the system around them, a bureaucracy of Red China with the accompanying human foolishness that goes with impersonal, bureaucratic pretense. The characters are its main strength, with the exception of the female lead, who is introduced too late in the story. Its pacing is exciting in that every event is a deadpan, with the conclusion announced early, and then focus building around how it is overcome. Quotes from mostly Chinese poets throughout build a sense of metaphor and background that is both random and highly focused. While it is verbose and often meanders, this is a pleasant book which focuses more on revealing people than mysteries."
5,What a debut!,"Qiu Xialong, in this brilliant debut, weaves gourmet food and poetry into what is at heart a crime novel. The mystery fiction that I enjoy the most has two key features: a well-developed reflective protagonist and the writing captures social mores of the time that it was set in. Xialong succeeds at both admirably. The novel is set in China of the early nineties. Through his insightful descriptions of a rich web of relationships, even a naive reader can start to appreciate the unspoken rules that govern social conduct. What seems foreign and incomprehensible at first, starts to become accessible! And then there are universal themes of courage and filial duty that will resonate regardless of circumstance and culture. There is a depth and vitality that I found really satisfying, there are no cheap or gimmicky flourishes."
3,Very Contemporary,"It is not often that you get to read a crime novel where the criminal and his accomplice are executed. But this is China. The book is heavy in its flavour but the insight into the Chinese way of life in the early 1990s, after Tiananmen was excellent - the disparate living conditions between the classes and a society in flux. Unfortunately, the book (at least the version that I had), had some inconsistencies like sometimes the place is a college, somtimes institute; sometimes Riverside Cafe, sometimes River Cafe. Otherwise, the pace is slow perhaps reflective of how bureaucracy is in play and swift when things do happen."
5,Love the Pattern,I love these plates! Got rid of all my heavy dishes that took up so much space and bought these. I love how light they are and how much less space they take up. Their so pretty too. Very pleased with this purchase.
3,Disappointed in the quality,"Purchased 4 of this size for guitar building plus a set of Stew-Mac smaller versions. You can certainly see the quality difference when comparing the two. Although these work just fine, I don't like how sloppy the fit is for the moveable piece. It requires extra effort just to align the jaws."
5,great clamps,I build guitar and do woodworking. These claps are a great deal and work very well. They release guickly and the cams are good.
3,Great idea for an important book - but struggles to engage,"I really wanted to read about fraud in science. It is an important topic, which should interest most of us, not least those who research. And, there are interesting stories told here indeed, and much to think about. I especially enjoyed reading about the Baltimore case. And, I can think of many reasons to discuss the potential problem with current science funding and system for academic recognition. Personally I find that this book has plenty enough of information to deserve more stars than some reviewers give it here at Amazon.However, I too found that the book lost energy after a while, the same arguments were repeated, the analysis seemed a bit thin, but the pages long.Fraud in science is interesting stuff, and I was a little sad to admit to myself I was getting bored. Please someone, follow-up with a deeply researched and detailed account of later cases, and dare to discuss more the motives of fraud."
1,"Judson would be a demagogue, if he could get your attention.","I would have given this no stars if it were an option.The first 20 pages of this book bored and insulted me. Judson drones on about every fraud known to mankind, but only occasionally scientific fraud. He seems to hope that if we hear enough examples of fraud in the world, we will get fired up and join him in a lynching.His tone is condescending and assumes that you already agree with him. This is not the type of academician that you could hope to have a meaningful conversation with. He laces his information with references to ""the epidemic"" of fraud and nobody being ""immune"" to it, as if by the weight of these descriptive terms you will be swept into his inevitably correct conclusions. I suspect that Judson would have presented a more objective book if he had more worthwhile information to offer."
1,The Great Boredom,"Judging by the title, I was expecting a very interesting book. However, after only a few pages, my eyes began to glaze over. With all the possible material to choose from, the author chose to focus on the ""Baltimore Affair."" I had never heard of this ""affair"" before, but now know that I didn't miss much. The entire book is written more in the dry style of a academic paper than one for the general reader. While it may appeal to some insiders in the research community, to capture any wider audience the author needed to inject some spirit, graphic images, personalities, atmosphere, humor, drama, or anything into his account to spark some reader interest. Fraud in science is a great idea for a book, but the author having grabbed the ball...dropped it."
4,Great for dry mouth!,"I'm a nurse and work with a lot of people suffering from dry-mouth. I bought these to carry around in my bag to hand out to my patients. They are sour enough to initiate salivation without being as sour as some of the children's candies you get in the drugstore, which make you want to spit them right back out. I also like that they are lollipops, which are safer for my patients who would be at risk for choking on a small hard candy left in their mouth."
3,Sugar Free Sour Lollipops,"These lolli's are good, they just taste like regular lolli's, maybe a little sour. I personnally would not buy them again, I thought 50 lolli's would be a lot, but for $17 (incl s/h) it really isn't very much and not worth the price."
4,Nice Bible,"The paper could be better , some wrinkles but no big deal .the cover is more like the third pic over on the pics of it ."
3,pics,The bible that came looks NOTHING like the pictures online. I ordered bible tabs based on the colors in the picture and now the tabs don't match the bible.
5,Fantastic!,"Great Bible. In it I learned that I was dead in my sins and that by faith alone in the finished work of Jesus on the cross, all my sins woud be forgiven and I would have eternal life! Can't beat that with a stick!"
4,An odd need,"I like to read the Bible and meditate while I use my tread mill. This Bible has font size and contrast that allow me to easily read while I walk. It is wonderful. I would also recommend it to those who have vision problems--my mother-in-law was not able to read her ""large"" print bible in her last years, but I think she could easily have read this one."
5,Large print Bible,"Though I would prefer a soft cover Bible, this one is great for those of us who need a larger print."
3,Important Textbook for African American Psychological Experience,"I don't like the format of the book. It is very dense with headings. But for the most there aren't any pictures of concepts. It's mostly text. Not to say that the African American experience within psychology isn't important, it is very much so, the format of the textbook makes it harder for me to read it. Because it is so much text based I am deterred, because it is like reading a book with small text. I used and will use this textbook as apart of my psychology major. It's hard for me to read large amounts because of the format of the chapters. But this is certainly needed within the field of psychology, no question about that. This textbook is or can be useful for college students, graduate students, and professors, as well as anyone else interested in the subject."
1,Too elementary,"Not enough in depth information. I ordered this book as soon as I purchased Keynote, but by the time it came (one week later) I already knew everything the book covered! The section on charts is a joke! It tells you nothing! Very disappointing."
3,Good but not quite complete,"This collection is for the most part excellent. Most kindle versions for this price do not include illustrations, so I loved being able to see them. However, Huckleberry Finn is not complete and just stops in the middle of Huck and Tom trying to free Jim and I had to buy another version of that story to finish it. At the price offered it's still a good buy.For the compiler, Huck Finn is missing Chapters 36 and onward."
1,Utter nonsense,"If I had known this was a self-published book, I would not have bought it. It turned out to be shallow and freaky--homemade mythology and faceless characters. It is also much more gory than necessary. When somebody scooped an eyeball out, I almost quit reading."
5,IVP Bible Background Commentart,"I find that as a teacher of a Bible class, this book helps me teach my students (no mater what age) what it was like back then and I am able to explain what the Bible verses mean. It is a wonderfull book, A must if you want to know what the LORD is saying"
4,Good Resource,"This book is an overall necessity for every Bible student. I really like the way the author laid out the information in this volume. Although, I would have preferred more details, this is an important source!"
4,Some more good rock to please your ears...,"The only thing it's missing is a single they released for an alternative sampler cd called ""Spit You Out""...it's a shame really, cause it's easily their best song..download it and see what I'm talking about.. Anyway, good band, hope to see more by them. Favorite song on THIS cd is When You Lie."
3,When will the unoriginallity end?,"Yep, this is just another mediochre band trying to ride the wave of commercial modern rock success. As if Nickelback hasn't released a new album every other month to sate those who soak up this kind of music.All I can say is that it is a ""decent"" album.There is absolutely nothing new or unique about this band. The lyrics might as well be copied directly from the likes of Hinder and Breaking Benjamin."
3,"b-list ""modern"" rock","'coming up for air' is the absolute definition of a poor man's hard rock classic. All the energy, style and riffage of your favorite mainstream band has been re hased (poorly) and served up fresh with a side of unoriginality. The hooks are b-side esque for a band like breaking benjamin, smile empty soul would laugh at zero's attempt to convey one lyrically, and edgewater would be down right offended by the knock-off vocal patterns and pitches. For all of this though, MDZ still do right by their up and coming (bullet 336?) label, giving us 13 listenable, albeit barely, modern rock songs. Painfully average and always a step behind, Modern Day Zero are the poor man's next big thing."
3,A Tango Flavour with a Hint of Speghetti Western,"The Tango Saloon are an Australian based group featuring a cast of musicians coming from such diversebackgrounds as Monsieur Camembert, Mr. Bungle, Mike Nock, Jackie Orszaczky, Secret Chiefs 3 and Darth Vegas. The only way to describe this recent release on Ipecac Recordings(Mike Patton's US Label)is like an accident prone scientist stumbles apon a substance that speeds up motion and turns the world topsy turvy he tests it on an assortment of muscians with hilarious results.As with most Ipecac releases a few listens is required but let these amazing muscians take you around the world with many stops and tempo shifts along the way"
2,Great game but the bar broke off the pad within 2.5 wks of use,"The metal game pad is great except that the bar that was welded onto the pad broke off because of poor/weak welding at the joint, after only about 2 weeks of regular use. For this reason it certainly isn't worth the $150 paid."
4,Still very good,"The second in a series for Hartwell. Once again he gathers an eclectic group of Science Fiction writers that cover a wide variety of sub-sections to the genre. He has included two tributes to science the fiction forefathers Well and Verne. My personal favorite of this anthology was 'The Bride of Elvis', a tongue and cheek look at a religion developed around the death of the King. I also loved 'Counting Cats in Zanzibar' by Gene Wolfe. A robot story about a contract killing. If you are looking for easy reading that can also provoke thought, this is a good place to start."
4,"I'd rather like it to be ""Month's best SF""","It opens with a tribute to H.G. Wells and ends with an homage to Jules Verne.In the middle are 18 more stories that span from side to side of the SF spectrum and, even though they might not be all in the reader's preferences, are sure worth reading, if not thought-provoking. Talking about preferences, I can't help mentioning Terry Bisson's ""In the upper room"" and Damon Knight's ""Life edit"" as the best of the lot. Look forward for number 3, and 4, and..."
1,Fram? Are you kidding?,"Fram filters are notoriously the worst performing filter on the market. They have cardboard end caps, plastic bypass valves, nearly nonexsistant drain back valve. Why would you trust a high reving performance machine like a street bike to the cheapest made filter on the retail market. No thank you."
5,Good filter,This was a filter for my Honda Shadow. Fram filters seem of quality construction And service was amazingly fast. Anazon Prime is the way to go on items like this or things you would have to drive around and search for.
3,Just ok.,"Not enough detailed information. Needs more pictures, more examples. Otherwise the info is good and all aspects of what you need to know are covered. Just be prepared to be frustrated when you can't figure things out by the limited picture drawings. This book needs a serious overhaul."
5,Shipped carefully,"I can't rate the book itself, as it was a present. However, it was shipped very carefully and timely. It was bubble wrapped and both the front and back of the envelope read ""fragile"". Almost had me wondering if the book was made out of glass :)"
4,Keeping it simple,Nice easy-reading explanations.Good drawings and pictures to fill in the details.Would recommend.
2,Horrible,"I was so excited to get this due to back pain after long nights as a nurse. It's a great design, but I only got to use it a few times before the bags inside completely fell apart. I had beans everywhere! I never, ever laid on my back while using it, and I was very careful. I should have returned it."
4,Leave out the 'relaxing herbs',"I would have given this wrap 5 stars if only they hadn't put in the relaxing herb fragrance. Not everyone likes the same aromas and after awhile they just get annoying, smelling them while it's wrapped near your neck. I love the fact that it holds the heat for a long time. I hope the fragrance fades over time."
1,Terrible,The beads clump up and feel like little baseballs on my back. Very unconfortable. I wish I could find those apallo gell packs. They are the best I have ever used. I can't find them any more.
1,Aroma alert!,"Maybe a one-star rating isn't fair for a product I never tried, but I couldn't get this thing back in its plastic wrapper fast enough lest the perfumed, ""aromatherapy"" odor overwhelm my home. I imagine that in the middle ages they must have doused themselves with this sort of stuff to conceal body odor and onion breath. The emergency maneuver I performed to stuff the thing back in its bag, the bag in the box and the box in the mail could easily have made my back even worse, but it would have been in a good cause. I think I've made myself clear.If you don't have any sense of smell--who knows?--this thing, whose size and shape is a great idea, might actually work."
4,Nice moist heat wrap,"Nice hefty weight to this products adds to the conforting effects. Hook and loop(velcro) patches for case enclosures and also to keep the inner packs seated in place. I have not tested the wash-ability yet. But for fit form and function as described in the product marketing it does what I expected.Toss it in the microwave for a few minutes and it's moist and steamy. The only downside for me is the aroma. The clover mainly and slight eucalyptus is what fills my microwave for a little while after I heat this up. I usually toss this onto a plate, heat it and then leave the microwave open to air out while I use this. I've had no residual issues doing that. Other than that, it does what i need and the weight makes it a good purchase for me."
5,It's the best,"I have arthritis in my back, neck and hips. I try not to take much pain meds. Once this wrap is all nice and toasty and I sit down I slide the pack down my back and lean back on my chair. I honestly do not feel any back pain for hours until I stand. I use it at times on my hips when laying down and it does help some.I am sure anyone who has pain will try anything to be pain free. this product is a winner and I am considering purchasing a second one to use against my hip while seated.This also helps warm the body."
2,Doesn't quite do it...,"There are small heat packs inside the wrap, so it actually doesn't have any positive effect on my shoulders (there are packs in the two parts that go over your shoulders, then none on top of your shoulders, then packs a couple inches down your back). Plus it smells pretty badly and doesn't get as hot as other wraps I've owned. :("
2,This is a cam?!,"I bought this because it advertised as good quality and was cheap. After using it, I can honestly say the color is terrible and it tends to freeze often. The only reason it gets a two is because I can somewhat reconize myself in the pictures."
1,Kensington SVGA hot deal.,"I bought the Kensington SVGA for 29.99 that seem to be a hot deal.The sell guy told me not to use any of the software deliver with the unit. Only use what is on the manufacturer site. That was a good advise (trust me).After goning to the complexe installation with the most up to date software, I discover that the built in microphone is not workink in netMeeting.My rating is nice hardware and totaly useless software.The product is not made any more, the last software update is 2 yesr old...At 30$us it is an acceptable deal for a camera only configuration. At 60 or more it is a terrible deal."
4,Does not work with XP,"I used this camera with Win 95, Win 98 and Win 98 ME and it worked fine.The only problem I have is that the CABO II file is not compatable with Win XP"
3,May work with MAC,I was able to use this camera with my MAC and even in ichat! Just need to search the web for the thrid party drivers.
2,Needs better software support.,"I bought this camera because I saw it had drivers for Linux and, as a last resort Windows. After I got it I saw the sticker on the box that said ""SVGA version only compatible with Win98"". That didn't make me happy as I run 2000. The linux drivers are a pain but I've made it work a few times...just long enought for it to crash my linux box...so beware. However, it feels like nice construction and the image quality seems decent. If you can get it to work for you, it'd be a nice camera. Unfortunately for me, it's just not that reliable. I'll be getting a real video camera and a capture card instead (rock solid)."
4,Works fine for me.,"Having WIN98 SE the camera works great for me, pictures are sharp. On another puter with WIN2000 it didn't work.Only wish the manual came with better instructions like camera features..its suppose to have a build in mike, and what does the top button do? Anything? As for software I prefer my friends Logitech software better. However for $49.95 CND its way cheaper than in the USA, go figure. A headset with mike is the way to go."
4,Beautiful book,"Ann Pember did a fabulous job with this book, the only negative thing I would say is that the cover is misleading. They say step by step, and feature the dahia, which is what I wanted to paint. They don't show details about this particular flower. It's fine, and she had lots of great instructions, but that flower is really why I bought the book. I do love her work."
4,An Absolute MUST for the Mexican-American War Researcher!,"As you can tell by the title, this isn't a book to be read, but a resource for discovering other titles relating to the Mexican-American War. Though because of its age many newer titles on this subject are not included, the vast amount of original, first-person information recounted within Mr. Tuturow's book makes it worth the expense. (Lucky me, I got mine as a gift!)"
5,"Five stars, with gusto!","I cannot say enough about ""The Emotional Revolution""! Dr. Norman Rosenthal has compiled an astonishing amount of cutting edge clinical research and history, combined this information with his clinical expertise, and morphed it into a comprehensible book loaded with astute insights and practical advice you can use every day. One of the more remarkable elements of his writing is his ability to synthesize massive amounts of highly technical brain research into easily understandable text, so you really KNOW what's going on with your brain when you are sad, happy, relaxed, or angry. He then uses examples, vignettes and very specific behavioral guidelines to show you what simple steps you can take to lead a happier, healthier life. Dr. Rosenthal's brilliant, seamless, sensitive, writing will educate, fascinate, and benefit all who are fortunate to read it. Five stars, with gusto!"
5,A very good product indeed,"My wife and I found this product and just had to buy it! It has loads of features and abilities that are easy to use even for someone who is not to aquainted with a computer. It has helped us save quite a bit of money and at the same time let us be creative with the memories of our childrens progress through life. It is simply a must have for any parent looking to save some money while being creative and original, without ripping their hair out."
5,Excellent Piece Of History,"Gemini programm was the one who attracted my interest in manned spaceflight for my life. There is a lot of books you can read with full information on the project but nothing can compare to the visual experience. This DVD is complete, excellently put together, quality is marvelous, I went through it in two sessions - you simply cannot stop! Highlights are definitely Ed White's and Buzz Aldrin's spacewalks and of course Gemini 6 and 7 rendezvous.I just hope there will be the similar coverage of the Mercury available soon.However, there are two comments for improvement. First is silent spacecraft instrument panel footage - you really cannot enjoy it fully without accompanying sound. Second is missing Atlas ATDA launch coverage.But this is really just a minor issue, this material is a must for every manned spaceflight enthusiast."
4,For The Hardcore Aerospace Fan,"Ok, I'm a geek and really get into watching the raw footage of Gemini and Apollo. I do however watch some segments at 8x or even 16x, if there is no audio during the segment. Watching the Gemini capsule station keep and then dock to an Agena in real time or the film of the Gemini instrument panel is like watching grass grow. A less than hardcore fan will enjoy the project overview on disc 1 but may fall asleep watching the rest of the material.Gemini is the red-headed step child of the early space program. But without it, we would have never made the 12-31-69 deadline for ""landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth."" Rendevouz, docking, extra vehicular activity, digital mission computers and fuel cells are only some of the accomplishments of the Gemini program that lead directly to the success of Apollo."
2,Could have been much better.,Some of the women in this movie are very attractive but most of the movie has no sound. Could have been made much better.
1,Waste of film and time,"If you ever watch the documentary S&Man you'll become familiar with Bill Zebub and the people who make these types of absoulutley gutter punk unredemable, underground indie horror films. Really don't waste your time. I'm a fair fan of exploitation art. This is just empty space. There's nothing there to hang your hat on. No story, no talent at all. The photography and quality of the production don't even offer anything. Believe me that I'm not offended at all by good dirty explotation fun. I'm offended by the fact that hacks like this even have the gall to release such untalented unimaginative trash. I truly do implore you to skip this because you'll never be able to get that precious time you wasted back. Watch Cannibal Holocaust instead."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I think this movie, although very reasonably priced, was a waste of my money and time to watch it. Very dry and boring."
1,Boring,"It was a boring movie with way less than good looking or pretty girls, someone discribed the womes as gothicwell if its gothic in a plain ugly way then oh ya."
1,I Told You Not To Call The Police,"This movie was very confusing. The story rambled and had very little merit. Another Bill Zebub loser and another DVD to take up room, rather than to be enjoyed."
1,Never again!!,I give this movie an 1 star and if I could give it an lower mark than I would-just terrible.
4,Learn to appreciate North American Native culture,"This book is laugh-out-loud funny, mostly because Johnston shows us how simple events cause misunderstandings between white and Native North American Native cultures. These short stories are fictional, but are wonderful ways to learn about and appreciate North American Native culture (the stories are set in Canada) without being preachy."
4,Don't beat the clock!,i liked this story and it was good but not that scary actually it was the first book i've ever read. i read it first when i was 10 years old and i enjoyed it.
2,BORING,I did not like this story because it was pretty dull. It did not have the best details and it had no pictures. You should be able to see what the events are like. For a scary story this very very pedestrian. I don't think that a bird would scare me. If it was a lot of evil birds it would be different. So I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody.
3,Cuckoo Clock Of Doom,"I did not like the book much because no one got in fights only the bird did. In one of the parts the bird bit the kid in the neck because he choked the poor bird and time keeps repeating itself. I think that the book was not that good but it did not have a good ending because it did not have humor at all it was not a very good book it sort of left you thinking about the ending . by,Jose soto gomez book by R.lstine"
3,YIKES!,"If you are looking for the ORIGINAL Goosebumps Cuckoo Clock of Doom, BEWARE! You will be ""doomed"" if you buy this one by mistake, and may even feel you are going ""cukoo!"" But if you WANTED the short TV version, you will be very happy! Just pay more attention to the full title than I did.... By the way, not the seller's fault!"
4,correct,this is the correct replacement item for the item in which needed replacing. coleman is a solid brand name and therefore purchasing coleman brand replacement parts is the only way to go. i had no problem with the seller.
2,Good bulbs bad battery,Probably a good product. The bulbs fit perfectly in my lantern but my lantern still did not work. It must be an issue with the rechargeable battery.
3,Good...but not great,"""En Toute Intimité"" is mostly a compilation of songs from ""Nue"" and ""Pure,"" with a few new songs. These newer songs are mostly Italian, Josh Groban-esque songs that are rather different from her usual work. The songs from her other CDs are accompanied by a piano or violin and are more mellow than the original versions. In the song, ""S'en Aller,"" Lara sings with a nasally, childish voice at the end, which, in my opinion, ruins the entire song. While I am always impressed with Lara's talent (and it is evident in this album), this CD is not one of her best."
5,...and I don't speak French!,"I bought this based on a review I read here from someone who said he speaks no French but loved this anyway. On faith, I did the same - bought it, and have really loved it -- Lara could sing my grocery list and make a symphony of it. Even if you speak no French, you'll really enjoy watching her in this small intimate concert, where she sings in Italian, French, and even English. She is one gorgeous woman!"
5,Possibly the best live concert ever,"My wife and I agree that Lara Fabian is the best French language singer alive, and that includes other greats, even Celine Dion. Unlike Celine's, Lara's voice is richer and equally tantalizing in the lower ranges as in the higher ones. The emotion in her interpretations also stands above all others. We had the pleasure of seeing her live in Brussels a few years back, and I am eager to have her do a US tour. In fact, I'd be prepared to go to Canada just to see her live again. If you want to buy a single Lara Fabian record, ""En Toute Intimite"" should be it."
4,lara fabian live,"to me, lara fabian with her unique spontenuous and true voice is better heard live! tracks 3, 9, 12 very very good. caruso by lara fabian is a must hear"
5,Marvelous,"Lara Fabian does it again, bringing us one of the best albums of the year. She shows us her soul, her magnitude, as she goes from pop to jazz to opera. Do not miss her magnific rendition of Addio del passato!"
2,I didn't like it at all.,"I was very excited to see this film after reading about it. A couple of years ago, I considered possibly purchasing it. I try to watch the good films that come from Greece.I finally ordered it from NetFlix and really didn't like it at all. I found it to be extremely boring. I was actually happy when the movie ended, so I could send it right back.I don't typically have a problem with slow moving films - even Tarkovsky's stuff - and many of my favorites can be described in that way.I'm sure there are plenty of people who will like this movie, but I'm not one of them. I think two stars for Rouleman is pretty fair on my part.I'd say don't purchase this film unless you've already seen it and liked it."
5,Escada,"This is my favorite cologne, and I have received many comments about the how good it smells. I Love it!"
2,Jr.Baseball,Got this for 3yr. old for x-mas. Very dissapointed. Poorly made. Bases are made of a thick paper. Some were bent when opened package. They cracked when we tried to smooth out. No directions for Tee stand. Does not stay upright and collapses often when we play. The velcro hand mitts come apart too. My daughter doesn't seem to care. I guess I should have expected this for $[...]. I would not buy this product again.
4,Just as Promised,I have this book on my sewing reference shelf and I've already used it several times when altering patterns. The service from the seller was excellent and the book arrived in the time promised and was the condition as promised also.
5,Best Sewing Book...Period,"This was my main sewing textbook throughout college. I have the third Edition (1975) and I've long since lost the dustcover but it's what's in the book that matters. Where are you going to find detailed instructions on womens and mens tailoring in one complete book? After all these years, it's still my go to book."
2,Not a Jorgensen,"I've beem a woodworker for many years and let me tell you, if you are expecting the quality of a Jorgensen clamp, then dont buy these. I bought two sets of these and made only one clamp after seeing the quality. They are inexpensive for a reason, however they are better than nothing if you can't afford the Jorgensen."
2,Home & Business Lawyer,"This product isn`t really what I expected. The Wills I printed out were nine pages long, and difficult to make out. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn`t have purchased it. But that`s only my opinion, someone else might find it to be very useful."
2,Misrepresentative of features,"No online support of product and this was not stated upfront! although adjustments on the price was made. The impression I got, was since you complained we (company) will do something about it. No complain (company) we will wait and see. I can not give a rating any higher than a two and that is stretching it."
3,Awfull Translation,"I had the original in French, and got the English version trying to understand it faster. I was very dissapointed when I found phrases as:""The puddle is the seat of a certain internal pressure p_2>0""A puddle being a seat? I just don't catch the metaphore. The original in french says,""Il existe une certaine pression interne p_2>0""Which is, as you can googletranslate, ""There is some internal pressure p_2> 0""."
4,Great for starting,"I was searching for a second pad for playing in pairs with StepMania.This one is better than the one I get from my game store.I use a converter (The recommended one from StepMania site) from Play Asia to play on my Mac and on a PC:Dual Shooter (EMS USB2)EMSCompatible with PlayStation2(tm), Windows(tm) PCNow I'm having real fun.This product is just for start.Kids really enjoy it.You should be careful not to use shoes but has great materials for the price.This is very similar to the pad I bought from a game store but has better quality in the pins (connector). The one I had has poor quality in the connector so I thought It was broken; what it really needed was to move a little the connector and it works. But this one has no connector problems. I recommended this one."
4,DDR Dance Mats,I bought this for my daughter who was pleasantly surprised when she opened this on Christmas Day. The dance mats are larger than the basic ones and of much better quality.
2,not made in USA,"American Power Pull #15002 3 Ton Power PullerAlthough some sites say this cable puller in made in the USA and the company site leads you to believe it's made in the USA, it is made in China and the workmanship sucks. I'm sending it back because I would not trust it to be safe."
1,cheap import knock-off,Skip this knock-off and get the high-quality puller from Wyeth-Scott instead. Having seen both (and owned the Wyeth-Scott 3-ton that I keep in my Land Cruiser) I can say that they look sort of the same but this one is seriously lacking in quality by comparison.
1,"Actually 4 ton, and is made in China","T. Choj's review is correct - this puller is made in China (I called American Power Pull). Also, the Amazon listing shows it as 3 ton, but American Power Pull's site lists as 4 ton. I was considering buying until I found out it is made in China."
5,Great sequel. Extraordinary attention to details.,"One wouldn't think of a book like this to be the life-changing kind. But it can be. I read this books a few years ago, getting a copy in the strangest of ways. I read the first book and loved it. But this one is something else. Little I would know that I'd find myself on a trip to India and learning japanese fencing and solving Zen koans inspired partly by it. A very impressive close to the story, and I certainly regret there is no third installment on the series, for it would make a hell of a story. Historic timeline is sharply set aside, but it takes a history freak to check all the details out, so most people won't notice. Even better than the first, and the emphasis on spiritual experiences and growth is more marked in this book. The end is majestic and adequate to a marvelous saga. I almost hope to find a reference to a wandering japanese monk in Shea's next series: Saracen. It wouldn't be too hard."
5,"Spectacular, But...","I'm confused...is there a 3rd book to this series or not? If so, what's its name?"
3,Its not that good.,"This book was decent and somewhat interesting. The details are too few and the characters set at extremes or stereotypes. Many important events take place as silly coincidences and their is no real feeling for the novel. The descriptions leave much to be desired. Also all of these ""strong"" people weep constantly, are unsure of themselves, and break down in despair.Clavelle's Shogun far surpasses this book. It gives you a real feeling for medeival Japan and an understanding of the culture of the time period. I know that Shike takes place before this but it does not do the same thing for its setting that Shogun does. Both books include a foreign main character trying to make his way in Japan and Shogun is the far more compelling novel."
5,This is a must-have book for anyone that reads!,"A friend of mine found this book at a library book sale for a dollar! She let me borrow it, and I couldn't put it down. It had both parts one and two combined, so it was over 700 pages! I've never read anything over 350, but the struggles of Taniko and Jebu were just too much to let go. I've missed sleep reading until 3am. This was a wonderful book!"
3,Don't work with 7.62X54R,These are great ammo boxes but did not work that great for me. I purchased them for 7.62X54R. The rim of this ammo is wider than a 308 round. This extra width forced me to have to store the ammo with the primer up and now it rattles in the box. I still use it but would prefer something that fit better.
2,"It's cheap, it works.","The Kensington VideoCAM VGA is a passible desktop cam for webcam or videoconferencing, but you can do better with almost any of Logitech's QuickCam models.Connected to Mac G4, its primary role is as a webcam. It's grainy and has a tendancy to blur movement under typical office lighting. OTOH, it was cheap, and is quite small -- it's footprint is about two inches wide and three quarters of an inch deep, so it can perch almost anywhere.PROS: Small, decent software, acts as a proper QuickTime device and so works with almost any video software.CONS: Grainy picture, doesn't handle low-light conditions very well, software pretty but limited.VERDICT: It does the job, but not impressively. Consider a higher quality cam if your budget allows, but if not, you could also do worse."
2,not good enough,Price is low and so is the quality. Don't waste your money on this one. Spend a few more dollars and get one with better resolution.
3,Great Item For The Cost!,Although this is not one of the greatest digital Camera's out there it is a very good camera for its price!
1,nice watch without function,We are not happy with this watch because the watch was without function after a bid more than four weeks
4,Like reading the New York Times Sunday magazine,"As both authors are press people, it is not surprising that the most consistent criticism of this book is the lack of context and background. It is often said that news writers sacrifice the larger picture for the sake of detail. That also applies to news writers doing history.That said, this is a damn good book, primarily because of the details. For those thinking the account is too New York centric (after all the two authors come from the New York Times), all I can say is that the contributions from places other than New York and San Francisco (such as Minnesota and Miami) are acknowledged.However for me the biggest elephant in the room for this book is the almost total neglect of the news and popular media's role in the shaping of the gay movement. I always thought newspaper people like to talk about their business. But it seems that the authors prefer the ""fly on the wall"" position. And I think that is a bit dishonest."
3,Normandy travel review,"NormandyI bought this DVD in anticipation of visiting Normandy and thought the DVD would be helpful. The DVD shows highlights of Normandy, but I found Rick Steve's DVD on Normandy to be more comprehensive and informative."
4,Un roman sur l'amour,"Ce roman décrit l'histoire tourmentée de Séverine Sérizy. Joseph Kessel peint de manière admirable le difficile divorce entre le coeur et la chair, entre son vrai, immense et tendre amour pour son Mari Pierre et l'exigence implacable des sens. Nous portons tous en nous ce conflit, chaque homme et chaque femme qui a aimé longtemps. Chez Séverine, il ne sommeille pas mais il déchire sa vie. Cet antagonisme peut paratre banal et maintes fois décrit dans la littérature (pensons à ""Madame Bovary"") mais Joseph Kessel a choisi une situation exceptionnelle ce qui donne à son roman un degré d'intensité remarquable"
4,Very Motivational in Small Doses,"As the author of [...], I am very familiar with being a ""creative brain"" type person. I've had this book for quite a while and recently grabbed it off the shelf. I'll admit that there are a lot of ideas to absorb...a little bit of reading is all I can take at any given time. However, what I really like about this book is that it is very motivational.When reading the ""Do The Hustle"" Chapter, I was pumped up by the sheer energy the author puts into giving examples of why creative people like me should keep going no matter what. This chapter alone makes the book a winner to me. Creative types are notorious for being sensitive and allowing the world (and naysayers) to rain on our parade. Whenever you feel like you may never make it - I would suggest reading a chapter from this book. Persistence, baby. That's the key to eventual success."
2,Couldn't read it,There may have been something life changing in this book but I could not make it very far. I think this book is out of date. There are many other how to books that are much better.
3,Self-Promotion for the Creative Person: Get the Word Out About Who You Are and What You Do,I didn't relate to this book as an illustrator. For my profession I hoped that the author was more helpful.
3,"Has some good ideas, but appears to be outdated",Many of the ideas were good. But because the book was published a while ago it is not quite as relevant as it could be. There are better and newer books out there.
4,Baby steps for procrastinators,"I'm a procrastinator, and a creative person, not the best combination for success. Lee Silber makes promoting yourself simple, easy and fun. And the babysteps, microsteps makes procrastination a thing of the past. Read this book and start having the best career possible."
3,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"This is another book that caught my eye because of the title, but when I received the book it didn't have the type of information I was hoping to read up on.This book was too scattered for me. I put it down after a few days and don't plan on going back to it."
2,Save Your Money,"Nothing really new or enlightening in this book. Many contradictions. For example, in one section the author suggests you produce what the market wants. In another, they insist that an artist stay true to their own passions. They suggest using unusual clothing as a hook, then berate someone they know for wearing an outdated hat. Particularly unhelpful for fine, visual artists (painters, photographers, etc.) Most examples given cite those who have already ""made it"" breaking into new fields, but once someone's ""made it,"" they're virtually shoved into dozens of new fields (actors writing books, singing, etc.) Author also suggests using famous people you know to get ahead, as though everyone has a bevvy of famous friends. Author suggests contacting such people, but doesn't tell how this is achieved with any success whatsoever.All of this has been said before...a million times...and better, too. Save your money for your own self-promotion efforts."
4,This is your parent's hardcore!,"It's so good to hear 7 Seconds as gown men carrying forward the ideals they championed as kids. Let's face it, they'll never be known as accomplished musicians, but few bands have ever shouted-out their opinions with as much conviction as these guys.Now that they're no longer lost trying to become the next REM or U2, the songs are stripped back to where they need to be. A great effort from a great band.7 Seconds remains young at heart and rock as hard as ever!!! Pick up this CD if you're over 30 and have ever been a fan of hardcore. It feels just like the '80s."
3,Good pad,It is still working over a year later. We get pretty rough with it and it is still working just fine the only thing is it slips after a while. It came with these foam stickers to put at the bottom of the mat but they don't work on carpet at all and just fell of. We bought this January of 2007 and it is still working today so its a good mat i think.
4,Great lens for the $,"I bought this lens Last year on the Tamron Student program. Its a nice lens. My first one had a problem that showed up in the first 3 days, it would not go from manual to auto focus. So I had to replace it. A hassle but still worth it. I liked the lens a lot and only sold it off to move up to the much sharper Canon 180mm L 3.5. If you are looking at a 90/100mm Macro or the 180, get the 180, its so much nicer. If you cant afford the Canon L series, get the Tamron! Its tons better than the sigma junk! And the 180 gives you some distance between you and the object, very nice esp if you are shoot an insect!!!! I have some images up at Tamron.com and if you have a tamron lens you can post images there too!"
2,The Trackball that doesn't.,I have tried two of the model 64227 Trackballs and each of them became erratic tracking in the vertical axis within a week of putting them in service. I like the layout of the device and it's programming features but trying to work in a graphics application is very frustrating to say the least. I can't recommend this item to anyone.
3,most comfortable and functional but short lived,"This is my favorite trackball, which is why I've put up with around ten of them breaking.Kensington stands behind the product and sends me new ones each time that they degrade to the point where I can't clean the rollers anymore, but the defect is still annoying. If only they had optical tracking instead of the mechanical rollers that collect dust and eventually become uncleanable.When it is working I enjoy the ergonomic comfort, which is better than any other Kensington trackball (TurboMouse, Orbit, etc.). I map the four buttons to different application shortcuts and also use the scroll wheel (although that gets pressed accidentially because of its position).In short it is a great product with one big flaw that means Kensignton will be replacing it every so often."
2,Constant cleaning ...,That's the only way to keep this trackball working. It does work smoothly when it's clean ... but it's very hard to keep it this way. I am amazed at how fast the rollers inside gum up - and the only way I have found to clean them is to gently and carefully scrape the crud off them with a sharp blade. There are also three tiny beads that hold the ball in place - these get covered in crud too. The only way to clean these is pop them out of their holders - very tricky.In general a nightmare cleaning effort. I have been on my hands and knees looking for these little beads many times when I have dropped them. I finally lost one and now the trackball is headed into the trash. My last duty is to give this review to warn you off it unless you have a good obsessive streak for cleaning (I don't).I also agree with the bland ambi-dextrous shaping. Doesn't really rest your wrist because of this.
4,The best?,"Let me count the ways it's so very good:- Four programmable keys- A hand-fit that's remarkably ergonomic, but also stylish- That great Kensington software that allows near-limitless customization- Easy navigation- Easy-to-use scroll ringIn fact (at least for my hands) this may be close to the perfect trackball. I noticed a considerable divergence of opinion in the reviews, but I suspect that the reactions would be unanimously positive if this were optical. As it is, fibers and dirt can clog the trackball; if left uncleaned too long, the damage might ruin your mouse. And while fairly smooth in operation, it's not close to Kensington's optical versions."
4,Orbit -- TurboBall,"Kensington Orbit wore out after some years. The natural replacement would be TurboBall. Same problem with the little rollers gumming up. It feels a little ""tall"" for me, but overall works well.Zero hassle install, extra buttons are nice, and the ""scroll wheel"" is great. Nothin fancy really just gets the job done..."
4,The little brother of the Expert,"A good track ball, especially for people with small hands. To bad they no longer make it"
3,Not as good as expert mouse,"I am a long time fan of kensington trackballs, but this one did not come up to snuff. The first one did not work. Kensington easily and promptly replaced it, but I soon found that on identical machines with identical settings, (I unplug my expert mouse and plug in the turbotrackball) that the performance was unexplainably sluggish."
3,Go Optical,When kept clean works well and is quite accurate. But seems to need constant cleaning so ball continues to track. The optical trackball does not have this problem.
1,Disappointed,Here it is 6 months later and it is cutting out on me already. This is a HUGE object. It takes up a lot of room. The ball is huge. It is a sad follow up to an Optical trackball. The buttons are LOUD when clicked. The scroll button is about the only thing I like on it. I would not buy another and wish I could give this one back.I know how to clean my equipment so that is not the issue.I think it is just inferior.
1,Way Too Large,This trackball is so large that I haven't even bothered to hook it up. However well it may or may not perform is outweighed by the amount of space it will take up.
3,"Good Music, Positive Message","This is a good album with a couple of very good songs.Stellar Kart has a sound that appeals to teenagers. They have a positive message. They are a Christian band and their lyrics reflect it. They are not afraid to use the name 'Jesus' in their music as so many others are. Their sound is pretty light, but very pleasant. The song 'Me And Jesus' is a standout here.If you want a good album to get a teenager and you don't want to have to worry about awful lyrics, this would be a good choice."
4,"Eye of the beholder, ear of the listener?","Music is an art and, like any other art, not everyone can agree on what's good. Stellar Kart isn't breaking any new ground with this album, but they don't have to! They're an upbeat Christian band that has fun playing and just wants people to enjoy their music. As with any album from any band, not every track is stellar (sorry, couldn't resist), but there's enough good songs to make me want to keep listening. Factor in clean lyrics and an important message, and I'd buy it over any number of other albums."
2,Bad Punk Rock,"""Me And Jesus"" is the best track on the album, with great lyrics, and the passion behind the song. Bad thing is the rest of the album falls into it's own formula, and one that you tire of VERY fast. Stop after five tracks, you've heard the basic sound. Creatively is badly needed on this album, change up the formula. The next album should be a complete departure from their first two albums, do hard rock, or no rock. Do something different. This isn't a sophomore slump, because their first album wasn't much better."
1,doesn't work for me....,i tried it several times. i left it on an area for about 20 minutes and the hair that came off was too little to be useful.
3,Why 'The essential Bernstein' is not conducted by Lenny?,"The pieces of music selected for this recording are indeed a selection of the 'Essential Bernstein'. The 60's ""Candide Overture"" is the best version recorded by Bernstein. But the ""West side Story"" is conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas (a good conductor, but there are several Bernstein-conducted recordings of the West Side Story score and symphonic dances). The same thing happens with some other pieces. If Leonard Bernstein recorded all of his compositions, I suppose the 'essential Bernstein' should have Bernstein conducted by Bernstein recordings."
4,Tamiya 35120 1/35 US M48A3 Patton Tank,"This tank was given to our 12 year old grandson for Christmas. We love the tank and the challenge, which he enjoyed, of putting it together."
5,Great Present for Grandson,We got this as a present for our grandson at Xmas. He reports that it's his favorite model and can't wait to finish it off.
3,"Monogram/Revell M48A2 Patton, Model Tank","This offering by Revell is a re-release of an old Monogram model. It depicts a US M48A2 Patton tank in 1/35 scale. The model is very inexpensive by today's prices. It is a fairly simple, straight-forward model to build, a fun kit for an adult and older pre-teen/teen to work on together. Only drawback is the two piece lower hull, which will require some care to assemble. Several soldiers are included and the kit can be built as part of a diorama."
3,Good,"I would recommend this series if you are a fan of KDrama's. The reason I am giving it 3 out of 5 is because it is like so many of the other KDrama's... Korean series tend to make women look silly , weak and overeaters.. Also, Kdrama's tend to make it seem like a crime if a woman wants to have a career, maybe that's a cultural thing but I dont get it. Also, A woman may start out strong but she ends up weak and dependent.. It's rare in a KDrama to see a woman be triumphant on her own and be strong from beginning to end.. Out of 20 Kdramas i have seen so far the closet i have ever seen to a strong woman througout was in the series ""Cinderella's Sister"" and "" Boys over Flowers, (Loved the latter).. This series i'm afraid is very typical, nothing to original and the ending is what you would expect.. So if you like Kdrama's this is for you... I keep watching them because they are sooo addictive!!!"
3,Great show but kinda pricey,I have to admit this was a great show. But is it worth $115? The photo of the box is a trick. It's not that thick. You get a thinner slip case with 2 DVD boxes in it. Look at the customer photos for a true view of the package.
3,"Not bad, beware of the double title","It's not bad, plenty of pictures. Just beware that ""Collapsibles - A Design Album of Space-Saving Objects"" published by Per Mollerup is EXACTLY the same book as ""Collapsible - The Genius of Space-Saving Design"" published by Per Mollerup. They have different covers but everything from the page numbers to what's on each page is EXACTLY the same. They appear as different books on Amazon.com so we bought both and were a bit annoyed that we ended up with two copies of the same book, just with different covers."
2,This performer stilted when compared to Martin Galling,"My opinion is subjective.....However, my introduction to these pieces aside from the notation was Martin Gallings interpretation of them- that's how I hear these pieces- and while Leonhardt may be gifted, No. 4 in dmin. just sounds awkward, like someone running with two left steps. If you can find Galling's harpsichord version grab it up and get me one too."
1,"Messy, messy, messy!","When I removed the cartridge from its shiny silver packaging, it was thickly covered in black toner ink, which got all over me, my clothing, and my carpet. I had to wipe it down before using it, fearing the thickness of the ink on the toner's exterior would do something to mess up my laser printer. I have to wonder how much ink that I paid for was on the exterior of the cartridge, and how this will affect the longevity of it. I would most likely not use this company again. What unprofessional slobs!"
2,"As advertised, but impractical to use","The Hisonic Waistband Voice & Speech Amplifier arrived two weeks after ordering, as advertised. It comes with headset microphone, collar-clip microphone, amplifier, strap and 6 re-chargeable AAA batteries.First, the good: the headset microphone works very well. The microphone ""stem"" is very flexible, yet stays in place. It amplified my whispering voice to an audible volume from up to 20 feet away.Now, the bad: the amplifier, with 6 batteries in it is very heavy. I wear a Blackberry on my waist already, so putting this on my waist made me look and feel like I was wearing a utility belt. In addition, the waist belt that comes with it is very large: adjusting it to the smallest circumference, it was still way bigger than my 29 inch waist. The ""loop"" that it hangs with on that belt is too small to fit a standard belt, so there are limited alternate options. The headset is not adjustable and seemed to move around on my head.I returned it."
3,Hisonic Waistband,"VOCAL FREQUENCY SEEMS TO BE THE KEY. WEARING IT MYSELF, IT WORKS FINE. My WIFE PUTS IT on(ORIGINAL INTENT), AND I GET NO Help WHaTSOEVER. The batteries that come with it are questionable as rechargeable, and I had to load mine up with store-boughtIN SHORT I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD TOOL FOR LECTURER, TEACHER, TOURIST QUIDE, ETC---BUT YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT IF IT WILL WORK WITH YOUR VOICE. I HAVE A FAIRLY STRONG SPEAKING VOICE THAT IS SOMEWHAT LOW PITCHED. SHE COULD PUT A HUMMINGBIRD ASLEEP--SWEET AND SOFT!!, AND I AM ABOUT 3/4 DEAF, TOO. WHAT'S NEXT--NEW WIFE OR NEW BOX??? mAYBE ONE OF THOSE OLD TIME CHEERLEARDER MEGAPONES!!"
4,Very good product,"This item works perfectly for small to moderate sized groups. It's an affordable alternative to a wireless fm signal amplified through a pa system. And if you clip the lapel mic onto an accoustic guitar, you've got an instant stage amp!"
4,Good backpack,"I have this backpack for my HP Elitebook 6930. This bag is a little bigger for my laptop(14.1""), but it has nice color, multiful function inside pockets. But I dont like the side pockets, one of which is designed too small. The other side pocket for water battle is a net pocket that I worried not strong enough for my battle. In whole, it is a very safe bag for computer, and nice looking too."
1,Bad service,"I ordered this item and first of all it was not exactly like the picture. The sleeve was just a black cuff, that I was willing to live with. Then I turned it on and it made a clicking noise but the hand did not move. Changed batteries and still no go. Quickly emailed seller via Amazon. They replied they would replace if after checking out a new one if I wanted. I sent a message of Yes..then I never heard from them, how to send the old one back or any advise as to what the next step was. I waited about 10 days, then it would be too late to receive it in time for Halloween. I sent an angry email and they responded telling me to call. After being put on hold for 10 minutes some one came on, I explained the situation and they asked me to hold, they came back and said I could keep the non-working hand and they would credit my account, they did not have any more. I found this service deplorable!! I will not order from them again no matter what they are selling."
1,Disappointing.,"The plot is far fetched & the ending weak. Cary Grant as usual does a good job. I don't think anyone but Betsy Drake could've played her role, but still I was disappointed in this movie, it doesn't grab you as all of Grants other movies."
3,Funny and a great song,"I thought this was vintage Cary Grant. Betsy Drake was, well, amusing and it is interesting that love really was in the air. Best of all the theme or main song in this movie has one of the greatest melodies, but very hard to remeber. What was the title? If you saw this movie I'm sure you loved it too."
5,For Carey Grant movie lovers!,"Oh my goodness, what a funny, silly, movie I thought I wouldn't watch a second time! However, it has this likeable quality, and simpleness that I can't resist! A cute Betsy Drake ( who later became Grant's wife I think ) is looking for a husband and sets her sights on Grant! The hilarity of how she does it and the wholesomeness of the characters, just make one wish for simpler times and values. Every now and then when I want to laugh at love and Betsy's fun character, I must watch this movie again ( four times so far )!!.... Plus, Grant plays his usual good-looking suave self, I have grown to love !"
3,"Not bad, but....","This film isn't bad in a lot of parts - the opening is great, and scenes like when a team takes down the flat (apartment) by placing charges against the wall in the adjacent flat were terrific. It also shows a lot of the SAS training going on.The film does drag in some parts.The US Army Ranger and the German GSG-9 characters were poorly portrayed - no Ranger would have that sort of long hair or be that unprofessional. But, hey, the film is about the SAS, not anybody else. Those two could have been left out.Overall, pretty good action flick that reminds of earlier times, earlier terrorism, etc....Worth watching..."
1,they cover looked like duplicate,The copy was not so good. Will not purchase from this place again. I did it only because I was pressured for time.
3,A little small...,I really like the ease in which you can just pop the heat pack into the microwave and in a few minutes it's hot and steamy. Also it's really nice that you can wash the cover separately. Only drawbacks are: the pack is a little small and really only heats the middle of an average adult's back. Would have been nicer if it was a few inches wider to cover more of the back. The wrap around portion that attaches in the front is too small for a size large man--won't hook in front.
5,Great Product,"I use this back warming wrap every night, I sleep with it all night. It has been very helpful with my low back pain."
3,"Nice wrap, terrible aroma","One of our friend bought this item and demonstrated it, it was quite useful for warming up aching backs. The aroma was also pleasant. We decided to buy the same from amazon. When we got it and used it, the aroma was not the same, it was not the aroma that we can sit with. It should be aroma-less, so it won't alienate anyone who is sensitive to some scents. Anyhow, 2 stars off for inconsistency. The smell was enough to relegate it to the back shelve in my bath closet."
3,Dry treatment of sometimes-interesting material,"This book reminds me of those PBS historical programs where a subject that COULD have been fascinating is made almost boring by a dry, academic style and too much repetition of basic info. The author often includes several versions of the same story to show how it spread around the USA, or even the world. It would have benefited from some astute editing."
5,galactico,"me gustaria saber si tienen en existencia los siguientes productos: Kensington ""TurboRing Trackball (PC/USB Mac) "" y tambien ""Turboball USB Trackball "" o en que tiempo los consiguen.una persona esta en los angeles (area de san. Fernando) y le pedi que me lo compre le voy a hacer llegar el telefono de ustedes, gracias de antemano por su tiempo. si me pueden dar el telefono de una tienda que estae cerca de ahi se los agradeceria."
3,Love Sean Patrick Flanery,This is not a blockbuster by any means..but I love Sean Patrick Flanery so it was worth watching just to look at him.
5,Your service,"DVD came early, which is super.God whose idea of sending them as gifts when there are several DVD movies in a package so I do not have to pay taxes for them danmark.Jeg are very happy with your service otherwise"
3,"the songs = 5 stars, this album only 3 stars",these are some great songs from anthrax past. Im giving it 3 stars because I think its average. It was good to hear the old songs done with the more modernized recording methods of today's standards. My beef with this album is the fact that anthrax sounds very tired on this album. Several of the songs are slowed down from the original formats. You can really notice it on `Caught in a mosh'. As well as `NFL'. You can also tell a difference with danny missing from some of these songs (the old lead guitarist). So what your left with is a shell of a band that once was about a decade ago. Still good stuff though.Just not energetic
3,Classic Antharx cuts are missing something this time,"I ignore what are this guys missing this time (maybe youth) because i feel music lack of originality, lack of intensity, ""lack of almost everything"" (as Eyehategod stated)is like this songs where before a gourmet dish and now Anthrax members prepared sandwishes with the doggie bag content and we are tasting again the lefts , I dont know exactly what it is but i didnt feel , that emotion i was used to feel for this guys work, is not that bad but Anthrax had offered better albums , maybe this is the last album i get from them , 2003 album ""we ve come for you all"" neither was that great with the exeption of a couple of tracks but i thougth that ""greater of two evils"" would be interesting because of the new perspective of Bush singing that songs before his age , and again i endeded wishing more.nothing left to sayHM"
1,.......,I have nothing agianst John Bush but he killed these songs... you really get bored listening to these classics when JOhn is singing it...thank god Joey Belladona is back so i can finally like over 13 years i can listen to the classics with Joey back in the band.Old School Anthrax fans should avoid this piece os crap...
1,Destroying some classic songs...,"Im not quite sure what the intent of this album was, but it was definately a mistake. Since the production back in the 80s wasnt that great, I can see maybe wanting to rerecord some of the classic songs. But they should not have done it without Joey. New singer John Bush totally ruins what are some of the greatest songs ever. I dont have anything against Bush really, he was great in Armored Saint. But Joey is just so much better. Old school Anthrax fans should avoid this piece of crap cd."
4,+4? More like +2,"This CD is actually a 2 CD set. These are the actual track listings:Disc 1:1. Deathrider2. Metal Thrashing Mad3. Caught In A Mosh4. A.I.R.5. Among the Living6. Keep It In The Family7. Indians8. Madhouse9. Panic10. I Am The Law11. Belly Of The Beast12. N.F.L.13. Be All End All14. Gung-HoDisc 2:1. Anthrax2. Lone Justice3. In My WorldI can't figure out why this is labeled ""+4 Bonus Tracks."" It's more like +2 since the only additional tracks that you get that aren't on the US release are Anthrax and In My World (since Lone Justice is a hidden track on the US release). It's still a great album, but you should at least know what you're getting before you pay the extra money.As far as the CD goes, I don't have anything profound to say about it that will help you decide to buy it or not. All I can say is, if you're an Anthrax fan, get it. If not, my condolences."
3,Was this necessary?,"I am a bigger fan of the post Joey Belladona Anthrax. But after We Come For You All, their strongest outing in years, and a fairly good live album, they do a rehash album. Usually this is an act of desperation, and Anthrax has shown they have been rejuvenated after W.C.F.Y.A.However, I was just too curious to hear how many of these songs sound with John Bush. Most of it is excellent, with Madhousue being my personal favorite. Most of the recordings stay fairly true to the originals, just slight tweaks to hit Bush's vocal range. If you are a big Anthrax fan, and a bigger fan of the John Bush era, this is the only way I can reccomend this album (especially if you don't own any of the Belladona era albums)."
2,Wrong Title and Picture,"The product I received was a Gameboy Advance link cable with gamecube compatibility. Two stars for good quality, but wrong product."
4,it works,it works but its a really cheap mass produced cable that comes in just like a manilla envelope. it fits tight in the gameboy. (one little warning when removing the cable kinda wiggle it out and pull from the base because the connecter tends to pull apart a little bit but it will push back together.) but all in all good thick quality cable.
1,Not as advertised,Advertised to be a Gameboy Color link cable made by Nintendo. This is some generic third party cable made by some unknown manufacturer.
1,not that great,"microwaving to heat, picks up way too much moisture making it sopping wet and rice like. hot spots are scalding doesn't heat evenly."
5,"But, what was the author trying to say to his audience?","The introduction was way too long, more like several chapters of details about the pre-nazification days to the era of a one man rule under Adolf Schicklegruber. The author seemed to speak more about his wandring and rebellion to established auority and rejection of socity's values. He really says little about the social democrats and the communists other than they fought one another, but they, the communists also fought pitched battles with the Freikorps, the Reichswehr and the Sturmabtielung and often won a temporary victory, but Mr.Guerin mentioned that? Maybe he did not see ""The Big Picture"" and reported a limited view from where he stood? He sounds like a flake who makes no committment to any idology and sponges off the dedicated who share their food and shelter and maybe more? I'd still buy the book as I want to learn about the unfortunate era and look at it from all angles and hear all sides of the era of the holocaust!"
2,This Book was NEVER PUBLISHED and DOES NOT Exist,"I had two different librarians search for this book and after extensive checking they found it in just one private library located in New Hampshire. When I checked with them, they said it was just a computer entry and that they did not have the book either.In addition, I asked the librarians to check out the ""Raiko"" company, supposed publisher of this book and they could find nothing about it.Our best guess is that this book was never published, or might have been published in limited edition in Europe. It's availability is ZERO.I gave it a poor rating only to warn people in this review that the book probably does not exist and not to waste time in a fruitless search for it.If anyone has actually seen this book and can give details on where it was published that would be great.Van Nghi has many fine books published and this in no way reflects on him or his books."
3,Ehhh...,"Did not live up to the first book. It definately had its little twists and turns, but nothing like The Shunning. At the end of the first book Beverly Lewis brings Daniel back. I was looking more for him in this book, but was hardly in it. I understand why, but I think introducing him could have waited until the end of The Confession. I wanted to know more on how Katie's Amish family was doing, or how her friend from home was doing. Feel like there was way too many characters in this book. Not sure if I am going to read the last book or not."
5,The Confession,"I don't think this book can be reviewed by itself as it is the 2nd in a series of 3. They should be read in order. The Shunning (#1) and The Reckoning (#3). All 3 books are well written by the author Beverly Lewis. I think one would have to have an interest in history and learning about other people's way of life to thouroghly enjoy the books. But, they are not boring books. Even though, my Grandparents and those before them were Mennonite, I know very little about that or the Amish beliefs. These books have made me want to research and learn more.I enjoyed reading them, easily got involved with the characters, and will recommend them as good reading to my family and friends. I plan to keep my copies as part of my personal library."
4,Heart-warming,I truly enjoyed this book and the first book in the Heritage of Lancaster County series. Lewis makes the community come alive for the reader. I felt as if I were a member of the community attending church meetings and baking bread. I can't wait to read The Reckoning.
3,Slow-moving sequel with a sad ending,"While it's great that Katie/Katherine was finally reuinited with her mother in the end, why did there have to be quite so many obstacles? I will continue to read all 3 books in the series, because an important part of the story is lost without reading the whole set, but I'd like to see a little less conflict!"
4,Katie's back,This is a good follow-up. The plot doesn't disappoint. My mom and I read this together and couldn't put it down. The series is so good that we gave/loaned it to soem people who have never read this genre.
4,"great book , but....","I know that there is another book after this, but I just wasnt happy with the ending of this book. The story is good and I have enjoyed all other books Ive read by this author. I ordered THE RECKONING so Im hoping when I finish it, i will like the series of these 3 books. The first one was good alone, but I think the second one needed a better finish."
5,A Must-have guide for any questioning teen,"I picked up this book at my local library,reading it in the corner, terrified, lest anyone see that I wasinterested in reading about gays. When I did relax enough to read it, I devoured it. I found a part of myself in all of the teenagers in the book.I felt their struggles. I'm living their lives. I cried when I finished the book. I yearn to be comfortable enough to discuss my sexuality the way these teens did. Reading about their fight out of the closet was a cpomfort to me, a bisexual teenager who is not yet all the way out. I recommend this book to students, teachers, and anyone who has to face issues dealing with homosexuality in their everyday lives. I am getting upthe courage to buy a copy so I can have it to keep."
5,"Don't waste your money, get the Region 2 release!","Another World Entertainment just released this in June and it's exactly the same as the BCI release.Same extras and everything, only a lot cheaper!"
2,"Great dryer, poor durability","Conair may have stopped making this particular model. Either way, I have to say that I really like this hair dryer! The reversible diffuser has been one of the best I've ever used, and my super-fine hair gets dried without becoming burned or frizzy.Now the bad news...I've owned 3 of these over the last few years. I know that a hair dryer typically has a rather short life, so perhaps my expectations are too high, but I've had the same problems with the dryer each time I bought one:*The detachable filter is very flimsy and breaks very quickly.*The diffuser - although great - also tends to break at the point where it connects to the dryer, and then the diffuser will continuously flop around while the dryer is in use.Hopefully Conair can come up with a model that is similar without these flaws."
2,DATED ....,Old software that is not compatible with either Windows 7 or Vista. It will not load under any circumstances.Its a shame there is no update for this software because the information on the disk was pretty decent and accurate.
3,Pretty good.,"This album is a set of pretty good hip hop tracks with Miri's beautiful strings in the background. This is more of a compilation than a Miri Ben-Ari CD and there are only about 7 minutes on the CD where she plays alone. Highlights include ""Keep You Head Up High"" with Lil' Mo and ""Sunshine to the Rain"" with Scarface and Anthony Hamilton. But there are a few wack songs like ""4 Flat Tires"", ""Jump & Spread Out"" Remix and ""Star Spangled Banner."" Thank goodness this album doesn't contain ""Sick Wit Da Flip"" on it. That song is awful.I would reccomend this album for someone who wants a decent hip hop compilation, not a Mir Ben-Ari album."
3,So-So,It was very heavy on the hip-hop but didn't really showcase Miri's talent. It was also quite annoying to have her name announced on every track.
5,Great Sound!!!,"Not my usual type of music but was very impressed and recommend this to any person wishing to listen to something new, different and of quality"
2,Why is Miri playing second string?,"I was looking forward to hearing Miri play hip-hop, but what I mostly heard was a lot of other hip-hop artists, with Miri somewhere in the background. I want my money back, or an album where Miri is actually the featured player. I did like what I heard her play, but I had to strain to hear it, and she wasn't really taking the lead on anything. If she's going to be playing with such a loud gang, maybe she should at least get an electric violin so we can hear her; and if she's not going to take the lead, maybe she should be billed, at best, as a collaborator, so people aren't mislead into buying something they aren't getting."
3,Not Bad At All,"Miri Ben-Ari is defintely talented. If you are a true music lover, you will appreciate this album. Although she has different artist featured on the tracks, you defintely hear her presence in each and every track. I like all the tracks except ""4 Flat Tires"" and ""Star Spangled Banner"". My favorites are ""Miss Melody"", ""Sunshine To the Rain"", and ""Fly Away""."
3,"Coming into the country, late 20th century","Even though this book gives the reader the sense of autobiography and biography, it's always interesting for the reader to imagine what is and isn't real. Someone reading the back cover and learning that the author no longer lives in New York, would be interested to read an account of his moving from NY. The book is accessible for most native born Americans; there are some lovely images. For example, ""...melting pot of the world, teeming with immigrants. And their melting generated indifference; the way open flames and lamb generate grease."" It's wonderful to be shown our country from another perspective. This book does that so well it's almost anthropologic in its perspective. The characterizations throughout are clear and intriguing."
4,A wonderful saga,I have thought that I would never experience new emotions after learning by myself the first steps of a new life in America. Tudor Alexander reveals new vivid colors in a wonderful saga as old as America since Columbus.
4,Starring Stumbler,"Daffy Duck has been declared as the king of the ducks, throughout his animated career, but this collection still struts that showcase in the history of Warner Brothers.The Stars Of Space Jam collection, reflects six animated cartoons with the mallard of showmanship. The cartoons range simply from three directors, Robert McKimson, Friz Freleng, and Art Davis. Four of the cartoons are from McKimson, including Daffy's only cartoon with Foghorn Leghorn, The High And The Flighty, and zany toons with Porky Pig, Fool Coverage and Boston Quackie.While many other Daffy Duck collections still live up to par, this collection still comes in second place, right behind Daffy Duck: The Nuttiness Continues from Warner Brothers Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection. Egotistical or not, this quackmeister still stands a chance for stardom."
4,Fabulous cookware,"Le Creuset makes fabulous cookware, unfortunately very heavy but I guess that is the price you pay for such terrific culinary results."
3,"Fun music, depressing engineering","Four stars for the music here! If the music on this CD doesn't bring a smile to your face and make you want to dance then check your pulse! :) The music here is live performances by this ensemble in various places and times. The music is varied but uniformly good and sometimes superb. If you like the style even a little then you'll love the music here.Two stars for the sound quality. On the other hand, the recording quality is also varied and ranges from awful to mediocre. The microphones are distant and there's (for me anyway) excessive pickup of the audience on many tracks. When the audience masks the the music there's a problem in my book.Bottom line -- you'll enjoy the music but I hope you don't find the recording quality too much of a distraction."
5,A Nostalgic Memoir,"This is the memoir of a woman whose grandparents left the (celibate) Harmony Society to marry. The book is an older publication. I enjoyed the photos and the details the author remembers--for example, of feast day menus. The tone is noncritical, but it does add to my understanding of the Harmony Society."
1,It leaks.,"This sprayer is nice-looking, and I didn't have the thread problem reported by another customer. However, the bottom seam leaks. Back it goes!"
1,Mine Wont Play,"Mine came shrink-wrapped and brand new in the box, but none of the discs will play. Im furious. Anyone else have this problem?"
4,Depends on what you want...,"This is definately NOT a club album, but more of a prepping to go out mix. I really like this album because to me it is a compromise. I like harder house and trance, but my wife hates it, but likes dance grooves with vocals, or vocal trance if you will. So this album is kind of a compromise in our house. There are enough 'noted artists' that are mixed to make her happy, and enough 'rarer' mixes to make me happy. So again, it just depends. Sample it and see what you think.As far as comparing it to the Ultra titles, I'd have to lean on this album being slightly better than most of them.I like End of the Earth, Technologic, as well as the Van Dahl, Basement Jaxx, and Dirty Vegas tracks, but sadly, my favorite is Dido's Sand in my Shoes...I love this remix!"
3,EHHH it's okay.,"I sort of have mixed feelings for this title. Some scenes were really cooland all, but I just could not get into it. Not to mention some episodes were really repeatative. Not really sure of the story either."
3,Disappointing,"Am I the only one who has read this book and didn't have questions about the ending? Our heroine Taylor is attacked by a Black Rose terrorist, with Savage, a female T-FLAC operative, appearing to be part of the attack. Later, in what appears to be her deathbed, Taylor tries to mumble Savage's name, but is too weak. Taylor, of course rallies and wins the day, but Savage's role is not brought up again. I felt sure the author was going to write in Savage as the head of the Black Rose group in the end, which seemed to be where the story was headed. Instead, Taylor conveniently forgot to mention it again once the hero came into the hospital room and proposed. Unless Ms. Adair plans to continue the story in a future T-FLAC story, I thought the end to be disappointing without that final resolution."
2,Too many loose ends,"I have been a big fan of this author's work and was eagerly awaiting the release of this novel. While the premise was good, the story had so many holes and dropped plotlines that it was ridiculous. References that were made to add depth to the characters were never followed through... What happened in Hunt's past that made him wary of relationships? Who was the head of the infamous lady terrorism group? Also, where was the Wright family from the previous novels in the series?I would wait for this to come out in paperback and read her earlier works."
2,I liked Kiss & Tell better...,"this book was just not as intersting. I skimmed the last 100 pages. As another reviewer mentioned, Hunt was very much an alpha male - hard to believe the lawyer would fall for a jewel thief."
2,Hot Ice Melted!,"First time read for me of Cherry Adair. Storyline was interesting but I felt like I was watching a video game without getting dizzy.Taylor was a cute little heroine, very gutsy and that is what attracted Hunt who was a typical alpha male. Now that I have the gist of Ms Adair's books I think I will try other venues. But it was a quick read by the pool! We are having beautiful weather here in Florida!"
5,Terrific romantic suspense!,"Taylor Kinkaid is a jewel thief and Hunt St. John is a T-FLAC agent hot on her trail because she stole disks from a terrorist that contain information that could lead to a terrible disaster.I thought this was a fantastic story, nonstop action and a wonderful romance. I kept picturing this as an action movie......starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, maybe? :-)"
4,Hot Ice,"I thought this was a very good book, however not as good as the previous book, On thin ice. But on a whole the story was well thought out and the characters believable."
1,Piece of junk!,"Lasted about 4 weeks. Full of holes after that. Only used it about 4 times. Junk! Don't waste your money, get a real hose."
1,Only good for a few uses,"Waste of money. Hoped it would be good quality given the high price tag compared to standard garden hoses. I bought one of these at a local hardware store about a year ago. It's about the same amount of trouble to setup as a normal hose. You must uncoil and remove completely from reel to use. Worked well enough the first few uses. But when I brought it out to use the next summer it leaked so badly that no water even made it to the end of the hose. I always handled the hose carefully, it just doesn't hold up."
2,It's not a fire hose.,"It's not a fire hose or even a decent hose, for that matter. I got this to use when we visit marinas on our boat. Connecting and dragging around 50' hoses to the marina hose bibs is a real pain. The hoses take up a lot of room in the lazzarette and always seem to catch on something when you take them out. I thought this compact hose with a reel would answer my concerns. Wrong! Although the hose looks like a fire hose it doesn't have the strength or durability of one. It must be completely removed from the reel and the hose must be straight before applying any water pressure. It can't have any kinks or bends. After using just a few times, it started to develop leaks and cracks. It just isn't up to robust use. The reel is more durable than the hose. I dumped the reel and now use the hose as an extension behind some bushes in the yard where the leaking doesn't matter. My search for a great hose for the boat will continue."
2,Um ok,"well since my name is ALICE and I have lived in SMIHTERS i decided to read the book, but it totally was not me and should NOT be classified as a kid book. I guess some people could like it but i did not relate with her and nobody in Smithers is like that! AND I AM REALLY 15!"
1,Stupid book,"I'm a thirteen-year-old homeschooler. I thought this book was terrible. Plain and simple, the word is terrible. Homeschoolers are not religious fanatics, demented freaks, or children who need therepy. I'm perfectly sane, and so is my brother, and all my homeschooled friends. Juby should have done a little more reserch before writing this book.I've read many, many books, but this was by far the worst. I found this extremly insulting. There is no word to discribe it. I'm horrified that such a book would even get published."
1,No Good!,I honestly didnt like this book. It dragged and took a really long time to get to the main plot!
3,Just OK,"I found myself with mixed feeling about Alice upon the completion of her story. While I did find the book humorous, and even laugh-out-loud funny at times I felt unsatisfied at the end. I was waiting for the opinionated, outspoken Alice of her diary to push through to the real world and she never did. In addition I felt the happenings with Goose boy at the end where haphazard and not enjoyable leaving me with a sour feeling about the book. Basically I thought the book would pull itself together for a strong ending that would quell my doubts but instead left me even more disappointed then I thought I would be."
2,"Alice, immature","I first bought this book because it was from a Canadian author, and it's the type of book I like, ones that have teen problems. This one has too many, and is completely unrealistic. I mean come on, who can honestly say that their mom has picked a fight with a girl who is after you? Most of the events in the book are so immature they aren't even funny, just sad. Very, very sad. I fully admire Susan Juby's guts to write a book like this, but up to a certain point you just want to kill Alice. Most of the sub-plots wouldn't even happen to socially challenged kids, never mind normal people. (...)"
1,it just drags on and on....,"I love reading, and I usually make a point to finish any book that I start, but when I began reading this book I got so bored with the extremely weird story of Alice I had to force myself to skim the rest of it. There's no main point to the story and the author seems to be trying too hard to create conflict in the book. The characters are all extremely boring and overall its just a very poorly written book."
3,There are better books out there...,"""Alice, I Think"" is an interesting book when it comes to sociological issues like fitting in, and dealing with who you are, but it's a bit heavy to be called hilarious. There were some funny moments, but for the most part it was just average. Three stars because there were times that I went back to it just to see what the outcome of an event would be, but once I had finished it, I was kind of disappointed. Not as funny as promised. There are better books out there."
2,"Alice , I think","I recently read this book , thinking that it would be a great book because I could relate to the charecter , being home-schooled.Let me tell you it was a lot worse then I expected it to be and I found myslef wishing to reach the end soon. Not becuase it was thrilling but because the book was so slow and , I hate to admit , boring!It was quite bizzare , I kept wondering if Alice ,the main charecter, had some sort of disorder.She is pulled out of first grade after being teased and totured by fellow classmaes and is homeschooled at home untill her counselor suggests high school.Throught out her journal Alice has life goals , which wa sinteresting to follow. But other then that this book was a little odd and home-schoolers ( aka home based learners --- according to the book) were potrayted as individuals who dont know how to behave in society."
4,Overly dramatized but good,"I am a homeschooled teenager who will be going back to school next year so I am in somewhat the same situation as Alice though my family is not as disfunctional...I thought the book really showed a witty but VERY overly dramatized version of ""the adventures of unsocialized teen trying to find her 'style'"" and it was sort of a ""what NOT to do"" manual for anyone who's not in the 'cool' crowd. ""Alice, I think"" really made me laugh and was a refreshing light read. I think anyone who thinks they've got it bad socially should read this and will come out thinking ""well, life's not so bad, at least people don't think I'm as weird as Alice..."""
3,Kind of bland,"This book, although mildly humorous in a sarcastic way at times, is pretty bland. Being a slightly negative and sarcastic person myself, I am not against blunt people who ""tell it like it is."" However, Alice is too over the top in her negativity. When i finish a book, I like to get something more out of it than just ""oh, here's a story about a naive and condescending girl who is constantly surrounded by hippy-idiots and everything about her life sucks."" I like books with a slightly deeper meaning. I know that sounds corny, but it's true. Another thing that I didn't like about this book is how unfairly it portrays hippies. Come on, not all feminists who eat organic food and do spiritual stuff like yoga are that stupid and idiotic. Alice is a bit hard on her mother. I mean, her mother actually doesn't seem that bad, just a little wierd at times. Anyway, this is an OK book but it really isn't that great."
5,So funny I was sweating,"The whole time I was reading Susan Juby's Alice, I Think I was transported into a mind and life that was so compelling and funny I never wanted to stop. It was so true to my own experiences as a teenaged girl that I really identified with Alice, her screwy but lovable family, and the bizarre assortment of locals in Smithers, BC. I was so tired of reading all the usual books in the local and school libraries that I took a chance on this one, and I can't wait for more from Ms. Juby. I highly recommend this to readers of all ages as one of the funniest, most charming books you'll ever have the pleasure of experiencing."
1,This books is BIZARRE,"Read my title. That's the only way to describe this book. When I began reading it, I found it truly insulting to homeschoolers. Insulting to their intelligence both academcally and socially. Though it was very unrealistic, one is never happy to read slander about themself.However, I soon realized that all the characters in this book are, indeed, suffering from some kind of mental illness. It's not just the homeschoolers who are socially retarded, it appears that Juby thinks EVERYONE is retarded. Reading this book is a painful experiance not only because of the slander, but simply because of the poor writing.The only thing this book has caused me to do, is waste time and wonder if perhaps Mrs. Juby is suffering from some kind of mental illness herself. I would put this book on the level of a 12 year old's fanfiction.Do yourself a favor and skip this book."
2,There are much better options available...,"Terribly uncomfortable. It will not support 2900 pounds. I weigh 245 and it is already bending. The design is poor and it is just a matter of time before it breaks. For the price, there are much better options available."
3,Not for the handicapped,The spread of the legs is too small and the height is not conducive for elderly or handicapped. I doubt that I will be able to use it.
5,Absolutely NOT Creationist Nonsense,"For those of you who appreciate logic and science that shows the revelation of the mind of the creator instead of it's refutation, as is erroneously believed. Just as an apple seed produces the apple tree, the information needed for something to exist cannot be formulated and implemented through accidental means. Accidents always cause confusion, not order. Yet the volumes of info intel needed to formulate our reality reveals an invisible, thoughtful and ""brilliant beyond our understanding"" mind which has brought things together to work for our benefit. Just this point of the co-existance of all things working for our benefit and not our harm, should tell you something about accidental creation versus purposeful thought. A well written book based on reality and it's revelation."
3,"Dated, but solid starter book for the curious","This is one of the first books I read when I started studying the question of ""evolution vs. creationism"". Dr. Gange covers a range of topics and arguments at an introductory level but provided enough references so I could continue on with research. I would recommend it for those new to the conversation, who want to see the interpretation of data from a creationist // intelligent design perspective.There are, of course, counterpoints for most of his topics, a number of which have developed in the years since this book was released. Although the book may be a bit dated, I have revisited it several times and as of yet have not found his points to be proven false by them, or given me serious concerns about his arguments."
2,Disappointed,"folks..when I read the reviews and heard that Jim Crow was the next big thing to come out of the south, I bought this album..what I got however, were tracks on par with the latest No LImit or Cash Money release. I am an east coast fan to the very end, but I give every region of hiphop a chance and am sorry to say that these guys just aren't on the same ATl level as Outkast or Goodie Mob. I just hope Music WOrld lets me exchange it..nuff said. Peace"
2,Collorful Images,"If you are looking for something with a lot of images, that's what you need.Very nice and fine printed, but it has not so much to say."
3,a beautiful book with an erratic tone,"This is a beautifully designed book with a wonderful selection of currencies. As a visual piece, it's a great book. However, what really surprised me was the tone of the text. The author mixes social commentary, political opinions, stale cliches, attempts at witticisms, straightforward history, and humor--often all within one paragraph. Not only did this inconsistent writing style make it difficult to read with continuity, it seemed incongruous with the subject matter. My personal recommendation--if you want to see a fabulous selection of currencies past and present, this book is worth it for the images alone. If you're looking for a well-written history and impartial evaluation of currency design, look elsewhere."
3,A let down,I've enjoyed the other books in this series thus far even though I don't usually like military/political intrigue. However this one just totally bogged down to a stop within the first several hundred pages. The characters were uninteresting and the military minutae became too much to overcome.
2,Boring,"Short and Sweet: This book was so boring I couldn't finish it. I have enjoyed other books by this author - specifically the ""Saga of Recluse"" series."
3,So-so,"There are a lot of things that Modesitt does well. He writes well-imagined worlds and his magic systems are always unusual and consistent. But there are times when he just drives me crazy. No, I DON'T care what color her clothes were and all too often I'm convinced the PoV character wouldn't have either.And honestly, he couldn't write a good love scene if his life depended on it. Fortunately, that's not why I read fantasy, but it would be better if he skipped them since his are so poorly done.And the fact is this particular book got pretty boring. I like that Modesitt does strong political situations but in this one he went on and on and on about it. Frankly, the main thing good about this novel is that it will set up the situation for the next."
5,Surprisingly good DVD!,"This DVD is surprisingly good. I never imagined I would like a yoga DVD put out by McDonald's, but I do! There are several 15 minute yoga routines that focus on different aspects of fitness, such as stress-relief, flexibility, and strength. I do these workouts when I don't have time for much, but want a little something. The music is relaxing and the virtual yoga instructor is actually kind of neat."
1,runs streaks lines,This is the second one I bought that died halfway through the toner. This is not a good buy at any price.
5,Keisha's Doors,Siblings of children with autism often struggle with understanding what autism is and why they don't have the same sibling relationship that their friends have with their brothers or sisters. Keisha's Doors and Marvie Ellis' Tacos Anyone? both offer a glimpse into the autistic child's world that a sibling can understand. I also like that Ellis used a therapist character in her books to illustrate how a sibling might try and interact with their autistic brother or sister.
1,Originally the book was to be intact ...,"HelloOriginally the book was to be intact ...But the packaging being too tight, and the book was damaged ...All the top right corner of the cover and all pages below were folded and are definitely marked throughout the thickness of the book, including the corresponding upper corner of the back cover ...Big disappointment for me ...Best regardsPascal"
1,Get Georgia Irvins guide to schools instead,"I have both books and the format of this book is hard to read. The book is just a listing of schools and education specialist. Almost all of the info can come from the internet. Although its nice to have all the schools listed in one place, there are no raing s on the schools nor recommendations so its is just a big listing of schools and info on them.Buy Georgia Irvins Guide to schools instead, even though that is not much better, there is 33 pages of GOOD text vs none here and a more readable format on the school listings."
3,This is a reprint.,"The new title is misleading, as is the copyright date. This book was originally published as ""Berserkers"" in 1967 and ""The ultimate enemy"" in 1979. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known I already had a copy under a different title. Now I will say that the book is a good read. It's very intense in parts and can be quite graffic. If you don't already have a copy, I recommend it."
1,Not the Feist you expect,"This is the 1st Feist book I have hated, and have read all up to this one. Perhaps he didn't really write much of it, but the co-author did? Boring, slow, too much political background ramblings, BLAH! Terrible. If this had been my 1st Feist book to read I would never buy another. I have to blame the co-author."
4,Very strong pump.,"I have this pump on my 20 gallon long aquarium for the 2 under gravel filters. It absolutely pumps the air with no problem whatsoever. Very strong. It is noisy though. It does seem more like white noise but if you are looking for a whisper quiet pump then this wouldn't be the one.The cord is long and it was a piece of cake to set up. The one I received is all black. It is not like the picture so if you're expecting what's in the picture, I have to assume you will also get a black one. (I prefer black so I was fine with it)I recommend this pump for strength."
1,Worthless,"This product gives a bad name to Organic. It's unfortunate, because I wanted to stay away from spreading chemicals on my lawn. I applied this product about 3 weeks ago, and there is no difference in my lawn at all. Do not waste your money."
1,"Too short, nice color, bad fabric","This was listed as an extra long tie. This is shorter than all of my standard length ties. The color is very nice. The material is cheap, but... hey so was the price.It you like the color and you are short... you may like this tie."
3,Pretty good song,"Mobb Deep is ok and I don't like Nas very much, but this song was pretty good. Check it out!"
4,"Statements about baseball from fans, executives, writers, players, managers, coaches and even umpires","Baseball is deeply interwoven into the American group persona. There is no time clock and very little dynamic action. Most of the activity takes place between the ears of every person watching it. It is not a game that can be enjoyed when ignorant, to savor it, you must understand it. This book includes some of the best statements about baseball, how it is played, umpired and watched. The quotes come from fans, sportswriters, executives, umpires, coaches, managers and players. In combination, they tell a story about what baseball truly is. A game, a business, a recreation and more than a little bit a religion."
2,I really don't care about a fool who digs a hole ever deeper,"I was blessed with a number of gift certificates this past holiday season. that can be the only explianation for the fact that I have purchased the sequel, Independance Day, which remains in the ""to read"" pile. I could not care less about Frank Bascombe. He seems a lucid and thoughtful man one moment and a deaf dumb and blind boy who cannot play pinball the next. He maeks foolish decisions at every opportunity. There are no particularly likable characters. I haven't cracked the binding on the sequel and expect that I will return it. I'd rather read the sports than read about Frank."
1,"""The Sportswriter"" Shoots And Misses","Has Richard Ford ever read a sports page, much less written for one, to assume he has the qualifications to write about a sportswriter? Obviously not. ""The Sportswriter"" is a misnomer. This book is less about sports than about what seem to be random journal entries from Frank Bascombe, a middle-age grump bemoaning his divorce from the woman he repeatedly calls ""X."" (See how quickly that gets old.) ""The Sportswriter"" isn't about sportswriting at all; it fools the book buyer much the way a good pitcher might fool a batter with a curveball. This book and its self-absorbed first-person narrator are so dull is makes one yearn for a good long news story about an arrogant team owner raising ticket prices."
1,boring,This books does not pick up at all and by page 150 I decided that I didn't want to waste anymore time on a book that mundanely describes mundane activities/scenarios.
1,Twenty times too long,"This novel reads like a fine Raymond Carver short story, but padded up endlessly with repetition and unnecessary detail in order to make it twenty times longer than it ought to be. Thinking that perhaps this could be an indication that Richard Ford is better as a short story writer, I went and checked that out. Which was another mistake."
3,All Right,"I have to be honest. I was expecting something different. This is an older book that doesn't translate well into modern times. Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, but Amazon recommended it to me because of my purchases Fight Club, A Million Different Pieces, etc. It is not in the spirit of that type of writing, but what might have been, if that type of writing was prevalant back then."
2,Just didn't care ...,"This book had plenty of pathos, with a shattered marriage, a dead child, and a career seemingly adrift. But with all that, I kept trying to care about the protaganist, a 30ish sportswriter named Frank Bascombe, and just couldn't. Given that the entire book is written in the first person, from Frank's point of view, that becomes a fatal flaw."
5,Totally fine,"This book was a joy to read - and to begin the journey of Frank Bascombe as Ford travels through his life here and in the other two Frank Bascombe novels I will read next. Ford is an extraordinary author, because as he tell of the lives of his characters, he's also telling our own in a way that makes us understand ourselves better. Who can't use more of that?"
2,Second-rate Updike,"Ford has a good writing style, and this novel is filled with interesting ideas and philosophies. However, the book ultimately pales when compared to Updike and others who have written on similar topics (monogamy, death, commitment). What sank the book for me was the character of Vicki - who was depicted in an outdated (even for 1986) and stereotyped Southern Belle manner. Embarassing. I intend to read ""Independence Day,"" but with reservation."
1,not interesting,"The book was in good condition.The story was not very interesting to me. I did not expect it to be about sports, but if anyone buys it thinking it is about sports, they will be disappointed."
2,Pros and cons,"I won't go over the plot because it's been done.The pros are that the guy definitely knows how to string words together. My biggest con was that after all those pages I didn't feel like I knew what made any of the characters in the book do what they do. In addition, the book is kind of dull. The author also uses it to spout little helpings of his personal philosophy, most of which was not particularly deep. Finally I guess these books about middle aged middle class American males are just not my cup of tea--they are essentially ordinary people leading ordinary lives and not worth writing a book abut."
2,Self indulgent rambling,"I ended up with several of Richard Ford's books after a book swapping event. I tried to read ""A Piece of My Heart"" but couldn't keep interested. Then, since ""Independence Day"" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, I thought I should at least try once more and read ""The Sportswriter"" (thinking I would read ""Independence Day"" afterward.While reading ""The Sportswriter"", I found myself skipping large chunks of prose amounting to lists of disparate things, trying to find the meat of the story: what happens to Frank Bascombe and the people around him. I read to the end and felt I had mostly wasted my time. Unsatisfyiing and overly verbose, I'm going to move on to try other new (to me) writers.Glad I didn't spend any money on this."
2,Boring,"Maybe this new realist type of fiction isn't for me, but I mostly found this award-winning book to be dull and aimless. I wish I had read these Amazon reviews before I bought the book!"
3,Ford seeks poetry in humdrum suburban exitstance but fails,"If I had to hang out with lead character Frank Bascombe more then once a year I think I'd have to wring his daydreaming neck. Richard Ford, however, somehow got me to spend the better part of two weeks with him. I always finish a book once I've started it and this one almost wound up in the trash but he eventually won me over and I saw it through. Frank Bascomb's life is nothing special, he would be the first person to tell you that. But, he manages to describe the struggles of the Average Joe in a way that makes an average joe like me reconsider a lot of the motions I go through every day and the ""givens"" in life that I often take for granted."
4,this is a stunning novel,The sportswriter is an amazing novel. it is a direct reflection of Fords ability to show the humman spirit to its fullest extent. He creates relationships that expand themselfs into ultamate diologe and interaction. I started this book with little idea of what to epect but in concluding the novel i felt great about the images and realness to Fords words. I sugest this bok for any one who has expirenced loss in and way and in one time or another felt alone and lost. The dipressing factor of this book is great but it puts life in perspective. I also sugest this book for anyone from New Jersey.
2,an often painfully over-written novel,"The portrait of Mr. Bascombe, the sportswriter, and the loss of his child might be easier to empathize with if the author refrained from overwrought lines like, ""...feeling abstracted and empty in the lemony vapor of suburban eventide."" Who writes like this? High schoolers abusing a page with poetry, in their bedrooms, at 1:00 am, by scented candlelight... and Richard Ford."
4,"""The Sportswriter"" is about moments.","That so many reviewers see this novel as ""self-indulgent"" is testament to Richard Ford's ability to depict, in painstaking and utterly believable detail, a self-indulgent and flighty man. This is not autobiography; it is, however, a portrait of a particular kind of person, someone you need not necessarily like in order to appreciate the artfulness of the novel. Readers looking for a thrill-ride will be highly disappointed, but readers who can appreciate Ford's ability to capture moments in elegant prose (just as Frank Bascombe is intent on capturing certain moments and feelings in his life with no regard for the larger picture) should find ""The Sportswriter"" satisfying."
1,Anticipation,"As I reached the mid-point of this novel, I found my anticipation just growing and growing until it could hardly be contained. Was I anticipating new situations and resolutions of problems for the protagonist? Not exactly. I was anticipating the end of the book. Please. Let it end!"
2,Excellently Written Book About Nothing at All,"The Sportswriter is neither about sports nor writing. It is about one excruciatingly boring week in the mundane life of a mundane divorced man. There is no real story. There is no beginning, no end, and no real climax. We just follow the life of the guy as he moves through his life for a week.The journey is genuine, and Richard Ford very accurately relates the dialog, feelings and experiences that such a man would have during such a week. The problem is that his life is just really, really boring.The main character, Frank Bascombe, is reflective and introspective during this week and while his thoughts seem genuine, they are neither inciteful or interesting.I enjoyed the writing style and it was done so well it might have been a real life journal. Just a very boring one.I can only recommend this book to voracious readers who don't mind spending hours reading without expecting much entertainment value."
1,I refused to read on,"There is little to recommend this book. An author friend swears by Ford. I was determined to read this then Independence Day. The narrator is smug and self-indulgent. The story is boring. Nobody's likeable. The relationships have no tension and are not believable. What passes for insight is either painfully obvious or appallingly clumsy.Pretentious, pretentious, pretentious. Putting it on my nightstand below some other books did make it easier to reach some good books like The Beach which will be published in the US in the fall."
3,Why is this So Revered?,"I've had several people tell me how much they loved this book so I finally gave it a shot a while back. The writing is certainly good and Ford knows how to make believable characters, but where is the real source of interest in the story? Maybe I'm just not the kind of reader who goes for novels that are entirely character-based. I do like a good story with some surprises to keep me interested and this book just started to bore me about halfway through."
1,seconal revisited...,given to me by a friend with highest recommendation. was unable to get past the first chapter which was aimless drivle...agree with other raters 3 & below!
2,No John Updike,Navel gazing of the highest order. His reputation among academics is secure and richly deserved. Anyone who lives in the real world should look elsewhere.
3,The Sportswriter,"The sportwriter is an interesting novel. At its core is a sadness. There is a belief that life must, at some point, go wrong. That is inevitable. So Frank Bascombe struggles to make sense of, and survive in, such a world."
2,"Nice guy, but a dull character","Frank Bascombe is the kind of guy you'd like to meet. He's not judgemental and seems genuinely interested in the people he encounters. But, such a character, while being a nice guy, doesn't necessarily suffice for 375 pages. In fact, there is nothing particularly remarkable about Frank Bascombe -- and while I like him, I'm not particularly moved by his life or circumstances. Most of the story, to me, appears to be a window into the personal philosophies of the author, without much plot to speak of. And while this book might be a valuable tool for understanding Richard Ford, Frank Bascombe's midlife crisis of mediocrity, following his divorce, did not draw me in."
2,another book,"I cant understand those that give this book four or five stars. It is readable but certainly not one of the best of contemporary American fiction.Maybe its just me...Single, young and hungry for action. Maybe I just dont understand books without conflict and resolution. Maybe I'm too much the simpleton to understand the thrill of reading into three days narrative of the life of a Single Dad's social life.It is well written and has some interesting scenes, so I'm not trashing the book, but you wont find me bringing up Ford's name at any cocktail parties."
1,Was happy to give it away -- a waste of my time,"Perhaps I was mistaken in reading a ""man's book""--a previous reviewer called Ford the 'Ann Tyler for men'. I found the book tedious and the main character incredibly full of himself (should I believe this was a realistic portrayal of ANY male??). Will not bother with sequel!"
2,nothing compelling,"I am only giving this book two stars instead of one because the author does have some talent. However, that said, this book was so dull that I only got a little over half way through it before giving up, though I really tried to give it a chance. The story lagged and was painfully dull and none of the characters except for the children were interesing or likeable. Something about the whole book just felt old, from hokey Viki with ""sausage curls"" going to bed early each night to the use of the word ""colored"". At times the language also felt a bit pretentious. I believe people and places like those found in this book exist, I just don't find them interesting."
3,Sportswriter,"Not sure what all the hype was about. For a main character who claims not to be introspective, he is constantly analyzing himself. A good story, but took way too long to tell."
2,Ford wraps up in ten pages what he couldn't get out in 375,"I really struggled through this book, cursing its monotony and lack of direction, but in the end Ford left me hanging. Drama never came through, no suprises, nothing worthwhile-just a summary to let you know that you just wasted your time. In a sense, Ford wants us to become Frank Bascombe, assessing everything to death in order to get any sort of meaning over this entire overwritten novel!! I was dissappointed after reading ""Wildlife"" and looking forward to ""Independence Day""--but I think I'll pass now.."
2,uninteresting frank bascombe...,"Richard Ford is a wonderful writer of memoirs, of relating historical FACTS. Excellent piece a while back about Ray Carver in NYorker. But put him in the novel-length fiction camp and his gas is prodigious. I don't care for his people, who whine, are propelled by nothing, driven by nothing, passionate about nothing, and try to say too much and act little."
5,Great Resource for 1st Century Judaism,"The theory, loudly proclaimed by E.P. Sanders, never sat well with me. He argued that all Judaisms in the first century shared a common core and that all Israel would have a place in the world to come. Well, this is the rabbinic view from much later. But, as Mark Adam Elliott demonstrates with incredible thoroughness in this book, the evidence from texts that actually existed in the first century shows that universalism in Israel was not common. The Essenes and the communities behind the Pseudepigrapha held to the idea of a remnant, that only certain ones would be saved. Different communities had different criteria for getting into the remnant. Elliott's book is more than a defense of a theory about 1st century Judaism, it is an excellent commentary on selected portion from the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Pseudepigrapha."
1,Bad Buy,"I bought this item based on the reviews which were good. What i found was the opposite. The sound quality was bad with static, people complained that they could not hear me and the answer button stopped working after 1 month. I have not yet had the time to complain to Jabra and do not know if this experience is typical but I am very disappointed.S. Dukes"
2,Improved,"2/2007: Nice configuration, good sound (especially for the $), but mechanically very POOR. Plastic construction feels cheap. After 1 month of careful, normal use, cracks developed in the housing (at the small screws that hold it together) and the adjustable ear hook has split almost in 2 at the interface between the hard plastic and the flexible material. Even at $40, no excuse for this. Buy something sturdy.11/2007 update: retailer replaced the broken one & Jabra provided several spare ear hooks. Been using for 9 months (being only a little more careful), no further problems. Maybe the 1st one was just infant mortality or an early bad lot."
2,uncomfortable,"I am a first-time Bluetooth user. I guess I must have ears a lot larger than the people for which this product was designed. It does not fit me, and therefore it is unusable.So, my recommendation is that you try before you buy."
4,Very good for the price.,"I did my research before I made a purchase and it led to this bluetooth. Im happy to say that I was lead to the right place, this headset work very well and easy to use. Plus the price had a good deal to do with it. Great purchase."
4,Works Like a Charm,"Pretty sleek device. Not always too comfortable on the ear, and doesn't perform well with background noise. Yet, all in all, I would recommend the Jabra Headset."
2,"Ok, but there is better for less money","This was my first bluetooth headset and after using it for a week I was very disappointed. The phone I used it with is a brand new LG Venus.It's major flaws was the lack of volume and the speaker clairity. In a quite room you the volume is ok, but in a car or noisy room the thing is worthless. It's too quite to be of any use. My other gripe was with the sound quality. It's subpar at best. The sound was fuzzy and unclear even with my phone on my desk two feet away. On full volume the sound also became some what distorted.Overall I wouldn't recommend this unit to any one. I did return it and purchased a Plantronics explore 330. This thing at half volume is louder and clearer than the bt125. For $20 330 is hard to beat."
1,Sound Sucks,"I could not hear the person, and they said I was very static sounding. I used this in my office and it was fine, but once I tried it in my car it was horrible. The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears. I would get it if you only needed it for indoors. But I'm positive I had the volume as high as it would go on the phone and the headset, but it's too cheap to work in the car (windows up, radio off and everything)."
2,Great looking headset..........,"The headset looks great....it is small and fits nicely. It's one of the first headsets I've used that doesn't feel like it's going to fall off. The problem with this headset is it's microphone. It picks up everything in the room. I was at a restuarant and the person I was talking to couldn't really hear me too well because of it. Also, the headset has a very cheap construction feel to it. The talk button feels really flimsy."
1,Beware of Jabra products--poor quality control!,"Just two days after purchasing the BT125, it quit transmitting while I was talking...still could hear but no one could hear me. Tried everything. Got it to work after turning my Razor off and the Jabra off. Then powered both up. But after 10 minutes the Jabra quit in the middle of my conversation again.I owned the Jabra 200 for three years before it finally fell apart from use. Too bad Jabra now mean Junk.Don't waste your money on Jabra."
1,Seller Has Horrible Sense Of Advertisement,"I ordered this item with UPS 1day Overnight, It was shipped on July 16th and is scheduled to arrive on July 23rd. I did not pay extra money for 1day delivery for it to take a whole 7 days. If the seller can read this, I demand a full refund including the shipping I paid to get it here and the shipping to return it. This is ridiculous, I am furious with this situation. If this does not get fixed as it should be, I am going to proceed forward in other ways."
4,Jabra and PS3 ++++,"I purchased this headset for my PS3, I have a motorola H500 and constantly had problems connecting and staying connected. Now that I have the Jabra I havent had any problems, it was easy to register on the ps3, works great, if you do get a disconnect just push the button and it re-connects while in game! unlike the junk motorola. It is not as comfortable as the motorola, but it works 100 times better. If you have a ps3 I would reccomend this HS over any others, its cheap and works great.If you purchase Warhawk this headset comes with the game, I found the game on sale for $45..so it was a no brainer"
4,"for ps3, kinda hurts my ears though",i bought this after i saw how many people use it for ps3. its pretty good and works with bluetooth phones but after i play call of duty 4 for more than like 1 hour i have to switch to the ohter ear because it starts to irritate but its great quality wise and charges quick.
3,Flashing Jabra,"The Jabra BT125 is a pretty good headset but the damn thing blinks all the time and drives me crazy. The blinking is distracting to everyone around me and very distracting to me when it is dark (rooms or nights). That blue light bounces off of everything. I look like some kind of a lighthouse. Who ever thought that it has to blink, for whatever reason they had for the blinking blink, they obviously didn't think that I would have pull it off to check it(at least in the light). Other than that it works OK."
3,Pretty good!,I got what i paid for. it works pretty good it does pick up a lot of background noise but u can hear clearly and talk clearly. So it works for me...
4,great headset,"great headset, sounds very clear although it pickups up a lot of noise on your end, still i would highly recommend it."
3,A good Basic Bluetooth headset,"This is a good, but fairly basic headset that can do what it needs to without any frills. It allows you to make and take calls and, if your phone is capable and programmed for it, you can use it for voice dialing with good clarity. There are more stylish and comfortable headsets available on the market, but not for a bargain like the Jabra BT125."
4,Good Bluetooth headset for the price,"Purchased the BT125 a few ago. Paired with my Nokia phone flawlessly and started working right after I charged it. However the fit is not as comfortable as I would like. Call quality is good as long as phone is within 10 feet or so. Beyond that, it start crackling (sometimes even when it is in my pants pocket). Also not very good if you are in noisy conditions (driving with windows rolled down, etc).But overall for the price (around 30$ with shipping), not a bad headset."
4,"Great so far, but wish I could pair with more than one device.","Just bought this headset at Best Buy and it works good. It fits quite comfortably and sound quality seems fine. Setup was easy with my Palm 700p and PowerBook G4 (Skype). However, I wish I could pair this headset with more than one device at a time. In other words, if I pair the headset with my laptop, it breaks the connection with my Palm. So, I have to go through the pairing setup for each device. I recall reading another headset's package (Plantronics or Motorola?) and seeing that it could pair with up to 6 or 8 devices. In hindsight, that would have been a nice feature."
2,Cheap,"Sure the price is right but the quality of the BT125 is right in line with the cost. I purchased this for use with my PS3 and the earpiece snapped after the third use. It's supposed to be bendable to fit around your ear properly but it wore out and snapped right where the bendable part meets the harder plastic that is connected to the earpiece. The headset itself worked great, but if I can't put it on my ear it doesn't really matter. Spend the extra money and get something a little better quality, you'll end up doing so anyhow..."
2,Decent Headset,"I picked this up because it was very cheap, less than lunch. Sound quality was good but the volume was low. It doesn't have an ear bud, it has a large round piece that rests just barely in your ear. I purchased 2 and the case cracked on both within 4 months. Jabra was going to replace them, but it wasn't worth the shipping."
4,Headset,I got this earpiece for my wife to use. When we talk it's clear and fits snug to her ear which is a plus so she can do whatever and not have worry about loosing it.
4,"Great Working Headset, But.........",Jabra is a Great Working Headset Loud Crystal Clear but.....The Charger is Cheap and Died Out on Me 1st Day Of Use.And you can't find the charger for this bluetooth at no local cell phone accessories store no where.Warning Blue tooth is Great But.....Beware Of ChargerThis is the Only Catch
4,Good Product,"Good headset. It's not as easy to get on your ear as those with the swivel out ear piece, but it works just fine."
2,Almost usable.,"The shape of the hard plastic ear hook was designed to cause pain - note the 2 hard plastic jagged corners turned towards your ear while the rounded portion faces up and away from any skin that it could interfere with harming.My second complaint would be that you must hold it against your ear to be able to hear anything thus defeating the point of a ""hands free"" headset.The price is good and if you wear it in silent places where you stand a chance of hearing through it then it's almost usable but I've gotten Motorola 500 headsets for about the same price on Amazon and they work much better and are comfortable as opposed to painful."
