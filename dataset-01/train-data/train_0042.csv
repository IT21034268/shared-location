3,a most interstended book.,This book as a lot of bloodthirsty wolves. The young boy went camping with his father. They met up with a pack of wolves when they went deer hunting. I like this book because it talks about wolves and has some gross stuff in it. Farley Mowat has a lot of detail about this book and the writing really lets you understand it better.
5,"For nature lovers or otherwise, a must-read!","Saw the movie a long time ago; never got to read the book until now, and I am glad I did. Beautifully written and an eye-opener for those who do not realize the pressing problems inherent with resource exploitation and development in the last remaining (precious) wilderness we have. It will always be good to know that there are still places out there where nature rules!"
1,They call him Hardly Knows-It,"I didn't actually enjoy this book while I was reading it; although there were some parts that were interesting, a lot seemed very unbelievable.I was felt betrayed later, when I learned that Farley Mowat had written a HIGHLY fictionalized account of his experience, had spent very little time with the actual wolves and besides hadn't been there alone at all! I absolutely can't stand fiction being sold as ""an absolutely true account"" -- this crossed a line. And now that it has been revealed as fictionalized, it is truly astounding that it is still fooling people and is still being classes as nonfiction."
1,Never Cry Wolf : Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves,"To put it very simply, how can a fictional work be considered ""Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves""? Very deceptive and misleading in it's title. A fictional book about wolves; yes, a true story; no. Read to enjoy a fictional world drawn up by Mowat, but if looking for a true life story stick to non-fiction writings as this is certainly not among those."
4,The discription in the book is very vivid.,"""Never Cry Wolf"" is a true story about Farly Mowat's studies of wild wolves in Alaska. The book details his studies and observations of one particular pack of wolves. In his studies, he conducts an experiment to see if a large animal (human) can survive strictly on field mice, and he is the guinea pig. He does this because he notices that this is all the wolf family is eating in the spring, and he wanted to see if it was really possible.This book is an excellent selection for any reader interested in wolves or an Alaskan adventure. Also any reader interested in a lot of feeling and emotion would be completely satisfied."
4,Especially for Animal Lovers,This book is a good introduction to Mowat. It is one of his early books and will be appreciated by all animal lovers. It enhanced my knowledge of and respect for wolves. The movie is also excellent and I highly recommend it. Charles Martin Smith plays the part of Mowat and is perfect in the part.
5,I Don't Read!!!!,"I had to read this book in school. I hate to read never had. Most books you read in school aren't that good but this book is different. If you like Dogs, Wolfs or any kind of animals you will love this book! Get it."
5,Great Seller!,"This book was for my daughter, who is an environmental activist/eco warrior. She LOVES the book - it arrived on time, was new and we had no problems with this order. Thank you."
1,I don't think they would print what I would like to say,"I read this ...how do you say ""NOVEL"" pretending to be non-fiction when in grade school years ago.Since then I have learned that Sir Mowatt doesn't let the truth get in the way of a good yarn.I will never read any book by him again. ...I give it a negative 5 stars.save your money and buy a comic book."
1,"Ahhhhh, I didn't like it.","This is a book about wolves. It is a far cry from Dr. Seuss, but is still good for children. I as and adult, did not like the meaning behind it and it was treacherously boring, but if you want to read go ahead, because you probably have lots of time on your hands."
3,"If you have better things to do, go do them first","this book is very boring. Only read this book if you have nothing better to do. It has some funny and entertaining moments, but is not very interesting."
1,A bad experience,I have a bad experience with the bought of this product because after a month I don't received the merchandise. In the future I will not buy any product to this company osipmail.
1,"Way too slow, way too boring.","As a true lover of reading, I rarely run into a book I truly detest. However, I found Never Cry Wolf truly awful. I found it very difficult to actually finish it. I thought it would be a good outdoors book, but boy was I wrong.The problems begin in the first chapter. It seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the book, or anything, for that matter. After that, it was simply too slow and too boring. Nothing ever really happens. I was still waiting for the excitement to begin when I reached the last page. No excitement ever came.I would really like to warn anyone off who is thinking of reading this book for pleasure. I guess if you are a professional environmentalist or are obsessed with wolves or something, you might find it interesting, but I sure didn't."
5,A great first effort by America's greatest popular author.,"Roe was a chaplain and war correspondent during the Civil War. After the Chicago fire, he was moved to write this stirring account of that tragedy. The conflict between the two main characters is more mezmerizing than the fire! This is an outstanding book by my favorite author."
3,Ian's Review,Rampage:World Tour is pretty boring. when i first got the game it was fun but then I got tired of it. it got boring because you do the same thing on each level which is destroy all the buildings and eat people for bonus points. If you are thinking of buying this game then rent it before you buy it.
3,eeehhhh.......,"Rampage World Tour is excellent at first. At first. Once you get into the game it's hard to stay awake. All you do is smash things and eat people. Thats all. When you have a friend, its more fun because you can have death matches, or look at the chart to see who destroys more buildings. If you have no friends though, then I can only reccomend that you rent Rampage World Tour."
3,Okay game,"Rampage: World Tour is a great game for people that delight in destruction, but for anyone else, it could get very boring in a short period of time, all you do in the entire game is destroy buildings, and mutilate people. This can get annoying after a while, so I would only suggest this game if you planned on playing it with a friend; this will add a little extra intrest to the game because you and your buddy can duke it out in the death matches, a pretty fun game... but don't expect to get obsessed with it."
4,whatever,Dont buy this game it is fun for the first2 days and after thatit gets so boring i mean you dont even acomplish any thing forabout 300 levels. you should save your money for jamesbond orsomething.
4,They made a classic even better,"In the game u choose to play as one of 3 different monsters, a giant lizard, wolfman, and a king kong like charachter. The object is simple, destroy and eat as much as possible. In each level you have a number of buildings to destroy while being shot at by army troops. The graphics and animation in this game are trully eye pleasing, nothing like the old arcade's 16 color scheme. And if you get bored of destroying buildings, take it out on one of your partners, punch them, kick them in the groin, or a jump kick to the jaw. Its just plain fun!"
2,Playing this game is equivalent to taking a nap,"I played this game while I was babysitting at a friends house. I played for about half an hour. By then I'd had enough. You'll like this game if you want to destroy stuff and eat people over aand over and over again. All you do is start the game, choose your monster, and start destroying. You do the same thing every time. You walk around and punch a building holes form on it and you grad the stuff and eat it. Or, you can punch airplanes or cars. In conclusion, i found this game boring. This game would be good in an arcade for 25 cents for about 15 minutes. done."
1,Could there be a worse movie?,"I am a college student majoring in film with an emphasis or writing and directing. We had to watch this film in one of my film classes. One word: junk. This movie had nothing redeeming about it; I do not care what people say. The lighting was bad; cinematography was shoddy at best, and the acting atrocious. Maybe I am a cynic and am slightly biased towards modernist films. I usually find foreign films to be some of my favorites including Run, Lola Run and The Color trilogy: Red, White, and Blue, but this movie did nothing for me except annoy me and infect me. I am sure none of you agree with me, but I felt I should inform people that this movie is defiantly not as great as everyone says it is and should not be placed on a petal stool. This is just my humble opinion."
4,It all depends...,"I recently viewed this film from the public library, as the print broke repeatedly when it was shown at the local ""art film"" house (or, well, the closest thing we have in these here parts.) The art direction is stunning, and the visuals are extraordinary, especially the parallels drawn between the shifting sand dunes and the body of the woman with which the hero is entrapped. It was more involving on a story level, or perhaps rather at a character level, on second viewing. Nevertheless, I do feel compelled to point out that liking or disliking this film is NOT an intelligence test. The main character is quite unsympathetic to an American audience, and one is not condemned to repeated viewing of ""Rush Hour 2"" if one thinks so."
5,Woman in the Dunes is Brilliant and often forgotten,"Brilliant Japanese film that captures the futility of ""modern"" life and extols the virtue of love and understanding. May be disturbing to some people. Has astounding visual impact, juxtaposing drifting sand and flesh."
5,Allegorical,This is one of the most haunting tales I have ever viewed. Bits of it will probably never leave my mind. A true masterpiece! A great deal of genuine humanity relieved at times by humour and irony.Available from amazon. com
2,Woman in the Dunes DVD Transfer,"""Woman in the Dunes"" is a minor classic of Japanese cinema; beautiful to watch, intriguing, and with a superb score and sound track by Toru Takemitsu. The DVD transfer,however, is very disappointing. The manufacturer claims that the DVD version is a restoration made from the original negative. This may be true, but its a mediocre restoration, soft and much too dark. Night and many interior scenes are barely legible. This is the first premium priced DVD I've seen that is inferior to the VHS version, at least the cassette put out by the Connoisseur Video Collection."
2,what a mess,"I ordered this book for a class. When I received the book, it had so many highlighed marking in it, I could hardly read the first few chapters. I know some used books have a few marking but; this one was bad. I will continue to order use books, but; I will be more careful, whom I order the book from and look more closely at the reviews. - back to school- So. Carolina"
3,"Lovely Knobs, Disappointed in Amazon.",I ordered 2 of these knobs to try them out in the kitchen before purchasing all 20 that I needed. The knobs are great! I'm so excited to have them in my kitchen. I came back to purchase the rest of the knobs and the price had jumped from $2.86 to $4.49 in one week! I'm really disappointed in Amazon. I always look to them for the most competitive pricing online. I ended up finding them somewhere else for $2.79. I learned my lesson. I will not always go to Amazon first and assume they have the best prices.
2,Defective?,"Within 6 months of installation, over half of the lights illuminating the buttons went out leaving me to search for the buttons at night time. Why go for the buttons when I have a remote, you ask? This is because apparently the remote cannot hold up to frequent use. The most frequently used buttons (which are like little bubbles) cracked and the covering came off. It's almost impossible to use the buttons without the covering over the remote board because it doesn't recognize when just your fingers are pushing on the bare board. Also, after going on the official Pyle website, the ""Contact Us"" link is apparently the only link that didn't, and still doesn't (4 months later) work so I emailed them through one of their other links (regarding some other question, but inquired about my issues) yet still have not received a response."
1,720 lousy,"Well as you have read from other reviews, this game is not that great. But what they forgot to mention is that the graphics are terrible! If you can remember 15 years ago back to the days of atari, that is EXACTLY what the graphics are like! the game is so repetetive, and after 1 day you get sick of it! Even if you are a skater do not buy this game, i love to skate and this was such a dissapointment. i suggest if you want a skating game real bad, then wait for the next one and save your money!"
1,720,"This game is terrible. The graphics are horrible, The music is terrible, and the controls are the worst controls in the world."
3,Is 720 good or bad?,This game is an all around fun game. The handiling on this game is not the best. I love skatebording and this game was nothing like it. You have to go around to all the parks and gain points by pulling off tricks. Its very hard to do tricks.
3,it is an old classic,"It is hard but the tricks you can do are fun, I had this game for the Nintendo Nes system the music was cute. this would not be only skateboard game you should buy. this was a game I played a while back and has stuck with me."
3,"Outrtanding singer, recycled songs","Read my review of Recuerdos 2 as it applies here also. Nana is simply the best singer the world has ever known and this CD does have many magnificent songs. Unfortunately, all of them are recycled from previous CDs such as Libertad, Tierra Viva, Nuestras Canciones 1 & 2, and The Classical Nana, all of which I already have on CD. Cucurucucu Paloma appeared on the Passport CD, which I also have. If Philips thinks it can just take a few songs from here and there, put them on a CD and expect me to buy it then it must think I'm stupid. This is just a marketing ploy. In any case, the source discs which I mentioned are very highly recommended. I would only purchase this CD as a present to introduce someone who enjoys Spanish songs to Nana's music."
2,nana mouskouri recuerdo,this is a horrible cd. sound is so tinny and glaring. recording is very subpar and inconsistent; volume fades in and out. not definitely recommendable.
2,Wrong Cue!,"The company sent me the wrong cue. The tip and deflection of the cue is not great, but expected for a jump/break cue that cost less than $150.00. I would not recommend this cue for anyone that's looking to use this cue as a competitive cue, but will work fine for practice or recreational use. It's not designed for league play."
4,Soul Food,"This was a great book. It told a lot about a Jewish woman's feminist journey -- well, from an Orthodox perspective. I thought the writing style was rather unscholarly, though, even though the ideas were extremely valid. Perhaps this was meant as more of a ""light read"" even though I used it as a reference for a paper."
2,An OK book on an out-of-date technology,"WML is based on XML, and is a content format for devices that implement the WAP Wireless Application Protocol specification, such as mobile phones, and preceded the use of other markup languages now used with WAP, such as XHTML and even standard HTML. WMLScript is the dialect of JavaScript used for WML pages and is part of the WAP.This little book was quite helpful when WML and WMLScript first entered the scene at the turn of the century. It introduced a new technology in a very simple and accessible way as only O'Reilly and Associates can. However, as processing power in handsets increases, it is likely WML will be phased out in the future. Thus at this point it isn't even worthwhile to learn it. I give this book two stars out of respect to how useful it was when it was first published."
2,A Start !,"This book is a very immature guide. The editing is quite poor too. However if all you want is a fast introduction, this book just might help; please don't mind the headache at the end of the day."
1,Perverted,"There are hardly any songs on here that aren't dealing with sex. I bought this when it came out because it was on sale at my local record store, and was disgusted when I listened to it. I like rap a lot, in fact I have several rap/hip-hop CDs, but this is just porn music. These guys need to grow up and realize that women are people too, not just sex toys. We Want Some P***y? Bill So Horny? Rap can actually be an art form, not just a medium for 20 somethings to get horny over. If you want some intelligent rap with actual MEANING behind the lyrics, get something by De La Soul, Jurassic 5 or Outkast. Seriously, if anybody worships this music, forget about having a girlfriend who isn't a prostitute."
3,More a l950s screenplay than a novel,"Sea of Grass has larger than life characters, one dimensional, more suitable to the big screen than a novel. The love story is melodramatic and doesn't really involve the reader. It may have played better in the nineteen forties than it does at the end of the 20th century. They function more as a backdrop to the drama being played out on the land than as a story unto itself. The real story is a battle of the homesteaders against the great cattle herders with Mother Nature winning in the end. A moderate recommendation."
3,needs a good mowing,"The Sea of Grass is a tour-de-force of artistic prose. Conrad Richter's word painting of New Mexico at the end of the cowboy era is chock full of delightful metaphors and imagery.The problem is that all that poetic language crowds out the dialog and characterization. So the story of macho Colonel Brewton and his mail-order bride falls as flat as a limp tortilla. The affection and forgiveness that Brewton lavishes on his whorish and supercilious wife is understandable only as a stereotypically proud male devotion. Her idolization by the rest of the town (including the young narrator) is not justified at all.Read this novella strictly as an interesting period piece, ignoring the plot, and your time will not be wasted."
3,"United States Reader-Short, but Hard Read","This book gets to descriptive and gets hard to understand at some times, you must keep in tuned otherwise you will be lost forever!!!"
2,ahhh -1 thumb down,"I am a huge Jamie Oliver fan and was fascinated by his work with the UK school lunches. So I grabbed this DVD when I saw it.This is SHORT - just 20 minutes for $15!!! thought it was longer.The content is OK, but the description here made it sound like much more. ""turned his attention to American schools""... uh - in this DVD he does a 10 minute interview with the news guy... that's ALL... and about 2/3 of the interview is not even with Jamie.Would have been OK for like $5 or even $8 - but NOT for the price of a full length movie and with no real NEW content for anyone already familiar with Jamie's UK School lunch reform."
4,Fluke,Fluke makes a great product. if you want quality repeatable measurements Fluke is it. Although I wish the case was bigger
2,A bit high pitched,"I teach yoga and meditation and use music for class. I really like Shamanic Dream 1 and 2, but this is bit high pitched and hissy. I think that it's meant to sound celestial, but I find it actually a bit agitating."
3,Not as good as Shamanic Dream I,I was disapointed in this CD. Anugama's Shamanic Dream I is my favorite yoga CD. This did not live up to that CD and was only so-so. The beats were not as hypnotic as Shamanic Dream I.
4,An Exilerating Novel,"This book is fast paced, vulgar, funny, and human. The world of Duddy Kravitz--an extraordinary Jewish teenager in Montreal in the 1940's--may sound very far removed from our lives, but very few things I have read have struck me as being so irresistably recognisable as life. It would be to deny yourself an immense pleasure not to read this book. Certain chapters are as classic as things we remember from great 19th century literature."
5,The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,"Sometimes quite hilarious. Good story that takes place in the Jewish sector of Montreal. You have to love Duddy, the kind-heartd rebel."
3,Richler hadn't yet reached his peak,"For an example of what this author can really do, read ""Barney's Version.""It seems that Richler specializes in making dislikeable characters (see Terry MacIver in ""Barney's Version""), but he hadn't reached his peak as of this writing.The character development is not all that good, nor is the general direction of the plot. In short, it's just one more among many kitsch bildungsroman. Save your time."
1,Stating my opinion,The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz by Mordecai Richler is one of the worst books I've ever read. I feel the language in the book is unreal and some of the situations in the book are just plan undescribable and obscene. In my opinion I feel this book should be banned from being read in highschools. There are some students that I know who stated for a fact that they've never seen a piece of garbage as worse as this book and I fully agree with them. The use of language is uncontrolable and plan disgusting. There are people who don't use the kind of language that's use in this book and when they see it they immediately skip over the word because they don't feel right reading such language and they've grown up not using or thinking of using it. To conclude I would like to say taht The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is nothing but trash and filth for students eager and learning minds.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A somewhat slow-moving drama which may alienate the more action-oriented viewer by focusing more on atmosphere and mood than events, Chocolat is ultimately a rewarding and intelligent look at the end of the colonial era."
2,snooze,"It was a pretty movie visually, but there is no plot and the character relationships go nowhere. It may be interesting to watch once, but only if you are very awake! It's a snoozer for sure..."
2,Slow movie,"We bought this movie for our daughter's French class. We were disappointed that there weren't English subtitles for all of the dialogue - some of the words that were not the main character speaking were not translated. Also, the plot was very slow."
2,Not very good...,"This book is beautifully illustrated with a frequent subject being lilith's naked form which is a theme of the book really. Sleeping with Adam, Eve, Caine, Lucifer, God (yes, God), Animals, and probably a dozen or so more folk that I've forgotten. The Book is best for a Sabbat book because it's appeal to such base sexual things instead of any divine mystery or questioning doesn't provide much. The narrator is also far less interesting than Aristole DeLaurent and Beckett."
5,Best book in the WoD theme,"I loved this book! The words--the visualizations they produce--it's pure poetry, something not usually seen in a source book for a roleplaying world. I could put myself in Lilith's shoes, and understand her pain, her joy. I mined this book for information, and got a teasure. If you deal with Lilith in your game, this is the perfect book for you."
3,Flawed but still worthwhile,"I don't think this would convert someone to liking Alan Stivell's music, but for those who already like his more accessible work it is worth a listen, if you can get hold of a copy -- although don't expect a collection of celtic folk tunes! It was one of the first CDs I bought (which may show how old it and I are!) and I still listen to it with enjoyment. In summary, I think it works well in some parts and doesn't work in others, but unlike another reviewer I don't go so far as to skip over the bits I don't like. Yes, some of the singing is indecipherable; yes, some of the repetition goes on for too long; some of the musical passages don't seem to lead anywhere, but amongst all of that there are some brilliantly written and very powerful passages."
5,Lots of good information on debugging,"This book is one of those books that might be good enough only because the subject it deals with is rare. I have not worked very much with Visual Basic to say how useful it is. From my experience with Access VBA I thought it dealt nicely with debugging tools and error handlers. I wanted to get a better feeling of debugging before going into other VBA books that reports indicate to be full of bugs. The book is nice in that it briefly touches on subjects like ADO. It seems like it will make a good reference. I really can't complain much since I paid one buck for the book. The only negative criticism that I can say to the authors is that the word open in Spanish is not abir, but abrir."
2,Not pleased at all!,"The singing is not really exciting. The arrangements are poor and played on electronics. Overall, a disappointment.The seller was excellent, good price and speedy delivery.Fausto, NJ"
4,Very good solo debut from the former Soundgarden frontman,"On Euphoria Morning, Chris Cornell shows us the vocal sylings he's hinted at, but never had the chance to fully explore as the lead singer for the now-defunct Soundgarden. His debut solo effort is a great one - filled with lilting melodies, unique chord arrangements, and a few radio-worthy tunes to make this a commercial as well as a critical success. Standouts include 'Can't Change Me', 'Preaching the End of the World', and 'Pillow of Your Bones'. The album gets a bit weak towards the middle (as most seem to), but comes to a strong finish with 'Pillow' having you sing along and the eerie 'Steel Rain', which you can envision Chris singing somewhere in a dark, desolate place. If the album were a bit more consistent throughout, and his earlier hit, 'Sunshower' were included, I'd give it 5 stars. But again, it is a solid effort as it stands, and I'm looking forward to seeing him in Philly at the Tower Theater!--Sean"
2,A Lite Alternative,"Songs like ""Follow My Way"", ""Can't Change Me"" and ""Flutter Girl"" are admittedly catchy. Cornell's voice is strong throughout. But, ultimately, this is coming-out music for someone who just bought their first grunge clothes at JC Penney."
4,Songwriter for the age.,"We have known since the Singles soundtrack that Cornell was more than just Soundgarden - he was a songwriter and performer who had a successful stint with a great band. His expertise in the craft goes without saying (doesn't it?) What makes him mine (and yours) is his unbridled humanity. He's of the breed of artists who grows before your eyes, bravely exhibiting artfully his personal angst, commenting on society, exposing beauty and ugliness and wherever he sees it, inside and out."
4,Great comeback in a different style,"Chris Cornell of Soundgarden? I must have chosen the wrong CD, I thought when I first listened to this album. I really like it, much more than his work with Soundgarden, because now he writes his lyrics from a more personal side, he expresses deeper feelings as love, loneliness or grief. The first single, ""Can't change me"", is a great mid-ballad which sounds, I think, a bit country-like, but that's great! The album is a great combination of his talents: Writing, playing, singing... And he's singing better than ever before."
4,I wanted a LITTLE more Soundgarden,"I'm a more recent Soundgarden fan, but also a fan of Zeppelin, good vocals, good songwriting, and interesting guitar work. This album does not rock in a Soundgarden sense, and is more laid back.Still, the songwriting, guitar and especially Chris' talented pipes really make this an excellent album apart from his former band. He really is one of the best singers in rock, ever, and that fact really stands out solidly here."
4,"New Direction, Same Feel","Like Sting, who steered The Police to the New Wave and pop success they achieved over their tenure, Chris Cornell's vocals and songwriting drove Soundgarden to soaring success. Whereas Sting has evolved into a soft-rock jazz-and-pop guru, Chris Cornell has retained his dark-cloud-in-silver lining flavor but toned it down to accomodate his later years. This is a rock album but one that could slip through into alternative or classic-rock formats. It's smoother and easier on the ears than most Soundgarden records, but it still pushes and pulls and struggles within itself. Overall, the bottom line is that this record shows from where Soundgarden got its power, and even if this record doesn't knock you down with grunge and sheer volume, it will stay with you long after you've shut off the cd player."
3,3 goodies,"love his voice...3 great songs - especially ""pillow of your bones""...maybe the rest of the cd will grow on me?"
2,It lacks the feel of his previous work.,Chris Cornell and Soundgarden used to make great rock music. What has happened to him now. Has he become mellow and been diluted by a love interest. Most of the songs reflect this. I was a massive fan of Soundgarden and bought the CD because of this. I cant say enough how dissapointed I am at this poor attempt at an album. Soundgarden R.I.P
1,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Soundgarden since the release of Louder then Love, and I absolutely loved Cornell's work in Temple of the Dog, but this CD doesn't compare to his previous work.This CD lacks the passion and intensity of all of his earlier work. There is not a single song on this CD that even resmbles something other then a ballad. And while the CD is slow and melodic, it lacks any real hook or feel that I have come to expect from Cornell.Unfortunately, this CD is just flat out boring."
1,salt in the wound,This CD has no remnant of what Soundgarden was. Any fan that's mourning the breakup should listen to the old albums and spare themselves this souless pop.
1,"I'd rather listen to ""Euphoria"" by Def Leppard...","I used to be a Soundgarden fan, but I have to say that this is a very dissapointing album. Boring,and without great lyrics or music. Do yourself a favor: ignore it!"
2,Nothing Spectacular,"Well. I came in with an unbiased view. The only Soundgarden song I've ever heard has been ""Black Hole Sun"" and though I liked it, I never bothered to pick up a SG cd. When I heard the first single ""She's Going to Change the World""(I think that's right..) off Euphoria Morning, I was entranced. However, when I bought the cd and listened to it, I realized that this cd was more of a one-hit (actually, 2 and a half) album for me. The other song that I actually had the desire to listen to again was ""Mission"", which was one of the very few songs that had a melody that could be memorable. ""Preaching the End of the World"" was decent, but not extraordinary. I found Cornell's lyrics very interesting, but the music that went with them just left me bored. I would much rather have seen Cornell put out a Jewel-like poetry book then this cd."
2,Waste your money on something else more worthwhile,"Yes, I am a big fan of Soundgarden. I was mad that they broke up. I was happy to find out chris cornell was coming out with a solo cd. This cd has only one good song on it, can't change me, but that;s just my opinion. I just got it today, and i wish i spent my money on something better. Oh well, maybe i'll learn to like it. I just want to say, i was horribly disappointed, and i'm happy for all you people who love this new cd, it's just that......i don't."
1,BORING,SORRY FANS OF CHRIS CORNELL. I THOUGHT THAT IF I LISTENED TO THE ALBUM MYSELF. THAT I WOULD ENJOY IT. BUT IT'S BORING I SHOULD HAVE LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWERS ON HERE. CHRIS NEEDS TO GET BACK WITH SOUNDGARDEN THAT'S AN EXCELLENT ALBUM. LATER CHRIS TRY BETTER NEXT TIME.
1,best of his solo efforts and that's not saying much,This is the best Cornell solo effort and thats not saying a lot. Try out his AudioSlave or Soundgarden stuff it's amazing but this is bland and soulless like his Scream album.
1,Downright Awful,"Soundgarden rules. No doubt about it. But if this is the best Chris Cornell can do on his own, he should bring the band back. This album is painfully bad. I was reaching for the advil midway through the third song. This is NOT anything like temple of the dog either. Any moron who loved this album was not a big fan of BadMotorFinger."
1,soundgarden fan,Hes an awesome singser but he needs the guys from audioslave or soundgarden to back him up. Not that he needs it but when they are together they make the best music known!!!
1,How can anyone take this seriously?,"Lyrically, Cornell sounds like a sub-literate 14 year old scribbling deep thoughts in a spiral notebook: hideous. And the music sounds like it was lifted from a bunch of mid 70s Foreigner out-takes: bland, canned guitar rock. So he's got a big-time voice? So what? I can't believe people like this dreck."
4,Euphoria For A Day,"It would be safe to assume that those in Soundgarden withdrawl would be first in line to purchase this album. But for those of you that never got into the mighty 'Garden, do yourselves a favor: acquiaint yourselves with arguably the last, great, rock record of this decade. Fans of Radiohead and the late Jeff Buckley (who Cornell pays tribute to in ""Wave Goodbye"") will find a lot to like in this, at times, Beatlesque album of haunting, beautiful songs that also happen to rock. Special mention goes to ""Preaching The End Of The World"", where Cornell takes the premise of loneliness on the last day of the world and makes it one of the most romantic songs ever written on the subject. No more Soundgarden ? Perhaps. The next best thing ? Definitely."
5,Even the black cat sitting on the bed is great!,"I've just read the review about the album with bonus tracks...I have the standard album already , and i LOVE it so much. And i really would like to hear the other 2 songs though. Tracks number 3-5-9 and 12 are really great... i love the purity and the flexibility of the lyrics.. What I've just written may sound ironic, but if you love lyrics that are NOT straight-forward, and if you already love Cornell, this album will be a great company for you while riding your bike, or driving alone..."
5,An amazing piece of work,"Well, what can I say? I'm sure many people have extolled the virtues of this album better than i can, so I'll be nice and brief. Simply put, this album moves me. Chris' vocals make me actually run the gamut of emotions from elation to amazement, to despair. As an aspiring singer/songwriter, this album is everything I could hope to aspire to."
3,Like Soundgarden without the passion.,"I was fairly disappointed with this one. While Euphoria Morning shows off Chris' amazing voice and song writing skills, the actual songs leave much to be desired. A little too flighty, flaky, and poppy for me. If you're expecting ""Soundgarden Chris Cornell"", you may want to steer clear of this one."
3,"A solid album, but not something that is always enjoyable","Okay, I am a huge Cornell fan, and this album reflects on his incredible music genious. I bought it after hearing ""Can't Change Me"" a couple of times on the radio. That is probably the most rock-like song on this recording. His voice is absolutely tremendous. Still, there are some skipable tracks here. About three fourths of the songs are good. But they are not incredible. I still want Cornell to make me headbang, and none of these songs make me do it. If you can't appreciate any kind of crooning, don't buy it. But if you can enjoy smooth and flowing vocals this is for you."
3,bodes well for future solo efforts,"this album is definitely a showcase for cornell's quite exceptional vocal talents. while much of the material on euphoria morning is pretty thin, it is bolstered significantly by the multi-textured nuances of cornell's voice. there are shades of jeff buckley in places, although unfortunately cornell's as yet undeveloped personal style renders the material more 'sketches for my sweetheart the drunk' than 'grace.' still, well worth a couple of listens. i reckon euphoria morning points to a classic to come."
3,Got annoying after a while,"Although Conell's songwriting is strong, his voice is some sort of Gen-X whine. The best songs ""Can't Change Me"" & ""Preaching the End of the World"" speak in unique rhythms, the rest of the album suffers from Prozac-rock music gone wrong. The album never fully rocks or dwelves into anything special--it just floods languid."
5,Worth looking through 4 stores for!,"First off, if you're opting to go find this yourself instead of buying it off the Internet, good luck. I looked through 4 stores to find this (Try Circuit City or FYE, they've got EVERYTHING), and I also payed $20 for it. It's certainly worth the effort.Out of the many CDs I own, this is one of the very few I fully enjoy. Every track is great, sampling many different styles of music (and pulling them off flawlessly). Personally, I crash to ""Preaching the End of the World"" when I'm depressed, but it's listenable whatever you're feeling. I have no complaints.This is most arguably Chris Cornell's very best, even eclipsing the more recent Audioslave CD (which is pretty good too) and his past work with Soundgarden. It's too bad he didn't put out another truly solo CD."
4,Carefully recorded masterpiece,"This is a ""grunge soul"" album. The songs are slow to mid-tempo soulfully sad songs. They are all excellent - melodic, well-played. Cornell's singing is superb, his vocals on ""When I'm Down"" may be the best. This album is also notable for how well it was recorded. Each instrument is played perfectly (though definitely NOT robotically!!) and the effects (echo, chorus, etc) are also carefully added. The pace of the album rewards the carefull recording"
3,Takes a couple of listenings too....but worth it.,"The song ""Wave Goodbye"" brought me to tears. I could relate to the lyrics do to the recent death of my younger sister, one week before the CD's release. The purchase of the CD was worth this one song alone. Overall, it's not Soundgarden but worth listening to if you enjoy a blues sounding C. Cornell."
4,One of 1999's best,"I don't own a single Soundgarden cd, but I'm going to buy them and TOTD now. His voice is mesmerizing, his lyrics powerful, the instrumentation interesting... every song on this is great."
4,Vocal talent soars,"I'll admit at the outset, I'm 53 and had not listened much, if any, to Soundgarden. As a matter of fact, I didn't realize who Chris Cornell was, or is. And when I saw this in a used cd store, I gave it a spin on their player, and I was just blown away by Chris's vocal power, passion, and range. He really struck a chord in me, that I bought this and have not been sorry. I find it really enjoyable while on the cardio machines with the headphones on, making it easier to get through my 50 min. of aerobic torture.Chris has the vocal clout to just grab your attention from the first song, and carry you on his throat to the very last song played. Oh, and he has a great band that plays lights out!!I would recommend you buy this....NOW!JLMankinc"
5,love love love,"I bought this cd blind. I loved Cornell's voice but not most of the Soundgarden stuff. I ended up playing this continuously. Totally not commercial, nor loud grunge rock - and he has the MOST amazing voice in the world. I have to stop myself from playing this and only this all the time."
5,Wow. amazing material,"=~-This is not soundgarden-~=BUT, this is a very awesome album.Words right now cannot explain how good this album is. Every song on this album is enjoyable no matter what mood you are. At frist i wasn't much of a fan of Chris Cornell, but this album made me a fan"
5,Great,"This album shows a softer side of Cornell,after being in a hard rock grunge band it feels good to hear his lower voice. Steel Rain, Can't Change Me and When I'm Down are the best songs on the album IMO"
5,the best voice on earth- period.,"Okay okay so I'm biased- Soundgarden were the best of the ilk. Matt Cameron is truly great- ben shephard everything a bass player can be, of course kim is a master- but chris was the key.His voice is the strongest part of most of the soundgarden stuff- strong, melodic and with a much larger range than many.This IS a great album- forget about soundgarden and take it at face value- 12 great songs, some of which are destined to be played and played again, by a true legend.Follow My Way, Moonchild, Disappearing One and Sweet Euporia are my highlights, with a few others not far behind. Only the last track is what I'd call 'weak'. This is a chance for Chris's voice to finally shine through and dominate his music- not that there was anything at all wrong with soundgarden!"
3,"ALMOST, BUT NOT WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN","SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE MISSING ON MANY OF CHRIS' SONGS. ABOUT THREE TO FOUR SONGS PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT ON THE ALBUM. DON'T GET ME WRONG, THERE ARE MEMORABLE MOMENTS ON THE ALBUM, BUT I FOUND THAT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO MAKE A GOOD SONG GREAT CHRIS' DIDN'T COME THROUGH. I AM GLAD THAT THE ALBUM DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOUNDGARDEN. BREAKING THAT MOLD AND MAKING HIS OWN MUSIC DEFININTLY HELPS FUTURE ALBUMS. LETS FACE IT, THIS WAS HIS FIRST ALBUM, HE HAS THE MUSICAL TALENT TO IMPROVE ON HIS MISTAKES"
5,one of the best solo albums ever,"That guy doesn't know what he's talking about.Euphoria Morning is a masterpiece. If you are in it for the singles, you shouldn't be buying albums anyway. This is certainly NOT soundgarden or the pop stars audioslave. This is an album born from emotion, not made for hard rock or pop sales. If you consider yourself an audiophile - buy this."
5,"Superb Live album from ""El Negro"" Rada!!!!!!","This album is the latest CD to be relased by Ruben Rada. However, this CD is a copilation of the best songs performed in his tour to Argentina in mid-2004. El negro, along with his musicians will make you enjoy every beat of this CD. This is the first CD live composed by Ruben Rada that has ever been released in the United States via EMI Argentina. You won't regret to purchase this CD if you are a Rada fan!"
3,~BEWARE IS CENSORED~!,Well the book was censored! although it is short its is overall good including story lines and plot and graphics.
5,A note on the definitive D-Day movie,"If you've only seen the movie and have not read the Cornelius Ryan book on which the film is based, here's an interesting tidbit. Yes, a paratrooper really fell into a Normandy well. But while the movie leaves the viewer with the sad impression that the poor guy drowned, he didn't: he climbed out."
5,The Recreation of Normandy,"This movie seems a bit shadowed after seeing Saving Private Ryan, but still makes an impression. This film had 48 international stars, all in leading roles. The story of d-day and the events that led to it are told from 4 sides, the Nazis, the French rebellion, leaders in washington, and of course, the Allied troops invading occupied France. This is one of the closest films to the truth Hollywood has ever made. This was a big-budget movie that shows you where the money went."
3,Yup it was long alright,"I made a mistake and bought the BD version of this movie. I already owned the DVD. (Dumb). Yeah it's black and white alright. The movie is good but somehow seems to just drone along. Nothing really jumps out and gives you anything to be satisfied. Probably watched best with a diet coke, or a light beer, sugarless cookies, or some of those Olestra potato chips"
3,movie ok,"i was not 2 happy with is movie because u only seen paul about 2 or 3 times, and only for about 4 seconds, he should have had a bigger part and be shown more"
3,A too romantic/glorified picture of war,"This movie was good but only because of the history. War is not about shooting the bad guys and running up the beaches yelling ""C'mon, let's go"" War is horrific. If you want a movie concerning what the men of D-Day went through go see Saving Private Ryan"
3,longest day,"writing this again as i forgot 2 put name of movie....well not 2 happy with this movie as u only seen paul about 2-3 x and for about 4 seconds, he should have had a bigger part in the movie"
3,Why not the colorised version?,"I bought the colorised video of The Longest Day and the color improved it.I know that there are people that are against this but the fact is,as far as action movies are concerned,color improves them."
1,Where are the Canadians?,How can anyone consider this to be an accurate interpretation of D-Day with barely a mention of the Canadian involvement. Juno beach was one of the more well defended beaches and the location a key to the success of D-Day. The Canadians fought against the best the Germans had in Normandy and never get the credit they deserved.
1,"Wrong format, I ordered or should have orderd DVD and got VCR",I am in the process of changing all of my movies from VCR Casettes to DVD becausse my player for the cassettes broke and cannot be replaced. I had the VCR version of this already. Don't know who made the mistake
3,The Longest Day,"This movie is entertaining and worth seeing. It has a great many Hollywood ""stars"" doing theroles of real and make believe people and of course it is full of inaccuracies but yet is well donein other ways. The real story of ""D Day"" june 1944 is so extraordinary and incredible that it isimpossible for Hollywood to do it justice but nevertheless most people will enjoy this movie."
3,the longest day,"Reviews the dvd as a two disk item, implying that it is of less compression. The total program is on one dvd with the #2 disk containing un-needed and undesired material, causing the compression to render the movie a lesser quality."
5,Jean has a long moustache.....,"The Longest Day.......one of the greatest WWII movies of all time. In case you're wondering...no, I'm not in the movie but I'm almost certain that everybody else was. This movie is chalk full of every popular actor of the time. It's not a graphic 'blood and guts' movie like Private Ryan but it's very typical of movies of the era. All young americans should watch this movie and realize just how the Greatest Generation saved the world on the beaches of Normandy."
2,The Longest Movie,All the potential to be great but they had to throw in some God awful slapstick. Edit out an hour. Corny .
4,"HISTORICALLY ACCURATE AND EPIC, BUT.....","...it's no ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which I feel is the DEFINITIVE D-Day film and World War II epic! But this film does do justice to the greatest generation, and will forever honor those brave souls that fought and died for the freedoms we cherish. God bless America! Grade: A-"
4,Cameos galore,"This three-hour epic retelling of the D-Day invasion of Europe in WW II is told with a careful eye on details, but not so much on human drama. In fact, the movie is mainly a series of star cameos (the list is impressive: John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton to name just a few), a movie very much representative of the Important Man take on history. The war scenes, for sheer grandeur and scale, are the best in film history prior to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (for WW II movies anyway), but I've often thought the movie might be better watched with the sound off: the words, the dialogue, the actors are required to speak to each other are cliche-ridden and empty. Knowing the story and its outcome ahead of time, it's hard not to be moved, even inspired, by the action, but as it stands it's an action-filled stunner with a mediocre script."
4,The Longest Day,"This War movie ranks with the all time WW2 cinemas like Tora, Tora, Tora. It doesn't have smarmy hand wringing soap opera sub plots that made movies like Midway stink - why would they do that when the battle of Midway needed no added drama? Also, The Longest Day doesn't have the embarrasing self-righteous preaching of social-sermonettes like Oliver Stone movies (Platoon, in this comparative case)."
5,Not Saving Private Ryan - but it wasn't supposed to be,"This is not Saving Private Ryan. And those who compare it to that movie are comparing apples to oranges. This movie tells the story of the Normandy invasion - not the human side of war - and was made 35 years before SPR. It was purposely filmed in b&w to give the movie a documentary style. TLD is truly a classic and accurately portrays the great scale, importance, and desperation of the entire invasion from both sides. If you want to better understand D-Day or SPR then you should see this movie. If you just want to see people get blown away then see an Arnie flik."
1,did not purchase or receive,"did not purchase , did not purchase, did not purchaser, did not purchase, get it!! i have bo experience. i prurchased the other 2 disc ""longest day"""
5,great historical movie of WWII,very excellent movie with historical data ref the turn of WWII in the European Theatre.
4,Great movie with major flaws,"After cleaning up the sound and picture of A Walk In The Sun, we worked next on editing out flaws of a very fine war film, The Longest Day. We edited out John Wayne, The Paratrooper shooting while trying to hit solid ground and the cricket/ bolt sound as you can tell the difference if you don't have a tin ear and last but not least, Red Buttons. I don't see why they can't reedit and remarket The Longest Day again? The German actors where excellent, especially The German actor who tells The German Higher Command that The Whole Allied Army was facing The Beaches of Normandy."
4,Good product for the price,Planning on visiting Normandy and a tour companuy recommended viewing this movie before going. The movie was great and the 2nd disk really tells the history
5,Wonderful Movie,"Wonderful movie!! Given the number of stars in this film, they could never hope to do such an epoch today. And, many of those stars had small roles.It gives not just the overview of D-Day, but the facination of the film is the stories of small groups and individuals during the day and the confusion that took place on both sides of the fence."
1,disappointing,"I purchased the dvd for Father's Day, but it wouldn't even play in his dvd player. The disc was scratched and I couldn't return because my dad informed me after it was too late to get a refund."
2,Froze,The movies great if you get the chance to watch the complete film. As others have stated the film gets stuck halfway through and you cant finish watching it. This cd is the first i've had that has actually failed halfway through and i use the slim 360 to watch movies.
3,Classic WWII Flick,Strong cast -- classic WWII flick of the era. Was not as good as I remembered as a kid seeing it.
5,Lots Of History and Hi Def Too,"Great Blu Ray/ HiDef movie that is a milestone of history for anyone to see and imagine what that time in history was like. Lots of added featurettes too.Over and over, its a great movie."
2,BEWARE OF EXTRA STUFF,"I am a fan of WWII movies. I was looking forward to the arrival of this two disk set. The Film is of course magnificent. I was looking forware to the addition stuff that now comes with DVDs, commentary, interviews, making of films, featurettes, etc. Afterall, there are lots of historians and others who will add to the filmit self. I was wrong. the commentaries are so bad I could hardly make myself finish them. Neither commentaters was prepared. The other matterial was also very poorly done as commpared to what is available on the History Chan and other sources."
2,decent for its time,"The Normandy battle looks like it was shot on some little beach in NJ and the comedy is just pointless. Why try to make a joke out of this subject. The perception of the English, Scottish, and French is just ignorant. Obviously for it's time this movie was decent but to say this movie is realistic is a smack in every veterans face."
2,IT HAS NOT STOOD THE TEST OF TIME,"Director Darryl F. Zanuck tried his best with the technical resources at his dispostition at the time and using the narrative standar for epic movies of that time. But watching this movie today is a really act of courage. It drags and drags, the three hours seem to never end. Also, even if they tried to give a view of the global situation, they failed miserably.The movie is an endless sequence of shell and fire sounds, a really pain. I simply don't like the movie, although I understand what they tried to do."
1,The 2nd viewing after almost 40 years turned into a loser,"Well I will keep this short , because this treatment of the Normandy invasion had me bored for most the the movie. Why? Because the movie is essentially a theaterical depiction of the invasion with virtually no character development ,no story line and no military stragey to show how planning was developed. John Wayne left me realing against his over-blown personality and silly manner.Others were just as bad. I saw this film when it first came out, did not think to highly of it then and certainly know now how poor this thing is. A waste of time and money to say the least. A THUMBS DOWN ! !"
2,I know this movie was made in the sixties but to unrealistic,I saw this movie a couple days ago. It was good but too unrealistic. Soldiers die a short and easy death but this movie cannot be compared to Saving Private Ryan at all
3,Only Color will do,"I refuse to buy this b/w version of the movie, they should also be offering it in the beautiful color version that came out a couple years ago on VHS. I would happily and gladly buy a color widescreen version of this movie, that's the way it should be released. Till then, no dice, I'll transfer my color VHS tape to DVD and enjoy that until they release the official DVD version in color. COLOR OR NOTHING, that's my motto."
2,The Longest video lacks focus.,Despite having 48 International stars and winning two Oscars. I found it to be a big let downThe sory of D-day told by both sides jumped around to much.It seems the plot was all sub plots.Rent it Don't buy it. Not a good war picture
2,OK!,This may not have great explosions but saving pvt. ryan was an awsome tale about a soildier and his trip to hell and back and the longest day was about all of D-day so dont bash saving pvt. ryan ... tnx
5,old man,The Longest Day is without the best movie of its type ever made.It is way better than stuff like Saving Private Ryan which is all hollywood stuff and not really worth watching. I will watch Thw Longesr Day many more times.
5,the greatest war movie of all time,"after seeing films like Full Metal Jacket this looks out of date. But when you listen to it no film comes closer to properly outlining the events of a good battle. With actors like Richard Burton, Paul Anka, Robert Mitchum, and John Wayne this movie was the best of it's day. Today it's got challenges from Saving Private Ryan, Full Meatl Jacket and Apocalypse Now but to me its still the greatest war movie of all time."
4,The Longest Day,"I am buying this dvd for the grandson for Christmas, so it is hard to say is it ok. The transaction was great and price was good."
3,"Great story, great actors, but so-so acting","The chronological method that is used in this movie to tell the story of D-Day is compelling, and worth viewing. But I found fault with many great actors who just didn't give their best performances. Blue ray version works great. No technical problems."
5,one of the best war movies ever made,"darryl f. zanack spent years of his life and his own money to bring this tale of the biggest invasion ever mounted, the operation overlord,d-day. with an all star cast and the best battle scenes ever put on film this is one that is a must for war film buffs and good movie buffs everywhere.while grand in scope it never loses sight of the little personal moments that happen during war. just one of the finest examples of film making you will find,a must for every collection of good movies."
1,The Longest Movie,"I watched on June 6th 2004 ""The Longest Day"" to learn about D-Day June 6th in 1944. In general it was a painfully boring movie. I accomplished my goal of learning about D-Day, but it was at a cost of wasting about three hours of my life. It is my belief that this story could have been told in one and a half hours instead of three."
5,An epic war film.,"I watched this film after doing a tour of the beaches in Normandy and it was amazing. Even though Saving Private Ryan was more realistic, I thought this was a far greater film because it told the D-Day story on a larger scale."
4,"A Truly Great Film , But...","I adore this movie...LOVE it... easily one of the Greatest World War 2 movies ever. Full of great actors and memorable scenes..my favorite being Red Skelton as the unlucky Para caught by his parachute on the church steeple, helplessly watching as all his buddies get picked off...an awesome scene. My only gripe about this movie is the lack of recognition of all the Canadians who played such a significant part in D-Day, especially on Juno Beach. Bizarrely, the Free-French forces get their own sub-plot in the movie...but where the bloody hell were the Candians in this otherwise fantastic film?"
4,The Longest Day,"This has always been one of the movies I would want to have in my collection. It takes a dedicated viewer to watch and follow the entire film, but it's worth it when you get through it. The film attempts to show the issues for both sides of the conflict, the logistical problems, and the inner circle of command decisions that weighed heavily on the outcome of this hugely significant offensive.The producers do a nice job of creating sub-plots and weaving them into the film at large, even if they are not totally factual.It is good entertainment."
5,Great film,Excellent movie.With a great cast.One of the more historiclly accurate war films.A good mix of humor irony and pathos.Highly recommend.
4,Is this version anamorphic (for wide-screen TV's)?,"I own the 2000 version, which is wonderful, but shows up tiny on my new wide-screen TV. Nothing in the description or reviews indicates whether this version has been updated for current TV technology."
4,Faithful,A good faithful rendition of the invasion of Europe in 1944. It presents a good view of the overwhelming organization needed to overcome the Atlantic Wall built by the Germans. The main weakness is the era's obsession with depicting American GI's as wholesome and pure. Well worth having in any WW2 library.
1,"No, no D'Onofrio","Not a great movie. Vincent D'Onofrio is my FAVORITE actor, but his acting skills are wasted on this movie. Cannot recommend this poor movie."
1,I give this turkey two big thumbs down!,"I saw this movie for the first time on Showtime last night, and I think that it stunk! No wonder it never received any publicity when it was released last year!First of all, they should have called this movie ""New Jersey"" because most of the movie was filmed there! Secondly, this movie just validates the fact that Staten Island is filled with gangsters, gangster wannabes, white trash, and morons.Vincent D'Onofrio (who's most famous movie role was Private Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence in Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, ""Full Metal Jacket"") was especially awful in his role as a mentally unbalanced gangster. Ethan Hawke's performance as a septic tank cleaner was ok, but it was a far cry from his performance with Denzel Washington in ""Training Day""."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"The fact that the movie keeps bouncing back and forth over time and the replaying of many scenes did not keep me on the edge of my seat. The plot is okay, I just care for how it was presented."
1,"Tree's died in vain for this ""book""","I purchased this book hoping to get some Linux deployment ideas... The description was perfect, ""Enterprise Linux at Work: How to build 10 Distributed Applications for Your Organization"". However, this book is a disgrace. This book has *nothing* to do with Linux, and nothing to do with distributed applications. All the ideas are java web applications such as an online catalog, web based bug tracking, and an XML database backup utility. Why would you need to do *ANY* of those things, are they distributed, and what do they have to do with Linux? The answer is of course: You don't, they aren't, and they've got nothing to do with Linux. There aren't words strong enough to describe how strongly I recommend against this book. I will *never* buy a book published by wiley again."
5,Rock On Charles Fisher!,This book has been very helpful to me in learning the basics of Linux. It is well written in an easy to understand format. The front cover graphics could be better. But what do I know; I'm just a little troll.
5,A staple for my pond,"I used this on my first pond set up and the fish responded almost instantly. It is also great for partial water changes, just as a precaution. Koi tend to perk up within a few minutes and go on as if nothing had bothered them. (I also use this in conjunction with Amquel)"
4,It's a dictionary of economics,"There's not much to say about this dictionary. It covers a comprehensive collection of economic terms. I'm yet to find a conventional term that isn't included (there are some psuedoeconomic terms that don't appear, but they probably shouldn't be in there anyway).As a dictionary it's definitions are naturally short, but I have always found it useful for quickly jogging my memory or understanding the context of an unknown term.It's simply a great quick reference for economic terms."
1,Sorry,"Sorry, but this was near worthless for me. If you're a Brit, and not interested in the bigger world, it might be better than nothing, but it's worthless as a U.S. reference. I'm not a scholar, but I'm scholar-enough to know bad writing and parochial coverage. (Makes me doubt Oxford in the future.)"
5,Very Helpful!,"supply-side economics! The new age. I believe computers will take over the world but, technological revolution is a thing that will pass."
3,Beginners work out a little hard,"I usually love Wai Lana Yoga videos. This is good, but I think it shouldn't have been labeled for beginners. Since I'm definitely a beginner I was attracted to this title, but I found it more difficult than the ones I've tried and really liked: ""relaxation workout"" and ""goodbye inertia"". Those are great and don't offer the kind of difficult poses found here. Don't get me wrong, it's good and I'm working with it, but I wouldn't make it my first one: I'd make it my second or third, after I had a little more experience. In general Wai Lana videos are very good: focused, practical, with a relaxing and educational attitude and gentle, appealing settings."
4,Good for beginners,"The poses and stretches in this video are great for someone who is just starting out. The instructor does a good job of displaying the poses and she gives alternate poses for people who might have difficulty with some aspect of a certain pose. The music is also very nice. The only gripes I have are really just a matter preference. Her accent is quite noticeable, and although it is not difficult to understand what she is saying, it is distracting to me at times. Also, her outfit changes about every 8 or nine minutes and that is a little distracting too.I would definitely recommend it though, especially since the price is manageable."
4,Love Wai Lana!,"I love her voice. Her cueing is great. The scenery is beautiful as is the music. Her outfits are really beautiful, and she looks so comfortable in them. Finally, no sun salutation! A refreshing change. You wonder of other yoga traditions know any thing else to start a beginner?My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that there is no short version on the dvd. It doesn't even say how long the work out is...seems like way over an hour?? I would have liked a short 30 min workout included for busy days and a separate meditation section. It seems to just go on forever..."
3,I don't do yoga,"But Wai Lana's dvds are so relaxing, I use them for napping. She creates the atmosphere wonderfully (music, scenerey, tone of voice) and you won't feel like you are physically exerting yourself."
5,A Classic.,"I read this book for a course in college. A great little novel that explores the rift between traditional and Christianic Africans, hence the title. The novel is a story about destiny and sacrifice. I'm not sure if it was done on purpose, but story is very similiar to the biblical teachings of Jesus."
5,Powerful Novel,"""The River Between"" tells the story of a young boy, Waiyaki, who is told by his father that he will be the savior of his village. Waiyaki's village is under the threat of integration by the white missionaries who are slowly entruding on their village. Waiyaki is to go to the mission and learn the teachings of the white man and use those teachings to help save his people. Waiyaki accepts his role as savior and feels that education is the only way to save his people.This novel deals with complex issues, including finding a balance between accepted, traditional norms and new world education. The struggle to find a balance is the motivating factor in this novel and drives the story forward. Ngugi crafted this novel masterfully and receives tremendous praise for this work. I highly recommend this book to any who desire to read it."
3,Depressing novel,"Melancholiness pervades this novel in a very peculiar way. Waiyaki alone is a great yet contradictory leader torn between two forces he does not understand. Daughters of the Christian fanatic Joshua, Muthoni and Nyambura, rebel because of their father's stifling brand of Christianity. Kabonyi and Kamau, the father-and-son team who are always playing second fiddle to others, seem bent on polarising the opposing factions, the Gikuyu people and the whites. In the midst of all this, Waiyaki and Nyambura's relationship develops.It is a sad novel because it is the first I have read which ends on such a depressing, inconclusive note. You feel that justice has not been done to Waiyaki, that Nyambura should not have been dragged into it. Yet if you are an African, you would probably see that the scenes will happen like it did. And that is probably why this text is used as a literature text - it is open to diverse interpretations."
5,The Valley of the Shadow of Death: Can one reconcile the old and the new?,"Ngugu wa Thiong'o's two ridges are rivals to the political and spiritual salvation of the Kikuyu. Waiyaki stands between the two worlds. Indeed, he sees that both the traditionalist's view and the tribe and the new Christian view each hold a modicum of merit. Waiyaki attempts to bridge these worlds to strengthen the tribe and connect with the good of the modern world.The man caught between two worlds is a common theme throughout literature and may be seen as trite. Yet, as usual trite themes are only bad when done by bad writers. Ngugu, however, is a fantastic writer. He is to the Kikuyu what Achebe is to the Ibo. This book is thoroughly enthralling; not only do I give this book 5 stars I would put it in must read."
5,Great!,"This is a great book for anyone who is interested in learning more about this topic. Very clear to read, fast shipping."
2,"so, so....",If you wanna hear some real tight beats check out:Rap Beats Hip Hop Beats All Instrumental Music Volume 2
3,Grad Student Communication course reference book,Nice book for first year graduate students . But lacked enough mathematical treatment of the subject . Should provide enough materials for the student to move into higher courses specializing on error correcting codes and digital transmission. Best thing about the book is MATLAB examples where the student can really get the picture of what is being taught . But definitely need for a supplementary book for MATLAB treatments on certain topics is felt.
5,brilliant,"I've been enjoying the author's fiction career for some time. With Always Outnumbered,Always Outgunned, I started to think he was becoming one of the great writers of our century. When he branched out from his original genre to speculative fiction with Blue Light my respect grew.This non-fiction analysis of our current life has little to do with the problems of 'race'. As in his fiction, it has to do with the problems and solutions of humans imbedded in an inhumane system.I belive the 21st century equivalent to Luthers manifesto to the ruling church will be a team effort. Walter Mosley is a member in good standing in that team.I suggest reading Birth of the Chaordic Age by Dee W. Hock in close proximity to this book. Members of the team come from all races and classes.Vivez la revolution! Vivez l'humanite!"
2,A half-handed attempt at sociology,"I like Mosley's work, period. Except this. If you've read any Cornel West or Manning Marable, you've already been on this territory before, and seen it done better. Mosley strolls along, picking through whatever happens to catch his eye in the newspaper, it seems, and levels personal comment on it. Okay, but is it interesting? Not to me...and I CARE about the issues he discusses. I live them. The book just didn't tell me anything I didn't know, and you get the feeling he already knows this when you read it."
5,Just listen....,"This albumn is creative and shows the wonderful guitar style of Son House as well as other bluesmen that Rory has melded into her own unique sound. She brings new thought into the blues community by both being female and telling ""Mama's Blues"" from that perspective. (A song that unfortunately I think a lot of women can relate to-that's what the blues are all about! everyday ) In addition ""Got to Shine"" can lift even the most depressed soul up. Please have a listen to this CD-you won't regret it!"
4,Wonderful acoustic folk/blues,"This is one of Rory's best releases. (Hey, any CD that starts with a train whistle has got to be great!)All of the songs have Rory's trademark passionate singing and acoustic guitar playing. Terraplane Blues, The Spirit Returns, and the title cut are standouts. Got To Shine and Do Your Duty have a gospel flavor. Weepin' Willow Blues is also great.Liner notes written by Rory, talking about her musical influences and some stories behind some of the songs on this CD. (Even explain the train!)If you're looking for more Rory, Confessions of a Blues Singer is another great release."
3,Great Product - Smaller Amount,"I purchased this product thinking I would get the same product I ordered previously. I received about 4 ounces less per bottle at the same price. My own fault, I guess that's what happens if you make assumptions instead of reading the ads. I think I'll look for a more reasonable priced product next time."
4,Great Introduction,I purchased this book while I was waiting for my own Leonberger puppy. It is a nice introduction to the breed and covers all aspects of the personality of this wonderful breed in a straight forward manner. A must for anyone involved in the breed. Especially since there are not too many out there.
4,"Very, Very well Made",This game was very very very very fun to play the best thing about the game is that either sexes can play it. a very good buy.
5,best game i've bought in a long time,this has to be the best game i've bought for gameboy in a while.it has alsome graphics and great gameplay.you can fight many of spiderman's arch enemys like the vulture/shocker/green goblin/the hunter/and many more villans.i definatly gave this game 5 stars.
1,SPIDER MAN GBA REVIEW,"This game isnt good. do not buy this game for your game boy advance. the graphics are terrible and it is nothing like the movie. if u r going to buy this game, buy it for computer(great), game cube(awsome),ps2(awsome),x-box(great).if u dont believe me go ahead and buy it, see for your self"
1,Buy The Gamecube Version,this game is ok but the gamecube version is a lot better. If you're a serious spiderman freak then buy this game for gamecube or xbox.
3,o.k. but too short,"first off graphx:the graphics didn't dazzle me but the bonus levels are 3d.sound: personally,the sound is terable just bleeps and blips.control:the control is pretty good although u use every button,,,including select.this game is way too easy except the bosses but is ok to play 2 or 3 times and its fun taking pictures ang collecting spider coins for secrets."
2,Don;t be fooled by the photo,"Anyone, like me, who has used Lavilin for decades....do not be fooled by the photo (as I was) into thinking this is the old formulation (That seems to be gone for good)or the 1/2 ounce quantity Foot Smart is advertising here. It is the same .44 ounce quantity and the new formulation that several other vendors are selling for less. The new formulation, for me, does not work as well. But still fairly well. I would give the deoderant itself 3.5 or 4 stars ( the old formulation was a 5 for sure), but downgraded the rating here because of what seems to me to be false advertising by this seller."
4,not bad!,I think if my shoes weren't already stinkified I'd probably have better results. I'll get new shoes soon - but I think this stuff actually works pretty good. phew! I was about ready to cut off my feet! ;)
1,Wrong Item,"The long lasting underarm deoderent is great, I ordered this foot version by mistake and had to return it....the packaging looked identical to what I was used to"
3,nah,"I have an old nintendo, not original but newer version. My son 3 year old likes duck hunt and skit shooting so I thought this may give bit more challenge for him. This is a wierd game where you'll need to shoot the main character as he walks/slides to have him fly/jump to do something i'm not sure why. My son wasn't interested at all. it'll be sitting in never to play again pile."
5,a box of jewels,"This has been one of the most enjoyable books I have read over the past few years. I spent an evening reading the ancient tales to my parents, and for the first time in a very long time the evening became dawn without notice of time. I thank you Shems for this. The author's sincerity for the welfare of his audience is pouring out in every page. If you feel as though you are seeking a path to God, or just want to see life from a different angle, this book is for you."
4,when you hear hoofbeats think of a zebra,its a very good book about sufiism one thing i like in it the most that it says that you can not do bad deeds with your hands because the name of allah i.e his 99 names have been printed on your hands look on your hands for few minutes and you will see that there is 81 written in urdu on your left hand and 18 written on your right i want to red this book all again but i can not find it any where i want to purchase it but dont have any credit card facility what should i do if any one can do me this favour please i will be obliged thank you bye
5,Great film,"Transfer ok,sound good. Picture not restored,just transfered to HD. One of few that Rot.Tom.'s gives 100% fresh! Great fun,Great 70's clothes."
1,On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,"This is one of my most favoritie movies.Unfortunately my DVD player was not allowed to play it, something about ""Prohibited by area limits"". I don't know what Non USA Format means.Anyway I have to return it, any try a different copy."
5,has become finer over the years,"Barbra was not all that pleased with this film it has been said. Even so, it has captured her talent at a point in time in her career and preserved that moment and style. The production ""values"" are lush, the concept so outrageous and overly done that it actually works as high entertainment. Even the story has aged well and it's off-beat ambience is modern. The sets on occasion work as if one were watching a play on Broadway, they're that good. The amount of detail reeks of the big bucks that were spent and only now have paid off after 40 years! The visual effects were all done manually, before blue/green screens, and the use of aerial shots in one musical sequence are down-right impressive, as is the performance of Yves Montand and all the extras in it. So what it it sometimes seems like ""Barbra does Oz""?"
2,Egads - Make It Stop,"I'm not a musical person, but I actually liked this movie until about 30 minutes from the end - until they started cramming and jamming all these songs at you. I could get past the horrid 70s fashion and Barbra Streisand not being one of my favorites and the interspersed music throughout - again, that is until 30 minutes from the end. I could get pass the hokey plot, the hokey past-life scenes, the bad love choices, but the end was unnecessary and unnecessarily drawn out. And then, to add insult to injury, they go their separate ways? What kinda unhappy ending to a musical is that? Aren't musicals supposed to be uplifting and inspiring? This musical was DEPRESSING!!!!"
4,"In a Strange Way, This Movie is Extremely Likeable","Based loosely on a Henry James short story THE SENSE OF THE PAST, with a lesser-known Lerner and Loewe score, ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE FOREVER is a strangely haunting entertainment. Streisand has never been better as Daisy Gamble, the psychologically challenged girl transported back in time to a more polite era; Yves Montand is wonderful as the psychologist, and sings the title-song memorably. Add to that the location filming in England's Royal Pavilion, Brighton, plus memorable cameos from Bob Newhart and Roy Kinnear, and you have a really colorful package."
4,"Well, Hello Gorgeous (Transfer)","This DVD transfer of ON A CLEAR DAY is absolutely gorgeous. Even uninterested boyfriends walking through the flat stopped to say ""wow, look at that picture."" And the film itself is actually much more charming and fun than I had remembered. Streisand, especially in the astonishing Cecil Beaton costumed scenes, looks, well, gorgeous too. I don't know much about the history of the shooting of this film, but it feels as if there must be tons of the contemporary day Daisy footage left on the cutting room floor -- e.g, Jack Nicholson just drifts in and out of the film with no purpose at all of being there. Unfortunately, there are no extras at all on this disc. But again, what a transfer. Let's hope Paramount does as good a job with Julie Andrews' DARLING LILI in April 2005 (with extras!)."
5,Definitive Minnelli and Streisand,Saw it when it was first released in 1970! I hope when and if they issue it on DVD that they include all the scenes that were supposedly cut! Imagine! Can't wait for the DVD!! The Melinda scenes are out of this world! So are the performances and the music.
4,directors cut,Get Minnelli's estate to release All that stuff he left on the cutting room floor in a directors cut. The film has always been on my best movie's list. One version I saw had the two stars comming together in future and other version just had her saying they would come together. I would like to see an uncut version.
5,Rise and look around you,"This film was directed by the same great director of ""The Reluctant Debutante"" and ""Gigi"" Vincente Minnelli Born: 28 February 1903, Died: 25 July 1986 (aged 83).As with many films the story suffers a little form the lack of spontaneity of the Broadway version, yet it holds the essence and was not modified too much for the actors or media type. Some great songs arise from this play adapted to film.Daisy Gamble (Barbra Streisand) seems extraordinary in such abilities as raising flowers that are unraisable and hearing telephones before they ring. However she needs to stop smoking and turns to hypnosis to help.Dr. Marc Chabot (Yves Montand) in an attempt to help her discovers a whole new woman and falls in love with this other woman. However the woman is the results of Daisy's regression.This poses a difficulty. Especially if Daisy finds out.Reluctant Debutante Starring: Rex Harrison, Kay Kendall"
3,Barbra's Fabulous....the movie's not,"Get this movie to enjoy Barbra...see Barbra being gloriously Brooklyn-ese...see Barbra dressed to the nines in the flashback sequences...see Barbra do hilarious comedic schtick...hear Barbra sing some really wonderful songs (""Hurry, It's Lovely"" and ""He Isn't You"" as well as the famous title song.) But, if you're looking for a well-crafted musical tale, this movie falls short. What with Minnelli directing you'd think they would've gotten a better script! Maybe it's because of all the cuts Leonare Maltin speaks of...But the story really falls short. And on top of that, Yves Montand grates on my nerves. There is no chemistry between him and Babs. In fact, Yves's best chemistry is with that desk he plants himself behind half the movie! We LOVE Barbra, and forgive this movie. She's very good. The movie is not."
2,Disappointed,"The vendor was prompt in sending the item and it was packaged well, but the tape itself was a disappointment. The color was badly faded and depsite numerous attempts to get the tracking correct, I never could. Therefore, I'm having to view the tape through poor-tracking static."
1,non usa format,"I'm learning fast, i bought a movie ""On a clear day you can see forever from this company in the united kingdom and I can't play it on my dvd usa player.Now I know what non usa format means :("
1,Wow! It's Atrocious.,"My gut feeling is that Ashanti spends more time at the Burberry and Louis Vuitton boutiques than in the studio. Her success is credited to aggressive hype, product positioning, and a talented marketing team. The songs have no regard for originality, depth, or innovation, and they're cleverly packaged for ignorant, ghetto children who gaze at the television watching ""106 & Park."" Her singles, like this one, are played to [much] on the radio, and they blare out of towering, life-size speakers at these trendy hip hop clubs. She accepts awards named after well-established divas, even though she hasn't established herself as an artist and doesn't even possess any real stage presence... People, the madness must stop, and we have the power to control the fate of popular music. Let's shun product like this, and break away from our comfort zones by recognizing the truly talented artists out there. This single ain't doin' it for me at all."
4,Happy!,"I don't know why happy totally flopped since it was like 50 million times better than foolish.Personally, I thought it was a fun,feel-good song with cool beats."
1,another tired song wake me when this is over,okay both songs sample the gap band's outstanding just one version's sounds more up to date while the remix samples ya'll can do better.
1,havent received yet,Have not received yet and ordered a month ago!! movie goods will not reply to my emails on where this is.. wont order there again!
3,SOMETIMES A LITTLE IS A LOT,"While the blending of orange blossom and jasmine is luscious, this fragrance is a bit heavy for me. Perhaps I erred in buying the eau de parfum and should have purchased the eau de toilette. I've read that about three-fourths of eau de parfum is lost after several hours. That's not been my experience with Carolina Herrera. In fact, the aroma is still in the crook of my elbows until I wash it off, and it's as if I had just applied it. For many that may be a major attribute.However, my preference is for a much lighter scent - sort of a ""barely there."" While this fragrance is lovely, I wouldn't recommend wearing it to a concert or any place where you'll be in close quarters with others who may not want to enjoy your wonderful aroma.If your plans are for an evening in some secluded spot with a special someone - enjoy!"
4,PRETTY GOOD..,"ROC TIEN DOES HIS THING IN THIS FLICK. DOESNT REALLY USE A SWORD MUCH IN THIS ONE LIKE IM USE TO BUT SHOWS OFF GOOD HAND AND FOOT WORK PLUS HE IS FLIPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE AS USUAL. HE IS NOT THE REAL STAR BUT THE CO STAR OF THIS FLICK. THERE IS A CHICK WHO IS THE STAR, DONT KNOW HER NAME BUT SHE IS REALLY NICE WITH A SWORD ANS USES A STAFF IN THE BEGINNING. THIS IS YOUR TYPICAL REVENGE PLOT BUT THE KUNG FU IS DAMN GOOD. THE VILLIAN AT THE END USES EAGLE CLAW WITH A LITTLE TWIST TO IT. I WONT RUIN IT IF YOUR GOING TO BUY IT. IF YOUR A ROC TIEN FAN LIKE ME THEN DEFINANTLY BUY IT. THE PERSON I GOT IT FROM DIDNT EVEN GIVE ME A REAL DVD CASE AND THE QUALITY WAS A VHS TRANSFER. SOMEONE NEEDS TO GET ALL OF ROC TIENS MOVIES AND DIGITALLY REMASTER THEM. THAT WOULD BE SOOOO SWEEEEET!!!!"
1,Fake writing for a fake name...,Where does this author get off? First off Sundiatta was the name of a great leader/family/empire in West Africa. A Tellem is Dogon and the other name I have no idea. BUT I am really tired of uneducated people thinking they can use big ideas and ruin them with poorly organized books with spelling errors and the like...boo
1,What a waste of Money!,"I bought this book in hopes of receiving a well written informative book on Reptilian Aliens, but received a little flimsy, poorly written piece of garbage. Please dont waste your money with this ridiculous book, that appears to have been written for an audience of 10 year olds. The author is a black supremacist who obviously can't write well and tries to sound highly intelligent by throwing in a few words about chemistry and atoms into the mix. Please dont bother, this book is a total piece of crap and its gonna be used to pick up my dogs poop..... this book is a joke. It's good for a laugh."
2,Average at Best,After reading all of the great reviews in here i purchased this DVD expecting something really unique and different. Apart from a strong start this movie couldn't overcome its premise of a man awaking to discover the world he lives in is his own (or so it seems). After the initial wow factor has passed this movie plods along with corny acting and some silly plot twists before culminating in an unsatisfying finale. Not a total writeoff but nowhere near as good as On the Beach or some of the other New Zealand films I have seen.
3,Alone Again hear on Earth,"I saw this movie years ago when I was fresh out of college and fell in love with it. It is a very slow moving, thoughtful movie."
4,Quiet Earth and Quiet Film,"I liked the quietness of the film and the simple idea behind the premise of the sci-fi story. It's neat to know that Kiwis seem to have a sense of humor even if they were the last people on Earth and take things somewhat in stride. So this film is a little different and underdramatic but has a neat perspective.What I couldn't get over were the ghastley clothes from the 80s. Strange, I know. Three people are the le last o exist on the Earth and I worry about their attire.A film that's different and low key but well acted."
2,Had potential but,I love the concept of being the last or almost last person on earth. This was just not my type of movie. I do agree it did go down hill on the last half. I guess I expected more but then it may be the difference on how countries make movies.
2,slow and predictable,"I didn't like it at all, It was to slow for my taste and the ending was predictable to say the least :("
2,The Quiet Earth,"Waking up and finding himself alone, with no explanation then, finding out it was his own research companies fault, then finding and falling for the only ...fortunatley YOUNG girl in New Zealand, then finding another bloke, a big young Maori, she changes horses. Being the only 3 alive they sort of stay friends. All very odd, Anyway, the original bloke works out the Apoclypse is going to happen again, But finding out they were alive because they all were in the process of dying, the previous time, they decide to try and kill themselves again, but how, when, where (yawn: why ?) so very drawn out about nothing much."
4,The Quiet earth is worth talking about,"Here is one of the few sci-fi films every made in New Zealand. And it is fantastic, try watching if you like your sci-fi cerabal, sort of like CYPHER or Epsilon. this is not sci-fi action or one for kids. (I think I first liked it at around 15...The acting by Bruno Lawrence is powerful and he carries the film. which has just 3 actors."
2,Dated and Over-Dramatic,"While many people seem to have fond memories of this 1985 film (based on the high ratings), I am baffled as to why.Watching for the first time this year (2008), Quiet Earth comes off as campy, over-dramatic, and just flat out cheesy. The special effects seem like something out of a 60's movie, the actors do things relational-wise that are on a whim, without showing motivation. And the ending is muddled and doesn't explain the last 90 minutes. As the credits role, we are presented with an image that leaves us completely baffled as to what happened. Is the actor in Heaven, or an alternate reality?Who knows? ...but better yet, who cares.Frankly, the best part of the movie was Alison Routledge revealing her perfect backside in scene 10. Other than this, not much to remember.If you like love triangles, 80's hair, long, tusk earrings, and naked balding men, this movie is for you!"
1,pretty much nothing happens...,"watched this movie when i was a kid and fairly enjoyed it. the theme was novel when i was 11. at 33, however, i consider Quiet Earth to have the substance and sustenance of cheeze wiz and crackers.there's no meat to the story, no real character development, and the whole movie feels like a trivial bore. occasionally, stuff will almost happen, but then it doesn't and the audience is left with a deserted planet kind of nihilism.D"
1,Boring - save your money,"The Quiet EarthOf all the fine Sci-fi there has been throughtout the years this has to be one of the worst. The design on the cover and the claims of being spectacular are the only good things about this movie. It would be better unviewed and the cover saved a ""Space Art"" then to actually watch it. Cannot believe they can actually get (or pay) people or companies to endorse movies such as this."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money Like I Did.,"I hated it. I watched it the day I got from Amazon (great service-no fault there) and threw it in the garbage after a lame viewing. My first clue should have been the ""winner of 8 New Zealand Academy Awards"" banner. As with most PC movies this one involves, as it's climax, inter-racial sex between a red head and a native New Zealander. If you're not into that sort of thing, don't buy it. This has little to do with ""end of the world"" type action, and more of ""Panic in year Zero meets Jungle Fever"" type crap. Save your money."
4,blues with a bit of high-class culture,"Okay, the title of this review reflects one reason artists like Charles Brown are undervalued as blues artists. This is West Coast lounge piano blues. The West simply wasn't populated by the poor tenant, hard-scabble rural group that formed the creative core of the blues up and down the Mississippi. So blues moved into cabarets and lounges - lost the raw and rough for a bit of bluesy sophistication. Brown's music makes it apparent why this move succeeded - emotional blues, as accessable to the white middle class as the black gone West for a job. Brown's vocals and piano are supported by sax, guitar, bass and drums ... but it is the piano that shines.Although the improvizational piano styles are different, the smooth texture of Brown reminds me of Cyrus Chestnut. This is a high complement. So try a bit of the Californian West."
5,Vastly improved DS experience,"I picked this up on a whim with a gift card. My DS was previously an on-again-off-again item for me, with emphasis on the off-again. I liked everything about it except having to hold the little pen for long periods. Anybody with carpal tunnel syndrome or the beginnings of it can tell you holding things like pens or chopsticks for long periods quickly becomes difficult and painful. This wrap-around stylus allows you to simply point with your favorite finger. One caveat: to be comfortable on the finger, I keep the stylus a little bit loose. Games where stylus interaction is constant and intense may not do well with it. You'll need to spend some time experimenting to find the best way to wrap it."
4,Excellent police procedural,"This is an excellent police procedural set in Japan in the early 1960s. It brings out the rigidity of traditional society, the smallness of the circles that most people move in, and the claustrophobia felt by the young and the sensitive (which doesn't include the hero, who is neither young nor sensitive). But it's also about the possibilities for remaking yourself that exist in a society still torn apart, just below the surface, by the war. A lot of lucky breaks, and some fairly far-fetched concepts, somewhat weaken the mystery part of the book, but it's well worth reading for the atmosphere alone."
3,"Good read, ends abruptly","This is a worthwhile read, with an unusual protagonist (for crime fiction) Inspector Imanishi is likeable, well-adjusted, and conscientious. He has friends, gets along with his wife and sister, and isn't an alcoholic or an addict. Nor does he fight with his boss. Despite these defects, I thoroughly enjoyed following his efforts to solve an unusual case."
4,One star miss because of too many misprints,"The only thing that I do not want to give this book 5 stars is that there are too many misprints. Maybe this book is not so popular so the publisher do not care to correct their misprint.For the story, I spend the time read this whole story by 2 days on my weekend. When I start reading I can't put it down. The writer create a lot of character and they are all have some connection. Near the end of the story the writer try to reveal the ending bit by bit which are very fun. Even I already know who is the murderer but I still can not put it down because there are many mysteries that wait to be revealed."
3,Inspector Imanashi entertains,"I just read Inspector Imanishi Investigates and quite enjoyed it. It's a procedural whodunnit set in Japan in the fifties. I'm intrigued by the style and dialogue, but I'm most struck by how much I want to go to Japan and see the locations described.There were a number of twists and dead ends throughout the book, but I especially liked the final twist."
1,Too Reliant on Coincidence and Contrivance,"Originally published in 1961, this rather weak mystery shows its age poorly. The inspector of the title is interesting in how dated he now appears; consistently polite and apologetic in his work, and lord of the manor at home. He is embroiled in what seems like a fairly straightforward murder which turns out to be devilishly confusing--but, alas not that interesting for the reader. Matsumoto switches back and forth between the investigation and a group of young, new intellectuals who are darlings of Tokyo's media. Obviously the twain shall meet, but it's not very satisfying when they do. Matsumoto relies altogether too much on coincidences and unlikely convenient relationships to bring things to a solution. Not a book that will make me seek out others by the author."
5,Early Stereo Armstrong on Verve!,"Mastered by Dennis Drake, this collection shows off Louis in the American Classics of Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and Rogers/Hart to name a few. Recorded at Capitol Studio ""B"" (most likely) 1957 and directed by Russ Garcia (who also arranged Porgy & Bess). It's an amazing recording that shows the beautiful string arrangment over Louis and you can clearly hear the charming hollow presence of Capitol's studio as he blows. A CD that's been in print for a long time, but deserves a listen. If you've picked up Louis with Oscar Peterson and the Ella And Louis Cds, let this one be your next dip into dippermouth and his strident late-50's output. Excellent."
4,Even women may enjoy this movie,"Crossfire Trail is a film that even women will enjoy; it's a return to the old days of cowboys with honor and a great shootout at the end. The cast is excellent, with Mark Harmon adding another outstanding job as a villain to his resume. But to me the primary reason to see it is the up-and-coming young actor Christian Kane, who plays J.T. Langston, one of Tom's sidekicks. Girls, watch for the woodchopping scene!!! There is a reason which I won't reveal here why I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5, but I know that a lot of Christian's fans will agree."
3,Ye Ha!,"Love a western. This one's extremely watchable. Mark Harmon is a stunning looking bad guy. Tom Selleck is a wise cowboy. Scenery is stunning. Plot is predictable but then again, it's a western."
4,Good L'Amour adaptation!,"This is one of those westerns where you might have seen the story a dozen times in different westerns. (Man with honorable intentions and man with dishonorable intentions are after the same beautiful woman with valuable land.) One would think that a movie that follows the ""standard"" formula would be rather boring but, I am happy to say, this is not! The main reason for this is the strong cast of Tom Selleck and Mark Harmon.Selleck plays a perfect western hero and I have really started to appreciate him in that role. Harmon plays the perfect sleaze ball and carries his weight in the show. Add Virginia Madsen and Wilford Brimley to the mix, and you have a good recipe for success!Aside from the good acting, though, the sets are colorful and nice, and the story is just fun--like the Louis L'Amour story it was taken from. If you want to divulge yourself in some light ""shoot `em up"" western entertainment, go no further than Crossfire Trail!"
4,Almost as good as Monte Walsh,"It was hard to follow in the beginning but once you caughton it was GREAT!!! I love Selleck, he makes a good kick-asscowboy. I recomend this movie to anyone who loves a goodkick-ass western!!"
5,Western Adventure,Tom Selleck has never made a bad movie (In my opinion) this is no exception.Mark Harrmon (Gibbs on NCIS) plays a bad guy and he plays the part very well.I recommend this to everyone who enjoys happy ending movies.
3,crossfire trail,good tale of fiction. well developed plot. some scenes are very dark and hard to follow other than audio. good western with good guy getting the blond in the end.
4,Tom!,I found this movie to be very entertaining. Tom's great in it and comfortable with the western genre. Watch it!
5,Western Gem,"Great honest western. One of Selleck's best, with a fine supporting cast. The story is fascinating, the script is excellent, the scenery breathtaking. It is very clear who good guys are, and gratifying when they win! Straight up western - get some snacks, turn the lights downm put your feet up, and prepare to be entertained!"
4,classic western storyline with unusual features,"This is a riveting film with good acting and, although there is nothing original in the basic storyine, there are some unusual and interesting features. It is good to see a western which upholds traditional values instead of celebrating meanness and selfishness as so many modern films have done and still do (although it's getting better!).This film reminds me of Kevin Costner's ""Free Range"" - if this DVD film had been on the large screen, with some tighter direction, it might have merited classic status."
5,Reminds you of a Duke Western,"This reminded me of something that John Wayne might have done. Here Tom Selleck does a fine job playing a drifter that makes a promise a dying friend to defend his wife and her land. When he arrives he finds the ranch to be neglected and everyone hasn't seen the owner in a year. Perhaps foolsih but he enlists the aid of two of his friends and a former ranch hand, played by Wilford Brimley, and they make a go of putting the ranch back in shape after a year of neglect. Mark Harmon plays the concerned man that is wooing the widow, but seems to have ulterior motives. This has good acting, sets, scenery, and music. Well worth owning."
5,Selleck Classic,"Tom Selleck is by far the finest western actor around. He was incredible in Quigly Down Under, and is just as great here in Crossfire trail. His cool smooth acting as a trail hardened Cowboy, yet also gentle in Heart and spirit makes you want to jump up and shout hoooray for the good guys. If you are a western fan, as I am, you will enjoy this film.Grab a snack, a cold ice tea and get ready to step back into the late 1800's"
5,Great!,"This little grass shear is great! It is easy to use and I have had no problem with it. It is so easy to change from grass shear to shrub clipper. The shrub clippers are a little short, but still work great. I would recommend this to anyone!"
2,Doesn't last very long,"I have had these shear/trimmers for about 2 years and loved them when I first bought them. But after two seasons of use, the battery does not hold the charge very long and there is little power in the trimmers. For the price, I will not purchase again, since I only got 2 good years of use out of them."
1,6 volt grass clipper/shear,"This unit did not properly hold a charge since new, lasts about 15 minutes. $45 down the drain, American Gardner does not stand behind the battery - 2 years on everthing else! Caution: Don't buy this unit!"
1,poor life cycle - not a smart buy,"We bought this in 4/09 and gave it VERY moderate use. We have little trimming but the product looked like a good buy. Initial use was impressive with good battery life that was always kept recharged. it was never exposed to wet conditions and never used inappropriately.We did buy an extension handle that did not work because the plastic electrical connection was misaligned. We returned that one and asked for another, only to find the same misalignment, so we gave up on the handle idea.We have kept this equipment immaculately clean amd stored in moderate temps.Now (3/10) we have a dead battery that cannot be charged. The service / support has been turfed to a third party that is only interested in selling replacement parts.I'm unwilling to spend any more $$ on what appears to be a great idea gone very wrong.RECOMMENDATON: Don't buy. Look elsewhere."
2,Not as good as the 4.8v model. Finger-chopping hazard,"I owned the 4.8 Volt version of this trimmer, so I figured the 6 Volt, with interchangeable blades, had to be a good deal. Wrong! This unit is grossly underpowered in comparison to the 4.8v model. Perhaps due to the blade/gear configuration necessary to accommodate both attachments. The shrub trimmer attachment is virtually useless as well, due to its size. Plus it's a bit dangerous - the handle was not designed to be used with this type of attachment. Given the proximity of the blade to the guard-less handle, one slip, or mistakenly grabbing the handle with 2 hands (as one normally holds a shrub trimmer), could lead to a serious injury. I would recommend buying the 4.8 volt model over this one. And stick with using full-sized, properly designed shrub trimmers."
1,Lasted 1/2 hour,I used the cordless grass shears 1 time. It cut mounds ofgrass though very slowly. Second time the motor soundedstrong but neither grass or shrub blade worked at all.I am waiting to hear back from the co. on replacement.
1,Worked fine - for 6 months.,"I bought this unit last spring and used it for trimming grass in areas where I didn't want to use the standard cord-trimmer. Had reasonable power and was nice to use, until the NiCd battery died in the fall (after using it once a week). Bought a new manufacturer's battery for it, and that worked once in the fall. Battery is dead again this spring.If you buy it, get an extended warranty that covers the battery. I will try a Worx this time, and see if its Lion battery lasts longer."
4,Great product,"This is a great product. I've had mine for about a year and a half. The only problem that I ran into was that the order was for a three-pack and I ordered three, three packs, but only one three pack arrived and I was charged for all three. It took a few emails and phone calls to Amazon to get a credit."
1,MagiKan blue bags,"I have lots of blue-color MagiKan fillers for sale very cheap. I buy only white bags now. Absolutely. I have a whole box and half of blue-color bags that break easily, mess up the kitchen and gets spouse very irritated. Never had a problem with white bags. Ask for the color they come in before buying. Frank"
4,usage,"Bought the magikan 2 months ago exactly. today the 72ft long bag finished. family of 2. so don't expect 3-4months unless your are single.reduce it to 1 month or less for family of 5 I guess.a bit pricy. hope they had different scents. not a big fan of this smell. specially when I touch the bags my hand picks up the smell.Amazon should bring the 12 pack, that is economically more doable.compared to regular costco garbage bags these come out to .[...] more expensive per monthso do the math see if they are worth it for you.of course they give out free trash can so they can make the money on the accessories."
5,Magican & bags,"We find that the magican is very helpful and economically, a money saver.I can make the bag as long and as short as I want. If I have things that I know will smell, like chicken or fish bones or fish scales, I can cut off with the handy knife feature on the door and tye my knot right now and not worry about filling the bag.The bag feed system is simple and easily installed after all the original bags are used."
1,Lack of originality,"Well, since this is a Jennifer Lopez song, so the riff must be a sample from some famous song. What could it be...ah, yes, The Beatnuts' ""Watch Out Now""! Why does she always do that? ""Ain't It Funny"" remix used music from Craig Mack's ""Flava in Ya Ear"" (and that in itself may be a sample), ""I'm Real"" remix used Rick James's ""Mary Jane"", and ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" remix is from Club Nouveau's ""Why You Treat Me So Bad"" (okay, to all younger fans, Luniz's ""I Got 5 on It""). I personally think that it's to get more ""black"" fans because she's been criticized for being a sellout to white America. Either way, this song is wack. And don't get me started on her singing ability."
5,"Awesome shirt, well worth it.",I got this shirt on sale for $4. It very comfortable and well worth it. Go Cougs.
1,Don't waste your time or $,"I bought it and 45 minutes later I beat everybody. 8 fighters (that look terrible), poor controls, and the ""Rumble Pack"" doesn't add anything to the game. How did this game ever make it into stores? I'm even easily entertained....this game is a joke!"
2,Another waste of money for your Game Boy Color,Don't waste your time on this game. It's not anything like the Playstation incarnation. It will only be enjoyable if you are obsessed with the playstation game and will be happy with this one just because of the name. The graphics are the same as all the other bad commercial GBC games and are nothing like the revolutionary graphics coming on the system soon when nintendo releases their new action game.
1,This Game Absolutely Sucks,"Never buy this game. Horrible graphics, too easy, no difference of boxing style between the ""many"" (8) boxers. Wow, my cousin gave it to me because he didn't like it either, and an hour later I beat it and gave it to him back. I can't even sell it at a used game shop as it has no demand whatsoever"
2,KO for Ready to Rumble Boxing,This game stinks. No question about it. I would rather be a pokemaniac then play it. 8 LOUSY PLAYERS. 3 SECRETS. I SAW THIS UNDER THE EDITOR'S PICK. I HOPED GREATNESS BUT NOW I THINK THE EDITOR IS LOCO EN LA CABEZA. Last thing it BARELY rumbles
2,Tiger Claws III (DVD),"This movie was good, but it was not what I expected. I assumed that Cynthia Rothrock would be one of the main characters throughout the whole movie, instead she had a small part. I was very disappointed because I am a Cynthia Rothrock fan. Otherwise, since I am a martial artist and I like martial art movies I recommend this movie. It contains good fighting scenes as well as a good plot, and an interesting kung fu style."
2,Tiger Claws 3,"For anyone hoping to see Cynthia Rothrock reprise her roles in Tiger Claws One and Two, this movie will be disappointing. Ms. Rothrock makes only a cameo appearance in this film. One gets the definite impression that her appearance was more about box office than about improving the film. The movie itself is not the worst of its genre. Although there is some woefully sad acting in the non-fighting segments. The action is pretty good with Jalal Merhi serving as the protagonist. Cynthia fans would only want this video to complete their collection, not for the pitiful amount of time she appears in this film."
1,Not a CR movie !!!!!!,"Well if you're looking for Cynthia Rothrock action in this movie, there is none. It is not a CR movie, but pure Jalal Merhi!If you like him sure, go ahead and grab this one."
2,DUD!,"Even Carter Wong couldn't save this movie. They give Cynthia Rorthrock second billing and she dies 10 minutes into the movie. She shows up in flashbacks, but not worth it..."
2,"Great, if you want a work-out!","I got this watch, and it was MUCH bigger and heavier than I expected. Not only that, the face of the watch rolls over a lot, and hurt my wrist. I loved the colors, but I had to get rid of the watch. Buy this if you're looking for a huge, funky watch, (and you don't mind hauling a bit of extra weight). If you're looking for a more delicate sort of bracelet, I'd go with something else."
2,Is It Closer? I Still Can't Tell,"I bought the Opteka 2X Telephoto lens for my Olympus C-8080 Camedia Digital Camera so I could zoom in closer to my subject or scene.Unfortunately, I have not noticed much of, if any useful difference in the closeness of the subject or scene.And the lens attachment has one terribly annoying side effect: Whatever you zoom in on, is surrounded by a black circle and yes, it comes out in your photo creating the effect as if you had taken it through a telecope or pericope.Maybe I'm not using it right, but I have followed any instructions given, and it's just not right.Buy if you don't mind a periscope effect or just need a slight edge in aooming in closer, go ahead and buy it, it's cheaper than the T-Con which I'm starting to regret I didn't buy because it said only 1.4X zoom.Hope this helps."
2,Do you need to read this book?,"Do you have a good critical thought process? If not, then perhaps you should not read this book. There are a few decent ideas in it, however, I found a great recommendation from another reader's review: Read Dale Carnegie and Napolean Hill for more useful advice, techniques, and thought processes. Dealing with people is an art, not a science, and needs to be based upon an honest desire to assist others. Carnegie and Hill can help to develop those ideals."
1,Worth equal to toilet paper,"do you want a summary of this book?Stupid kid: ""Hey Mr. Manager, how about you teach me some managing stuff to manage people""Manager:""you want me to teach you some managing stuff to manage people with""?Stupid kid: ""yeah i want you to teach me some managing stuff, to manage people with""Manager: ""allright, ill teach you some managing stuff to manage people with""Stupid kid: ""you mean to tell me you'd teach me some managing stuff to manage people with""?Manager: ""i dont like repeating stuff, ill show you some managing stuff to manage people with""*repeat thought out the whole bookif you are in idiot and you think books like rich dad poor dad are good books, then prepare for a heart warming storyif not, dont waste your time like i did, this bs could have been written in a greeting card"
2,yeah right,"This book is too simple to be really effective. So what if you are a tough or nice manager? This book is basically trying to find a balance, and that's nothing new. And it tell you to evaluate your performance with your goals, thanks for the insight, wow, I've learned so much. Save your money and time. If you must, check it out at the library."
1,Pop psychology crap,"I was required to read this book for a promotional test for my work. This book is chalked full of clunky metaphors, over generalizations, and pedantic bullsh**. It is worthless for anyone who is not retarded."
4,Insightful approach but too vague,"On one hand I really like the way this book gets right to the point without consuming lots of time. Too many books with a similar mission would spend 400 pages, but this one can be read in an hour.The brevity is a double-edged blade though, because the book falls short of fully explaining its concepts. It really touches on only three main approaches to management, but it does not provide anything in the way of examples or contingencies in case real life does not match the story.I am glad I read it but it is hard to say the book is worth the money. You really do not get much content for the price. Upon finishing the book, you'll soon realize the need to buy more books from these authors to flesh out how to implement their suggestions."
3,Looked really old,"This book is a great read for any manager, but the book I got looks at least 10 years old."
4,ONE MINUTE MANAGER,"If you can't take something directly from THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER to make you a better manager, you can take something from it and modify it. Maybe in reality your company can't run efficiently on the ""one-minute"" theory. But you could on a ""five-minute"" or ""ten-minute"" concept. Even that adjustment would cut down on the wasted prodution during those ""costly"" meetings.When I first looked at the book, I thought it too small to be efficient. However, this is a case of ""good things come in small packages"" being real. It's a very interesting, though controversial book."
3,You can be Serious with this book!,"After 20 years of getting my MBA and working in the consultingfield for just that long, I can tell you that this book is way tooartificial and misleading. I wish this book will not paint the wrong picture of management. It over-simplifies human nature and the art of management. If you believe this is the way to run a business, a factory or a classroom, you are dead wrong. For general readers, Cohen's book ""The Art of the Leader"" is probably worth your while."
1,A book that marginalizes the importance of working with other people,"There are a lot of great management books out there. This is not one of them.Managers who follow the guidelines in the book will be far removed from the goings on of the business. They'll be disconnected. They won't form true relationships with the people working for them.This book teaches a crippling minimalist approach to dealing with people. But dealing with people is the most important thing a manager does. It shouldn't be minimized or marginalized.To be fair, the book isn't all bad. It's just mostly bad. The few gems it has are very basic and covered in more much detail by other, better books.If you want something better, look at something along the lines of The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Crucial Conversations, or Good to Great. These are all examples of good management books, IMO."
2,The book that Dilbert warned you about...,"I once worked for a boss who swore by this book, although I think he quoted it more as a justification to constantly issue ""reprimands"" to his subordinates (turnover rates in his office were quite high).The book has a very oversimplified and condescending tone, and attempts inflate the ""veteran manager"" into some sort of sage-like fountain of knowledge (I have yet to meet such a seemingly wise, all-knowing manager like the one in this book).Dilbert owes much of his popularity to fed-up employees working under the thumb of managers who mindlessly latch onto management fads such as this book.If you really want to expand your mind, read *Heart of Darkness* by Joseph Conrad and *The Dilbert Principle* by Scott Adams after reading this book. Reality falls somewhere within these extremes."
5,Easily understandable.,"Quick read, got it's point across by half way through. I am acquiring more books from the same author. Would definitely recommend."
2,Not a big deal!,"Another business book from bestseller list. Does it really help your vision? I do not think so. It is simple, well written, easy to read book. But, I did not get anything from it. If you have really have time, go ahead and read it. By the way, it takes only 45 minutes to finish it."
1,"A Better Title Would be ""Training People Using Dog Training Techniques""","The book's tone is rude and I don't see how the tone could be in the least bit effective. Some of the techniques used are also used in dog training. A real disappointment. With books like this, it further weakens the already faltering leadership we see in corporate America today. Don't bother to read this book or better yet, if you want to train people like you train dogs, just pick up a dog training book."
4,"Great book for anyone of any age group, any occupation...","Book written by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson, it has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide and that just says how successful this book is. It covers the three essential elements of being a high-speed and efficient manager. I also like the ""business story"" format. In today's world, many new supervisors are thrust into a ""baptism by fire"" management environment. I found this book to be an easy to read guide that arms newcomers to management with the basic tools for building worker relationships and getting the best out of their staff. Consequently, their efforts are guided into decisions that generate increasingly positive outcomes in uncomfortable situations. Self-confidence builds and leadership and management styles improve."
2,Only one minute's worth of time...,"I must admit it took me a minute to remember this book, as I have read it several years ago. That gives me an advantage on judging the impact of this book. At the time I had given it 2.5 stars but now it will definitly be 2 stars.This review is hard to write as I don't like critisizing books. People put their heart and soul in it and it may work for a lot of people. However, I'm not one of them. At the time of reading I had no management experience at all, so it should have felt like a quick and easy way to learn something. I found other books a much better help, though.If you want a quick read and spend 4 dollars an hour on this book go ahead. I'd just rather spend more time and money on another one."
3,Size doesn't matter,"Few, but EFFECTIVE, hints that stress on the importance of being clear and consise when defining objectives, praising or critisizing employees. Recommended."
2,A spark in the air,"After have been hearing about this book I was expecting something better. A couple of common sense ideas, nothing new. Obviosly a manager should be able to get the best from their people and that is only possible if you really rely on them and consider them able to supply ideas and knowledge. I can not understand how this book has so much hype. A couple of days after reading nothing new remained in my mind."
3,Hmm,I believe I bought this as a school text book. I don't even remember one thing about it. Sorry... maybe someone else can be more helpful.
2,At least it is short,"""The One Minute Manager"" purports to give the reader instructions on managing work and life. It does that, but the advise is so obvious and the instruction so superficial as to make reading even this short volume a waste of time.The advice is to give employees clear instructions, then praise them when they do well, and reprimand them when they do not. That is nearly the whole book. Now you don't have to read it.While this advise seems correct to me, it is also very obvious. I would think that any manager who does not already know this needs more help then this book can provide.In any case the book can not do much harm since it is short."
3,The One Minute Manager,"Blanchard provides great advice in a very easy to read book. Great gift for anyone who may be perceived as a ""micro-manager!"""
4,Some Simple Food for Thought,"Reward or punishment! Is this politically correct now-a-days. You bet not, but the idea is worth looking at and thinking about.There are some interesting ideas contained in the very short read. It will provide the beginning manager with a good base to develop their own style, but shouldn't be copied outright. The words ""reward"" and ""punishment"" should be re-worked so as not to offend those PC fanatics who cannot deal with older thinking. Also, comparing the trreatment of personnel to that of training a dog, well, it doesn't play well anywhere.I say give this book a read. Find some concepts that you can think about, and see if they can be applied to your present situation. If you spend more than 2 hours reading it, I'd be surprised. Use it as a brainstorming tool, not a How To book."
5,"A quick, worthwhile read","No need to go on at length about what countless others before me have said; this book is great. A bit expensive now, though, so I bought it used. Read in one sitting."
5,Worked for what I needed it for.,I bought this as a required reading for a promotional exam. It did its job and was a pretty good read as well.
5,Great common sense,The one minute manager is a quick read with valuable information.Understand and implement the steps described and you will automaticallybecome a better manager.
3,good principles,This book is a good refrence and building block to use with leadership. It would be a good method to use when you are strapped for time but not a every day rule.
4,Timely and Honest Feedback is the Key,"This classic is based on the premise that it doesn't take much to ""get very big results from people."" In fact, it takes about a minute... a well-timed minute. Start by setting goals with employees. Each goal should take no longer than a minute to read. The manager then looks for progress made toward the goals and ""catches people doing things right"" rewarding them with 1 minute of praise. Conversely, when things are not done well, the manager takes about a minute to reprimand the employee.Basically, it's about timely and honestly communicating with employees, a practice which is severely lacking virtually everywhere. If managers actually followed the simple advice of this book, there's no telling what they could accomplish. It's a quick, easy, and very beneficial read.-- Nick McCormick, Author, Lead Well and Prosper"
1,"I can't believe this book is a ""classic""","I normally don't understand how reviewers can give a book 1-Star when the majority of other reviewers have given it 5-Stars. I've assumed the 1-Star peeps just didn't ""get it"" or that they were exaggerating their low rating for effect.Unfortunately, I now find myself in that position. This book was horrible. I tried to pull some value from it, but it just wasn't in there. During the 30 minutes it took to read this (yes, it's that short), I found myself starting to feel bad for the authors. Kind of in the way you feel bad for a child that does something totally incorrectly, but her parents don't want to hurt her feelings, so they give unwarranted praise instead. But then I realized they've obviously made boatloads of money off of this thing, so now I just feel bad for everyone who has read it.Seriously, there are so many great business books out there. How this one has managed to sneak its way near the top is baffling."
1,Vendor sent wrong book,"I ordered ""The One Minute Manager"", I got ""Putting the One Minute Manager to Work"".I decided to keep it, but will am not pleased with Amazon on this order."
3,A little disappointing,"Yes, the 1 minute manager method is nice, and it can really work in certain conditions. But the books is too pretentious and the authors wrap the idea in way too many pages, just to fill a book.This kind of book should have half as many pages and sell for half as much."
2,Bloated with a few good ideas presented,This definitely feels to me like there were a few good ideas puffed up with lots of words and air to make a longer book. Anyone who needs this info doesn't need all that storytelling and wants the info in the most effective form not in some long drawn-out storyline. It also feels like it was a set-up for more books at big prices to present info that could have been presented effectively in one book. I am very glad I got this out of my local library instead of buying it!
3,Written like a childrens Barney book but effective,"If you're into the straight-forward approach, this book will drive you nuts. It's written in a mentor/student past experiences story structure. Comparable to a Chicken Soup of the Managerial Soul book, but without the emotional involvement. After reading a few chapters of ""then the young man asks the seasoned managerial veteran... so are you saying respect gets results?"", it's gets a little old. The technique behind the story makes it worth reading the very few pages this book is comprised of."
1,Thank you Captains Obvious for the groundbreaking ideas!,"The authors try to dress up common sense in a ""parable"" that will make anyone with any sense of the literary cringe. Don't waste your time on this unless you want to study how not to write a book. The writing is awful and the attempts to illustrate what they consider to be deep nuggets of wisdom are laughable. The book is corny in the sense of ""gee-golly-whiz Mr. Manager, duh, why didn't I see that. Boy oh boy, by gompers, you're so wise and I want to be just like you!"" Book summary: If you want to be effective at work, use common sense, be honest but fair in your praises and criticisms, and master some basic social skills. Really? Wow! That's deeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!"
2,Wise Old Man Advises Wide-Eyed Young Man - Enough Already!,"Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson birthed a monster writing style when they published THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, ""The Runaway #1 National Bestseller!"" -- and that style is surrounding a hideously boring topic with clichés, adverbs, adjectives, redundancies, dull characters, and exclamation points. The book is then called a nonfiction fable. Hunh?When this book came out in 1981 it used a new, perhaps fresh, approach to teaching management skills, but since then it has been copied and copied and copied ... when it should be put in a cage. It's time to stop dumbing down and start smartening up books for managers. Enough already!Note: You'll only need 1 minute to get what's useful out of this book."
2,Simplistic one-size-fits all advice. Don't bother.,Don't bother with this book that offers essentially one tip for dealing with all management challenges. Maybe that's all you can fit into one minute ...
2,"Lightweight, Little Content","The book assumes that the individuals you manage are essentially come fully equipped to do the job. However, most new (whether entry-level or expereinced) employees are unfamiliar with the nature of the enteriprise, its customers, and its measures for success. A good manager is also a good mentor and trainer, who spends more than ""a minute"" getting employees to learn how to make the right decisions while also giving them constantly challanging roles they can succeed in. The books spends little time on these important aspects. I would have appreciated this rather than the tedious conversational narrative. On the positive side, the suggested methods of praising and critiquing employees are worth noting."
4,Very quick read but a bit too basic,"This book is a very fast read and gives and overview to some nice concepts. Managing people is a bit more complicated than the book explains, so I consider this book and intro to see if you enjoy reading management books. If you like this book, then there are many more solid books out there to graduate to."
4,Read it but not necessary to buy it.,"The issue is that most of the managers are not effective.The conclusion is that if you use the One Minute technique, you can become very effective.The One Minute technique is:One Minute Goal setting- Take time to set major goals as that the employee knows what needs to be done.One Minute Praising- Praise your employees by catching them doing the RIGHT thingOne Minute Reprimand- First reprimand the BEHAVIOR, Second encourage the PERSON (shake hands)There are examples given to explain each point.This books is a bestseller because of it's simplicity. But subsequent books by the authors have acknowledged the need of more than the above 3 items.It is good in theory but it's practice demands much more."
4,Needs to be shared with all staff members,Great tips on establishing goals and giving feedback to staff members. I recommend sharing it with the staff so that they will recognize the change in management style and understand the motivation for it.
2,"It's full of good advices, but so obvius !!","A book is some strange because talks about things so obvius, but we all not remember all the times we need to deploy them !!"
5,This is reality!,"1 minute goal, 1 minute praising, and 1 minute reprimand can help you not only on your career but also in your personal life. This is a short book and very easy to read. The main idea is knowing what your outcome, catching people doing things right, catching people doing things wrong. Simple but convincing. At the end of the book, it does explain why these things work and why people function these way. Pleasure reading in 2 hours. Very helpful and practical!For the CD audio book version, it also includes an interview with Dr. Spencer Johnson about where did the 1 minute manager's idea come from and how did Dr. Johnson apply the idea on his daily life.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 07-Jan-2007)"
2,not from england...,This is made in Spain and not in England. You can buy the in the Indian/ Asian grocery for $6.99.
2,not made in England .. it's from Spain !!,Hi .. I purchased Nestle Cerelac Wheat 400g England .. But it's made in Spain !! Not from England !!
4,"Excellent Information, obviously biased","This is an excellent book for anyone involved in Category Management, seasoned pros and newbies alike.It is not surprising to see of the companies and people involved in this book. It's disappointing to get through it and not hear from some of the great companies doing great work today. More people should share what they're doing.The authors take great care to list the different tools used by each company. Kind in mind who who sponsored the book and realize that their are other tools at work in this industry.Mark it up and keep it around. It has a great index and will serve as a good reference tool."
3,Category Management,"If you want to win in the shelves, and add value (profit), start to think in this fundamental subject. The book is not complete and doesn't have a minucious (technical) aproach, but has good cases and ideas to how conduct this action in your business."
4,Clifford's First Valentine's Day Was Great!,Cliffords first Valentine's Day is a good book. It is best for kids the age of 4-6 because it uses small words. It is also easy for the children to comprehend. Clifford jumps into the mail cart and gets lost in the mail. I would recommend this book to any children interested in books. It is a good book.
3,received what I have ordered,"The ordered book was prompt delivered, it is visible that is was used but is o.k."
2,The Z-strap is not great...,"I love Skecher's shoes for my boys...they seem to withstand the beatings that the boys can dish out. But I bought these for my 2nd son for his ""back to school"" shoes since they were on sale, they were not laced shoes, and they were not white. He only wore them for 2 months before he was complaining on a daily basis that he couldn't get them ""tight"". After a week of this, I did look at them and he was right, the straps had started unraveling at the metal grommets, then they would get bound up in one spot instead of laying flat. We ended up buying him a new pair of Stride Rites at an outlet and he's been wearing those instead. We'll keep buying Skechers, but will definitely stay away from the ""Z-strap"" enclosures."
1,poor quality shoes,"I bought a pair of these shoes for each of my two boys.The first day my son wore these shoes one light stopped working.After taking a couple days to contact skechers [They have limited hours] the other shoe broke.Skechers then picked up the shoes and sent me new ones.This was a three week process.while waiting for those shoes my other sons lights stopped working.Now after just a week with the new shoes already one more pair has broken.I do not recomend buying these shoes.They are very cute when they work,but now all I have is dissapointed kids."
2,"Skechers Boys' S Lights - Energy 2 Lighted Sneaker,Black/Orange,11 M Youth",Dear customer service...One of the shoes that I bought doesn't work. I am not pleased with this purchase.I am really interests to buy a new pair of shoes but it worries to me the quality of the lights.Regards...Vanessa Aliendres
1,Real disappointing,"The cover art for this flick is fantastic. It is the highlight of the film.There is a nothing story about three guys into Internet porn, making music, eating, and hanging around looking beautiful in Speedos. There is a murder subplot, which is laughably filmed, like the rest of the movie. All of it is poorly done, poorly pieced together, and totally unsatisfying.It might be worth a rental to check it out. I would suggest you keep your finger on the fast forward button. No need to read the subtitles; the dialog barely matters. Generally, I'd recommend investing my time in something else."
2,Disappointing w/ meager story,"This was not a good film. The premise is less interesting than it sounds and the thin strands of story aren't plausible or that interesting. While the acting was ok (not great) and there were some attractive men on screen, it just wasn't a good enough storyline to be interesting. The central event that provides the conflict for the plot is somewhat confusing and the connection of the two lovers not believable.I think this studio can do better."
1,Nice Cover,"I think if I brought a couple of the cuties home from the bar, pulled out my camcorder, went on an exotic vacation, and used my Pinnacle editing program, I could have made a better movie. Cute guys, the rest was a mess."
1,Another half-baked gay themed film,"Three young Germans are hanging out in Brazil. They are a useless and aimless bunch, filling their days making lame pornos for the internet and celebrating moronic rap. (For me, that's enough to give any movie a zero rating.) The part of the story (the non-rap part) involving a love affair between one of the lads and a local is fitfully interesting. Beyond that, save your money."
1,"INSIP , HORRIBLE MOVIE","IF I COULD GIVE THIS FILM NO STARS I WOULD. THERE IS NO ""ACTING"" GOING ON HERE. NO PLOT. NOTHING. ALL I GOT OUT OF THIS MOVIE WAS SWINDLED FOR WHAT I PAID TO BUY IT. DON'T DO THE SAME!!!!!"
3,The Longing,I was expecting more gay sex between the guys in the film. This film is about guys traveling through Brazil. Not my kind of DVD. For the women this may be something you will like.
1,Poorly written with a condescending tone,"I have bought several pregnancy books, and this one is the most useless. The writing is choppy and a little awkward, and the tone is condescending toward women. This book is definitely not recommended."
5,Great book,"This book is a good reference book for pregnant women. My niece, Anslie Henderson, is the baby that the sonagram pictured on the second page of the ""Tenth Lunar Month"" shows, so I'm a little biased!"
1,Product not as described,The breakaway system came with no charger. I purchased the charger from eBay because it is easier than trying to return the item. Will think twice about using Amazon in the future!
4,"Great example of knitter's ""Bliss""","I just counted, I have 7 books by Debbie Bliss. That is probably why I found this book to be a bit less enchanting than I had expected it to be.I like her books - enjoy the layout and can always understand the instructions. However, within the body of her work, this set of designs just seemed a little too similar to some in her other books for me to get excited. As a stand alone book, it has charming styles.I still give it a 4 for good instructions, photography and cute styles."
5,"inspiring patterns, a bit difficult for new knitters.","My husband and I started knitting while expecting our first child. Ms. Bliss' books contain photos of beautiful sweaters, caps and dresses which are very inspiring. The most classically fashionable that I've ever seen, and surprisingly not impossible to make. We also own her ""Kids Country Knits"" which is great. My husband's first ever knitting project was a large stuffed sheep, and his second a beautiful sailor collar style sweater with a family of ducks knitted into the design. Both turned out great!!! These patterns are in the ""Kids Country Knits"". I made a cute hat and sweater set from the ""Classic Knits for Kids"". I recommend her books as the instructions are understandable, versatile and the small child sizes take a short time to make."
4,Worthwhile history,I've just started listening to the first volume and am appreciating it very much. The author relates the importance of history and identifies many of the elements of world culture and history that produced the U.S.A.. There is no such thing as an unbiased account of historical events. The publisher and author are open and honest about their points of view. There is no hidden agenda.
2,Misleading,"An avid PC point 'n' click fan, I was thrilled to find something that had been successfully converted to a GBA game. Reviews spoke of decent graphics and great transition of the puzzles for which p'n'c-ers are notorious. Sadly, it just didn't seem so. The graphics and entire gameplay reminded me of a text adventure and the first real puzzle didn't come about until I was halfway into the game. The only real similarity seemed to be in the use of items in conjunction with the environment. Gameplay wasn't intuitive as one was given multiple clues at a time, yet expected to follow only a specific one-- Both Spain and Syria are mentioned at one point; however, if you decide to hoof it to Spain, the game's over for you. Syria doesn't appear on the map, you lose without even the dignity of a ""Game Over"" screen.Essentially, ""Broken Sword"" seems to hold a lot of promise in terms of plot and adventure; but, as a hasty transition to the GBA system, it's just lost all its glitter."
3,i hate to rain on every1's parade but....,I didn't like this game as much as I thought I would. It was intresting enough but i beat it quickly with only a few problems(the thugs outside the hotel...and the hotel itself). Anyway it wasn't the worst i've played (if you've ever played mr.nuts you know what i mean). The graphics were great! I wasn't expecting that much on the graphic side. Anyways if you like games where you're fighting constantly then you won't like this game. Its nicely put together yet it wasn't as much fun as i thought. It requires a lot of thought; more than i wanted to put into it.overall:Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 7/10(no bugs:-) w/ little problems)Fun:4/10Storyline:9/10in my opinion it was fair.
1,Cannot even compare to the book!,"Terrible, terrible, just terrible! Ms. Isaacs, how can you letthem do this to your marvelous book! The plot, the actors justbutchered it. And don't even mention that Melanie Griffith. Linda Voss is supposed to be this confident, working girl but instead she made her out to be this wimpy, whispery-voiced wishy-washy sort of girl. Okay here is my advice. If you want to enjoy this movie, see it first then read the book by Susan Isaacs. You should look it up on Amazon too and see how highly it is recommended. I read it first and the movie was an unmitigated failure and disappointment to me. I could just cry thinking about it. I really wish they would make another movie out of it, but this time do it right and just follow the book which is just too perfect and which one cannot go wrong in following. Okay enough talk, read the book, forget the movie."
1,DVD DOES NOT work,DVD received but did not play at all in my DVD. Looked to be a recorded DVD from a region other than the US. Emails to the company regarding this product were not answered. Do not order from this company!
3,Ooops!,Somehow there was a miscommunication between how the seller presented this DVD & my reading what was written!! This DVD doesn't play on my player (or the players of 2 friends). One friends player said it would only play: & it named 3-4 foreign countires.? So I'll be returning it to seller & (hopefully) getting another.
1,One of the worst movies in years!,"The plot - silly. The dialog - turgid, clunky, overdone. The acting - bland. About the only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad its really funny in parts."
3,Not bad,"I have a low tolerance for Melanie Griffith; her voice usually gets on my nerves. But here, she's not bad as a strong-willed half-Jewish secretary who falls in love with her boss, a WWII American spy,(Michael Douglas) and persuades him to let her spy as well. Nothing here is overly impressive, and there are some major mistakes, including the fact that Douglas' character doesn't speak any German! Still, a light, enjoyable film."
5,One of my favorite WWII movies,"This movie reminds me so much of the movies that were made during WWII. There is an innocence about it that is endearing. My husband and I watch it and we do laugh about the impossiblity of it, but every time we get totally wrapped up in all over again. It is very much like the movies that the main character is in love with. Let go of reality and enjoy. It is a movie after all."
3,Good directing Bad casting,"The direction of this film was beautiful and the story, although implausable holds your attention. The casting of Melanie Griffith was in my opinion unfortunate.Although she is quite appealing in this role she is unconvincing.Her character is supposed to speak German fluently and ""pass"" for German-having a mastery of the language skilled enough to mimic a lower class German dialect - Yet in the German scenes she speaks in that little-girl-whispery AMERICAN accented voice! This was totally distracting and all but ruined the plausibility of the character. I kept thinking,""Why can't she do a German accent? Why didn't they get Meryl Streep??"""
3,Shining Through - surprisingly good,"Great viewing, right to the end. I had not seen this movie on the big screen, so I can't compare the effect, but at home the sets and cinematography came across really well on the TV. Great cast, story exciting without being too unrealistic, apart from the somewhat melodramatic ending on the Swiss border, but overall, a really enjoyable movie. I'm glad I bought it."
1,This story smells like Hollywood..,"This movie is an insult to the real spies, the men and women who parachuted into Germany and risked their lives to scrape some information.The real spies were NOT charming little secretaries serving under charming handsome officers.They WERE everything from prostitutes to clever liars. They usually lasted from 0.5-2 months before they were caught. And when they were caught they were 1. Tortured 2. Interrogated 3. either sent to concentration camps/shot/or made to work for the germans.In all this movie is everything but real."
1,Horrible,"This movie is ""supposedly"" based on the book ""Shining Through"" by Susan Isaacs. The only thing in common is the name of the characters, everything else was completely changed. Everything that was good about the book was ruined in the movie. When I watched it all I could do was laugh because all of the suspense in the ending was said out right within 5 minutes of the movie starting. Susan Isaacs should have never approved this movie for it does not relay any of the greatness of the book. If you liked the book I don't advise watching the movie. I am greatly displeased by this movie."
5,Shining Review for Shining Through,"Loved this movie. Loved the twists and turns it took. Loved the suspense...never was sure of how it would end, and even the ending was a bit of a surprise. Wish they made more movies like this."
4,Good Movie Would be better without Melanie Griffith,"I agree with the reviewer who said that this movie was cast badly. Melanie Griffith is very unconvincing though she gets an ""A"" for effort. Very exciting movie otherwise."
1,You won't like it if you loved the book.,"I loved the book, and this movie was a huge disappointment to me. The Ed Leland character is completely destroyed."
4,"SPY, SUSPENSE, THRILLER, AND FABULOUS LOVE INTEREST","A love affair between an American spy and his secretary During WW2 is taken to Germany behind enemy lines when German scientists are suspected of developing a very destructive bomb. A Fabulous romantic love story with great actors, a fantastic background sceneries and great costumes. A very enjoyable movie.The quality of the DVD is good. One minus though, this DVD comes almost without any additional features."
3,An ok suspense thriller with weak acting,"If you can't stand hearing Melanie Griffith's non-stop baby-talk voice throughout, then you may become annoyed with this somewhat old-fashioned WW2 espionage romance from 1992. She got on my nerves with her voice. Michael Douglas doesn't do much more than look stoic throughout here. Liam Neeson has a nice early turn as a Nazi who takes in Griffith as a maid, only she is a spy. If you can believe that she is a German Jew, then I guess you can believe anything. This is very slow off the ground, and doesn't pick up any suspense at all until more than half-way in when we finally get into Nazi Germany and the only question is will the good guys beat the bad guys? We always know the answer, however, because the structure of the film is a flashback, told from the present when the two lovers are telling their tale to the modern BBC. This is an oldie, but it's ok for a weak moment."
4,An Absorbing Spy Story,"Michelle Pfiffer does an outstanding job in her role as the spy who goes behind enemy lines to find the secrets behind GErmany's new rocket program. Although the story plot may be somewhat unrealistic, it does not affect the drama and intrigue of the movie. Michael Douglas always delivers a solid performance, but it is more in a supporting role to Pfiffer. The movie held my interest and is one I want to see again."
4,Underrated movie,"If you haven't caught this one, it's definitely worth seeing. Intrigue and romance set against the terror of WWII. One of Melanie Griffith's better performances, and Michael Douglas and Liam Neeson, well, they're always good."
5,GREATTTTTTTT Movie!!!,One of my favorite all time love stories!!! Love the setting of World War II and the drama of those days. Love conquers all!!! Good wins over evil!!!! I'll continue to recommend it to my friends.
3,"Not as bad as I heard it was, in fact it's pretty good!","I just saw this movie for the first time. I confess i only wanted to see it because I heard it was terrible and thought it would be kinda fun for that reason. I was pleasantly suprised to find it is a pretty good suspense/drama. Melanie griffith is not bad, despite her babydoll voice. Michael Douglas is kinda stiff though. The film is beautifully directed and photographed. Not so bad after all."
2,"Not Indian, say expatriate writing","Very slanted in its choice of the authors, the book can hardly claim to be representative of Indian writing. Indo-English writing is a miniscule portion of Indian writing, both in quality and quantity, this fact has not been addressed in the editorial choices."
1,Worst. Economics. Text. Ever.,"This really is the worst Economics textbook I have ever encountered. This 466-page soft cover text is absolutely miserable, both in terms of clarity and organization. In addition, many fundamental concepts are not present in the text - the author cites them as ""beyond the scope of this book."" The book even resorts to bad grammer and poor editing in places. The level of incompetence on the part of the text's author is truly astonishing."
1,Do not accept returns.,"My son ordered a hat and when he tried it on it did not fit. They would not accept a return. So much for good customer service!! I wouldn't buy from these folks unless you are absolutely sure the cap will fit. By the way, my son has a similar cap that fits him fine and that's what he went by when ordering a new one. Evidently, ""authentic"" doesn't work when it comes to cap sizes."
3,Decent but not perfect,"Honestly, the cap is made decent and I bet you will feel really comfortable wearing it. However, it is not the fashionable type since the height is not satisfactory and you will find some trouble making your own swag."
1,Outdated.,"Unless you are using Cocoon 2.1.x or earlier, you are better off trying to learn from online tutorials or by asking questions at an online Cocoon forum. Relative to other Cocoon books available, this one is very good. Relative to 2008 and the release of Cocoon 2.2, this book is almost useless."
4,A great tool to become used to Cocoon.,"Besides the necessary introductory work (performed nevertheless in an organic and rational way) the book is a real ""hands on"" manual. Useful for most of real-world applications.Chapter 16 on Databases saved me a long work to retrieve otherwise sparse informations from the net.A great lecture for 'self-teachin night owls'."
4,"Fascinating, enaging simulation, atrocious customer service",It is a shame that such a fascinating and often captivating simulation is undermined by the lack of customer service. It is one thing to have to download patches (this is to be expected as problems arise in a Windows-platform environment). But it is entirely another not to receive any response when contacting both the technical support and customer service departments of the manufacturer. Generally solid software is apparently supposed to make up for a complete absence of support and simple courtesy. But it does not.
1,It was designed for win 95 and wont run right in XP,I don't5 know if it'll run in anything else. Dosbox doesn't work and the compatablility wizard doesn't work on it either. It starts up then your tank goes up the road a little ways and as the view changes the program crashes. I got my money back for it.
4,Neat Alarm Clock Radio,"This is a very neat small footprint alarm clock radio. To be noted is that the clock has a digital display (Red LED), however, the radio tuning is analog. Therefore if you live in an area where the radio stations are fairly congested, you may encounter difficulty in tuning to the exact station that you want. There is an FM antenna (black wire) attached that can be stretched out so that a stronger signal can be obtained.Here are the specifications for this unit:- Frequency Range: AM530-1710KHz; FM88-108MHz- Output Power: 400mW- Speaker Impedance: 8 ohms- Battery Back-up: 9v Battery (for clock - not included)- Power source: AC 120V/60Hz, 5WattsThis device works well, is easy to use and its buzzer is pretty loud and will wake up even the soundest sleeper. I recommend it."
3,Not challenging enough,"My current fitness level is less than satisfacory and yet I found this video too easy. My abs, buns and thighs weren't even a bit sore the day after.The video is mostly aerobic, and good for a short routine during the day, but for body sculpting - not enough."
3,Good for beginners ONLY!,"The video has two separate 25 minutes work-outs, with aerobic and exercises for hips,buns and abs.I bought this video when I was 16 and had never exercised before. The first times I couldn't complete the full 25 minutes, but after doing it every day for a couple of weeks I could see my tighs getting firmer. After a year, I started joging etc and stopped using the tape.Now I'm 20. At the end of this summer i picked up the tape agin and began exercising with it. It's really not a challenge if you're not a beginner anymore. Now, I do both of the separate 25 minutes work-outs together, but still don't feel I've got a good workout. The exercises for legs and bun are quite good, but Jane pays too little time on the abs. The instructors are very sweet and keep you motivated, but I would only recommend it for beginners."
3,I was disatisfied.,"This video is supposed to contain excercises to sculpt your abdominals, buns, and thighs, the problem is they spend little time doing exackly that! They spend half of each 25 minute workout doing stupid aerobics, that hardly raise your heart rate, and don't make you sweat. The thigh work is fairly good. The buns are worked once and way too fast. This video is not good for sculpting your abs at all, they do that way too fast, and last thing. Overally, this video is not for sculpting your abs,or buns. if you want a good lower body video, try Jane Fonda's Lower Body Solution, stay away from this one."
5,Excellent,This is a great workout if you are trying to target that troublesome lower body. Really great muscle toning for the hard to reach abs-especailly the lower ab region. There are also toning for the legs and buns. Jane incroporates aerobics in with the toning exercises which makes the workout even more effective. Buy this video.
5,Fantastic,"I have tried many workout tapes in my lifetime but this one is the best. You really get a workout in just 25 minutes and if you have the series then you can go right from the abs, buns and thighs workout right into body sculpting or low impact aerobics and give yourself a great 50 minute workout. The moves are easy to learn, the camera doesn't jump around and you can actually see what your supposed to be doing instead of looking at just faces.I would recommend this tape (plus the other two) highly."
1,Libral Bias,"This book was assigned in a class, and was one that I wish we had not read. Some good points, but just not worth reading through the one-sided arguments. I am not a Flat-Earth conservative righting this either, so take the advice and do not read this, unless for a class."
1,Tasteless and pathetic,"A little too much graphic sex and too little romance. I am a romance writer and definetly no prude but there's a fine line between vulgar and tasteful. This story is just plain vulgar. It's like Penny Jordan couldn't find anything else for the characters to do so she just writes a lot of smut until Julia gets knocked up and Silas admits he loves her. The gist I also got from this story is that they're distant relatives, grossness! Plus Silas is egotistical and way too pushy. There's nothing wrong with being a modern day girl who enjoys sex but Julia just sounds like a sl*t instead of a likable heroine. Want a better read with tasteful sex scenes? Then read Fugitive Fiancee by Kristin Gabriel or Father by Choice by M.J. Rodgers or the Wedding Planners trilogy by Darcy Maguire. They're written better without a lot of smut like this book!"
2,Penny Jordan lets u down,"I found the story very silly.First: Its not romantic.Second:The heroine is very vain.Three: The language doesn't look like Penny Jordan, it sounded cheap especially when the heroine says baby grub and talkes about her vibrator Roger.These books are supposed to be silly likable love stories, then of talking about about vibrators etc."
3,How to put a reader off,"I like Penny Jordan, and I usually like all her books. But Suzy has put me off this one by telling me the heroine is some vacuous airhead who likes Sex and the City and shoes, and who is 'bold in bed' (a real turn on - not.) So, guess I'll wait for the next one in this trilogy. Maybe the heroine in that one will be a litte more appealing. I've given the book three stars as I'm sure, since it's Penny Jordan, it will be well written anyway."
4,"this version of tapestry not ""original""","Great album in its original form, but this is not the originalversion. For example, the original, released by Mediarts in1970 has the best version of ""Castles In The Air "" which wasfaster ( running time 2:50 )and featured great finger-pickingand singing. Don Mclean did not like the version, and theslower version, complete with awful strings and drums has takenit's place on many of his "" best of "" recordings. I believethe wonderful song "" No Reason For Your Dreams "" has beentampered with also. I know you can get the original versionon vinyl, and EMI Records boasts you can find it in their""legendary artists series "", but I have not seen it.Bottom line : wonderful album if you can get the actualoriginal version. Let the buyer beware : I just paid $20for the 'ORIGINAL RECORDING FROM MASTER COPY 'and it isnot the original album. These record companies need to stopremastering these gems unless they can stick to the ORIGINALformat."
5,We love Don McLean!,"At one time, we had all of McLean's records but over the years, they have been misplaced or lost. Now, we have started a new collection. Tapestry is a key CD for that collection. Thanks."
2,More of a black comedy than a sequel,Despite the title this seems like a black comedy because the morbid sense of humor and who the killer makes jokes and kills people.The movie is a flashback of part 1 and has Billy's brother Ricky telling a doctor why his brother killed for and then Ricky escapes from the hospital and goes on a killing spree.The murders are laughable(A man gets a umbrella through his stomach and a teen gets car jacks in his mouth and his eyeballs explode.The whole movie is weird and not for all tastes or not for the squeamish but this one is much better than part 3 and 4.The movie is 88 minutes with 40 minutes of flashbacks
2,May I use your Umbrella?,"....those of you who have seen this movie will get my title. I think the Umbrella scene was just fantastic! In this sequel, we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie. Which is a very good B movie, it was even picketed for it content..you know a movie is good if people wanna get rid of it. Anyways, so we have Eric Freeman playing the younger brother, haunted by flash backs from the first movie (which this movie has alot of flashbacks), he begins a rein of terror in a santa claus suit, as did his brother. all the b movie elements are evident here. bad acting, nudity, sex, killing, blood, etc. I recommend this movie to anyone that has seen the 1st one. The 3rd isn't bad either. Stop there. 4 and 5 have nothing to do with the first 3."
4,since I haven't seen the original....,"i didn't mind the flashback scenes so much, they were pretty interesting and it looks like the original was unjustly picketed on and ignored..it looked really intense and suspenseful... I enjoyed this movie alot, but the middle scenes were sort of driving me crazy, i guess because i was in a bad mood, but things quickly began to pick up and by the end i was really fascinated by the movie..it was great, the acting was a bit annoying and there really was too much of the first one, which was cmpletely unneccesary, but i enjoyed it..."
4,More silent and more deadly!!,"Being Christmas time I felt it appropriate to review a Christmas movie. And what better Christmas movies are there than the Silent Night Deadly Night Series? I know what your saying, But Steve, why choose the second film to review when the first one is far superior? Well I'll tell you why! Because this movie is essentially just the first movie done in flashbacks with 15 to 20 minutes of extra footage added. That's right these guys made a whole sequel and only had to spend enough money to film a few minutes of extra scenes. Pure genius and that's what I like in a horror movie...blood, guts and brains (and Santa Claus if it's at all possible) So remember when deciding which Silent Night Deadly Night to watch, go for number 2 because it's two film in one!"
3,This video and the original need to be on DVD!,"This movie is pretty good, but not as good as the first. I really like that there is alot of flash back scenes from the first movie. Ricky would make his brother proud. His skills in killing are superb, almost out doing his late brother Billy. This movie and the first in the series are great horror movies. Not so much because they were scary(which they really are not) but because they show some good gore and that they are freakin funny. I think that it is important that these movies be transfered to DVD. It needs to be done. These movies are hard to come by as it is. Especially the first one. There are more and more old B movies going into DVD and I think these two classics need to be on the list. Punishment is necessary! It is good. It is absolute.Psycho"
3,"Silent Night,Deadly Night 2","Ricky Caldwell(the psychotic younger brother of the killer in the first Silent Night), is in a mental institution, he tells his whole life story, as well as his brother's. His doctor soon figures out that to Ricky, starting a new life means avenging his brother's death any way he knows how, wheather it means, shoving an umbrella through a man's chest, electricution with jumper cables, a rampage with a gun, and getting revenge on Mother Superior, the women who is responsible for turning Ricky and his brother into what they became. This movie was what I like to call ""funny horror"". There were no actors in this film that you can see in any other movies, but it was pretty funny. END"
2,Garbage Day!,"Well, if you've seen the first one, don't waste your time here, it's pretty much all the footage from the first one with about 20 minutes of horrible new stuff edited in with it. The only thing enjoyable about this movie is the incredibly horrible acting. Particularly ""Garbage Day!"""
2,2 1/2 stars,"Ricky, little brother of the previous films Santa Clause killer. Picks up where Billy left off. Around half of the movie shows scenes from Part 1, but the new scenes that are here a pretty good. See a guy get backed over, and a guy killed with a battery charger. Good stuff!"
2,Needs repair every two years,"We've had our Solis SL90 for 6-7 years now. It makes great tasting beverages, but - it's been in for repair 3 times already. Twice the control board stopped working properly, not heating the machine. Each repair cost around $100. For a $500 product from Switzerland, I would expect more reliability."
5,"Great product, great value","For those who like espresso and/or espresso-based lattes and the like, a truly great espresso machine improves your life every day. Especially if you don't have to spend a fortune, as with this machine .This is a great device, well-designed, easy to use and sturdy. The variable setting - more or less water per serving- is a great feature, as you'll find you want different strengths at different times. Plus I go for a stronger espresso than my wife prefers.Solis SL 90 is highly recommended. There are no design or feature flaws that we can see.ps: grind your beans in a separate burr grinder of your choice. Fully automated devices aren't worth the extra cost just to add grinding."
5,We are all intellegent enough to read this book!,"This is about something that everyone should be aware of and interested in. It is our life on this planet! He is very honest and raw! I am glad to see more people writing about things that matter and for so long have been ignored. Wake up people! This is the real life!!Please read this book, and share it!Carol : )PS Thanks Derrick"
2,Mediocre book buries good ideas,"This work reads like a transcript of a conversation with a stoned guy sitting on the couch who's worried about the environment. I wanted to like this; I thought Jensen was supposed to be a dangerous, radical thinker who strikes at the bedrock of civilization. The book might as well have been two sentences: ""We're destroying the planet because we can't recognize it as a living thing that communicates with us and of which we are a part. Let me tell you about this really cool thing that happened with me and some animals one day."" Jensen's critique might posture as radical, but his largely humorless tone never rises above mild concern and his language is lackluster. I suspect that might be the point: the book's mediocrity is intentional, seeking the lowest common denominator."
5,I jolt to the spirit!!,"I want to thank Derrick for writing this inspiring book. I give him a lot of credit for his honesty; for the ideas contained inside are connected with so many aspects of his life, what is going on in America and on Planet Earth. He brings attention to practices and thought patterns that many people have chosen to ignore.After reading this, I began to practice listening to the language of Nature even more, and all of the things that she is communicating to me.This is an excellent read!!!"
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"I can't go on enough about this book. It should be required reading in colleges and for those in all levels of government, Wall Street and industry CEOs.The writing is excellent. Many of its passages read like prayers. I can't think of topics and subjects more important than those Jensen writes about -- our cultures diconnection from the natural world and from ourselves and how it has impacted our mental and spiritual health and the health of the earth.Jensen is so passionate about these topics that he does repeat certain ideas, BUT instead of ruining it, I think the non-linear trajectory of his book actually enhances his message.The first half of the book where he discusses problems can be hard-hitting and difficult to get through certain parts of it, BUT please hold fast through the end. It is worth it.Jensen's eloquence and wisdom are best when he is also discussing answers, or possibilities, as it were.www.corimorenberg.com"
5,Diddo - One of the most deeply-moving books I've ever read!,"This book will change the way you perceive, feel and think about everything. So beautifully written it brought tears to my eyes several times."
3,school,i needed this book for a class that i was enrolled in at a community college. i found the book hard to get into. to me it wasn't interesting. order shipped fine. good condition.
5,Excellent reference for Connecticut family research.,"This book contains family lineages to hundreds of Connecticut families! I was able to track 200 years of records for my families: Hall, Ives, Mix, Moss, and others. If you have roots in Connecticut, you need this book!"
2,It seems unreliable,"I wanted an inexpensive caliper for the occasional DIY project. That is what this is, nothing more. The build quality is low. It simply does NOT feel reliable. I would not use it for anything that requires a precise measurement. I have not yet decided if I will return it or not. I need to test it for a few days."
4,"A bit cheap construction, still worth more than the price","Construction feels a bit cheap, lighter than high quality top-brad calipers, not very smooth finish. Plastic edge does not line up at 0 exactly, which it is supposed to, but it has digital reading so I can do without manual reading(atleast until digital dial keeps working). When I hold it I get black residue on hand, I hope it is graphite used for lubrication and not lead. Having said that, it does work, comes with an extra battery, nice case and a port to connect to computer!!! This is certainly more than I expected for the price."
5,6 inch caliper,this digital caliper is well worth the money. its works good and is very accurate. it came in a nice hard case and battery included. would recommend it to anybody. also very satisfied with amazon.(as always) they shipped it for free and it only took a couple of days till it arrived.
4,"For the price, great product.","As it states in the title, for the price great product. Seems to be accurate up to .01. When testing the same object, no deviation from the original measure up to .01.Only issues, it is what you pay for. It feels a little cheap, but that's ok. Doesn't feel as if it will break. Issue, and why it is only 4 stars is the roller on it is all but inoperable. Other than that, comes in a good case, extra battery, and seems nice...again, for the price."
1,Cheap product cheaply made,I returned this caliper after I saw how badly made it was. The display was fine but the adjusting knob was wobbly even when tightened. It was a big heavier than I thought it would be. I didn't like using it and would not recommend it.
3,looks great,"this works just fine, but I guess its quality is equal to its price.no problemsIt good for occasional uses, but I'm no expert"
5,Love it,"This tool I purchased because I started to reloading my own ammo and this is the perfect tool to use to measure my ammo. The price was great, and I could not pass it up."
1,Guess got what I paid for!,"This cheap digital caliper is exactly that. The quality if horrible. The rails are very course not smooth so it jumps. The display fades in and out as the distance changes. Be sure to only measure where it wants to work, not where you need. Buy two for the people your dislike."
2,poor quality control,"I have ordered two of these calipers, but not intentionally: the first was damaged, so I returned it and ordered another. Guess what? The second one was damaged, too.The first had a cracked shaft (the shaft is what the piece with the LCD slides along), and the second has a bent shaft. I unfortunately waited too long (> 30 days) to return the bent one, so I guess I'm stuck with it. You pretty much get what you pay for here: a cheap way to pretty accurately measure stuff. For most of my needs, even with the inaccuracy from the bent shaft, it'll probably do fine. It does irk me that both were damaged, however, so I'm dinging it a few stars."
3,"good accuracy, don't get damp!","you get what you pay for. good price on caliper, kinda flimsy spinner, don't get it damp - makes it jump readings"
1,DOA,"This caliper arrived defective, and returning it to Amazon was free and without hassle. The unit does look very nice, it's a shame it wasn't tested before being shipped. My use for this wasn't for critical measuring, so it would have worked perfectly for my purposes."
1,The Digital Caliper Did not work!,I am very disatisfied! I purchased this as a Christmas present. We got a call 2 days later saying it did not work! I tried to contact Apex Tools and they never returned my calls! Now I am stuck with a product that does not work and that I cannot return because no one has returned my call!
4,Very nice for the price,"This was NOT the digital caliper I ordered, however, the features matched my needs. I give the item itself 4 stars. The seller received a separate rating. This is a very good digital caliper...smooth operation...and has the capability for data-cable use (though a data-cable was NOT supplied with the caliper). It can switch from millimeters to inches...making it very versatile. The extra battery was a plus. BTW...the Pit Bull caliper was the one I ordered, but I was sent a ""Carrera Precision"" caliper (by Max Tool; [...]) instead. Luckily, this caliper had the same features as the Pit Bull...with the exception that the Carrera has a black surface (not silver)."
1,Not as described,"The caliper claimed to have two batteries, but came with just one. I would like to receive the other battery."
1,Didn't work,"This caliper would come on only if I played with the battery and held the cover by hand. I tried adjusting the battery contacts, but the same thing happened. Even when I did get it to work (briefly) the zero'ing seemed flakey at best... it would zero, but then I'd use it, close it, and see that it was no longer at zero. I have since returned this one (Amazon was awesome on the return, as usual) and I'm now trying another brand, the Wixey WR100 6-Inch Digital Calipers with Fractions (sold directly by Amazon) which is more money, but hopefully better quality... plus it does fractions which will be handy."
2,Defective,"Might be a good deal for the price if it worked. Mine came and it was already turned on. When I try to turn it off it doesn't and actually adds to the number on the digital display. I tried the spare battery just in case this was a low battery problem and that didn't help.When I could get it to work it did appear to be accurate 80% of the time. Sometimes though it would go out of whack.I really like the price and the product seems good, which is why I gave it 2 stars. It seems sold and I figure that I just got a bad one which is possible with any product. I'm thinking of ordering another to see if I have better luck with the second."
5,My first digital caliper,I purchased this caliper to reach the $25 cut off to get free shipping. I use it for fun to figure out the exact thickness or case size of my watches.It does exactly what it says it does and came very quick. I mean a digitial caliper for recreational use for $12-$13?!? You can't go wrong. You will not be dissapointed with this purchase. I know I wasn't!
5,Great value for the money!,"6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper with Extra Battery and CaseI bought this digital caliper about a month ago and using it everyday.It is not the sturdiest caliper but it is perfect for my woodworking jobs.And I am quite happy with the low price.After seeing it, my friends also wanted it. So I ordered five more.Two minor comments:1) When I ordered it first time, Amazon sent me a caliper without any colorcoating. But five additional calipers I just received are black-coated asshown in the product photo. Functionwise, I believe they are the same.2) I could not find any quality check certificate for any of them which wasmentioned by a reviewer.PS: I have been using this caliper almost everyday for several months. So far,so good. The original battery is still working! I think it was one of the bestwoodworking tool investment I have made up until now along with the Incra T-Rule."
4,The 6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper,This is a handy item. It came in a protective case and works well. The extra batterys are a nice touch.
4,Nice product,It is a wonderful product at an unbelievably low cost. Enjoyed the buying experience very much. Expecting many more such low cost quality items in the years to come.
3,Adequate,"I chose this particular caliper largely because of its inexpensive price. I only use it a couple of times a week and it has been working well. It does not feel as well crafted as my old caliper and I might have some qualms about its build quality if I was a very heavy user. But for the occasional user, the combination of price and the extra battery and case makes this a good value."
5,Accurate Caliper,"I bought this caliper for use in racing radio controlled cars. It is consistent and accurate for my needs. I'm not sure if it would be accurate enough for a machinist, per se, but for most it is an excellent measuring tool."
4,Digital Caliper,"Nice Addition for my Mechanical Tools ,Large Display Digital Awesome, Not Continually Lookimg for Glasses Any More, Saving Time. The Locking Set Screw Holds True From Piece to Piece for Meas'g. Conversion in. / mm. Good Feature Also."
2,Not Great,"If you need accurate, repeatable measurements, you will probably want to look somewhere else. It does not inspire confidence when you zero your caliper and it will not even repeat the measurement of zero. I would trust this for a good ballpark measurement but that is not really the level of accuracy required when I reach for a caliper."
5,good calipers for the price,If you consider the price these calipers are pretty good. They feel fairly sturdy and are accurate enough for what I need. I saw complaints about battery life in some of these calipers but my battery has held up well. The simple plastic case is fairly sturdy and well padded but you might need to put a rubber band around it to keep it closed if you want to throw it in a toolbox.
2,cheap version,this thing is effective but it is cheap as reflected in the price. It got the job done but sometimes the measurement would jump from one value to another. Unless you really dont want to spend the money i would recommend getting a nicer quality one.
5,Good deal!,I had been needing a caliper to work on projects for some time. I finally reached a point to where I couldn't proceed without one. I ordered this one from Amazon and was surprized by the quality for such a low price.
2,"Ordered new, but received poorly refurbished.","The calipers I ordered were supposed to be new and unused. The item I received was nicked, scratched, and even slightly bent. The whole unit was dirty and did not slide smoothly. It appeared as though a used unit was refurbished (poorly) and repackaged before it was sold. I am very disappointed with this item and would not recommend it to other people."
5,Excellent Value,How can you go wrong for $10. The item works very good and comes with a case and extra battery but be careful the LCD will turn on if the jaws open so lock it and turn it off when in storage.
5,Good caliper for the price,"I don't even remember what I paid for it. I have really been impressed with this thing. Easy to use - turns on automatically, turns off automatically, use the thumb wheel or just pull to use, can still be used even without batteries. Solid case."
4,Eh...Good for the price,"It works ok, some of the parts feel loose, the slider mainly, the case is easily broke. It fell from a three foot desk and a hinge broke first day I had it. Luckily the Caliper wasn't in the case."
1,From M.E. student,"This digital caliper sucks! First off you have to extend the caliper extremely slow for it to be somewhat accurate. When it ""skips"" it gives no error like other ones do. It just gives you a wrong reading. This caliper sucks, don't buy this crap."
4,Good accuracy,"Good accuracy and repeatable results. Quality is not great, but for the price and use I will need it is good enough."
1,Cheap! You get what you pay for!,"I am pretty upset that the first person who reviewed this item is the person who convinced me to buy it. The calipers are not smooth and they don't come with a certificate of calibration, which pretty much renders these completely useless unless you are using this for your own hobby at home and don't need them to be calibrated. Do not use these if you are an engineer who needs verification that these are calibrated."
2,bad quality caliper,"This item arrived with an extra piece of broken plastic inside the box, the item itself wasn't broken but the rolling piece that is use to move the caliper is loose and very low quality."
2,not very accurate,I am sorry to say that this caliper is not very accurate. I know for a fact that some of the beads I buy may vary slightly however not to the point this caliper says and trust me Swarovski Crystals are pretty darn accurate in size when they say 8mm it is 8mm so on these other beads I do not know if I should go up or down in number and I need the number for my program in the computer
1,Do not but this Caliper!!!! zero points jumps off by 0.2 inch in and out!!,"If I can, I will put in 0 star for this caliper. It has no stable zero point, every time I zero it in and measure something and come back to zero, it jumps off by either 0.2 inch, 0.4 inch, or 0.6 inch. It's accuracy is worse than a 30-feet tape.I do not believe that Amazon allows this kind of product to be sold on its website.What a shame!!"
4,Works well,"Very accurate, with a nice digital display. Just what I wanted. Needed a set for my reloading bench, and they are it."
5,cheap and accuarate!!!,For the price this unit was exactly what I needed. Both batteries that came with it were in fine shape and the carrying case is a nice touch. I bought this for my reloading set but have found many more uses for it. Cheap and accurate what more could you ask for?
3,its ok,"when I recieved this 6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper with Extra Battery and Case there was a screw on the blade guide that was not correctly installed, the performance of the product was impacted. I was able to re-tap the hole and install a new screw. after the repair, the caliper worked as expected."
4,Works well after you replace the batteries,"All the batteries supplied with this was too low in charge (it came with a set of spare one and a set installed). It took me a while to figure out why i kept getting inaccurate readings, different even when measuring the same item. After replacing the batteries the measurement readings were much more stable. I compared this to a mm ruler I have and it seemed to be accurate. It measures in millimeters and inches. This is a great unit, for the price it cannot be beat!"
5,caliper,I have been using master craftsman tools for over 40 years. I found it hard to believe that for under $20 you could find an instrument that could do what some of my $100 instruments could do. I am impressed.
4,Surprising Quality,I was surprised at the quality when I received the caliper. It is sturdy and very easy to use. The digital display is easy to read and it seems to be very accurate. The extra battery is nice also.
5,Works great,"The item shipped as described and came quickly, great product. very precise and the digital readout works like a charm."
4,Cheap but useful,These calipers are really great for just around the house but they are cheaply made. I didn't pay very much for them so that would explain it but they work well and come with a decent case!
3,Works if you don't need precision,"This works however it's not very accurate. It's close but not close enough for my needs, it may be ok for those that are not working with tight tolerances."
2,Worth what you pay for it - no more!,"If you think there's some magic and you're getting a precision digital caliper for $9, think again. This is a steel ruler that happens to have a digital readout. I guess the precision would be enough for some applications (e.g., wood carpentry) but I would not recommend it for precision mechanical or electronic applications. In particular, the depth gauge feeler on mine was slightly bowed and did not fit precisely in the guides for it, making accurate measurements with it impossible. Lesson learned, I'm coughing up $85"
1,Warning: Caliper from VXB Bearing not the same caliper,The calipers being shipped by VXB Bearing are a cheap knockoff that is not calibrated and has to be manually turned off.
3,OK price for low level quality,Had to clean the guides because full of particles from machining. Warped. Still ok for the price. Used WD40 to protect from corrosion.
2,"Not happy, even for ~$10 shipped","My 'copy' came from a bearing place. The case had a white label sticker on it - slapped on there crooked telling you to turn off the device, with their website on it.The case was scratched and dented - clearly used.The caliper itself was bent along the rule... enough to affect sliding.Buy a different, more consistent 'cheapo' caliper!!!"
3,6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper,"I am very pleased with the digital caliper. It was received promptly and the features are excellent. After working with a composite laminate caliper for so long, this is very pleasant to use. It has the feel and ease of use of a quality tool."
3,"Caliper okay, batteries dead & defective",The product shipped and arrived in an expeditious manner. The calipers were as advertized. The reason I gave it a middle of the road rating was because the battery that was installed in the unit lasted all but 15 minutes. The spare battery that also shipped as advertized was completely corroded and unusable. I ordered six units and had to replace all 12 batteries (installed and spare). That is unacceptable!
3,nice deal,Great tool for the price. I am knocking some stars off because the case is super cheap and was broken when I got it. Amazon paid for the return shipping and refunded my money. I will reorder it and see how it goes.
1,Used and abused,"I was looking forward to using this tool, but when I grabbed a brand new production bullet, the numbers were way off. I measured some 9mm brass and again, the measurements were way off ! I decided to give a closer look and found it looked slightly used, I also saw in the instructions that if it's inaccurate, then it needs to be cleaned ! I followed the instructions and found oil, dust, grit and judging from the wear on the metal, it looked like it was used HEAVILY before it was returned and then sold to me as new !Sadly, this wasn't a fair review of the product but more of the Return and QA people at the company that sold it to me. Amazon made the return very easy, which has made up for the mistake, this time ! I'm going to go out and buy a NEW one in person because I need this yesterday !"
5,Great so far!,"sometimes i need to design templates to hold coins. i got tired of using my old, partly rusted caliper from Sears. i've only had a chance to test it out with a few coins but so far it is accurate to within .02mm! i can't belive (at this time) it was only 11 bucks! a coworker saw it and instantly became jealous. i love that it comes in a well-built HARD plastic case with an extra battery. it even has a line-out slot for something. (no, i didn't read the instructions.) if you need to replace you old busted caliper, i would suggest doing it with this."
3,"Finding nemo ""window clings""","This was originally advertised as a coloring book with ""window clings"" I see that has since changed from when I pre-ordered it. The now ""bathtub stickers"" are a bit like small window clings but they have very faint colors and don't stick too well. I was disappointed at the time and am happy to see that they changed the description."
3,"sweeping it up, up, and away!","Rapid response, rapid delivery, of two identical brooms...one purchased as a gift. Love this type broom, and sought it out online. Works perfectly. Only problem is that when my daughters broom tipped over and hit the floor, the handle cracked off right at the base where it attaches to the head, and can't be repaired, and is now useless."
3,Not as pictured,"The brush part of the broom is as pictured. It sweeps really nicely, is light weight and all that. However, the handle is black plastic. Another reviewer said it was hollow aluminum. I expected a modern silver handle and just got cheap looking black plastic. Oh well. It wasn't that expensive I guess. It's odd that the handle is cheap plastic since the bottom brush part is crafted from nice wood and says 'made in USA' on it."
3,Don't assume it works for all laptops.,"Don't assume this works for all laptops. It didn't work for my ""Dell inspiron 6000"", and also for my ""IBM thinkpad T60p"", which I believe are widely used laptops.Check, if your laptop is really supported by this adapter, and don't assume it supports all, by looking at all different pins."
4,Works as advertised..,"Only thing I can say is that I used this for my laptop in the car while traveling and it keeps the laptop running and battery charged. Couple of things ""bothered me"" about this product...1. it gets pretty warm charging laptop battery 2. charge setting had to be set higher than battery rating for laptop to work with it."
2,Works fine but isn't packaged well for travel,"I mean, if the product is going to be used by someone travelling then provide a packaging case/bag/whatever to hold the components when it is not being used.Other than the convenience factor, they provide enough jack size to work with a wide variety of laptops and accessories."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"There is almost nothing new over 2002 and 2003, and there is nothing in the cd that you cannot get more cheaply on line. They have a connection with Writersmarket.com (a sloppily run outfit--don't give them a credit card). The book is better in the non on line version (That's a 4 star)."
3,Everybody ought to have one hard copy,"""The"" book for aspiring writers, everyone should have at least one copy. After that, the online service is maybe all you'll need. With a universe full of places to publish and agents to get you pubished and great articles by people like Jenna Glatzer, I've yet to see every page of my hard copy. I do, however, make constant use of the online service available with the purchase of the book. Online data mining makes for much quicker finding of what you need, as well as record-keeping of what you've sent where."
2,Just like the old one...almost,"This game is just like the old rampage. The only difference I found was that you couldn't continue like you could in the old version which was disappointing but I guess it makes it more of a challenge. If only the cities could look a little different than each other! It is a very simple, straight forward game. No real surprises."
2,I was disappointed with this book.,"My father died suddenly last October and I purchased this book to help me understand the grieving process. I found the humor irreverant and unsympathetic. I thought the book lacked guidance and had little more to say than the obvious, ""Guess what? Death happens."" I wouldn't recommend it to people looking for step-by-step information about grief."
3,Sometimes Chemistry,"What would you get if you put Egberto and Nana alone in a room together?On the first half of this CD, the two men work in rather tight structures, with largely brisk tempos. On these songs they get to flex their muscles, and their chops are impressive. However it feels like they're often stepping on each others toes. Or, maybe they're simply not giving the listener enough space in which to breath. Is this due to lack of rehearsal time?On the second half of the CD, however, things relax. There's a loose spontaneity, much playful interplay, and many moments of magic.The CD works best, I think, in the more relaxed and spacious sections. These sections are, in fact, very beautiful.I love these two artists, and I'm glad for this CD.For Egberto in a consistently rewarding duet setting, I suggest the wonderful CD ""Charlie Haden and Egberto Gismonti in Montreal."""
1,Sounds better than it is,This toy is really not worth the money. The magnets are not strong enough to propel/pull the cars. The only movement you can get is when you put the magnet so close to it that it simply picks up the car or boat. Doesn't work at all. VERY disappointing!!
2,Darcus @ Starcrossed,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is one of those classics that I have been wanting to read for quite sometime. Years ago, when the movie version, starring Johnny Depp, was released, I absolutely loved it and fell in love with the story and characters. Well, this is one of those cases of wrongfully watching the movie before reading the book. They were so utterly and completely different.In all honesty, I didn't really like the book. It's really short and there was really no mention of the horseman until about twenty -seven pages in (36 pgs total). It just wasn't for me.I'll stick to Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, thanks."
4,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"Washington Irving is a master storyteller who can conjure images with his skillful use of adjectives to describe everyday scenes. This story is not very long, so most should be able to read it in one or two sittings. Yet it has a simplistic charm to it that captivates the imagination.Ichabod Crane is really neither hero nor anti-hero. He is rather self-indulgent but otherwise not unlike many of us today. He is looking for love and looking for gratification. Aren't we all? He encounters rivals in his pursuit of love, one who apparently (it is never proven) who uses a local legend and the appropriate setting to scare old Ichabod into either death or flight (again, we are not quite sure).The story is really nothing more than a campfire ghost story set in post-Revolutionary War New York. It has a believable plot as far as ghost story premises go, and then builds the legend into the main story line. All in all it is a fun story to read."
5,I really loved this production,"I make no bones about it. I am an Legend of Sleepy Hollow fanatic. I have loved the story ever since growing up in that wonderful region along the Tappan Zee. Every Autumn, I look forward to reliving what WAshington Irving so lovingly captured. This production is simply a wonder to behold. It captures the flavor and feel of what Mr. Irving with our doubt meant to present. I was stunned to discover (to their credit) that this production remained very faithful to the book (something rarely done in this Hip Hop age). This is a great CD and I hope everyone gets a chance to enjoy the acting and very powerful music score. Get a copy, you will be glad you did."
3,so so .. at best.. and NO diaologue.. NONE,i was quite bummed when i opened this book only to find out that there is NO SPEECH BUBBLES. theres no diaologue or how ever you spell it. only the narrator describing what is happening. the art is nice and dark and is appropriate. it follows the original story as best as i know. but like i said the whole comic is voicec overed so to speak. hope this helps.
3,"Scary when you're 10. Now, not so much.","I loved this when I was younger, but as I reread it I couldn't seem to remember why."
2,Disappointing,"I wish this book had been previewable. If so, I would never have bought it. The book was a pain in the butt to read. First, it was written entirely in the passive voice (""The stories told by Brom Bones sank deep into the mind of Ichabod""). And second, there wasn't one word of dialogue in it. I am aware that the story is at least a hundred years old, but that doesn't stop me from feeling disappointed in this purchase."
3,Not to be Compared to the Movie!,A long time ago I fell in love with Tim Burton's dramatized version. This is nowhere CLOSE to being as good. The descriptive passages(about 90% of the story or so it feels like)become tedious and you tend to forget what's going on while you wait for the author to finnish describing a rock in the road or some such thing. Also very dissapointed that Ichabod and Katrina's relationship did not go as it did in the film and that it's unclear what Ichabod's fate really was by the end. I realize that it's the original and probably should be revered on some level but it was so dull and I can't bring myself to feel anything special for it. Glad it was free!
3,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"I thought that the story was very good. I read it because I liked the movie. As they say the book is always better than the movie. I enjoyed the part in the story that was about the bridge. I also think some parts of the book were better because you could use your mind to fill in the parts of the story that is not realy filled in. In the end the story is great, and it leaves you feeling safe in your bed at night."
5,A beautiful little book for someone who had not read anything by Irving.,I had not read anything by Washington Irving so now that I have my Kindle I decided to give it a go. To my surprise I found the story charming and the writing excellent. In some parts of the book I did see a few HTML errors that resulted in %@ etc but those were few and far between.If you have not read Irving before I highly recommend this book. The descriptive writing is just excellent and sure to hound you well after you have finished the book.
2,Disappointed,"In the movie, Crane ends up with Katrina. In Irving's book, Crane is never located...Oh, and the book lacked one important character...a HEADLESS HORSEMEN!"
3,headless horseman,Ichabod meets a lovely girl named Katrina but she used him to make Brom Bones mad and then Ichabod leaves in sorrow and then the Headless Horse Man throws a pumpkin at Ichabod's head and then Ichabod is never seen again.People who shouldn't read this are the people who can get scared very easily.
1,Mr. Rogers meets Saw 3,"I will keep this quick because it was already a waste of time to read this book. They used these horrible drawing for the book that look like my little brother did them. Basically they messed up the story and made it for kids. They made it a childrens book, if that is what your looking for then it is good."
3,the legnd of sleppy hollow,I read The Legnd of Slepy Hollow.I felt that this book was ok it had some excitting parts and other parts nothing really happend.This book was better near the end and beggining.This book would be a good one to read if you had to do a book report because it would be easy.
3,Gosh Darn Good Read,This book was ok but i wont recommend it to anyone because it could of been better. The plot was a little boring and it took me a little while to get into the book.
4,"Great, quick little read","As one of Kindle's free selections, if you're a fan of classic horror literature, you need this on your device. Read in one sitting, I loved the charm, silliness and terror of this classic little tale. Had seen numerous adaptations on stage and screen, but never actually read the original. Take a couple hours and do so."
4,I REMEMBER SLEEPY HOLLOW,"I LIKED THIS BOOK WHEN I READ IT BACK IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL. THE DESCRIPTIONS WERE REALLY DETAILED AND INTELLIGENT. THE HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF IT ARE METICULOUS AND THERE IS A LESSON TO BE LEARNED FROM THE PLOT AND CHARACTERS. THEY DON'T MAKE CHILDREN'S BOOKS LIKE THEY USED TO, THIS WAS NOT TOO MATURE FOR A CHILD TO READ IN THE FIFTH GRADE AND I THINK IT MAKES CHILDREN INTO VERY INTELLIGENT READERS."
5,Great folk tale classic!!!,"Washington Irving had a way with words that none could compare with. His simple and not very scarry at all tale of one of the most famous ""ghosts"" in history is both delightful in it's humor and wit and charming in it's character description. If you are looking for something to send shivers up your spine and make you quake in fear, you have looked to the wrong story master. Irving was a story teller of everyday people in everyday situations. The comical and the endearing. He made his observations on life and living it and left the afterlife to speculation. That is why ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is a true literary classic!"
3,Not what you'd expect...,"I read ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" to test out my new Kindle. It is extremely short and has a plot that has been adapted so many times that I really wasn't expecting what I got out of the real thing. Irving's writing was witty and beautifully descriptive. Its vocabulary was also often surprisingly advanced for such a short book. However, if a person goes into this book looking for a spooky tale of terror, this is not the place to look. Most of the actual book is build-up and description. Rather than being the scary story that people come to expect due to the many film adaptations, it seems to be more of an example showing how people can get carried away with superstitions as well as what deeds people can perform when consumed by jealousy. Irving's hints that Brom's jealousy prompted him to perform the elaborate hoax in which Ichabod's fears of The Headless Horseman are realized seemed pretty obvious to me."
1,Misleading,"These books are all ABRIDGED although it doesn't disclose that anywhere that's prominent. Don't accidentally buy any of this series thinking these are the UNabridged classics. What a rip-off. Amazon should really post the ""adapted by"" author!!!!!"
3,Satisfied despite struggling to finish it,"Maybe you need to be in a certain head space to get through this ebook. I found some of the story dragged on (descriptions seem to take precedence over movement of the plot in some parts I found). I don't regret reading it, however I would not class it as a book I would highly recommend to others either. For me, I found this passable. Would I read it again? Probably not."
3,Not what I expected.,"In rural America of the early nineteenth Century, by the Hudson River, lies the small village of Sleepy Hollow. The only recently arrived scholl teacher, the tall and lean Ichabod Crane, likes to spend his evenings by the fire with the old Dutch wives, listening to local horror stories of ghouls and goblins and haunted houses, among which that of the headless horseman, until one night after leaving the ball, he is chased by the legendary Galloping Hessian.I read this story because I love the film, and was surprised to see how few pages, less than ten out of fifty, were actually devoted to the mystery of the headless horseman itself. Although very well written, with descriptions that are stunningly real, the book left me hungry for more."
5,The One True American Fairy Tale,"Washington Irving's timeless tale of the timid school teacher Ichabod Crane and his fateful encounter with a backwoods ghost (The Headless Horseman!) is so indelibly imprinted on the psyches of the American citizenry that one can't help believe this is an eyewitness account by Mr. Irving himself! Spooky, and full of atmosphere and as much a part of the American experience as Apple Pie, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow is a true American classic that should be required reading in early highschool. A must read for Halloween time or if you ever plan a trip to upstate New York! So if you ever walk the backroads at night and you hear something unknown approaching, just take a guess as to what it is. It might just be the Headless Horseman!"
5,i love it i would read it again,it is so cool i would let my parents do anything to me to get me that book. i would recommend it to everyone in the world. i love the book -i don't care if people think im crazy over it. it is so cool & i have seen both of the moives.
2,"Legend of Sleepy Hollow, free Kindle edition","I didn't even get past the epigraph of this book. I'm going to delete it on my Kindle as soon as I get the chance. The reason is, there are numbers and symbols at the beginning and end of each line of the epigraph. I compared this version with the physical book just to be sure, and there are no such gooblygook in the book version. I'm going to look for a better Kindle version."
3,Kind of a let down...,"All these years I was brought up thinking that this novel was something special, even epic. Having now read it I was kind of let down. The writting was alright, but what I found so suprising was it's rather short length. I guess my expectations was of a massive novel, instead I get a short story that has less words in it than some cell phone owners manuals."
2,what,I don't even remember getting this. Probably a free book for mobile app. Oh well great book nonetheless. Recommended read
4,amazing... very educational.,this book tells the history of the sleepy hollow and it was even more amazing because when i was done my dad told me stories about the sleepy hollow we he lived there.
3,THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN RIDES AGAIN IN A NEW AUDIO ADAPTATION!,"This entry in the DH Audio ""Generations Radio Theater presents Tales By American Masters"" radio series is a good version with fine narration by Winifred Philips and a good musical score to accent the story. The only thing I have to complain about is that this is NOT an ""Unabridged"" reading of the Washington Irving story as advertised on the cassette case; this adaptation has been severely abridged, losing some of the more important elements of the story (such as Ichabod's life as schoolteacher, Brom Bones' history and rivalry with Ichabod, and the events after the night of Ichabod's terror-filled ride). Still, even with the cuts in the text, this tape is worth listening to in the darkness of your room to feel the chills run up your spine!"
3,A Good Escape From Reality,"Washington Irving creates a whimsical, dreamy setting in ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" that sends a reader into the same reverie in which his characters live. With rich and romantic language, a story of love, mystery, wonder is painted in the mind of the reader. The story is unpredictable and imaginative with a pleasant plot and a shocking ending. Irving adds many historical references to his legend which creates a heightened interest for the reader. Ichabod Crane is a creatively crafted main character. He is the one character that is made very familiar throughout the story. If the story has a flaw, it is the lack of dialouge amongst the characters(most likely because it is told as a legend by a narrator) that prevents the reader from feeling as though he is a part of the story's happenings and rather that he is looking upon them from above."
4,Good quick classic read,"This was a great short story to read. The text is from 1820 and with that the writing style and vocabulary is different than that of today and takes some getting used to. However, if anyone remembers the 1949 Disney adaptation of this story, the film is very true to the book. In the Kindle version, a quote at the beginning of the book was indecipherable as well as some proper nouns around 70%-80% of the way through the book. Other than that, I loved it."
3,Modern media has altered the story so much,"I had never read the actual story, but had seen so many TV shows or movies that are based on some of the story that I guess I was expecting almost a horror tail. The story was probably scary in the day, but has been trivialized by modern media to the point that it seems like a bed time story for toddlers. None the less, fun to have finally read the actual story."
4,"Good, especially if read before a visit there!","Wonderful writing, influenced by Washington Irving's many years living in Europe.It was an enchanting read, and that same week visited the Old Dutch church, Sleepy Hollow Cemetary, Iriving's Grave and his home Sunnyside in Tarrytown NY. Nice little fall thing to do."
4,A CLASSIC,"CLASSIC book that is a must-have for any serious reader. It is completely absorbing and the description of Sleepy Hollow transports you back in time and to the lazy little hollow. If you're heart doesn't race when Ichabod is being chased by the horseman, you might have to have your imagination checked by a physician.And for the reviewer who called Tarrytown ""unbelievably fake""--I hate to tell you--it IS a VERY REAL town. It existed then and it STILL exists today."
3,"Nice, short read","I almost gave this four stars, as it nearly deserves it. I am sure many will enjoy this, but I found I was bored at times. The fact that it is free is great and this is definitely a classic, though it has not really aged well. I don't regret reading this and I enjoyed the time I spent reading it, well most of the time, I just didn't enjoy it enough to say I really liked it. Though I can see why others did. If you think you'll like it, read it if you own a Kindle. It's free."
4,Great Read,"Great book to read, Washington Irving is a great writer, I would suggest this to anyone who likes to read."
4,A classic,There is something to be said for the originals. I have the movie version by Tim Burton but had never read the original tale by Washington Irving so I thought it would be fun to see how close to the original it was. The names are the same but there is definitely some poetic license taken in writing the movie. The book leaves more for the imagination and allows you to make up your mind whether there was something supernatural at work.
4,Good short read,"I thought this book was pretty good. It is a quick read and different from the movie. I would recommend this, you can say you have read the actual story."
5,"Awesome series, awesome season","One of the best tv comedy series of the last decade. If you're a comedy fan, How I Met Your Mother is ""LEGENDARY"""
5,Fantastic,Another great year of how i met your mother. Each season is better the the prior. I would recommend this for your video library!
5,HIMYM 7,I love this series. It arrived at my doorstep way earlier than I anticipated. The product was well priced I even got $10 back for the price adjustment.
5,DON'T END!!,This was a solid season for a great show. The new characters were a great addition to the cast. I am excited to finally catch up on Season 8 now!
3,Huge Step Down,"Wow how have the mighty fallen, this season is a massive step down from previous seasons. Season 6 was not upto par with the previous seasons but still reasonable however season 7 is a new low and at this rate they are gonna get cancelled.This season truely makes Ted look like a complete loser as he is desperately chasing girls he's already been with and the show's producers run through the ted and robin & barney and robin thing yet again, a sure sign the original ideas are definately drying up."
3,Christmas present,This is a Christmas present so I'm not sure of the quality yet. It looks like it is in good shape.
5,Amazing!,"This is Such a good show, makes me laugh every time! I always enjoy watching episodes, even ones I've already seen. They never seem to get old and I love that about HIMYM."
5,Great series,A must have for all the 'Barnyisms'. there are some episodes that you just have to watch over and over again. The packaging is good. No scratched or broken discs.
4,Great Show but....,Love the show its very funny great story. The really only character I don't like is Ted (the main character). The truth is though the show has passed its prime and needs to be rapped up.
4,first time buying a digital product,"I bought the ""how I met your mother season seven"" to watch online. It was the first time I have everbought some thing to watch on my computer and I am glad I did. One of the best features was that itmarked which episodes I had already watched in case I forgot. Since I watched this season over a period of a monthit was easy to forget where I had left off.I would definitely buy some thing like this again."
3,I think its time to start thinking on ending the series.,"I dont know didn't like this season all that much. They seem to be a lot of filler episodes where the comedy is OK i guess. Somehow I have the feeling they been overstretching this series a little bit, I have been watching season 8 and have the exact same feeling if not worse."
5,Excellent,"Arrived on time, some of the brackets holding the disc in place were broken, but the discs themselves are fine. Overall, no complaints."
1,Please send me the product,"Many weeks ago I bought this product and it is not shiped yet, when you will send it to me?"
3,Episode is fine but Amazon playback quality was problematic,"Love HIMYM and this episode was great but this Amazon video on demand playback starts several seconds into the episode, and there's no way to rewind back to the beginning! Amazon needs to work on their video quality."
5,How I met your Mother Season 7,"It was nice to be able to purchase and see it the same day, but I really would like to have the DVD's. Watching them instantly was good, but I don't have anything to go back and watch again, if I wanted to,other than that it was ok."
5,GREAT!!!!!,I absoutley loved this season. I bought it on my computer and can watch it whenever i have internet! Its much cheaper than buying the season dvd's and its much more convient too:)
5,funny series,This is a great continuance of the HIMYM series. I would suggest this to anyone who likes HIMYM or a show like Friends.
5,Funny as always!,If you love how I met your mother this season will thrill you! It kept me laughing and on my toes!
5,It's Legen wait for it...,you know it...DARY! It's awesome just like the other 6 seasons. Get them all. Watch them often. You will live longer for it. :D
5,time stops,"barney experiences that feeling of falling in love, being sure, and then that single moment where all the surety stops time itslef, and that feeling of failure seems to last forever."
5,Love it,Love every episode of the first 6 seasons and 7th season was no let down! Kept me laughing and guessing with each new episode!! Great buy!
5,How I Meet Your Mother,Legen.... (wait for it) ....dary!!! I absolutly love this tv show can't wait to purchase season 8 when it finishes.
2,Robin needs to go,ok seriously robin sucks and ruins this show especially in this season. the last episode was great up until the last few seconds of it. err made me soo mad
2,No way to download on Android device,"The content is fine, but I purchased it expecting to be able to download it for offline viewing on my Android tablet (this is why I use the Amazon MP3 store - easy download and use anywhere). Amazon Videos do NOT have this capability as of now, no way to download for offline use unless you are a Windohs user.Sadly, I won't be able to use this service until this capability is added."
5,Great album brings back great memories,"A popular jazz album in 1962 was this session featuring Jimmy Smith, with ""Walk on the Wild Side"" being the great favorite of jazz aficionados and pop fans alike. The song peaked at #21, no small achievement for a jazz musician at that time. Smith's music for the movie is probably better remembered than the film itself, although the entire set is a real jam session. ""Ol' Man River"" and the title tune ""Bashin'"" are also excellent numbers. This jazz CD is a real nice trip down the music memory lane."
2,Older toddlers can take them off too easily,"Most younger children under age 3 _will_ be stopped by these covers, but only if they do not figure out how to remove them altogether; they are fairly easy to remove: our 23-month old has no problem taking them off the door. A better design would make them harder to remove. (Note that the back of the package cautions that the covers should not be used once the child figures out how to defeat them.)"
2,Door Knob Covers,They come off too easy! They work to keep the wallsfrom being hit but if you pull them they will comeoff.
2,Oil and Vinegar Combo,I ordered this product because it was cute and I needed a new oil and vinegar dispenser. It's much smaller than it looks in the picture. The vinegar is supposed to go in the middle but in reality I use more vinegar than oil when I am dressing a salad so this portioning did not work for me.The vinegar kept needing to be refilled. It is hard to get clean. I first put it in the dishwasher but it came out with oil residue on the inside. Then I soaked it in soapy water but still there was oil residue on the inside. I would not recommend this product. I will be buying separate oil and vinegar bottles in the future.
4,"Very cute, too bad there is a bad guy!","My daughters 8 and 4 love horses. So naturaly they love this DVD, however they hate the ""bad guy"" in it. All the Strawberry Shortcake DVDs we own are very happy so I thought this one would be like the others. They love the 1st episode on this DVD, but not so much the 2nd. Too bad the 2nd one has to be about a greedy guy who kidnaps Strawberry's horse!"
1,Strawberry Shortcake - Adventures on Ice Cream Island,"As my almost 4-year-old daughter is a big Strawberry Shortcake fan, we snapped up this title as soon as it was released and were very unhappily surprised to find the story included a villain and a storyline my daughter found to be disturbing and scary. She was horrified to see Honey Pie and the other ponies locked up in a cage, despite the ponies ultimate escape. Needless to say, my daughter took an active dislike to this video and insisted that the DVD be banished from our home. Moms beware. This release does not hold true to the sweet stories typical in the first three Strawberry Shortcake VHS/DVD titles. I don't know what DiC Enterprises was thinking when they tinkered with the format. If future releases continue in this fashion, we will not be buying."
1,Dissapointed Child Of the 80's,"Strawberry Shortcake was my Favorite thing when I was little. So, naturally, I started looking for some of the old movies for my little girl. I really don't like the new look of Strawberry Shortcake and her friends, but bought this DVD for my daughter anyway. I love the smell of the DVD case, it smells just like my SSC doll that blows kisses that I got when I was 5. But the stories are really stupid, and the songs are painfully done. I don't know why they had to dumb it down so much. I personally miss the cuteness of the classic, as well as Sour Grapes and the Purple Pie Man. The villain in this is just rediculous. My daughter does like the first story, but won't watch the second one,(She's 3) the bad guy really bugs her. So, I am back to searching for the classics. I wish they would just put the old ones on DVD."
3,"Cute, but not our favorite Strawberry Shortcake movie","My daughter is almost 3 and loves Strawberry Shortcake. I thought she would really like this because it has horses too, but it has turned out to not be our favorite. The movie is very cute but just not a hit at our house."
1,Never got mine - been over a year!,"I ordered driectly from Greg's website but my item never arrived. When I questioned the delay he responded that the item had to be manufactured and shipped from Hong Kong. A month later, I emailed again - no response. Two months later I emailed again - no response. I know others that have ordered and they are happy enough with the end product. I just wish I would have received mine OR been refunded my money."
1,Be carefull!,This guy is a faker! I ordered in august 2010 - my items didn't arrive untill today. My last emails had not been responded as well.
1,SELLING ITEMS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE AND CANT GET,"I WILL SAY THAT GRECCO GEAR DID EMAIL ME BACK BOTH TIMES THAT I TRIED TO CONTACT THEM ABOUT THE ITEM I BOUGHT AND HAD NOT RECIEVED OVER A MONTH. BUT BEWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE BUYING FROM THEM, THEY ARE SELLING ITEMS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE AND LOOKS LIKE THEY CAN NOT GET. I WAITED 4 WEEKS AND STILL DID NOT RECIEVE THE ITEM--I WILL GIVE THEM THIER PROPS, THE LAST TIME I CONTACTED THEM ABOUT THE ITEM, THEY EMAILED ME BACK TO LET ME KNOW THAT THEY HAVE REFUNDED MY MONEY TO MY CREDIT CARD. THANKS GRECCO GEAR FOR THAT. BUT NOW I HAVE WAITED SO LONG I DONT KNOW IF I WILL BE ABLE TO BUY ANOTHER SINGLET BEFORE NATIONALS. BEWARE!!!!"
2,not enough colors,"The scarves were good quality but I should have paid more attention to previous reviewers on this gift.the pack had about 5 or 6 black scarves and a couple other colors, nothing like the picture. save your dough on these scarves."
3,really cheap,"i really like it except that i only got 4 colors. i got 6 blacks, 2 reds, 1 pink and 1 white. i know they said we're going to get repeats, but i didn't expect 6 times! anyways, it's really soft and very warm. i really wish they'll do better in color selection. shipping is fast though a bit expensive. the pashmina is a good value for the money though."
1,"6 blacks, 4 reds","Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received. Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink. I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got. Useless.I'm upset beyond words. Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this."
5,Perfect Gifts for Co-Workers,"I work in a nursing facility. I needed low-cost Christmas gifts for my co-workers. I was afraid of the quality of this product, given the price. I ordered two sets and received 5 blacks per set. Each set had identical colors. The quality was wonderful. And, most people preferred black for its versatility! Everyone LOVED them!!! I would definitely order again. Thank you."
3,Mind-Numbing Boredome,"This game wears off very quickly. After you have seen the limited repertoire of fancy moves, there is little left to show. The game action is slow and methodical. Graphics are about average. The music is okay, but nothing special. I give it a 3 because it can be used to kill lots of time."
3,"Everything great, but the gameplay","This game is neat if you are used to games like NBA Shootout, but if you have played games like Live and Inside Drive you won't like this game. Every thing is really neat except the gameplay. You get to pick bling, tattoos, clothes, shoes, and even hairstyles, but how are you supposed to win when the defense makes every shot they take..."
3,street hoops,this would be a great game but it has some flaws. One is that the trash talk is so repetetive that the fans will say the same phrase twice in the game. Also it takes a long time to load. Lastly all of the uniforms look the same. You dont know who is on your team. The only good thing is that there is a bookie and you can place bets on each game.
3,It's cool but kinda dissapointing,"OK this game is tight if u are a fan of the and1 mixtapes and u know what they're all about. If u want nba players, they are not meant for a street game, they are meant for an NBA game. This game has got all the ballers from the and1 mixtapes such as hot sauce, AO, 1/2 man, ect. But no skip to my lou! i was dissapointed when i got this becuz u have to earn the and1 guys, and u have to win a lot to get um. Also, u cant do a lot of and1's best moves such as puting the ball through a defender's legs, puting it around they're head, and a lot of the nastiest and craziest street moves that they invented! They gotta make a street hoops 2 which has got updated moves that will make u jump out of ur seat when u see um!! rent this, dont buy."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it","I was going to buy this game but instead I rented it to try it out first. Good thing I did. I played the demo and I thought it was cool. Something different in the sports world. But for the most of this game it is all dunks. The dunks are cool and all, but it seems like thats all it is. I would say rent the game (or buy if you really want to) and play the game with your friends. I got sick of the game after a few hours. The game mode is limited to just playing 'games'. No specials like practice mode, making plays, or duck contests (oddly enough is what this game is mostly about 'The dunks'). Anyhow, I think its a cool idea in the basketball gaming, but a bit to go to get 5 stars."
3,good bad,great details and sorry graphics ok kind of style.Like the options you have before the game. Like the footaction thing the pawn shop and the hair salon and the placeing bets.
1,bad,i dont like to read books but i will read a book that gets my attention and when i started reading this book i hated it this book was very boring and uninteresting and just dull nothing interesting happened. the main girls sister had diabetes then shes hospitalized because she doesnt want to do what she has to then they get a new house guest who tells the girl about the pirate queen and the dad isnt around much in the book but thats not really anything interesting because the way it was written it just didnt get my attention at all.written by courtnee E.
3,"SEX,DRUGS,AND ROCK'N'ROLL!!!","If you like girls in leather,guitar solos,and gratuitous death scenes than this is the movie for you.It's straight out of the eighties and the thing that surpised me the most was that Traci Lords accualy kept her clothes on!Don't worry though it has lots of groupie scences were they just can't seem to keep their clothes on.The main charector has to eat people to stay alive so it's a cannibalistic gorefest threw most of the movie.I would recommened this film to anyone with a good sense of humor and everyone who has ever dreamed of what it would be like to be a rock star!"
5,Just see it,This is by far the WORST movie ever made. So bad no description could possibly do it any justice.
4,Lucky find,"""Restoring"" my 1995 F350 for camper use and needed new ground loom. Obselete from Ford dealer but just happened to find here with search for ""battery ground wire"" or similar. Came promptly, reasonable price and perfect. Fits other listed applications as well."
2,Hip Santa,"This was not what I expected. To modern for me. I had wanted the words to ""MustBe Santa"" song. Received them by other means."
3,It's Okay -- but not great.,I bought the CD because of the Must Be Santa song -- which is great!! There were only a few other songs that I liked. Most of the other songs just got on my nerves.
3,3an a half stars ...,well after being slightly dizzy from something in the movie --i realizethat arnold MUST BE BRAVE... an sad for his little xmas tree daughter ...HE MUST BE ...i kinda agree with the review by liberal from florida 12/3/07 5an a half stars for the song an movie witch is an ice breaker for more stuff in the future ...posterity ...superiotious an MUST BE SANTA is a good song ....by shdfh ...
1,Worse than video!,"Where do I begin. Let's start with the sound quality. If your listening through headphones, don't bother using the left earcup, there's nothing there. The right cup is filled with overpowering analog hiss. I could barely hear the dialog. It's not letterboxed or widescreened, it's full screened, or rather left hand justified. If there is any action where the camera has to move quickly to follow it (and there is), the pixils rudely take over. What a mess. If you're a hardcore Caan fan, perhaps you'll suffer through this. The majority of the movie is narrated by some 35 year old woman attempting an 89 yr. old voice. How does it end? I don't know. At around 23 minutes, my DVD crapped out and my player was audibly struggling to find a track. The only difference between this DVD and my DVD of ""Boy in the plastic bubble"" is ""Bubble"" at least played till the end. I just started a new catagory on my DVD shelf. The trash can right next to it."
1,Total Waste,This is one of the greatest wastes of talent I've seen in some time - and I've seen some stinkers. Why Caan and Powers accepted this script is beyond me but at least they survived its embarrassment and went on to much greater things. I can forgive a lot in a Western and can avoid the others but this one should just quietly be forgotten.
5,"Sorry, It's not the Seller fault!","i can't review this, here is the reason.The DVD I recieved Was Badly published.It was not the Sellers fault, it was just a bad print from the Studio.I did not return it. Because of the shipping cost. I do have it on VHS.I just wanted to replace it with a DVD.This is a good and fun movie about two old people's early years.When they were outlaws in the old westThat's why I gave it 5 stars.To the Seller,Great Service Great Products"
5,Amazing book,The Enneagram is a beautiful book that explores the depths of our original sin and Jesus' redemptive work in that.
5,very pretty pendant,"This is a beautiful, feminine pendant. I often wear it on a silver chain. For a more sexy evening look I wear the pendant on a velvet and lace chocker. I receive many compliments on it. I'd like to buy others in different colors if they are available."
2,Fine Historical Collection - Sound Quality Wretched,"If you're a historical of doo-wop and early R&B, there are definitely some forgotten tracks but most casual listeners or even for most - the sound quality is just poor. It's not the fault of the CD distributor, I'm sure they found what they could to work with. Music is worthy of a listen but unfortunately the CD sound quality is poor."
4,Nice Set,I've Followed Roy Hargrove for a Few Years Now I Reallt Dig His Tone&Sound.He is a Very Underrated Artist.He really strives at taking chances.this is a Nice Set.
3,"This ""Young Lion's"" best work.","While it is difficult for post modern Jazz musicians to truly match up to the greats of years past, Roy Hargrove dislays some impressive playing for a youngster. Having incredible chops and sensitivity for playing ballads, he is by far the more versatile player among his peers. However, as Wynton Marsalis gets most of the press for trumpeters, Roy is undeniably a gifted musician, while Wynton suffers from cliched blowing and criticism of ripping off Duke Ellington. Roy's strength has always been playing standards. As a composer, his compositions pales in comparison to his fiery soloing. Since Tenors Of Our Time consists of mostly standards, his playing truly shines. Especially since some of the best tenor saxophone players appear on this album, it is a chance for the uninitiated to hear some good music, and to in fact be introduced some of the best musicians most young Americans may never heard of."
4,We need a hero,"You want to cheer for protagist Dan Lenson, but the author has made his flaws so overwhelming you keep thinking, ""this guy is a schmuck!"" On the other hand, Commander Dan, toiling in a Navy so flawed you wonder how they can float a conoe, always comes through in the crisis. The writing is compelling, however dark, and I continue to read every novel in the series."
3,Will Dan Lenson go ashore?,"Back to Captain Dan Lenson and the destroyers - terrorist plots in the Middle East - good stuff, as always. But...couple of thoughts: Dan is in command of a rather old Spruance class ship: could it be that these are the ones Poyer knows in detail, and since he left the Navy he has no way to keep up with the newer classes? He won't be able to keep the Spruance thing going for long,they're starting to be scrapped! [EDIT 4/21/2008- Thanks to an alert commenter who points out that Poyer does in fact know the newer Perry class.]It's a good story, except right at the end, I felt he underplayed the effect of the nuclear blast - could the ship really have survived at all? And what about the heavy doses of radiation, his and others? And what was going to happen to the fallout plume? that stuff drifts....I think he set Dan up for a desk job - or maybe no more jobs! Dan's marriage is going away if he stays at sea, that's for sure."
2,Poyner is tired of Commander Dan,"Like others, I've followed the exploits of Dan Lenson, also I share the feeling that character development around him is poor. Although we read to escape into another's fantasy, in this novel the inner workings on this outing are slim. Cdr. Lenson barely explores his inner self, although we're given hints that he may freeze with a panic reaction at the wrong time - then that line gets dropped. The ending is almost like ""I've written my contract length, cut it off somehow."" To save the ending, at the very least I think Cobie should get the Navy Cross. I come from a long Navy family tradition, even though I became a career Marine; I know how Cobie could do it."
3,Not as Advertised,I bought this for my wife's birthday. She is a huge AMC fan. The price tag was hefty ($120.00 with shipping) but the book was not. It was filled with interesting tidbits about the show but it was advertised as 240 pages in length but turned out to be only 220 and that was including the index and cover pages. That's not an insignificant error.
3,Not a complete waste of time...,"I watched this on cable tv the other night [for want of something better], and actually found it watchable, mildly entertaining even. The plot isn't exactly new...it centers around three people, a wealthy couple, Jack and Jennifer [played by Billy Zane & the sexy Kelly Brook]who together with their boatman Manuel [Juan Pablo di Pace] find themselves marooned on a remote island after a boating accident. The dialogue seems contrived throughout the movie, but what actually keeps this afloat is the above average acting by Billy Zane, as the insanely jealous husband, and the sexy performance by Kelly Brook. The conflict between the two men over Jennifer is palpable, and there is great chemistry between Jennifer and Manuel. It isn't a great movie, not even good, but watchable."
4,KELLY BROOK,"This movie was what I expected.Lets face it,seeing Kelly Brook naked and in various stages of undress was worth it.Story was ok but I will let you watch the surprise ending."
2,LET'S GET ZANEY,"This purportedly steamy erotic thriller basically has little eroticism and no thrills. Billy Zane and Kelly Brook play a wealthy couple who are cast asea when their rented yacht catches fire, due to the temper of the hunky shipmate, Juan Pablo di Pace. First Kelly arrives on a deserted island, followed by DiPace. They initially spar and flirt, and then build a little hut and all is well until hubby Zane washes up too. The romantic triangle is pretty predictable and Zane's performance is typically lifeless and wooden; Brook and DiPace look good but the storyline is spread out to meet the ninety minute timeframe without any real novelties, only a small surprise twist ending. And what in the world does the voodoo shmoodoo have to do with anything? The ocean looks beautiful, too, but the movie's not that noteworthy."
1,BLAH,VERY SLOW AND BORING. NOT A FAMILY MOVIE AT ALL. BEFORE SPENDING MONEY TO RENT IT SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH IT ON TV.
2,It's the size that matters,The dude that plays Manuel in this mess is the same one that sued the Royal Opera House in London for using a photo of him nude in a production of Rigoletto. He claims that the photographer airbrushed his wanger to make it appear too small. I saw the production when I was in London. He was neither big nor small---just ordinary. Me thinks it is the ego that is big.
1,Survive This Movie,"A waste of talent of Titanic proportion for Billy Zane, if you'll pardon the pun. A Robinson Crusoe shipwreck it is not. Can a cigarette lighter's fluid really last a year when it is the only source of fire to cook with? A well endowed Kelly Brook shows a lot of skin and not much acting ability. Competing for Ms. Brook is the other hunk, Juan Pablo Di Pace. As the flimsy plot develops he is actually under the spell of a spurned lover who is into voodoo rituals. Got that? If you want to see an entertaining adventure film, check out ""The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak"" (also available from Amazon.com). It's got more action, more scenery, more almost naked women and men, and a plausible plot."
5,Toy Rocks!!!,"We brought this 3months back, still this is the favourite one among 100 other toys. Good Quality and Balancing toy."
5,Excellent toy but 1 bad safety issue with seat,"The rocking horse is a great toy for any child. But, buyer beware...do not lift the rocking horse by the seat. If you do, the screw that holds it into place will pull out and tear the plastic insert. Thereby making it a safety hazard because the screw will no longer stay in place. My child lifts the seat often and the screw falls out. I am concerned that he may put it in his mouth and choke or swallow it. It's very long."
1,Waste of Money,"My husband and I bought this toy for our son a year 1/2 ago. We were so excited about having a ""classic toy"" to have for many years and hope to pass along. Yeah right. This thing had parts that kept coming apart, ie.. the saddle the ears, the leg. It now sits in our basement waiting for the trash. I hate to throw it away because we payed so much for it but it just has not lived up to the ""Radio Flyer"" standard."
2,Dangerous probing ear,"My 20 month old daughter received this for Christmas. At first we thought it was the best gift ever but when she got on and started rocking we realized she could send the wooden ear through her chin, eye or mouth. We sent it back soon after. It's nice that Radio Flyer still makes the classic toys but I think it's a huge safety hazard."
2,Not meant for a one year old.,"We were looking for a friendly rocking horse our little one could grow with. This Classic Wood Rocking Horse age range was 12-24 months. We purchased for a year birthday. This horse is not for anyone younger than 2 years. The seat is very narrow and hard, the length from seat to base is measured for a giant. Our little one is in the 95th percentile in height and is months from reaching the base. I think there are better rocking horses out there. The only thing positive, it's attractive."
4,Dali-Lost in Space,"This should be reworked with a changed more powerful score. I wouldn't change any of the actors, although I did reach for my abseced tooth once and awhile. I must go back and see Death Race 2000 again. I asked my wife tonight I f I should become an actor, because it doesn't seem like I'm making it at anything else. Hope floats. I loved the coloring of the scientist! Stereotypes are shattered, an alcholic can properly raise two children on her own. Although, I wonder where the realist were: they didn't run out of gas once, even at 3 miles to the gallon, they were present when the desperate housewives were starving, I got really excited to see a realistic Zombie!! Sandra Kinder made it in the movie ""worth the price to see it again."""
1,A most dissapointing choice,"I found this movie had very little story line I could follow. I am trying desparately to remember what happened but my recall of this mivie is a better description. A movie length nothing! No politics, no made you think moments whether for or against your own thoughts.I was glad to buy it because now I can tell my friends what not to waste there money on!Sorry nothing positive to say about this film."
3,"Lasted one year, but company replaced it",We bought this can crusher December 2010 it broke by September 2012. It worked ok for that period but plastic is a horrible material for this use. It cracked which rendered the entire unit worthless. This was a complete waste of $30.I have contacted Easy Pull about the warranty and will update if and when a replacement arrives.Update: The replacement arrived yesterday and works great. I am increasing my rating to 3 stars due to the great customer service. I hope this one lasts longer than a year.
4,Easy Pull Can Crusher,"Very easy to install and is very easy to operate. So far, I am very pleased with it. I would have given it five stars but I have not had it long enough to see how long it will work trouble free."
5,Excellent Can Crusher,"This can crusher is one of the easiest to use. It is made of durable, yet lightweight materials. With the optional attachable collection bin, it is truly a one step process. You don't need the strength of a gorilla to crush a can. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top notch can crusher."
5,"Well made, well designed","After breaking yet another rivet on the best can crusher I could buy at the local store (the fourth one in five years, which defeats the entire recycling effort), I read the reviews on Amazon and bought this one, and I am delighted.It's easy to use (no need to dent the cans before crushing and it requires very little force), and it deposits the can directly into our recycle bin. I predict that this is the last can crusher I will ever need to buy."
5,Best crusher ever,"UPDATE: The plastic base cracked after two years of use. I emailed the company and within minutes received a reply to return the crusher and that they will send a replacement. Terrific support, they stand behind their product.Original post:This can crusher looks good and works great. The one hand operation, with the can dropping into a bucket, is terrific. The best part is that kids love it, I'll never have to crush a can myself again."
3,No Mess Can Crusher?,"It's only a ""no mess"" can crusher if you buy the available accessory that catches the cans. The crusher works well. My wife says it's really noisy."
3,Good 12oz crusher,Does a good job crushing 12oz cans but anything larger does not fit. Stable and durable but any Monster cans or Full throtle or anything larger than a 12oz can I still need to stomp.
3,works well,only thing wrong was I order a crusher that would fit 16 oz cans and I did not get that size. otherwise it works great
5,Great product!!!,"Love this product...so glad we spent a little extra to purchase...we crush a lot of cans and this is a little dynamo...I was concerned about it being harder plastic, but it's perfect!!!"
4,"It works as expected. These days, that is saying alot.",This is a good can crusher. It works fine. It works on the Coors Lt. cans that are taller than normal. Easy to install. I haven't had it long. I researched many before making a selection. Free shipping made it affordable.
5,Great!,"The length of the arm on this crusher gives you a LOT of leverage, making it very easy to crush cans. Auto ejection makes it really easy to develop a rhythm and crush cans very quickly.I put a plastic tub on the floor below and cans drop out automatically. A few (like 3 or 4 out of 100) cans will hang, but a quick tap and they'll come free.Construction feels very solid. Definitely recommended."
5,Easy Pull Can Crusher-Great Tool for Recycling,"I have used other can crushers in the past but found that the Easy Pull was a new product in the marketplace. It is easier to use than other crushers as it crushes the can without as much effort.We have younger children who visit our home, and they love to crush the cans. With the Easy Pull, they cannot get their fingers caught and it automatically dispenses the can so it is really safe for them to use.It is a great tool for recycling and because the Easy Pull crushes the cans to a fraction of their original size, it really saves the space in the bin. The collection bin co-ordinates well with the crusher and is space saving.I highly recommend this product to anyone who has the need for crushing cans. I find this product to be an excellent value."
5,GREAT,"Great can crusher. Very easy to do, as the add says even a kid could do it. You do not have to dent the sides in or anything. I have my recycling box right under it and it just dumps them right into the box. For those who don't know drill this into a stud in the wall. Does not fit tall boys but by the picture I already knew that. Very happy would definitely recommend."
5,can crusher,"we bought the crusher for the lake and put it on the covered deck. Easy to install and so easy to crush! Have only used one month, so far works great!"
5,Recycle Aluminum Cans,Works well. I would give this product 2 thumbs up. Drops cans automatically into my trash can after each crush. Fast work. Have used for aluminum cans only.
1,Junk!!,This thing is JUNK! After crushing only 4....yes 4 cans it snapped in two. Way over priced for the quality. It's nothing but plastic. I would recommend spending a lot less on a different product...which will probably quarantee at least more than 4 total cans crushed over the life of the product.
1,Disappointed!,"The metal rods have bent after using it on 14 cans rendering it unusable! In fact , it bent on a Smaller Tomato paste can. Can't say I would recommend this product based on my experience - also , takes some force to crush the cans to 3/4 of there size - does not flatten them completely. Thought I was doing the right thing!"
3,not for ALL cans,"Was disappointed, but that was my own faultDidn't ask the question - does it crush big beer cans?It only crushes small soft drink cans.We don't drink soft drinks in cans,so haven't used it once yet!"
5,"Outstanding product, durable and strong","Superb, crusher...read reviews and it matches them to a tee! Great buy highly suggested. Excellent design and simple to install...PERFECT"
4,Best can crusher ever seen,"I have owned several can crushers and the honeymoon was over quickly on each one. This can crusher would have gotten 5 stars if it crushed the can just 1/4 to 1/2"" more. My wife buys Red Bull by the case and this is the first can crusher I have ever seen or heard of that can crush them. Ordinary can crushers can not handle the tall and skinny Red Bull cans. My recycle bin sits right below and the Easy Pull drops the can in when complete. Gravity - not just a good idea, it's the law."
5,High Quality Can Crusher,Along with the available collection bin this is the best can crusher I have ever used. It keeps things easy and convenient where even my kids like to use it!
5,"The Easy Pull works much better than ""The Crusher"".","I bought this model and one of ""The Crusher"" models. I mounted this one in the garage because it is not made of steel and put ""The Crusher"", a steel model outside.(We have very cold winters, here and I worried that the Easy Pull may crack or break outside.) The Easy Pull works great and out performs The Crusher easily. I keep a five gallon bucket lined with a trash bag underneath it and I like how the can just drops right in the trash without having to even touch it again. For best results just slightly squeeze the can and leave a small impression in it before loading it into the Easy Pull, it crushes it without using as much pull down force. The Crusher, although being made from heavier material, is a disapponitment. It does not automatically discharge the can, and it constantly spits the can back out when you pull down to crush it. It is a pain and a hassel and I wish I would have just bought two Easy Pull models, instead of just the one!"
4,Works Great.,Have used the Easy Pull Crusher for about 2 weeks now. Works well. I have concerns about the composite material it's made of but it does seem to be sturdy. I've used the cheap stamped metal ones in the past and they don't hold up very long. I hope this is an example of you get what you pay for.
4,Works Great!,"I read a lot of reviews on this item and others before making my purchase. This can crusher had the best reviews and has lived up to the expectations I had. I was a little nervous that this can crusher was made of plastic (and metal), when I wanted an all metal can crusher originally, but the plastic is extremely thick and durable. I would compare it to almost a thick fiberglass-type plastic, if that helps to conjur an image.It mounted easily and crushes easily as well. Product loses one star though because it cannot crush a 16 oz. can, and I would like to see it crush the cans a little flatter than it does.Overall a great product!"
5,Great Can Crushing System,"We've owned the Easy Pull Can crusher for almost a year now. Its easy to use, compact and streamlines our aluminum recycling efforts so we can make some extra cash. In addition, the collection bin that works with our Easy Pull unit is great. It makes the entire process much more tidy. I recommended this product to friends. Thanks!"
5,Handy And Easy To Use Can Crusher,We bought one of these Easy Pull Auto Dispensing Can Crushers with the crushed can container several years ago for our cabin. It has worked very well and is enjoyed mostly by the kids. So we decided a few months ago to get another one for our home. It is made of a heavy use material which I believe could be of a plastic/spun glass mixture and has taken much abuse at the cabin. One of the features I do like is the rotating handle which lets you hold the handle grip in your hand through the entire motion without letting it turn in the palm of your hand. Also it is a one hand operation that does not require excessive force to crush the cans and the available crushed can container makes it easy to remove and to dump the crushed cans into a recycle bin. With our use we find that the collection bin holds about thirty five crushed cans. We our happy with both of our Easy Pull Auto Dispensing No Mess Can Crushers and would recommend them highly to anyone!
5,Awesome Crusher,"This crusher is outstanding. The material with which it is made is the same type of plastic from which my two wheel hand truck is made. It has been handling 400 pound loads for many years with no trouble. The neat thing about this crusher is that you can crush the cans one handed. It ejects the crushed can without your having to use your other hand. You can hold a few cans, or a case of empties in one hand and load and crush with the other. I highly recommend this product."
5,Solid solution at a great price,"This product is very well engineered and constructed. I can't see any way to improve on the design. The operation is very smooth, and there is ample leverage such that even my kids can do the job. In fact, they love to do it, so lazy dad can hand them the cans and they fight over who gets to crush!I have used other designs, this one wins, hands down. Be sure to get the matching bin that fits into the crusher, it's a neat and clean solution and worth the extra money; keeps the whole thing off the floor and conceals all the crushed cans:Easy Pull Collection Bin. When it fills up, just dump it into a larger recycling bin. You can buy the crusher and the collection bin together, which is what I did:EZ Pull Can Crush System with Storage Bin.I can't think of a reason not to get this system."
3,Not what you might expect,"Recorded near the end of his life, he sounds tired. The band -especially Gilmore-sounds good, but Sun Ra's playing is less than dazzling. Stick with the Evidence titles"
4,Project of LUCIFER 'S FRIEND of phantom,"Private solo album of vocalist JOHN LAWTON of URIAH HEEP.It should be called a work of the phantom of LUCIFER 'S FRIEND. It is likely to finish listening to any tune easily, and it be satisfactory.I wanted to listen to Since You 've Been Gone of the RAINBOW that JOHN LAWTON sang."
1,"""Big News"" = Big Disappointment","I was really looking forward to watching this 1929 early talkie starring a very young Carole Lombard. However, I could only get through the first thirty minutes of the film before I had to give up and stop the DVD. The movie itself was okay, but the transfer was terrible.The whole time that I watched the film, most of the actors' heads were cut off at the shoulders. This went on scene after scene. Talk about bad framing of the picture that appears on your TV screen. Come on, Alpha, you can do better than this.There are lots of B-movie and Poverty Row movie fans who depend on Alpha for its vast catalog of quirky, obscure, and mostly public domain titles in many different genres. Alpha does a great job with its colorful and well-designed DVD cases. So how about putting that same amount of time and effort into the picture and sound quality of the movie that's inside the case."
4,Good Old Film,"At a time when talking movies are in their infancy, it is fun to see how they staged things. The wealth of experience that did not exist then was supplemented by the wealth of innovation and innovators.I liked how they showed the elevator with only a sliding door and the sound of an elevator pulley to give the impression of elevator movement."
2,No Callerid,I bought a bunch of these phones because I was happy with the previous model but be warned that they do NOT support callerid. I just assumed they would because the previous model did. I can't believe they can make a phone with this large of a display and charge $100 for a phone that doesn't support callerid. I am very disappointed.
2,No caller ID,As the last review says - I too did not realize this model does not have caller ID. Sellers should state this specifically. Very disappointed as well. Wish I had seen the previous complaint before purchasing.
3,Some Recipes You'll Want to Try Right Away,"Others, are just your regular fare, Some pretty pics though. Gives you a good geographical representation of that area. Hopefully we will remember them when next we are there."
3,Could Be Better,"I needed this book for a college level class and I feel that as textbooks go there are definitely better and clearer ones out there. I felt like I had to struggle to understand a lot of the poetry and the stories. I had to keep a French/English dictionary fairly close by at all times. It could have been the class and the professor (both of which I didn't care much for either) but I really struggled in this French class to make sense of the lessons.Also, it's a fairly expensive book and you don't get too much out of it. The CD is great to listen along with to help with your speaking, but really it's just reading some of the poems in the book. If you're buying this on your own I'd suggest you keep looking for something that will help you individually. If you, like me, are using it for class buy it used or rent it. This isn't anything that I'm ever going to pick up again and thumb through. In fact, I believe I sold it back to the store."
2,Subpar,For a french textbook this one leaves much to be desired. Some practice questions and context on the pieces of work found within.
5,FLEA FREE KITTIES,"We have 5 cats that are ""in house"" pets but we have 8 dogs that go out so we needed to protect the cats as well as the dogs. This product is both effective and reasonably priced; a great bargain."
1,Didn't work,"It nearly killed my cat. My cat stopped playing around and looking for food or water right after I put this on her. Instead, she just lying on the ground all day. I felt like she lost all of her enery. I was scared and took it away in the late afternoon. I was going to take her to the ved if she was still likes that the next morning. But thanks God, my cat came back to normal after one night. I am not sure why my cat has a such strong reaction to this. Maybe different cat has different situation."
4,no fleas so far,"The collar was easy to put on both of my cats. So far, it seems to be doing the job. I had been using Advantage, but it was getting too costly, and the cats hated having the stuff put on."
1,Terrible,Two cats removed the collar immediately. The third collar remained intact but the powder came off immediately.
2,Nice light - made poorly,"This light is nice, but it is not made very well. The pole that it hangs from did not screw in straight. You don't realize this (it looked fine on the ground), until you get it hung. It was a slight angle, but any angle of a light hanging down is not pretty. No way to fix this as it appears the threading was off. When taking this down to return, it is next to impossible to unscrew the post to repackage without ruining the pole. Also, the plate that goes up by the ceiling is very hard to get on and this is what holds the light up. It screws in on two sides which doesn't give much room between the ceiling and where you need to hold the screw driver. Also, this is very heavy so you need someone capable of holding it up for a while while you line these up."
2,Good little booklet,"Small booklet which deals with the essentials of flower drying. Couple of small diagrams but no glossy pictures. Gives all the essentials in a practical manner, but a few more diagrams and details would have been helpful. Not bad for a basic beginner but I think a more extensive book would make them feel more comfortable."
5,"Book itself is priceless,but....","The copy we recieved had bad binding glue and all the pages are coming out/apart. What is inside is beautiful,a true look into the world that once was,before the white dogs came with their thick and empty heads."
5,A moving tribute and vignette testimony,"Expertly edited by Michael Oren Fitzgerald and enhanced with a Foreword by Thomas Yellowtail, Indian Spirit is a compendium that deftly combines powerful quotes with black-and-white photographs on every page to share with the reader the wisdom and faith of Native American leaders. The wisdom herein derives from leading figures drawn from many tribes, and the photographs offer unforgettable portraits of the people who spoke enduring words of reverence by which to live our lives. A moving tribute and vignette testimony, featuring an index by authors and an index of photographs for swift reference, Indian Spirit is a welcome and appreciated contribution to Native American Studies."
4,Space Invaders,Space Invaders rocks!!! The cool 3-D graphics are so cool! I have it for Game Boy Advance SP. I got all the way through the game and won!!! It is a great game to play!
5,A Wise Gift ! ( to yourself) *smiles*,"Simple, elegent wise. Each page has a quotation. Awesome, such awesome wisdom. Inspiring. Helps make understanding the world, all the more simple. Save yourself hours of time, buy this book and a similiar to book, Jani King's - The Gift. Then after contemplating you'll have more understanding then reading hundreds of 'new age books' These two books are the best anywhere."
4,A Slight Let-down From My Fave,"I absolutely love Holly Cole's music. But taken in comparison with many of her earlier recordings, I'm afraid this one falls a bit flat for me. Sound quality is a notch down from her high standard, and the song selections and arrangements are also not quite up to par. Still a good recording that I recommend to all her fans, if not to those who may not be familiar with her body of work. Waters Of March is a high point, though!"
2,"Holly, what happened?","I was anxious to hear the latest CD by Holly Cole because I own ""Don't Smoke In Bed"" and Temptation"" and they are 2 of my favorite CD's. Unfortunately, ""Holly Cole"", just does not appeal to me. What happened to her unique style and the Trios great musical arrangements? This latest CD reminds me of background music and the recording is not nearly as good as the previous CD's I mentioned above. I will continue to listen to ""Don't Smoke In Bed"" and ""Temptation"" on a regular basis but ""Holly Cole"" will probably spend most of it's time in my CD rack."
2,White line fever?,"White Line Fever. No, it's not that exciting. White line as in so middle of the road it should have a strip of white paint running down the album cover.The beautiful Ms Cole has a beautiful voice and she knows how to wield it.Listening to Holly Cole Holly Cole (featuring Holly Cole) felt like witnessing a magic trick in which the extraordinary was rendered ordinary.A great dish of ointment."
2,Not ready for prime time!,"I was looking for a viable alternative to MS products and, in the last month, I have installed 5 different xxxBSD and Linux OS's. This version failed to recognize my hardware. As well, the istallation was D&O (dense and opaque). For people want to investigate other OS's, IMHO, the BSD's are not ready for you. In contrast, some of the Linux OS's have worked hard and do provide a usable path to these new OS's."
4,A Forster Classic,"With news that the British Government is closing its High Commission in Florence, this work is even more topical. This is light and funny, but it is not Forster's best book. Despite some of its shortcomings, the setting is thrilling and many of the characters are highly entertaining."
5,Excellent,"This book reminded me a lot of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" with a number of key differences:1. This one was written 20 years earlier.2. There is no sex - just two kisses on the cheek.3. It's just so much better - the psychology of the characters is much more realistic, the conventions of society are satirized much more aptly. Furthermore, this book is very funny at the right places while still being morally serious. It is also kind to the characters (including the ""bad"" ones) showing them as people with failings and not as straw demons to be skewered in service of the author's philosophy.So, if you like serious but enjoyable literature, go and read it."
3,A Novel With a View,"Forster's novel takes aim at the British ideas of respectability and social class. Lucy wants to rebel against the many rules that govern her conduct, but she is torn. She loves her mother and brother, and wants the admiration of her social set, but she finds so many of these people tiresome and hypocritical. I was struck by how frequently the title phrase is mentioned. There are the obvious references to her room at the pension in Florence and to the view from the salon at her home in England. But Forster also explores the ""view"" of one's acquaintances vs the reality of their inner core. It's when this second way of looking at things (pun intended) comes into play that the novel really got interesting for me.I did find the middle section - from the time Lucy and Charlotte left for Rome to Lucy's epiphany regarding George and Cecil - somewhat slow going. In fact, I just about gave up on the book. But I'm glad I persevered; the last five chapters redeemed the work for me."
3,"Does not live up to it's ""classic"" status.","I guess I am not a fan of Forster. I didn't too much care for ""Where Angels Fear to Tread"" and this second try was no better. He shoots for social commentary and hits it, obliquely, but his characters are flat and so not elicit sympathy. Worse, his Italy, so much a part of the book, is generic and without character.It is not the sympathetic and even sappy story, or the stilted behavior of the English gentry I dislike. I am a fan of Austen and the Bronte's. I think that it is Forster's treatment of the material and characters."
4,Ever Fallen In Love With Someone...,"Interesting, very interesting. But not on first read. Yep, like everyone else here, I read this book as part of an English literature course. And, the first time I read it, I felt like setting fire to the damn thing. But, like the Velvet Underground, if you force yourself to take this in repeatedly, you eventually fall in love with it. The story itself is so basic, so obvious, a standardised Romeo and Juliet fantasy, but the language, social commentary, and at times plain flippantry of Forster's writing just infiltrate your mind like a brain tumour. Call Forster Coupland in a chastity belt. Touching, life-affirming, and, in a twist for books you study at school, some characters you care about. The sexually frustrated Mr Beebe, the hateworthy Cecil, and the greatly underrated Miss Bartlett. If you've ever been in love, and something's gone wrong, then this book was written for you."
3,"Predictable plot, but interesting heroine","Old-as-time plot line (young woman growing up and going against convention) is livened somewhat by Forster's interesting heroine, Lucy. I found the ending a bit dissatisfying, perhaps because we don't get to see the reactions of Lucy's loved ones to her final choice. Although I haven't seen the movie, it is extremely easy to visualize a Merchant-Ivory type production from reading the book."
3,Vague and hard to relate to,"The thing I liked about this book is that it gives you a glimpse of the way people thought/acted/lived/interacted at the time it was written ( I can't seem to find exactly what year? ).Mostly I didn't like it because things were alluded to rather than explained. I couldn't understand some of the characters actions and motives.I almost felt like parts were left out - and this could be possible from what I have heard about some of the Kindle book versions. A couple of times the book skips over large blocks of time and lands us at a later point without filling in any details (like was there a wedding or what?)I did make it through the whole thing but I don't think it enriched my life in any way,lol."
1,"Great Book, Rip-Off Sub-Quality Printing","This is one of the great English Novels. Unfortunately, this is a sub-quality printing by an anonymous publisher that somehow got through Amazon's quality control process. There are numerous typos on every single page, mostly bad paragraphing and the like, making it actually unreadable. Don't buy the version with the steeple on the cover and the big Helvetica typeface."
3,Review,"Loved the book, we read this book as background for the movie which our bookclub did a review on this fall."
3,An old love story about one's place in society,"This book is over 100 years old and as a result, it is not the most flowing book. It deals much with society and one's place in society, of a woman torn between two men, one from her class and another from a different class. It was a bit difficult to separate what part of the book was intentionally placing characters in their societal place and what part of the society issues were a result of the time the book was written. It does draw the reader in and has him/her rooting for certain characters. Also, if you're looking for a book that takes place in Italy, this is not the best one. Most of the book takes place in England."
4,A view of the book,"A Room With A View takes place in England and Italy. The scenery is beautiful and the characters are very well developed. The book shows a lot about people and how they interact with each other and their surroundings. The main plot is about a girl falling in love and not always understanding or knowing how to follow her heart, but the real importance lies within the characters and their surroundings. Mr. Emerson and his son George are amazing people with wonderful ideas of the world, but they are frond down upon because they are different from the norm. I found the book very enjoyable although the first part was quite slow. The middle and the end of the book went quickly and had me hooked."
4,For lovers and those of 'Romantic' Italian sensibility,"'Everyone' has seen the movie (possibly several times) and enjoyed the beauty of the Tuscan landscape. This is an extremely witty book that examines the social mores of the English villagers of their class and time. It's not actually a long way between this and Joanna Trollope. It's a type of literature the English have been doing superbly for, well, centuries. This is not a hard book to read. It has nicely observed things to say about class attitudes, but is not particularly profound or deep. Just enjoyable.Younger readers might find it hard, especially if they have not had experience of the type of social structures and attitudes depicted. It will help you to understand about other places and times. All that is important for helping to understand where we are now."
4,Substantial Fluff,"On the surface, this is a nice bit of romantic fluff. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, she's in denial, she gets engaged to the wrong guy, conflict ensues, they finally happily ever after. But there's actually a surprising amount of substance underneath all that. From the quietness of his little love story, Forster brings forth some profound thoughts about life and love. Very enjoyable."
4,Lucy Wants a View of Life,"A Room with a View is a spare and striking novel about a man and a woman and about class and societal expectations and pressures. Lucy and her cousin Charlotte are offered rooms with a view of Florence by a Mr. Emerson and his son, who are willing to exchange. The strict and pinched Miss Bartlett does not wish to have an obligation to the Emersons, who are deemed less than polite society will condone. Their rector, Mr. Beebe, tells them he believes the exchange is proper and the ladies get their view of Florence. It becomes clear that Lucy herself wants a view of LIFE and later confesses to her fiance, a priggy intellectual, that she imagines him always in a room with no windows, with no view. The novel's love story is compelling, but the secondary themes of class and society structures are equally strong, with the truly noble characters emerging in the end with great strength."
2,A little corny slice of Italy,"A Room with a View is the classic love story. The woman falls in love with one man then gets torn apart from him. Months later she meets a new guy and sadly accepts his proposal to marry him even though she has feelings for the other man but knows she will never see him again. Then to throw in the climax he comes back they fall in love again, she breaks off the engagement with the other man and they go off and live happily ever after. I think this story is a little too corny for me. You can tell what is going to happen in the novel before it ever does. There aren't very many surprises in the novel and I think that is where I lost interest in the book. It is full of love, adventure and drama. Overall it has a good plot line and if you love traveling and Italy you will love this novel."
3,Not what I was expecting.,The book was rather odd. I read it for class and didn't find it that interesting.
2,movie is better,this reads just like the movie. you really don't get anything more by reading it. boring!
2,This Book Wouldn't Be Published Today,"This is another one of those so called ""classics"" that continue to be overrated based on the fact that they are ""classics."" Not to be confused with more deserving titles that make one wonder how a body of work can sound so fresh and accomplished after 50, 100, 200 + years, this particular work should be put on the bookshelf along with Count of Monte Cristo, Tarzan, The Lost World, etc. that are written by famous and gifted writers but in their off days, or off years for that matter.This book is difficult to get into and that is the beginning and the end of it. This is literature not a scientific endevour.If the manuscript were submitted for publication today, it would either not see the light of day or first get edited into shape and out of recognition. Story is good. Storytelling needed much better effort."
3,"a beautifully written, not very intesting drone","I didn't like this book. Short, written as gorgeously as anything else Forster wrote, there just isn't anything worthwhile going on.A comedy only because you laugh at how annoying everyone is, the story verges on outrage because nobody seems to matter. Oh, sure, they care desperately about everyone and everything they're supposed to be involved with, but the characters are pompous, the resolutions are forced or indifferent, and I can't say I recall much of anything that actually happened shortly after completing the text.Another thing to draw it down is the fact that I tended to think of other things while still reading this book. Not while it was set aside, waiting to be vaguely experienced, but while it was in front of my eyes going on.In spite of all this, three stars is accurate because sometimes Forster comes up with an accute anatomization of why these people act this way. A stirring, psychological portrait of people I couldn't care less about."
3,You will wonder why it has been considered as great book.,"Maybe for its time, the novel was considered to contain ground breaking ideas, and a great drama. But you unless you are interest in social studies or the antrophological development of romance, you will find most of the situations downright silly. Maybe what particularly bothered me was that the writter did not make any significant effort to provide clues of why the characters fall in love. Actually, their attraction seems to be a mere infatution of inmature personalities, presented to the reader as a great romance."
1,Unreadable because of fixed line length,"Do not buy this version. It is not formatted correctly for the Kindle. It has fixed line lengths which wrap awkwardly on the Kindle, making it very difficult to read."
2,A touch of class,"E.M.Forster is a semi-classical English writer, who produced numerous novels set in the early 20th century. Later, film director James Ivory (an American, strange as it may seem) made a career for himself by turning these books into movies. ""A Room with a View"" is what you could have called ""Proletarian literature"" in Soviet literary canon; only working-class setting is replaced by the British ""proper"" society, still unscathed by the Great War. I have a thing for this epoch, but Forster's book does not reflect its charm in the least. All because of its social message. No gripping plot, no character development, no psychological motivations. The only really enthralling thing is to observe to what degree did the English train their language to conceal feelings. It is what makes the books like Forster's or Ishiguro's ""Remains of the Day"" almost untranslatable. In Forster's case, though, no harm done."
2,Over-rated Plot That Goes Nowhere,"I hate to be the one to write a bad review about this book, however I feel there is a lot of hype surrounding this classic that is not deserved. The plot is fairly simple, and very similar to that of Romeo and Juliet. The girl loves a rogue, but her parents want her to marry the spectacular man they like. Etc. Some scenes in this Edwardian book I agree or slightly amusing, but it is not worth the read."
2,ENTIRELY UNORIGINAL,"A Room With a View is hardly what you could consider fine, classic literature. The plot runs off of a much more dramatic and insightful classic, Flaubert's Madame Bovary. The stories are the same: a woman, dissatisfied with her station in life, seeks happiness in an unorthodox way (namely a man) that entirely displeases her relatives and friends. The only difference is that Flaubert gives his heroine a realistically tragic end, while Forster opts for the happy, fairytale finale.It is this unoriginality, lack of plot depth, and dialogue reminiscent of a Hans Christian Anderson story that makes A Room With a View dissatisfying. Forster obviously felt the need to contribute a story that, with its tiresome protagonists and only somewhat interesting antagonists, would teach future writers one thing: change a famous writer's denouement around and you can gain all the fame and merit you could want off one piece of literature.Holly Burke, PhD.Georgetown U."
2,What a Sappy Book!,"If you like Dirty Harry, Terminator or Rocky, don't read this book!!! This book will lull you to sleep. On the plus side, it is written extremely well, but that does not make it easy to read. Skip this one and go on to The Great Gatsby."
5,Captivatingly romantic!,"I have read this book over and over after first being inspired by the movie of the same title (do see it). It is a true book to curl up with and get completely entwined within its rapture! Beautifully romantic, humorous and moving in a perfectly described landscape that you can almost picture; between the very lines as you read."
4,A love and truth story,A classic harboring profound truths. Sometimes difficult to read the Victorian English. I read this for a book group discussion and am glad of it.
1,Outrageous price for a book that should be free,"I bought this book not realising it was a Project Gutenburg free book. Dont waste your money? And seriously, $20+ for an ebook is outrageous anyway! But like an idiot I didnt do my research. Dont make the same mistake I did!"
3,"Unbelievable characters, tedious plot","A young Victorian Englishwoman visits Italy, and the memories affect her life after she returns to England.I picked this book up free from Gutenberg. Slow-moving coming-of-age story with frankly unbelievable characters acting in unbelievable ways. All the posturing and actions that didn't fit the characters left me cold. I finished the book and I'm not sure why - maybe I thought something would have to happen soon. It didn't. However, the Gutenberg edition includes the passages missing from the Amazon Kindle edition; other than some minor typos, the formatting was fine."
4,a wonderfully beautiful and funny view,"Short and beautiful, a classic Forster. vivid, colorful prose and intriguing characters and the struggles between free mind and societal proprieties, passion and duties... A lovely read."
1,Far Side of Tedium,"Sleigh's poems are an odd brew of arid bookishness and meeching self-pity. All of these poems' effects, and I mean all of them, come across as studied and second-hand. Sleigh is weary of the world in a variety of distinctly superior and fashionable ways. Allusions to the classics abound, as they often do when a poet tries to prop up slight material with ""learning."" Dust collects in the corners of these poems. This book is a perfect example of poetry willed into existence by a writer devoid of talent."
1,"Blurry, Faded, and Flat","This print arrived today; as soon as I unrolled it I realized I had made a mistake with this purchase. The quality is worse than if I had printed it on ""fast draft"" on my inkjet printer. The colors are incredibly under saturated, the contrast is extremely low, and the details are blurry.The original work is dark, and bright, with every shade of red and gold and grey. This is predominantly beige and brownish-orange. I never expected them to be able to replicate the actual metallic paint in the ""5"" in the center, but the colors of this whole print are way off.Furthermore, the entire painting is not on this print- about an inch all the way around is missing- in the original painting, on the right hand side, the window says ""...ART CO."" however this print has the ""CO."" cut off.This print is going in the trash."
4,RECOMENDED,"THIS ALBUM IS A HOME STUDIO RECORDING FROM 1981 WHEN THEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE STATE HARRASMENT WAS THE HEAVIEST AND YOU COULD HEAR IT IN THIS WORK WHERE THE JOY DISAPPEARED AND DARK AND RELIGIOUS MOTIVS FOUND THEIR WAY OUT.GREAT ARTISTIC MOVE,HEAVY WITHOUT ANY REMORSE AS USUALY."
1,Warning: This is the MONO version!,"I would have really loved to have a modern CD transfer of this great album, but unfortunately this overpriced Japanese ""mini LP"" CD is the mono version."
3,Bossa Nova,"Probably anyone who likes bossa nova will like this mid-60s album containing great songs such as the ballad ""Winter Moon"", the lively, percussive ""Maracatu-Too"", and the standard ""Corcovado"". The recording isn't perfect, but it sufficiently displays the tones of Getz' sax and Almeida's guitar. The total time is quite short for CD, about a half-hour, but that's a minor concern considering the quality of the music."
5,Another Bossa Nova Classic,This is another Bossa Nova classic from the master of that style. I agree with previous reviewers that this record is as good as Getz/Gilberto and Jazz Samba. All tracks are sensational with beautiful flowing lines from Stan's sax.
2,"Please, people, PLEASE!",So Mishima finds out through exercise that he's been wasting his time with the writing. He writes all about that. Attention liberal: this review is helpful.
4,Did the job,"It performed as well as I expected in keeping ice off the windshield (not perfect, but pretty good) and was very cheap. Putting on/taking off was quick and simple. No complaints."
1,too small,"I have a full size sedan and this windshield cover was too small. It also tended to ""ride up"" the window and not keep the wipers covered."
3,Okay,Not as well made as it looks. A blanket or tarp would have worked just as well and for less money.
3,Good but not great,"The size of this is a bit small, it could be a bit larger in height. The biggest issue I have is the side ties. They are not in a location that helps keep this down. There should be two on each side, on top and bottom. As it is now there is one on each side right in the center. The top and bottom of this shield are not held down, so if there is any wind at all it flaps around in the wind. Only the center is secured.It works, and for the price I can't complain too much - but it doesn't do the job as well as it could if the design were a bit different."
2,I would rather scrape,"I dont care for this item. I would rather scrape the windshield off. The elastic is to short to hook onto anything. I bought two and they are going in with our rummage sale items, to be sold or given away."
2,Maybe it would've worked...?,"This may have been fantastic at preventing ice and snow from building up on my windshield, but I will never know since it blew away the first night I had it and is gone without a trace. I attached it pretty securely and it wasn't even that windy. Oh well, only $8, you get what you pay for and it was worth a shot."
4,surprised me...,"I read the other reviews that were positive and decided to give this a chance. Plainly stated, it works well - keeps frost and ice off of the windshield of the car my daughter uses to go to college - and most importantly, it keeps ME from getting up extra early to scrape frost/ice off of her windshield!It does seem a bit flimsy but it has held up for several weeks now. My suggestion is that if you feel like it's too windy out to trust the elastic bands, use your windshield wipers to help hold it down.It's also true that it's not full size - it doesn't completely cover the windshield, but it does cover over 80% and if you set it on there right, you probably won't have to scrape at all. it's a great value for the money - buy an extra one for the first one wears out."
1,Windshield screen,"I purchased two screens, one for each car, and I am very sorry for wasting my money.The elastic broke the first time I tried to attach it to the windshield. It was not worth the money I paid for it for sure. Perhaps this summer it might be draped across the dash INSIDE the car....just so I get some ""bang for my buck"". I am very disappointed."
3,Ok,"These are adequate. They could be better with magnets or weights because they won't lay flat when the wind is blowing, and they can be cumbersome to install."
5,GREAT PRODUCT.,the shield is easy to install and works great. I used to scrape frost off my girls cars for 10 minutesand now 2 seconds to remove the screen.
5,great,exactly what I was looking for; perfect - exactly what I was seeking - super sturdy; save your money - this is the one!!!
5,Great quality and price,"This windshield screen fits my Jeep Wrangler with plenty of excess, so I believe it would fit any car or average-size truck. It secures by closing the doors around the edges and by a strap that connects inside the car. The screen is thick, bendable, and has a good-quality reflective finish. I can see this screen lasting a long time. Excellent product and price"
2,Not Durable,"Very lightweight, strap came off after 1 week of use. Was unable to assess if it would protect the windshield frost and snow. In short, I got what I paid for."
5,Works as advertised,"I got two of these - one for the wife's car and one for mine. Installation is easy - simply lay it over the windshield with the doors open, fold the ""extra"" length on each side inside the front car doors, and hook the elastic connectors on both ends together inside the car, then shut the doors. Keeps off frost, ice, and snow. The only (minor) drawback is they're wet when you take them off, so you need to put them in the garage to dry out or pop them in the trunk and dry them later. Great price for saving all that scraping on cold winter mornings."
1,Waste of time and money,This product broke on the first use. One of the straps ripped off and the cover was flapping on one side of my car in the morning.
3,Worth a look but not all it is cracked up to be,"I have to say I have been perpetually disappointed with these books. I have used the electricity volume as supplemental information for an E&M course I taught with success. But I could not have turned the students aloose by themselves. These books are full of errors in math and even some in physics. Feynman never meant these books to become the holy grail of physics they have sort of become. These books are the babies of an experimental freshman physics course at Cal Tech designed to reduce the outflow to the EE department. Feynman considered the course a failure partly because of his lack of time and involvement. Nevertheless, I have read some of the material with a great deal of enjoyment. If nothing else these books can bring a tear to the student's eye over what could have been."
4,Classic text -- spring for the hardcover if you want yours to last,"These lectures are beautiful and imaginative beyond belief. They are better enjoyed by someone who already understands the basics of the material.WARNING: my paperback copies fell apart very quickly. The binding is of exceedingly low quality. Buy the hardback version, which seems to hold together much better."
5,For the love of physics ...,"Here's the deal. If ya wanna do this whole physics thing vanilla-style, go buy and read a nice physics textbook. If you want to taste physics - really take it in, like a delicious chocolate mousse or a symphony orchestra or Shakespeare done by British folk, this is where you have to be. If you have the resources, the best way to really dive in is to listen to the actual lectures and use these great sets of books as a resource as you go along - and then to take it all in again afterwards (and the books clean up the mistakes here and there in the lectures).I am not a scientist nor an engineer, I just like to learn stuff from the best and this is the best. When my wife asks me why I am laughing to a man in the 1960's lecturing about ""the characteristics of forces"" (Volume 1, Chapt. 12), it is truly an inside joke that cannot be explained, but instead must be experienced.Textbook vs. Laurence Olivier, ... the choice was simple for me, and I will never be the same."
5,Great,"I really enjoyed packing volume three with me on a recent vacation trip. Feynman amazes me with his clarity of thought, clear explanations, and wonderful sense of humor. Why should there be anything difficult about the fundamentals of nature? You really see how simple things are at the bottom, and only get clouded when working out the details. Feynman clearly separates the essence from the messy mathematical details of implementation. I love how he beats a horse to death in one dimension before generalizing! I'm sure that's how all great minds work. Few books on quantum mechanics are of such a high caliber. Volume three is a treasure!"
2,Schaum's>Feynman Lectures,"Hype is absolutely right; If you want to really learn physics you have to be solving problems and as Gregory mentioned there are NO exercises. Of course if we were stranded on a deserted island we would be satisified with constructing our own problems I guess. Anyway,if you don't need Feynman's LONG! explanations and want to do some thinking for yourself get Spiegel's Schaum's outline or a Paul Davies book for enlightenment."
4,feynman lectures on physics,"I ordered this set of books for my son, therefore, I am unable to review the product. However, the books arrived a couple of days after they were expected."
5,The most beautiful book I've ever read,"The only problem with this book is that once you start reading it, and you fall in love with it, it's next to impossible to stop. Chapter are beautifully organized, they are not too long, too wordy or too short. You are sure when you start it, even if it takes some extra effort you'll be able to finish it. Here and there in between the lines Feynman reveals many of the astonishing secrets of nature; You can't just sit there and remain speechless, you'll say: ""Hey, that's right!"" My major is physics, and I claim I've seen more physics text books than average physicists, but this is different, this is a hilarious masterpice."
5,This is Inside Physics,"This is a three volume set. The set explains just about every subject in physics. What makes this set so good is its emphasis on the physical comcepts rather than on heavy mathematics derivation. The explanations are original and the examples are practical in both pure researches and applications. If you like physics, this set is priceless."
3,Was an okay read,"An interesting read, good for the beach in the summer. Not very memorable though. I read through it pretty quickly."
2,Bland and Soggy....Cocoa Puffs.,"I thought this book was a little bit comedic in some areas while completely over analytical in others. I don't want to read six pages of analyzing Saved by the Bell. It's a kid show, it's not meant to be taken seriously. Sometimes, things should just be looked at in the big picture, enjoyed for what it was.Some parts were funny, interesting, but I found myself sort of drifting away... It became too rhetoric, too much like a lecture in which someone is telling you what's ""uberly"" important and what sucks. It became really bland, really fast."
3,Manifesto?,"This book is only mildly funny and outdated. It seems like a bad rendition of the books he references, like ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius."" The section on mixtapes is uninspired- ""Love is a Mixtape,"" by Rob Sheffield is much more successful. This book produced no mindblowing or even relatively interesting ideas- a waste of time if you ask me."
4,Quite good...,"Klosterman's book reads like a pop culture Bill Hicks, with a sense of humor that makes one laugh first, but then you realize he's being completely serious with the essays he's discussing, making the reader think more about subjects never considered before.Luke Skywalker was the first GenXer. Pamela Anderson is the equal to Marilyn Monroe in sex stars. John Cusack is a large reason why relationships don't last. Average women have taken over mainstream porn. Saved by the Bell re-establishes our American value system.If these sound like conversations you've had with your friends you'll like this book. If not, then maybe you'll start the talks after reading it."
3,Okay...Worth Reading Just Once,"He's incisive, Klosterman. A bit TOO incisive (Does Pamela Anderson's sex appeal deserve such time & insight? Course not!). But--I have to admit--the author makes me laugh on occasion. And this is his only saving grace. He's best taken in SMALL doses. He just goes too FAR into EVERYTHING. It makes for annoying reading. At least as far as pop culture goes..."
4,Fun read,"Klosterman takes a look at society while using pop culture. It's funny, interesting look at society in relation to popular culture. I found myself actually agreeing with his points in many of the essays."
2,"Insightful but, repetitive","While this book offers much insight into human nature, it offers very little pop culture analysis. The stories Klosterman uses are laced with his nostalgia and contain very little relateable knowledge; it is much like a personal diary. Finally, Klosterman uses many of the techniques he comments on in the book and thusly tries to avoid, making the book very hypocritical. Nevertheless, he employs some very interesting views points, which ultimately led me to read the book with a highlighter to remember them."
4,clever,"I liked this book. I can't say I loved it (hence, the 4 stars), but I really liked it. Crafty, clever, and every bit of life should have a soundtrack.He knows his pop culture and he has a way of reminding you of what you thought you knew but had 'mis'-forgotten. Clever material ranging from Zach Morris to Pam Anderson to Billy Joel. A quick read and the kind of read that actually provides interesting resources for how to look at what only appears to be the benign things that constitute this culture. Good stuff."
3,Elvis Lives...a tribute show,"Chuck Klosterman has obviously read plenty of Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis. He seems to be trying to write the next BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY. I think he tries too hard, though. He's not writing his voice, he's writing an attempt to emulate the voice of other writers. He does a good job and the stories are interesting, but there is the soul of the writer missing from the book that you get when it's a writer's authentic voice and not an imitation. Even the best Elvis Impersonator is still and impersonator. If you want to read the next BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY, buy MY FRACTURED LIFE because it has that authentic voice. I'm not saying don't buy SEX, DRUGS, AND COCO PUFFS, just know you're going to see a tribute show."
1,he should get over himself,There are only 3 or 4 books I would not read to the end in my entire life. I did not enjoy it at all. He needs to get over himself.
2,Great Cover!,"The cover and the title are the only things this book has going for it.I was not even able to finish this book.Couldn't get through the first three chapters.I was hoping for something interesting and funny- but it was mundane and boring- seemed like the author is jaded by what he sees in the world, and it definitely shows on the pages.There was nothing to the book but mindless pop culture references that went on and on and on- but no real STORY. It felt like I was reading a script to an E! Entertainment episode, but without the corny banter by the co-hosts.I love pop culture, but I also love a good plot and at least some semblance of a storyline.Not worth it."
5,A Delightful Afternoon,"was spent speeding through this incredibly hilarious book- I found myself involuntarily laughing loudly at regular junctions at the neighborhood B+N to the nearby readers' chagrin. This book cleverly dissects pop culture with a razor eye and slices up everything that's hip, serving it back to us in a slightly recognizable form. From the first page on, I was hooked, hooked to the 26 questions that actually sent me reeling in deep contemplation, to the segue on the similarities between apples and oranges, to the existential dilemmas of The Sims characters, to the Real World, to Pamela Anderson. I could recognize these cultural landmarks, but in the author's skillful hands, they were transformed into brilliance. From on, I know I'll know never to look at pop culture in the same way. And just for kicks, I bought a used copy of Vanilla Sky on my way home."
3,Senseless Rambling,"If I was looking for some random perspectives on life (such as which Billy Joel album is the best, or why Real World characters are all the same), I would spend more time with my parents. At least then I would get a free dinner!"
1,not even worth my 83 cents,"worst piece of hipster garbage i have ever read. it doesn't even deserve the one star i was obligated to give it. i thought it would be more of a story but instead you get the opinions of some old man on crap no one cares about. thought this book would be much different since it was a suggestion based on other books i bought, but i wish i would have saved the 83 cents i paid for this and spent it at taco bell."
1,The book is age sensitive,If you are in your late forties or older you will probably not understand 80% of the references made in the book. It is probably a great book for younger people who understand what the author is referring to. If you didn't watch 'Real World' on HBO or if you don't know who Billy Sim is you probably won't like this book. On the other hand if you are a Generation X person it is probably very funny.
4,Must Read for Gen X'ers,"This book completely describes so many people in my generation it's crazy.Great writing, really funny at times. Just an all a round good read!"
4,Very Entertaining.,"Klosterman's book was well worth the price on the cover. His essays are very witty; any book that makes you laugh out loud several times is definitely a keeper. The stories are insightful looks at the things that seem to mean so little but always seem to mean so much- television shows, video games, music, and others. Also of interest are the brief ""asides"" between each essay, which give even smaller portions of Klosterman's wit.The reason I hesitate to give this book the full five stars is that it seemed a bit uneven to me- that is to say, not all the essays were of the same caliber. However, the best ones are good enough to make you forgive some of the ones that never quite click."
2,An oxymoron for Gen Xers,"I decided to read this book after considering the many positive reviews along with the accolades of several independent book sellers. I shouldn't have. I'm not going to say this book is bad, but its certainly not anywhere near being good either.This book is a self-described manifesto, which it is not. It is the inane ramblings of someone who does not suffer from lycantrophy. It is dysfunctional, poorly written, and is essentially about nothing at all. I liken it to a Seinfeld episode, in print form, but without the distraction that comes from actual humor or entertainment value. In hind site, I'm starting to wish Klosterman did suffer from lycantrophy.If you don't believe me, I will let a Chuck Klosterman quote from the book serve as a one line synopsis:""Do you not see what I am no longer not saying to you? If so-congratulations!"""
2,Meh,"It was impossible to read these essays and not imagine that they were typed as spouted, realtime, by a smart, overcaffeinated english major sitting on a couch in a dormitory. You can almost see the (cheap, industrial) carpeting and hear the 'k-cchunk' of the vending machine in the background.This can be fun, but what we all learned in college is that it's important not to take couch-speaker-guy's opinions as seriously as he takes them. That's the case here, too. Klosterman guesses at things when ninety seconds of googling would have given him the facts; he makes assertions and then, rather than backing them up, goes on to further assertions, possibly in hopes that you'll be too busy trying to keep up to start poking holes in his argument; and every now and then, despite his open contempt for people who use words without understanding their meanings, he does this himself (e.g. describing this collection as a 'manifesto')."
3,Entertaining In Most Places,"Since cracking open the spine of David Sedaris' Naked, I have had a newfound love for the art of the essay. A friend loaned me this copy, with the advice, ""Just wait till you get to the Zack Morris part!"" Despite my temptation, I did read the essays in consecutive order. And overall, this is a funny collection - yes, the Zack Morris essay was definitely my favorite, but I also enjoyed the large section of hypothetical questions. The book is definitely heavy on MTV's Real World references, which didn't interest me as much as Saved By The Bell. I found the collection to be a bit uneven, with some essays definitely stealing the limelight more than others - like the one on the ""serial killer connections""! It will be interesting to see what other topics Klostermann will tackle."
3,quite presumptuous,"Klosterman's evident opinions prevail over sound logic most of the time in this analysis of 90s pop culture. i found it hard to take anything he said seriously after his rant about soccer, which was nothing more than an ignorant diatribe surely founded out of some insecure fallacy. However, this is not to say that some of the sociological implications discussed in his essays did not make for thought-provoking literary fare..."
3,Yes and No,"Very good and funny at times, very slow and boring at other times.This book is a tribute to older days and in it's own perfect way itis the bipolar teenager it tries to capture. Still enjoyable though."
4,Like a blog...published,"Klosterman for president. Loved the book loved his crazy ability to connect pop culture to collective societal conciousness that may only exist to Chuck himself. Nevertheless, I found myself agreeing with him alot of times or just going with it. The essay that really stuck out to me as literary genious was the missing sock one. Histerical. The 23 questions? Brilliant! It made up for the sports references and defending country music(why I gave it 4 stars and not 5). I heart this guy."
1,A better use of your time would be hari kari,"I heard rave reviews about this book from a large number of people and my roommate had it sitting on his desk so I picked it up and read it. Upon finishing I put it down and thought, ""wow, that was the most abysmal piece of literature I have ever read."" Klosterman is like a 40 year old kid who, quite obviously has no semblence of a life, because not only has seen every episode of every ""Real World"" ever not once, but 3 times, and then decided it was worth his time to write an essay on how it has skewed the views of our society. WHAT??!?!!?!? In short Klosterman wastes 253 pages of good trees to tell us his revalatory findings after trying to get laid in the SIMS after sitting in his basement for over a weeks worth of hours playing it and other completely-irrelevent-to-life topics. And then he wonders why he can't get a girlfriend...Go figure."
4,A Refreshing Diversion,"As the subtitle implies, Klosterman has spent more time and energy thinking deeply about ""low culture"" than most academics have spent studying the so-called ""important"" things.This is not an indictment: Pondering things that aren't terribly important -- like what it's like to be in a Guns-N-Roses Tribute Band (for example) -- can be quite refreshing. In fact, I found it to be a welcome diversion from my normal diet of political books.Granted, as a fellow Gen Xer who spent some time in North Dakota, I probably identified with Klosterman more than, say, a 50-year old from New York might. But I figure if every Gen Xer in North Dakota were to purchase this book -- that's at least 250 copies, right there!In all seriousness, I think this book would resonate best with people born between 1968 and 1978."
4,"You don't have to agree with him, just sit back and read it","I loved this book. I disagreed with the author on about a good third of the material, especially his views on Soccer, but we're all entitled to our opinions. I did appreciate reading an opposing point of view that was rarely offensive, except again, in his diatribe against soccer.There really isn't much more I can add to these reviews that others haven't put in already. This was one of the smartest and funniest books I have ever read. Its not for the type of person who accepts the world at face value; instead its for the type of person who questions everything, and can live with an opposing viewpoint without tossing the book down in anger."
3,Brain Candy,"The book is worth a read. Chuck Klosterman's insights on pop culture subjects are fun and interesting, and are reminicent of times spent BS-ing with friends at a bar. But, much like many ""bar"" conversations, you gain no insight from all that wasted breath. At the bar you spend a lot of time flapping your gums, trying to be witty and astute, but you just wake up the next morning with a hang-over and a vague memory of all the #$%& you made up. So, if you just want to hear a guy's opinions about some random stuff, this is a fun read, but you will find yourself reading it over again, from time to time, because it's a little insipid."
1,sex drugs and bollox,not funny chuck....i want my money back. oh...and your cusak poll is assinine. i am sure jc would agree. i will make sure to read your stuff first before being suckered in on kindle. and sims? shame on you.
3,Read with a grain of Salt!,I thought this was a good book that captured my generation in a nutshell. I wouldn't take it too seriously. It was very opinionated...most of which I agreed with. I read a lot of it on the subway and found myself laughing out loud. I definitely dont think I gained any insiteful knowledge from reading the book but found it entertaining.
4,"Good book -- some errors, but good","Hackett's book does good at introducing microeconomics from an Environmental perspective. The content is not very weighty, and in fact makes for gentle, yet, stimulating reading. He opens by discussing ""Ethical Systems of thoughts"" and differentiating between price and value. His book then delves a bit deeper into the actual theory whereupon we are introduced to Marginal Benefits, Marginal Costs, Equilibrium, & Market Failure, which is precursory to Externalities. He's even bold enough to introduce Kantian ethics in his short discourse which also includes deontology and teleology. The book is well structured, and although interspersed with some errors (which Hackett has apparently desisted from communicating with me about) it's a swell book overall.I definitely recommend reading this book alongside Ian Hodge's ""Environmental Economics"""
2,Woefully Incomplete,"For a dictionary so thick, this one certainly lacks a LOT of very basic words. After looking up just a few words, I quickly fell back to using my much slimmer Japanese-English/English-Japanese resource, because this one just doesn't have the information. A lot of space is taken up by larger-than-normal font size and spacing. I'm still looking for a good English-Japanese dictionary, but until then, almost anything is better than this."
4,Nelson Riddle's lush orchestra backs Peterson's trio,"The great Oscar Peterson trio with Oscar on piano, Ray Brown on bass, and Ed Thigpen on drums is augmented here by the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. There are a few trio recordings sans orchestra from a few years earlier thrown in as well. The orchestral arrangements are lush and full, but with lots of room for the trio's improvisational genius, especially Peterson's. This CD is a great value, with over 60 minutes of music and excellent sound quality."
1,Usually Garmin gives value for money....,"... but not this time. This is a very expensive and embarrassingly deficient collection of out of date information, and very extensive areas of the United States are simply unmentioned."
3,For the road warrior only,This is a good investment if you travel to LARGE cities often. It is quite expensive for the casual traveler for what it delivers.
3,"OK, *IF* the area of interest is covered (a big if!)","So far this has been a disappointment. I assumed this would cover most of the U.S., but it's limited to very large cities and the most popular tourist destinations, about 100 areas in all. Many states have *no* coverage. And coverage is limited to (at most)50 items per category. So even for major cities it lists only 50 hotels, 50 restaurants, etc, and many times far less. The SD card is 128mb, but only 20mb is used for data! You can copy the data from the SD card to the GPS, and there is no activation code, so the data isn't locked to a single GPS.Most expensive 20MB of data I ever bought."
2,Limited use if you don't live in a highly populated city.The price is not warranted to its usefulness.,"Garmin needs to have a chip to up-grade changes in the NUVI 660 in the restaurant section each year.This week I went to three places coded in for Italain,two had changed and one was out of business."
1,unimpressed,"I installed this in my new Garmin Nuvi GPS prior to making a trip to Iowa City, Iowa. Thought that it would provide some information useful about the City and the surrounding area. Found that there is not a single location in the memory that covers anywhere in Iowa. This is advertised as a North American travel guide. Did they move Iowa?"
3,Not what I was expecting,"Well, maybe I was expecting too much but for the $50+ price I was expecting much greater coverage of the entire country. Not being a prior Fodor's guide user I was expecting this guide to be much more like the Michelin guides I used when in Europe. Wrong! The level of detail and coverage outside of just a few of the major metro areas is minimal to nonexistant. This product should be called ""An Overview Of Selected Sites In North America"" Not worth the money!"
1,Useless,"Product has little information about even major metro areas, let alone less populated ones. Totally useless."
2,not for small towns,"maybe useful for big cities or fancy hotels,resturants; no good for trip planning; better to get the Gamin CD map updae or update online"
1,Rip-off!,"Garmin and Fodors should be ashamed of this product. The coverage is absurd. In Washington D.C. I looked for a restaurant near my current location. Nada, but I was surrounded by a wide variety of places to eat, some of them very highly rated by local media. This guide wanted me to go most of the way across town, an expensive cab ride, to a neighborhood that I was advised wasn't very safe. You're better off to Google the city before you visit and take along a few pages of printouts. Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage."
3,"Terrific, But With Some Narrative Creeps","This is one where a reader must take the good with the bad. The good is that Chapin provides an insider's account of the incredibly rich and powerful musical, Follies. His thoughts about the casting, staging, and scoring of this production puts it entirely into context. There is not another work like this.The bad is when Chapin creeps into the narrative. Really, nobody cares (or at least I don't) about what it was like to pick up set designs at various New York apartments or what it was like to run errands. The story is bigger than the author and, occasionally, he seems to forget this.In all, then, this is an important book -- with some faults -- that is critical to understanding one of the greatest achievements in American theater."
4,Useful and Sturdy Scholarship,"This book seems somewhat dated, but that may be because it has inspired so much research on the importance of marriage and ceremony that the ideas appear familiar. One easily forgets that this is the book that opened the way to new approaches to Shakespeare's plays. When my students want to write about the importance of ceremony or about women or about marriage in Shakespeare's plays, I first send them to *Broken Nuptials*. It's nicely written with no twisted inane jargon to trip up even a novice reader. Most readers, in fact, may end the book thinking ""I knew that!"" (although they probably didn't know it when they started the book). The insights appear to be so self-evident (and so colored by work done after the book's publication) that I believe readers and scholars, while recognizing the book's importance, have underrated its quality. This book is an excellent tool that stands the test of time."
4,mmhmm,this cd is amazing! it has a bunch of great songs on it. it's almost perfect! but i could have expected a little more from it. it's great...but i dunno. i really reccommend it though. it's great! but only if you really like iron mask to i reccommend this cd.
5,Precisely the book I've been dreaming of...,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: a general reference to hundreds of ""everyday"" situations Java Web developers face. Just as any cookbook, it doesn't go into the ""deepest"" details about every little thing, and it does give examples of ways to not reinvent the wheel. Some reviewers see this as worthy of only 1 star... This is only a 1 star book for readers who like to reinvent the wheel and waste time on unnecessary details... if you're like me and have deadlines to meet, you'll find what you need here quickly and efficiently."
4,Overlooked Classic,"As one of the later Maigret novels, I think this sometimes gets written off as something Simenon cobbled together hastily. It's more reflective than usual, but the mystery is tight and succinct. The contrasts between Maigret and his wife with the toy salesman and his wife are poignant and revealing. The setup is unusually good - a slow day at the office produces a fine problem. The toy salesman thinks his wife wants to do him in. The wife insists that he's crazy and is trying to harm her. Who to believe?The resulting death I shall let the book reveal, but with such a small cast of suspects, Simenon produces a clever twist that is psychologically and dramatically satisfying. Character and story move forward with Simenon's typically economic style."
2,Fragile and loose parts,"I got the Belle doll for my 4 year old daughter at Target, on sale. The shoes don't stay on her feet at all. The necklace falls off easily and will snap the moment one of us steps on it by accident.... And the crown is already cracked through on one piece and will soon fail completely. The dress is made of cheap, poorly sewn fabric and poor Belle's chignon didn't last 15 minutes because the crown is attached to the hair. As soon as my daughter tried to pull off the crown (because that is what little girls do), the hair came out of the bun and now looks like a rat's nest. But my daughter seems not to care because she just adores Belle, even if she's barefoot.Beware of the ""free"" ring for your girl: The ring is actually the end of the scepter, so if you snap off the ring for wearing, the scepter is reduced to just a plain plastic stick -- not very exciting."
5,Great complete breakaway system,"Easy to setup, good instructions. The lights help you see what is going on (battery status, charging...) and diagnosing wiring issues is easy.The included battery was already charged and the box is easy to mount on the trailer. Overall a great solution, you won't need anything else to setup a breakaway system on your trailer."
5,best bang for your buck,"top quality,for the price you cant beat it.ez install. less than the cost of a new bat you get it all.works perfect. better than org."
2,Dew detector light is a big problem,"We almost bought the PCV-L552 for its big view finder and 27x optical zoom, but after a lot of digging on obscure web sites, we found this older camera suffers from a dew detector light that goes off too easily, shutting down camera for hours. The PV-L424 just came out in 2004."
4,Prior Reviews Are Not of This Set,I have not heard all of this set yet. I have the box Verve box set too and it is really great. The Verve Songbook Box has lots of the same material as included in this box set.The point of my writing this review is that all the prior reviews of this set are really from earlier issues of Ella's music. None of the reviews are of this set. All of the other reviews are dated before this set actually was released.More later.
3,Hawke's Pride,"I had a hard time rating this. I decide to go ahead and give it 3.5 stars instead of a 3 stars. It could have been a good story, but she left parts of it out she shouldn't have. Hawke and Rue went from arguing and hating each other, to skip forward at least a month and he's been courting her. Then they get together once, and then it skips forward another month. Things are good between them, and Rue gets taken away by force and made to think Hawke is trying to get rid of her. So at least the last quarter of the book they are not even together. So not only did she skip the courting, she skipped any of the part where their marriage was good. There is not really much of any sex in this one. For some reason it just did not grab my attention as well, and was not a quick easy read for me. Not that it was horrible, because it wasn't. I just felt like something was lacking in the story."
4,some romance,"this was an okay book, the plot was some what good, the first couple of chapters was not bad then it started to become boring then it picked back up. the story begins with rue living in poverty and with a mother who is a whore and a stepfather who wants to have sex with her then when she kicks him in the nuts he wants to kill her. she marries hawk who is mean to her, then whats to cheat on her with a married woman calls her all kinds of names then fall in love with her, the sex in this book was not good at all when i think of a love story this was not what i had in mind. it was almost not worth putting sex in the book it was very virgin."
4,Fun but maybe not for true gamers...,"One of the things I like best about this game is that you use the controls different then most other games of this type and that alone can pose a new and interesting challenge. The only negative thing I can say about this game is the cut scenes are a little too long, the boss battles are very easy once you find out the secrets to destroy them and sometimes constant changing of gadgets can slightly put a drag on play time. Overall this is a good game that will hold your interest. It is a GREAT game for kids (9 and up), maybe not really young first timers, as they may have trouble figuring out which item to use at which time. It can pose enough challenge to be fun for anyone, the mini games are fun as well. I recommend getting cheats to find the hidden rooms for the last morph."
3,A movie about the wrong kind of off-roading.,"Adrien Brody does a respectable job carrying the movie, but carry it he must as the story runs out before the film does. Would probably have made an excellent short film cut to somewhere between 40 and 60 minutes. Even at its full running time, though, it's not unrewarding."
3,A bit short on flair,"This movie fell short of its potential. I'm going to step delicately here so as not to reveal the wrap. All that was needed was a lot more back story and less of the woods. You have to sprinkle in the back story throughout the film to keep you guessing and to keep your interest. The reveal is all tucked in at the end. This is why people are saying it was slow, which it is. Very good performance by Brody, just needed some help from the script."
2,Old Time Radio fun,"Second of the three movies based on the ""Fibber McGee & Molly"" radio comedy. This one isn't quite as funny as the first film, but has some amusing bits for those who know the characters from radio. There are some rather surreal bits with Charlie McCarthy prancing around on his own without Edgar Bergen, and a politically-incorrect visit to an Indian reservation.Mildly amusing and probably a great hit in its day when everyone in America would have known all the characters intimately."
5,Experiencing God Thru Prayer,Staying focused on Christ seems to be my biggest problem. This book has been most helpful in keeping me focused and is the insturment that God seems to be using to teach me to have a closer union with Him. I recommend this book to everyone who desires a closer relationship with Jesus.
5,Profound and convincing.,"Madame Guyon's guide to prayer demonstrates that salvation is afar more profound transformation than is realized by most people who call themselves Christians today. The reviewer who criticized her views on perfection forgets that Christ Himself said, ""Be ye therefore perfect."" Madame Guyon was persecuted by the Catholic church during her lifetime -- for reasons of jealousy, I believe. She obviously attained something very profound and wrote this guide in a sincere attempt to communicate it."
2,There's Better,"Everyone has their own fave Billie Holiday, I guess - this ain't mine. It's mostly remakes made in the 50's, and they sound antiseptic compared with the originals. In particular ""Strange fruit"" a song about lynching, is undercut by an amateur, theatrical piano. It's not that Billie lost her touch (aircheck recordings from the 50's reveal brilliance), but Verve really undercut her voice here. Too bad."
3,good textbook. but....,"During the lecture on the abstract algebra 1, Jacobson's book was the main textbook. Although his book is regarded as ""bible"" by some professors, I cannot help confessing thath i need another reference book which explains the material in more detail and more carefully. So I consult Frayleigh's algebra textbook whenever I hit upon something difficult to understand on jacobson's. Frayleigh's book is kinder, not to economize explanations and examples. Jacobson is one of the top-class mathematian, but his fame doesn't assure his book's efficiency. His book is written too abstractively. I don't want to recommend this book to the beginers although it has the title ""basic""."
2,Very confusing most of the time,"I dislike the book for two main reason:1)the author hides information in essay-style paragraphs which usually end in phrases like, ""thus, we have proved..."". If you are lucky, he will somewhere state the theorem.2) because of 1) it serves as a poor reference book, which is the main subsequent value of a text after you have taken the course with it.I do share some of the enthusiasm that Richard has for the book, but only for those parts of the book that I already understood from previous work. We actually took the class together at UC Santa Barbara. And from what I remember, Richard was one of the few students who had anything good to say about the book. I think a better graduate text is Hungerford's or Grove's (""Algebra"")."
3,Elegant but terse,"This book is written extremely well. It is very elegantly worded, to the point where it is very difficult to follow. A glossary would have been nice. I found myself backtracking several times per section to keep track of the jargon flying around. I recommend Stillwell's undergraduate and Robert Ash's graduate books instead. Ash's book is less elegant than this, but more straightforward and formatted more accessibly. Also, the title may be one of the biggest misnomers in the history of textbooks; ""Basic Algebra I"" sounds like the title of a junior high textbook, not a graduate school-level one. I'm guessing that this is a good reference if you already know abstract algebra like the back of your hand; but to learn it, there are many more accessible texts at this level."
2,"The man is great, the book is not","This is not an easy book to learn from. The material is there but organized in a very poor way. Important results and theorems are often hidden in the middle of page long paragraphs. The index is so bad they might as well not have included it. The information is all there, but unless you read every word in the text from beginning to end, you just won't be able to get to it. I used Hungerford to get through my first graduate classes in algebra, which is too brief but definitely a step up from this. This is a poorly organized text written by a truly great mathematician."
2,2 stars is all it desirves,"Unfortunately, I was one of those idiots who bought Gamecube over PS2. I bought SSB:M, Rogue Leader, THPS3, Spy Hunter, and Cel Damage. Spy Hunter is the worst game of them all! The levels are too dark. The graphics on the otehr hand arent that bad. The weapons are too limited. The movies are horrible, especially the Saliva one! I bought this game knowing nothing about it. I regret I spent the [money] or so on this ""game"". The Multiplayer mode isn't fun at all. They need a deathmatch or something! I don't find killing a bunch of chickens fun (though I do find it quite amusing)! Trust me, this game is a total waste of money, no exceptions."
1,Horrible and Agonizing Gameplay,"There is no question this is the worst racing game I have ever played. Extremely difficult and frustrating to play, its just NOT fun. I returned the five day rental after 2 hours of torment. Great racing games: F-Zero (Super Nes), F-Zero X (N64), Crusin USA (N64), Rumble Racing (PS2) (cheesy graphics but fun gameplay), Tokyo Extreme Racer (Dreamcast) (Fantastic graphics and gameplay). :)"
2,"Horrible, horrible frame rate","The game starts out great. The training missions are fast, smooth and fun. I have to assume that all the high reviews are from people who've just started playing it.The problem is, once you start the actual missions, the frame rate seems to drop noticably, presumably because of all the extra objects the game has to draw. Not only that, but the frame rate becomes uneven, which makes targeting anything while on the move rather annoying. The pixelated graphics don't help, and the faux-3D is rather obvious.When you compare it to (say) ""Burnout 2"", it's clear that very little effort was spent to get the game running acceptably on the GameCube. I've seen smoother graphics on PS2 games (I own both systems). Definitely one to steer clear of."
5,not to shabby,"This game should be rated high because it includes plenty of action and non stop levels they never end and you get a variety of selections for weapons and vehicles. It just keeps getting harder and harder as the levels progress, It's sweeet!!! It is clearly one of the best games there are!"
1,The worst game I've ever played--including those on my C64,The game is horribly frustrating on PC/Mac platforms because it lacks the ability to save in the middle of a level. Thus the game becomes a play-fail-try again endless loop if you miss the tiniest part of a particular level.Just utter garbage. I would *literally* rather watch an hour of white noise on TV than wish this game on anyone.
1,Shoot: Repeat,"If you liked the original spy hunter, you'll probably not like this one. as in dont go and buy this game just because the first one was fun. IT [IS TERRIBLE]! Plain out. the graphics are very poor and i know the gamecube can handle more than that. and all the levels are the SAME MISSION! it's always do this do that repeat! i wouldn't even recoment renting this game, go get James Bond (much better game!) But do what you want, i cant force you to not make the same mistake i did."
1,3 words,"Those 3 words are- sloppy,stupid, and ugly. After playing this game, I am so happy that I bought 007 instead. As you know both are ports of ps2 games, with one major difference- james bond has actually been improved on, and spy hunter has been cut up. It is an extremely sloppy port from the ps2 version. Graphics just plain stink, pretty much no real damage to anything at all, and it gets boring faster than the levels can load. There are driving levels on james bond, and, sad to say, they are better than this whole game! And you get to shoot suff and have multiplayer. But seriously, on the driving 007 levels there is real damage and all the weapons and gadgets of spy hunter, so just get it and have fun running into ped cars."
2,A disappointment,"Dark Tranquillity's first album for Century Media is a disappointment. Excessive keyboards cloud the mix, and Mikael Stanne's clean vocals are cringe-inducing. The mood is mid-tempo quasi-goth, suggesting a second-rate Sisters of Mercy. The songs run long, the hooks are few, and the band isn't tight. Skip this album in favor of later, stronger efforts."
4,No Disappointments Here,"I carry this tool in my everyday bag and it has been very useful. I generally carry another knife so the plain blade gets little use, but I have found almost all the other tools useful. I read some complaints about the tool being tight and difficult to operate. Well, mine was a little tight, but after a little lubrication and a night of playing with it while watching TV it works great. Even though the deal I got here was a pretty good one I do wonder what the profit margins are at Leatherman. After years in manufacturing I really see very little to make me believe this tool cost anywhere near $100 to produce. Anyway, at the end of the day I have no real complaints with this item."
5,Tops 'em all,"I've owned several Leatherman multitools over the years, including the original PST classic, and can say after a year of regular (ab)use that the Leatherman Charge tops 'em all. I've had opportunity to use each tool, and none are lacking. The *only* downside of this multitool that I've run into (many times) is that you must be careful when using the pliers to not pinch your skin between the sharp outer edges of the folded blades."
4,"Awesome, but...","I really like this product. It is high quality materials, well made, great utility, etc. My only issue (and admittedly it's a small one) is the pliers don't have a spring to open the pliers. Other than than little item, I highly recommend this tool."
2,Was expecting more,"I recieved the item and the first thing I noticed was the fit and finish was not what I had expected. The S30 blade seemed to have a dull finish and was not a razor sharpness I expected. It is also very stiff when opening but this could be because it's new. I would of kept the item unitl I noticed the locking mechanism on the saw did not work. I decided to return it. For something that costed me over $100 and list for $160 I expected it to have a better finish and have no flaws.I am a avid leatherman fan as I have the kick, which is nice, and the surge, which is awesome. Huge, but awseome. I have not had any issue with either of these models. I may try another charge or maybe a wave or skelton tool. Not sure yet."
3,Just buy the Wave instead.,"This tool could've been great, but they could not even grind the stop on the blade properly. And the proprietary driver bits... Nice touch, but breaking one would suck - need to get the replacement from Leatherman only. They are having the GM syndrome - too many products and lowering attention to detail. Original Wave tool was way more inspiring."
2,richardville,As other reviews have stated mine came used. There were tips missing. The tips in the unit were wore. The knife looked like a teenager tried to sharpen it. The tip was blue from getting too hot. I have carried a Surge for many years(don't leave home without it) and wanted to try the Charge. I expect better from both Amazon and Leatherman.
4,Better,Better than the other 2 Leatherman products I've owned (and liked). I would rate this 5 stars if the plyers had a spring or some method that kept them open while using them. This is the only reason I still carry my Gerber as often as this Leatherman.
5,Great multi-tool!,I use this thing almost every day. The belt case is great; the Leatherman Charge has bailed me out of many jams. The bit-driver function is simply awesome. I would recomend this product to anyone.
5,Best multi-tool ever,"The Leatherman Charge TTi is at the top of the multi-tool evalutionary scale. Well designed and made. Its often easier to grab this than to dig through my tool box looking for a specific tool. After I've completed the task at hand, I go looking for more things to fix because I don't want to put it away. I've had either Leatherman or Gebers that were really nice, but this is the one to get. Highly recommend it."
3,Comes with the clip and screw bits,"The knife came really tight on the hinges, more so than I thought was prudent. Also it comes wtih the clip and extra bits as it's part of the tin. Amazon doesn't tell you that! I think I like the Leatherman WAVE a bit better than this one. Still a great knife just not sure it's worth the extra $$$ over wave."
1,Terrible quality control.,"The Charge TTi that I received was stuck on one side so the bottle opener and screwdriver would not open or lock correctly. I understand that titanium can be difficult to work with, but something like this should have never made it past quality control. A defect like this is totally unacceptable, especially on a Leatherman that costs over $100. I am very disappointed and will be returning this tool immediately."
4,"Tough, but I'm still tougher","I am a big fella with a strong grip. My wife calls me Bam-Bam since I always break things by accident around the hours due to my size and strength. That's my background.I am a carpenter, business owner, avid outdoorsman, and am very rough on my equipment. I've broken every Leatherman (wave, etc...) so far, so I figured I'd try titanium. Why order more of the same brand if I always break them? -Because I fully admit I misuse them. I pry things, cut, break, saw, and dismember things with my multi-tool, and really don't expect for it to last. My first Leatherman Ti I broke like the others. But it wasn't easy, but I also wasn't trying. It also rusted in salt water so don't think Titanium is rust-proof, but again, my fault. So I bought another.This is a VERY tough knife, and probably won't break for you unless you're 260lbs with muscle, and have a bone-crunching grip."
4,Inside tools too hard to use,"I like the outside tools, especially the knife, but the inside tools are too hard to open -- I found I was using a second screwdriver to open the scissors, can/bottle opener, and screwdrivers.The inside tools were too tight. I immediately felt like putting oil on them or trying to loosen the security screws. I thought from all the descriptions that I had read, that pressing the release levers would also release the inside tools when they were closed, but they don't. You need long, strong fingernails or a second tool to open the inside tools.I don't have fingernails, and I like the one-handed operation of the outside tools, but the inside tools are not accessible, even if I had fingernails -- I must pry them open with a small screwdriver.It's also a little too heavy for everyday carry.I therefore returned the unit. I'll probably go for the Skeletool CX."
3,Malfunction,"I set out to purchase the Charge TTI, but wanted to see it and compare with the wave before purchasing because of the substantial cost difference. I went to the local army surplus and the owner handed me a charge TTI. I opened it and closed it and it would not reopen. I had him try and he got out his wave from his belt and tried to open it. No luck. He said it happened to him once before where the pliers go too deep into the unit and become lodged under the other tool. He said he was going to send it back because it would break if he tried to pry the other tool which held the pliers closed. I was shocked that there would be that kind of a design flaw on a $130 tool. Perhaps it was just that one tool, but when he said that was the second time it happened and he chose to carry the wave, that was enough to convince me not to spend the extra money."
5,great tool!!!,"CHARGE TTI,MULTI-TOOL,LEATHERMAN;is a great tool for everybody, really l love lt!!!. good price,faster delivery. thankyou amazon.com."
5,A fine book for stamp collecting,"This book is a little dated because it was written about 11 years ago- the statistics are old and the info about web sites info is not up to date. The suggestions about getting stamps from family and friends (Chapters 7 & 8)are no longer possible for most Americans, and the info about finding local stamp dealers is no longer valid - but just about everything else is correct and accurate. And, there are a few errors - see if you can find two mis-labeled photos of stamps in chapter 11. This book has much that is a big help to beginners and even intermediate collectors, and is written in a style that is easy to read. Very helpful and informative. After 53 years of stamp collecting, even I learned a couple new things! Well worth adding to your library, even if you have been collecting for a long time and think you know it all! Robert W. Martin, Life Member American Philatelic Society"
3,OK for the Intended Purpose,"This product works pretty well for what it was intended, which is raising-up your child so that your car's regular shoulder belt rests properly across their chest instead of cutting into their neck. For my car, it is difficult to connect the seat belt to the buckle because the buckle is too low and the seat gets in the way. Also remember that this product will never be safer than using a seat with full double shoulder straps. If your kid is too wiggly to stay in a proper seating position, stick with the full double strap models."
5,beautiful chair,"ok, first, in response to the first review....you maybe should look with your eyes at the picture in the description as you can clearly see it is a rocking chair!!!!secondly, its not so lime green, at least the one i got wasn't. its very beautiful and my son loves it. quite durable as well"
2,Crane not real. Cheap toy. Falls apart easily.,I was looking for an inexpensive construction toy for my 3 year old son. This looked like a fun play set but it is a little lame. The crane falls apart when you spin it because it does not clear the back of the set. I thought the crane would move up and down but it has plastic 'ropes' that are fixed and do not move. The ramps detach when you move it. The wrecking ball knocks down the blue shed easily but too easily for my taste. Makes for a high mom/dad maintenance requirement to reset it over and over. The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price. I expected the toy to be a little on the flimsy side since it was inexpensive I just wish the crane really worked and it held together better.
2,rough construction,I bought this for my 2 & 1/2 year old. I ended up putting it away for when he's older - like maybe 5. The site falls apart too easily and the roads don't all fit together properly.
2,Too small.....,I ordered this dress a size bigger then my normal size and it was still too small in the chest. I was very disappointed because the dress was for a cruise to the Bahamas. I ended up getting a different dress from someone else.
3,It was what I expected.,"I mainly purchased this book because of the show I watched on the Smithsonian Channel. They talked about how time consuming it was for Mr.Jefferson to cut apart 4 original Bibles and compile them into one, taking out all of what he thought wasn't necessary, mainly the religious Dogmas. It was actually more interesting watching the Smithsonian book experts unbind the entire book, and put it back together, not only to restore it, but to preserve it. I believe it took approximately one year, so I thought I should at least read the book that they felt was important enough to do what they did."
3,Good book,"The book is not what I expected, I thought it had some personal points of view or Jefferson's own opinion in some nonetheless excellent lecture. Although, feels like reading the bible"
2,Jefferson Bible from Amazon,"The book is small and was without an introduction about the selections picked by Jefferson. I would have appreciated more information about its selections, and why he included them."
5,Small but powerful,"This book is rather tiny, but perfect for carrying around. It's the New Testament, but without all of the hocus-pocus BS. It provides an excellent philosophical interpretation of the events of the NT. Open your mind and make your own decisions. You were given a brain, not a bible."
2,Nothing more than an edited Bible.,Disappointed to hear from my friend (who received this as a gift) that it's nothing more than a bible with certain parts excluded. Also chose gift wrapping and later found out it was poorly wrapped.
1,bible redaction = no truth,"this is not a bible at all. it is a redacted 'gospel according to jefferson.' it is totally devoid of any spiritual or moral value since the jesus portrayed is not divine. i do not recommend this work of fiction unless it is studied in comparison with the actual four cannonical, historically accurate gospels."
5,Views from famous writers,"If you like Bible studies and the views and thoughts of others regarding the Bible, this is an interesting book. A mere mans thoughts and ideas...Not to be substituted for the BIBLE tho!!"
4,An Enlightening Read,"The brilliant statesman who drafted the Declaration of Independence and served as America's third president boldly separated himself from the established churches of his day. Regarding Jesus as a great moral guide but not a divine figure, and believing that Jesus' message had been distorted by Christian prelates, Jefferson discarded the Old Testament and the works of Paul, and extracted from the Gospels the basic story and teachings of Jesus to compile what is called The Jefferson Bible. This new Noontide edition of a long-suppressed work is set in large type for easy reading. In an enlightening introduction, Biblical- and religious scholar Dr. Martin Larson explains the deist outlook of Jefferson and some of America's other founding fathers"
5,Great!,"Book was in excellent shape. Enlightened by information about Thomas Jefferson of which I was not previously aware. Appreciated his insights and his style of writing. Who, but he, can turn a phrase so beautifully."
5,great book,for years i had hear of this book and the smithionian magazine told about it so i just came to amazon and ordered it . smart decision!
5,book,This book arrived on time as promised. I am enjoying reading it. I am pleased with the book. I will purchase again.
4,The Jefferson Bible,"I enjoyed the 'bible', never taught this in school & I found it to be very interesting. I had no idea he had written 'his own bible' of his beliefs.Interesting!"
5,Great Item,"People mistakenly believe that Jefferson was a diest dues book. The fact is that Jefferson made teh claim throughout his life to the release of throughout his life he was a Christian. IN addition, Jefferson signed treaties with American Indians to teach them Christianity and the life of Jesus Christ. This ""bible"" was created not to replace the Bible but to lead those who read this text to draw closer to our Savior Jesus Christ with exploration of the Bible."
4,Jesus said...,"I have long believed that the way Jesus said to live was more important than his immortality (or mine). I knew our ""Founders"" didn't base our constitution on ""Judea-Christian values"", as is frequently proposed by somepolitical/religious leaders, but on principles of the Enlightenment which they believed would bring a new kind of government, free of religious oppression, first to America, and then to the world.The only books on the subject are very large, very scholarly, very informative, but... how nice to have this little book on my coffee table where curious minds can explore the thinking of one of America's most forward looking leaders, and read just the words of Jesus, without the mythology attached to his death by future theologians.The preface, the introduction and chapter about Jefferson's contemporaries is a history lesson everyAmerican should review. No-one who has visited my home has found it in any way offensive, but allfind it enlightening !"
5,Jesus Escaped the Fundamentalists!,"This work condenses the scattered faith documents that are the ""Gospels"" into a kernel of real truth. It is a truly remarkable piece of work for those of us who believe Christ is more than the charicature that many zealots paint him as today. Jefferson deduced the real message in the New Testament, which was a call to live a better, more ethical life. He saw through the amalgam of Greek mythology, cynic-style homilies, and cosmic-battle cultic material that was mish-mashed together by 2nd century apologists to create a life for a man whose very existence is debatable. Christ is a concept and a model, not a god! Jefferson indeed created a bible that can be used as a life tool, not a tool of oppression and coersion with which one can be saved or damned."
5,The Jefferson Bible,The Jefferson Bible parallels the Gospel of Thomas that was uncovered in a cave in the Middle East in the mid 50s of the past century.Both of these writings describe the fundamental instructions that Jesus promoted without the overlay of the Constantine burden.
2,Unattractive presentation,"Depending upon their theological positions, people will have different reactions to the selections Jefferson chose to include in his Bible. The words will be the same in any Jefferson Bible. However, I was very disappointed in the appearance of this version. The print was small, ugly, and strangely arranged on the page (for example, crowded up at the top of the page, with the rest of the page empty). I have seen much more beautiful presentations of the Jefferson Bible."
5,His book,"Good book for research, but by itself more a statement of the man who put it together..No matter, a worthwhile book to be in the collection of serious studiers of faith & religion (and honest faith)."
5,Jefferson's genius shines through!!,"If you want to see Jesus in his own words. You must read this. Jefferson applied reason and science to break the Gospels down to just that which is directly attributed to Jesus Christ, You'll be surprised at how much more you can learn from this book than from the Bible."
4,Book quality,"The content of this book is very good. I can't say how close it is to the original Jefferson Bible (as this is a reprint) , but I can only assume it is entirely intact.The only things keeping this from 5 stars is that the layout looks like a printed and bound ebook -- which it is -- it's got tiny clipart by the page numbers, the font is Helvetica or Verdana (kinda screams ebook to me), a few typos here and there, and it has a quote cited from Wikipedia in the preface. In the publisher's defense, it is a good quote, but...Wikipedia? Really? The quote could not be found somewhere else?I admit these issues are very small in relation to the book in its entirety. This is an excellent reading copy, but I would urge any book collector to spend the extra money and buy this book from another publisher.Bottom line: Great content, but layout could look a little more professional."
4,crib notes for people that don't want extra 1st cent jargon,"If you want to know the basics but can't or don't want to contact the clergy, this is a good reference."
4,This book is not as good as Emory's Encyclopedia of Country Living in my humble opinion but it is well worth having on the shelf,This book is not as good as Emory's Encyclopedia of Country Living in my humble opinion but it is well worth having on the shelf
1,Disappointed,I had heard about this book for many years. I ordered it hoping to have a book that was strictly about the life of Jesus. The book ends with His death on the cross. If you believe as I do that Jesus was seen and heard by his followers for a number of days after his resurrection you too will be disappointed at the abrupt ending. Very sad.
2,The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth,"I had read that Thomas Jefferson had cut various verses from the New Testament, reassembling them to form this book. Although there is a lot of controversy, I found The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth interesting."
2,I thought it would contain more commentary from TJ,I thought it would contain more commentary from TJ. All it contains is a list of random scriptures. No notes from Tom J.
4,Riveting and well written,"Little is known of feral children, yet Sherryl Jordan describes a very real scenario in this book. Tanith has our empathy from the start. What's more, the wolves also are given distinct personalities- so that they become a viable characters in this novel. A good book for introducing readers to survival in prehistoric times."
2,Oh dear,This game isn't up to standards. I enjoy some of there acting but there games are just rubbish. If you want a real game try super mario or sonic advance but this is lame.
1,There other games were a lot better!,"Don't get this game unless you're five and under!...A total waste of money! Its so confusing but then when u start dancing it is so stupid you just match the arrows with the arrows and then you dance. You can't even see how you're dancing. The Britney Spears one was a lot better! At least it replayed what you did so you could see the moves! You do nothing in this game. And then when you go to dance it does all this stuff in the backround like wavy pink lines and blue polka dots. There is nothing one there face it's just a face! No eyes no mouth, no nose! Nothing! Its so unrealistic. Don't buy it! It's not fun at all. I would've given it a zero, only the least you can give it is a one."
4,I loved this game,This game is all about girls of course. I am a huge FAN OF DANCING. And Britney Spears i have her dancing game to i don't like it as much as i love GIRLS NIGHT OUT. So go out and buy this game u will be glAD you did
5,Great CD!,My daughter has just gotten into Strawberry Shortcake movies and books so I bought her this CD to listen to in the car- she LOVES it and sings the songs all day long! Cute songs about friendship!
3,Needs more pictures,"It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, this book chose the thousand-word route in most cases. Neural nets are ideal candidates for illustrations. So, why they decided to use endless descriptions is beyond me. It is like giving directions over the phone when a map would get to the point much faster.It also needed to explain more conceptually how neural nets actually work, not just how they are arranged. Examples where the net matches one-to-one with an actual image or pattern are easy to follow, but how they recognize different variations of patterns (variety) I never got a good feel for from this book. However, the description of an Adeline node was pretty good."
4,An excellent introduction to Artificial Neural Systems,The book is a very inspiring introduction to artificial neural computing. It explains the intutive motivation behind the design of almost all major artificial neural models. It explains insight in simple english. This book along with a mathematical rigourous book can provide a very good understanding on the modern neural network research.
2,"Cheap, but cheap!","Great if you are looking for a short term, cheap product, but you get what you pay for. when ours came, it was already cracking on the folds- its that cheap plastic-like material. doesnt seem like it would last long."
3,Zipper Issues,"For me this bag really was the perfect size... not too big, not too small. It had compartments for everything I needed. Even had a removable zippered pouch. The only thing that I wish they would have done differently is the zipper into the bag. First it doesn't meet the material from end to end so when it's closed you have about an inch on each side that you can put your fingers in the bag. So when the bag is unzipped you have a terrible time getting things out of the bag since essentially the bag is wider than the zipper will open. I struggled to get the changing pad out and really struggled getting the cardboard packing out, finally had to try and fold it in half while still in the bag. I'm returning this bag as it really just won't function right with this current zipper. I'd also like to point out that it says the strap is adjustable... it isn't (that wasn't a problem but thought some folks might like to know)"
5,Great diaper bag,"This diaper bag is great, has a lot of room to put all sorts of things inside it. It's big enough to put all my personal items plus the babies things. I chose this pattern so my husband could carry it without feeling like he was carrying a woman's purse."
3,Decent Bag,I bought this diaper bag just before I had my little boy and its a fairly decent bag. It fits alot of his things (will not fit everything needed for a prolonged stay such as 10 hours at the babysitters while I work) So I do have to carry a second bag just for clothes and toys. The bag is rather attractive for a diaper bag and is insulated with dividers. My only real complaint with this bag is that its not that durable my little boy is now 6 mos. old and the bag is pretty beat up looking Im gonna have to buy another bag. When he was only 3 mos. old I began to notice the lineing on the inside of the bottle compartments had pretty bad rips in them. Now there is much more damage and were actually really easy on this diaper bag so it shouldnt be wearing and tearing the way that it has. I wish I could write a review for the small black bag the hospital gave me its holding out great and is still in brand new condition!!
5,Great item,Great item and was delivered as promised. This was a gift and the person I bought this for loved it.
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,I purchased this movie on DVD recently because I like Jami Gertz. There was some excellent acting in this movie but the overall story and language was not my cup of tea.
2,Weak,"This convoluted and tepid WWII thriller takes place in 1942 after the D-Day landings at Normandy but before the Allied breakout. There are actually multiple plots, one is by a group of German army officers seeking to blow up Hitler and install Rommel as the president of a Germany that would then come to terms with the Allies and concentrate on fighting Stalin. The main plot however, concentrates on a British spy who comes up with a workable plan for assassinating Rommel as he partakes of his weekly hunting session. Although he never gets the go-ahead, he decides to pursue the plan while on the run. Two killers are dispatched from England to stop him, and they work with the French to track him down. There are far too many players, none of whom rises beyond cardboard characterization. The ending culminates in a series of silly predictable (especially if you know how Rommel really died) ironic reversals. This book was written under a pseudonym by Clive Egleton."
3,One Great Composer Filtered Through Another,"Twenty years after the Berlin premiere of Weber's Der Freischutz, Berlioz composed recitatives for a Paris production of the tremendously popular work. He also orchestrated Weber's piano piece 'Invitation To The Dance' to function as the obligatory opera ballet. (That piece, one of the best known orchestrations ever, is inexplicably omitted from this performance.) The recitatives are examples of Berlioz' finest declamatory writing, and do relatively little damage to Weber's original work.The whole cast are excellent exemplars of ""French Style"" and the male soloists could not be better. The women are more problematic. Neither has an attractive voice, and both have problems with some coloratura passages.The sound recording is first rate, and the Wolf's Glen scene has a wonderfully creepy atmosphere."
3,Berlioz Freischutz,"I had heard the Berlioz Freischutz on the radio once upon a time, and I wanted to hear it again. This is the only recorded edition I've ever located. Nice try Berlioz.Maybe Weber should have done it this way originally. Since the whole thing is in French, it's hard to compare. I don't think it quite carries over. Oh well, Berlioz could have done this to the Ring. Yee haw!"
5,Music to Kvell By,"This is a rich collection of songs, many of which originated or were popular in the U.S., such as ""Romania, Romania"" and ""Belz."" The selections range from tragic (a ghetto lament) to madcap (a Spike Jones number), and they're perfection as performed by incredible vocalist Julie Bressler and the band."
1,bad service,"I don't know what is the quality of the ordered item. The supplier mailed to me a cheap imitation of it !Following my complaint, he (and Amazon) decided to credit my Visa w/o returning the item"
4,game is enjoyable,"This game is very enjoyable, especially for one who is new to onsoles.Its all a new experience to me.Itsa shame I didnt get into this earlier."
2,nah,Horrible rip off of contra. It looks like they didnt even try that much to make the game interesting. Another miss for Midway. The game loses it fun factor pretty quick.
5,The Leon album to have if you are only having one.,"If you are only going to have one Leon Russell album in your collection, this is the one to have. If you are going to have several, this one must be included. The songs are largely poignant, but powerfully so. Roller Derby, on the other hand, may make you laugh out loud. My Cricket is both funny and sad at the same time. All of the tracks are highly evocative. Leon's performance and composition are both brilliant. With the sole exception of Acid Annapolis, every track on this album is a winner."
3,Leon is a master - but,"This is not my favorite of Leon Russell's early albums - still, that is because not EVERY song on it is excellent. If you are just looking to add some early Leon to your collection, go with Asylum Choir II and Leon Russell and the Shelter People."
3,Feel soft but changes color,"Towels are nice and luxurious. However if you use face wash with Benzoyl Peroxide and then dry your face using the towel, the towel changes color????"
4,thought-provoking for leadership wonks,"One my most-recommended books whenever discussions about ""leadership"" or ""control"" go sideways. Flawed, but discerning readers can extract real-life applications of the models and metaphors herein. Worthy of updating and reissuing with a new market positioning that will expand its audience beyond psychoanalytical circles."
1,nauseating smell,I live in a bachelor suite and I find that the smell of food gets into my closet and into my clothes. I bought the Oust air cleaner fan to get rid of the cooking smell on my clothes (in my closet). I had to turn off the unit after a few minutes because the smell was awful. I thought Oust was supposed to get rid of odor. The citrus fragrance in the solution smells too much like one those cheap bathroom deodorizers - it's too synthetic it's nauseating. I don't really know if the Oust product actually gets rid of odor or if the strong fragrance in the solution is just MASKING the odor. Now my clothes don't smell like food but my closet smells like a heavily deodorized bathroom.
1,disappointed,this item did nothing to educate nor inform the audience of the artist Vincent VanGogh as a person nor his work
3,This Movie Wasnt as Bad as the Other Bozo Reviewers Claimed.,"It was Mediocre film with some amusing scenes and intersting cinematography of the Dutch landscape and people. The movie is a little slow at certain times so it feels a little bit uneven but Overall the Film is Not the Worst like the other reviewers claim !!! They should watch Enough w/ J-Lo cuz that Stupid film deserves No Stars !!! Ha,ha,ha.... ;)"
2,"As a lover of Van Gogh, I did not care for this movie.","Jacques Dutronc was great, it was the directing and the portrayal of Van Gogh that I thought was inaccurate. This movie is only based on the last 67 days of Van Gogh's life. Perhaps, I would have enjoyed it more if we could have watched how Van Gogh evolved. What was he like during the ten years before his death? I'd like to see a movie that can depict more of the essence of Van Gogh, and not only focus on ""the worst days of his life"". There is a huge misconception in the world, of who Van Gogh ""is"", and this movie only feeds it. Read ""Dear Theo"": Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo. The book is far much better than this movie. At least, we can get the truth through Van Gogh's eyes, not Maurice Pialat's."
1,Van Gogh,"Pure trash. Save your time and money. It does not belong in the catagory with ""Cezanne in Provence""."
4,for an experienced readership,"Edwards claims that his book is the first on using open source software to build robotic systems. The aim is to reduce the cost, as compared with using a commercial real time operating system. Hitherto, the latter has been the choice of many robotics designs.He puts a lot of detail into the text, of how to use linux as the embedded operating system in the robot. To address the issue of whether linux is up to the demands of real time running. The ideal reader should be proficient both in linux device drivers and in constructing robots. The text is probably not ideal for someone new to either field.To motivate the reader, Edwards provides several examples of functionalities to be built into the robots. Like being able to use GPS, which sounds quite neat."
2,Boring,I got this book as a gift and it is clear from the quality of the writing that it was written by the author while she was sleep deprived. I feel the bad writing did little to keep my interest in the subject matter.
5,5 stars because it exists,"I was shocked to actually locate a new burner for my six year old (obsolete) Ducane grill. Ducane was bought out by Webber several years ago but good luck getting Webber support for a product they never manufactured. This burner is the exact OEM replacement and came with new igniters. FYI, this is only half the burner. The right and left burners have different part numbers."
3,length of play a little disappointing,I got this for a teen that was really into the whole set of soul reaver games. It has some really well done movie clips but the time it took to finish the game was a little disapointing. Took about 3 days for a teen that didn't play it but off and on over a weekend.
5,Get ready...,"First off i have to say from the review i just read. Soul Reaver 2 is not a cliffhanger. Blood Omen 2 is going to be best understood by those who have been playing the Legacy Of Kain Series since Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain. Everything fits together like a puzzle once you finish Soul Reaver 2. There are still a few un-answered questions to what happened with some characters such as Ariel,(the foreshadowing from Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver when she was slain by the Soul Reaver by Raziel). If you really want to enjoy Blood Omen 2, which i know will help, Play every game in the series. Starting with Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain to see how Kain began as a vampire. Then everything will make much more sense."
1,As Ususal For Edios!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT'S A DEFINITE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and in the end it's a game controller thrown across the room. Especially when you have to beat the bosses!!This is the end of the line for eidos games for me!!!!!! If you love eidos and you play this eidos game YOU WILL NEVER WANT ONE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!Fair warning ""DON'T PLAY THIS EIDOS GAME"" just clear it from your mind.(PS,it is fun at first until you get to a boss stage that is.)"
3,blood omen 2,"in my opinion this is a good and the best vampire game, i have ever played. the story line is excellent. before starting to play i expected that blood omen 2 would be more exciting and interesting before starting to play. blood omen is the part of the legacy of kain series, which has 5 installments. recommend you to play each of the game series."
4,"Blood Omen 2, not such a bad game.","All in all this is a great game. I had this for Xbox originally, so I never had to deal with the alleged glitches. I hope I won't when I re-buy this for ps2. >< Anyways you are Kain, an arrogant, cocky vampire with a huge superiority complex. When the game starts you get your @$$ handed to you by some dude named the Sarafan Lord. Kain makes an alliance with Uma I think her name was. He goes across Norrath kills Sarafan, Hyldan, and a bunch of other things along the way. You get weapons, your weapons wear down, you throw it into the next body...repeat. The world of Nosgoth is actually beautifully done, and you could truly get lost in it. The sounds, the way people go about their business, it was a new and much needed facelift to Nosgoth. The only issue I really had with this game was that it wasnt so much a puzzle game as it was a straight hack n slash blood bath, and too many discrepencies. I'd play it though."
3,Yeah i think this is a great series!,"This is the first in the Legacy of kain i have ever played and yes i like it, this story makes me curious to play trhe others which i hear is better , i must say the glitches piss me off and the controls and actually game at times really can fustrate you. but that does not take away the essense of the game Edios have the tenency to make game with lots of errors and some horrible graphical flaws example Hitman.I will definitely play this series through this game wasn't so bad i love the story or did i mention the terrible Lip sync? ummmmmmmh oh well all in all a passible effot by Edios laters folks and gamers feast on the blod on humans ha ha ha ah!"
4,"Not as good as Soul Reaver 2,","but I really dig this game. Yeah, there a few flaws in this game, but there are far worst games out there, with a horror plot. If your a fan the Legacy of Kain seires or just a fan of gorey entertainment. Check this out. Kain is my favorite anti-hero."
2,Blood Omen 2 is one glitchy game!,"I have been a fan of the LOK series for awhile and when I heard Blood Omen 2 was being released I was happy about it.I bought the game and it is a TOTAL let down.The game has terrible problems.It has MAGOR problems from freezing up,collision detection,sound,framerate(meaning the game slows down so much it pauses or stutters)and various other problems.Save your money and don't buy this game.You will regret it.It is one of the worst games I have played in years.I have been a gamer since I was 10 and I am now 28.Trust me on this one.It's just worth a rental but don't buy it."
2,Only for fans of the series,"This game was quite hyped up since I first heard about it. But, don't believe the hype. This game has more bugs than any other game I've played on the PS2. It runs choppy every time more than 3 people are on screen at the same time. Also there are glitches during cinematic scenes which make the voices go about 2 seconds before the animation, leading towards a VERY annoying experience. Although not total trash,(especially if you have followed the series from Blood Omen) gamers who are fans of the Kain series will enjoy this game slightly. I myself have followed the series since the very first Blood Omen so the technical issues on this game are almost tolerable, however the story has many pacing problems. Not to mention that there are plot holes. I wont comment on the ending to prevent any mishaps. Fans deserve to learn the facts. But, I'd say just rent this one unless you are a LoK fanatic."
1,Disposable Cameras,"Nice features which are included because Canon saved money by using a cheap tape transport. Within very little time expect to be continually exposed to the ""Remove the Cassette"" which can, apparently, only temporarily fixed at the Canon Repair Center. It appears that the cheap transport is not model specific. Caveat Emptor"
2,Poor Quality Video and Narrative,We thought that the 2008 date meant it was a recent production. It looks like an old VHS that has been transferred to DVD. It was a dull presentation. We're donating it to the library.
4,a bomb ... streetball title for your ps2,"When I first purchased this game, I was a little skeptical about its play value. I had heard very mixed reviews and I just wanted to see what the games was like for myself. It turns out I made the right choice. This game has a solid street ""feel"" to it and all the secrets are a nice touch. I mean hey, who wouldn't want to see celebrities and real life ballers shakin' each other up and putting shame on each other. But, every game has its drawbacks. The create-a-baller system and the camera angles are just awful. This definitely needs to be worked on to keep its gamers hooked. The music was good, but gets very repetitive, its much better to just put the music on mute and just play your faorite pump up music. But, still a good game nonetheless."
1,Big Letdown,"As a lover of Street, I was very excited to hear about this game and bought it immediately. To my surprise, its not even a tenth as good. This game is five on five with only street players (i had a feeling that was coming, with no NBA endorsement on the cover) and boring backdrops. There is just too much going on on the court in order to really have fun with street style moves. I also think the arial attack could be made more interesting. It plays like a generic basketball game with the addition of ankle breaking moves, which is a big step down from NBA Street, which was more like the Arcade NBA Jam style of ballin'. I returned this game after a day, and bought Slugfest instead. At least I can punch gayrod now."
5,definately worth it,This is more than a game it comes with 3 and1 mixtapes aswell as about 4 video clips the music sets the mood and the gameplay is easy to get the hang of and once you unlock the and1 ballers you can do their special moves you can also create your own ballers and then pay for them to get better. over all this game is definately worth the buy.
4,A crummy wannabe arcade b baller.,"I'll put it plain and simple. Glitchy, boring and lame. That was all I saw in this game. Some decent music however. But other than that, it's just another clone gone bad."
1,street hoops is totally whack,"if you gonna create a game that is for the urban youth then maybe ya'll should talk to some of us before making it. street basketball is nothin like this game. the shot blockin aint realistic and the crossovers are faker than gold painted teeth. thats not even all of it, the graphics aren't that hot and the player movement is jagged. the soundtrack is iight, DMX is my dog and meth and redman are off da heezy but some recent music would have been tight. and what is up with the jay-z look alike on the game cover?"
4,A little bit of everything,"Thisa game is awesome. I was a little weary of buying it at first, but once I started playing it, I couldn't put it down. My wife isn't a big fan of it, and I get an attitude from her when I try to show her the cool videos they have of the streetballers. I love it. Unlock the videos on the game, and sit back and enjoy some talented basketball players. People compare it to NBA Street, but I think these are two different games. NBA Street is a little too ""cartoony"" for my taste. The only drawback on Street Hoops, is the announcers. I just turn them off."
3,fun if slightly forgettable,"After reading some harsh reviews of this game I expected the worst, however, I can honestly say Street Hoops is actually pretty decent. Even fun at times.While it won't win any awards for depth or simulation, Hoops is a quick game to get into and provides a solid challenge. This is ""urban"" b-ball, complete with attitude, rap music, and street fashion. At least this is Activision's version of ghetto ballin', so take it all in stride.I found myself turning off the annoying announcer and the trash talking, as both of these become played out in a matter of 2 or 3 games. Probably more like 1 game, first half.The action/graphics look good, and the dunks are phat as well.All in all this game is decent."
2,Good intentions with bad graphics,"The graphics weren't the best. It didn't measure to the original street hoops, ""NBA Street."" The players were too small to enjoy the fancy moves they did on the court."
5,A beautifully illustrated immigrant story,"""Oranges on Golden Mountain"" is an excellent children's book. The text by Elizabeth Partridge is complemented by Aki Sogabe's colorful illustrations.""Oranges"" tells the story of Jo Lee, a Chinese boy who emigrates to California, where he works as a fisherman with his uncle. He misses his mother, who is still in China, but he plants orange branches that she gave him to take on his journey.This is a realistic immigrant story with some fantastic/supernatural touches that evoke traditional Chinese beliefs. Illustrator Aki Sogabe creates many memorable scenes: a letter writer engaged in Chinese calligraphy, the Dragon King flying over a stormy ocean, Jo Lee tending his orange saplings, and more. To sum up: this is an excellent book for children of all cultures."
4,The Grasshopper Trap,Only McManus has the wit to create the Grasshopper Trap. He is great author as well as a University Prof. (Eastern WA Univ.) THE GRASSHOPPER TRAP
3,Too much of the same thing,I love everything P. McManus has ever written. The problem I have is that all three of these books have identical content. The covers are different but they all contain the same stories.
1,AWFUL!,"Simply put...it is a very bad film even for first time director! Made no sense, made not one point, no rhyme or reason!"
3,Fun toy but difficult to ride,"My son loves this fire engine! He likes to play with the bell and the horn, but it is difficult for a parent to push due to the turning radius. It's hard to steer, and barely able to push it in a straight path. This toy is fun, but hard work for the parent and child."
2,"Very cute, but very hard to steer","This is an adorable lil' fire engine, and my twin sons love the look of the toy, and enjoy playing with the bell and the horn. But it is also VERY heavy, awkward and has very little in the way of turning radius. The steering wheel just barely turns left and right. This frusterates them more often than not, which is why I rate the toy only a 2 for fun."
1,The paint wears off quickly!,"This is a cute little fire engine. However, we have been very disapointed because the paint wore off after just 1-2 months! It is so faded that someone asked us if it was an antique!!"
4,"Average sound and vision, peerless performer.","There is no question that the sound and vision on this DVD release is below average. ""Two Against Nature"" it ain't. However, if, like me, you regard Bruce Hornsby as one of the finest composers and performers in any idiom of the past 25 years, you will enjoy this DVD for what it is: a record of a great band at the peak of its powers. The concert was recorded in Koln, Germany sometime after the release of ""A Night on the Town"". The majority of the songs are taken from that recording. Koln, of course, was the setting for a famous Keith Jarrett release on ECM. Horsnby dedicates ""Another Day"" to Leon Russell. And that about sums things up: a cross between ""Leon Live"" and ""The Sun Bear Concerts"", with a dash of bluegrass and country for good measure. Forget the audio quality (which is tolerable rather than execrable) and enjoy 90 minutes of superb music, beautifully crafted and flawlessly played."
2,horrible quality,"I can't believe they released this on DVD. I bought it at a local store, and luckily was able to return it.The only person who would really like this is a HardCore Hornsby fan who is obsessed and needs to own everything he/she can that is Hornsby related.Mainly, it's the sound quality. There are times where it actually fades out, like you're listening to an old beat up cassette that is on it's last legs.The picture quality isn't any better. It was very poorly filmed and recorded.Musically, it is a decent performance for the most part, although early in the group's history. I've heard them play much better. Maybe I was just too distracted by the quality to really enjoy it.I'm sorry."
2,Sound quality is mostly terrible,"For a concert DVD, I can accept average video, but the audio still has to be listenable. I watched this with headphones on and it gets painful on many of the songs - it sounds like someone left the master tape sitting in the rain before they transfered this to DVD. It fluctuates so bad at times you can't even hear much of anything."
3,fluency in Latin required,The author has several Latin words and phrases per page. There is a concordance but it contains a very small fraction of the Latin words used. I tried entering some of the Latin terms on google but there were no definitions found.
2,Price beats quality... Glad I have a 2 year old!,"I received the item I ordered yesterday along with another item from the same seller; both came in the same package. One item was in good shape, the other wasn't. It looked as though the packaging for the Disney Pixar Cars Diecast ""Ramone"" had sustained some water damage at some point. From a collectors stand point it would completely devalue it, but lucky for me I have a 2 year old that loves Disney's Cars. At the great price of $2.99 I decided I would just open it and let my son play with it rather than send it back."
5,Excellent History on Video!,"Excellent video sourch of the recent discovery and evaluation of the Romanov Family remains found in Russia. Gives accurate information on the grisly murders of both the family and their mentor, Grigorii Rasputin. Also investigates the recent DNA testing of the remains as well as the DNA testing of Anna Anderson. With beautiful photography of the actual sites, interviews with current experts, and step by step explanations, this video is a must-see for all interested in this turbulent time in Russian History."
3,"Good Video, but..","This is a good video, but.. it was wrote by Peter Kurth a huge Anna Anderson suporter & this video gives this slant, despite the medical evedence that she was not Anastasia. Plus the ""western"" view that Anastasia is one of the missing is also not true, Maria is the missing body. From Yurovsky`s report: "" Here we discovered that Tatiana, Olga and Anastasia were wearing some kind of special corset."""
3,Perfectly tolerable post-series DS9 offering.,"Fine action, good suspense, good (but not great) characterization, nothing much deeper than that, and the book suffers from being a middle book in a couple of different ongoing sequences, so if you haven't kept up with ALL of the preceding ""Trek"" books, you'll be coming in in mid-plot on several subplots. Nothing that can't be pieced together with a bit of general Star Trek background and a bit of intuition or insight, and if one really WANTS to read this as a stand-alone, it isn't impossible to simply assume that there are things going on in the backstory that we aren't told (although, lacking an ending, it definitely can't be read as a true stand-alone unless one doesn't mind not finding out what happens to the major character, but that was a danger coming in; this entire series is like that.)"
4,Another good post-Sisko DS9 story,"I really liked this book. I agree with some that it seems fragmented, but that can be a good change of pace. I often like well done stories that cover a series of sub-plots simultaneously. This is one.Be forewarned. You must get a hardback book 7 (at least at this time)in order to know how things turn out. The plot is left very much hanging. (See my review of One Small Step for my feelings on that.) Apparently, the first 6 books of the series don't interact much, but the seventh apparently concludes them all (haven't gotten that one yet). There is some continuation of DS9 plot lines, especially concerning Shar. Not much about Jake."
4,a classic album,This is an album that should straddle the market - jazz lovers for the sympathetic playing of Oscar P and the band; but also for any Fred Astaire fans. No; he doesn't have the best quality voice - but - he has an astonishing feel and his timing & phrasing is beyond critisism.
4,Steppin Out Astaire Sings,Love those old movies. I was watching Holiday INN over Christmas and thought I would like to have an Astaire CD.
2,"Not the ""movies"" Fred","This is Fred Astaire, with hired studio musicians, doing songs from his movies. He's not a great singer, but such a great consummate performer, that in his movies, he brings across these songs perfectly, because the moment calls for it, and he's too great a performer not to deliver at the highest level.But here, he's just singing the songs for fun. He obviously likes the songs, and had the money and/or influence to make this collection, but it lacks the charm of the movie performances.Still, he's a pro, and so is the band, so it's a professional effort. But it lacks the old Fred Astaire magic.Bottom line, if you're looking for the movie versions, you'll be disappointed."
1,Is there something wrong with me?,"I am amazed at all these positive reviews. True the songs are great and the arrangements terrific, but Astaire is speaking these songs half the time, as if his voice had gone. And the acoustic is such that he sounds as if he was recorded separately and added on to the band. Can someone tell me what I am missing and why I am the only one disappointed before I toss this in the trash??"
5,GREAT! BUY IT!,"Both recorded in 1952, this Astaire album is similar to Fascinating Rhythm, but has slightly better sound, although a few less songs. It's digitally remastered, so quality is great. If you like Fred, you'll LOVE this! With Oscar Peterson and his musicians, the jazz arrangements are terrific. It has a very intimate feel and laid-back tempo, and it seems as if Fred is singing just to ""you."""
3,Quite good - for a Xerox,"A decent reference given as a photocopied handout to new entertainers at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival. (At least it was during the mid-90's - don't know if they still use it.) If it's the same as mine, however, ""Unknown Binding"" means ""staples"" - might want to be aware of that before purchasing."
5,Outstanding everyone should read,"One of the most outstanding books I have ever read, besides the HOLY BIBLE. Frankel speaks from true feelings and expertise."
4,Must read,Viktor Frankl has given a indepth knowledge on the needs of man and the what makes every human being to aspire to survive
3,Not one of my favorite but worth a quick read.,"I was anticipating this read so much that when I finally started reading it, it was a slow and drawn out first section of the book. There are basically two parts to the book: one is Viktor's experience in the Nazi camps and the other is his examination of the effects on him and others he observed. The first part of the book is what ""killed"" it for me. Too much detail and just too long for what he's trying to get to. The second part of the book is much better, but not what I thought it would be. Overall, this book is highly raved about by speakers, leaders, etc but I think it's just because the overall them of the book, not because the book is so great."
3,Man's Search for Meaning,"First half of the book was good. The historical aspects of it were fascinating. The book is worth the price just for that. I know a lot of people get into the second half of the book, but I did not. It was too philosophical and long winded for me. The concepts that were being presented could have been done in a few pages. In fact, I really like the overview of the book at the book's beginning."
3,Man's Search for meaning,"Very interesting book. I didn't know it was about a doctor's view of concentration camps. It was sad but I totally get his point of view on turning suffering into a purpose to survive. I don't agree with other aspects of the book. I am a very spiritually orientated person and I think the meaning of life has more to do with realizing who we really are and what we came to Earth to learn. But I did enjoy the book.Thank you,Silvia"
3,Interesting book,"I liked the first part of the book describing some of the author's experience in the WWII concentration camps. It would have been good if that same topic continued throughout. The textbook in the second half reminded me of my college career. Not pleasureable reading, but having the author's philosophy spoon fed with the expectation that it will be digested and accepted. In my retirement, I am not interested in scholarly philosophies, I read for curiosity and self-fulfilment."
1,Big dissapointment,"Reading this book was largely a waste of my time. Frankel does not set forth a literary experiment in an attempt to prove a hypothesis. Rather, he gives the hypothesis and then assumes the hypothesis to prove his beliefs. Frankel commits the cardinal sin of writing a persuasive work: he assumes his theory is correct instead of proving it. He never even attempts to prove it. This man needs to learn the scientific method. As a persuasive work, this volume is woefully inadequate."
4,Man's Search for Meaning,I really enjoyed this book. It was an interesting look at suffering and the human condition as it applies to the most extreme of situations to the everyday.
5,A classic,Insights from a brilliant man and his experience from time in a Nazi concentration camp. Tying together his professional psychology background and the struggle for survival in the most brutal of circumstances.
4,Hope in Suffering,"Viktor Emil Frankl, eminent psychiatrist and founder of logotherapy passed away on September 1997.A sadness swept through me as I heard of his death. ""Man's Search for Meaning"" was the very first book of his that I read, and along with many others who have read this best-seller I have been comforted with his simple but sagely advise: ""[E]ven the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph.""Dr. Frankl shall be remembered as one who gave humanity the courage to go through life's tumult and to endure suffering with dignity."
5,Inspired,"Simply one of the most inspiring books I've ever read since his philosophy comes out of true experience and suffering. A beautiful story, in the very least."
4,Serious thinking required.,"Mr. Frankl found a new reason for bearing suffering and injustice with courage, and has earned serious attention from philosophers for that reason, His book is thought-provoking, and worth the time to read it."
5,Amazing.,Needing inspiration: it's here. Wayne Dyer suggested it on one of his shows. Victor Frankl: MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT. Always keep it to listen to it again and again.
5,How can you not like this?,"The guy went through hell and came out without the inherent bitterness. He made choices that we would be wise to make today. History repeats itself if you forget what the history was. Ah, a prophet in me."
5,Meaning in suffering,The very best book I have read about the holocaust. I enjoyed it much more than Night. It is amazing that Frankl could be objective about his suffering and that it helped him to deal with the trauma while he was in it. Optimism saved his llfe.
5,This is a MUST READ,"The message from this book is beautiful. No matter what trials we must go through, no matter how we are treated, we choose how we will respond."
5,Man's Search for Mean,"I found this book to be an interesting read. Although it was written some time ago, it's very moving and is applicable to today's world."
5,Found my meaning,"This book helped me to find my meaning or I should say my purpose of living. It's an awesome account of what concentration camp prisoners had to deal with but not solely geared toward that alone.There are comparisons on their life and a average person's life in which one can relate to his and the other, experiences.For the price even if you don't find anything you like about it, it wouldn't be something you regret but that's up to your discretion. I think it was a awesome book and I have referred some of my friends to it already."
5,review of Man's Search for Meaning by V. Frankel,"One of the most significant books I have ever read. Not only was it interesting from the viewpoint of his story of life in a concentration cam, but also in the way he shared his views on the lessons taught by his experience. These lessons are able to be applied immediately in one's life with success. I only wish that I had read it as a young man intead of at this advanced age. The lessons to be learned are immdiately applicable to one and all. Reading this short book carefully is a life changer."
2,Not What I thought,"It was a little too esoteric for me, high on philosophy and not enough down to earth summary or thoughts."
4,Interesting and insightful book!,"Father was a WWII POW, such books by Frankl interest me. My Father was a good man and Christian to the core based on what he experienced through war and captivity."
4,Good book,"Needs to be read twice, particularly the second part of the book. the concept is really good and explained in a lucid way."
5,"A hero, a survivor and the real truth",What can you say about a man who is a legend. His book is deep and profound at a level I hope few people ever have to experience. Don't say you never knew. Read this book!
5,Thanks Atara,I read Lester Tenny's book. My hitch in hell then noticed that your grandfather and Lester lived similar lives during the same war. Lester was captured in the phillipines and your grandfather in Germany. But the best thing is that they both decided for themselves to live to tell their story. They never gave up. Thank you. I now empathize fully with the holocaust survivors in my shul when I was growing up.
3,Wrong Edition,"I was certainly pleased with the promptness of the shipment, however I was disappointed when I opened the box to see that the wrong edition had been sent to me."
3,Great Psychological Account of WWII,"My husband really enjoyed this book, I wasn't that thrilled with it. I did like the psychological background given as well as the obsrvations made; however, I wasn't thrilled with the format of the book. It truly is a manuscript not a chapter book. I really didn't learn much about the concentration camps that I didn't already know but Frankl's attitude during this torturous was amazing."
5,author richard rhodes says-,"""victor frankl manages to communicate, with the fewest words possible and no matter our life situation, why life is worth living""."
4,Great book,I have read this book (but in translation to Thai language). This is a good book which can show you the way of how you should think and handle with your life. Writer's experience is so valueable and it's the good oppurtunity for us to know a part of this special man
4,Interesting,This book is more than a simple retelling of what happened in the concentration camps. It examines our behavior in times of extreme stress.
4,"Inspiration from the inside, outwards.","An understated revelation into the compelling search for meaning to life, which Frankl believes lies within the meaning we find in our suffering. His case is very persuasive. I was changed by the book. While a Jew from concentration camps, he sometimes borrows Christian imagery to make his point, and his message is ultimately and purposefully universal. This is not merely a work for Jews in search of their history, but also for people in search of their sleeping souls. I highly recommend it."
3,AP psych review,"Man's Search for Meaning is a tantalizing book. Victor E. Frankl wrote the novel after his experience in a concentration camp where he tested and created his psychotheraputic theories. It was a short reader, not even 600 pages and while the first half was somewhat disturbing, it being about his exerience in the camp, but the second half is a little slow, it becomes monotonous and a little dull because it is about his development of Logotherapy. This book is good for the intellectual type but I do not suggest that any tom, dick or sue just pick it up to curl up with at the window seat on a rainy saturday. Thats just about it, nothing that exciting but what are you gunna do its about the haulocaust...."
1,couldn't bear it,"I am a widow, and this book was recommended to me by a psychologist to help lift my spirits. I'm sorry, but I'm not sure how page after page of descriptions of life under the nazis is supposed to help anyone with anything. I was already aware that many people have had to go through even worse things than watching a beloved spouse die of cancer, awful as that is. Certainly Mr. Frankel's experience and response to it is a tribute to the human spirit -- proof that we are more resillient than we think. But uplifting? No, I don't think so. Depressing, with no new information, is my synopsis. More power to those who can comfort themselves with some ""meaning"" in suffering and get something out of this book. But if you don't, you won't be the only one."
4,Get a hard copy,"If you are intrigued by human nature this is a book for you. If you need a change in perspective this is a book for you. If you feel like a victim, this is the book for you. If you are in recovery for PTSD, Substance abuse, or just plain flat in life, this is a book for you."
4,Awesome stuff............,What's there to say ....... ought to be required reading in every school (if it isn't already).
4,life lived with sincerity,"This is a very powerful book both spiritually and intellectually. I read it more than 20 years ago and but when re read it ths time, it still moves and inspires me to live life diligently to my fullest capacity."
4,Inspiring,I read it for inspiration as much as for wisdom. It is hard to image the horrors he must have faced in the concentration camps and the loss of his family. The fact he could come out of it with such vision and ability to inspire and help others is amazing.
5,A must for every human being,"Most people have suffered to some degree, either in the past or they will most likely experience something undesirable in the future. A book like this could literally be a life-safer and improve your life for absolute better.I cannot believe it took so many years before I discovered such an fantastic book regarding self-improvement and how to overcome tragic events in such a helpful way like presented in the book."
5,awesome book!,"One of the most inspiring, moving, tragic books a person can read. A mixture of feel good, social psychology and torture. Leaves you with key life lessons and teachings."
3,Looking for the meaning of life? You won't find it here.,"More of a personal account of the author's terrible experience as a victim of the Holocaust than a blueprint for living, this popular book is still worth reading.But if you are in a ""search for meaning"", you won't find it here. To be fair, Frankl never sets out to answer the question, and in fact proposes that each individual must answer it on their own, for themselves.Frankl's position seems to be very similar to those of people like Albert Camus: that despite man's incessant search, there is no inherent meaning in life. Frankl differs in his response to this reality from people like Camus in that his solution to the meaninglessness of life is to create meaning on our own, based on our own interests and experiences. For Frankl this meant identifying with human suffering and helping others to find individual meaning. For me at least, it's hardly enough.Of course there are no easy answers, and that is precisely the point."
3,MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING,Quite an experience but the book is too centered in the psychological aspects---more atuned for psychologists than for the general readership
5,This book's message stays with you!,"This powerful book about a personal experience dealing with Nazis goes well beyond the stories of Corrie Ten Boom or Anne Frank. It is a book people want to reread several times. As a matter of fact, our local library cannot keep enough copies of the book because patrons check them out and won't return them!"
5,Man's Search for Meaning,It realy had me thinking. What makes people act the way they do in hard times. This man lived it and took notes.
5,Man's Search for Meaning,"I applaud the author in his efforts to give meaning to life and the Holocaust. Anyone who has suffered anything, or feeling that there life is not meaningful enough, should read this book and give meaning to their suffering in writing."
5,What's the meaning of life?,"Moving, thoughtful, and persuasive argument for having a life purpose told through firsthand accounts of life in Nazi death camps.--Richard Brodie, author, Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Mem"
4,Insight into search for meaning,This book is cited often by diverse authors providing life guidance on building a purposeful life filled with meaning. I wanted to read the original myself to see what the fuss was about. There is much here.
4,A good book to read if you are and don't know why.,Very interesting book for anyone who suffers and cannot find any meaning from it. Victor Frankel survived the concentration camps of the Holocaust during World War II. If anybody knows about suffering it would be Frankel. This is an about Christianity or Judaism... it's about believing that there is value in suffering and that nobody can take away your ability to decide how you will think about things in your life. Only you control your own thoughts. This is of course not for children.
5,A book that can help you lifelong,"This is the first book I read that can offer ordinary people with extraordinary power to overcome unimaginable difficulties. If one is equipped with such power, he becomes invincible. Such power is not money, ranks, social status, and etc. Instead, it is ""man's deepest desire to search for meaning and purpose"". That desire will not only shape how one will lead his life, but also make all troubles around him less upsetting compared to the meaning of life. Most of all, he is happy no matter what happens."
5,"Viktor Frankl's, ""Man's Search for Meaning.""",One of the great books of the 20th Century. Frankel as a philospher and psychologist is to be admired for his legacy to mankind. A must read for any serious thinker.
3,"OK, but there are others I have read better.","My priest recommended this book in a grieving session I was attending. I read most of it, but never finished because it was too technical in the latter part of the book for me. The priest thought it was a terrific book, so it would depend on your view."
2,Man's Search for Meaning,"The first part of the book was well-written, poignant and interesting. However the second part was pendantic and thus boring. The author would have been better served if he used the examples in the first part of the book to sparingly illustrate the philosophy and theory in the second part of the book."
5,Good Job,Thank so much for your quick response in sending my book. The book is in excellent condition and I would not hesitate in using your services again.
5,Great Service!!,"The book was exactly as the description described and the delivery was fast, I would order from this seller again."
5,Meaning Is My Responsibility,"Out of the worst of contexts, Viktor Frankl speaks the wisdom of how to live within suffering and find meaning. Staying present to the reality of what is happening right now and finding a glimmer of something that calls us forward seem to be the keys. Dwelling only on what has been lost or is being lost leads to meaninglessness and to a despair. This lose of all hope was certain death in the camps. Reading this book again continues to inspire me to manage my suffering in a way which gives my life meaning and purpose. I highly recommend this book for anyone for whom suffering is an issue."
5,GREAT book!,"This is an excellent book, for anyone trying to discover their purpose in life. This is a book worth reading over and over again."
5,Notes from a journey....,"What if, someone asks, life in of itself has no meaning? And what if there were nothing, no savior, no relief, no narcotic or dream--nothing--! to keep us from falling into life's absurdities, crazinesses, meaninglessneses...Would it still be worth living to its fullest? Frankl says of course it is, if we could just keep our hearts hopeful. (My interpretation is, ""Things'll be better, if I can make it to Thursday"".) Do you see? In spite of the philosophical/scientific lingo on his chapters on logotherapy and the fact that perhaps we'll never be in such dire circumstances as he experienced at the concentration camps, Frankl is telling us, if anything, life is worth living because of all the good things and good people that are here around us and that we can find...even during genocide or war or personal trauma. The Meaning is clear when you reach to find it. But you must reach."
5,You'll see new meaning to life when you read this book.,"Everyone needs to read this book! When you read how decisions of whether to eat a whole slice of bread at one time, or prolong it - howyour major concern is whether your shoe laces will last all winter or not, you can appreciate more your life.--A book you'll never forget!"
5,Man's Search for Meaning - Viktor L. Frankl,"Amazing book, gives the reader many things to comtemplate. The reader will be a better person for reading this book. Written by one of the most important people of his era. Viktor Frankl is someone everyone should meet through this works."
5,A book for anyone who wants to reflect on life,"I read this book while I was in high school and it touched me so much, I still enjoy rereading it today. Granted, I only read the first section, so I cannot speak for the second half on ""logotherapy"", but I can say this book ranks as one of my all time favorites. It is touching and it makes you really think about your life and what brings you happiness and meaning. Anyone can read this book, regardless of age or background. Obviously, when I was younger, I did not completely comprehend the finer points of ""logotherapy"", but I still found this book fulfilling because it really made me think. The holocost does play a role in this book, but even if you shy away from history books or books about an individual's suffering, you should still read it. It gets you to think more about your life than his and it opens your mind to thinking about everything just a little differently. And I always think that's a good thing."
3,The Meaning of Logotherapy,"This book was really two books in one. The first part centered on the author's experiences and feelings of suffering as a Holocaust survivor. The terrible pain and indignity came out crystal clear. The second part was less than clear however. Logotherapy was difficult to grasp. Indeed, the author totally lost this reader as to the utility of logotherapy in my life and I would venture to guess that he had the same effect on other readers."
3,Not as described,Product was described as no markings in the book. It has markings and the binding is broken with pages coming out of the book.
3,Kinda basic but interesting.,The first half of this book is the authors struggles held in a Nazi prison camp during the second world war. No matter how many times we here these stories they still hit you hard. But to survive the atrocities commited in these situations takes a mental attitude of the most extreme strength.The second half of this book is a term called logotherapy. The Doctor decribes this as how are thought patterns can make us or break us in intense situations. How some prisoners lost all hope and eventually died or got sick. And how some just continued to hope and made it. It tries to describe the meaning of life that man is always asking himself. The doctor actually says that the meaning of life is the meaning that you give it in any certain situations. I like that philosophy. Other than that the basic concept I got from it is you think your way to happiness or gloom.
3,My review,"I think Frankl is a excellent writer and therapist. He makes several valid points about how man should go about finding meaning in his life. I especially like how he presented the Meaning of Suffering to the depressed doctor with the analogy of what if the wife died first? Essentially saying that the husband is saving the wife from having to suffer his death by the husband suffering the death of his wife. It is a justified way of looking at suffering. Logotherapy is all about finding meaning in life and the book explains just that but only after a very long, depressing section on his stay at Auschwitz. Although this section is somewhat dry, it is necessary to understnad where he gets his point of view for the remainder of the book."
2,Man's Search For Meaning,"I am not one who reads as much as many of you. My time is spent mostly ""doing"", as opposed to reading about doing. That said, I selected this book to read as one that I thought would be useful and enlightening. While it did provide some insights to the inner workings of the mind, it fell short of my expectations.To me, the content did not represent that which was implied by the title. Furthermore, the first half of the book relating to the authors experiences in a concentration camp, was severely disconnected with the second part of the book, which was basically, a self help phychoanalysis book. Both parts were interesting to a degree, but I did not think that they complimented each other. Like I said, disjointed at best.I know one reviewer stated that this is the best book he has in his entire (and massive) book collection. I'm sorry but, that's sad.Just one man's opinion....."
4,"Very good condition for ""used"" book",Book arrived promptly. Does not look like it was ever read. Good price for the book. I have an early copy I did not want to part with. Price was 60 cents so I bought this one to give to a friend. Told it was used they were very happy.
4,Great inspiration read!,The meaning for your life can only make living better! Frankl's story of survival is inspiring for the psyche. Find your meaning to live.
4,Insightful reading into nature of humanity,"This book provides an explanation for suffering and its fruitfulness contrary to contemporary paradigm of escapism. It demonstrates how interpersonal relations can 'make' or 'break' a person in extreme situations. Frankl's experiences and his practise of logotherapy provides motivation to fight for survival and healing on all human levels - the physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual."
3,Mans Search for Meaning,"This book on tape was a great review of the psychology of man. As the book deals with issues, philosophies, theories, and hypothesis's I found myself reviewing what makes me tick. I listened to this with my wife and the book generates live discussions, which could lead to revelations."
4,Circumstances don't give life meaning,"Francl seeks to demonstrate that, contrary to our natural inclinations, man finds true meaning in life by not focusing on self. While it is my personal belief that this is especially true in relationship to God, Francl demonstrates that it applies not only to the spiritual, but to every aspect of living. Even in the unimaginable conditions common in the German concentration camps of world war II, people survived by focusing on the needs of others or doing some greater good. Fascinating and thoughtful reading."
4,This book was recommended by a very good friend.,"After the glowing recommendation I received on this book I was expecting more. Maybe I should have read this 20 years ago and I would have had a different slant, but I have grown weary of listening to victims believing that by surviving the ordeal and then telling the story that they are somehow making up for the less than human behavior they exhibited. The holocaust was inexcusable. I just didn't feel like I learned anything new from this book."
4,Inspiring and moving,"I found this book to be deeply moving. The first section where he describes his time in a concentration camp and the ways that he and his fellow inmates attempted to cope with the terrible conditions , is extremely good. It is well written and though maybe not quite in the class of Primo Levi it is still one of the best biographical works on this subject that I have read. It is extremely inspiring.The second section of the book mainly describes his ""logotherapy"" theory. It is very interesting and I can see that many people would get a lot out of it but I was not entirely convinced by it. Finding your own personal meaning to life is probably extremely beneficial to you but I don't think that you can entirely prove or even disprove that there is an ultimate meaning to life.Despite this small reservation I thoroughly recommend this book."
5,A Classic,The message in this book is timeless. Nearly every page offers a profound quote to use as a personal motto for life.
5,Brilliant read,"This is one of my favorites. Someone lent it to me, and me not knowing what it was about at the time, I read it on the train ride to visit Auschwitz in Poland while I was touring Europe. Quite a coincidence there!"
4,Understanding coping abilities,A worthwhile read. I have wanted to read something from this author and was not disappointed. He made interesting observations regarding man's coping ability in perverse situations.
4,Man is a vessel to others he is for the good.,"A man is for the good of others if he has dignity.The stars were chosen for there purpose to dream, hope, and see beyond our own eyes. To show others that together we can reach our goals.Here was a man that could see far beyond his years. He taught those who would listen that the world is full of pain and discouragement. But if one was willing to climb to a higher rung in the ladder we too can see father than on the ground. It sometimes takes more than our own courage."
5,The Best!,"An outstanding recording. Torme at his swinging best. Amazing brass section. 12 exceptional tracks with ""Blue and Sentimental"" ""I'm Gonna' Go Fishin'"" ""Down for Double"" and ""Sent For You Yesterday"" leading the pack. Oddly enough, most of the Ellington ""hits"" are not on this CD. It should have been a double set. This album has been playing on my Ipod for weeks! Great stuff!"
4,WONDERFUL CD,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CD TO THOSE WHO LOVE SALSA AND MERENGUE. IF YOU ARE JUST LEARNING HOW TO DANCE THSI TYPE OF MUSIC THIS IS THE RIGHT CD TO USE. THE ENTIRE CD IS GOOD BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC YOU SHOULD BOTHER HEARING FOR THE FIRST TIME. TRY IT OUT IT IS THE PERFECT CD WITH SALSA AND MERENGUE MUSIC.
4,macabre enjoyment...,"what a simply brilliant game, all the controlsare perfect, all the areas beatifully designed,all the voice actors excellent (a rarity), theonly reason i give this game 4 instead of 5 starsis that it has almost no replayability... itsthe identical set of circumstances again.. imanaged to replay it once, there are parts thatyou just Have to see again , for example, TheEternal Prison... my final word is, if your afan of the series Buy This Game. If your not, orif your new to the series rent it.it took me probably 40 hours to finish it withalot of playing around."
2,I HOPE IT GETS BETTER,"I first want to say that I love a good chalange . I also want to say that I was a big fan of Soul Reaver 1 . But I like my games to be (FUN!!!!!!!!!) NOT FRUSTRATING!!!)I was having fun playing this game until I got to the first boss Vampire (FAUSTUS). This boss has an energy bar that is about ten times larger that yours , He blocks every blow you throw at him, Many of his blows you can`t block and some will drop you in about two hits!You are lucky if you get in two or three hits!! I have fought FAUSTUS about thirty times and still have yet to beat him ! the control is part of it . It is rather clunky. This will be my LAST Eidos game . They all seem to be like this (frustrating). I may take this game back or trade it for store credit. I think HALO really spoiled me!! Parts of HALO can be rather hard to get through but it is still fun! Thats what playing games is all about, Right? The game should not make you want to pull the disc out and smash it!"
5,Great story and gameplay,"This game is probably the best of the Legacy of Kain series, and to me, it is. It has a great story that you will want to play further to learn more about it. It has good graphics for the Xbox, but nothing really special. As you progress through the game beating bosses you get new powers from them after they are defeated. Speaking of bosses, this game has great boss battles. Each one makes you think about how you must defeat them, it is never by just hitting them over and over. It is not a scary game because you are the bad guy, and that's what makes it so cool. You dont run away from anyone, they run away from YOU. As I am sure you have probably heard this is not a good game for young kids or for the faint of heart. I'd say it is OK for a 13 year old, but thats bup to parents. The puzzles in the game are nothing special, but they are in there so you dont get bored with just going around killing people. I'd say this is a must own for the of age Xbox owner."
2,Terrible addition to the franchise,"I started the SR series with Legacy of Kain (SR2). I was sadly disappointed in Blood Omen 2, which has none of the ingenuity or artistry of the SR series. So I settled in for an action game, and was disappointed in the fighting engine (very tricky, and often results in your character getting killed from behind). Halfway through the game, emphasis seems to switch from action to lever-pulling, as you have a series of nonsensical puzzles to solve. Definitely the most depressing part of the game is the cut-scenes. Everyone in the game talks like they're fresh out of a vampire soap opera (kind of like an Anne Rice rip-off but without the sex). Plus, if your character gets killed after listening to a 3-minute dialogue segment, you have to watch the whole thing over again. And again. And again, until you get to the next save point. Very frustrating. I would NOT reccommend this game."
2,Boring,"Having never played a horror game I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunatley, I was disappointed. The gameplay soon became very boring as the only type of action is to run around drinking the blood of unsuspecting townfolk. Interspersed along the way is the occassional bad guy, treasure chest (I have no clue as to what benefit it gives) and the requirement of having to find a switch at different points in order to open gates. I found the controls to be slow and clumsy and the graphics are so-so. I guess I just expected more from an x-box game."
3,Just a Straight Port from PS2,"I expected at least slightly better graphics, or maybe a little bonus of some other kind, but I got none. I bought my X-Box because of it's superior graphics, unfortunately some developers just are not taking advantage to the X-Box's superior graphics."
4,"Good song, good mixes","This is a good dance song and you should pick this up if you like ANY kind of dance music or like Kristine W. The guys of the Murk production team seem to have been gaining in popularity. I'm not too fond of the duo production team, but I was pretty impressed with their writing as well as their production. My favorite mixes are by Peter Rauhofer and Gomi. Here is the track listing for the single:(1) Peter Rauhofer Radio Edit(2) Gomi's Main Radio Edit(3) Murk Miami Mix(4) Peter Rauhofer Re-construction Mix(5) Gomi's Main MixBe sure to pick up this single, it's definitely worth your time."
2,Simply Ok!,"After reading the reviews here on Amazon.com I bought this cd but wasn't impressed much after listening to it. The remixes are in no way unique and appear too repititious. The only decent remixes of this song is perhaps the ""Murk Miami and the Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction mix."" Decent. Not great! On the contrary, Kristine W's ""Lovin You"" cd maxi single of earlier talent is a much better choice with track number four(Johnny Vicious Club Mix) probably being the best remix. Check out the sales to date here at amazon.com alone. The DJ's Hex Hector, Junior Vasquez, Richard Humpty and Johnny Vicious did outstanding work with that single. THIS WOMAN CAN TRULY SING!"
3,Nice!,"I love this game! It's fun to unlock new bikes and choose you leathers and helmet for your rider. Upgrading the bikes is very nice to say the least. For some reason, the game kind of reminds me of an older Gran Turismo..but for bikes. I like that. You get street bikes and sport bikes of varying sizes and hp. A good number of tracks are there to race on..the ones through the mountainous areas are a lot of fun. I could use some better graphics...the reason for the 3 star overall...but this is an older game after all and well worth a bargin bin price. My one real beef with this game is that there is no in-race music while you are racing. The only music is on replays. That stinks! Oh well. That aside, I highly recommend this bike game."
4,Great for my kids,"My son (4 years old) recieved a PSII for Christmas along with RS and several other games. So far he has shown little interest in the other games but can't get enough of RS. It took him a while to figure out how to stear but once he got the hang of it he was hooked. Of coarse, he always comes in last and sticks to the simplest of tracks but that doesn't bother him in the least. He loves being able to pick his own bike, gear and helmet and reacing against his dad. His only complaint is he cannot figure out how to make the bike go faster."
2,DONT BUY THIS,this is one of the worst bike racing games i have played.remeber RoadRash for the genesis i would rather play that. i road race my R6 and i play the heck out of my ps2. this game doesnt do credit to either one. i played RS for all of 4 hours and took it back. i hope this review will save you 50 bucks
5,Wonderful Traditional Jazz,"Like the other CDs from these two, this is a gem. Guy Van Duser is a master guitarist, with no limit to his technique. He doesn't let that technique take over, though. His playing is heartfelt and always swinging. Billy Novick is a master clarinetist/saxophonist as well. Together, they manage to infuse the older songs with a thoroughly modern sense of style and swing. The only detraction is the singing of Novick. It's okay, but unfortunately he isn't the singer that he is the clarinetist/saxophonist. Still, a minor quibble. This is a good CD"
3,Not at his best...,"With most of the titles VERY well known and enormous hits in their own right, it would have been difficult to improve on the original product. All songs are adapted to the typical Ray Conniff rhythm patterns and choir sound, but to my opinion a bit monotonous and without sparkle. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE Ray Conniff fan with an almost complete collection of all his music."
2,Pretentious and Forgettable,"An all star cast is featured in this oddball comedy about an actor who finds a daschund and goes through nothing but trouble in Monte Carlo when he realizes it leads to a murder, and in turn he gets entangled with other people in this so-called conspiracy. The photography is nice and there are some pretty good moments, but why do the stars shout nearly every line?"
1,DONT GET THIS,"""once upon a crime"" contained no acting, no comedy, and was very annoyoying to watch and i never wanna see it again"
4,A Good Game & Simulator!,"I have been playing Luftwaffe Commander & Microsofts Combat Flight Simulator & liked'em both.I really liked playing Luftwaffe Commander & would recommend it to others. I would also recommend a Joystick to use, the keyboard is rather difficult but if your buying a flight sim a Joystick is really the way to go anyway.I would give it 4 stars compared to 5 for MS CFS because you can do more with the MS CFS like add planes, missions & other things as add-ons to the basic game.On the whole I'm glad I got it!"
4,Great Action,I had this game and somehow missplaced it so am buying another. I like the way the game starts you out and then you have to earn your promotions. The flying was fantastic & you learn a lot about air combat & what they went thru. I did find out if you pancaked your landing when in trouble you had much better chance in surviving. Keep the wheels up and live to fight another day. Love these types of games.
2,Needs work,"I purchased and played heavily most of the flight sims available when the 486 chip was current, then laid off playing flight sims until recently. I would say the graphics on this game are better than those available for 486 computers, but the rest of the game needs work. It is impossible to pay with a keyboard and mouse only. The plane will uncontrollably bank left or right. The view from the cockpit is limited. The controls are not intuitive or similar to other flight sims. It installed ok on a Celeron computer. Until I get it sorted out, it is so far a frustrating, waste of money."
2,Chemical stink,"I bought these because the price was unbeatable and who wouldn't want to ""calm"" their child. However, I guess I am spoiled because I know what quality lavender fragrance smells like because these wipes have a disgusting chemical smell that even my baby turns his nose up at if I try to wipe his face. While they did the trick as far as cleaning, I would never buy these again because of the horrible stench."
1,Fails at its basic purpose Try another brand,"These type of toys are supposed to slide out of your hands when you grab them. However this one has a very large (about 1/2 inch) seam where the two pieces are fitted together. That seam has also shrunk so is not only is much thicker in that area than the rest of the toy but also smaller. You can sort of see the seam in the pictures (look for the smaller part). The result is the toy only slips until it hits the seam and given the resistance the seams causes, even does that poorly. I have had other brands of this toy and never noticed a seam and they work quite well (are very hard to hold), but this one is pretty much worthless. It can easily be picked up and needs to be forced to slide in your hand. I strongly recommend you try one made by another company.Reading the other reviews, several of the 5 star ones seem a little too enthusiastic and I would not believe them to be genuine."
5,BEST TOY EVER!!!!!,I love my blue wigglie! I have had it for about 2 hours and NO damage has been done. I definately recommend this toy for children. I DO NOT like the fact that you can't pick your color. This is the prettiest wigglie I have EVER HAD!!! The pearl is amazing! The blue is like an aqua color! The shipping is really fast and the packaging is great!!!
3,Futurama,"If your in the mood for a road-map of the future printed in the past this is something you might want to unfold. Resorting to a whacky, light-hearted, tone writer David Cohen sets the paces and flavours, the guiding lines and the planned improvements to the coming years, never refraining from penning his comments to vivify the words of the probable or predicted worlds."
4,I don't remember Hawaii ever being this much fun!,"I'll be honest, this is my girlfriend's book. Personally as a straight male I wouldn't be caught dead reading a book like this. But my girlfriend read it and I kept wondering what the hell she was laughing out loud about. She handed the book to me several times over the days that she was reading it and I found myself cracking up as well. Needless to say, when she was finished, I picked it up. I'm normally the ""Stephen King"" type book reader, but this book is damn funny, especially for a ""chick book"". Anyways, I'm sure the women will love this book, but if you're a guy and want some hilarious insight into the way a woman's mind can work, pick this book up. Of course this is fiction (wink, wink)."
1,This one truly is a flop,This book was really bad!! I couldn't even finish it. My advice read something by Marian Keyes or Jane Green instead.
3,The book was alright,As interesting as the book seemed it lacked the quality to match up to standard of other books I have read lately.
4,Perfect reading if your'e wearing flip-flops,"This is a fast, fun, novel that would be perfect anytime you are looking for that somewhat mindless read (vacation, sick in bed, etc). You will laugh guaranteed, and if you are of an age to have any lingering romantic memories about Davy Jones of the Monkees, you will love it."
2,Not her best work,This author has another book that was good enough to make me order this one as it is now not in book stores. Turns out she uses the same plot for both and this one must have been her learning book as not good at all. Could not get thru it even.
3,Not like the movie or TV show,"Boyington was a childhood hero of mine from the TV show. However, this narrative he writes is its best when it describes the background of his men with the squadron, and his own training days. It could benefit from a little more detail about the day-to-day operations and lightheartedness tat occasionally surfaced during the war; also, it could have described in more detail Boyington's time as a POW.This book was written several years ago, and thus could not take advantage of the WW2 fascination of late that has seen so many good books with historical support. However, given that it is the story of an American ace and hero, it can provide a useful amount of information on the real story of the Black Sheep, not as it was on screen."
2,"A classic, but not a truthful one.","Mr. Boyington wrote a great book, but to really know about his squadron, VMF-214, I suggest one to read "" Black Sheep-The Definitive Account of Marine Fighting Squadron 214"", by Bruce Gamble. The facts quoted by Boyington are often misleading, with incorrect dates or which never took place at all. Much more time is expensed talking about his life as a prisoner in Japanese camps than eith his fellow Squadron mates. Boyington was a compulsive liar and a lousy Squadron commander on the ground, and his book reflects this. It is incoherent and inconsistent from beggining to end. I don't really know how someone may think it is ""the best book on air wair in the Pacific"" ..."
2,"ok book, not enough info on things around him",I found myself rather disapointed because boyington spent most of the book describing his thoughts and fellings and life and not enough of what was going on around him. It was as if he was trying to make everyone feel sorry for him.
2,NOT A CLASSIC AT ALL !!!,"Totally obtrusive as a writer, Boyington's book is plain horrible. It really doesn't deserve the attention it got. BOyington was a real air hero ( as all the men who served in WW II ), a master in the Corsair fighter, but a poor leader to his squadron in general ( I mean the ground echelon, etc ). The book is full of lies ( intended or not, I don't know ) and almost a half of it is plain boring, in the hands of the Japanese."
5,A gripping first person account of those desperate times,"Boyington was definitely not your Tom Cruz type of pilot, he was an unorthodox risk taking, erm, a Black Sheep, which goes a long way to describe his style. In a time when so many people played it by the book, he took men destined for hard jail time and turned them into one of the most feared squadrons of the South Pacific.The book is a description of the days with his squadron, as recounted by him so expect this not a dry and exacting account written by someone in USMC public relations.This is among my favorite books of all time, and a recomended read for anyone interested in aviation, WWII, or just a great (and true) action story."
3,It was just okay,"The story itself is good, but getting through the writing is a chore. I don't know that I've ever read a book written in the 50's before this one, so I have no comparison. Either it's how they were written back then, or his personal writing style sucks. Lots of sidebars that distract you from the main story, and the time line is only loosely constant."
5,The exploits of the original bad boy,"""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" is a far cry from the ""Hollywood"" version of Pappy's exploits. Pappy holds nothing back in this tell-it-like-it-is autobiography, which covers his days as a novice flyer going into combat with the Flying Tigers, his days as C.O. of VMF-214, the infamous ""Black Sheep"", his ordeal as a guest of the Emperor, and his postwar downfall and resurrection. Remember, Pappy was a Marine first, aviator second, which means you'll find plenty of alcohol induced hell raising antics, as well as up close and personal aerial combat. SEMPER FI PAPPY!!"
5,Great ww2 aviation personality.,"Fasinating story of Gregory Boyington, one of the most colorful persons to ever fly in combat. The book is a slow starter ( but needed part of the story) & builds up quickly. From his airbattles over China to his battle to get back into the Marines & combat. He was shot down & captured & his story of his captivity I find most insightful into him as a person. Ilove the book & highly recommend it."
3,No-nonsense hero,"I bought this book because of the direct link between narrative and personal experience. The big plus is that this shows through in the detailed accounts of flying and aerial warfare. Another strength is the warts and all nature of the book.We have a flawed hero who pays dearly for others' perceptions of him, despite his accompishments and undoubted bravery.It's anachronistic, but the politically correct may gulp a few times."
4,"Good Material, Bad Editing","As a fan of Monty Python, Beyond the Fringe, and Peter Cook, I enjoyed this tape, although one wishes the sound and picture quality were better. Among other things, you get Cook cast as a mass, mass murderer in a sketch that is a combination of differant Monty Python TV sketches, you get to see John Cleese and Micheal corpsing as they do the Dead Parrot sketch, and you see Cook doing his miner monologue and later on talking to a very disinterested man who's trying to read his newspaper about subjects such as intestines. Not being a Dame Edna fan I don't particularly like ""her"" bit. But this is a minor complaint. What really annoys me is the editing. Most of the skits are truncated, as we are switched from what's going on on stage to what's happening behind the scenes. While some of the behind the scenes stuff is interesting, it interrupts the flow of the onstage comedy."
5,The Definitive Amateur Radio Callbook,"The World Standard since 1920. You can spend hours on the internet trying to find addresses for Amateur Radio Operators world wide. With this CD it finds QSL information in seconds and far exceeds the listings on the Internet. A must for DX hounds. Includes longitude & latitude, grid squares, time zone information, prefix maps, detailed QTH maps, prints address labels, and has a QSL Manager section as well. Many extras such as the DXCC list, Census, Q-Signals and much more. Highly recommended. Rod Dinkins AC6V"
1,garbage,"this device broke my flash drive. yeah it is strong, so strong that the flash drive will get stuck and you end up breaking it. DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE, i only paid 1 cent plus shipping. it wasnt even worth that."
5,Gone too soon...,"Art Porter was simply amazing. This unfortunately was his last recording, but it was in my opinion his best. It's funky, upbeat and fun. However it was thoughtful and haunting at the same time. You could almost feel what he was trying to say in each song. This CD never gets old. It's a timeless piece of music that I hope lives forever."
2,not for little kids,"My son is 18 months and LOVES Little Bear. This movie is not like the little bear episodes that he normally watches. There is a lost bear that is kind of mean at first and there are some other bad scary characters in it. My nephew, who is 3, got really scared when he saw this movie. Don't recommend."
5,charming,"another bear story but so sweet. your child will enjoy it. older type of movie for kids. fun,fun,fun. do not hesitate to buy,"
5,The Little Bear Movie--Fun to watch for children and adults,"This is truly a wonderful movie and I would recommended it to everyone with small children. The author of Little Bear passed away recently. What a loss! Everyone with small children should buy up as many of Little Bear DVD's as they can afford. The animation, color,lessons for children are wonderful. There are no evil characters in them. Bright and colorful always pleasing and interesting. A joy to sit down and watch with my little grandchildren."
5,We LOVE the Little Bear Movie!,"This is one of my children's favorite videos! It is a must have for anyone who is a Little Bear fan, young or old!"
3,Entertaining for some,I got this video so that I didn't have to deal with the louder sounds and voices such as Elmo. After watching this with my daughter I can see why she prefers Elmo at her age (she is 2). After watching it 2x it's not that interesting anymore.
5,Godd family fun and good music for the music lover,"I don't typically review these movies, but after reading the review from a parent who hated it and liked The Backyardigans (who I also love) and Lazytown (who I have lesser feelings for) better, I had to put in my two cents. The family values and messages with Little Beear are WONDERFUL! I am not going to say that things have not come up with my very literal minded 2 year old that I wish hadn't (Like making a mark on the wall for your height), but all in all the messages are good ones. Also, unlike Lazytown, which is pumped up music all the time, I can listen to Little Bear in the background and NOT get a headache. I would Highly recommend this movie to anyone and suggest to that other parent that they take a music appreciation course."
5,"Explore Family, Friendship and Diversity","Light and fun, this feature contrasts Little Bear's domesticated lifestyle with the lifestyle of a wild bear, encouraging the acceptance of diversity. Characters are considerate, calm and relaxed. Love and respect between family members is exemplary. Children found it funny and good. ""It's so good I can't stop watching it!"" ""I liked seeing everyone sleeping in Cub's den and Duck was all spread out over Poppy and Pete."" ""Can we go camping with our families?"" Best for ages 2 to 5."
4,Little bear movie - very cute!,This movie is adorable. My youngest daughter loves it! She watches it at least twice a week!! I recommend this for 2 year old and up!! My two other daughters love it too - 6 and 8 years!!! We highly recommend it.
4,Not bad,"It was larger than what i expected, but it fits nicely in my tank. Doesn't look like the picture, it actually has more ""stems""."
2,What were they thinking?,"This is a ghost movie. Oh wait, no, it's a slapstick comedy. Oops again, nope, it's a musical at one point. I love steam trains, enjoy old ghost stories, have an entire collection of musicals, and relish the silent slapstick comedies. This movie, unfortunately, tries to be all at once. What results is a movie that left me wondering, ""What the hell were they thinking?"" One reviewer hit it on the head: if they had left out Arthur Askey's inane character, and developed the ghost story more, they might have had something here."
3,Christmas in Plains,I learned more about President Carter than I did before but overall I was not very impressed with the book.
3,Enjoy In A Cozy Chair,"This is a perfect book to read at the holidays, curled up in a comfy chair with a good drink and a warm blanket.Who knew Jimmy Carter was so sentimental? I was impressed by his recollections of holidays from way back and by his gentle telling of the times at home and in the White House.A short little book with good feeling."
1,Christmas in Plains: Memories by Jimmy Carter,"I wish I could say that I am enjoying this book, but I am not. It was chosen as my ""book club"" choice for December. It is just plain boring in my opinion."
2,Books review.,"Paper material is bad, pale print with only black and white including charts and graphics, bad glue is used to stick up the papers, book started do dismantle after very short period.However the learning material within is very useful and mandatory for some courses."
2,very boring,save your money! unless your really into the 'thats what i call music' series! this is the adult version!
2,Not the right version of All Things....,The version of ALL THINGS is not the same as the TV version. It has a different beat and I can't get into. I wish I could have listened to it first before I bought it. I wasted my money...
2,Why?,A simple question for the record company and the producers of the show: why not put the TV version of the show's theme on the CD?Sadly disappointed.
3,"DON'T Get Heart Set on ""All Things"" Track!","The long awaited Queer Eye CD doesn't quite deliver ""All Things"" the way fans have been waiting for.I was hoping for a longer version of the catchy melodic TV theme. What is instead delivered is a pulsing remixy sounding dance version. Whaaaa!On the upside the rest of the CD is a coherent collection of great music.Hint - there are better MP3 club mixes (floating around) of the original TV ""All Things"" - no extra verses but the catchiness that got us hooked is better mixed!"
2,Beware of the remix,"The theme song from the show has been remixed for the CD, unfortunately; the rhythm track is annoying and robs the song of its original appeal. Why couldn't they have included the TV version as a bonus track? File this under ""disappointment."""
4,Good for working out,"Good work-out mix but I could have done without two of the songs on this CD. Otherwise, I enjoyed it."
2,Not as good as the rest,"My main problem with this book is that it takes Saul's POV the entire time, and to be honest, his need to contradict himself all the time just annoys the heck out of me and takes up too much space. I'm surprised Saul has a guardian angel at all actually. Narlh is the best reason to keep reading. And how stupid is Saul to never realize that Matt is the Lord Wizard of Merovence despite being told that at least 5 times in 3 days??? That one fact alone nearly made me stop altogether, till I realized Matt had to show up sooner or later so I kept on."
5,Great for new solid food eaters,I used this or my children when they started solid food and now using for my grandchildren. Good starter food.
2,Disappointing...,"We all have bad days.....and while I emphatically agree with the other reviewers that Carol is a major talent, this album lacks the energy and enthusiasm of her earlier ones. Also, the covers of ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" and ""Every Breath You Take"" made me hit the skip button. If you like this album though, you will be blown away by her first two albums ""LUCKY TO BE ME"" and ""INCLINED"". I bought ""The Language of Love"" on the blind, and while there are a few good tracks, I wish now I would have listened to it in the store first.To be sure, I played ""INCLINED"" right after listening to this album, and there is NO comparison.My advice, listen to it first before you buy it.....but in all fairness to Carol, the aforementioned two other albums are incredible, and I highly recommend them."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I bought this CD because of all the glowing reviews it received. I can't believe we're listening to the same album. All I heard was an overly breathy, average singer whose range isnt great [but like the advice in the Sondheim song she ""modulates""] and who lacks all a real singer's talents when it comes to interpreting and playing with the melody.To compare, I think Connie Evingson has a similar kind of voice, but is a MUCH better singer and interpreter of jazz music. And if you want to listen to REAL jazz greats, I suggest Carmen Lundy and Paula West.Maybe it's just my taste, because the other reviewers had quite a different impression of this singer. I think she was carried along by a great band, but if you like the singers I've listed, I doubt you'll like Carol"
1,Patience would have paid off,"Very, very disappointing. The main problem with this game is the fact that while the arcade version was a challenging, sweaty-palm action game, this has virtually no challenge at all. In fact, I beat the game in two weeks with all four characters at level 99 as the secret characters. This was put out six months after the game broke into arcades, and apparently more time should have been given it. Midway should have learned something from the previous editions of gauntlet on the nintendo, which actually kept some of the thrill of the arcade versions. Recommended only to diehard fans or inexperienced players."
3,N64 version is better,"WHile this adaptation of a classic game is certainly enjoyable, I have also seen the N64 version. The PLaystation, even witha 4 player adapter is still limited to 2 players and the special effects are not as good. THe playability however and the actual plotline are identical and enjoyable. While this game is certainly fun to play, if you have the option I would opt for a different format."
1,Not what was expected,"This game is an insult to the arcade. They changed way too many things like increasing your stats with gold and traps were missing throughout the levels. They were in too big of a hurry to get this on the market for the PSX. The graphics could have been better, and the limit of two players is a joke. If you really like Gaunlet Legends in the arcade, buy it for the N64. It was a lot better all around. Just stay away from the Playstations, because once you've tried it for the N64, you'll be disappointed in the Playstation version."
5,Old time meets new tech n64 style rocks,"I recently found out that Gauntlet was out for the n64. I played it when it first hit the scene and had some great memories playing it 4 person mode at the arcade. We fed a lot of quarters into that machine back then. I got the game for my kids this summer and it rocks. The family has enjoyed it and the effects are fantastic and the secret characters are an excellent bonus. Its still the same game of hack and slash, just as before only with better tech and graphics. If you only play one game this summer get out more. Just kidding. Overall and excellent game. try it out you just might like it."
2,Not as Good,"PS2 vision sucks, get the N64 vision it's way better. Not worth the money should be way cheaper than listed from buyers"
5,Gauntlet : Dark Legacy Rocks!!!,this game is so cool. the first thing in this game that you get to do that is cool is you get to fight zombies with your basic or heavy attack these attacks get more cooler as you progress thruogh the game. secondly the bosses are really cool but hard. i recommend this game for anyone who liked final fantasy 9 or 7. or for someone who wants a really good long game.
