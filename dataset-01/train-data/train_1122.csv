5,Pure Comfort,"I purchased a pair of these because I really life scuff slippers, something I can get into easy and kick off when I go to bed. I had a pair of another brand that was 20 years old but the leather sole had worn out. Much to my delight these have a thin rubber sole, so I can even wear them when I shuffle out to get the newspaper in the morning. When I come home at night these are the first things I slip on. I liked them so much when I got them, that I immediately bought a second pair. I like my slippers rather large. I wear a size 10, and while a size 10 fit OK, they just didn't give me that loose sloppy comfortable feel I wanted so I opted for a size 11 which are perfect. I also like that my feet don't sweat in these, I can't stand slippers that have the fluffy sheep lining, these have a lining that is like a flannel material, even though I think they call it fleece."
2,Only look good...,"I ordered these shoes for my husband and they run very narrow, he no longer wears them.He now has a new pair from another company for the comfort he needs after a long dayat work. I also ordered a similar pair for myself by Daniel Green, they, too were adisappointment, as well. You will have a problem in cleaning them, too. I did find outhow to clean my Daniel Green's, but after the shoes were cleaned, they were tighter onmy feet. These were meant as houseshoes or slippers for comfort at home, this did notprove to be the case for me."
4,Nips hooves; quite satisfactory,"To start, please don't buy this item and immediately try to trim your horses hooves. Damaging the hooves can seriously injure the horse, and it is VERY easy to do if you are inexperienced.That disclaimer out of the way, this is a decent set of budget nippers. I wouldn't want to operate a farrier's business with them, but they work well for quick trims in between the farrier's visits."
5,widowed,"I was widowed nine years ago. I was lost, because I depended so much on my husband's financial and emotional support. I was lucky, because he planned ahead. Reading this book helped me so much to learn to make decision, and manage my own financial. Since then, I have been buying these books to give to friends who also have met this situation. Unfortunately ""widowed"" of Dr. Joyce Brothers are no longer available in Manila, Philippines. J. Yao"
4,Really hits home,"I have read many books on grief this last year since my husband passed suddenly. I liked this book because it was easy to relate to the topics that Dr. Joyce wrote about, such as taking those scary first steps to create a new routine and life without your beloved partner by your side as well as the mixed emotions of doing so. There are also some good points that only widows can relate to in regard to their new social status and not being defined by that. I was anxious to read this book given the fact that it was authored by a celebrity of means and I was not disappointed."
3,"Great Cash, Distracting Production","When SILVER first came out, it was significant in that Cash was collaborating with some of the hottest writers and musicians of the time. It also marked his first recording of ""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky"" and a hot, acoustic-driven studio version of ""Cocaine Blues"" (still a risky topic for a post-outlaw country album). Still, as much as I admire Brian Ahern's production of Emmylou Harris albums, I prefer the more spare production that Rick Rubin has given Cash's more recent efforts. The rugged integrity of Cash's performance, in my opinion, does not benefit from the polish of Ahern's production."
4,John Is His Own Genre,"Silver leans toward the blues in materials and treatment, though the opening track--""The L & N Don't Stop Here Anymore""--is straight-ahead Cash, with some tweaks in instrumentation. George Jones fans will find here three tracks, two of them CD bonueses, on which he and Cash harmonize. Not great Cash, perhaps, but Silver is very, very good."
1,Painful to listen to,"Whoever paired Johnny Cash with the producer and backup musicians on this album ought to be shot. ""Overproduced"" is an understatement on a number of these tracks.""(Ghost) Riders in the Sky"" was the big single on this album, but it hasn't aged well, tinkling synthesizers and guitars with special effects sound especially jarring with Cash's rough hewn voice.Trust me, you buy this album, you'll listen to it once....but I'll wager you don't listen to it a second time."
3,"Good book, but not great","Giving it Their All, the Backstreet Boys Rise to the Top is a good book, full of information. The problem is that some of that information is wrong. The book also skips around and repeats a lot of facts, and that gets confusing. The pictures in the book are great, really cute and funny, and I haven't seen them before. But there are not very many of them. But all in all, it is a good book for any Backstreet Boy fan, and we need to keep the pride alive. Good job Sherri Rifkin."
4,Pat Boone does heavy metal music,Great elevator music. If you like Pat Boone and love rock this may be just for you. I bought it as a gag-gift for heavy metal lover and he was impressed.
2,Pat Boone - 'In A Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy' (Hip-O Records),"Review no. 105. I remember when this (un)expected CD hit the stores + shocking (sort to speak) the music world. Twelve tracks of the beloved Mr. Boone giving metal / hard rock classics his personal touch. I'll say this much for Pat Boone - he came up with an idea that certainly was completely original. I mean - he took songs like Alice Cooper's ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"", Guns 'N Rose's ""Paradise City"" and Ozzy's mainstay ""Crazy Train"" (to name a few) and had managed to make them sound entirely like a different song altogether. Too much of a crack-up to give a one-star rating. Deserves a two-star rating for the novelty alone."
2,"Boring mostly, sometimes ok","If I hadn't been so hype'd ahead of time about what a king of bad classics this is, I would've been less disappointed. When I hear ""bad"", I think of The Shaggs, Telly Savalas, & countless one-off artists, etc. And, make no mistake, this is B-A-D stinky. But it's really just a lounge guy doing metal songs, and done not half as well as Richard Cheese, who always manages to find the ""soul"" inside the original and gives it his all when carrying it over in his own magical way to the lounge version. But we're talking Pat Boone here, who is so devoid of soul in his singing that it's mostly just plain boring. There's a couple that are pretty funny, which is why I gave it 2 stars. But I wouldn't call this the ""king of bad albums"". But maybe the irony of it being the historical nemesis of rock himself performing it adds a level of surrealism. But if you didn't know it was Pat Boone singing it, would it be as entertaining?"
5,PAT BOONE RULES!!!,"If you are a heavy metal fan, you'll want to check this out. If you're not, check it out anyway. I must admit that I certainly was impressed by what I heard. My faves here are: ""Enter Sandman"", ""Panama"", ""Smoke On The Water"", and the title cut. For those who have criticized Pat for this, please lighten up and give him a break. Great stuff, and perfect for parties as well."
5,Greatest Concept Album Ever,"Seriously, if the concept is how to arrange a ton of rock songs into snappy, Frank Sinatra-esque arrangements this albums is top notch. Not only is it totally hilarious hearing Pat Boone talking about ""getting stoned"" on his long way to the top if you want to rock and roll, the production values are outstanding. I will literally snap my fingers to some of the gems on here. Even the songs that don't seem to fit work in some bizarre way (like Love Hurts). I cannot recommend this album any more. It is truly a high water mark of our civilization."
5,HILARIOUS! AN ABSOLUTE SCREAM!,"When I first heard about this, I said ""no way. Pat Boone meets Guns and Roses?"" Then I heard it - and I about fell out of my chair laughing. Pat Boone's deep, mumbly voice and the brassy, big band sound combine to form the funniest parody CD I've ever heard. This CD is a must-have."
4,Absurd? Stupid? Only if you know nothing of music....,"Ignore the opinions of Amazon.com and the Seattle ""fan"" who reviewed this album. If a song is a well written song it will be able to cross musical styles and still be great. This album proves that not only are heavy metal songs great, but that Pat Boone can takes risks to be creative. With great players and arranging, this album has some of the coolest musicianship I have heard in a very long time."
3,"Lighten up, it's just for fun!","In a Metal Mood is just some light easy listening, big band arrangements of some ""classic"" metal songs. It's just for fun. If you're expecting heavy metal this isn't for you. But what a great way to make metal more acceptable with third agers."
2,More twisted than William Shatner doing Mr. Tambourine Man,"I had thought that William Shatner's renditions of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" were the apotheosis of twisted cover tunes. I was wrong, incredibly wrong, Pat Boone serves up 12 of the most twisted cover tunes ever done, including a big band version of ""Stairway to Heaven"" that probably has John Bonham spinning in his grave at 33 and 1/3rd RPM. The brassy, big band arrangements, backup singers and Boone's mumbling vocal stylings combine to form one twisted album that's an absolute howl. Fans of this sort of thing can only hope that a collaboration is in the works between Boone and William Shatner. Now that would be an album even funnier than this one."
5,Crazy crazy train! Choo choo!,"Pat Boone is awesome. ""In a Metal Mood"" is hilarious. Get these songs, groove on them, play 'em for your friends. They won't believe their ears."
4,Puts ME in a Metal Mood!,"One has to remember that Pat Boone did this in the 50's when he sang the likes of Little Richards' ""Tutti Frutti"" to sanitize the new form of musical expression; Rock 'N' Roll for a mass audience. Pat Boone's IN A METAL MOOD: NO MORE MR. NICE GUY did not surprise this reviewer. What was surprising was that it offended some conservative church-going folk who just didn't get the joke. This is a pretty good compilation of hard rock, heavy metal covers in big band & jazzy arrangements. There is a certain ingeniousness for all involved when one thinks about it. Who would think Ozzy Osbourne's ""Crazy Train"" could be arranged to sound like something one would hear on A.M. radio. This reviewer is waiting for IN A METAL MOOD: PART 2."
2,Best Left to the Imagination,"Trust me, what you imagine this CD might be like is a lot more entertaining than the disc itself. If the idea of this project appeals to you, pick up LOUNGEAPALOOZA or ANYTHING ELSE. You'll thank yourself, if not me.This thing might be worth having for the orchestrations and the backing vocals, which are darned decent, but our Mr. Boone is a total loss, even as a joke.If you've heard the world-class lameness of his AIN'T THAT A SHAME (He wanted to record it as ISN'T THAT A SHAME but even Pat had to admit it just didn't work.), then you already know he can't sing rocknroll. The bizarre thing is that he can't sing SWING, either. Mr. Boone's legacy seems fated to remain, ""See the USA in your Chevrolet."" Ah well. It's more than I ever accomplished."
2,A Real Oddity,"If you think the idea of Pat Boone attempting to sing heavy metal is bizarre, just listen to this little horror. Howver, as comedy, it is somewhat entertaining, with the same mixture of hilarity and revulsion to be found in watching ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Night of the Living Dead."" Musically, it is absolutely dreadful; however, in fairness to Mr. Boone, the worst cut on this disc is vastly superior to the best of anything ever done by Wayne Newton, although that is not saying a great deal; the same claim could be made for the Chipmunks. Be that as it may, this is a moderately enjoyable work of comedy for those whose tastes lean towards the weird."
1,"OH my gawd, is this stuff legal?","I love Pat Boone and I'm hoping this album is tongue in cheek. It not, then it's arguably the worst album ever recorded."
2,This is worse than I thought,"I thought that Pat Boone was going to eschew his sqeeky clean image and sort of goof on himself by doing metal (of course ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is not metal but... whatever). Instead, the arrangements do justice to Nelson Riddle. A good goof on himself would have been Ibanez guitars roaring with the distortion petals activated. Rather, we get a 1940s big band sound. If this is a goof, it is a subtle one that went right by me. I actually think the guy was serious."
1,Huh???? Say What?????,"This is very disturbing and very hilarious all at once! Is this akin to Sid Vicious singing ""My Way""???? LOL! :)"
1,I thought it was a really bad CD!!!!,The songs really stunk. This old prune couldn't write a song if it bit him on the butt. What he did to the songs was murder. He was trying to be something he isn't. He should just go back to the retirement home and have sponge baths.
1,worst. album. ever.,"Pat Boone said he listened to the music realized there were some good songs there, and decided to record them himself. So far, so good. But it's immediately apparent, from the very first note, that while Boone might go so far as to concede there are good songs in metal, he has NO understanding of metal whatsoever. He doesn't get it, at all. He doesn't get anger. He doesn't get energy. He doesn't get violence. He doesn't get rebellion. He doesn't get catharsis. He doesn't get ANYTHING that attracts metalheads to metal.I checked this out from the library, and still feel ripped off. I wish I could give it zero stars. It's like craving steak, but getting all your nutrition from sniffing stale perfume wiped on a picture of a cow. It's that bad."
3,WHAT WAS HE THINKING?????,"That was my first thought...then I read the (COPIOUS) liner notes and now I know. HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING GREAT WORK. ""I've ... never been more proud of a finished album than this."" That is pretty sad...but then again, he made a fortune covering people like Little Richard and Fats Domino, so maybe he thought he could pull this off, too.Unfortunately for the self-deluded Mr. B., the audiences are a little more sophisticated now than they were in the 50s and 60s, and black artists are played on mainstream radio stations in a way they weren't back then. But, as has been noted by many, this is pretty funny (in a scary sort of way), and I'm grateful to my brother (HI, JOHN!) for sending it to me for my birthday. I probably won't listen to it more than once, but hey..."
1,Nauseating,"The problem with this project is that it simply isn't campy enough to be enjoyable. It's pointless, perverse and asinine. Pat Boone should be drowned in excrement."
4,This old bastard....,"Honestly, save two songs he released during the 50's: ""Love Letters in Thee Sand"" and ""April Love"", I hated Pat Boone. I wouldn't exactly say that I'm now his No. 1 fan. However, I have to give him credit on this one. This album gave an exciting and interesting new twist to these old metal tunes. I especially like his renditions of ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" and Smoke on the Water"" Now look, if you're a die hard metal fan like I am, but aren't willing to lend an ear to something different, no this album isn't for you. But if you enjoy listening to and laughing with an old guy that's willing to prove that he's still down with the times, then listen to this. Hey, if you don't like the music, it's worth a buy, just to get a good laugh."
2,Old White Bucks is back...in black,"Here we have ""Mr. Soft, Safe and Sanitized"" himself taking a crack at some hard rock songs. The songs are rearranged in a big band style, which doesn't really work, although ""Smoke On the Water"" is kinda fun. For someone that was one of the original rock and roll stars, Pat still has no feel for singing rock songs. Some people might think this album is ""so bad, it's good"". I'll admit that listening to one or two of these songs can be amusing, but after hearing a whole album of it, I'm saying ""enough already!""."
1,"great concept,lousy execution","This doesn't even make it as good big-band music.You are waiting for the familiar lyrics to be spoken (he doesn't really sing) and it's like knowing the answer to the questions on the Millionaire game show.You begin thinking that by yelling the coming lyrics to your speakers,the person singing will speed it up a bit.Please, no more cross-genre wastes of plastic. But as a publicity stunt this could not be beat."
3,I was drunk when I bought this,"But I'm not really regretting it. I think the shine in the eye drew me in. I'd forgotten I'd ordered it, and when it came I was a little wary of putting it on. But when the horns kicked in on the first track, I knew that Pat was in it for real. It is a serious effort, which is funny enough, and, at times, it succeeds. The band is killer, but don't be fooled into thinking they're metal. The weakest point is Pat's voice. I really wanted to hear his innocent crooning, but his voice sounds aged. I guess that's to be expected...."
4,Totally hilarious!,"I grew up listening to my parents playing endless albums by the squeaky clean Pat Boone. Never did I envision that 30 years later I would actually plunk down my own money for a Pat Boone album, but this was worth it. If you are a fan of the absurd or campy, this is the pinnacle of that art. Previously I thought that Bill Shatner's warbling ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" was the epitome of hilarity, but this takes the cake.Pat singing Smoke on the Water will have you on your knees, crying tears of laughter, especially if you grew up on Deep Purple's original version. How about his cover version of Van Halen's Panama? I thought I would choke from laughter when I first listened to this gem. I have to give Boone credit. He good naturedly spoofs his own white buck shoe image and produced this album whic raises camp to a high art form. I love this album and recommend it to anyone with a sense of the absurd and a acerbic sense of humor."
5,pure genius,"this is the funniest [stuff] i've ever heard. but i think it only works if you like any of the songs covered. i definitely don't think the [person]writing the review had a clue what was going on. i can almost see pat boone singing with the disclaimer that 'yeah, i got no business singing these tunes, but what the [heck] i'm a huge dio fan and his rendition of holy diver is incredible. it makes no sense; yet i find myself listening to it over and over. some of the other tunes are [great] as well, such as stairway, which just sounds badass when he does it. i equate this album to watching an episode of the simpsons. some things don't make sense when you first see(hear) them, but over and over again it's just plain funny."
5,Really funny!,"I bought this CD and Lounge Against The Machine by Richard Cheese together. It's really funny and a unique take on some old favorites. I'm currently playing Hoyle Casino Empire, and it allows you to use your own MP3's as background music. I thought these would be perfect for a casino atmosphere. Another plus is that you can finally understand the lyrics. And to those of you who wrote negative reviews, please lighten up a little."
4,Gerontology Fun,"A story of the same gender attracted beautiful female-cum-""mister"" pimp making by herself good money on very rich women seeking solace from women, who gave a birth to a boy just to leave him with mother of her.What is all this about? Sex-sold money doesn't smell! Not much news."
3,Great looking but hard to walk in.,"While this shoe looks absolutely fabulous and I get a million compliments any time I wear it, it is next to impossible to walk in because it is very hard to keep on your foot."
3,rather dull and predictable,"after reading ""whodunit"", i thought that the smallville novels were on the way up finally. this book was rather dull and lifeless and really not worth buying. it's main focus is a teenage girl named heather fox who is an animal right extremist.she discovers that if she touches an animal she can transform into that animal and decides to seek revenge on any human who hasbeen cruel to animals. this is rather extreme considering that this setting is in rural kansas and the woman seems like she needs to keep her opinions to herself. if you have read some of the other smallville novels, the ending is way too predictable.the tv show is beautiful but most of the novels are pathetic atbest."
5,Great Jerky!,I prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one. They're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips. If you like old-school jerky then I highly recommend this product. Delicious!
1,Piece of junk (should be zero stars),This is a piece of junk and the description is misleading. Don't buy it! See more detail by searching for item B0002H0CQI.
2,glasses usually fall off,This product has not proved to be very useful at holding onto my glasses. Not enough grip in the area where they connect to the paddles so I frequently find my glasses hanging by only one side or the other.
1,Grips Don't Hold,I bought these for my husband who has Parkinson's and whose chin rests on his chest. The grips did not hold the glasses next to his head and still slipped off his nose.Chums Original Cotton Standard End Eyewear Retainer
5,You Call The Shots,"You call the shots, an audio book that I purchased. Was inspiring, creative, no matter what your age, anyone can do this. If you are thinking about starting your own business, doing it on the Internet. This book is for you."
3,Call the Shots,"This item arrived quickly and was a great price. It was in good condition. I was told it was a good success story, I don't agree. Thank you."
5,Inspiring even to 40 year olds!,"I thought I will never listen to someone younger than me much less a 21 year old but Cameron Johnson knows what he's doing and he's inspiring. In the web business ,I always thought that companies need millions of venture capital funding , master programmers and MBA holders to become successful, Cameron Johnson proved otherwise. Further more all this wisdom was packed in a light easy to read book. Easy not because it has few pages but his story is so interesting you want to read further more in every chapter.The writing is clear,concise and full of details,examples and advice without being didactic. I learned so much."
4,Good and safe service.,"Before I bought this book I was a little worried if I would got this book in my hands ever because to purchase it by internet. I have the book in my hands now, and they were fast sending it to me. One week approximately to get to Spain in a standard sending."
3,Impressive and Inspiring Story,"I spoke to my son's class on entrepreneurship and the students were only marginally interested in what I was saying. But then I told them about Cameron Johnson who started his first business at the age of 9 and was offered $10 million for a business when he was 19. That perked their ears up. The book isn't so much of a ""how to"" as a biography of his journey that includes information budding entrepreneurs can learn from his experience. Its an interesting and inspiring story."
5,I Couldn't Put It Down!,"I have a lot of business ideas and I'm really not content with how some big corporations treat their employees because of age and ""position"" - regardless of performance - age seems to be their limiting factor.Cameron Johnson blows the limiting factor of age out of the water! His story was inspiring and I couldn't put it down - It was well written and the passion he has for business is evident through everything he does whilst maintaining a balance in life. Great Read - I'm Glad I didn't hesitate to buy it! The funny thing is I'm not usually even a 'reader' but I just couldn't put it down."
1,Find Another Book,"I purchased this book for $1 at some dollar store. I overpaid.The ""secrets"" revealed in this book are available in any simple entrepreneur magazine article on-line. The stories used to exemplify the ""secrets"" are set in the boom and bust years of dotcoms. The stories don't actually correlate to the ""secret"" discussed in the chapter, are about teenage angst and not business or just ring as gimmicks during a gimmick era. Beanie Babies? Cyber Squatting? Stealing another companies idea, modifying their business model and beating them to market then shuttering the company in under a year? Not a solid foundations for starting a successful ""company"" built for longevity. In fact, you can see the short shelf life of the ""companies"" he started through out the book.The only reason this book was published was the age of the author. He's just another dotcom gimmick to avoid."
2,Unwatchable,"I have to agree with everyone who says it looks fake. Some of the scenes looked fake after just a couple of seconds. Some were better, but after closer examination, still looked wrong.Also, the one scene that was almost watchable, had pixelization issues. It looked worse the longer you looked at it. Just awful. I feel like I completely wasted my money.Really, how much trouble can it be to set up a camera and videotape some *actual* snowfall for half and hour? Why bother to make the fake scene?"
1,Looks Cheap,These earrings don't have much sparkle and look a little on the 'cheap' side. Very disappointed in them - they were returned.
3,What you would expect,"This book is exatly what you could expect from a ""do it yourself book"", good eplanations, illustrastions, all the pictures are clear and easy to see.In short This book is A OK !A WORD OF WARNING: The book does NOT cover the changes made to the FZ-750, in the end of 87. Changes are: quad piston discbrakes engine upgrade to 107 BHP. minor elektrical changes"
3,A Qualitative research book,"This book seems a bit anti-science. The authors seem to have a great love of human culture but dislike science. Almost every page the authors need to say something bad about science. Therefore, if you have a logical and scientific mind, I won't recommend this book."
2,Not as good as the Shabbat one.,"This CD has copies of the a couple of the Shabbat songs using the word Hanukkah instead, which I think is kind of lame. The songs are not as catchy for kids as the Shabbat songs. I'll be continuing my search for a fun Hanukkah CD for my daughter."
1,Beware--poor transfer and lousy aspect ratio,"On this German disc, the transfer is pretty poor and the aspect ratio is 1.33:1 (4:3). A disc like this shouldn't exist at all, but once made, it should be in a bargain box, priced around $5."
3,Good but better is his other one. Instrumental Appetite,"This was a very good project and aspects of it were cutting edge for the christian genre then, but the project to look for, ( as I am doing LOL ), is ""Instrumental Appetite"" , Straight forward piano jazz with ramsey lewis overtones. When you hear it and think how young he was when he did that level of playing. Phew !"
4,Bad cover art,I didn't buy this book because I found the cover disturbing to look at. The heroine looks like she's had a botched nose job.
3,Charming,"Although better known for the books she illustrated herself, Beatrix Potter also penned this short, sweet story. Published after her death and supposedly based on an actual event, this tells the story of a dove trapped in an abandoned building. It is freed, along with the fledgling hatched in captivity, when its mate attracts human attention to the shuttered cottage.This story runs about as long as any of the Peter Rabbit books, and has the same gentle spirit. Although there's a bit of excitement, especially near the start, it shouldn't keep a read-to-me kid up past bedtime story hour. If a Potter fan can find this at a reasonable price, there's sure to be some enjoyment in it. I wouldn't bust the budget hunting it down, though.-- wiredweird"
3,Money Rules,"A simply calm nice philosophical drama (tragic comedy?) tells of a typical-un-skilled-aged consumer's request for money, which was realised with a sort of a sex service, for what one being confronted by son of her unable to provide an adequate treatment for a gravely ill grandson of her.The happy end of this story is finding a boyfriend for a grandma as peace of mind followed pragmatism and reality of an ancient notion ""Money does not smell""."
3,Odd collection,"An odd collection of tracks that doesn't feel cohesive. That said, it's a pretty good party CD -- lends itself to being on in the background more than to focused listening. The only reason I bought this was to get the track ""Don't You Wanna Make Love"" which I've been unable to find *anywhere* else on CD. That track is a lost gem. The inclusion of ""Popcorn"" is almost baffling, but, again, would be fun to hear (and have a laugh about) at a party."
4,Super hero,"As all of her books this is a nice love story that has ups and downs, Michael is a super hero for her because she save her life in the waterloo war, of course she did that for love, you will see that when you read the book.As all the super heroes stories it has his parts that couldn't be real, but you will enjoy reading this book."
5,Excellent!! Will remain in your memory forever!,"I cried, which I rarely do with books. Michael Kenyon is the perfect shattered hero. Through the book he learns to deal with his shame over nearly killing he best friend and unhappiness over the dislike his family has for him. There are many touching scenes and one was when he and his brother find that they can actually be friends instead of distant, unwelcoming stranger. A MUST READ!!"
3,Actually..3 1/2 stars.......,"I enjoyed ""Shattered Rainbows"",however, Its definitely not my favorite Putney. I read this book without reading the previous books in the series. It held its own, but I think maybe I would have appreciated it more if I had experienced the stories that preceded it as well. All in all, not a bad book, but not one that I would re- read."
3,Good product but original one defective,"When it works properly, this is a great product. It's easy to advance slides remotely, or go backwards, at quite a distance from the screen - and the flash drive holds a lot of presentations. The laser pointer is good too. However, the original product that I purchased wasn't so hot. The scroll wheel for advancing slides didn't work very well, and sometimes got stuck for reverse motion. Plus the flash drive locked up after only a few uses. The company sent a replacement, though it took a little time to get my refund for the first one."
3,review of portable air conditioner,"Overall, I can only marginally recommend this product. It certainly does not cool down a 400 square foot room, as it claims. It is probably effective with smaller rooms, however. Also, it is very noisy, and it only seems to become more so the longer you use it. Furthermore, the instructions are not very clear. I still have not figured out how to empty out the water from the unit, and the instructions have been no help. It seems to me that they modify the unit over time, but do not take the time or endure the cost to update the instruction manual. Nevertheless, it does produce cold air, which is far better than circulating warm air with a regular fan. I have the feeling that one is better off spending a little more and getting a better unit."
1,worst air conditioner i've ever bought,cannot chill a room of any size. exhaust tube heats up room more than it can chill. less than 4 years later it's dead. no thanks. costs more than a window unit with less power. whats the point
1,air conditioner or heater??,"I purchased this item and recieved it the next day, missing two wheels. Also, it hardly works. The air that it's blowing out is not very cold and it can hardly keep my bedroom cold. I am very dissatisfied and plan to send the item back."
1,It arrived broken 2(!) times,"Amcor ALD12000E 12000-BTU Portable Air Conditioner with Electronic ControlsI can't review the product because it arrived 2 times broken. I can say that AMAZON has a great service team, the company keeps their word, but it can't to pack up their products."
4,Learn more about the real Pickett,"This well-researched and well-written biography of General George E. Pickett gives an unvarnished look at a southern soldier who has been shrouded in mystery. I've read a lot of Confederate history and this one comes the closest to describing the real Pickett than any other. This book is entertaining, yet grounded in historical fact. The insights into marriage of the day are also valuable. Author Gordon successfully separates fact from fiction. She does not try to separate LaSalle Pickett's influence on the life and memory of George and it's a good thing because it's impossible to do so. This biography left me wanting to learn more about George and Sally Pickett. Too bad the Pickett descendants won't release the letters they have in private collection. Great book!"
1,Sloppy & Biased,"I read the book and thought it was pretty good. That is, until I learned from a lecturer about its mistakes. There is a picture in the book captioned as being of Pickett when in fact it's another man altogether. You'd think someone who did their research and wrote a book on this man would at least get that right. In another part of the book there's a quote from one of Pickett's men. The author edited the real quote and ended up leaving the last part off trying to portray Pickett as a drunk. It seems as though the author had other motives than revealing truths when she wrote this book."
4,Some Great Overlooked Crichton,"Three Crichton novels done an enormous disservice by the silver screen. CONGO is a great variation on his recurring theme of technology run amok. EATERS OF THE DEAD, unjustly ignored for many years, is a rip-roaring retelling of Beowulf. SPHERE is a taut and engrossing thriller that grabs you till the very last line. Oddly enough, these three works actually require LESS intellectual gymnastics than his more lucrative works-- these function quite well as adventure/thriller yarns. If you want to go digging for thoughtful nuggest, they're there, but these are three novels that work very nicely as summer beach reading. Getting all three in one volume is an especially tasty deal."
3,"Odd, but enjoyable.","Sarah Canary was a love/hate reading experience for me. I hated the endless journey of the story, but was inexplicably drawn to Sarah quite like one of the outlandish characters in the book.The characters, Sarah's antagonists, were given to such extreme behaviour as a way of simple survival in what we would call marginal civilization, that Sarah was fortunate to be impervious to their asperities. Because of this, however, the other characters were absolutely manic in their pursuit of her. Adelaide to support her raging martyrdom, Chin to assuage the demons that challenged his self-worth and the indomitable Harold, well, as for Harold, I'm not really sure.There is alot of territory covered, literally, much of which is quite precarious - including a close call with a caged tiger.The historical vignettes between chapters were a welcome twist.However, not a satisfying ending."
2,Can't wait for the last page,"I find this book slow, superficial, and dull. I keep waiting for something to happen, especially since a lot of people really really enjoy this book - am I missing something?I can't understand Chin's obsession with following Sarah around. I can't understand any of the characters' motivations and the plot doesn't flow, and neither do any descriptions or ideas.I can't wait to be finished with this book so I can start a new one (I don't like putting down books, especially since I've gotten so far)"
2,Sarah Canary Disappoints,"I was, unfortunately, a victim of the hype this novel has generated and went out of my way to obtain a copy. The writing is quite good for a first novel, but the title character of Sarah is not even well-developed enough to be called two-dimensional. She represents nothing and is nothing but a catalyst that brings disparate types of individuals together. The ending is a mishmash of diverse philosphies and ridiculous scenes which seem forced and stilted. Let this Canary fly away!"
1,Didn't like it.,I just could not get into this book. To me it was one of those where it didn't take long for me to realize that I just didn't want to read much further. I admit that maybe I should have given it a better chance and many times I'll do just that in spite of the fact that a book starts off boring but I simply had no inclination to read much more then 30 or so pages.
4,"eerie and haunting, unique and unforgettable","_Sarah Canary_ is the tale of a mysterious woman found in the Pacific Northwest in the days of the American frontier. She is dubbed ""Sarah Canary"" because she has no English, and possibly no language at all: her only means of communication is a peculiar warbling song which does not seem to mean anything at all: and thus, people who encounter her interpret it through their own experience and filters.In SARAH CANARY, Karen Joy Fowler takes the reader on a haunting journey through a long-forgotten time and place, where Chinamen are almost as alien as women who cannot speak, where spiritualists have the power to command huge audiences and change lives. Yet, it is a time and place with repercussions for our time and place, and the book resonates with contemporary readers.The mood and feel of SARAH CANARY stays with you for a very long time after you've put the book down: you may find that you want to go back and revisit it at a later date."
4,Delightful magical realism in the 19th-century West.,"This is an excellent book. I don't think I've read anything quite like it. A mysterious woman wanders into an encampment of Chinese workers in the 19th-century West. The men there are worried, both for her--she won't speak and clearly needs help--and for themselves, because they could get in a lot of trouble if a white woman is found in their camp.One of the men is assigned to follow Sarah Canary--an arbitrary name, since she won't tell anyone who she is--and get her back to civilization, or at least safely away from them. In the course of their wanderings, he and Sarah visit a hospital and a hotel, and her reluctant guide has to protect her, and himself, from men who consider a crazy woman and a Chinese man to be easy victims. Fowler shows us a different side of the Old West, one of the parts that doesn't involve wagon trains, gold prospectors, and cowboys."
4,Classic Love Story,"I first saw this movie when I was 13 years old. I am now 46. This is one of the best classic love stories that I had ever seen. Each time I see it the ending makes me cry because I truly think that ""Hubbell and Katie"" really loved each other. The story rang true for me because of the jock meets the radical and against all odds, they got together but then realized that sometimes love isn't enough. This movie will continue to be a true ""classic love story."""
5,"A classic, to be loved for generations","I saw this movie in the theatre as a teen. I have seen it on cable but sooo much was cut. I bought this for my 17 year old daughter for a gift. She laughed and cried in all the traditional places and has added it to her favorite list. I am sure that it will be shared, one day, with her daughter - far in the future."
5,"""Your girl is lovely Hubbel""","This is the ultimate chick flick...and how can you not love Robert Redford! What separates it from the myriad of other ""chick-flicks"" is the stong politically entangled plot. I'm not a huge Barbara Streisand fan...but I love love love this movie!"
3,The Way We Were'nt,"This film is yet another attempt by Hollywood to portray depression era communists as Idealistic or Indiana Jones type characters,not the schemeing Stalinists and ego maniacs that most were. Some idealistic young people did join Radical Left organizations, the sincere ones left when they saw the horrors of Stalin. Read HOLLYWOOD PARTY which goes into the history of this period in Hollywood and the Communist Party's role in the blacklist. The movie is only saved by Striesand's timeless song THEY WAY WE WERE."
1,The Way We Were,"I ordered this DVD, as well as two other favorites. After viewing the other movie and having constant interruptions or periods where the DVD froze so that I couldn't even finish watching the movie, I opened The Way We Were to determine if I had received a bad copy. While there were not as many interruptions or periods where the tape froze, I still experienced the same interruptions. At that point, I didn't even open the 3rd movie because I decided to return all three. Then I saw that I had to return within 30 days. Unfortunately I had just had an opportunity to watch the DVDs. Therefore, if I am not able to exchange the DVDs for better quality replacements, I will not re-order DVDs from Amazon."
1,The Way We Were DVD,"The DVD didn't work on our television! Not sure what to do. Will try it on other systems to make sure it isn't our technology. However, other DVDs are working on out television. Can we send it back if we can't get it working?CheerJackie"
2,I live in the wrong country for this film,"Read the title. It was not made expressly clear that this film was not a USA formatted film. Therefore, I purchased a movie I can never watch, great product right?"
1,disappointed,"Is there anyone out there that agrees with me that this movie is big disappointment? I will agree that Redford and Streisand are great actors, I've seen their work before. They did great for the parts they were given to work with, but this movie wasn't up to par with their talents. I am a person very easily moved by human experiences, fictional or real. This movie did nothing for me. I couldn't lose myself in their lives. The plot seemed choppy and I wasn't drawn to any of the personalities portrayed. For all the hype about it for so many years...what a let-down!"
2,What's all the fuss about?,"This film was two hours of my life, that I won't be getting back. It was slow moving, not edited that well and the plot was pointless. I have seen other films with minimal plot, but unlike this one, the characters were well developed."
2,The Way We Were CD,"I really like the movie and was looking forward to seeing it again, but the CD skips. I was very disappointed."
3,Kind of boring,Gave it 3 stars because I love Barbra otherwise it was kind of boring and couldn't get myself to watch the whole thing (or even 1/2 of it) but did fast forward after a while.
3,everything always come so ez to me!,"and that is why he hoooked up with Katie b/c she jumped over backwards to make him physically happy, with the dinners, pampering, availability, chasing after, etc., and this made for such an unbalanced romance that was shallow and never created the moment even at the end where you think these characters were ever deeply in love and never have I seen Barbra with any of her kids in movies, what is with that??? guess those long red nails ever present in every age timeline might get messy with a diaper change... love both of these guys but bad lighting and choppy vacuous dialogue just created dissapointment... the surprise element is the communist party presence on college campus and the admiration for the soviets... thought she had a pic of Lenin on the wall and references to Leningrad but Stalin was in power, a real hero... what a mistake that was! so we end with Ban the Bomb, start with this film...."
1,The Way We Were,This may be a classic. I know that lots of people enjoyed this movie. I was not one of them. It was extremely disappointing.
1,The Way we Weren't,Love the movie and thats why I wanted to buy it! I never got it nor have I gotten a response from Amazon about it's non arrival. I have placed my last order with Amazon as they do not understand shipping!!!!! If you live in a semi rural area where you have USPS only to PO Boxes and ground shipping to your home Amazon does not have a way to make this work.
1,What a douchey movie,"What a dreadful bore. If this movie were rated in z's, it would be rated zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....How anyone ever came to love Barbara Steisand, I'll never know.Talk about preachy! omg, what a harpy! I will gladly admit she was enjoyable in Meet the Fockers, however.Thank you Turner Classic Movie channel for saving me the $ of purchasing this DVD.Run, don't walk, away from this sappy borefest."
5,The way we were,So happy I was able to find the special edition for such a low price! Brand new in condition and speedy delivery
3,The Way It Could Have Been..,"I echo the previous reviewers comments. Why they couldn't have put back the original footage is beyond me. I got ripped off by buying a supposedly remastered version of ""Funny Girl"" a year or two ago and discovered some of the poorest quality video I have ever seen. I am pretty leary of anything that comes from Columbia video. My take is they make no effort whatsoever to produce a quality product. Streisand's films were some of their biggest moneymakers and they haven't put them out on DVD. When they do, I fully expect lousy transfers and low quality."
4,The only movie I could ever watch with these two,"Please don't take my man card away for watching this movie. But the story line is great and is a good timeline piece. I could relate to the characters. I like the way Babs portrayed her commie self. I normally can't stand love and drama, but in this movie love was the thing that brought the characters together and tore them apart. I thought the writers were very clever on how they showed a very passionate driven compulsive relationship with a guy who lives for the moment and everything comes easy. Plus I know what it feels like to be in love with the perfect person but to be just not good looking enough, or rich enough, or doesn't come from the right family. Ok maybe you should take my man card..."
4,WHERE DID ALL THE YEARS GO?,Saw it in the 70's.on our Honnymoon. My wife is a long time fan of Streisand and loved it. Where di all these years go.
4,Goy meets girl,"White bread WASP boy Robert Redford meets left-wing Jewish girl Barbara Streisand during the heady days leading up to, encompassing, and following World War II. Their initial romance is rather sweet. Streisand's character has had a crush on Redford's since college days--as Redford's guy is not only a goyishe Adonis, but an effortlessly brilliant writer to boot! I loved the hilarious scene where she hustles her drunken crush into bed! Their courtship proves fun and full of heartfelt emotions, but their ensuing marriage a complete disaster. I was unable to feel sympathy for the girl once they were married--she was a complete nag! No matter what he did, this poor schmuck just couldn't make this girl happy and find some way to lasso the moon in such a way as to complete her socialist utopia. Geez Lady--you should have found some way to give this poor guy a break!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though The Way We Were should be praised for not following a formulaic plotline, the complete dearth of chemistry between the leads and clumsy insertion of a McCarthyism subplot make this film a mixed bag; if you like romances you might like this one, but there are far better options out there."
4,"For such a great film, the dvd should have been much more!","I, like many thousands of others love this movie and could watch it over and over again. What should have been a 25th Aniversary spectacular is a very lack luster. My major complaint is with the 60 minute documentary.1.Great, we get to see some scenes that were cut that really SHOULD have been put in the film in the first place. How about the rest of the cut scenes? Legend has it that there is much more.2.Barbara's commentary is good but I really think she could have added a lot more. What about the screen play she supposedly was interested in that was, in essence, a part two of this movie entitled ""the way we are""?3.Redford is absent on the disc because of ""scheduling"" problems? Or so I have heard....Gee, nobody could have waited even to get 3-4 minutes of commentary from him? Something isnt right.I also dont think the transfer of this movie came out too well. Not exactly great quality for such an icon."
3,AVERAGE!,"It's no secret in Hollywood that about 45 minutes or so of footage was cut out of this film prior to its original release. 20 minutes of that was taken out after test preview audiences didn't like the political storylines!For the life of me, I can't understand why that missing footage wasn't put in this 25th Anniversary edition!!!!???????? And not even to put it in a wide-screen version is a further mystery!!!!!????????????"
4,the way we were,"such a good movie that i wanted it in my permanent collection! two beautiful people from different phases of society, beautifully acted."
4,the way we weren't,"A perfect vehicle for both Streisand and Redford. The stars seem to have been made for each other. It's Streisand's best dramatic acting in a film, without any music. Beautiful title song. The film went too light on the politics and too heavy on the romance. It could have been a far more important film had that not happened. Who told Streisand that she was not great when she was strident. When she is strident, she is near perfection."
5,It's Still The Way,"The critics had a field day when this was released: ""Barbra acts her head off"" And they were right.A simple story, beautifully photographed and lovingly acted, The Way We Were captures your heart. You can't help but feel that Streisand and Redford are close friends of yours. Every line, gesture and action on their parts rings true.No technical wizardry or special effects (save for a beautifully remastered tape) are used or really needed. Barbra never looked lovlier. The 40's style made people finally forget about Barbra's unique look and realize that she is as beautiful as her voice . . . And What A Voice!The title song is captured and you understand why it won the Academy Award and became one of her biggest hits.In total, this is a timeless movie that any serious collector should own."
5,One of My All Time Favorites,"This movie is one I loved so much, I had to add it to my collection so I could watch it more than once. It makes me cry every time. DVD was in great shape, too."
4,interesting carnival story,"Liked well enough to order a second copy as my first one was a different company and color inferior. All of cast give fine preformance on a story of carnival life. Anne Baxter is down and out and Steve Cochran ,the bad guy carnival employee offers Baxter job with carnival. Anne runs into one problem after another ,but overcomes them all by the end of the film. The story never drags and holds your interest and gives you a glimpse of the seedier side of carnival life."
3,ROAN EDITION!!!!!,"The roan edition of Carnival Story could have been better. It's an interesting film and plays well. The only issue with Roan on this one are the number of bad splices toward the end of the film. I have seen another print of this film on a 50-movie pack without the splices. After watching a number of different Roan DVD's, on occasion they have splice problems with some of their prints. I don't understand why they just don't use 2 prints of a film to make a good one. This is the reason I have to knock off stars."
4,Carnival Story,"I really don't remember were I first saw this movie might have been on TMC or AMC or the many countless videos that I checked out at Blockbuster, I laughed my head off, this movie is so bad that it's good, this movie is about woman who loves scoundrel reminded me a lot of Gérard Depardieu ""Lou Lou"" his a no good hood, but these women sure are attracted to them like cat nip..Worth seeing"
4,Recommended by Michael Cunningham,"I read this book on the recommendation of Michael Cunningham (The Hours), who said, ""If Samual Delany were writing in the same innovative, intelligent way and his books were not science fiction, he'd be know to every serious reader and not just a relatively small band of us.""Need I say, ""I agree?"""
4,Why mess with perfection?,"I just got the original london cast double cd today, and I love it. I haven't heard the new Starlight, so I gave it 4 stars, which was the average since I can't comment on it.I just wonder why they messed with perfection. There's wonderful songs on the london cast that aren't on this cd: There's Me, Belle the Sleeping Car, Only He, and Only You to name a few.I just don't get it. I'll have to pick up this cd, but I'm so glad I have the original....if you don't have it, you're missing out."
2,Webber Gutted the original to make this kiddie schmalz,"I am one of those minority of Lloyd Webber fans who counts Starlight Express as my favorite show. The original (and even broadway) versions of the show were filled with actual subtext, hilariously clever sexual innuendo, and archetypes that actually meant something. All of the clever innuendo has been removed from the show, Richard Stilgoe's lyrics have been softened and frankly Starlight has been altered from an adult fairy-tale into a kiddie show that parents drop their kids off at while they go gamble in Las Vegas. The ""New"" recording has some fine performances and the new song ""Crazy"" is cool, but ""Next Time I Fall In Love"" is so synthy and schmalzy compared to the very moving ""Only You,"" which can only be found on the German soundtrack as one song (it was changed after London). I was disappointed with this recording, and I listen to it less than any of the other half-dozen starlight recordings I have."
1,More like L-A-M-E,This is the sugar-coated kiddie version of a truely wonderful and inspiring show. It was the first show I ever saw and this hacks it to pieces. The 80s music isn't even that outdated; I mean they revived 'Sound of Music' and thats anchient compared to this!
4,new starlight,"This CD is very good although a few songs from the old StEx are sorely missed, such as 'only he' and 'Belle'. the cast is wonderful and very competent, especially John Partridge as Electra."
4,Great CD,"This is a really good CD that really gives you the feeling of the musical. But it's not as good as the original cd (1984), but that's mostly because this one's more ""modern""."
4,pretty good.,"I have seen Starlight Express and a lot of the songs on this cd could not be found on the other starlight cds. It's a pretty good soundtrack, but I was looking forward to; ""There's Me"" and ""Lotta Locomotion"". I do recommend it."
3,Really good - - But Not as Good as the First,"I saw the original Starlight Express in London in 1987 and fell in love with this high driving, rocking musical. My friend brought me back this new version after she saw the remake in 1997. I was a little disappointed that some of the original songs and characters were gone, but the feeling and rhythmn behind the original is here in the new version. There's a little bit of every kind of music (rock, country, dance, 50's) to appease any listener. And there is not one singer whose song you would skip. The thing I like better about this version over the original is the little boy and his commentations. It really brings the story together. Though I would recommend this CD to anyone, my heart will always belong to the original."
3,A Worthy Purchase,"I was fortunate enough to see the original version in London in 1987. I have since see the remake twice since then. In a nutshell -- the original is better, but the remake is very, very good. If you purchase this version, and don't have the original cast...GET IT!The people who re-wrote the story turned it from the ""adult"" themed show that even kids enjoy (kinda like ""Grease"" -- there are LOTS of innuendos that only adults get) to a really good family show. Shame on them for omitting 2 of the better characters: CB, the red caboose who - I think - had the best part in the show; and Belle, the old sleepign car. Plus, they've omitted so many good songs from the original (""Only You"", ""There's Me"", ""CB"", ""Belle the Sleeping Car"", ""Lotta Locomotion"").If you have only seen the remake or are planning on seeing it as it is on tour, then you will enjoy CD."
2,Cheap material = screw head stripped on first use,"Bought this to take apart a digital camera. While trying to loosen the screw, which I admit was pretty tight, the screw driver got stripped. It is now unusable, and I never got the screw loose. Pretty cheap material, only good for light-duty work."
3,Not bad.,"Great for delicate work, horrible for anything where the screws are really stuck in there, everything's too small to get any torque on it."
4,Several uses still pleased,I have used these screw drivers several times now and am still pleased with them. They are great for taking apart and putting back together battery casings and sizing watches. I am not sure that they would hold up against more than gentle use but they are sturdy enough to handle everything I have tried so far. Corroded or overly tight screws may present a problem.
1,Poor quality.,"The #00 does not fit the iPhone 4s #00 screws, not even close. The product is very poor quality in my opinion."
3,Textbook,This book is a textbook and reads exactly like just that. If you can handle reading a textbook then you can handle reading this. Not exactly a book I'd read for fun.
1,avoid at all costs,I just bought this thing and it is horrible. It barely toasts bread and leaves one burnt grill mark on the bread while the rest of it isn't even toasted. The worst part about it is that it makes the bread smell like aluminum and I believe it is unsanitary.
1,Unsanitary Toaster,I was thinking I might really like unsanitary toast. I wanted to have it with my Tuscan Dairy Whole Milk.
1,U2 rocks but this DVD does not,"I am a huge U2 fan but how U2 could have authorized the release of this pile of #@%^ is beyond me. I am wondering what happened to the band that rocked Slane Castle? I won't rehash all of the negative reviews that slammed the video and editing as they were spot on. Blu-ray? Puh-lease. DTS sound and video on Live at Slane Castle was mind blowing, as was the performance and set-list selection by U2. Unfortunately that was not the case with this concert and you can really tell that this was the end of the 360 tour because they all looked and sounded tired. My hat is off to the engineering and logistics that went into the set and production. I can't imagine what that probably cost and took to haul that thing around from concert to concert. Hopefully the guys get some much deserved rest, fire whomever talked them into this over-the-top circus set approach and come back out with a real Blu-ray experience that we don't have to throw into the 'I want my money back' DVD pile."
4,The best of U2,After read all reviews I was concern about thisDVD. However when I watched it I was happy to buy this concert. I'm U2 fan.
2,Huge Disappointment...,"Having been to the Boston/Foxboro 360 show, I was pumped to see that this DVD had been released and couldn't wait to relive the show. Bottom line is that this looks like a 2 hour commercial or a music video. The director and/or producers are not at all concerned with attempting to document what it was like to see this amazing concert but make it a point to show us what fancy editing and camera magic they can do. It is ""cleaned up"" so much that you can't even hear the audience at all for the majority of the show. The only thing good about this DVD is the setlist, but it is painful to watch. Hopefully, the band releases another DVD of this tour and direct the director to make it more realistic looking with some great shots from a crowd standpoint. There is not even an intro segment that shows the amazing stage in light, the gigantic crowd, or the band even coming on stage. I would pick the Boston 2001 or even the Pop Mart Tour DVDs over this one any day."
3,360 dark camera shots,"REGULAR DVD, Pros- The stage is huge, playlist was cool, the sound was ok, 90,000 audience woww.Cons- the sound could be better, Most of the time the concert is dark, so you can not appreciate the stage and musicians. I own some U2 dvds, or watched others, and Slane Castle still the best."
2,Disappointing,"Longtime fan here since Boy.I was at this show, and this actually makes the concert seem better than it was.Bono's voice has been ""touched up"" quite a bit here, he's definitely on the downside of his career.Same quibbles about the the picture that others have stated. Definitely NOT of the caliber of other Blu-Ray Music videos, particulary Rush Snakes and Arrows live isBetter extras than last few releases.Better direction than last 3, Hamish Hamilton butchered those.Not on a par with Pop, Red rocks or ZooTV.Oh, and a completely mystifying decision as to why the ACTUAL show opener 'Breathe' is only here as an Extra, that's just a stupid juvenile decision.For completists only"
2,U2 Ain't What They Used To Be,"I saw U2 in 1992. Looking back, that was clearly their creative peak. The tours kept getting more elaborate, the songs kept getting weaker. Skip this DVD (and all other U2 concert films released in the last 15 years), get ZooTV instead."
2,1080i,"I thought it would be good, but i was sadly disappointed, when i first took it out of the book, i saw in very small letters, this bluray was in 1080i not 1080p. The quality shows it...I was looking forward to inviting friends over to see this, but i cant see myself watching the whole thing again, ever, maybe it will age like fine wine, like rattle and hum, i dont think so, how some someone could rate it so high, sorry! i just dont see it...if you have to buy it just get the dvd not the blu, its just not worth it..."
5,One of the best concert video I have ever seen,U2 thank you for such a excellent christmas present. As we missed the live show in Vienna this summer - thanks to wideworldticketstore.com...:-( - this video is a small satisfaction. And I can say it is one of the best concert video I have ever seen.
3,Yes.,I was here so I had to order it. But I was kind of surprised at the filming of it. It's not my favorite. It's probably my least favorite live U2 dvd.
4,I love U-2....they were the band during my college years...,"I do adore U-2...they were the alive band that I loved the most during my college years, coming up second was REM... That was 20 plus years ago...I still think they are unreal. I totally have enjoyed the dvd...it's just really a ""big production"" I would really like to see something though that's not so much a ""big"" concert..I guess I am stuck on my old U-2 memories from MTV with the group...I kind of miss that they are the small Ireland band that is so down to earth...this concert is not at all down to earth, lots of special effects, but I am grateful for this though...it is awesome...I am glad I purchased it..still I would love to see this awesome group not doing the theatrics and just doing rock and roll...I should just say..dah..enough said...love em..things do change...and I have to get used to it.."
5,"Best U2 concert video, ever!!","I pretty much own every U2 video that there is out there, and the Rose Bowl is the best one of their concert videos of all time. The production is great, the bonus features are great, the editing is great. Here's how I would rank 'em: Rose Bowl #1, ZOO TV from Sydney #2, Elevation 2001 from Boston #3, Vertigo 2005 from Chicago #4, and Under a Blood Red Sky from Red Rocks #5. Popmart from Mexico City would get an honorable mention."
2,Don't but this in Blue ray,This is quite possibly the worst video production I have ever seen. There some type of jerking thing going on that makes it unwatchable. Im sending this POC back.
5,u2 360 dvd,"Excellent video. Saw this concert in Norman, Ok. and wanted a copy of this video for memory's sake. Was not disappointed at all. Great concert."
1,Not worth the money,Probably the worst concert I have of U 2. This blu ray does not deliver and is a waste of money.
2,Very bad Blu-Ray resolution,I just watched the BluRay disc and I'm very disappointed with the editing of the concert. It looks the same as the DVD. The only difference is the HD Audio.
1,Disappointed,That's how I feel about this Blu Ray Concert. I saw the concert live in YouTube and I enjoyed so much that when I saw it for purchase in blu ray I jump right away. What a waste! They change everything! Don't even open the concert with the right song. The filming is obscure and cameras jump like a kangaroo. Is very hard to watch. Also the sound is not great. I like the concert even when they do not sing most of their hits songs but the filming sincerly sucks!
1,"Does not include opening song from the concert - ""Breathe""","I went to this show in person and it was amazing. That said, I just received this (single disc version) and I was very disappointed to realize that they did not include the opening song, which also happens to be one of the very best songs, of the show - ""Breathe"". Now, I need to pay to return it, and re-order the two disc version, which has that song on the second disc. I love U2, but they should have included all songs from the concert on the 1-disc version. I can not understand why they would leave off their opening number, which was such a highlight of the show!"
1,Very Disappointed,"U2 must of had in their contract with Live Nation that they could release this on DVD because it feels rushed. As others have commented, the show does not look like it's in high-def, the rapid camera changes are very annoying, and the whole spaceship thing is just plain silly.The other gripe I have is with U2. First, I absolutely love U2 and have seen them at least 10 times on various tours. What was so great about U2 for many of was the spontaneity of the group. You never knew what Bono was going to do and it was not uncommon for a five minute song to turn into a fifteen minute jam with Bono singing from the heart.I'm afraid that my favorite group is becoming more predictable. What I mean is that every show on this tour was pretty much the same. Hopefully U2 will return to that dangerous edge where you never knew if you were about to experience something truly special.And hopefully they will never let this editor touch one of their DVD's again."
2,I love U2 but this video is horrible,"I am a big fan of U2 and have all of their concert videos, including this one. This was a very disappointing video though. It is over edited. You don't feel like you're at the concert at all, because there way to many shot changes and effects. I don't know, maybe if you're 12 you'll like this video. I prefer watching the Youtube stream version over this."
2,Was damaged,"The video is amazing, but the problem is the DVD, during the video playing has a little pause and continuing again."
3,"Incomplete... no, really?","To everyone complaining about this being an incomplete show: every bleeding U2 concert is cut, one way or another, so what's the big deal about it? They are disrespectful of the concert going experince as a whole. I had my hopes moderately high about them leaping to Bluray but once again, they've done it.It's never been about media capacity, so I guess it's beacuse song copyrights, but this time they have edited out a U2 song? I would love to hear the reason why."
1,"Over Rated, Over Hyped","Completely lacking in brilliance or anything new, Bono and Co. just go thru the motions with their latest ""Dog and Pony"" show for another paycheck. This release truly confirms they are this era's most incredibly over rated bands and are mediocre at best. Having been decades since the release of ""The Joshua Tree"", their last brilliant offering, U2 fans have become a hypnotized lot, buying anything that this long, since ""gone"" combo churns out for a quick buck. I find this latest endeavor for them yet another round in their perpetual spiral of insignificance. U2 joke of the day: What's the difference between Bono and Jesus Christ? Jesus doesn't walk around Dublin pretending he's Bono."
1,Bored of Bono's shades,"Amazing set-list and sound, but why's the front man looking like he's on stage to perform a welding job?As far as those goggles go he's been wearing the same pair since the 90s. For a band that's always changing and taking new risks, isn't it time the front man did the same?The promo tour for NLOTH started off well with Bono looking mean and moody in eye-liner. Then people start bitching that a rock star in his late 40's can't do that (completely ignoring the fact that Iggy Pop, Dave Gahan and Michael Stipe still do it) and surprise, surprise, the googles are screwed back on for the tour!Next time you take them off during ""City of Blindling Lights"" Bono, throw them into the audience for good!"
1,This DVD and U2 suck.,"U2 sucks, always has, always will, and this dvd is horrid. Poor performance from the band, I guess they didn't have their polish machines handy. The dvd quality even such a poor performance is not worth the cash."
1,Dissapointed,"Hum, not having the opener breathe makes it look like an insult to every U2 fan. Save yourself a couple of bucks and just download the streaming version."
4,Espectacular!!,"I just receive this product and I love it! Is true that this blu ray does not have the quality that I was expecting, I read the reviews before my purchase and I agree with all the people that says that this Blu ray looks more like a DVD. However the concert is phenomenal!! The tracklist is the best one they can choose and the stage for this concert, awesome!!! I would like to give this concert 5 stars but the quality for this Blu Ray was not the best, anyway I think u2 fans MUST buy this concert!!!!"
4,"Great concert, OK picture quality.","Bought this at a great price on Amazon. 1/2 the price than at HMV.Great concert DVD for any one who has been to a 360 concert.When you watch it, lots of memories of the concert will come back and I found myself smiling many times while playing the DVD.I will buy it again if I lost it.I am a big fan of U2.Plus points:- Nice camera work. I found that it captured most of the atmosphere of the concert.- Nice mini booklet with tour photos.- Comes with a 2nd DVD with some behind the scenes stuff but I don't think I'll ever bother watching it.- U2 turns on a good show as usual. Performance-wise almost flawless. Fanboys will love this one.- With a good pair of headphones, the sound is superb.Minus points:- I watch this on my 3 year old 15"" Macbook Pro and am disappointed with the picture quality. Looks like a 1.5hour movie that it only 700mb in size you know what i mean?"
2,"You, too, can be disappointed with U2","Just got this with a gift card and feel like I wasted money.I have been a long time U2 fan, since the '80s, and have always enjoyed their music and video productions. I had looked forward to watching this on blu ray, and should have read these reviews first. This is by far the worst concert film I have ever seen. It has the quality of an amateur 16 year old videographer. Too many cuts/edits/jerky cam/zooming in & out. Very distracting and completely removes the viewer from a concert experience. I would expect this kind of camerawork for a music video, but not for a concert film.Can't finish watching it. Headache-inducing. 2 stars for the sound."
2,Sound Issues,I have never seen U2 in concert but I do own all their DVD concerts. U2 live at the Rose Bowl is the first one I bought in the Blu-Ray format and I am very disappointed in the sound. I have a dedicated surround sound room that is set up for 7.1 and this concert has barely any bass coming from my subwoofer. A couple of times it comes in for a few seconds during It's A Beautiful Day and in part of Elevation but the rest of the concert has no body. I am tempted to buy the regular DVD version to see if it sounds any better. I do like the set list as a lot are from the new album but that is the only good thing about this release.U2: 360 at the Rose Bowl [Blu-ray]
5,One of the Finest Live Videos of U2 out There!,"I am a long term U2 fan since they hit the US in 1980 with their album ""Boy"". Having collected many U2 video concerts, some good, some not so good, some terrible, I rate this one as one of their best!!!!! The performance was right on. The collection of songlist spanned back to 1983 to current and most importantly, the video and sound quality of this Blueray is superb!When I say this, I think back on U2 Live from Mexico City where the excited roar of the crowd drowned out the band in the background through musical passages of the performance and was absolutely annoying. Here you see U2 at the top of their game with great video quality, camera angles, and especially great sound. A must have for any U2 fan."
3,It's Not Cinematography.........,"Remember when the first Batman movie came out, and everyone said how ""dark"" it was? That is what this DVD is. Great band (on some days, my favorite), great musical performance. Drop the ""creative"" movie-making. Dark, slightly out of focus, artsy crap. I want a realistic document of the event. This ain't it.... Give me ""Under A Blood Red Sky"" anyday."
1,Mala Imagen,"ESte en un buen concierto pero solo por las canciones, en lo que se refiere ala imagen es horrible para ser blu ray, no vale la pena la compra."
2,Snoozer.,"Maybe you had to be there...this one is a snoozer. New songs are so slow, boring and Bono shows little inspiration in his lyrics. Bands new songs have lost any form of intensity, may be time to find another new sound. Bono speaks his way through majority of the songs, seems short of breath through most of the songs. Set looks awesome. As always, Edge brings it."
2,IT has to be the END !!!!!!!!!,"The worst performance i saw of U2, it seems like the band does'nt want to play anymore...sorry folks but for me it has to be the End !!!!!!! U2 no tiene ganas de continuar es lo peor que he visto en video, es una lamentable presentacíon que se basa mas en lo teconlógico, para mi es el fin, no me interesa mas !!!!!!!!"
3,"Great price, but not great quality","The picture quality of Blu-Ray is no good. There are no subtitles for the songs. The price was good, but leaves something to be desired in the requirement for money."
4,Not as good as it should be.,"New to Blu-Ray and was really excited to make this my first BD purchase, also as a momento of seeing this tour in Dallas. Read the average reviews but decided to go ahead and purchase locally. Pretty much accurate what alot of reviewers have been saying. Not really bothered too much by the reported rapid picture changes, but I definitely think the picture should have been better with all the HD technology out there. Sometimes looks pretty good and other times very grainy, may have something to do with the darkness of the venue in contrast with the bright stage lights. The sound is very good though through the 5.1. If you got 15-20 bucks to blow and your a U2 fan, pick it up."
3,Great concert but over saturated video!,"Overall the disc is great, but I'm surprised on how poor the quality of the video. Sound quality and performance are great. The video picture is over saturated and makes the picture not feel right; hard to believe this was intentional. All I can say is that next time they make a recording of their concert, please give us a no thrills manipulation of the picture. Film it, edit it, but don't muck with the video picture to make it unpleasant to watch! If your a U2 fan, it's worth getting the disc... after awhile the video quality numbs your overall negative about the picture quality. It's not my favorite video for U2 because of the picture quality, so it will not see as much airplay on my TV as it should, but I will play it for the sound on my stereo."
1,"Sadly, not good.","What is it with U2? I've seen them, I don't know, maybe 10 times since '87. Every show was completely amazing. I've always appreciated when they've reinvented their sound (well, maybe not on Pop) and am even a big fan of No Line ... (and it seems like I'm in the minority here). But, when I saw them in New York last year, I couldn't believe it was the same band. The sound was absolutely terrible and the performance was so lacking that, for the first time, I regretted spending tons of money to get great U2 tickets. I've never seen a band just go through the motions the way they did that night. I understand that they're getting older and all that (by the way, not an excuse - look at Metallica), but a band in their position owes it to the fans to maintain the standard they've been setting for the last 25+ years. Sadly, U2 didn't do that on the last tour and definitely not on this DVD - while the sound is ok, the rest of it comes off like a cheap cash grab."
1,Unwatchable,"After I found out the release date for U2360 and placed my order with Amazon, I watched the mailbox daily in excited anticipation of the arrival of my new Bluray. I was at the opening night show in Chicago and loved the show but was too far away to enjoy it fully, so this disc was to be the up-close-and personal version for me.It's not. I can't evevn sit through a whole song. The audio is quite excptional, but the video quality is horrible. The frame rate is so foul that it seems like the hardware is at fault. Based on other reviews (and swapping back to other movies) it seems the effect in intentional. While I can appreciate artistic vision, this is not that. It's just plain impossible to watch."
5,U2 Is Incredible!,This Great rock band delivers once again in this stunning 360 degree view of all their greatest hits. The sound quality is fantastic and the visuals are stunning. A must own for any fan of U2 and Live Music...
4,Woot,"This is a great condition book that is very, very hard to find. I really lucked out in this one!"
5,Perfect deck for Children or use with children,"I love this deck for a variety of reasons. One is that I can use it with children and the children ""get it"" every time. Its always accurate no matter who or where Ive used it with.I also love it for storytelling. Kids have great fun making up stories to the cards.When I was a preschool teacher the kids had fun drawing a card and talkng about it. No one suspected it was an actual tarot deck.It is fun, whimsical, fairy tale like and one of my favorite decks!!"
2,Nada,"This volume is so thick and so heavy that when it arrived, I couldn't wait to dig and delve into it for my upcoming trip to Spain. Our accomodation and flight plans already made, I was most interested in details about the Northern provinces we'll be driving around. Lonely Planet Spain does not seem to contain any details that don't have to do with hotels/hostels, restaurants, or public transport, or other practical topics. We were more interested in soaking up the flavors, the ambience, and the culture of the country and its people, its customs and traditions, its arts and its music. Guess it's just as well, as this tome would probably throw our luggage over the airline's weight limits.We'll be returning to and sticking with the good old Blue Book and Insight Guides."
2,Not Very Helpful,"I found most of the information in the book confusing to use and not updated information. Never did find any information on the hotel we ended up staying in. I did not get a good feel for the city using the information provided. I was hopeing for more information to make my trip a more affordable vacation. Overall, I got more information off the Internet just searching."
2,Poorly written,"This was our only reference guide to 6 weeks in Spain. We tried to use it for Hotels and buses and trains and all of the things a traveller would need to know. Instead of useful information, we were assaulted with so many adjectives and adverbs that bordered on stupidity, we almost threw the book away. It does contain some information of value if you can get passed all of the pompous verbiage. We did use the book for some things, but important information could be a great substitution for many adverbs and adjectives."
2,"Weak formula, little to no benefits.","One of the things I learned from Chinese herbalists, was that ""Western"" liver formulas are generally way too weak to be considered effective. With that said, I bought this product in a pinch. Felt like I needed a good liver cleanse. Well, I certainly didn't get one from this formula. It's just not strong enough, bottom line. If you want a super gentle liver ""petting"" formula, then yeah, use this product. I say ""petting"", because this formula absolutely will not cleanse your liver.If you want a liver CLEANSING/REJUVINATING formula, look elsewhere. You'd have to take 20 pills per day of this formula, to get the same effects you'll get from a good chinese herbal formula, such as liquid preparations of Chinese Bitters, Coptis, Gold Coin Grass, etc.The only good thing about this formula is that it's available on amazon here for about $7 less than I bought it for in my local vitamin store, lol."
4,"I take when I fast, and it works!","When I undertake a 3 day water fast, I take this product. I can tell that it is working because I feel like ""hell"" when it is circulating through my system. I also take the colon cleansing product, by the same manufacturer, before bedtime when fasting. Normally, I take this product upon arising. It is obvious when this product kicks in. I am not toxic and obese, so it has less obstruction to go through to be effective.Al emprender un ayuno de agua de 3 días, me tomo este producto. Puedo decir que está funcionando porque me siento como ""infierno"" cuando se circula a través de mi sistema. También quiero aprovechar el producto de limpieza de colon, por el mismo fabricante, antes de acostarse en ayunas. Normalmente, yo tome este producto al levantarse. Es obvio cuando este producto patadas pulg No soy tóxico y obesos, así que tiene una menor obstrucción para pasar a ser eficaz."
1,Not Worth the Time or Money...,"Although I rather enjoyed reading this author's book about Frank Sinatra some time ago, I can't say the same for this book. Not only is it a 'hodgepodge' of info. jumping back and forth from one Bush generation to the next; it is certainly NOT what I would callwell-written or edited. Ms. Kelley also dwells on the Prescott and George HW days a LOT more than the current President's life and career. Seemed like she was getting tired of writing the book, towards the end, last 50 pages or so, just 'wrapping it up' and getting it over with. Not a satisfying read, waaaaay tooo long and certainly not what I had expected, based on the hype about this book."
3,Easy but interesting.,"I'm not American, so had never even heard of Prescott Bush, let alone many of the other characters in this book. And yeah it's pretty gossipy and Kitty Kelley is obviously no fan, but if (like me) you just want an easy to read overview of the Bush family that doesnt get too bogged down in American politics, I say this is for you. I read every word and came out knowing far more about right wing American politics than I knew before. Let me tell you, it wasnt the Bushes that shocked me, (scratch the surface of any family and you're bound to find pay dirt) it was the ratbag right wing fundamentalists that really gave me the creeps.Oooooh, scary."
1,hated it,"I hated this book and the man too, what a waste on all fronts. What a lose to the American people that this person was ever the president, just shows we never really know who or what we are getting as president. I rarely give a one, rarely do I hate a book, I hated this one."
5,I thought this book was great!!!!!!!!!!!,This was the best book I ever read. I think everybody should read this book.I thought it should earn 5 stars because the marshmallow part was very funny.That's why I think you should read this book.
5,Shel Silverstein,"We love Shel Silverstein and are really excited about reading this book. We purchased it as a gift for our daughter, and know she will love it!"
3,"Sexy ladies, Nudity, Heavy Breathing, NO plots, Elevator Music","""Wham Bam Thank You Spaceman"" this was actually somewhat funny, stupid humor, nudity, heavy breathing over a soundtrack. The aliens were suppose to procreate, but they all just used there tongues calling it sex. ""Spacething"" basically, a man fantasizing living in another galaxy as an alien, getting it on with 4 sexy women on an enemy spaceship, nudity, heavy breathing over a soundtrack, again. ""Nude on the Moon"", two astronauts supposedly go to the moon and finds a nudist colony, thats it, basically, they walk around recording it and and go home, thats all. This was the late 60's; nudist colonies and showing them was fascinating back then, just boring now. If you like OK women nude a lot and heavy breathing scene simulation get this, otherwise theres nothing to offer. It still goes into my collection of SMV movies."
1,these batteries suck,"I have used the Delkins before- I am pro a photographer. The last time I bought one it was bad and to their credit delkin did replace it. This one won't hold a charge, I 'll need to replace it , deal with a return etc. Not worth the brain damage. Too bad the nikons are so expensive but you get what you pay for. Possible I received a counterfeit. I have been using the EN-EL 4 for over 5 years so I think I know what am talking about."
1,"Avoid Making My Mistake, don't buy this battery","I bought one of these at the same time I got my new Nikon D2X about a month before I left on a trip. I'm really glad I brought my charger, as I only got one use out of the battery. It didn't last anywhere near as long as the original Nikon battery that was purchased at the same time. Avoid making my mistake, spend the extra $$ to get the real thing. This version isn't worth it, even if they were offering it for 1/10 the price of the Nikon version."
3,A readable history,"This is a very easy to read book of Mennonite History. It was designed to be used as a text book in a high school or college setting. The stories are very well told, and very well laid out. The accompanied photographs and illustrations make it even more of a comfortable read. The authors are very informed about this area of study, and it shows through their work."
4,Excellent Overview,We felt this book would be a good read for someone who is converting from the Muslim faith to Christianity and is also looking for a church home in the Mennonite tradition. We have found the book to be a very valuable tool for this purpose.
5,Best Guidance for good health,"The video (and book) highlight benefits from Hatha Yoga and good eating and living habits that can be derived whilst living in a stress-prone world. With humbleness and wit, Ms. Welch guides the viewer/reader through an alternative way to fortify and strengthen the body, improve flexibility, and, soothe the mind. The excercises are isometric by nature and provide the fastest turnaround I've seen in any type of excercise regime (including triathlon training, aerobics teaching, weight-lifting and so forth).Really wish publishers would re-launch this work again as it is timeless and effective as compared to other tools marketed since that promise to do the same but don't.Ms. Welsh is inspirational in her postures and the tranquility she conveys throughout this work."
3,Good with modifications,"The service was very good - mine had scratch marks on it when it arrived, I wrote to the seller and they replaced it for free.Doesn't cut out glare totally, so I covered it with sticky shelf liner to make it opaque and now it works just fine. The material is not very strong though, so should be handled with care."
1,riped off,"Saw this on the the web site. Just needed something to stop the sun glare for the price I thought perfect, not paying ATT to shipping cost this item was sent by it self the cost for item 5.99 shipping was 8.99. You can hardly see through the visior next time I will check the reviews on any product I by and the shipping cost to make sure I don't get rip off again"
3,"Good product, but Amazon ships without handle","Good product -- this stuff is great to bind things together for packing and moving.I bought this one because it was advertised with a gripped separate handle, but Amazon didn't ship it with one. I needed it when I needed it and there was no way to complain to Amazon about missing parts. So be advised you may get something different than the picture. Amazon seems to have updated the pic and description since I purchased."
3,Acceptable performances but the film is not about the music,"Bob Fosse's film of CABARET trashed the original show,but in re-interpreting the material, he made a classic film-one that works as drama and only secondarily as a musical.Consider - he jettisoned the supporting plot of the musical playwhich contained all of the political points of the Nazi threat -he kept only five of the fifteen songs (with two more as back-ground music), added three new songs and dealt them out to only two singers (Joel Greyand Liza Minnelli each get three solos and one duet). The onlyreal joy here is the new song MONEY MONEY. If the film were notso good, the treatment of its music would have been unforgivable,but Fosse displayed his genius here, winning one of the film'seight oscars as Best Director. Only Minnelli fans and fans ofthe film need bother - the CD to get is the London cast recordingwith Judi Dench as Sally Bowles and Barry Dennen as the Emcee.Magnificent acting from all concerned."
1,Review for Cabaret cd,"Company did not send me the item that I ordered and paid for. They sent me an item similar to what I ordered. When they finally responded to my email, they informed me that the item I ordered was ""out of stock"" and that they would refund my money and allow me to keep the item that they sent to me in error."
3,Stick To The Original Broadway Cast Recording,I'm Sorry To Say That I'm Glad I Only Paid 2 Or 3 Dollars For This One The Original Broadway Cast Recording Contained Better Performances Of The Songs And The Song Married Was In English Another Gripe Is Sitting Pretty Was A Better Song Than Money Money And Is Only Presented As An Instrumental Here But My biggest Complaint Is Tomorrow Belongs To Me Which Is Completely Butchered Here Despite Adding An Extra Verse Get The Original Broadway Cast Recording And Hear It Acapella It eaves This Version In The Dust
5,A Delicious Protein Drink,I purchased these individual protein drinks after trying the two pound jug of the Mocha Cappucino flavor. They're so convenient. You can carry them to the gym or anywhere and just add milk or water. The chocolate flavor is delicious and doesn't have an after taste. The best protein drinks I have ever tasted. I stopped buying the SciFit brand and this is all I buy now.
5,Truly Beautiful!,"Having been a fan of Julie's for many years, I have been eagerly awaiting this CD for some time. It was defintely worth the wait! I can see why they have titled the CD ""The New Classics"", for each song deserves that description when performed by Julie. Many singers have fantastic voices, but I've found many of them sing as if they have NO idea what they are singing about. Sure, they reach in their vocal ""bag of tricks"", but in the end you're left empty. Not with Julie singing the songs! She pulls you into each song with her, and when she's done with you, you know that SHE knows what she's singing about! I highly recommend this CD if you want to hear a beautiful voice singing wonderful songs....with a true understanding of the lyric."
2,Be Careful When Purchasing,I placed an order and received only one hook - I emailed the company and that's how they sell them one per order. Doesn't make much sense since you need two of them to hang a pool skimmer. The company should include two hooks rather than just one. I am unable to use the hook unless I order a second one and pay nearly twice the value just to ship it.
3,It's OK.,I did get the other books. They are light reading and what you would expect for the price. The other books in the series rank the same.
4,Enjoyable -,Very enjoyable. I would read others from this author. I like the authenticity that seemed to be there throughout the reading of this book.
2,Suspenseless,I was disappointed in this book. I had to make myself continue reading and finally it gained my intereest but still not enough to recommend it to anyone else. Sorry!
3,Slow but built steam,"About 30 percent into this book in my Kindle, I thought, ""OK, the main character's charming, but where's the mystery?"" I decided I was interested enough in all the characters to give the book a little more time, and I was glad I did.This isn't a fantastic book, but it's a pretty enjoyable one. It captures New Orleans and its corruption and good ole boyness quite well. I thought Tubby Dubonnet was a pretty likeable character who was realistic when you consider New Orleans culture. And the rest of the characters? Most were offbeat and charming in their own way.I'd equate this to a Hamish MacBeth novel by M.C. Beaton. You read them because you find the entire cast quirky and fun, not because the mystery's hard-hitting and fast paced. And after a while, you realize you've read nearly all of the series."
4,Good lite reading,Pretty much what it seems like. The story is interesting and holds your interest. I liked it enough to look for more mysteries written by this author.
3,Original and Interesting,"Micheal Cadnum's book is well written, though I dislike when an author turns a genuinley creepy story into a movie-style ""destroy-the-monster"" climax. Some may taste spices of ""The Evil Dead"". Check your library system if one isn't on auction."
1,Terrible,"This is not the product it is supposed to be. The lotion has a weird smell to it, and it is supposed to be thick and creamy but it is thin and runny. I have ordered other Jason lotion from Amazon before with no trouble, but this order was TERRIBLE."
2,XXL classic??,"This album got a classic rating in XXL magazine and has received 5 stars by many reviewers. Maybe I was sucked in by the hype, but by no means is this a classic album. Several hardcore Clipse fans bought this album on the first day and shared my dissappointment. There are 5 really good songs on here (tracks 3,5,7,8,11), but the rest really aren't that great. I just can't believe all the hype this is getting through the net and magazines?? Are they listening to the same album? Clipse's mixtape ""We Got The Remix"" is 10x better than this. Check that out if you wanna hear some classic Clipse. In the meantime, look out for this cd used in a FYE or Coconuts near you....I already sold mine."
5,A hip hop classic,"The new clipse album is sick. I wish it had more tracks, but every track is tight so it wasn't neccessary. I hope it doesn't take so long for them to drop their next album"
4,hate or love it,"theres not much to say about this album so i'll keep it short & sweet. although not the classic i expected, it is a great album. if you like the neptunes you'll love all the beats. as far as lyrical content, it's the same coke rap, but i have to tell these guys are very clever w/ their tales of the drug trade. bottom line, if your looking for some bumpin', catchy hardcore hip hop this ones for you. if you're looking for some deep concious rap than this aint 4 you."
3,whyy?,"why do some people like the clipse so much? granted, they usually get laced with some of the darkest-grimiest Neptunes production, but their rhymes are so average and the subject matter so derivative (which can be said about most of rap now anyway).for you all out there who want to hear some dope street rhymes about slanging that white, look no further than Ghostface's Fishscale which just blew my mind when I first heard it. That IS a pure CLASSIC."
5,Recognize...,"Malice and Pusha T are lyricists! They've made a coke-ORIENTED Lp without sounding redundant from song to song & they remain on point dropping jewels throughout the most chilling/inventive production I've heard in a long time. While its arguable, Who made the best record this year? All will agree after listening to this that its definetly a contender for the title spot. Cop this, if not anything else...That's Real Talk. Peace!"
5,MR. ME TOO,"The Clipse are finally back after 4yrs and a label struggle that everyone knows about. They kept alive thru the mixtape circuit but this cd is hot from beginning to end with 12 hot Neptune tracks. With all this bubble gum trash out and I know everyone is tiring of leaning and rocking, hope the 4th quarter will save a down year for Hip-hop, with Nas and Jeezy also due to release and a lackluster cd from Hova. The Clipse rap style hasn't changed much since Lord Willin talking about tales of drug sales but Malice and Pusha T still drop a hot 16 on every track. If you don't have this cd, stop reading this review and go cop that joint."
3,"Some great beats, and some ehhhhh beats","Lemme start by saying that I don't really like the Neptunes all that much. Or maybe it's sort of a love-hate thing...Some of their beats, I really like. A lot of them, however, are just a little too hokey for me. Musically interesting, maybe, but hokey all the same.But they seem to save the best beats for the Clipse: the nasty, backroom-beatdown-type of beats that got them noticed in the first place; and the Clipse' rhymes float over and punctuate them perfectly.The formula works to perfection on the robotic-sounding ""Mr. Me Too,"" the spare, menacing, ""Ride Around Shining"" and the syncopated-yet-sinister ""Keys Open Doors.""There are also a few beats that just sound generic or boring, and all the clever crack-rap references? I mean, they're fine, but they can't save a bland beat.When 'Hell Hath No Fury,' is on, it's ON. But it's off a little too much for me."
4,"It's good, but not the best album of the year........","I mean I like this one right here, but it being the best album of the year, somebody must of been paid off, if it's like that. The album is solid and it deserves to be in any hip hop fans collection but remember there is better stuff out there."
1,OK Rhymes;Terribly Beats,The rhymes on here are decent and at most would give them probably a 3-star rating but add the Neptunes beats and it bumps it down to a 1-star rating. All the beats sound like Mr. Me Too (a drum beat with basically no other instruments). The only decent song is Sorry Mama. The worst song is Dirty Money and Mr. Me Too.* out of *****
4,"1+1=2, Don't Question the Formula","There's always something to be said about an artist that's able to expand and succesfully change their sound without compromising themselves. But, then, there's a lot to be said about the dudes that can remain the same and still sound fresh.Clipse definitely falls into the latter category. These guys spit about crack, money, and cars (woop-dee-doo, same ol' same ol') but unlike most of these MFers on radio, they're actually good at it. Charismatic, tight flows, sick punchlines (Even the title of ""Keys Open Doors"" oozes with wordplay) and sick beats. I'm not gonna say they've made a classic album because it all IS very repetetive but the beats are all solid (Neptunes comes through as usual) and the lyrics are all tight. If ya lookin for enlightenment and metaphorical bliss, look elsewhere (this album doesn't have that), but if ya lookin for entertainment, clever quips, and tight beats...look no further, ""Hell Hath No Fury"" is the album for you."
4,Intriguing,"This album strikes me after one listen as being cohesive from a production standpoint, with a sort of trip-hop sensibility, and the lyrical flow fits very well. The lyrical content is basic however: tales of drug sales, mysoginy and... oh wait, thats it... But a very good album nonetheless."
5,Best Album of The Year So Far,"And it's already November. High praise? Yes, but it's worth it. Recommended if you want a departure from the overly slick produced beats these days. Real street-hop here."
5,Pusha and Malice have done it again,The grimey beats on the album + the lyrical geniuses (Pusha and Malice)have impressed me with this album. RE-UP!
3,Now I see why I waited so long to listen to this 2.5 stars,"One of my guys suggested this album to me because it is a so called ""classic"" album. I've literally had the album for years and decided to listen to it because I was bored and wanted to hear some different music. Definitely differing from the majority I can not give this album 5 stars. Even though the kats on here can rap they aren't talking about anything worth hearing. There is an abundant amount of unbelievable cocaine talk and the beats are average at best. If these guys dared to step out the box of ignorance they would defintiely catch my attention and my dollar. But since I downloaded this album for free there is no loss to my pocket nor my hard drive because it wil be deleted now that I have listened to the album."
3,Great whirley gig,"What a great little sprinkler. It is hard to find in regular stores, but is well worth the postage to get one here. It waters very completely and evenly. It doesn't shoot so high that wind interfers with it. The only disadvantage is that it needs to pretty level for it to rotate as intended. I love BOTH of mine!"
1,broadway elevator music,"This CD is not a good one if you are looking for the tunes as you would hear them in the musical. Most of the songs do not have words and those that do are poor quality. Look for a Broadway CD that says ""original cast"" unless you want more of a background music collection."
2,Mostly disappointing,"""Cinnammon Roses"" is by far the standout in this thin little book and is one of the few stories that is actually erotic and interesting. The majority of the stories here are, unfortunately written with a heavy handed, unsexy style of clinical sex that is anything but what I'd term ""erotic"". Juvenile descriptions of faceless body parts entering other faceless body parts does not equal erotica. There was little story and even less characterization here and the ""vampire"" tales were mostly rehashes that have been done far better by other authors. My recommendation is to skip this one, save yourself a few bucks and if you're looking few a few chills and thrills pick up a Hot Blood anthology (edited by Jeff Gelb) instead."
2,Leaves a lot of room for improvement,"I have read this book, but while it was a simple read, it leaves a lot of room for improvement. Cinnamon Roses is the best story by far. The others, while interesting reading, are not all that well written. This would be a good book for your collection if you are a rabid fan of vampire stories, but if you are a discriminating reader, skip this one. Anne Rice's books while not overtly marketed as Erotica have as much sensuality as this, and a delightfully well done story line to boot."
3,Enjoyable,"If you are a vampire fan wanting to get your hands on more and more vampire tales, this one passes muster."
3,White Washed,"This katana cover isn't the best around, but it is one of the very few that is offered to the customers of the product. However, as fashionable as it is, and the color is nice, it is easily warped and when plastic that's been dyed is bent it turns white. This product turns white very fast. But only on the inside clippings. The outside is easily scratched, but i guess you can't complain much. Is mainly for fashion, and they do so, fashion has no mercy."
3,OK for the price . . . . BUT,"I suppose you can't complain too much for this price, and it is an OK little timer if you're not expecting great accuracy. But I have found, on several I have owned, that the running time is highly dependent on water pressure and flow rate, as well as age of the timer. They seem to really slow down with age - maybe this is due to the hard water in my locale - but after a couple of seasons they can really let you over-water. If your budget permits, consider spending a little more for a Gardena!"
2,Get a time based timer.,"This product does not work well with variable water flows. Underlow pressure it tends to not turn off. It is just not reliable enough to count on, and if you have to go out and check to see if it worked, what is the point? I think you will be better off with a timer that works with a spring, like an egg timer rather than one that works via water flow."
3,For BlackBerry 8100 only!,"Be careful! This skin is for the BlackBerry Pearl model 8100 ONLY. My wife owns a BB 8130, the recent model by Verizon. I ordered this one for it, but the holes are cut wrong. RIM changed the orientation of the camera lens/light/mirror on the back of the device for the 8130, and this one--cut for the 8100--did not fit. I had to send it back."
2,Okay,"The Water Blade works reasonably well on flat, or only slightly, curved surfaces, but not at all well on rounded surfaces (like fenders). The handle has no flex in it, which detracts from the blade itself. the MicroFiber towels are nice enough, but that's not why I purchased this item. After two uses, I decided to stick with my chamois. I wouldn't waste the money."
1,unusable,"I would give this product no stars if that were an option. The design is just horrible. The picture doesn't show that the inside is made of some kind of RUBBER that goes directly against your skin. It was terribly uncomfortable and made my skin break out in a rash. I tried wearing it over a thin long sleeved shirt to get some protection, but the shirt just bunched up and still irritated my skin. And of course the item is non-returnable. So buyer beware! I have tried several other wrist guards and while the quality of the others varied, I can EASILY say this was by far the WORST. I literally threw it away after 2 uses. It just wasn't worth the discomfort."
5,The perfect first book.,"Dorothy Seymour's book ""The Tent"" was the first book I ever read. I remember very clearly flipping through the bright green and black pages, reading each word and then finally reaching the last page. I was amazed that I had actually read the book myself! Now, I'm sharing this wonderful book with my kids. They get to follow Ned, Nell and the rest of the children to the eventually overflowing tent."
2,dont know if it actually works,"I cant honestly tell you if this actually works or not. you spray it on and you don't feel anything, not that you have to but there's really no indication if its working or not. all it really is, is salt water, so i guess you could try your luck at making your own salt water solution before spending your money on this."
5,Cheap and Useful,"I bought this after getting my upper cartilage pierced so that I could clean my ear when traveling etc. I was going to buy it from h2ocean's website but saw it was like $12 dollars with $5 shipping which is way to expensive for a tiny bottle of salt water. I found it on amazon for much cheaper and although I was a bit worried it would be fake, it's not, it works very well and I use it often, especially when I am too lazy to make a sea salt soak. Definitely get it here because it is so much cheaper!"
5,good product,Got it on the estimate date! It works wonders and I use it more than 6 times a day. I recommend this product to anyone that has piercings because it works for everything.
3,not sure if this actually works,"perhaps i'm using it wrong, but i don't feel like it's doing much for my cartilage piercings. it feels nice - maybe i'm just not using it right."
4,WORKS,IT REALLY WORKS WELL BUT IT DRIPS MORE THAN ACTUALLLY SPRAYS AND I USE IT FOR MY NIPPLES SO IT GETS EVERYWHERE
4,Spray,I just love this spray it really help my belly piercing.I had a infection I used this for less thanks a week in my belly piercing was in great sharp.I will recommend this product to any one with piercing. I will buy again
5,Keep it clean!,Product works well to fight infection and for such a small size it has lasted me a long time two weeks of 2-3 times a day use and now once weekly.
3,Very good but runs out fast,"I liked this product alot, all you do is spray a little on your piercing and your good and you could bring it to school and do a quick spray before you go to class to keep piercing clean if you needed, you can bring it anywhere and use it at anytime, it works great~ but the only thing I didn't like is that I ran out very fast. May be because it's so small or maybe I used to much? I don't know. I ran out within 1-2 weeks of having it. I cleaned my piercing 3-6 times a day. Used too many times? Sprayed too much? Or maybe theres just too little that it comes with. But either way, the product was great and it came within 3 days of ordering. Recommended, but get the 4 oz package. ~~~"
5,Remember,"This just doesn't have good old recipes, it has wonderful stories to go along with them. Makes a person homesick for that period of time when there were good cooks, good stories, and a loving family.Anyone from Kentucky will love it"
1,Not very helpful,These plastic bags don't last and are very small. My dog had trouble eating on the plastic dog plate.
1,Not a comfortable shoe,"I like Etienne Aigner products, have a pair of boots and wallet I love...but these shoes started killing my feet after only one hour of wear resulting in painful blisters. I did try these on in a store and liked them, then saw them here on Amazon for about half the retail price. I might take them to the shoe maker to see if they can do something, but I doubt they will ever be wearable. Glad I did not pay full price, especially since it turned out to be a waste of money."
4,Very Educational,"I liked this book a lot. When I told some of my fellow Pagans what book I was reading, I got quite a few looks...but the looks were worth it, because this book is really very educational & I liked it a lot. If you're looking for spells & Sabbat rituals, this isn't it. But if you're looking for something to read that doesn't have a ""get rich quick"" spell in it, this book is for you!"
4,Problematic but worth every cent,"There are a few turns of phrase and comments in this book that don't ring quite true, but on the whole it is a decent book.It must be read in the context it was written in, however, and that makes it a bad book for the rank amateur.However, if you've been practicing or reseaching a while, this book is just the thing to gauge your beliefs!It probably should be in every Witch's library, just not the first book on the first shelf."
5,Witchcraft and wizardry: The Compleat history!!,"This is a wonderful book, ridding the curious reader of all negative ssterrotypes of ""Orgiastic Satanism"" ,""Perversion, and ""Cannibalism"". Valiente tells it like it is (and was). Doreen covers all the nescessary history of the ancient religion called ""Wicca"" when Politically-correct,new-age-type stuff is added to it. This book talks about Duirwyyd (Druid) connections with wicca, the adoration of trees,Phallic worship, and the ""Eastern links with European witchcraft' section is very informative and surprising."
5,Watch history. Be moved,"This is a fantastic investment in time. Powerful story that was more than 60 years in the making, brilliantly told and a must for anyone even with a casual interest in the history of the Greatest Generation."
2,"Started out OK, but got really stupid.","I liked the idea of some nerdy guys banding together to form their own frat, but this one ended up with the nerds becoming every bit as disgusting as the low-lifes who were popular! In the end, the message this movie seems to send is that even nerds can be jerks if they try hard enough!Another point --- would Booger REALLY be a nerd at an average college? He seemed to me to be more like the kind of guy who would be persecuting nerds. College is full of beer-drinking, burping, low-life ""party-dudes"" like he is portrayed to be. As for the gay black guy and the brainy kid, I seriously doubt they'd feel right at home with the Nerd frat, either!"
5,This is a hysterical movie.,Anthony Edwards is a great Gilbert. This movie will make you laugh. I would recomed you rent the un edited version of this movie rather than watching it on television.
3,I laughed like hell...and I'm ashamed I did,"Because alienation isn't funny. This film may well be a pioneering work in the now-predominant field of putdown comedy, but it's built on a false premise--that the misfit can still triumph at a young age. And it implies that there's a ""quick fix"" for what is actually a flaw in human nature curable only by time. A lot of it. It takes getting just a bit older than most of the characters here before ""normal"" people come to realize that what's wierd about the ""wierdos"" doesn't mean Jack Squat in the scheme of things. You don't do it during the semester with a boffo performance in a talent show!"
3,Very juvenile but curiously amusing,"It doesn't exactly challenge your intellect, but Revenge of the Nerds is a strangely satisfying movie. You find yourself wanting to watch it again even though you know the plot is silly and the characters are unbelievably two-dimensional. Perhaps it's those sorority girls... Historical footnote: it was forbidden to import this movie into the Soviet Union when it came out in the 1980s."
4,Sit back and laugh your head off,"This is one movie I'll never tire of seeing. It's a classic tale of not getting mad but getting even with a range of colorful characters. There are virtually no repeatable lines but who can forget the tricycle race with the words to ""Daisy, Daisy"" being sung in Japanese in the background as the racers slowly get more and more drunk. Brilliant!"
4,One of the funniest 80's movies....,"REVENGE OF THE NERDS,is certainly one of my favorite comedies, packed with a hilarious castincluding such rememberable characters as of course LEWIS and GILBERT,( played remarcably byAnthony Edwards and Robert carradine.) BOOGER,( played by 80's second string brat packer CurtisArmstrong; RISKY BUSINESS,BETTER OFF DEAD etc...)LAMAR,( played by I never saw him again. Of coursehe's the token black man and happens to be Gay.Double-wammy right there.) POINDEXTER,( UNABLE TOname him either although he's been in many others.) the JAPANESE GUY , the LITTLE KID, andwho can forget HEAD DEAN AT LAMBDA,LAMBDA, LAMBDA,( BERNIE Casey.) It's a comedy joyride I won't soon forget. Thank you NERDS."
5,CHRISTMAS IN NEW ORLEANS - it'll SEND ya!,"Bought this in 2003/same cover/same artists/same tracks - diff title ""The Christmas Collection"" and diff order of songs?! Weird! Awesome collection of Christmas songs. Who needs the norm, anyway? Exceptionally clear recordings. I love Cool Yule. This cd goes on when I'm home alone & want to SING OUT LOUD! You will too. Add this to your collection."
4,Party Hearty With Louis & Friends,Every singer and big band on this cd makes a fine contribution to Louis Armstrong's holiday cd. My favorite tune here is May Everyday Be Christmas by Louis Jordan & His Orchestra. This guy really rocked! An extremely enjoyable album you'll want to listen to long after the holiday season ends.
4,my wife loves it,"My wife picked this out, at first on the apple store, and as a apple ""fan-boy"" I almost bought it, but then I saw that they won't sell the complete album, you have to buy each song, which would dive the cost of this album to about $15. what a rip off, not to mention inconvenient, so I came to amazon and found the album for less than $10.. sold! 4 stars because there are a few tracks on there that I would rather skip."
4,An inspirational book about overcoming obstacles to love.,"This book is an easy page-turner right to the end. Mr. Allen's simple, straightforward, and thoughtful style is refreshing. What starts out as a fun trip, becomes the beginning of an odyssey that changes his life. Not as flashy as ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"", but just as entertaining, made all the more so because it's true! I recommend that you give this book a read."
3,Not Very Good,"As a die-hard fan of this band, I would say that this is not a very good collection of their songs to start with, first off, this has the song ""Phaorahs"", which has it's own bussiness being on another CD and not really being on a ""Best Of"" CD. This CD also leaves out a few of TFF's early hits-Pale Shelter and Mad World. The way that this collection is thrown together says that it's best to buy their 1992 hits collection."
5,Jaw-droppingly good!,"If you loved ""Fire Logic,"" this next book in the series will blow you away! If you weren't sure about ""Fire Logic"" . . . well . . . ""Earth Logic"" will blow you away! EL makes FL look like a five-finger exercise, with Marks now coming into her full tremendous power as a world-builder, myth-maker and geographer of the human heart.I know that Ursula K. LeGuin is a fan of Marks' earlier novels - I don't know if she's started reading the ""Elemental Logic"" series, but I believe that fans of LeGuin who've read her books ragged will find a new author to love in Laurie J. Marks."
2,Wasn't the one I ordered...,"The quality of this blanket was very nice, but unfortunately, it didn't have the cars on it like in the picture and I was super disappointed. I had looked high and low for this exact cars blanket because it is my grandson's favorite sleepy time blankie and his original was in bad shape."
4,Almost Perfect!,"I agree with the last review. Had ""Cryin' in the Rain"" been included, this would have been a perfect compilation. As it stands, I prefer it to the ""Greatest Hits"" version as I think the song selection is superior. Thankfully, the god-awful ""radio mix"" of ""Here I Go Again"" is deservedly replaced with the album version instead."
5,Comprehensive guide to keep by your side,As a sales training consultant and communication coach I am always looking for the best thinking on the topic of selling. The 10 Immutable Laws of Power Selling is a comprehensive guide on today's best practices. I particularly like the way the book is organized. It is a great guidebook for those new to the sales role and can be a great reference tool for the seasoned professional looking for quick reminders.
5,A beautiful exhibition catalog and far more!,"This is a real sleeper of a coffee table book for basket makers, collectors and enthusiasts of this craft in particular or the arts in general.It accompanied an exhibition, but offers much more than great color photos of an amazing variety of approaches to the craft by really top people.There's a history of modern basket making, lots of 2-page ""Artists' Voices"" (picture/philosophy combos), and specialized chapters on 8 different techniques.If, for inspiration or reference, you want a knockout survey of the most wild and gorgeous art pieces being made today, this is your book!"
4,Not Bad,"Or should I say - the music is ""BaD"" - I really dig this CD - sounds to me like Led Zepplin took a few hints from Ike...."
4,Doesn't get better than Tina!,"The song Bold Soul Sister popped up on my iPod today. Toward the end of it I realized,"" Holy Smokes, that's Albert Collins playing solo guitar fills"". He's unmistakable. Even though he's not credited on the CD it makes sense because I believe Albert put something out on Blue Thumb too. True story: when I was a young lad (14 maybe) I helped move equipment for an Ike and Tina show. I sat right by the side of stage. This would have been about 1970. At one point during the show somebody handed me Ike's Strat....I couldn't resist strumming a chord or two on it. He had the action set low!On a side note, in the new Wayne Shorter bio there is a crazy story about him walking into his house to find Tina, the greatest rock singer ever, scrubbing his floors. Read the book for the details.PS Check out the non-Phil Spector River Deep, Mountain High on the EMI Best of Ike and Tina Turner..stunning vocal track!!"
3,for the diehard fans,"I'd say that you have to be a real Tina Turner diehard to appreciate this one, or perpaps more curious about hearing her and Ike covering some blues standards. This compilation of their recordings for the Blue Thumb label in the 1970s is fair to good, just nothing particuarly exceptional. It's like they ran out of original ideas for new songs, so they decided to have a go at some old blues tunes. Sorry fans, but this one didn't excite me much at all."
1,Poor quality control,"The first one I bought lasted about 3 months before it stopped working. Rather than paying the ""warranty processing"" fee and shipping, which together would have equalled the cost of a new one, I ordered a second. It did not work at all. One defective unit might be forgiven, but a second indicates poor quality control. I returned it for a refund and will try a Schumacher, which has the added feature of adjusting automatically to 6 or 12 volts."
1,Not working,"Purchased this in 2009 and used it for about 5 months. It was working fine until the light went out and the charger quit completely. I tested the charger with a volt meter and there are power but it won't charge the battery at all. (I have tried various methods to ensure positive engagement). Finally, I connected the battery on Schumacher SC-600A charger and it worked.I have read review and someone has written that it will cost him 16 bucks to have the battery charger send in and returned on a 25 bucks charger. Save your money and spend it toward something more dependable and no headache. We don't need to be belittled by company that won't stand behind their products.I have more to write but it is not nice so I won't write it."
1,Deltran 021-0127 Battery tender,"The product did not work out of the box, no lights no voltage not anything. Very disappointed, I read some negative reviews about the product before I purchased it, shame on me"
2,Does not work as advertised,"Was hoping the chargers I ordered would work as advertised, but am very disappointed. They never charge to a point where they switch to green, indicating that the battery is charged. This happens not only on one battery, but two chargers on two separate new batteries are operating the same! These chargers were purchased on-line at Amazon."
1,Defective after 3 months,This item was Defective after 3 months the red light flashed but no charge. I would not recommend this to motorcycle owners. Get a similar charger from Harbor Feight for under $10.
4,6n volt charger,"An excellent product, easy connectors, and simple to use, keeps battery fully charged, the only con is the fact that it will not charge a fully discharged battery, there must be a minimum of three volts in battery before it will work,Amazon delivery was somewhat tardy, sixteen days to Canada, otherwise good satisfactory service,Well recommended"
1,Didn't work,"Have to send it back. It doesn't charge. Hopefully they won't give me any crap. If they send me another that works, I'll rewrite this review...lol"
5,Deltran Battery Tenders,Ease of operation and installation. Standard shipping was even faster than anticipated. Builds charge fast.
5,battery tender,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PERSON WHO LIKES TO GET IN AND GO KEEPS BATTERY AT PEAK CHARGE AND KEEPS THE AUTO READY WHEN YOU ARE.
5,Battery Tender,"This tender does a good job of keeping the battery charged. It takes quite a while to charge a very low battery, but if the battery is only down a little, it does a great job. I use it on a boat and others on model t fords."
5,Hong Ting plays so well,Hong Ting is a very talented artist. I play this CD at least once per week in my workplace. The music is so serene and beautifully played. I wish I could see Hong Ting play live but I don't know where to look.
2,Very Weak Hooligan Pulp Fiction,"YET ANOTHER SLIM attempt to update the pulp fiction stylings of Richard Allen's ""Skinhead"" series, this is only slightly less clumsy than Gavin Anderson's weak Casual (also published by Low Life). Here, there's a small town skinhead hero, his small skinhead football hooligan crew, a beautiful and willing new girl, the obligatory fight and sex scenes, and no development of any kind. If you want authentic pulp fiction, stick to the master: Richard Allen. If you want interesting fiction about football hooligans, stick to John King's impressive trilogy (The Football Factory, Headhunters, England Away) or Kevin Sampson's Awaydays."
2,eventually broke me out,"I have been using this for a couple weeks now, and so far no miracles. It made me break out, badly, on my cheeks and chin but mainly my chin. It hasn't calmed down yet on the chin area, even though I have stopped using the product. If you have sensitive skin, don't use this product! Otherwise, Mario Badescu is a lovely company with good customer service, try there other products, but skip this one!"
4,Mario sent me a gift with purchase,Bought this product after using a sample. Like the fact there is glycol acid in the cleanser. I also bought a moisturizer but it came from another vendor. Mario sent me a gift with purchase I didn't even know I was getting a gift. It was three 3 oz products in a travel case plus 3 smaller products. Nice touch. It made spending that much dough on a cleanser almost tolerable.I like the cleanser. It may be too soon for my review as I have not been using it long enough to know how effective it is. works as well as a cleanser should.
4,Heaterd hand mits,I bought these for my husbands hands to help relieve his arthritis. He say's they do make a difference. I like them but it would have been nice if they we're lined with cotton or something instead of the plastic or vinyl material.
1,not as pictured,curtain looks completely different then photo. the colors look like a rainbow. its also very bright.
4,like Mel Gibson movies,"I don't have many Mel Gibson movies, but when I saw one of his earlier movies available I wanted to add it to my collection. This movie demonstrated a different acting style then the later action parts that he is more famous for."
4,Young Mad Mel & the Cougar!,"I purchased this movie as a gift for my spouse [Mainly because I ""accidentally"" disposed of an old VHS copy]. It's actually not a bad Australian film.PROs:Great ""Date Night"" movie with your significant otherYou get to see the young Mad Mel before he played Max in the Road WarriorPiper Laurie & Mel Gibson have great on-screen chemistry [Long before the term ""Cougar"" was invented]Great direction & storylineCONs:The 1979 Australian fashions are datedIt was not a high budget filmNot a lot of money went into remastering it [one star taken away]NOTE: I find this film an interesting curiosity because I love the George Miller Mad Max films. It is tolerable romance-drama that is much better than most of the garbage Hollywood is churning out today. I highly recommend it!"
3,Great movie - Bad sound quality,"The movie itself is a fine film, it closely follows the storyline of the novel by Colleen McCullough.However the sound quality on the DVD is bad, very distracting when watching the movie - hadto constantly adjust the sound."
5,Very well done,This book does an excellent job of covering the important aspects of datawarehousing and walks you through analysis services in a clear and sensable way. It is very organized and covers important topics. It is not exaustive coverage unfortunately but for what it is it is fantastic.
4,A Good Book,I recommend this book because the author distinguishes multidimensional concepts and the OLAP tool.Gab.
3,Some examples doesn't work...,I will say this breifly:1. You are not going to learn more from this book than from the books on line included with sql server 2000.2. The fact that the example of writing a cube from Excel didn't work makes me feel complete frustration. It was the reason why i bought this book.However the book is not bad if you are new to olap technics. It is a good introduction.(...)
1,Lacks the Details,"The book skims over Analysis Services. Case in point: Nowhere in the book does it cover the unary operators and/or how to apply them to create custom rollups. Actually the term ""custom rollup"" is not even mentioned in the book (though it is a key term for Analysis Services).Knowing what I know now, I wish I'd saved my money."
3,Analysis Services,"This book is very basic and should provide a good foundation for those people who are not familiar with SQL 7's OLAP or the newer implementation called 'analysis services'.It is easy to read, the examples on the cd work perfectly and the tutorials provide a good overview of how to create your own cubes.It's pretty thin and after reading through the first few chapters I found myself putting it down and just diving into designing my own stuff with microsoft's interface. It's a very logical application and with little or no resource materials people could easily figure this out with the tutorials included with the software.This is not a good reference book, though I'm at a loss as to what would be a decent reference book on this subject since it's one of those things you either know or you don't.MDX is VERY thin, and since you can teach the basics to yourself, a reference/primer book on MDX may suit you better."
2,Not what it needs to be,"This book shows some basic examples by mousing through the menus with a pre-cooked script, but the on-line tutorial does about the same thing. However, there are no explanations why one would select one option over another, no explanations about how to construct different cubes to solve problems and no explanations about the syntax of Analysis services. There is no overriding theory presented that allows one to gain an understanding about how to frame and solve problems using Analysis services nor about what kinds of problems can and can't be solved. After reading the book I have a high level understanding about potentially what can be done, but I have not gained enough information to build anything useful."
3,Defective reproduction,"The hardcover publisher, Amereon House, obtained an original 1943 vintage printed copy having the corners of some pages torn off and reproduced it without regards to whether there was text missing from those torn pages. I wrote the publisher about 2 months ago a letter by US Mail sent to their Mattituck, NY PO box asking for them to simply provide me the contents of the missing text so I could at least pencil it in and they have not responded. Clearly they do not stand behind their work. (Had I done this project, I would have researched the missing text and transferred words or letters from the printed text to fill in the gaps with the same type style and formatting.)Bottom line - while the story was entertaining, I recommend you purchase a different printing than that of Amereon House."
3,Miss Silver Deals with Death: A Miss Silver Mystery,"Miss Silver Deals With Death: A Miss Silver Mystery is a good mystery. I really love the Miss Silver mysteries.. If you're not already a Miss Silver fan, you probably won't finish it. But if .you are, a mediocre mystery is better than none. I'm about one fourth of the way through. I may change my mind shortly."
3,Issues with pills this time around,"I've ordered this item two times now from amazon. The first time everything was perfect and i found that these were the best value per capsule.When i ran out, i ordered them again but this time i've had issues with them. The problem is that many, if not most, of the pills have a crack on the end and thus causes it to lose a bit of the powder in the bottle. The problem then is that i dont get the full dose in each pill and also i start to taste the powder. It's not a huge deal as i'll probably only be losing a bit of the dose and none have lost more than about 1/5 of the contents of the pill."
1,very cheaply made,"These boots fell apart the second time I danced in them. The upper separated from the sole. Every time I buy a pair of Pleaser shoes or boots, this seems to happen. On top of that, the toes are extremely narrow and pinchy. I give up on this brand entirely."
2,Should have bought a piston pump??,"I have had the unit for 1 year now. I use it for weed and poison oak control with Roundup.The unit worked very well last time I used it, now it does not pump properly.I did leave some Roundup in it the last time I used it 2 months ago; normally I do clean it after use unless I plan to use again soon. In this age of plastic and synthetic I am quite surprised that the membrane can not take chemicals very well. The piston pump does not have a membrane so would probably do better.The membrane kit is $19.95 and very difficult in my opinion to replace; this indicates a poor design, meaning, It should be a simple thing to replace something that you know will have to be replaced.I bought a Stanley backpack sprayer, will report later on that one."
1,Don't lose sales slip,I bought one of these and it worked great...one time! When I tried to use it the second time the pump was frozen and a plastic piece that attaches the handle to the pump broke. I took it to a Solo approved repair shop and since I couldnt find the sales slip they wanted $140 to fix it (I only paid $70+ to buy it new). I called Solo and emailed them and they said they would take care of it but they never did. Now I have to buy another new one (I don't think I'll get another Solo). Very poor customer service but it did work great the one time I got to use it!
1,What a disappointment!!,"This backpack sprayer is literally a piece of junk. We used it one time and the plastic strap buckle broke. The pump does not create enough pressure to to spray properly, the liquid just trickles out. We bought this particular sprayer because our previous Solo sprayer lasted six years with only minor problems."
2,professional,Good sprayer but very difficult to repair. Engineers who designed this must be laughing out loud. Not meant to fix.
2,SRT 4 LeBra,Amazon is becoming eBay. They sent a returned item that was previously installed and was missing pieces and ripped from previous buyer. It's dirty to list something new and sen them a returned item.
5,Ralph Laren Polo Sport Woman,"The product that I bought from amazon was excellent, the product was received in perfect condition (perfume called woman by Ralph Lauren) and it was not a copy cat perfume."
1,Bogus product,I received the product as promised. I have used this perfume for over 4 years and this recent purchase does not smell like perfume. It may not even be perfume. I am sending this product back. I will buy direct from the manufacturer. This should have zero stars.
1,minus three stars,most tracks occupy a musical spacesomewhere between pure garbage andoutright disrespect
3,Read before buying,The only type of guitar this stand will hold is a first act discovery. Standard guitars will not fit. It will do the job if you have a first act though.
5,Facinating Man,"John Edwards is a facinating man. I find his show very intersting and entertaining. I am a bit skeptical, but heck, there is nothing wrong with questioning things. Still, perhaps his gift is indeed real. And if he can communicate with those who have crossed over wouldn't you want to know what it's like? I know I do. This book is a page turner. Whether your skeptical or not. Another book with spiritual theme that I would recommend is I Talked To God And He Wants To TAlk To You. I love exploring the unknown. And if you do as well, then you will like this book."
2,Disappointed/not what expected,"I, too, was hoping the book would share actual stories like ""One Last Time"". I was highly disappointed as I could not get interested in how the show ""came to be"" and how the ""guides"" helped John make decisions regarding the show. Quite frankly, after reading this (well, I couldn't even finish it), I am under the distinct impression that John is a sell-out and wrote this book for pure self-promotion and, obviously, profit. I think a lot of his fans, like me, were really yearning for some more stories about his psychic connections."
5,Experience Crossing Over!,"Wonderful! I received my copy of John's book on Tuesday and was finished reading Wednesday. A quick read that brings the reader behind the scenes of John Edward, his TV show, the people he works with, the people he reads, the people he communicates with who have ""Crossed Over."" Anyone who has followed John's rise to fame for his extraordinary abilities will find this comprehensive book rewarding and stirring. For those who are non-believers or are new to John and his amazing works, stand back and prepare to be thrust into a new dimension of reality. A reality that anyone with an open mind can't help but find totally believable and mind blowing. John Edward showed up just as we all were in need of some verification that there is a home for all of us with our deceased family and friends when we ""Cross Over"" to the other side. Thank You John.C.M. Braun/St. Louis, MO"
3,"2nd Nonfiction book-a real ""review"" of the first and then some.","John Edward's second nonfiction book is in part a review of a significant amount of material in the first book, ""One Last Time"". It refers back to information in the first book and in some instances provides more information. This book basically follows the birth of the TV show ""Crossing Over"", hence the title. I guess the real downer is that the show is not as available, if at all, now.The technical angle with names of producers and people who were responsible for the TV show's birth and the winding path to air date are ALL described in detail. That's where this book lost my interest. It is an interesting read when it showes how John touches lives and shows validation of the other side."
3,Interesting - but not what I hoped for.,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. It bills itself as ""the stories behind the stories"", but mostly it's about John Edward's career as a medium and how he got started in television. I was hoping that it would be more about the stories of the people he read, and of the spirits crossing over, rather than about him. Sure, there are some compelling stories, but that's only about 20% of the book. The other 80% of the book is more of a behind the scenes look at his career."
5,One of the best,"When I started to read this book I was amaze with it.I love when he talked about Elvis and other stars.When I finished reading the book I told My freinds to read it, because it made me feel like I was there with everyone in the book."
4,Amazing,What an insightful book! Hard to describe...you need to read it for yourself and then make a decision!
1,fan of john edward show not book,"i'm a fan of john edward and i watch as often as possible. he gives so much of himself to help others heal. i could not finish this book. i went half way and put it in my ""get around to it"" pile. john's gift is one on one interaction."
2,The hype was a little too much for this book,"I'm a regular watcher of John Edward, but unfortunately the hype overtook this book. It's like his life memoirs but he has only been doing Crossing Over for a short time. I found the book a little arrogant"
4,unfortunate,"Unfortuntely I haven't recieved my copy to be able to review, I'm still waiting, even though I purchased the audio tape in July."
4,INSIGHTFUL AND THOUGHT PROVOKING READ,"OK SO THIS BOOK WAS NOT ONE LAST TIME - IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE! I FOUND CROSSING OVER - THE STORIES BEHIND THE STORIES A GREAT READ. IT GAVE WONDERFUL INSIGHT TO HOW TELEVISION SHOWS ARE PRODUCED AND WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THEM ON THE AIR, ALONG WITH THIS YOU GOT GREAT PERSONAL STORIES AND READINGS! I ENJOYED CROSSING OVER THE SHOW AND LOVED READING ABOUT ALL THE BEHIND THE SCEANS GOINGS ON! I LIKED THE FACT THAT YOU GOT TO READ ABOUT THE STAFF AND ALL THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THIS VALUEABLE SHOW TO MILLIONS OF VIEWERS EVERYWHERE. I WISH THE SHOW HAD BEEN RENEWED!"
2,Hmmmmm,"This book while well written is not exactly beleivable. John Edwards seems to target people when they are most vaunerable and makes them believe. In a way this is not all bad, he does give them some closure that they would not nessesarly have even if there is no aspect of reality in it.Overall I found this whole thing rather sketchy and wonder what the appeal is."
2,This book is NOT what the title suggests,"John Edward is an excellent psychic HOWEVER, this book is about how he got his television program and NOT about spirituality at all. More about his ego and how many people he had to get to know to make it big. Sadly, he states in his book that he would never charge prices based on what the market will bear - but his private readings are $750.00 which means he has given into the mercenary side. My goal was to study metaphysics and spirituality - and this book is about how to get your own television show. I'm not sure how many people who wrote reviews actually read it to the very end.Save your money."
2,not a favorite,"I didn't realize that this book is mostly about Edward getting his show on TV, sometimes in excruciating detail. The first 60 pages contain a less detailed autobiography than the one which can be found in ""One Last Time."" The rest is all about his rise to success and I could really not care less about that. ""One Last Time,"" although not successful when it first came out, was much more interesting - all about his development as a psychic/medium, his eventual adopting of it as a career, what he actually does in a reading and a number of stories about people he has helped. Although ""One Last Time"" is apparently out of print, there are still plenty of copies available online, and much more worth your time and money."
5,Crossing Over,"This book was a well thought-out and moving account of John's experiences as a medium, and what its like for him to be a medium. I alternately welled up, and laughed aloud. John is a compassionate, funny individual who is committed to helping people, and getting the messages from beyond across. This was an honest and informative read. Loved it, John--Great job!Please keep up the excellent quality of your work, and continue to stand behind your convictions. It is appreciated and recognized! Thank you."
5,YOU ARE KIDDING!!!,"Now that i have your attention, from a small town just south of Sydney in NSW Australia, i was amazed to see the show begin only a couple of weeks ago. I fell in love with the concept and the truthfulness of the show. 1 week later my wife bought me the book... Funny, witty ... JE has an amazing gift... even the sceptic that helped write the book with Mr Mcgee (JE's real name) was ""turned"" so to speak.THis book is uplifting and a peace maker at the end of the day. A book you can run your life on. There are peices that relate to most life situations. John has a million hidden meanings in his stories... and he lets us not so smart people in on some of them.Loved it... Whens the next one due... When r u coming to OZ!!5 stars!!!"
5,Crossing Over,I could not put the book down. John has validated what I have always wished was true. Having cancer - losing 3 friends all within months to this disease - it's comforting to know that they are still around me. He is simply fasinating to watch on the television as well as to read his books!
4,"Good book, but...","Crossing Over is a good book to read if you are interested on how the show came to be. It lacks the touching stories that were in One Last Time. There are a few updates with some of the previous stories in this book, but I was a little disappointed on the context. I guess like John Edward says on the show, I should have checked my expectations at the door. All in all, it is a good book and anyone who is a fan of the show would appreciate the struggle it was to get the show on the air."
3,Skeptic,I thought that the book and the way it was written was interesting. I don't believe in what the book talks about but I did find it interesting and entertaining. I just wish that more of the mistakes that Mr. Edwards makes were televised. It must be nice to have a great editor to edit out your wrong guesses. Overall I liked the book but I don't believe in this hooey.Reader in Chi-Town
5,Another Success for John Edward,"I just finished reading ""Crossing Over"" and must tell any prospective buyer to get it! Anyone who read his first book ""One Last Time"" will be equally impressed with the stories in this book and learn about John's personality. It has many humerous parts in it. This book takes a look at his climb to television and John even takes a few jabs at the cynics. Great book!"
1,A total disappointment...and I was a fan!,"If you've read at least one book on the afterlife, YOU KNOW MORE than John Edward does. He describes spiritual matters like a high school student writing a termpaper on a topic he hasn't researched enough. From a person with several years of psychic work behind him, this was very disappointing. He either has nothing to say or he simply doesn't know what he's talking about and is trying to [immitate] it. In either case, he is an extremely poor writer and he didn't hold my interest.A couple of the anecdotes were slightly interesting, but most of it is just pointless fluff, in my humble opinion. If you want personal anecdotes of a psychic medium AND some basic info on the afterlife, James Van Praagh's first book is a much better choice."
5,EXCELLENT READ !!,I have read all of John Edward's books and this one is just fantastic. A great insight into launching his career and TV show. His fun personality really shines thru in his writing style. I just love reading his books.
5,Crossing Over the Atlantic,"Having watched John's show on cable, I have found him to be inspiring. This book is everything his shows are - genuine and to the point. It shows a side of the medium few are fortunate to discover. The narrative is strong and the words echo John's commitment and strengths. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough."
2,Crossing Over,"Crossing Over was purchased thru Amazon and the service and delivery were great, however, the book wasn't. It was mainly how John Edward got started and then maybe got too big for his britches, I felt he was bragging a lot and didn't care for the book, although I did like his other one."
2,Not what I wanted,"This book was not what I wanted, it was not really a spiritual guide or share, it was commercial and about competition and efforts to get media coverage."
3,Love John Edward but...,I enjoy John Edward especially his TV Show BUT I didnt like this book a whole lot. I do think it gives a good bio of who he is and how he got 'started'. I was expecting something a little different I guess. But I am still a fan of his and always will be!
3,Funny & entertaining but not technical,"Perhaps I don't mean ""technical""...I was looking for a book that described more about crossing over and the science (or lack thereof) of mediums but this book was entertaining, poignant, and uplifting as well. Well written in first person with a casual style."
1,Crossing Over by John Edward,"I bought this book on the basis that it was identified by Amazon.com as being in the same category as the James Van Praagh books. I was deeply disappointed. It is primarily a book about how the author played the media game to become ""famous"". Who cares about all that ""hollywood"" stuff? It is very short on psychic content and spiritual insight. It does have a few touching scenes."
2,Disappointed,"I loved ""One Last Time"" and I really enjoy John's show so I couldn't wait for Crossing Over to come out. When I picked up the book and read the back cover, I couldn't wait to get home and start reading. I was disappointed though, the book says, ""the story behind the stories"" which leads one to believe it was about the 'behind the scenes' stories of the readings he has done on real people. This book seemed just like an autobiography of John and how he got his show. I do like him very much but really didn't expect to read about how many TV show executives he went to and how many meetings he had to have in order to get his show. Don't get me wrong, the book was not a total disappointment, maybe it is just the way the book was marketed. I really enjoyed One Last Time for it's spiritual content, however this book seemed less SPIRITUAL and more COMMERCIAL and that is why I was DISAPPOINTED."
3,An interesting book for the skeptical,"This is the first Edwards book I have read. I must confess that I remain skeptical, if less so, perhaps, about the claims Edwards makes. Nonetheless, the book is entertaining and engaging. It points out the trials one who is challenging conventional wisdom must face, and does so in a mildly sarcastic, but charming way. It is one of the few books on such topics that does not cast the protagonist as a messianic zealot, but simply a person with a gift that is desired to be shared. For that, the reader should be grateful. The book narrates, and does not proseltyze. The person who loaned it to me is, of course, a believer. I cannot share that belief, but at least the book made me more open to literature on the subject, and for that reason, I would recommend it."
4,Good Read to much Repeat,"I have read all of John Edward books since the sudden passing of my 26 year old daughter 2 months ago. One Last Time was a great comfort to me and has helped with the devestating grief. The beginning chapters of Crossing Over is not well written and to much repeat information. The second half is excellent. I too expected more real stories of people making contact with the other side. I was disappointed by that, but I enjoyed the book. I have read many books on grief. Is there anything new out there? Is there anything that deals with losing a grown child. I can't find anything that is written from this prospective. Any help with this would be appriciated. Enjoy the book."
5,Story of the author and the program,"Crossing Over was not quite what I'd expected it to be. I guess I'd expected more readings and the personal stories behind them. Instead the book is Mr. Edward's own personal story, especially his growing mediumship and the development of his program also entitled Crossing Over.While I don't necessarily believe in mediums, and I'm not entirely certain I believe in an afterlife, I have to give the man kudos for the obvious sense of closure that he bestows upon those who attend his shows, seminars and individual sessions. From the book and the snippets of show I've seen, it appears that, contrary to his detractors, the man really does believe in his work and is not a charlatan. The skeptic may maintain that Edward reads the living rather than the dead, but the average person with a sense of spirituality who is suffering with the pain of loss will probably find Edward's words far more consoling than those of the skeptic."
3,GET TO KNOW WHAT HE CAN REALLY DO,"Okay, so John is admired by many and questioned by just as many. But I re-read the book after I read the Afterlife Experiments by Dr. Gary Schwartz in which John Edwards is validated. He took part in some fascinating scientific tests done in the lab at the University of Arizona and so one can better believe his charming book. Mr. Edwards is better ""seen"" in this book than even on TV...but don't miss the book about John and other mediums in The Afterlife Experiments. I am wowed by the findings and the people courageous enough to explore this space. Yes, read this book and the Schwartz book and enjoy your thoughts."
1,Disappointed,Bought this book as I thought it would be talking about Crossing over and the usual stuff John does but the whole book just talks about how John got to where he is today. Boring and not what we brought it for.
3,"Too Dry - I want a wider variety, different experiences","John is a good writer, and communicates well on this side besides the other side! What I think is lacking is a broader scope of experiences. What other authors, like Tiffany Snow and Sylvia Browne are doing, is touching many aspects and challenging the reader to do the same, BESIDES telling the personal experiences. Too often, John just tells his own stories, which are entertaining, but limited. But, this book I like better than his other one, ""after life,"" which is more of the same and even dryer than this one."
4,Filling the gap in peoples lives,"John's book is a must for both the believer, and the sceptic. He brings feeling, and joy to the reader, and also great peace of mind. Hopefully one day he may come to Ireland, as he has a huge following here. Maybe one day, who knows ????"
3,Trouble,"The trouble with Edward's book is not in his analysis, but in his subject matter. He babbles about as if there is some kind of merit to what he is asking.The questions themselves are fine, as the meaning of life's nuances are worthy to be pondered, but, not unlike Deepak Chopra, he comes at it as if there is no truth, and then postulates his own truth.I give this book three stars only because it might challenge more open-minded thinkers to read a deeper book afterwards..."
1,wake up sheep,"My goodness, how John Edward changed my life. First he told me how I had someone close to me pass away once. How did he figure that out? He is not of this Earth. Then he told me how my grandfather misses me very much. Profound!!! By the way, to get one hour of programming they have to edit out about 3 hours of his ""misses"". He's a fraud, a huckster selling snake oil. If only it was harmless. But naive people put actual stock into what he does. To take advantage of people like this is disgusting and low. So make your money now former ballroom dancer turned psychic. I just hope it catches up with you."
1,disappointed,"I love John and his show, but this book was a bust. I don't really care about show biz, but I do care about hearing stories of hope. This book seems like a marketing ploy than a serious book. Write another book about your WORK john!"
3,This is where it all begins.,"Rene Goscinny, Asterix the Gaul (Orion, 1961)The very first book in the Asterix series, Asterix the Gaul basically serves the purpose of introducing the various characters and setting up what would be, in essence, the plotline that the next thirty-two books have for the most part slavishly followed: there are Romans. The Romans want to capture the Gaulish village. They can't, because the Gauls are invincible. They come up with a plan and attempt to implement it. Asterix and Obelix foil the plan (normally through no fault of their own), and the Gauls celebrate once more.It's fun stuff, if you remember them from your childhood, and the new Orion editions are very nicely printed; if you've never done the Asterix thing before, however, depending on your age, you may want to skip it. It does get repetitive, and the jokes are mostly puns. ***"
3,o.k.+,"Not as good as the last compilation but still worth having ifyou're a Bloodshot fan.Favorite song: Two-Way Action (can someone recomend an entire CD of this stuff?)Least favorite: There's a few that are even worse than my local country station plays, and they're not even being ironic!Well, that's probably too harsh. I'm still ready to move to Chicago."
3,"Not the pro it claims to be, parts very expensive","Sprayer is generally sturdy but it has several issues:It is supposedly designed for solvent based materials. We used it with a concrete sealer. The trigger handle got frequently plugged, pain in neck to take apart, clean it etc every 20 minutes. The tip is the worst: it gets crushed during the adjustment (the part which screws over the tip regulates how fine the spray is), and the damage is irreversible.We ended up ordering 6 spare tips, but - surprise, each tiny tip is 7 dollars!!! The hose collapsed after several hours of use (i.e. the solvent softened it to the point that it no longer retained its original round crossection, it kinda folded and kinked). Replacement hose was 14$, 20 $ including shipping!!!I think the sprayer belongs to the category Mickey Mouse it.would consider buying a professional model for the next job."
3,Not the sprayer pictured,"The sprayers work well, but the 2 I received are not what is pictured. The sprayers I got are a newer model, but the older model which is pictured is of a better quality."
2,Disappointed,"When I started reading the book pages started falling out. I should have known. Not a great fan of the story. The best part is when you are able to read what the dog is thinking, and there is not enough of it!"
5,Wonderful Rice!,"First bought this rice in Montana & loved it, then found out no place in Iowa carried it so was thrilled to find it on Amazon! Cooked with raisins, this rice makes a tasty breakfast or sweet rice but its also just as terrific in soup! Nice texture & flavor. I'm hooked & now I'm getting all my friends hooked on it as well!"
3,Good Rice!!!,"Tried this rice, recently. Find it to be good! It cooks up well in our rice cooker. Taste and aroma is nutty and full-flavored. Great mixed with different rices. Very filling, too. It has an interesting color, reddish-brown. Worth trying for a little variety. Need to use a little less water than usual, for this type of rice."
5,Delicious for Baby!,We made homemade rice cereal this morning for the baby (6 months old) and he loved it. Sweet and nutty flavor.
4,Great alternative to brown rice,"This is a great alternative to regular brown and white rices. Good source of fiber. Following the cooking instructions produces a sticky mess, do a little bit of less water and use the very minimum flame."
4,"Very good, but not her best work","Sandra Benitez continues to evolve as a writer, and has certainly avoided the trap of writing the same book over and over. This novel begins in the American midwest, and with a much more conventional feel then her previous works. But it then move into Mexico, and starts to pick up the latin magic of her earlier books. The story also becomes deeper and more nuanced, and thereby more compelling. Always marvelously written, by the end the story is a compelling mixture of midwestern solidity, psychological insight, and Mexican mysticism. It combines the very American dissection of a family gone bad with the overlay of latin magic revealing the facts. This helps to maintain the uncertainty about the outcome and the sense of discovery much longer than a more conventional American novel would have. This was not the Benitez work I liked the best, but it is an enjoyable read."
3,Good file cabinet,"I was looking for a file cabinet that could look more like furniture. This does the trick. First one arrived broken, Amazin picked it up and replaced. Although it was a major pain trying to put all the pieces back in the package. The new one has a minor problem with the glides and gets off track sometimes. Otherwise, pretty decent and the best looking one I could fine without breaking the bank."
2,"this flavor too salty, try chipotle","I first bought Chipotle flavor and love that one. That is my favorite flavor. The Gouda flavor is much too salty for my taste, so I will not buy this flavor again. The quality of the popcorn and amount you get in this product is excellent. I will be trying other flavors in future, just not this one."
5,Holy Cow...so good!,"I recently tried Oogie's Smoked Gouda, White Cheddar, and Sundried Tomato popcorn...WOW. I've never tasted anything like it! Very tasty with just the right amount of salt. And to think these snacks are heart healthy. My kids loved Oogie's! It's great to have such a healthy, delicious snack to feed them after school. I will definitely buy Oogie's again and serve at parties, too! If you love popcorn, do yourself a favor and buy this stuff."
5,Engaging heist novel,"""Fever,"" the debut of author Sean Rowe, is an engaging heist novel in the tradition of Elmore Leonard and the film ""Ocean's 11."" It's a fast, fun and funny romp through South Florida that makes for an ideal late-summer book.Its lead character is a former FBI agent working as head of security for the world's largest cruise line. When his stepbrother arrives on the scene and blackmails him into helping out with a plot to hijack a cruise ship (which is conveniently carrying a fortune in drug money), his already disappointing life takes a turn for the worse.""Fever"" has plenty of action and a nicely twisted plot. What really distinguishes it, though, is the author's way with characters and his ability to make these flawed people both human and sympathetic. That is the sign of a gifted writer."
3,Good thriller,Enjoyed my first Sean Rowe novel. Once I got to the halfway point the action really picked up. Couldn't stop til the end.
2,Predictable Plot,"Just finished listening to the full audio version (unabridged) of Fever by Sean Rowe. The concept of hi-jacking a cruise ship should have lead to an exciting thriller, but, it didn't. Frankly long and rather dull with a simple and predictable plotline."
4,High quality Sprayer,"Compared with cheaper models, this sprayer belongs to other universe.It's very light and handy.Highly advisable.Goodbye and greetings."
4,Good Value,Unfortunately I have only been able to use this on a limited basis as the type of spraying I need to do requires an average amount of rainfall and we are currently in a severe drought. I did use it when it first arrived for about two three hour sessions and have been very pleased. It functions just as I had hoped. I recommend it.
2,Pressure pump replacememnt fiasco,"Although Solo sells a replacement pressure pump for the 425 and 475 backpack sprayers, this part is not replaceable even by someone with above average skills and experience. The repair shops refuse to work on these sprayers or want to charge more than a new sprayer costs. A good sprayer, but not repairable except for easily accessed o-rings and washers. Sorry Solo. I need something for the long haul."
5,Great sprayer,"I live in the country & have 2 acres. I spray weeds, bushes, wasp, etc. In the past it got old spraying for 2 minutes then stop & pump for 1 minute. This is the best sprayer I've ever had. Works very fluent and doesn't take a lot of pumping like the traditional non back pack sprayers. I sprayed 2 houses & 4 storage rooms effortlessly and within minutes. It has the power, durable, good pressure, & range (distance & width). I have fallen in love (shhh don't tell my wife). Great investment worth every penny. As long as you flush your system with water after each use this sprayer will last several years in comparison to buying a new cheaper one every few years. It pays for itself."
5,great customer service!,"I bought one of these backpack sprayers last year (not from amazon). I worked mostly well last year, but by the end of the summer the sprayer valve was not working perfectly. This spring I tried to use it. The spay function worked well, but unfortunately the valve would not turn off. I was not too happy about this.I called Solo through a number I found on the website. I never got a electronic operator. A person answered after 4 rings. I gave a brief description of the problem. She said she would connect me with the repair person. She came back after about two minutes and said he had stepped out and would be returning soon. I was sure this was the first step to a brush off, but gave my name and phone number. Thirty minutes later I was surprised to get a call. I gave another brief description and was told the solution was a new valve.I gave my name and address. Two days later I received a new valve at no charge to me.I will definitely buy another product from them!"
1,It doesn't work at all,"It doesn't work. It looks cute; makes a whirring noise and DOES NOT KEEP ANYTHING COOL EVEN, let alone keep it cold. I have even tried taking frozen soda in with me in the morning...by noon, it is room temperature in the mini ""fridge"". Don't waste your money. It is a rip off."
1,"Not a mini-fridge, Not sure what it is","Be warned. This is not a refrigerator though the packaging and the description here call it a ""portable mini-fridge"". Indeed it is technically not refrigerator at all since it does not have a condensing unit but uses some type of capacitors to make the temperature inside the box a bit lower or higher than outside of the box. It doesn't really cool things and it doesn't really warm things though it is also described here as a ""Cooler Warmer"" That seems a bit more accurate since it can cool things a bit and warm things a bit though it certainly cannot cool a warm can of Coke to drinking temperature nor heat up a can of soup. The best description of this thing might be ""Device that somewhat slows the warming of cool things and somewhat slows the cooling of warm things.""You don't need this."
3,"Cute, lightweight, but not a fridge.","I ordered this to use in my classroom. It is very lightweight and easy to carry, especially with the handle. But, you should know it isn't a fridge. It only cools things 20 degrees below the temperature of the room. If I put warm soda in there, it gets cool, but not cold. However, when I put a cold soda (from my fridge at home) into it, it keeps it very cold. I still like it, but it is something to know."
1,Mini Frig,"This is a waste of time and money! If you want to cool a drink fine, it will not chill anything! The coldest it will get is about 20 degrees cooler than room temp. Do not buy this item!"
1,Do Not Buy This Mini Fridge!!!!!,"I bought this mini fridge based on the reviews and the size of it but I was highly disappointed. It BARELY cools the items in the cooler and there is no temperature setting to make it colder or warmer, just a switch ""cool,off,and warm"". Also the company will charge you a 25% restocking fee to return the item so that means if you choose to return it you are out $22.50 plus the cost of shipping it back which will probably cost 22 dollars as well. So now you are out 45 bucks at least. Trust me do not buy this product."
2,Just Wasn't Interesting....,"I guess some books click with readers while others don't. As much as I loved THE STONE MAIDEN, and WAKING THE PRINCESS (her 2 best works) I found this book to be SO boring. S.K. has given us dull spots before in novels but they are often saved by the characters, but not in this case. The entire book was dull. I tried and tried to get into this book in deference to the author but it never drew my interest. This one dragged AND was boring. (Sorry)"
3,"Great, but......","It got lost along the way. It was great 2/3's of the way into it and then I lost interest. The characters were perfect and well defined, but Ms. King tends to turn her romance novels into historical action thrillers near the end. She lets go of the romance and completes the tale of Scotland vs. England. I gave it 3 stars because the first half of the book deserves it.I wouldn't buy this one - look for it in the library."
2,A little slow,"Average romance novel, but a great historical accounting of the conflict between England and Scotland during the late 13th century.I was really disappointed in this book because the plot had so much potential, and the characters were truly likeable. The novel had all the right elements, but the writing itself never captured my interest. I found the book slow and plodding with very little energy, emotion or excitement. It worth a read if you want to learn some interesting Scottish legends, history and folklore, but pass if you want a lively romance novel."
4,"Very nice, compact laptop case","Purchased for a 17"" laptop, fits perfectly. Simple compact design with enough storage for the charger (a bit bulky with it in the pocket). Easier to carry than a full blown laptop case. Very well made in keeping with Lowepro's quality. Protects the laptop from minor bumps, perfect for carry-on. If you need to carry other accessories, it might not work for you, but for the essentials it is great."
5,A personal favorite,"Batman: TBatB is and excellent throwback to the Silver Age. Some of the episodes, such as ""Game Over for Owlman"" are truly exciting and funny. This is the Batman Adam West made popular. This is the Batman on the other side of the spectrum from The Dark Knight and Batman:TAS. While both were great, this Batman is a welcome breath of fresh air."
4,a retro look with a current appeal,"i am a big fan of batman, and i love his animated works.this latest,the brave and the bold is interesting. all the heroes and villains in this series have modern attitudes but have a costume throw back. lots of one liners and jokes abound. it is a hidden gem for true fans of the caped crusader."
1,Just like superfriends,"Batman: Brave and the Bold. I gave the show one star because there isnt a no stars button. I have watched 3 of the shows now and i cant say i am impressed. The series is not keeping up the Batman look and feel of the last few series.BBB, has the same look and feel as the old 60's kids show superfriends.It is inane and childish. Batman has a running mental commentary in every show. Not to mention that they are all calling each other ""Old Chum"".The drawing is flat, like a cheap old comic book too. I am not sure what they were trying for here but it is not worth watching.Pathetic"
3,A Pretty Decent Group,"38 Special is a pleasantly surprising good group. It's hard to really classify their brand of rock, because although it has some Southern Rock influence, it has elements of pop in it is as well....And just as a little tidbit of information, this group hails from Jacksonville, FL and the lead singer is the brother of the late Ronnie Van Zandt (of Lynyrd Skynyrd). I would have to say if there was a downside to this group, it is that many of the songs do start sounding the same after awhile. But many of their biggest hits like ""Caught Up In You"" are worthwhile to check out. Overall they are a talented group that somehow never got as much recognition they deserve."
4,Chilling read.,If you are a fan of crime drama you are sure to enjoy Scenting Evil.The story is fast paced and I found it to be very moving and exceptionally chilling.Worth picking up a copy.
5,"the future of detroit techno, indeed..","matthew dear's audion guise gives us nasty, massive techno that scorches a path through the wires..i heard 'the pong' at a club last year and was hooked immediately..i promise youve never heard anything quite like this.definitely recommended for fans of alter ego, t raumschmiere and the like, and worth it for 'kisses' and 'the pong' alone."
2,Satin Smooth Double Wax Warmer,"Works ok, have used for a couple years now. It has always had an issue with getting too hot during use for some reason, even if you have it turned down really low, I think the thermostat is very cheap. Better than nothing, but it is cheap for a reason. Get better quality if you can."
4,Should be in every thinking person's library,"This is an excellent book. Other 4 and 5-star reviewers have already pointed out almost everything I could say here.However: since it deserves reprintings, the author may consider, in future editions, expanding some sections.Ghosts is a case in point. Though he demonstrates that the most famous poltergeists (Amityville, the British Rectory) were hoaxes or scams, evidence by enumeration of examples does not on itself demonstrate the impossibility of ghosts. Countless examples do not preclude an exception, and a believer could argue: ""ok; those cases were not real, but what about my story?""In my view, general, universal arguments to posit the ""incoherencies"" in people's belief on ghosts should be added to the chapter. (For example: are ghosts incorporeal? Then, how do they move objects? Are they ""solid""? Then, how do they go through walls?)"
1,LAME. Glad I didn't buy it.,"I'm glad I got this book from the library, instead of paying for it. I liked the idea of the storyline, with the main character following random people to see what they're like. I thought this would lead to some interesting characters and perceptions.However, I found the book tedious to finish. I found myself saying, ""Oh, come on!"" The main character does some really unbelievable things, like letting a small girl come into his apartment and even taking her to the beach without the mother's knowledge. Get real! Who would do that in real life and not get arrested?!Also, the book tries to take too many twists and turns. I guess this was supposed to make it exciting and interesting, but I found it lame and predictable. Boring. Did I say tedious already? Made myself finish the book, then wondered why I wanted to torture myself!Save your money. Borrow it from the library if you feel you must read it."
1,Terrible,"Sedgwick's character is a perverted boring loser. Worst book I've ever read--well, almost read. Talentless. End of story."
3,Page-Turning Fun,"Did I love this book? No, but it certainly kept me up past my usual bedtime for a few nights trying to read another page because, no matter how predictable or coincidental the plot sometimes seemed, the story was voyeuristically compelling and rarely boring. I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates a fresh mystery (although I kept thinking of David Lynch's Blue Velvet, especially early on). The characters were pretty well drawn and I rarely wondered what their motivation was, which I think is key to this type of novel. Don't expect The Dark House to win any literary awards, but don't be surprised if the person on the beach next to you this summer gets sunburned because they don't want to stop reading long enough to put on sunblock."
5,Bears repeating often,You'll never get tired of listening to these renditions of the music of the Band
3,3++ Better than expected but nothing like the originals.,3++ Better than expected but nothing like the originals.
3,A little disappointing,"It's always nice to hear a new spin on things and some of the interpretations were nice - took the songs to a little different place. With that said, I was a bit disappointed in the overall CD. I hold all these songs in such high regard, which sets the bar pretty high in terms of hopes and expectations. I'm glad it's in my collection, but it's not going to be on ""A"" rotation list for long I'm afraid."
1,Wasted Efforts,"Most of the songs on this album are lifeless, note by note renditions of the originals. There are a few exceptions. Steve Reynolds has an interesting take on Stage Fright that brings a different nuance to the lyrics. Rosanne Cash nails Unfaithful Servant and Jakob Dylan's version of Whispering Pines is right on target, too. The Roches, while covering the song pretty much by rote, bring a treacly sweetness to the lyrics and in doing so leave out the sense of dislocation.Amongst the rest, Josh Turner, Trevor Hall, Bruce Hornsby, and Guster all range from downright terrible to terribly disappointing. I can't help feeling that another group of musicians (Tweedy, Farrar, Cary, Adams) would have done a vastly superior job.Buy The Band's boxed set instead!"
4,Endless Highway-a good buy,"If you are a fan of The Band, Bob Dylan or Modern Country, this is a good updated listen to some songs that represent one of the roots of today's sound. Along with Gram Parsons and The Flying Burrito Bros., The Band was a seminal force. These updated covers are generally great.Dave Smith"
2,Why Bother,"While some of the performances are good, why bother listening to this when you can get the original? Unless you are giving a song a new spin, I just don't see the reason to redo it and copy the original??"
5,Tribute to one of the greatest rock bands ever!,"This tribute is long overdue, but turns in some outstanding renditions of the Band's most popular songs. Among the best are Widespread Panic's rocking version of ""Chest Fever"", The Allman Brothers Band's live cover of ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"", but perhaps the best song on the entire CD is from My Morning Jacket, with their version of ""It Makes No Difference"". This is a really great CD."
5,Consistently excellent tribute,"There seem to be a plethora of tribute albums coming out over the last few years -- record labels seem to be trying to milk every excess dollar they can out of their catalog. So it's a welcome relief when the results are as consistently excellent as this collection. Every song on here seems to be labor of love -- from Lee Ann Womack's sweet take on ""The Weight"", to a powerful ""Chest Fever"" by Widespread Panic, to the Allman Brothers doing justice to ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"". Even the weak points of this album are still as good as anything that's come out lately... this could be the Americana album of the year."
3,"""A Few Good Songs""","My Morning Jacket's take on ""It Makes No Difference"" may well be worth the cost of the album, and the body of work captured in the disc validates the powerful and influential song writing of The Band. Unfortunately, the disc is a collection of artists whose interpretations may find you fumbling quickly for the skip button as the performances range from pleasant, to dull, and then irritating. Now you'll have an incentive to sit down and learn how to create a play list for your player."
4,This book,"This book is a must read for those who plan on reading the Friends Forever series. I gave it four stars,because they shouldn't have put it all in letters and diaries,but it explains how everyone in the club quit except the original 4. I think it was nice that the original 4 were together,so I rated this four stars. I hope you bookworms like me out there read this!"
4,A GREAT start!!!,"I have been a BSC reader for years now and have read most all of the previous books in the series, so this was a surprise. I enjoyed it alot but thought that it could have been better by adding Abby and Jessi's point of view on the whole situation since they were two major parts of the book. But other than that this book was excellent, and I think that this new series will be excellent!!!"
3,It sure was a change!,"Although this wasn't my favorite book, it sure was interesting to read about all the BCS changes!!!!! Ms. Martin kinda rushed things by getting rid of most of the club in one book, but this fresh start sounds really cool!"
5,It's about time!,"When I first heard about this new series, I was estatic! The BSC is FINALLY growing up! It's about time! I can't wait to read the upcoming books and find out what happens! I'm really glad that the girls will finally be moving on! Thanks, Anne!"
5,Foyle's War soundtrack,"Great music.. Jim Parker is an amazing composer! Foyle's War is a favorite of ours... we're looking forward to more Foyle, more Jim Parker!"
3,This writing hits you like walking into Steel Blast Furnace,"I was particularly attracted to the title, and the first of this collection of stories concerning his mom being a weightlifter, that is carrying huge burdens for children, their faith, well-being, etc. This was the best for me out of this, which progressively wore on this reviewer.The style is grating after a bit, but does raise one's sensitivities a great deal with the staccato scene shifts, in and out of someone's reality, etc.One can only pause at times and breathe deeply, as this writer certainly has a way with getting across emotions which most of us think continually, yet never broadcast nor write down all of them as this does.Some left me in a daze, e.g. where did the jumpshot come from."
1,Not a good martial arts adventure,"This book was stupid. For one thing, it had almost nothing to do with Tae Kwon Do or martial arts. It was just a lame adventure about the CIA and a lunatic South Korean military leader who wants to take over North Korea. Emphasis on the word ""lame."" Save your money for Master of Kung Fu, Master of Karate, or better yet, Master of martial arts. Two thumbs down."
1,Whaaaaa???????,"This book was really weird. No matter how hard I tried to make good choices, I just got killed or something. And there's isn't any Tae Kwon Do!!! Not to mention it was just plain a snooze to read. I should know. My brother owns a copy and I once borrowed it for a road trip. Good if if your absolutely desparate for reading material..."
1,poorly designed,"The knob on the bottom of the blade, used to adjust the desired slice thickness, gets in the way of anything that is sliced. I tried slicing potatoes, but they would get caught in the knob every time. Don't buy this, the XO one is much better."
1,annoying,"I agree with the other comment about the knob being in the way of the sliced food. This creates jams immediatly, and clearing them out takes more time than just cutting by hand. It baffles me that this product was engineered so poorly. I thought it would be great because of the brand. I'm going to take it back and try the OXO one. I don't expect a lower priced mandoline to work miracles, and I know they can be tricky to use, but this one straight up doesn't work."
1,And plastic in your food...,"I agree with every negative comment above. Here's one that I didn't see yet: Some of the little spikes on the guard are just a hair too long, so that they break off and land in your food when you get to the end of whatever you're slicing. The good news is that the blade is so dull, you'll probably have given up on the machine long before you get to the end of whatever you're slicing. What a sad waste of money."
1,huge disappointment,"Cuisinart should discontinue this product. Husband bought for me thinking the stainless steel and Cuisinart name would be a good combination. Not so. It's unstable and difficult to use. We've tried several times and after over 1 year of trial, I'm tossing it out. It's just taking up space."
1,Flimsy,This product is the quality of what you'd buy at the dollar store! The first time out we tried to slice a sweet potato. It was so hard to slice the sweet potato that the holder broke!!
4,The only positive feedback...,"I have never used a mandoline before, and while it didn't come with detailed enough instructions, i used it for the first time on 4th of july and it sliced my onions and tomatos perfectly fine saving me a LOT of time in the kitchen. I haven't been able to try it out with tougher veggies or the julienne blades but my over all expectations are still high!"
1,Worst product ever!,"All I wanted was to slice vegetables, this product is incapable of doing so in ANY capacity. At first I thought, ""maybe I need softer vegetables"", but carrots, onions, bell pepper? Nothing slices in this waste of space at ANY size. I have never in my life come across such a poorly designed product. I trusted Cuisinart and now have lost that trust. I would not send this to my worst enemy. This is a tool of the Devil. I would not use this to prop open a door. I would not use it to signal a rescue plane if I were stranded on a desert island. I would burn it with fire if I didn't think it would ruin my fireplace like it ruined my dinner."
1,a waste of time,"This is the 2nd mandoline I've purchased. The first one was a plastic $20 ""As Seen on TV"" model, and it FAR surpassed the Cuisinart. The stainless and plastic Cuisinart came with no directions, but having had a mandoline before, I knew how to use it. It immediately and repeatedly jammed, and shredded the plastic nibs on the guard as well....it shredded the plastic nibs better than the jicama I was working with, and shredded them so finely that they shavings could not be picked out of the jicama. I was so disgusted that I threw the whole thing away rather than wasting my time washing it to be able to return it. Don't waste your time! I'm amazed that Cuisinart released this product without better quality control."
1,Not worth the $; worst kicthen apparatus that I've ever purchased,"I would not give this product one star, but you have to at least provide one star, so that is the 'default'. This product is a huge disappointment. It is hard to use and you can only slice baby carrots and celery length wise as it is not engineered correctly; the carrots slip and fall down length wise when you try to slice them and then when you do slice them length wise, you only can slice 1/2 of the baby carrot leaving the rest stuck in the food handle and it is not setup so that you can slice the entire baby carrot. What a waste. There also needs to be a 'blank' or 'fill in' where the julienne blades are to be inserted as the slices just get caught up in the gap. It also does not feel very stable when you use it; you have to press down so hard to make the cuts and that is not a good thing when you are working with sharp blades."
1,Don't Buy Cuisinart,Cuisinart Hase the worst customerservice dept ever refused to honor warrenty acuseed me of useing product comercialy and would only fix if I paid a fee almost equal to a new machine. Don't take a chance with Cuisinart
1,"Overpriced, doesn't work...","You might think that with this price tag and the Cuisinart name that you'd be getting a good slicer by buying this product. You'd be wrong. It doesn't cut well at all - simply breaks harder vegetables like carrots. It's simply not a good product - I don't recommend you buy it under any circumstances.For 20% of the price, a Progressive makes a nice mandolin slicer that actually works."
2,Looks good but not equal to cheaper plastic units,Would not slice sweet potatoes as the cutting blade is not sharp enough. Adjustment of opening does not stay the same while cutting carrots. Pretty poor product for the price. Only positive factor is that it is easy to clean because of the use of stainless steel components.
1,Absolute Junk,"Given the high-quality food processor, blender, cookware and utensils I own that are produced by Cuisinart, I am amazed that they would put their name on this product. I would give it zero stars if possible. I found slicing cabbage, onions, bell peppers and carrots impossible with this slicer. This slicer simply will not slice. In order to make it half way through an onion slice, I would have to position my palm behind the onion and force it, exposing my hand to the blade. This product is ineffective and UNSAFE. DO NOT PURCHASE IT!!!"
1,Simply doesn't work very well,"... for any but very small vegetables (cucumber, celery, small zucchini). Anything larger keeps slipping off the gripper. The knob in the middle of the reverse of the blade gets in the way of anything with a diameter greater than a cucumber, so forget slicing onions or tomoatoes. It seems almost completely unable to cut any vegetable with any density, so forget slicing potatoes or carrots. It collapses regularly, so be very careful because the blades are sharp enough to give a nasty cut. I threw mine away after trying to use it 5 or 6 times. Bad design, poorly executed. I'd give zero stars, but I'm not sure it would register."
1,Frustrating and aweful,"This is so poorly designed that I am suprized that it even made it on the market. It isn't even useable, vegtables break off before they are even sliced. Don't buy"
5,Great! I really love it.,Really love it. It's not too large but not too small. Go great with casual dress during this spring and summer.
3,Should have been a short story,"I suppose this book satisfied my need for a Lindsay fix, but I won't be re-reading it anytime soon. It's a short book to begin with, but seems to have been stretched out to fill a ...price tag. This book could have been good with a secondary story line involving either the heroine's friend or cousin (or both together).Definitely don't pay full price for this one. Try the library...I guess any Lindsay is better than none, but this one isn't much better."
2,Not worth the effort,Called all over town to get the book on the release date - should have waited for the paperback. Ms. Lindsey has obviously lost her touch. Not enough interaction between Melissa and Linc and way too much with the 16 uncles and Linc. Wait until you get to the ending - you will not believe what you read. I will think twice about buying another Lindsey hardcover.
2,Not worth the $5-- borrow it from the library if you must,"I agree with other reviewers, that there really is no relationship here. They decide they are meant for each other after a 5 minute conversation about not much of anything. The writing doesn't make up for the lack of interraction between them. The ""passion"" falls flat and most of the book is taken up with a drawn-out conflict about whether or not the hero is crazy. What's crazy is that this book took over 300 pages (paperback), and that I read the whole thing. This reads more like a Harlequin romance, all fluff, no substance, and no charisma or sensuality."
1,Really really terrible,"Embarassingly bad. Tried to give zero stars, but the review wouldn't take it!"
1,The WORST book ever,"This is the worst book i've ever read. Don't waste your money on this book. Even though, the book is bad, it's overpriced too."
1,DONT READ THIS BOOK,"Ok I must say that I love Johanna Lindesy's books, however her newer ones lack the flare I think they should have. The whole situation with this book is the 16 uncles hold a grudge against Lincoln because of something he did when he was 10... 10 for the love of it all. This book has no flare and I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money or time on this book. The only reason I can come up with as to why this book was even published in the first place is bacause it is by Johanna Lindsey. This book could have been better and I know Johanna Lindsey can do better then this."
2,Either JL did not write this or she needs a rest!,"I have been a long time fan of Ms. Lindsey and has read ALL of her books. I must say the best ones are the first ones. Lately the books have been mediocre. I have been thinking along the lines of maybe she's not writing them anymore to ""her books are getting bad lately"". I was not surprised when I happen to see several reviews of The Pursuit and found my sentiments mirrored by other fans and readers of Ms. Lindsey. I long for the humor and shining characters of her old books."
1,Definitely not her best,"I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to read this book, wait for the paperback! The Pursuit doesn't even come close to Johanna Lindsey's other stories. The characters immediately like each other and want to marry - boring. On top of that, the focus of the book is the feud between the uncles and Lincoln. Unfortunately, the basis for the feud is lame as well. Melissa MacGregor's character seems under-developed throughout the book. She almost seems to be a minor character next to the uncles. There isn't a real pursuit in the book - just a few obstacles (uncles) along a relatively smooth path. This really was a hard rating - I own all of her books and have never rated any of them below a three - I rated this one a one. Johanna - If you need to write a story about previous characters, please return to the Mallory's."
1,Where's the magic,"I've had to give a one star rating, but really it didn't deserve any - it was dire. I find it hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as the Mallory series, Once a Princess, a Priates Love, Fires of Winter ... etc. The Heir was the start of the rot, but this has taken it to the pits. Can I wait to borrow from the library in future? I have all her other published books as I have a psssion for owning and rereading them not to mention getting them to read as soon as they're published, but in future I'll seriously consider value for money."
3,Hinesite is Better Than Forsight,"Mistakes in judgment and in communication between specific people cause lots of heartache and physical pain to result. Two people want to get married because they love each other with all their hearts. Family gets in the way and trys to stop the marriage all a a result of many misunderstandings. If the characters had only been honest with each other,pain and suffering could have been avoided.As with the story in this book,I also made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes but,hopefully, we learn from them. I wish I had read the critics on this book before I wasted my time reading it. I kept thinking the book would get better until half way through the book. I then realized it wasn't going to change but I had too much invested in the book not to finish it."
2,Very disappointing!!,"The story of Lincoln and Melissa in The Pursuit could have been served more properly in a novella. After all, they meet and fall in love within the first 60 pages of the book. Most of this asinine (pardon my use of the word) book is dedicated to the idiotic antics of Melissa's uncles keeping her away from the ""crazy"" boy they haven't seen since he was 10!!! Who in the world could believe this plot? I was very disappointed. I was hoping for more more romantic tension between the characters and less slapstick from the MacFearsons.I am a huge fan of Ms. Lindsey, and I know that she can write romance that sizzles. This doesn't even fizz. I was glad to visit characters from her former stories, but otherwise I don't think she did any justice to Lincoln and Melissa.Please, Ms. Lindsey, give your fans more of what they like from you. I so much miss the chemistry and passion that you have written with your other characters."
2,Breaks Tradition,"When I picked up this novel, I was so excited to that Johanna had written a sequel to one of my favorite books, Love Me Forever starring the unforgettable Lachlan McGregor. That's where the excitement ended. Melissa McGregor, Lachlan's daughter had the potential to have her own memorable love story, yet Ms. Lindsey failed to due her justice. The love-struck swain is forgettable and the actual love story takes up very little of the novel. There isn't that much interaction between the two main characters. Most of the novel revolves around Lincoln's distrust and angst regarding his relationship with his mother. Bitterly disappointed in this effort for which I had such high hopes. Home for the Holidays, Johanna's last historical release, was much better than this feeble effort. If you must read this book, I suggest waiting for the paperback."
1,The Worst Lindsey I've Read,"I normally enjoy any book written by Johanna Lindsey, but this one was extremely disappointing. Lousy plot and a very slow and boring read. If you are normally a Lindsey fan I think this book will disappoint you."
2,The Pursuit of disappointment.,"Johanna Lindsey has always been a favorite author of mine, so I was very disappointed when her latest novel just didn't measure up. The whole story line was rather weak and so were the main characters. I really had to force myself to finish it, and that is not typical of a Lindsey novel. My recommendation is:Don't waste your money on this one, and hope for better novels from Mrs. Lindsey in the future."
2,Not one her best,I actually went out and bought this book because it was her......the charachters lacked depth and some incidents in the book were too unrealistic (like putting the hero on a boat to China without thinking about the consequences).But then i'm still a fan hope she'll do better by us next time!!!
1,I kept thinking the badness had to stop,"But I was wrong. The Puruit sucked the whole way through. I want the hour and a half I spent reading it back.There could have been a decent story in here about a girl who has already made up her mind going through a season anyway, to please her family and learn about society. Instead we get a wooden hero and a cast of unremarkable secondary characters... oh, and no romance to speak of. Lindsey drops potentially interesting plot points like last year's Old Navy fashions, and then throws in every bad plot twist she knows in the last 100 pages.Almost nothing happens in The Pursuit. The entire plot is overtaken by the kudzu-like MacFearson brothers. They're like a circus act.The Pursuit is a sad excuse for a romance novel. I'd give it negative stars if I could."
1,Most boring,"Unbelieveably boring, I kept waiting for this book to pick-up but it did not, which left me very disappointed. I still don't believe Ms. Lindsey wrote this."
2,Nice story,This one was not what I expected from Lindsey. Generally the stories are just better. Both stories which preceded this one was just better. I was disappointed with this one.
1,Real bad,"This is a terrible book for JL. Charaters are dull,there is no real thrill anywhere in the story. There was no need to have written this book at all. I push myself to finish it-jumped several pages and then left it at the train station. Very dissapointed!"
1,What the....?,How is this book written by Johanna Lindsey? So terribly awful!!!!!!!! I'm surprised it was even published! Stay away! Would give it negative stars if i could... could not even care to finish it!
3,A step in the right direction,"I fell in love with Mallory's and then discovered the rest of Ms. Lindsey's work to be just as enchanting and downright FUN. I must agree with the other reviewers however that lately her work hasn't been that great. Still, this book revisits some of my favourite charaters and has a lot of the same humour that is in her earlier books. I enjoyed the plight of Melissa and Lincoln as the fought the uncles on their way to marriage."
2,Tedious and Implausible,"It's always a bad sign when I start flipping pages foward in a book, looking for something to happen, and it didn't take very long into this book before tedium set in and I was looking ahead. Unfortunately, there wasn't much to find. It annoys me very much when period authors use 20th century concepts like drug reactions and psychobabble to motivate their characters. It simply doesn't ring true, and as a reader, I feel insulted that a writer expects me to suspend disbelief to so great a degree.Save your money on this one."
2,Ehh it was okay,"I was thrilled at the thought of reading more about The Macgregor's after Love Me forever I was expecting something with a little more of a kick than wht the Pursuit had Melissa had spirit there was no doubt about it but the author din't do a go job in explain why she was they way she was usually her books are about a couple fighting the love that they have for one another but in this one melissa's loved ones were causing the problems. Lincoln the hero seemed more like a boy that thought that the whole world had wronged him in the end he excepts he was acting childish toward the McFearsons and he lets things be. This was an Okay book if you have nothing else to read, I just hope that Johanna Lindsey gets outs of her writting sulmp and gives us something that can we can copare wth her other hits."
1,"I agree, does not deserve even one star!...","I usually do not write reviews, but this book I have to say was a real disappointment. As mentioned in the other reviews the whole ""problem"" of the story was that a 10 year old boy went sort of crazy after the death of his father and tried his hand at beating up 16 brothers that lived nearby. Nineteen years later he sets his mind to marry the niece of those 16 brothers and they will not allow the marriage due to what happened all of those years ago. She also needs to do research before she writes on a medical problem for that time period as shown in the final chapters of the book, it just was not conceivable! This definately was not Johanna Lindsey at her best!..."
1,Too boring to finish!,"I have been a long time fan of JL, I have tried to stay loyal, but I don't think I can take it any longer. Her last few books have lacked the excitment that I look forward to, and this one made the decision for me. It is time to move on."
1,Is It Lindsey's fault or the Publishers?,"The book was awful and boring! I think publishers want the authors of today to spit out one or two hardcovers a year, assuming, (erronously) that loyal fans will simply read any garbage put before us. Anyone who bought this JL book did get suckered, I guess, but we romance readers learn quickly from out mistakes. JL should be held somewhat accountable, I suppose, after all, it's her imagination, or lack of, that gave us this story. Lincoln was definitely whiny, and babyish. I have never seen a more unmanly hero in my 25 years of reading."
1,She really laid an egg on this one. Pee...Ewe!,"What a complete waste of time. Lindsey was really reaching here for plot. The first two books of this series were actually quite good. I would give Man of My Dreams a 5 Star and the other Sherring Cross after that a 4 star, but this? Ick, terrible. Deep down I wanted to see a love story between Melissa and Justin (the son of Megan and Ambrose). The plot was silly, a regurgitation of crazy uncles protecing a lovable niece, if you know LIndsey's Malory series you know what I mean. Really very stupid...I want my three hours and $3.50 back (glad I got this one from Half Price Books at least). Barf."
2,Lacks previous Lindsey quality,"Although this newset release by Johanna Lindsey has potential, it just does not live up to the quality of the past. As a sequel to LOVE ME FOREVER, you would hope it would be filled with the same humor and stirring passion. Instead, it is full of annoying uncles with confusing names and endless nonsense about how Lincoln was a ""crazy"" child. Didn't we all do crazy things when we were kids? Does that make us crazy as adults? Hardly. The premise is utter nonsense making it quite a disappointing novel. Ms. Lindsey's past few books lack in quality making me wonder if this author is burned out in romance writing. Perhaps if she followed Julie Garwood's example and changed genre, she may find a breath of fresh air to write a book worthy of her talent.Reviewed by Miriam van Veen"
3,The Pursuit,I would have perfered it be writen all in the English. It has words that hard to figure out. I guess some of it is the way the scottich talk. ( Good Story) writing not what I like.
3,"Short, Simple and Sweet","I've read a lot of Johanna Lindsey's works, this is by no means her most stellar piece of prose, but the story makes for a very pleasant read. The book was missing the primary key: tension, especially the kind between the two protagonists.I would recommend this book for a nice afternoon when you have a few hours to spare between loads of laundry, in other words read it whenever you can because the story doesn't require vast amounts of attention."
3,The Pursuit,"This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but it is overly simplistic to be a Johanna Lindsey. Melissa and Lincoln meet and it's practically love at first sight. Throughout the course fo the story they don't spend much time together. The focus of the story seems to be Melissa's 16 uncles. I found it too many to keep track of (especially since many of them were named Ian) and I didn't even try. Their objection to Lincoln's pursuit of Melissa is a fight that occurred 19 years ago. This fight is brought up numerous times--enough times to bring new meaning to the phrase ""making mountains out of molehills."" What's more incredible is that Johanna Lindsey thought that she could base an entire novel around such a flimsy idea. My last objectioin was to Melissa's nickname--""Meli."" What was that about? ""Mel"" maybe, but ""Meli""?"
1,This is the silliest book that I've ever read,"I have read all of Lindsey's books but her most recent plots have become less and less believeable. I kept asking the question why Lincoln wanted to marry into a family of idiots? Secondly, how could anyone judge a person on an act committed at the age of 10? Also, when her father heard the reason for her uncles' objection to the marriage, why wasn't he objective enough to dismiss the a 20 year old incident that occurred between children? Finally Lincoln's mother's rationale for ignoring her son for all those years was absurd.I give up. This is my last Lindsey unless someone gives one to me."
1,Just Can't Seem to Pick This Back Up,"I have read every Joanna Lindsey book and have loved almost all of them. I have tried numerous times to finish this book and I just can't get interested in it. It goes nowhere and there is no romance, no chemistry, no classic Lindsey. I have bought the last few Lindsey novels in hard cover form and I have to say the last three were a disappointment and not worth the cost of hard cover. I will wait for the next book to come out in paperback. Don't waste a penny on this one-wait for the used book sales.I tried, truly to force myself to finish this one, but there are so many other good books and so little time, that I think I will read the last chapter and move on."
1,The Pursuit,"She failed us again! Frankly, I just can't believe Johanna Lindey is actually writing this ""poop"". I noticed her writings started going down hill with ""Love Me Forever"", the spark, the passion, and clash of wills was missing. Definately not up to her usual masterpiece quality.... She had a way of making her characters come to life(hell, most of the time I felt like I was the main character when reading her books). MAYBE JOHANNA LINDSEY ISN'T DOING THE WRITING ANY MORE?????I vote for the old Johanna Lindsey to come back."
2,Wait for the paperback - not one to be re-read,"As a huge JL fan of many, many years, I find this one much below her usual in plot and in the interaction between the main characters.Though, for me, JL's most recent books haven't been as well loved as her earlier works, I at least felt they were worth purchasing and re-reading occasionally. I am relieved I got this one at the library. This was just an ""okay"" to read ""once only"" book for me.:-("
1,Boring!!!!,This book is awful . The book before this one was great. The uncles in this book were rediculous. I can't believe their opinions should matter so much! Boring repetitive and dull. That and the fact the main characters fall in love at first sight after one brief conversation. Really??? Not worth buying.
3,Overprotective trouble...,Seems like true love hit this couple really fast and all the conflict between the pair was the family. They really didn't like Lincoln and Lincoln really didn't like the men who picked on him and bullied him as a child. Somehow the couple manages to stay together despite the odds against them.It was a decent romance with lots of drama and Scotland history. Not my favorite from Johanna Lindsey but very good.
5,Lightening Fast!!,"Faster than a speeding bullet.....!! After purchasing this USB reader, and seeing how fast my digital pictures download, I realize how many hours of my life were lost staring into space with the old cardreader. I use 2gig cards and take lots of photos, and this handles the downloads to my computer with ease. If there are better and faster card readers out there, it doesn't matter to me, this is FAST! It installed quickly and easily on my Dell PC, windows XP, and works perfectly. It is also small and easy to take with me along with my laptop."
1,Not what it advertised,"I bought this because it stated it would accommodate ""SD"" memory cards. It turned out that it did not."
1,This product is a time bomb,"I was initially happy with this reader - it worked well for a year plus change. Until recently.Worrisome: it started making a high-pitched sound when plugged in.Bad: it stopped reading some (but not all) of my CF cards.Worse: sometimes it would read files from the CF card, but the files would be corrupted when they got to my computer.Totally unacceptable: sometimes, it would corrupt files on the CF card, just by trying to read them! This means that I now have images that were destroyed by this reader, just from trying to download them off of the card.I'd recommend staying far, far away from this product."
5,great seller,"Item received quite fast , east coast to west coast. Updated tracking info. Great little zippo. Plan on buying all my Zippo' s from this seller. Currently building up my collection. Added 2 more since this one. Came in original box with warranty wrapped in bubble wrap."
4,very nice,"very nice material and quality thank you ,but the brass is not good enogh for methe size is small and this is very well"
2,Informative but Irrelevant. Obsolete!,"This was great for learning quartz in TIGER but a lot of the examples don't compile in Leopard. A lot of stuff is also (bizarrely) written in C++ in Carbon. Almost the first sentence of every other Mac programming book I've ever read was ""Use Cocoa and Objective C"". Almost every paragraph in the book tells Cocoa programmers where to look for documentation instead. Even the examples that are written in Cocoa are in ""Objective-C++"" (.mm).Granted it was a decent introduction to Quartz and drawing, but if you want to take anything out of the book you have to follow the author's links to where to learn about Cocoa, open up your developer library, and translate everything into actual Objective-C yourself.So unless you plan on developing for Tiger for the rest of your life, stick to Apple's online documentation for learning how to write Mac OS X applications."
1,Quartz2D Graphics for Mac OS developers,OK until you get to chapter 11 on text.Then it is completely obsolete and useless. Its CD of text display programs will not compile on X-Code 3 or X-Code 4.
1,Too basic for a programmer,"If you're buying a book about Quartz, you've probably already read a book about Objective C and Cocoa and you probably already know what a pdf is. Half way through this book, you learn how to draw a circle. I read the whole book, learned nothing new, and am still a feeble programmer in Quartz."
5,The Real World of Terrorists and the Feds.,"Make no mistake about the seriousness of THE ORCHID MEMORANDUM, Wall Street is a prized target of terroists. It has been in the news. Make no mistake about how law enforcement cooperate, it is oil and vinegar. Understand that terrorists know this, and are able to collaborate among themselves and with global organized crime factions. Package these concepts and the reader is exposed to how law enforcement and terrorists operate in the real world. This book is so real it should be required reading by law enforcement and intelligence professionsls, and students. This work contains no filler or puff, just real world action as seen through the authors' eyes."
4,"Good acting, and a good twist for the finale","I am a prude and don't like it at all when characters hop onto each other so quickly. Hey, what happened to romance? The joy of waiting for each other? Etc. etc. Well, so there is a lot going on in this movie which made me press the Fast Forward button. But since most of you are not 'wee old ladies like yours truly, am going to recommend this film, plus suggest that you make sure and get the ""Unrated"" version because it's worth it!"
3,Ok,"Not exceeding unrated edition for a movie was no where in the right category for this product, false advertising on this one."
4,Killing me softly,"I saw this movie again when i bought it, the movie is not just a love story, it is a story how we as women like excitement in our lives. I enjoyed the actors and the story line and the twist of the sister's character. Sometimes there is more to a person then what you see. This movie has it, you can't stop looking at it because you might miss something. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes drama,hot loves scenes and suspense."
4,Very good,"No ""chef d'oeuvre"", like ""Ferwell my Concubine"", but a very very good film signed Kainge. Buy it, look it, you don't regret !"
2,It's hard to dislike a movie starring Heather Graham,"Heather Graham (Swingers, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me) plays a woman who falls for a mystery man played by Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare In Love, Luther). They meet at a crosswalk and things happen from there. Graham follows Fiennes home and the 2 bump and grind. Graham leaves her boyfriend for Fiennes and ends up marrying the man. Graham recieves faxes telling her that Fiennes is not who she thinks he is and she starts to have suspisions. Fiennes is also a big hero to many and he also has a book about him because years ago he saved some people on a mountain climbing expedition but three didnt survive. Good mystery/eroticism goes silly towards the end and loses its cool. Graham is cute and turns in a revealing performance. Fiennes is ferocious and Natascha McElhone is always fun to watch. You know the cat in this movie in my mind should of had more screen time damnit!! Is it just me who thinks that?"
1,Lucky old you,"All I want to say is that the Amazon movie watcher who couldn't get this disc to play in their machine was very VERY lucky !Absolutely dire movie, so bad in all respects that it was almost good. AVOID."
2,partly entertaining,"Both actors didn't catch much of my attention. The story was the usual ""man tricks woman in"" story. I thought that you could guess most of the movie, so there wasn't much surprise. I haven't read Nicci French's book to tell how close this movie was to the expectation that the book might have given. The movie was ok but not particularly great."
1,Killing Me with the Soundtrack,"The only rationale for watching this film is to get off on the players' charms. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But what makes a bad thing worse (and it can't get much worse than this script) - much worse - is the constant repetition of lugubrious strains from the dreadful soundtrack at every turn in the story. So painful was the effect of listening to this riff, that I finally turned off the sound entirely [...]. The action was easier to follow from that point on (which covers how I felt about the screenplay as well). I feel sorry for Ms. Graham, who was raised under the iron fists of backward Mid-western reactionaries, much like Hilary Clinton a generation earlier, and who really makes a sacrifice everytime she disrobes in a flick. But, I guess there'll be some consolation for her when her folks come around begging when they can't afford health insurance."
3,Heather is wonderful!,"I love Heather Graham acting, and in this film, though not excellent, she has a very good performance. The plot is interesting, the erotic scenes are wonderful. Heather is getting better in every film, and this is not the exception.The film establishes a sexual obsession between the couple; however, she's naive, innocent, looking for new sexual experiencies; he's got a past, unkonwn, with many secrets. Among them is his sister, who seems to be a lesbian, but the outcome is different. Most characters are weird, and this inserts a kind of suspense in the film."
1,Boring Me Softly,"Appropriate title for a real sleeper. This attempt at presenting an erotic thriller has more climax in its sex scenes than real suspense. The film amounts to being nothing more than a disengaged soft-porn film. The story is so utterly superficial and psuedo-intellectual that you will fall asleep even with these filler erotic scenes.The movie seeks to capture the theme of an unaroused woman who seeks a more exciting man in her life and encounters a writer-mountain climber to fill her passions. She soon feels that she got more than than she bargained for which is certainly not how you will feel watching this movie.The story is capricious and pretentious, the script is tedious, while the acting is as devoid of all emotion as a Kevin Costner monologue. The actor playing the adventurous mountain climber seems to be too bored with life to even bother remembering his role or utter a single passionate line.Don't waste your time or money on this one, it will kill you softly without a doubt."
2,Heartless b*tch,"Two stars for Heather's almost-complete nudity, but that's about it. The way her character so callously jumped ship on her loving boyfriend to run to the arms of a mysterious stranger after just seeing him on the street is unforgivable.That sort of storyline is not going to win any guys over, since she makes herself out to be very coldhearted from the get go, and it's a bad influence on women who might think this film glorifies and provides encouragement for that sort of wretched behavior.She had a good life going for her, and fell prey to that typical female urge to ignore her comfortable existence and ""see what else is out there"", not realizing, as happens so often to many women, that she'll regret it for the rest of her life.Note to women who may be considering such actions: it's not worth it. Open your eyes to how good you've really got it, and imagine how miserable you'll be when your plans fall through. You'll be left with nothing and no one."
2,waste of time,This movie is a reason why I don't go to movie theater anymore. Hollywood should pay me for reviewing this bad movie. Call me my number is 156-38-3461.
1,There are 2300 dots on my ceiling.,"I believe the word 'guff' was invented specifically to sum up this film. I felt like I was watching an episode of Hollyoaks Late, but with a lower production value.It possesses the entertainment value of a sloth on sedatives, and is about as beleivable as Saddam Husseins good citizen award."
1,"Killing Me Softly, DVD","This movie ranks at the top of one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot sounded interesting, but the lead actress was blank. She lacked character...it was embarrassing to watch her. Her lines were stupid...actually comical! The lead actor was quite believable; unfortuately,that was not enough to carry this movie!Do not waste your money by purchasing this movie!"
3,A review for hetero female viewers,"This review is for other heterosexual females who find Joseph Fiennes wonderfully sexy. The story is silly, Heather Graham's acting and doe-eyed facial expressions are hysterical, unintentionally, and that orange sweater they made Joseph wear was tragic, but I will watch it twice just to see his scenes again. He's intense, passionate, sexy and showing a lot of skin. And in spite of a lame script and co-star, the man can act. I dont know what possessed him to sign on to this movie, but he gives it his best. Love his intensity. Go for the unrated version as I understand it has more nudity."
2,quickly plays itself out,"at first this film seems kinda cool&then it runs into cliche Ville&never lets up. can't tell if it wants to be ""9&Half Weeks"" or Fatal Attraction"". the film gets picked up easily midway through&loses it's coolness really fast. it should have been better."
2,"Could be worth watching, with the right viewer's attitude.","It is not like any of Chen Kaige's other work. Heather Graham is a bad actress. The attraction between the leads is unconvincing. Some of the lines the characters take so seriously that it's funny. So, yes, if you approach this with the right attitude (i.e., it's not an erotic thriller--it's a comedy), you'll thoroughly enjoy it. It borders on camp in the Showgirls and Flash Gordon tradition. Otherwise, stay away--far, far away.There is a lot of sex, but it's not really that explicit, and it's definitely not exciting. Heather Graham's moans are exaggerated and phony. The humping is unconvincing. (...)"
1,killing me softly,the movie mite have been good but the product video cassette was junk it will not play in any player.killing me softly (R-Rated Edition) VHS
3,it's all about the eye candy!,"The things I really enjoyed about this film are the overall production design and look of the film in general. A perfect combo for the popcorn movie enthusiast: beautiful locations (vibrant London and the English countryside), beautiful clothing (Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes are always in ultra chic duds!), and beautiful people in the buff. Chen Kaige has a wonderful visual style (see Yellow Earth, Farewell My Concubine, and his latest, Together among others). He understands the use of colors and landscapes. This film is definitely millions of miles away from his Chinese language films in content but his visual style is still present.A good film to watch for kicks!"
2,Heather Graham almost makes this worthwhile -- but doesn't,"Heather Graham was, as always, incredibly sexy in this film.But alas, I agree with other reviewers who noted the plot here is rather thin. And the demands on the actors' talents are not very high.And for me, the denouement left me unclear about just who had done just what, as explanation of the mysteries that develop in the course of the story. This in particular left me unsatisfied. (And the only possible explanations are not especially satisfying, even if I knew which is the right one, since they lack any trace of complexity.)It's a nice song, though."
4,4 Stars for a Heather Graham fan.,"Yes, just if you really like Heather Graham it is worth 4 stars. This is part of that weird generation of movies with famous Hollywood actresses (Nicole Kidman, Meg Ryan, Halle Berry, etc being NAKED on screen, and by naked I also mean strong sexual situations, not only a shower peek. On the other hand this movie lacked a good Director and it looks like a TV movie or at best a Cinemax production."
4,"Fairly advanced lessons, not for beginners","I am learning mandolin after playing violin for many years; I can pick out a tune pretty easily but am not familiar with chords or mandolin technique. These CDs and the book contain a wealth of knowledge, but they are pretty advanced. There are discussions of double stops, slides, and different hand positions (first, second) within the first 10 minutes or so. Also, the previous reviewer is correct that you need to take copious notes. There are a lot of quick references to things like ""third finger on the 8th fret, second finger on the third fret of the fourth string,"" etc., which are hard to process quickly. It would be wonderful if Dave Grisman could put together some simpler lessons! I am giving this four stars because of the wealth of knowledge contained in the CDs, but I would give it three stars for someone at my skill level, and less for rank beginners."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"shoes last about two months before they start to leak, the cheap sole wears away and the cheap leather on top starts to peal away from exposure"
2,Got to love it!,"My favorite song is ""on some real sh"" the beat is hot and Daz rode the beat so f'ing nicely. The rest of the songs are just OK. I wouldn't recommend a purchase of this album, but you should definately buy some singles."
1,"Daz Needed Some $, Album under So So Def","I love Daz, but this album sucks. Homeboy needed some quick cash and he linked up with So So Def's, Jermaine Dupri, and the album is a joke. Other Daz albums are much much better. Don't even waste your time listening to this one. It's depressing."
1,below rate scale,"the edges were sharp. the metal was lightweight . the overall look was disappointingly ""Dollar General"" My fault for thinking I was getting something good for cheap price. i know Gibson has made this style of flatware in a better quality than this. i was hoping this was the same stuff and low priced if discontinued style. not worth price to ship back"
2,limited use,"I found the information on behaviour and animal welfare to be limited and, in places, questionable. For example the use of single animal hanging cages is treated as standard husbandry -- despite the strong recommendation in most national laws and guidleines that social contact and environmental enrichment be provided to rats in the laboratory."
2,UNDER PENNSYLVANIA SKYS,"The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack, a grey-necked Pennsylvainia steel town's hopes and fears are a musical noir that only wants to see the town's high school trophy football go through the field goal. Nice cinema during the football scenes. A bit dull though. If only Tom hadn't spent so much time thinking about football, he might have gotten into a better college. Life is like that."
2,Lucky for the coach this wasn't Boston or Philadelphia,"ALL THE RIGHT MOVES will hold your interest for a while. But the movie paints itself into a corner - it winds up hinging on whether or not the high school football coach will forgive his star player for vandalizing his home. Hardly riveting drama. The blue-collar town mood of ALL THE RIGHT MOVES seems realistic. Actress Lea Thompson plays the most All-American young woman I have ever seen on the silver screen. And the film does not exaggerate the kooky love-hate relationship sports fans have with their teams, if you recall what happened to pro athletes Bill Buckner and Mitch Williams after they blew big games. See ALL THE RIGHT MOVES on television, where it's good value."
1,I thought it enjoyable fluff in the day,But now somehow just the sight of Cruise's face makes me jump to change the channel. The magic of acting is shot when you know the actor is someone like him (ain't he never had the magic to start with).
4,A somewhat forgotten cult classic!!,"This is one of Tom Cruise's early movies and while a bit cheesy, it was an entertaining enough production. Lea Thompson made her film debut, while Craig T. Nelson was outstanding in his potrayal of the head football coach. For those who grew up in the 80s, this is a definite cult classic and well worth the viewing."
3,entertaining but conflict is resolved too easily,"This is a fairly formulaic film with a synthesizer-based soundtrack, quite common in the 1980s. It's entertaining enough, with a small-town guy trying to find a way out of the stifling environment and the seemingly lackluster future if he stays. Of course he has a love interest, a coach he clashes with, and dreams of college.The problem is this: the ending is quite anticlimactic, with the coach relenting and finally granting a scholarship to the fellow, apparently because the fellow's girlfriend guilted the coach into doing so. This all happens in the last few minutes, so it's really more of a deus ex machina than a true resolution."
4,Tom's star rises,"All The Right Moves was the film that discovered Tom Cruise.Tom plays a high school football superstar looking to get out of his steel mill town via a college scholarship.Craig T Nelson plays his coach. (This was before he was TV's Coach!) He also thinks a winning team could get him a job at a college.Lea Thompson hadn't gone Back to the Future yet, but plays Tom's girl.The movie is light weight but still fun to watch.A must have for all Tom Cruise fans.DVD EXTRAS: None"
3,All the Right Moves,This movie was also a little slow. What was interesting is the fact that a coach would try and blackball a player from going to college.
4,Another Great Tom Cruise Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,This movie will touch your heart. Tom and Leah are fabulous together. If your not in high school it will take you back to it. It also has a great ending that will definately leave you satisfied!!!!!!!!!!!! If you haven't seen this one rent it and once you do you'll be searching to buy it. HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Amazing value, some wonderful songs","For the money this is an amazing find. Although there are some tracks with poor sound, considering that these were salvaged from very old vinyl, the sound here is mostly excellent. Lovers of vintage country music will be thrilled with this collection, and with the other Membran label Country and Western box set. THIS REVIEW REFERS TO a 10 CD box set ON THE MEMBRAN LABEL only."
4,Great Actors And Excellent Plot But Unfortunately Not Funny,"Recently I have watched all her very funny television series on DVD yet went it comes to make you laugh this Eve Arden movie does not measure up but it can pass perhaps for first-class entertainment yet neither comical nor funny.She is as usual impressive, gracious, a woman with substance and Robert Rockwell, Gale Gordon, Richard Creena, Don Porter (Yet Porter was not part of the TV shows) and Jane Morgan deliver, as they did in the television series, an incomparable accurate performance but this movie runs more like a sober love story than the super hilarious film as advertised by Warner Brothers.Oh, one more thing; at last at the end Miss Brooks is able to finally catch Mr. Boynton, and that was a fine thing to happen to both of them, for heaven sake."
1,Not enough info to give an accurate rating,"This rating reflects the lack of information needed to evaluate this product. I love Eve Arden and would love to buy this. But it is listed as one disk for 85 minutes. No indication of how many episodes but at 85 minutes, it could not be more than 3. This is pretty steep for the listed new price at 39.99, in fact it is more than steep, it is unacceptable.My guess is that the information listed is incorrect and should be adjusted to reflect the fact that it is probably a multi-dvd set. Without that adjustment (or a steep drop in price to under $10), it is hard to see how anyone would buy this."
2,ruined by moronic narration,Fantastic video but the pretentious narration is just terrible. If only one could switch it off altogether. In the end I switched to the Spanish which I found less intrusive and used the English subtitles the first time. The next time I just watched the video without subtitles as the text is just too pompous and pretentious for words. What a shame reallySuggest rent as the ghastly narration works against watching it too often
2,"All Beauty, No Substance","This film deserves credit for the wonderful shots it capture. Beauty aside, it's frustratingly uninformative. Additionally, plot lacks coherence, as do most segments--it's just a series of pretty shots the director did not know what to do with.This film was so bad, in fact, it made my meal taste worse."
3,SKIP. IMAX Under the Sea was 10x better,I thought it was going to be briillant colors and images showing the majesty of our planet and the animals in it. WRONG. It is one tramatic story after another and the camera work was lacking.
4,Great images well worth watching,Great images well worth watching even my partner who hates documentaries watched it from start to finish. Do your self a favor and go see it.
4,Awesome,"Espectacular high-definition adventure. Congratz to Disney for this great product. Recommended to averyone, fromd kids to the most experienced ones. Try it."
3,Beautiful! And the narration is only occasionally annoying,Beautiful! And the narration is only occasionally annoying and there is almost no anthropomorphizing of the critters (which kept me away from other Disney Earth Day movies). See this in a big screen if you get the chance just for the stunning images.
3,Go with Planet Earth instead,"It's not a bad film, but after seeing Planet Earth, I had higher expectations, and thought Disney would be up for the challenge. I bought it for my son and thought the voice of ""Thomas the Train"" (Pierce Brosnan) would hold his interest, but I think it put him to sleep instead. I also didn't love the script. A bit silly, just going on about how we have to be *in* the ocean to *understand* the ocean. Got a bit old.Seriously, Planet Earth is that much more amazing, and for a few dollars more, you get more discs and a 100 times the visuals and experience."
2,Watch the French Version,"I saw the Disney version in the theaters back in March and the narrative is really disappointing and the film is dumbed down. I recently watched the French version which is much more poetic and shows more of the challenges the ocean is facing. Not to mention, the film is longer so you get more amazing footage. This is probably the best ocean documentary ever made."
3,It's just okay,We liked the movie okay. I bought it without having seen it before and I probably wouldn't buy it again. We like Planet Earth and Life much better. My son LOVES anything related to the ocean but this movie didn't seem to interest him as much.
2,Beautiful pictures spoiled by silly script,"Oceans is filled with some amazing pictures, from a lone scuba diver swimming alongside a shark that's 10 times his size to a series of close-ups of sea creatures that look more like something from a cheap Hollywood horror movie than something actually found in nature. Sadly, most of what's shown in the movie won't be new to the audience, particularly if you've seen any of the plethora of nature movies and television specials that have been released over the past few years (a cuttlefish is a cuttlefish is a cuttlefish), but it's still beautifully photographed and looks great on the big screen.While it's lovely to look at, however, Oceans is more than a little tedious to sit through.[...]"
2,wasn't what I expected,I suppose it was my fault because I didn't ordered the MOVIE. this was I received was how they made the movie..just a few pictures. I was very disappointed.
3,"Stunning imagery, weak narration.","I purchased this Blu-ray as a Christmas gift for my wife because she loves the Planet Earth series so much. Visually, this is some of the best aquatic wildlife footage we have ever seen, but the writing is weak with little to no story line, and long, misplaced chunks of silence. Too bad."
5,Great for everyone!,"""This is one of the best dvd's for the family I have ever purchased. It captures the greatest part of the ocean, from jellyfish to mass feedings and natures circle of life. I think it's appropriate for all age groups, from three years old to adult, we all found it captivating. With Pierce Brosnan narrarating, it was very easy to understand and very peaceful to listen to. It isn't just a story, it depicts real life. I've given it several times over as a gift . . . to everyone."""
3,Good,"I first saw this film as part of the French film festival in Sydney, Australia in 2011 and loved it for its dramatic impact and moving images. The French sound track is by far the easiest on the ear and you need a great surround sound system and large screen to really get the most out of the film. Some scenes seem almost too good, giving me the sense of aquarium shots now and again, but that is not to say that it actually was the case and if not then all credit to a first class production team.Overall, I loved this film sans Pierce Brosnan. If I could just turn off the commentary/narrative altogether and have only the sounds of the oceans and the creatures that inhabit them as the sound track, this film would be perfect."
4,All in all a good product,"This is the second time we purchased this product and were overall happy with the product. It's easy to use, a great size, good heat output and safety features. There is only one thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars. For several weeks, when you first start using it, it produces a pretty noticeable odor but it does go away."
2,Smelly!,Cons:1. This heat gives off a very annoying smell. I've run the heater for a total of about 2 hours and the smell has not gone away.2. The controls are a bit confusingPros:1. Compact size is nice2. It does generate a reasonable amount of heat for its size3. Not too noisy compared to other heaters I've used with a fan.
2,Not What's Advertised,"Unlike what the item's description says, this heater is not variable from 0-1500W.It's actually variable from 400-1500W which means it never automatically shuts off.So if you have it set for 50 and the room temperature is 70 it is still on it's low heat setting.Also, after a weeks usage, it still has hot plastic smell.The compact size and heat output are both excellent but not the controls!"
2,Disappointed,"Since I already owned this same model Pelonis heater for 4 or 5 years, I was pleased to find it again and expected the same quality from the Pelonis brand. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The new heater's thermostat failed right after being turned on for the first time. Unlike my older heater, the new version now features a manual mode as if they do expect the thermostat to fail. With the manual mode, the heater can still be used by setting the speed, but it's definitely not as nice as the original one of this same model. It's also simply too much money to pay for something that does not work as described. Like most things these days, the quality is way less than products we used to be able to purchase with confidence."
1,Costly lesson,"I purchased this item after reading the claimed performance. I have a room in the lower level of my house that is generally colder than the rest of the house. Rather than run the furnace, I usually use a small space heater. Unfortunately, most space heaters don't work that well.And neither does this. For all the promised performance, cheaper existing heaters I own work better. This thing is not quiet, and ran a long time before providing measurable increase in temperature (one of few benefits of this heater is the digital temperature gauge that let me know how well it was not working).I'm sure this product does well at heating small rooms or the underside of a desk, but for the price you can buy two heaters that do just as well.Adding insult to injury, between the restocking fee and shipping, I ended up paying a third of the cost of the unit just to find out it did not work."
2,A little disappointing,"I'm a huge Willie fan but this performance just didn't do it for me. The best description that my husband and I could come up with is that Willie and his band seemed ""tired""."
2,Willie Needs To Try Harder,Willie just doesn't want to hit the high notes any more so sings in a flat style - disappointing. It's been the same now for several of his live efforts - I should've learnt a long time ago.
5,Tired Willie,To the person who wrote that Willie and his band seemed tired. Yes he may seem tired on this D.V.D. but you must remember he's 77 now. I hope I can be as good when I reach his age. I can understand what you are saying as he has slowed down a bit but he is still good. I really dread the day he goes to the big gig in the sky. Then we will have to rely on discs like this to get our Willie fix. I absolutely love this performance as it typifies the man with all his attributes and failings.
2,Uninspired Performance,"I love Willie Nelson, but this was a terribly disappointing live performance. Nelson and his band sleepwalk through their greatest hits, looking bored and uninterested. Nelson doesn't even sing some of the songs, he just speaks the lyrics. It's as if he's sung these songs a thousand times and can't bear to do it again.But the lack of energy is just one of the reasons to be disappointed. Some of the instruments and some of the singing are out of tune. The sound quality of the recording is not that good either.I'd walk ten miles in a snowstorm to see Willie play live. But if you're looking for a Willie Nelson DVD or CD, there are much better choices available."
2,Why isn't Willie singing?,"I can't go down to 1 star because it's Willie, but what's really disappointing is that the setlist is so awesome, however Willie simply refuses to sing and instead ""talks"" the lyrics like others have stated. I would recommend the Willie and Ray Charles dvd instead of this one."
2,Not quite as listed,"This product said it had a belt clip and it didn't, so it arrived and surprise, no belt clip, so I called the company. They apologized for the incorrect info."
3,Not the same,"I had some old Mantovani LP's that I loved. This CD set is nice listening, but it sounds like it was recorded with an orchestra half the size of the originals. They are OK, but not what I had hoped for.Why do another recording? Why not just reissue the LP originals on CD?"
3,Easy listening style of Mantovani,I have an original recording C.D. of Mantovani and i expected this to be the same.Good listening but not like the real thing i will be more careful in the future to make sure it is the Maestro
2,Beware,Not really a Mantovani recording; a Mantovani Orchestra recording. But a pleasant album of innocuous easy listening mood music.
5,Hilarious Fun!,This was so funny. I loved every episode. Penguins Of Madagascar goodness and a great contribution to anyone's holiday collection.
4,Not all Xmas,"I thought this was an all Xmas themed DVD, but it seems only one episode had a Xmas theme. THey were great stories nonetheless."
5,Holiday Fun,A fun Christmas with the penguins interacting with Santa Claus. It is fast paced and enjoyable for kids and adults.
1,Almost no Christmas content,"This DVD contains only one episode related to Christmas, maybe about 10 minutes. The animation quality is only TV level, but that was expected. But marketing it as a Christmas DVD is deceptive. The rest of the content is mediocre."
3,"Compared to Merry Madagascar, its 3 stars","First, I am a fan of all of the Madagascar and the Penguins are great in all of the movies. Also, the kids laugh hard at Merry Madagascar. The Penguins on their own are good but they are 3 stars compared to the entire Madagascar group. If you love the Penguins, then this would probably be 4-5 stars."
2,Just so so,I was disappointed for the most part.took a chance thats all.Not at all what I was hoping for.A few good songs but not much else.
2,Cage is poorly constructed,"I received this cage, and promply put it together. I got it as sort of an additional play room for my rats. I had intended on hooking it to the other cage I had purchased elsewhere, via the tubes it comes with. The plastic bottom was all warped, and the holes in the side of the cage were oddly shaped, so it made getting the tubes in nearly impossible. I was so frusterated, and by the time I got everything put together, I had scrapes all over my knuckles. However, it does have one nice feature, to where the bottom slides out, making it easy to clean, but the bedding seems to fall out because it doesn't fit flush with the rest of the cage. But I'd say that small 'plus' doesn't over-ride the fact that it's pretty much a shoddy cage. My rats seem to love it, so that's a good thing, but I know I won't be buying another of this brand again."
2,cheaply made,"This was awful to assemble. The tubes are halves that fit together to make a whole portion, there are many pieces of the wire cage so that everytime that I try to adjust something another area comes undone. The wheel was awful. My son has a mouse, he is good sized but the wheel stuck everytime around. I had to replace it. It didn't come with a water bottle. The tubes do look fun, maybe for a hamster or a bigger rodent but the 2 mice we have had in it don't like the upper portions of the tubing. I am looking online now for a better option. The tray that pulls out for cleaning is a nice feature. I have been putting pieces of paper to line the bottom of the cage because the wire isn't supposed to be good for the little feet. The shredded stuff falls right through and is awful to try to remove."
3,difficult,the product is smaller than what it would seem and it is very difficult to put together. the rubber seals fit very snuggly which almost causes you to break the plastic pieces.
5,Five stars PLUS 1!!!!!!,"I am a die hard Fringe Fan (Fringer), there is no doubt about that, but even if you don't watch the Fox TV series (and you should) you will enjoy this music. This is some of the best TV soundtrack score music out there. Michael Giacchino and Chris Tilton are masters of suspenseful thrilling sounds that take you the edge of the parallel universes of Fringeland musically, and dangle you there while daring you to look into the Fringe vortex. This duo have surpassed my long time favorites, Sean Callery and Jeff Beal. What else can I say except that I LOVE THIS SHOW!I LOVE THIS MUSIC!!Great Amazon price too!Get it and don't look back. You can Download it to your Kindle and read a thrilling book while listening to it, then you'll know what I'm talking about."
5,Terrific compilation,"If you love Fringe the way I do, you'll enjoy this compilation of music from the series. Haunting and complex, the music recreates the mystery and wonder of the show."
1,Crystals breaking,"Bought first one, a few days later I heard a pop and a circular piece of the crystal had broken out. No impact. Was just standing still. Ordered another thinking that it must be a fluke. Had this watch and again a few days later, heard a pop and saw a circular piece of the crystal had popped out. Daughter was standing next to me and even saw it happen. I would not recommend this type of watch from Skagen."
1,Glass blew up,Got this for my sister 1 month ago and the glass blew up by itself. I didn't quite believe it when I read other reviewer's comment about the glass exploding by itself till it happen to me too! Crappy product. Do no buy!
3,bad luck with Skagen crystals,"My watch crystal lasted four months. I must have tapped it with a power tool I was carrying yesterday. Last night I noticed the crystal had a large circular crack and was fractured in one spot. The watch still runs, however I'm sending it off to Skagen's Nevada repair facility for a $25 crystal replacement. I had to do the same repair on another Skagen watch but that crystal lasted about three years. I guess in this price range the ""super hardened mineral"" crystal that Skagen promotes is actually rather fragile.Otherwise this is a very comfortable thin watch for those of us with small wrists."
1,Crystal Breaks spontaneously! Skagen now made in CHINA!,"I just returned my watch to Macy's. I've had it for one month. I went to put it on today and noticed that the crystal had popped!A large circular piece of it had fractured around the edges and broken off. The watch has never been dropped or bumped, and was worn about a dozen times. The clerk refunded my money but did not believe that I hadn't bumped it. After reading these posts, I see that this is an extremely common occurrence! Don't buy Skagen! If you look closely and read about Skagen online, you will see that these watches are now made in CHINA! That explains the falloff in quality. Seiko makes a durable and long lasting watch.I recommend you buy one of them."
2,Faulty crystal,I had the same problems with faulty crystal as those above...it developed a stress fracture on its own (no impact or other reason). Has anyone been able to make progress with Skagen or figure out how to replace the part?
1,Crystal crack,"I have a Skagen watch myself and the crystal cracked for no apparent reason. The crack is from the top to botton of the watch, but the watch is still running fine. I dont remember any impact on the watch and besides, I have been very careful with this watch as this is amongst my more expensive watches. With all the other reviews, I feel mine is not an isolated case and happened for no fault of mine."
1,Not worth the money...at all.,"This watch broke within 2 hours of wearing at a dinner party. Crystal broke like a piece of ice against the edge of a wine glass. How do you get your money back from a piece of garbage like this? So my wife bought it for me for xmas, now what do I say to her? I really hate getting ripped off...this bites."
5,"Now, I'm Back In This World...I Think!!","I've read this book three times, and plan to reread it again soon. I still can't stop thinking about it. I was really 'not in this world' anymore when I finished this fantastic story.What a read!Being a voracious reader, I know from the first few sentences whether I am hooked or not, and this was obviously one to just go with!!I loved the premise, and the characters were quirky and real.The style of the writing was deceptively simple so everyone can read and love this story, but it is also very sophisticated in the sense that it assumes that the reader and the author are sharing this experience together.One doesn't need to be convinced of the plot. That is not a simple thing to do when reading about ghosts, but Dewey's total involvement makes it very real. I can truly say that I just know that this happened!I highly reccommend ""Aaron's Crossing"" for anyone who hopes that their next read is an incredible one.This one is.You'll love it!"
2,TRUE ghost story? Nah. Don't think so.,"If you are a fan of Ghost Hunters, skip this book. If you like a nice fiction story with a touch of the paranormal, buy this book. It's an interesting story but, IMO, it's just a STORY. I can't suspend my disbelief to believe a ghost dictated the entire story of his life and death and after-death to the author. (And I REALLY had a hard time believing that this ""ghost"" had to learn some of the exact same things that Patrick Swayze had to learn in the movie, ""Ghost"".) Total ghostly phenomena in here accounted for about 2% of the book as a whole. It's a pleasant enough read but it won't go on the shelf with my paranormal books."
2,Not even good fiction,When I bought this book I expected it to be a true story. This wasn't even good fiction. I'm sorry I wasted my money. There was nothing about this book that made me believe it was a true or accurate account of a ghost or spirit.
3,Very slow going,"Everyone has a sad story to tell, and this was longer than most. (Boring) Theory of being stuck and relatives coming for you to help you cross over fairly accurate."
1,Aaron's Crossing,"This book was suggested by a friend of the author for our book club. It was universally disliked. The premise was specious, the writing style infantile and the content laughable. It seems inconceivable that an adult would write such pap. Then we looked at who had published it and knew!"
5,Great book!,"I loved this book. Geez, what fortitude Dewey has to write this account of her real-life experience. As I read, I kept thinking, ""wow, this really happened to her."" It made me so much more interested in the story."
5,Aaron's story gives lots to think about,"I've read Aaron's Crossing twice and have given copies to many friends. It is a sad story, an inspirational story, and a hopeful story. Even for skeptics about the truth of the story, it doesn't matter. The story is fascinating and well told. And if the only lesson you learn is to listen more to what's going on around you, it is valuable."
5,Aaron's Crossing,"AARON'S CROSSING, a suspenseful, well-written book, has changed my concept of Hell. Although I have studied metaphysics for many years, I never knew some earth-bound spirits are here involuntarily. Aaron was tired, but he was unable to ""go to the light"" as I thought spirits could do at will. He was stuck in the earth plane, and miserable. I highly recommend this compelling story. Marie Gates, author of SHADOWS ON MY MIND: A PSYCHOLOGIST EXPLORES REINCARNATION AND PSI"
1,Doesn't Like to Share,"We purchased this item thinking it would be easier to use for home management that Microsoft Outlook. Unfortuately, we cannot download our addresses to or from any commoly used software. I am afraid of mannually inputing this information because it would be a tremendous waste of time if it cannot be shared,"
5,Use with caution for other animals,"Make a rat bait container. Buy large size black PVC pipes about 4"" wide(so you can get your hand in to change the bait). Have the hardware store cut each bait tube about 18"" long.Drill a hole on one side of the tube towards the center and a hole parallel on the other side so that a long thin metal stake ( used for holding down drip system hoses) or BBQ skewer can be inserted straight through the tube. Thread the stake through one side to the other catching the rat poison bait blocks inside the tube like a shish kabob. This way other animals are less likely to reach into the tube and get it and the rats HAVE TO EAT IT THERE and they can't haul it off to another location that may injure family pets. It's also easy to reload more bait in this tube."
1,Never used it,Never used this product because I could not open the station to insert toe bait. It went back to the store.
4,so far so good.,Got rid of the rodents that moved in last winter. Time will tell how it works now that winter is upon us again and we see what critters invade us this year and how well this works to keep them from making themselves at home.
5,Buy it in bulk and give it away!,"I found this book in the Stephen Ministry library at our church. After reading it I preached a series on the topic of criticism, and we purchased a stack of them and gave one to every family in the church. Money well spent!Diehm is specific, balanced, and honest. His writing is accessible and practical. The book is suitable for small group use.I also recommend a book on a related topic, IF STANDING TOGETHER IS SO GREAT, WHY DO WE KEEP FALLING APART? by Tom Kraeuter, which you can get here on Amazon, but probably faster through Training Resources of Hillsboro, Missouri or through YWAM (Youth With a Mission), both of whom have websites. You can even read my review for Kraueter's book (longer than this one) on Amazon.God bless you and the people you love! This book will help!"
1,I'm hoping that this is not one of her better books,I'm assuming that this book is one of Ms. Busbees worst novels because if all of her other books are this bad she should stop writing altogether! It was terrible. Reading it felt like a long drawn out marathon. I often found myself daydreaming while reading it. The idea of the book is ok but it is written so horribly that everything just goes to waste. I don't think that I will be reading another one of her books but I just don't understand why it was so bad because I always thought that Avon romances were the better romances.
4,A good read,"Shirley Bushbee is not one of the most inventive or creative romance writers around, and her recent stuff has really stunk up the place, but this old novel of hers is one of my favorites, and it made my keeper shelf many years ago. The other reviewers go into the plot, so I won't repeat it. Suffice to say it's got a story that moves along, with two likable main characters and a believably certifiable villian, plus some hot love scenes. I seem to re-read this at least once a year, so I recommend it."
5,Review of Tiger Lily,I eagerly waited for this book to first be published. The story finally wraps up the threads of political intrigue in Deceive Not My Heart and Gypsy Lady and is a fitting companion to these popular novels. Brett Dangermond was such an intriguing character and I was glad to see him get his own love story. I also am pleased this book is set in old Spanish Texas since that is where I am from and I often feel this beautiful area is neglected in romance literature. I believe anyone who enjoys Shirlee Busbee's other novels must add this book to their collection and I hope it comes back into print soon.
3,A bit disappointing,"I just bought this to add to the collection I built up as a child before sealing it all away for a rainy day. Thought it would add something. Main problem for me is that the illustrations are so grim. I suppose you shouldn't expect too much from such a low-budget affair, but on the other hand, there is no excuse for grainy little images nowadays. So it's 2 stars. If you're strange enough to want to know all this stuff though, I guess you'll have to buy it, because the choice in this field is not exactly wide!"
5,Great strings!!,"I'm new to electric bass guitar so i haven't compared all the different strings yet. So far these are definitely an improvement over the stock strings. I tried GHS boomers, and they are pretty good also. The DR's are a little brighter in my opinion. Open the box all the way, as in unfold it, for good instructions on string replacement!"
3,Crash: The Mystery of Flight 1501,"The title itself beckened me to order the movie; I'll try most movie w/plane crashes.I liked this movie, but it didn't have suspense all the way, though it did keep my interest; main reason I gave it three stars. Another plus, a good cast.P.A. Gross"
4,opera glasses,"If you'll notice in the picture the chain is black and silver because a little black string is wound around the chain for decorative effect. This was completely tangled when I received it with no hope of getting it back to the way it was intended, I spent an hour or more trying to untangle it. I don't think it's the seller's fault, just a silly decoration that does more harm than good and gets tangled in transit. Otherwise the glasses look nice and function pretty well. I would just snip off the string at each end and leave the chain, it's nice enough looking by itself."
3,"Good looking, not the most functional","These offer serious bling, what being silver with a long glitzy chain. Only problem is that as binoculars, they barely magnify anything. They are clear, but I would say the magnification is barely one level at best."
5,A great book.,"Webb is one of the best military authors out there. This book combines both the soldiers' view of life, as in Fields of Fire, with the seamy side of military life; our senior military and political leadership. If you enjoy any of the Clancy-type military/political thrillers you will enjoy this book and realize Webb actually inserts some thought and insightful commentary while giving a good read."
4,Something To Die For,Well written and fast moving. This writer has a way with words and a firm grasp of the English language. His character development leaves no question about the characters relationships.
2,Give it a miss,"Unless you are a real fan of ""unbelievable"" thrillers I would give this one a miss. Webb's Fields of Fire is, by a wide margin, his best. All the follow-on writings have not lived up to it."
4,Sunny....,"Most people buy this disc for the hit ""Crying"" (which does showcase Mclean's awesome vocal range & stamina), but the best cuts are the waltzy ""It's Just The Sun,"" ""It Doesn't Matter Anymore,"" and 50's rocker Gene Vincent's, ""Lotta Lovin',"" (the original version of which can be found on the 3 CD box set, ""Rock & Roll Legends""). However, having owned this album on vinyl (!), I am thrilled at the bonus track, ""If You Could Read My Mind,"" which is the best cover of Gordon Lightfoot's masterpiece I have heard since the soundtrack to the film, ""54"" where a girl group does the ditty disco-justice!"
4,great quality,"it is really warm and comfy, and nice quality, love it so much even wears it at home , the only problem is i bought small, but it is still too big. but with ACU it doesnt really a problem."
3,Sounds Better Than U87 - at first.,I've recorded several albums using the Neumann U87 for my vocals. For my voice this $300 microphone worked better for a time. Then I started to notice the graininess and sibilance. And it picks up the room noise in my project studio. Switched to the more expensive but quite worth it Avant cv12.
5,My Rotten Red Headed Older Brother Review,I think this book is good. I give it 5 stars because I like when Patricia Polacco wants to beat her brother at something. She then beats him at going around the carousel more times than him. I like this book. I want to read more books by Patricia Polacco. I would recommend this book to all ages of kids.
5,Patricia Polacco review,I like my Rotten Redheaded Older Brother because it is interesting and exciting.It is funny because she and her brother fight a lot and sometimes me and my brother fight a lot. The pictures are nice because there are a lot of colors.
4,Patricia Polacco Review,I enjoyed the book My Rotten Redheaded Older Brother because I like when they are always fighting. It was funny when she was on the carousel.I think my teacher could read this book.
1,No pictures on kindle version WORTHLESS!,I can't believe I wasted my money of this children's books without pictures are worthless when trying to teach a child to read. I want my money back!
1,Lots of fluff...could have been 1/10th the pages.,"First off, the book is poorly described in the table of contents. God help you if you need to find something specific in a reasonable amount of time. This book could have delivered the critical info in a 15 page pamphlet. There are simply some things you need to do and a few others that you need to avoid. You are better off buying ""2001 Guide to Literary Agents"" and ""2002-2003 Writer's Guide to Book Editors, Publishers, and Literary Agents."" If you buy those two books, you'll get as much distilled info about book proposals as you need WHILE AT THE SAME TIME getting the contact information you need."
3,Helpful But Could Be Better,"This book has a lot of good information but I was disappointed in the proposal examples. Everyone reading this book would not necessarily have published three or four books. I doubt that people who have written that many books would need to buy a book on how to write a proposal. It would have been helpful had the author included an example of a new, unpublished writer's proposal."
5,"Practical, well-written, a must for the non-fiction writer.","I used this book to prepare the book proposal for my first book and sold my manuscript. That was a couple of years ago and I plan to apply Larsen's approach for my next proposalThe author provides practical advice and more than a little introduction into the ""business"" of publishing--and that is one of theprinciples the reader of this book will come to understand. Simply being a good writer does not assure one of a publisher; the succesful writermust show a publisher that her book is a good business proposition. Larsen's book can help you do that. In this light, you won't find any tricks or shortcuts. What you will findis solid advice on how to put together a good book proposal, the key ingredient being a lot of hard work. I recommend this to friends who say they want to write."
4,Makes a good tom yum soup.,"I love Asian soups, generally, and tom yum talay is my favorite of the lot. This paste is a very easy way to get that taste at home. I simply add two teaspoons of this paste to 4 cups of water, add fresh mushrooms and white fish, and bring to a boil for a while. The soup is tasty and low-calorie. You should know, however, that the paste does have MSG (monosodium glutamate) in it. If you're not worried about that, I recommend the paste."
5,rockin!,Dude. Get this book. But be careful because you'll get addicted to it and then you'll have to buy Things That Make You Go Hmmm: The '90s Music Party Game too.
5,Great Read and Series!,"If you like the Dark-Hunter Series or any other vampire series, this will be a great read!"
2,"Good series, disappointing first book","I am not going to go into detail, I see this has been done already.This is not a bad series, however I found this book lacked passion, even though it was a very moving story with a very interesting plot. I do recommend this book as a nice vampire romance, but if you are looking for toe-curling passion this is not the book for you."
5,Wonderful start to an amazing series!,"I read the summary of this book and thought it sounded interesting (I sooo underestimated how truly wonderful this book would be!). This is the best vampire novel I've ever read and one of my favorite books of all time! I became enthralled in the story that unfolded before me and read 'Be Mine Tonight' in one sitting! I laughed, I cried, and I mourned when the book was finally over because I had fallen in love with Chapel and Pru.I wanted to know what they found in Italy. Do they find Temple, or did the Order kill him? Did Marcus and Father Molyneux find Bishop? And what about Reign and Saint? I can't wait to read the rest of the series, but no matter how good those books may be, I know without a doubt in my mind that 'Be Mine Tonight' will remain my very favorite of the Brotherhood of Blood series.Anyone who wants to read a truly good romance novel needs to buy this book, you won't regret it!"
3,Nice read but too slow for me...,"I thought I might enjoy this book as I enjoy paranormal books by Kelly Armstrong, Kresley Cole and Gena Showalter, but it was just a bit too slow for me. Nice read though, but I'm undecided as to whether I will continue to read the series."
4,Touching and unique take on a Vampire love story,"This was an emotional story about a young woman Prudence, who is dying of cancer and is desperate to find the Holy Grail, when her search gets closer to actually finding the Grail the church sends Chapel, a 600 year old vampire. Chapel is looking for a very different artifact, the Blood Grail and is determined to prevent others from his fate, drinking from then turning into the monster he see's himself to be. An unexpected relationship develops and tests Chapels convictions about life and death. Have plenty of tissue ready, the love between Pru and Chapel will make you cry.In this first book, Smith introduces us to Chapel one of 6 warriors who has become a vampire, and who dedicates his life to preventing the Blood Grail from falling into the wrong hands. This was an enjoyable read and I am looking forward to reading her next book, ""Night of the Huntress"" which tells the story of Bishop another one of the warrior vampires."
1,Bad Service,I got a different product from what I had purchased. Instead of the chronicle history of King Henry... I got a twin DVD set of Hamlet and Henry V.What a waste
1,Bad Business to deal with,"Un-reliable company, they don't safeguard your original media.Buyer Beware.This company has over-extended itself and does not provide the quality you would expect from a business providing this type of service."
1,Online Video Viewing Rip off,Had $120 worth of videos transferred and put online to view and edit. If you don't finish you have to pay MORE to keep online or buy DVDs for another $50 for 2 hours which cannot be shared online at all. Horrible waste of time and money. And it is very hard to find info online for pricing to keep online...decieving! So my videos are gone now and I am back to square one...I will go to a computer shop and get done now local and reliable! Customer service says too bad.
1,Huge waste of time!,"Got the Groupon, went thought their whole process, sent them 4 tapes and waited. For about 10 days, nothing even appeared on their system. I had to call them just to confirm they had received my package. Then another week+ went by and they informed me that they were sending everything back because there was some copyright-protected material in my tapes. So now I have a bunch of Groupon Bucks that I do not want to spend on Groupons, and I'm out about $12 for the package I had to send them.And all they had to to is make me sign a waiver for the copyrighted material, and we would have been fine, since I won't be showing any of it outside of my house. If only they had done that, they would get to keep their money and I would continue doing business with them.This is not a very intelligent and customer-centered company. Do not trust them with your videos."
1,Sloppy work and not worth the hassle,"I have used this service about half a dozen times. Some tape conversions have been fine but others have been performed poorly. My most recent experience: Part of my two hour tape was not transferred. I had to return the tape to have the conversion redone and I enclosed a detailed letter explaining that only part of the tape was transferred to the DVD. The second transfer came back, with even less of the tape converted and misspellings in the custom description I supplied to be printed on the DVD and box. I assumed that an order being reprocessed would have received at least a little extra attention, not less.I don't want to waste any more time having the conversion attempted for a third time and I would be extrememly nervous now about entrusting an irreplaceable tape to this company."
1,Use a local photo shop instead,"Yes Video is awful. My slides were old and all they did was transfer them to a DVD. I got a message included with my order that said ""poor quality; archival use only"". Do you think they could have called me BEFORE charging me $200. for the work?? They do state that they don't enhance slides, but the wording was not on the brochure. Do your own research before you order from them."
1,Rip Off!,"Potential customers beware! YesVideo basically held me hostage while my online video time expired. I paid them to put my VHS tapes online so that I could edit them and then order DVDs. I didn't realize that there was a time limit to do the editing. While I am familiar with iMovie editing, their process was very foreign and frustrating. I was not able to edit my videos in the time they gave me, and was not willing to pay them more money for an extension on the deadline. I was willing to just have them send me the DVDs ""as is"" until I found out that they wanted to charge me $50.00 for shipping. Bottom line, I spent a lot of money for nothing. I'm back to square one with my old VHS tapes. I do NOT recommend YesVideo."
5,Meyer pens brilliant memoir about being an unemployed exec.,"G. J. (Jerry) Meyer writes an outstanding memoir reagarding his experience seeking work in the modern America of right-sizing and layoffs. Mr. Meyer writes honest and straight-forward prose about corporate life and the tough job market faced by the increasing numbers of people as production gets more efficient and automated. I read this book right after reading Jeremy Rifken's 'The End of Work' (which discusses WHY so many people are un- or under-employed), there should be a Surgeon General's warning about doing this, the experience is nearly too intense. One can only hope that Mr. Meyer gets screwed in some other manner, so that he'll be motivated to write more. Truly an excellent book by a very skilled and compelling writer"
2,Disappointing vocally!,"Am I the only one out there that finds Cummings' performance to be wholly disappointing this time? His voice sounds nasal, and unusually strident. And wouldn't it be cool if we could hear some new material after all these years?"
2,Recording engineer ruins recording.,"Burton Cummings voice may be strong but you can't hear it clearly. It seems as though this is a bootleg recording and the microphones are in the middle of room. The echo makes everything muddy, it's everything that is bad about a live concert. Shoot the sound man, he ruined the artist and stole your money."
5,Fantastic,"I received this album in the mail two days ago and am thrilled with it. I heard Burton Cummings on an Oreida commercial and remembered how much I liked him in the Movie, ""Melanie"". That was when I first heard of him. He was great in it. I managed to find the soundtrack on an album yrs. ago while I was on vacation in Maine at a music store and that was just luck, I think. I had taped the movie Melanie when it was on and it is old and blurry now. I watch it a lot. I was hoping I could get a DVD of that movie someday and a CD of the soundtrack from that movie, but evidently, there are none out. He has his ""own style"" of singing and I am enjoying this CD immensely! Especially like ""I'll Play a Rhapsody"" and Stand Tall. This is a fantastic album and I'd recommend it to anyone. C. Lawless, Tenn."
4,For anyone who's enjoyed Burton in Concert,"This CD contains mostly Guess Who and Burton Cummings ""best of"" hits...but if you've ever seen Burton in concert, or wished you had, this is definately for you. Here is Burton, alone on stage with his piano playing the largest of his own solo hits and those of the Guess Who. PLUS...as an added bonus, you get a live performance of the crowd-favorite ""Maggie Mae"" (IF Gordon Lightfoot's favorite singer was Rod Stewart...). Having been to several concerts on the tour that preceded the CD, I would like to state that this recording truly captures the essence of the concert. Enjoy!"
5,AMAZING film!,This was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. We have never before been exposed to the world of voting in this way. Watch this movie and you'll know EXACTLY why we all need to vote. This movie should be shown is schools across America.
5,great!,just as described. delivered quickly. good deal. songs are great and the ones i wanted. what a voice. Blessed By God for sure!
5,Nice Job TSR,"This book was a much needed help in my setting , left and right I had fighter pc's that wanted to broaden their horizons a little and add destinction to their characters. Well now I have that resource at my desposal and I am quite pleased with my purchase. I really liked the Samarui Kit and the list and explanation of several types of Japaneese weapons. I am most pleased."
4,Ecellent book,"This book includes classes which have not been seen since the mid-1980's in Unearthed Arcana. I got this book hoping that it would have a cavalier kit, which it did. It has many, many more kits, background ideas for characters, and even social situations designed to bring out the most in roleplaying for a fighter. The kits in the book include Amazon(Female only), Barbarian, Beast-Rider, Berserker, Cavalier, Gladiator, Myrmidon, Pirate, Outlaws, Samurai, Savages, and Swashbucklers which always fun for they are women magnets :)"
3,What nobody is mentioning... unless you play AD&D 2e,"This book is outdated. I mistakenly bought one called the Complete Druid. Some of the spells could transfer, some were workable. But for the most part you could not tell what could even be salvaged. If you still play 2e go ahead. But don't fool the rest of us into buying it, as most of the rules not only don't work any more, they were probably changed for a reason."
5,Skippy the elf fights for his life,"This book is a definite must for any AD&D afficianado! I remember this one time, my elf-fighter-mage (12/13/3 level, +3 to hit, +5 reaction roll), assaulted a small hut guarded by a giant three headed goat. Using the combat procedures described in this manual and the +5 helm of brilliance I found in the cave of wonders outside of the swamp of despair, I was able to vanquish the drow queen and her awful minions, including the three-headed goat. An awesome buy! :-))))"
3,Good kits for the experanced player,I enjoy fighter and this book gives me all sorts of Ideas of what play and new kits to make up or addapt.
3,How Ya Livin',"Hmmm.....Many thoughts on Mr. Luckett's How Ya Livin'I definitely liked each and every character. Although Trey was full of himself, he was sure of himself. I liked the fact that he was open and lived life to the fullest. Vince the romantic -my kind of man. Mr. Luckett was quite descriptive in his writing of How Ya Livin'. If anything, this was the result of 3 Stars over 4. The book places you in the midst of the characters lives and you experience their adventures. Boy what a journey....................Hmmm. If you like reading for adventure and you need a good read, read How Ya Livin'. Its worth a 'PEEK'. Can't wait to view on the Big Screen at Magic Johnson's Place. : )"
4,In Living Color,"This book was an interesting read, granted it was like a thousand pages. (exaggeration)but seriously it was good but a bit predictable trey was deemed a sexy man but in the end we all know how he went. but seriously the sex sceens were off the hook i mean they were meant to get the juices flowing. all in all it was good but borrow it from the library instead of buying it."
3,Still on trial,"I bought Emu Oil because read great reviews about acne scar miracles and etc. I'm using this product 2nd week in a row and haven't noticed a big difference. Maybe it's too early to tell who knows?But, Emu oil is great for skin sunburn. Just got back from Dominican Republic with red sunburns and Emu Oil helped to soothe it very fast. This is why I gave it a 3 star."
1,very watery for emu oil,"I've tried three brands of emu oil and this was the worst so far. It was extremely thin and watery. I ended up returning it. Try instead ""Emu Essence Naturals"". It is wonderful -- more expensive but I don't doubt its purity, quality or freshness as I do this product. (I am just a consumer, btw, not affiliated with either company)."
5,singing praises for emu oil,"I first heard of emu oil while reading my Oxygen magazine. One of the cover girls mentioned that she uses it on her skin. So, . . I looked it up Amazon and found that this was the most positively reviewed and made of 100% Emu oil. At first I was a little skeptical I've never heard of anything with the word ""oil"" in it that does not leave you feeling greasy. I first tried it on my face, . . I have acne scars and I was hoping it would help. I used a little on my face and put some on my hair and I was immediately surprised how well this stuff goes right into you skin leaving it so super baby soft. Now I don't know if it will help thicken my hair or help remove my acne scars but I am impressed with the hydration. I deffinitely plan on using it regularily to see how well it works. It IS expensive but because it all natural and not mass produced I'm willing to dish out the money for this product and support the USA farm. This is truly a hidden gem."
4,Super product!,"This product is great for dry skin, also for thin skin of older adults. My husband's hands were constantly bruised. Additionally, his skin tore easily when working out in the yard. When he began applications of the emu oil on a daily basis, both of these problems were greatly lessened."
3,Emu Oil,"Just started using it, do not know the effects, but one thing I did not like is the bottle has no protection seal from the company."
1,My order never arrived,Still waiting for my emu oil to arrive. I've tried emailing the company several times with no reply from them. I will be filing a claim with Amazon to get my money back.Be careful on ordering from this company. Their customer service is non-existent.
3,NOT A MIRACLE PRODUCT FOR ALL!,"I purchased this product based on the high review ratings. I really didnt want to pay $30 for something that may be a flake, but I decided to take a chance. Well I have been using the Pure Emu Oil for almost 3 mos and I have not seen a significant difference in my hair scape bald area. This product does moisturize your hair and make it feel sooooo soft and silky and that's the only reason I gave it 3 stars. But there are cheaper hair lotions out there that does the same thing. [...]"
2,eh,my girlfriend told me to get this for my dandruff. its really expensive and doesnt really do much. if you have dandruff i recommend head and shoulders CONDITIONER. not reg. head and shoulders. that stuff kicks ass
1,Best Trains Book,I have seen $3 paperbacks more informative than this book. Very little variety shown. The book was more about the emergence of early American rails and trains and did not even explore the various types of trains and their origins and places where they are popularly used. I guess the thinness of the book should have been a clue.
1,Silly book with a cute cover and title...,Being a Paris lover I was interested in the premise of the book thinking it would be a cute story. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. The heroine is completely silly and I found myself rolling my eyes constantly at her flighty decisions. Wait for this one on a discount shelf!
3,the goody-goody (...): a study in hypocrisy,"this book began with a whole lot of potential--sisman even had a t.s. eliot reference within the first chapter--but the book fizzled, big time, by page 150 or so. while molly's naivete at first seems charming, 100 pages or so later you just want to slap her for being so stupid, annoying, goody-goody and polly-anna-ish. a novel about such a character would be salvageable, but somehow this chicken-little character manages to sleep with a guy she's met less than 24 hours ago. huh? is this the same character who was freaking out about wearing a RED dress? it just doesn't make sense. i finished the book, mostly to see how ridiculous the ending would be..."
4,Cute story with deep meaning,"I have always wanted to go to Paris and after reading this story I feel like I did. Molly is a wonderful, sensible, level-headed main character who experiences Paris for the first time and through the author's depiction you feel as if it's YOU traveling the streets viewing the wonderful sights. Molly experiences an awful lots in one weekend, but it all turns out pretty amazing and is very life changing for her."
5,"Poor Molly, nieve and trying to learn!","What a great book! Molly is being bullied by her boss when she decides to do something she has never done before, travel. She goes to Paris where the adventure begins. You feel her different emotions as she grows, changes and learns how to relax, let go and enjoy. She does things in Paris that she thought she would never do. She even meets a dreamy French man. This book made me laugh out loud!"
3,Disappointed,"I thought Weekend in Paris was such a disappointment compared to Robyn Sisman's other books. It had no plot, the characters were mundane, and I just completely lost interest halfway through the book. I couldn't wait for the book to end! Hope Robyn's next book is more exciting and realistic."
2,Don't waste your money or time,"What a poorly written book with a foolish, annoying main character. I found that the author made many of the characters appear one way only to have them change and then go back and forth. This book made no sense and was a complete waste of time to read. In fact, I did not even finish it."
1,"Wait, haven't I seen book-obsessed girl seeks to be a heroine before?","The main character in this novel is just like Catherine Moreland, only I don't think that you're supposed to be laughing at her and there's no Henry Tilney.And it was so cliche and stereotyped, to boot. I could tell what was going to happen before it even happened."
2,Not the worst not the best,It was okay. I love Paris and was interested in revisiting it through a young woman's eye. I had been her age the first time I went to Paris and while I could relate to the clubs and atmosphere I found it could have been better. The characters could have had more depth and I kept thinking how much better the book could have been with a more skilled writer.
5,Fast and unpredictable,"Adventures abound and in a short weekend, Molly learns a lot about herself and what she really wants. I was entertained by the unpredictable events as well as the character development that took place. The descriptions of being in a foreign place were also very good. It was a nice relief from the chick lit where you can guess the ending half way through the book."
3,My own Weekend in Paris,"Absolutely true story... Two weeks ago, I had to go away to Paris for the weekend due to a family matter. I had 3 hours to pack, dress, and get to the airport. To avoid dying from boredom, I rummaged through by book collection for something to keep me sane. And, there it was ""Weekend in Paris"".I must say I was completely entertained. There was no time to buy a guide book and it was fun looking and encountering the landmarks the author described in her book. She also noted a lot of French words and phrases which actually came in handy.If you find yourself jet setting through Paris for the weekend, I would totally recommend this book. If you're looking for something with depth and meaning, keep looking!PS. Just in case you're wondering, my weekend was nothing like Molly's."
2,Mildly Disappointing,"I read a bunch of great reviews about this book before I bought it, so I thought I better post a comment that's more realistic. This book is easy (and at points, fun) to read, but it wavers between funny and dumb. The ending leaves something to be desired, and everything is a little too neatly wrapped up with coincidences. It certainly does not make me want to go to Paris (except for the Rodin Museum). Weekend in Paris strives for the tone of a Sophie Kinsella novel without quite getting it. Read Confessions of a Shopoholic instead."
3,Great for reading at the Doctor's office,"While I enjoyed the humor, it didn't suck me in. I love books that you look up and it 3am. I took more than a week to finish the book, just because I couldn't stay focused in the beginning. I have enjoyed other books by Robyn Sisman, but this one left me annoyed at the end."
1,SAVE your money!,"Reading this book was like watching paint dry. I forced myself to continue, because I just knew something was going to happen (NOT!) but nothing did. I hope this review helps."
5,: ) : ) THIS BOOK IS THE BOMB ( : ( :,"I dont usually give reviews on books, but this book was one ofthe best books I've ever read. Im fourteen years old, and I could not only understand this book, but also it instantly became one of my favorites. I love the way that Molly stands up for herself. The only thing I wish happens with this book is a sequel. This book is awesome and is in my top five fav books. It is awesome. READ IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"One of the weakest, dumbest, most inane heroines ever","She has the sensibilities and personality of someone from the 19th century. Completely without wit or charm or intelligence. The reader is *told* that Molly's smart because she's been to university, but there's absolutely no evidence of it. In fact, she's perhaps one of the stupidest heroines I've every had the displeasure of reading about. Not to mention that fact that she's spineless. I felt like kicking her."
3,"Sweet, if sometimes implausible","This is a perfect plane or beach book. Sisman's strength is creating interesting and likeable characters. She's not as good at plotting, and some of the 'coincidences' in this book are hard to believe.Molly is a charming character though, and it's fun following her coming-of-age in Paris."
2,Read it as a Travelogue...,"I do like Robyn Sisman's books. I've read most of it. However, this book lacks intensity and depth of characters and plot. The plot is too contrived, against all odds, characters from the past pop up with synchronised speed to tie up loose ends. It goes totally against the natural rhythm of the pace of normal life.All the characters seem on high, running on a carpa diem or seize the day mentality.One redeeming point is that it captures the Parisian bohemian spirit well, the French laissez-faire and their hedonist attitude on leisure pursuits. It reads more like a travelogue. If you have never been to Paris or have been and liked it, you may wish to enjoy some armchair travel with the vibrant description of Parisian life.I hope the next book by Robyn Sisman would be a big improvement over this one. ""Just Friends"", her earlier book remains my favorite and hope she can surpass her brillant mastery of ""Just Friends""."
2,Light weight nonsense,The book description for 'Weekend in Paris' promises 'an adventure that defies...imagination'. This book actually delivers a predictable storyline with one dimensional characters. Not recommended.
1,Wrong Picture,"Looks like Amazon may have the wrong picture of this product. From what I can tell (looking on other sites), this is not an internal card. Just do a bit of research and be certain of what you are buying. Maybe they will update the pic and all will be well. :-)I don't have one so really don't know how they perform."
1,Does not work with Snow Leopard,"I own and 'used' the Sandisk 12-in-1 card reader with MAC's Tiger (10.4.11), Leopard (10.5) with NO problems. But now with snow leopard it does not see any card inserted in the device. Request for help from Sandisk has ZERO!! The reader works with Parallels V4 on snow leopard so it obvious the MAC-PRO(Dual 2x-intels ca.2007) I own is OK."
1,fast but unreliable,"This card reader works pretty fast, but watch out if you use the unit without the dock. The little USB jack is flimsy and will work itself loose (maybe from the torque of the short USB cord) after a while and I notice intermittent interruptions during file transfers. Last night it corrupted a 2G SD card when it shut down unexpectly during a transfer and all images were unrecoverable even through image recovery software.Needless to say I am not pleasedDo Keep it in the dock and use something with a fixed dongle.This is a piece of JUNK!"
2,Flimsy stand and poorly designed slots,"It's too easy to insert Secure Digital and xD cards at a bad angle. The inside of the slots are actually open so the card can easily fit in at an angle. I usually have to try a few times to get xD and SD cards to insert correctly. I'm worried that I'll eventually damage the card or the reader because of this.It also would not fully read files off my 2GB Corsair Secure Digital card. Images would come off corrupted or incomplete. Luckily, I have a spare Crucial SD card reader which works fine."
4,USB connection problem,"I bought this reader since it is compatible with the new type M xD-picture cards. It worked all right with my 1GB xD type M card.One thing I didn't like is that the USB connector on the reader is a bit deeper than others, so no USB cable I have fit properly. If you don't want to use the stand, you have to use the very short provided cable (maybe along with an extension cable)."
4,Card reader,"This card reader has so far been reliable and hasn't has any problems, although it is VERY slow with RAW images, esp. compared with the lexar."
5,Compact and easy to use,"When I bought this, I didn't do any research. I just went out and picked it up. The first thing I liked was how compact it was. You can hide it anywhere on your desk. Also, the tranfer mate is great to use. You just push the button and the wizard comes up asking you what you want to transfer. Excellant product!!"
5,It's nifty,"This is small and unobtrusive on my desk. It works right out of the box--just plug it into the USB port and voila! I mostly just use it for my microSD, but I enjoy knowing I have options with this 12-in-1."
2,Good while it worked.....,Went on the Sand Disk name. Bought the 12 in 1 but really only used one of the 12. Good product while it worked. Died on my at the worst time. Next to impossible to reach anyone to find out about warrenty.Will go with a different brand next time.
4,Nice card reader,This is a very good card reader. No driver installation required. The extra stuff like the automatic download button and the holding base is unnecessary in my opinion.
1,Not For Mac!,I ordered this based on the good reviews. And it is probably a good product for use with a Windows machine. The software isn't for Mac at all and none of the features works with Mac.I tried it anyway and it was a total disaster. The ONLY thing you can do is drag an image to the desktop. My little $2 no name CF reader works waaaay better. It's too late to return it due to the way it was packaged from the manufacturer. So I'm giving it to a young man that works for me. It was a total loss. It is a Windows world.
3,USB Cable TOO SHORT!,"This product would get 5 stars, if the USB cables weren't so short.The cable connected to the cradle is only 39"" long. Most desks are 30"" tall. It is simply not long enough to reach from the back of a desktop located underneath the desk to a comfortable spot on top of the desk. STUPID WAY TO SAVE A FEW CENTS, SANDISK!!!The device comes with a USB cable for laptops, but that too is only 6"" long!Also, the USB cable on the cradle cannot be replaced with a longer cable -- permanently attached cable. A USB cable extender could probably be used.The mini-USB plug on the device itself is a bit recessed with a narrow opening, so most normal USB cables would probably not be able to plug into it.Aside from these STUPID shortcomings, the device works perfectly fine.I might return it, just because I can't get it to reach my desk!"
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH VISTA,"If you use XP and not Vista, I highly recommend this device. I would have given it 5 stars if it was compatible. I am giving it 1 star, because it is not clearly labelled on the package or on this product page. This is the first item I am having to return."
1,Computer crash,"I purchased this product because of the multiple good reviews. Though it should have been able to have been installed on my Windows 98 second edition, my attempt at installing the software crashed the computer. Dell was able to get it running after a very lengthy service call. They suggested that I get the Sandisk support group to guide me through the installation process but the same thing happened again. Neither Sandisk nor Dell has been able to get my computer running again except in Safe Mode. I have returned the product to Amazon and have purchased a new computer. Whether the problem was my aging operating system or the product I do not know, but I certainly won't risk this happening again. I'd have to rate this 0 stars, but this selection is not available."
1,I Thought it Would Work,"I bought the Sandisk ImageMate 12 in 1 at Wal-mart and having read reviews here, I expected it to work well. It didn't. Installation instructions were incorrect for Windows 98SE, but I did finally get it installed. I renamed my files, it never happened. No way to put files where I would have chosen. The reader, plugged in and doing nothing, slowed my computer to a haphazard crawl. I'm going to try something else."
4,SD port easy to damage,"I am generally happy with this reader (+5). It has good speed, and read/write every card I throw at it. It has been working really well, until read-only detection pin in the SD port gets bent(-1).All it takes is one slightly misaligned insertion and the pin will get pushed from the side to the bottom of the port. At first, the port doesn't even detect card insertion. But I think I have ""fixed"" it so that the port is read-only from now on.You can look into it and see if there is a half-an-inch metalic strip at the bottom, extending from the left. That strip may not have been bent enough to allow the card to be fully inserted. In that case, you may either cut it (hard) or simply push the pin with a screwdriver until it lays flush at the bottom. This solved my problem."
5,"Fast set up, handles the most common formats, fast transfers.","Worked perfectly out of the box. Included software displays the card type loaded in the slots. I use four different cards (CF II, SD, microSD and memory stick) and they all work perfectly with this device."
3,"Works ok, software crap","This card reader reads all the types of cards I have tried - xD card, sd, and cf. But the software was so bad that I had to uninstall it. It just didn't work right and it screwed up my computer operation. Everything seems ok now that I have taken it off. I just use the software that came with windows xp to view the pictures and trasfer them."
5,Look ma ....no drivers needed and works great in Windows x64,"Was looking for a new reader that would work in Windows x64 . Tried my brothers slightly older 88-A15 and it worked no problem . Fiquered the 89-AI5 should do also work in x64 and it does !!! No drivers needed in x64 and it works great . Amazon had the best price going w/feee ship , so it was a no brainer to purchase here .Happy Windows x64 user (and Amazon customer) =)"
3,Potential problem with large SD card (4GB),"I used this product without any problem for a long time until I tried to use it on a Ritek 4GB SD card. When I tried writting some data to the card, the data got corrupted. I tried this multiple time. I ended up changing to another brand of card reader (Q-stor) that could handle large SD card."
1,Won't Read Lexar Memory Stick Duo Pro 1GB,"I purchased this product for the great form factor and the ability to read Memory Stick Duo cards (short ones) without using the adapter. However, this product would not read my Lexar Memory Stick Duo Pro 1GB card even after contacting SanDisk support. My digital camera uses the Lexar memory card fine and another multi-card reader I have also reads it fine. But for some reason the Lexar memory card is not compatible with the SanDisk reader. The SanDisk reader read my Sony branded Memory Stick Duo Pro cards fine but it didn't like the Lexar brand."
2,Watch out for the older model,"Pros:- generally good build, and desk stand is greatcons:* does not work with all usb cords. some really just dont register. just ridiculous.* using apart from the stand is retarded- it has a extra deep plug, so many standard usb cords simply either wont work or wont have pins long enough* dog slow- will never be taken for a speed demon, at all* older model looks EXACTLY the same, has the same part number (minus the three digits)functions badly* cannot do card to card transfer- what a wasteIf you can, stay away. More money definitely does not mean better in this case."
5,Perfect!,"I was very hesitant to buy this product but I really needed a faster way to transfer my images from my CF cards. I use Windows 7 and didn't have a problem using this product, the moment I inserted the card in the reader, within seconds I managed to transfer the images without any problem!"
3,"OK, could be simpler","When opening the package, there is a warning sticker on the USB cable that you need to install the Button Application. After doing so, i found that the Button Application kept popping up on screen when i was trying to simply transfer files from the USB drive to my computer.Bottom line: If you only want to transfer files using Windows Explorer, just install the drivers (look in the driver directory on the CD).If you need this device to transfer the files for you to some magical location on your computer hard drive, install the Button Application (which installs the drivers for you behind the scenes).-ted"
5,Excellent product.,"This is the second card reader I have purchased. This one is very easy to use, and fast."
1,Puked and Died,"My SanDisk reader worked okay for about 18 months, then simply died. I only use it about once per month on average to transfer pictures from my digital camera SD Card to my PC, so it was not like it was overworked. I find it unacceptable that a solid state device getting extremely light use should simply die. After a lot of trouble shooting, checking USB ports, drivers, etc., no dice. I will be buying a replacement, but it will be a different brand."
3,"Modest quality, decent performance","Lasted 32 months (I looked up the shipping invoice from amazon when it died this evening) before the usb connector inside the unit finally gave out. Up to that, though, it worked reasonably well and the ability to pop the unit out of its mount and bring it along traveling."
2,Irritatingly fussy!,This is the only card reader I've ever had that I didn't like. It was always hard to get the cards in and usually took several tries before I could get them in straight. I finally gave it away and got a Kingston which works far better and is a lot cheaper.
3,It's Alright.,I've had trouble getting my memory cards to go in correctly. Especially the bigger ports.
1,Did not work with both of my computers,"I bought this unit and with my desktop and laptop and after installing the cd (which the direcions say u should) it would not work at all. Occassionally, there would be blinks of the light going off but then it would die. I dont know whether this was a defective unit or its just did not work, but i returned it within an hour. I checked the Sandisk website and after following the directions the technical support gave me it still didn't work. I own a dell inspiron 8600 and a cyberpower system."
1,Poor quality,I have been using sandisk porducts particulary their compact flash cards and when I needed a reader I bought this one. It worked 3 times and died. It has to be one of the most poorly made readers I've ever used. It indicated no software was needed but that not the case. It has to be unplugged everytime you use it.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT ITS GARBAGE!
2,Fie Upon It,"For the first two months I was using this device, it worked well. After that, half the time it wouldn't read the card data, and I'd have to putz around with it to get it to work. Finally, last week it just quit. Nothing I tried would get it to read, even though the lights were indicating that it was on and working. Into the trash it goes after only one year of light use."
4,Great little product,I plug this little baby into my computer and it recognizes the unit instantly. I did not have to use the cd that it comes with. I am running windows 2000. No problem encountered so far. The greatest thing about this product is that you can tranfer information directly from one drive to the next without copying to your hard drive. Very handy little gadget.
3,High speed 2 gig. cards,This reader works great on an iMac computer with no installed drivers. It is fine for reading 16 Meg. to 1 Gig cards. It will not recognize a 2 gig. San Disk card. I have to down the photos using my camera. It is just fast as using the reader with smaller cards but not as convenient.I do not recommend this reader if you intend to use high capacity memory cards.
4,Happy again getting pictures onto lap top,This was recommended by a friend of mine who is a computer expert. The Sandisk ImageMate is easy to install and easy to use. I am very happy with this item
2,Defective product,"My son took my card reader to college. I replace it with this one. Worked fine for my CompactFlash ll but when I used my wife's SD card it wouldn't read it. Although I discovered this after the 30 day return time, Amazon agreed to replace it."
1,Disappointed,"After about 6 months of working properly this reader began to fail on me. The first signs of trouble began when I found I had to reinsert my 4gb CF Cards multiple times before the reader would recognize them. This was intermittent. Over the past month, I can't get it to read any of my 4gb CF cards. I get formatting errors. Now, it won't read anything but my 512mb card. I shoot in RAW with my Canon 5D and I need much more memory than 1/2gb.I've tried two other readers and these 4gb cards read just fine on this same computer. I'm now stepping down and purchasing the SDDR 92. If it fails, I'm kissing SanDisk goodbye."
3,"Not User Friendly, but OK","I got this because I have a bunch of digital frames and have several SD cards to use. The things I dont like are the software included (I uninstalled it after using it twice), but that is OK because it works with windows without it. It adds 4 drives to your computer if it has a card in it or not, making you search for what you just plugged in. The card slots are difficult to seat the card in. They are universal so the slots support a bunch of different sized cards and they dont seat firmly. The good thing is that this will read just about anything you put in it and it works with little effort."
4,Versatile Reader,"Works great with at least Compact Flash and MemoryStick PRO Duo (the only media I have). Only objection is the USB connector is recessed, thus requiring the included but very short cable to connect it. Standard mini-USB connectors do not fit."
4,Very fast but need a longer cable,"I bought this reader to transfer pictures from my 10Mp digital camera that uses SD card. The installation of the SW that came with the reader was a snap. After you plug in the reader, it displays 4 removable drive in my computer. When you plug in the SD card, the installed SW will automatically start on Windows XP.The transfer speed is excellent. It transferred 85 MB worth of files in 13 seconds = 6.5 MB/sec.There is only one minor issue to point out. The USB cable included with the device is a bit short. I wound up buying an USB extension cable. But the reader does provide an extra cable (very short) so you can take the reader with you."
2,"CF pin shorted, rendering entire reader useless","I've had this reader for a few years, and it was working well, but mostly used it with SD cards. Recently I inserted a CF card, and after investigation, realized that one of the CF pins were bent.After doing some google research, it seems that CF pins bending can happen in readers in cameras (ie. canon 5d!), etc... so while the pin bending may be a defect/weak point of the CF design, I was disappointed to find that I could no longer read SD cards (seems like when the pin shorted, it took out the entire reader).I give 2 stars because it worked for so long. I've since ordered an individual SD+ reader, and CF reader, to avoid having to replace the entire unit in the future (at the sacrifice of a convenient all-in-one tool)."
2,Old technology,I bought it because it looked identical to the one I have at work and it is great. Called ScanDisk because it didn't seem to work right. Found out that it was an old model and won't read SDHC cards only SD. There are hardly any SD cards to be bought.
4,It works,"This card reader works as advertised for a number of formats. The stand that it sits in is functional, but a bit unstable until the cord stops trying to roll itself up from the packing.Works as advertised. No other complaints."
5,SanDisk,"Easy to use, great versatility for card reading. Sits nicely in a cradle, taking up less space but I would like to be able to remove it from the cradle without losing wire contact."
1,Excess CPU Usage problem,"I purchased the SanDisk 12-in-1 Card Reader to use with a new Sony camera with memory stick. After installing the unit and software, I noticed my computer slowed down. After much searching, I found that the unit causes the CPU usage to go from an average of abou 5% to in excess of 50% with what appeared to be a related program slow down. I am forced to shut down the software at bootup and then forced to start the software to use the unit. It appears that the software is intended to be active whenever the computer is running. I am very disapponted with the reader and will scrap the unit in favor of a more user friendly product."
1,Bad news,"The original iteration (the vertical version) of this 12-in-1 card reader crapped out on me within 90 days, wouldn't read or present any card, in any slot, of any size.Amazon's 30-day return policy didn't help me a bit, even though the item had a two-year manufacturer's warranty. There's no place on this site I can discuss this issue with an Amazon rep, at least that I could find.I had to buy another card reader with overnight delivery to get projects accomplished.I've spent a lot of money with Amazon over the years and their intractibility with this issue is distressing. Amazon is convenient, and often best-priced...but I'll be shopping more carefully in the future."
1,This card reader stinks,"Don't bother purchasing this device. Every time I put in my cards, they would only read intermittently. I took about 30 min to download photos that should have taken about 2 min. I have had similar problems with other card readers although this one was the worst. The best solution, don't bother with card readers and just hook your camera up directly to your USB plug with a cable that fits your device. Always works fast and easy."
1,Don't Believe The Hype!!,Sprayer RUSTED OUT within a year!!! Totally FALSE and MISLEADING advertisement regarding the durability of this sprayer!!!
2,cannot upload video to computer,"I cannot upload any video from the camera (a powershot A610) to computer. I can only infer that this is a card problem since I've tried uploading into other computers and have no luck, and also the photos upload fine, just not the video. I've even tried to browse the card by folder instead of using Window's photo uploading tool, still does not work. Anyone else have the same problem?"
1,Gets stuck in camera,"The memory itself works fine, but the card gets stuck in my casio digital camera. my ScanDisk card works fine, but the viking doesn't and it is near impossible to remove from my camera. I am going to see if I can return it either for a refund or for another disk."
3,Can't use with older model MP3 players....,"The primary purpose I purchased this product was to add more memory to my RIO S10 MP3 player. After having difficulties installing it, I later learned that my MP3 player would not recognize anything higher than 128sd. Downer!"
1,Do not order this product from amazon,"The shipping take very very long , I try buying this for mywife business trip , she was already back from the trip,Amazonhas not shipped to me."
3,Too slow for video,"The Viking 512 MB card performs flawlessly when taking pictues. However, when taking video, such as on my Canon S2 IS at the highest resolution, this memory card is way too slow. After no more than about 10 seconds, the video will stop so it can finish writing what was captured. With many of the new digital cameras that now provide higher quality video, a faster memory card (a Canon rep recommended a minimum of 40x) is a must."
5,"Works great, no problems.",I have used this memory card in my Kodak camera and Bonzai card reader. No problems with speed or accuracy. Great value!
5,Camera Memory,"So far, we've been able to store more pics on our digital camera and also create video's and store them at the same time. It's great!"
4,A LITTLE SMALLER THAN EXPECTED,"THIS ITEM IS VERY NICE! SMALLER THAN EXPECTED BUT HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PIECE. IT'S A LITTLE SMALLER THAN A QUARTER BUT NOT SMALLER THAN A NICKEL (IN BETWEEN). MY HUSBAND WILL LOVE IT FOR HIS NECKLACE. OVERALL THE QUALITY AND DETAIL IS GREAT, JUST SMALL."
5,wonderful wonderful wonderful!!!,"if you are a mclean fan, this is a must to own. the songs are smooth and flowing and don's sultry voice sounds even better w/ the jordanaires behind him.you will find yourself reaching for this one again and again."
3,Good gangster movie,This is a good gangster movie with a good twist. The movie title should have been renomered.A good Warren Baxter and Myrna Loy movie. Even Nat Pendleton is good in this movie.
5,GULFSIDETREASURES,"THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES OF MYRNA'S MOVIES. THEY JUST DON'T MAKE THESE KIND OF MOVIES ANYMORE - LOVED IT, VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE THE PRICING TOO!"
5,Complete i-Net+ Coverage Starting With the Basics,Mr. Byrne did an excellent job of covering i-Net+ objectives from the very basic to more advanced levels. I recommend this book to any one thinking about i-Net+ certification. The book design and organization does a good job in aiding readers' understanding of the material.
2,Very Vague and incomplete.,It is a good book for beginners and a starting point. You will need another good Complete book to pass the exam. I took the exam and it only cover 15% of the Exam objectives. It does a good job of explaining terminology.
1,Too much info -- CD is full of junk.,"Don't get me wrong -- this book while decent, just seemed to get off track and didnt in my opinion FOCUS on the exam topics. While some have said good things about the cd -- i think it is full of useless stuff, and the exam questions where an afterthought, as compared to what is actually on the exam."
5,Great Resource and preparation guide! A++,"The iNet+ Certification Study System is a great resource for learning all about how Internet works! The topics match the exam objectives perfectly and completely. This is not just a good study guide however. Anyone interested in knowing how Internet technologies work should read this book. Its the only one I've found that is easy to read but at the same time gives an in-depth look into how the Internet operates. I passed the test using just this book and I had very little previous Internet experiance. I now feel capable of actually ""doing"" Internet related services for my company. The CD also contains a number of great software programs including a Web server, Web Page editor, and e-mail server that I have up and running in my home in less than 2 hours, thanks completely to Mr. Byrne's clear step-by-step explainations. A++"
2,"Nice wallet, really bulky","Very nicely made leather case, however it is very bulky and does protrude from the belt. I went back to using the low profile belt clip supplied by my HP iPAQ."
4,Steve Bug - The Other Day,"_The Other Day_ shows Steve Bug moving away from the deep house of his earlier productions and more towards the minimal techno that mark his DJ sets. ""Loverboy"" skates by on the beat and a slow build that leads into the vocal sample, while ""White Times"" and ""The Spray"" have electro feels to get your body popping. ""At the Front"" keeps things spare, but groovy, and ""Electric Blue"" turns up the feedback. Both ""Rhythm Divine"" and ""Switch"" maintain chunky beats, but it's the crisp production of ""So I"" that grabs at your ears. Same goes for the long, luscious tones that enter ""Soulin' Deep"" halfway through. ""Cheesy Krust"" takes the album out with a nice slice of downtempo. Nice, for sure."
1,Not the book that it proclaims to be!,"When I received Early Mormon Documents (Volume 1), I expected an academically researched book by Dan Vogel, that gave a balanced, unbiased, and even approach to early Mormon documents. The first clue that something was terribly wrong was when the book's dedicatory page included names like Fawn Brodie, who is known for her acrimony towards The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. So it went with the historical documents of the time, presenting letters and court documents from fundamentally negative perspectives, mainly from those who sought the destruction of early church leaders. Many document are prejudicial, tilted by Vogel's animosity he feels toward Joseph Smith and those associated with him."
3,YOU HAVE MANY WALLY'S?,"An alien (Barry Stokes) meat eater lands on earth and takes human form as one of his victims. He is taken in as a house guest in an English country manor by a pair of lesbians. The two women are a bit odd. Jessica (Glory Annen) the not too shy owner of the estate inherited it from her parents. Jo (Sally Faulkner) worked there and stayed on as the alpha female in the relationship.The alien is socially inept. Jessica is fond of him, ""He's very attractive...for a man"" to the dismay of Jo who suspects something is up. The film has slow scenes and takes time to build up to a climax that wasn't worth the wait. Low budget soft core sci-fi from the 70's. A drive-in movie flick.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Glory Annen, Sally Faulkner, Barry Stokes) girl/girl sex, cat fight."
3,A zombie from beyond space,"A zombie from beyond space is found in an English backyard and is invited to stay in with a lesbian couple. The girls dress him up as a woman, which does not seem to affect him in the least, but provides us with a truly strange yet successful film. The story, which borrows from such various sources as THE MAN WHO FELL ON EARTH (Roeg), CUL-DE-SAC (Polanski) and STRAW DOGS (Peckinpah), is clever enough to take on board such themes as racism, sexism, love, jealousy and betrayal. With just three characters, an unusual setting and a fittingly realistic treatment, it makes for a very intriguing experience. Norman J. Warren's best ?"
3,Product review,"The band is a little stiff, the metal band may be better. Overall, this is a good product."
4,compost hole digger,"good tool--had to sharpen blades -good price and quality- i use it to compost all kitchen left overs. I dig a hole around the drip line of my fruit trees and around my garden and bury kitchen scraps (paper , coffee grinds, bones , etc.) in the hole. Composted in few weeks. It's called posthole composting."
5,Nice,"simple tool that works well for what it is designed. dug 4 - 2.5' holes in about 15 minutes in rocky, clay."
2,Handles are the weak spot,I broke the handle on my second hole. Be careful when using this item. need more words to complete review more more more more
5,A dark and fascinating story...,"Joan Aiken sets many of her children's books in a slightly off-kilter Victorian world, and this is one of them. Lucas and Anna-Marie are orphans in the care of a miserly, grim old man who owns carpet-making factories. After a terrible accident, the two children have to survive on their own, and this takes them through the dark alleyways, factories, and even sewers of the nearby town. Some parts are quite scary, and others are strange in a larger-than-life kind of way, including the descriptions of the machines in the factories. The characters are wonderful, though, and as always, there is a sense of atmosphere in Ms. Aiken's books that I've found no where else. Highly recommended."
4,"Excellent Companion To The Original 'MUSIC FOR FILMS', excpt","Most if not all of the exclusive tracks from the oop 'INSTRUMENTAL' box set are on this compilation. I need to point out that there is a track repeated twice by mistake. Track 18 which is listed as 'CLIMATE STUDY' is actually 'APPROACHING TAIDU', which also happens to be track 20. It seems Astralwerks has screwed up again like on the first pressings of 'ANOTHER GREEN WORLD'. You may want to hold off on buying this until a second pressing is done to add the correct track."
3,"""More"" Music, Not Really ""New"" Music for Films","When I saw that this was coming out, I was immediately excited, since the original MUSIC FOR FILMS was such a unique collection at the time of its release. This latest version (and some of the tracks are just that -- versions of earlier releases) doesn't break any new ground, but fans of Eno will likely want to have a copy for their collections anyway. The pieces vary but all possess a somewhat cinematic approach (not as in John Williams and action movie soundtracks), setting a mood and a tone that can be calming or jarring. Most of the pieces are in the ""incidental"" vein, lasting only a minute or two. It works as an extension of the original MUSIC FOR FILMS, but certainly doesn't build much on the promise of that ground-breaking release."
3,"Very Familiar, Strange...","Most of the tracks here sound very familiar, being either remixes of earlier instrumental tracks or tracks that were already released on the ""Instrumentals"" boxed set.I'd probably give the set 4 or 5 stars if these were the first I'd heard of them, but anybody who half-follows Eno's career will find this a deja-vu experience."
1,Astralwerks mastering errors,"Does anyone have the final word on the degree to which Astralwerks (sic) have screwed up these Eno 'remasters'?'Another Green World' has the first bars of 'Everything merges with the night' missing, 'Climate Study' is missing from this release (More Music For Films), and someone on the Amazon review of 'Music For Films' states that the intro to 'Quartz' on that album is also truncated. Are Astralwerks just a bunch of amateurs or something? Eno must be well pleased with this mess.."
2,Couldn't get into it.,"The story line was good but the dialogue ruined it for me. It was unnatural and stilted in my opinion. For example, I don't know any man, let alone a football player, who says ""Lordy"" or ""lovely"" all the time. The author wrote as though she was expecting her English teacher to grade her. Rachel was a sexy vixen one minute (and even then her dialogue was flowery) and a very proper speaking society matron the next. If the dialogue had been more normal or natural it would have been easier to relate to the characters."
1,You call this electronic? BULL!,"I think I know what electronic classical music is, considering I made an album called Kulture. This does not sound electronic, if it does, it uses drums = not good. It sounds way too classical."
4,cute doll,Overall a great doll except her hair color is not brown as I expected. It's more of an orange/light brown color which I don't like.
5,nice doll,I was looking for a nice doll for my little one. i got this one when she was 9 months. i would say this was little bit big for her to handle at that time. now she is 15 months and this is her favorite one. my only thing is her hair. babies can pluck them. for that i put a cap to the doll!!! Overall I'm satisfied with the buy.
4,"cute, pretty, functional, not too durable","got this item friday, and already by monday the zipper pull has fallen off and there is a hole in the doll's right arm. daughter loves it, has fun with it, and will hopefully learn from it. the craftsmanship is a 5 out of 10. granted i can mend the arm and sew the pull back on, but after 3 days of play i don't think it's normal for a doll to be in need of repair."
1,warped on bottom when exposed to heat.,This is my lowest score for any product ever on Amazo. You get what you pay for but a pot should not warp. You may not notice it on a gas stove but on a flat service it bows in the middle. Maybe I got a reject but have had it beyone the return time frame.
3,Not totally satisfied.,The lid does not have a tight fit. Have to push sides of pan together to get lid to fit properly. Was hoping for something more sturdy. Would not order again.
1,Bat is not durable,This was a nice bat for about 1 1/2 months. After that bat cracked. Sent for a replacement warranty bat which cracked after one month. Miken did nothing to replace or refund a second time. Don't purchase from Miken.
2,Derivista Journalism,"For someone whose main forays to seattle were to buy Indonesian antiques, A sharp anti globalism position seems the height of opportunism, even for an opportunist such as Cockburn. He = actually never bothered to set foot in the tear gas choked area---preferring his minion MR St Clair to do such tedious work--- Cockburn builds on a long history of absentee journalism to concoct yet another volume based on his columns which were fundamentally written by other people, and informed by a political analysis out of date 15 years ago. This old naderista should be turned out to pasture, or sent back to Ireland where he can ruminate on how great his dad was."
2,bad reproductions,the reproductions are low contrast and not very nice -- i'd rather have photocopies! will look for a better copy...
2,Photos were not the quality I thought they'd be.,"I was expecting crispy photos of professional quality with good levels of contrast to define edges, variation, etc. of the forms photographed. Instead most of the photos were somewhat blurry and of low-contrast, mostly grays, leaving depth to be inferred and not readable. I admit that I'm disappointed."
4,Connie's review,"Great, portable reference and inspirational book for the creative photographer or artist. Not as extensive as the original, now out of print, hardcover book by Blossfeldt, but a good alternative."
3,Good for the price,"The quality of the printed images is not very good. I was hoping for glossy paper and crisp images. The paper used was not high quality, and the images are somewhat blurry. However, for the price, I think it is fine, but I forsee using it more as a reference to find better reproductions of images I like rather than as a book that I would enjoy perusing regularly."
3,It's possible you already have these images,"There's nothing here which can't be found on other, larger Corel collections--and quite a bit which you get for free by buying Corel software. Still, if you don't have either, the images are sufficiently well-photographed and the price is reasonable. Get it if your image library is sparse on food and you don't have other Corel libraries. Be warned, though, that the images are VERY generic. If you have a restaurant or catering business, it's unlikely you'll be able to find images that represent your own food well enough to use in brochures or the like. This collection is meant for the non-food-service-professional who just needs a few filler images of things."
5,Enjoyable movie from a reliable supplier,"DeeVeeDees shipped our ""Anne of Green Gables"" immediately. It arrived quickly in excellent condition with no problems. We have enjoyed the 3-part boxed set. Rene Ohashi's breathtaking cinematography captures the outstanding acting and the beautiful P.E.I. scenery. I highly recommend both the movie and DeeVeeDees."
5,Anne of Green Gables Trilogy Box Set,Anne is such a wonderful character that should be a MUST for every woman to share with the young girls in her life. The tales of her life as she grows are wonderfully inspiring. You will be very pleased with the box set & should seriously consider book purchases.
5,Great series,"Not only do my husband and I enjoy these, but the grandkids love them. What's not to like if the whole family can watch together!,"
4,"Wonderful, but","I love these movies and enjoyed the first two immensely, but the third one, although titles correctly on the dvd was not the third movie, but the first one again. They put the wrong one on the disk."
2,Box Set Damaged,These DVDS were in great working order and are just like off TV. They are old and picture quality is older. For some that might be an issue but I wanted just what I had as a kid! The Amizon packaing was fine but the cases the DVDS came in where damaged and broken which leaves me to believe they were broken before shipping. SAD for all that money.
4,Anne of Green Gables Trilogy Box Set (3 Discs),I have recieved this in good condition the box was a little concave but I recieved it in five days by standard shipping.
3,"Recieved two dvd's showing the first part, missing third part","I love the story so much I can not give it a bad rating. I was so excited about seeing the story of Anne of Green Gables again. I enjoyed it as a kid and was even more excited about seeing the third part of the trilogy. As I put the third part in the dvd player, I realized that the dvd was actually the first part of the story. I had two dvd's of the first part, and the third part of the story was missing. I was very disapointed."
1,This ought to be 0 Stars,"So based on the 1 or even 2 star ratings by others, I am hesitant to purchase this boxed set. I won't regret it now by not buying it because DVDs should never have that problem. We've had DVDs for like what? Almost 20 years? But to have them be not very functional is just ridiculous. Seriously, if they are going to continue producing these, at least maybe go back to VHS since someone's already mentioned that those still somehow have higher quality. Anyways, I'll be content with repurchasing a new set of the books instead since books are generally better than the movies."
1,Manufacturer's boo boo,"I ordered and received the first boxed set in record time (3 days). Watched the 1st and 2nd discs (Anne of Green Gables and the Sequel). When I went to watch the 3rd disc (The Continuing Story), it turned out to be an exact copy of the 1st disc. I notified Amazon and they immediately sent out a new boxed set, which I received in three days. Lo and behold, the 2nd boxed set had the same problem as the first set (another duplicate of the 1st disc). I called Amazon, who helped me through the process of returning both sets, postage free, and when they had received them, they issued me another gift card to replace the one I had used.I have since ordered the three discs individually from Amazon, and expect I will have them by the first of the week. I am grateful for all the help Amazon gave me in resolving this manufacturing error and am looking forward to finally viewing The Continuing Story."
1,Frustrating,Nothing like watching your favorite movies in the world... only to pop in the last DVD and see they gave you the wrong one...I received the wrong dvd as the last one... so couldn't find out what in the world happens by way of watching it.And I couldn't return it.... so I'll suggest you may see if you can find other buyers to get this product form so the same doesn't happen to you.
5,Classics,A classic storyline that can be enjoied by all ages. A story that we can now enjoy time and time again.
2,Anne of Green Gable Trilogy Box Set,This was a gift for my Daughter's Birthday. Amazon sent it promptly and in great condition. Unfortunately the product itself was defective. The 3rd DVD was a repeat of the 1st. It was miss marked. Amazon's return was easy and I was able to print the return postage to apply to the box. They quickly sent me a new DVD Set and once again it had the same defect. I returned it using the same postage method and asked for a refund which was immediately credited to my charge card. Unfortunately the problem is from the DVD supplier and not Amazon's fault. I will again order from Amazon because of their prompt delivery service and customer service policies.
5,wonderful,this was bought as a gift for my neice. I have loved this set before and wanted her to enjoy it too. She has not seen it but when she does I hope she will love it as much as I do.
5,Excellent family videos,"These are great for family viewing. Some family oriented movies have too much feminine appeal (chick flick stuff), but these do not. I highly recommend this series."
5,Anne,"The package arrived faster than I could have slipped on my trousers and gone downtown!I purchased this set for my Granddaughter's birthday. She is nearly 8, sweet, very feminine, and will LOVE Anne.I am very satisfied with this experience as I am with most purchases from Amazon.Whenever I have not been satisfied with a product, Amazon has always expeditiously refunded my money. You are the best!JohnRoseville, CA"
1,Disapointed,"Ordered this for my wife as a Christmas present She was excited to watch these with my daughters, but upon closer examination there were two copies of the second movie and no copies of the third."
1,Disappointed,"Orded the Trilogy set because I love the Anne of Green Gables movie. I ordered this for myself for Christmas. I am just now having time to watch the move. One dvid does not play on one-side. All the others work okay. The date to return the product is passed. The the amount of money spent for the set, it is very disaappointing to have one disc that did not work. I that could be replace, it would be nice."
4,good,Loved most of this dvd trilogy. If you have not read the Anne series you will love it all.. Could not help but think that the very last disc took too much liberty in getting away from the book. I was sorry that they did not follow the book closer on that disc. The rest was good and was close to the Anne Books. I am a great fan of Anne of Green Gables and all the Anne books that follow. I laugh and cry when I read them. I found that the dvd's made me laugh and cry as well. Lucy Maud Montgomery is such an exceptional author. Wish the last disc could have been different. That being said I would definitely reccomend this for anyone who loves a movie that is family oriented.
5,Fantastic,"Great story. If you like Downton Abbey you will like this. Orphen girl's life; adventure, mystery, love, faith, redemption, laughs. WWII period."
2,Anne of Green Gables Trilogy Box Set,I am hearing impraired mean deafness and can't have this without closed captioned or english subtitle. I would high recommend that is not for hearing impraired!
4,Wonderful,"I liked the trilogy very much. I have already seen all the parts many times on TV and I like them so much. I purchased the DVDs mainly as a collector item and because of the special features. I give only 4 stars out of 5 due to less special features on DVD 1 and 2 than I expected. The quality of the picture is not excellent, but still the same as on TV."
5,Anne Trilogy,"I bought this set for my granddaughter who is reading all of the ""Anne"" books. I watched the series on PBS and found them delightful. She is enjoying them after she reads the books. They are very well done."
3,The third isn't worth it,"Well the first two are classics. Amazing films, but the third is a disappointment. Why they had to ride off the success and make a crap film I don't know. The third movie isn't worth it. Just buy the first two separately and save five bucks."
1,Anne of Green Gables Trilogy Box Set,"I ordered this trilogy box set twice, because the third DVD in the set was titled correctly, but the recording was the first movie in the set. This was the case on the replacement as well. The third DVD is ""Anne of Green Gables, The Continuing Story."" What was recorded on the DVD was, ""Anne of Green Gables."" We enjoyed the movies, but requested a refund because of the stated problem."
2,Help!!!!!,"Anne of Green Gables Trilogy Box SetCan someone please help me? I bought the Anne of Green Gables Trilogy Box Set and even though it didn't have chapter selections and it was difficult to tell side A from B or 1 from 2, I managed that ok. One thing for me that I can't over come is that after watching Anne of Green Gables and The Sequel it jumps from her seeing Gil thru his illness getting ready to go to a bonfire with her School Headmaster and friend to being in London in a war!!!!!! What happened in-between????? I am so confused! Am I missing a DVD or another of the set??? I love the story and enjoyed the first two immensely, however, my grandbabies and I are absolutely confused. Please advise if anyone should know anything."
3,no scene selection,I think the movie is a good quality but it does not have scene selections and for so long a movie that is really a disadvantage.
5,Great!,The Anne of Green Gables set came as expected. It was just what I wanted. Will make a great gift.
5,A classic on DVD,"A great movie collection, the DVDs look great on our flat screen. One of the few movies that does it's books any justice. Great acting, great directing. The last movie is a little weird and doesn't seem like the same ""Anne of Green Gables"" Trilogy feeling to it."
4,Anne of Green Gables,"Very good story. Good actors. The last one turned out to be difficult to follow because the sides said they were one and two, but they were two and one. We watched the second part of #3, then saw the first part. The DVDs were labeled wrong. But I still enjoyed the whole thing. Good way to end it, just a lot of life ahead of them. Draw your own conclusions."
3,crappy dvd,"dvds arrived just as promised; however, on the second side of each dvd (3) the commentary played and could not be turned off. big disappointment, crappy quality control. i'm hesitant to purchase any more dvds this way."
2,Anne of Green Gables the trilogy,"I am very unhappy. I finally made it to the third disc and it was the recording wrong apparently. It is marked correctly, ""The Continuing Story"", but has the first movie on the disc. I was very disappointed. I would love to watch the last in the trilogy if you have it and would like to make this right."
2,Quality is NOT fantastic,"I had to return this product the first time because the first disc got stuck part way through. I can't tell you how annoying it is to be watching and 14 minutes into the second side of Part 1 just freezes. So I mailed it back, got another copy a few days later, and everything was fine up till Part 3. The disc is labelled wrong!! I put it in, was watching and getting confused, but figured, okay, so they jumped right into the action with this one. An hour later, credits rolled, and that's when I realized that that they they labelled Side One and Side Two backwards. I missed the whole first half of the third installment. At this point I was too irritated to go back and watch the first half. Can't recommend this product."
2,Anne of Green Gables,"I was really disapointed in the presentation of the DVD. It doesn't even have chapter selection on the DVD menu. The point of getting the DVD was to have those amenities that DVD's offer and I had to fastfoward slowly through the movie until I got to the scene where I had last left off. Since the only difference between the VHS version and the DVD is the Cd itself, i felt that it was extremely overpriced. However, it is a wonderful story and I very much enjoyed watching it again. :)"
2,Expected More,"I wanted to confirm some of the other reviews that I have read regarding this product. This is basically a copy to DVD of the VHS tapes. Theres really no quality improvment and there are no chapter breaks or divisions. So, other than taking up less space on the shelf and perhaps lasting a bit longer than the VHS, theres not a whole lot of difference from the VHS."
1,Anne Trilogy Box Set,"The CD's of Anne of Green Gables are of very poor quality. The film was not always clear and there were some skips and missing parts to the CD. I would return them but, I just did not have the time as they were a present for my granddaughter. I will be chalking this purchase up to a big mistake and buy the CD's at Best Buy. My very old VHS's are better."
5,There has never been another group like these guys.,"The spring I graduated from high school, my boyfriend and I saw these guys open for Elton John of all people. We couldn't believe our ears. They were the hippest, tightest, swinging-est band we'd ever heard. In fact, most of the audience didn't know what to make of them, but I found a lifelong favorite. Give this disk a listen."
3,Works.,"It works great, but has the cord. I like the cordless charger better for reasons explained in review for that charger."
5,A MUST READ for a totally different view of World War II,"This book is truly wonderful. I was moved to tears by the end and read it cover to cover without pause because it was so engaging. It tells a story of World War II that I had never heard and gives an interesting picture of the Eastern front. Countries and cities were pitched back and forth between Russia and Germany, and through this madness we learn of the amazing survival instincts of two brothers. This book will grip you within the first 10 pages, just before the war began, and you will not want to put it down until you know how it and the war ends for the characters."
4,Disposable pop for the ages!,"Having reached my thirties, it's a little daunting to realize that I've loved some of the music on this collection for more than half my life. This is a solid no-frills collection of a group that specialized in elegant, sometimes perfect pop music. Taking many of the right cues from David Bowie and Brian Ferry and combining it with a musical sense all their own, ABC's best songs have endured while many artists who scored hugher on the pop charts of the day have been forgotten. Some gems are obvious (""The Look of Love"", ""Be Near Me"" and ""When Smokey Sings"") while others such as ""S.O.S."" (which is not a cover of the ABBA song) may not be familiar on first listen. Nonetheless, all the songs here will be thoroughly enjoyed and taken to heart by all those who appreciate exquisite pop music."
3,Great band but this is a terrible compilation!,"""Best of ABC"" is at best a slapdash affair by Mercury to fob off a handful of tracks from their first four releases with two harder to find non-album tracks. ""Absolutely ABC"" covers the same ground more effectively and re-releases of other recordings have appended the non-album tracks so its not worth wasting your money on this unless you HAVE to have it. ""Best of ABC"" skews WAY heavily to ""Lexicon..."" their first release with only one to two tracks from each of the remaining three. While ABC is one of the best of the New Romantic bands of the 80s they are NOT well served by this release and potential buyers would be advised to start elsewhere. This release has all the earmarks of a record label seeking to cash in by merely tacking on a couple rarities."
4,A great 80's collection,So nice to hear their songs once again...a real good CD collection for the 80's lovers
1,Del vikings,I can not rate this cd yet because i have not received Come go with me yet by the Del vikings. I must say; I do love the song and I will rate the CD when I receive it. I'm sure it will be a five star rate.
1,keep failing one after the other...,"We have 24 of this light bulbs in our house. After 8 months, 6 of them failed. Some of them we didn't even use that often. It take a 2-3 mintues for it to warm up as well. I will not buy this again."
5,Excellent Introduction to Hardanger,"I taught myself hardanger using this book alone. My first project is nearly completed and looks very nice. The first part of the book teaches each of the different stitches required to complete the projects in the book. There are many illustrations that clearly show each step of a new stitch and make it easy to learn. Once all of the stitches are taught, she moves into the projects. They are arranged in increasing order of difficulty and start with a small sampler and end with a christening gown. I highly reccomend this book for anyone who is interested in exporing hardanger embroidery."
1,no poppy seed taste or flavor,"whole, unbroken kernels in some sort of sticky syrup, it just does not taste as poppy seed to me. Defenitely not good for rolls or as a filling, might be better if you mix it in dough. I will better spend more on a quality product. Also, way too sweet for me."
2,Poor overall design.,"People complained about the earbud being too big, but it is not meant to go straight into the ear, but rather to be sideways. This is supposedly less damaging to one's hearing. That said, it still doesn't fit well, and is rather uncomfortable. To make matters worse, the clip that comes with it tears the outter insulation on the wire apart. put the clip on and leave it. Taking it off will tear the wire, tring to slide it will tear the wire. This product gets an F- for engineering, but a B for sound quality, hence, 2 stars."
4,Works for Me,"This is a real bargain, and for me, it beats the battery draining bluetooth any day. The reception is good, but there is a little static before the connection is made on the other end. I haven't experienced any problem with the earbud falling out of my ear unless of course I pull on the cord. It doesn't just fall out on its own. The earbud doesn't have foam on it, but this doesn't make it uncomfortable to wear.I looked this set up on the Motorola website and it retails for $20. I wouldn't recommend it at that price because it's just a plain headset without any bells and whistles, but basically for the cost of shipping and handling, it's a great buy and I recommend it."
3,Watch out for shipping charges!!!,"Hubby asked me to buy him a few more of these, b/c there are times he does not want to use his Bluetooth. I thought the price was really right, less than a dollar, so got him several more. But these folks ('DLN Enterprises') are charging almost $30 for shipping!!! (And these earbuds are small and lightweight, so don't know what's up with that...) Otherwise, he likes these okay, tho' they are easy to damage (which is why I'm purchasing several more)."
1,Too big for my ear,It was too big for my ear and it was not very loud even after turning the volume up...take it off the market..please
1,"Earpiece is too large for ear, causing pain and/or falls out","This headset is useless. The ear piece is much too large for my ear. So, it either hurts the inside of my ear, or else falls out. I keep 1 anyway (b/c I live in NYC and it is illegal to drive w/out a headset), but I don't make calls in the car like I did. The proprietary connector to the phone limits my use of outside headsets (such as the ones I have, from my old phone). I am looking forward to a JABRA headset being made for the RAZR!"
1,This completely sucks,"The sound is horrible... people say I sound like I am in a muffled tunnel. And I bought two, to have in case the BT ran down.... poor me..... And my Plantronics 620 works like cr*p too. No noise cancellation worth a d*mn... forget about using it when driving a car.... I am trying to find a new one..."
3,Motorola Hands-Free Headset for RAZR V3,Works OK. Just plug it in and the phone automatically detects the headset. The earpeace doesn't easily stay in the ear.
5,ancient man,A buck and two pennies. Can anyone beat that price?It works fine. Shipping fast. Will buy again.
3,Meeker Review,"Great item. I never use it though. I have it for backups, incase my bluetooth fails me."
3,Not a very good mic....,"This headset provides good sound for you to hear the other side, but the mic on this headset catches a lot of ambient noise and people will have a hard time hearing you."
1,junk,"i figured for $5 and free shipping it couldnt be that bad, but it was. worthless, not even worth sending back... i cant tell whether it was broken or just really poor quality stuff."
2,Not the best,Sound Quality is on par with other wired head phones. For some reason though the headset kept making 3 way calls and the cord was too short.
1,Piece of garbage - microphone hardly works.,"I took a chance and bought this in spite of the bad reviews. What a mistake! The earphone works OK, but the microphone is so weak that one must yell directly into it to be barely heard. I cannot believe that this is a ""geniune Motorola"" item."
1,Useless by design?,"I had ordered this one as on Amazon it looked different from the headsets Motorola is distributing with the RAZR (at T-Mobile). But it turned out to be identical to this useless piece of plastic. If you do not have Motorola ""normed"" ears (they need to be huge!!) this will fall out of your ear even without moving. I usually like Motorola products, but they should be ashamed of such a poorly thought out design.Well I guess there is a marketing strategy behind it. As there are no useful headsets for Motorola phones that have a usb-plug, they will get thousands of people who will go out and buy Motorola's bluetooth headset instead.If I ever decide to join the crowd of people looking like dorks with their headset glued to their ears, I promise it will not be a Motorola (Motorola, this is a message to you, do you hear me????)"
1,Doesn't work at all!,"I purchased 2 of these, one for myself, another for someone else. Turns out one of them only sort of worked, person on the other end of the line always said it was too quiet even though the volume was turned to the max setting. The other didn't work at all, maybe something wrong with the connection. Either way, don't waste your time."
1,does not work.,"i bought one from amazon, super saver and all. the first one did not work. amazon sent me a second next day air and it did not work. the thing did not cost me much money so i gave up. instead i spent $400 on a jvc bluetooth ready cd player that makes my whole care a speaker phone. it is awesome."
1,"Poor, shoddy ear piece","Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone, the ear bud is too big, uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear. After two weeks of use, the on/off switch stopped working, and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit. In sum, it was a waste of money. There was no provision in this review for ""0"" stars, so I gave it ""1"""
1,The Worst headsets ever,"DO NOT BUY THIS, especially if you have long hair. Your hair gets all tangled up and it is painful, twice I lost a bunch of hair getting them off. I trashed them. The sound quality is awful and they are so big they hurt your ears. Not worse a penny."
4,Motorola wired microphone and ear buds,The product works as advertised. The ear buds are a little too big for some people. The sound is good and the clarity is better than comparable blue tooth equipment.
5,Great Buy!,"Bought for my Mom, had never used headset. Loves it and I feel better with her on phone with headset. Thanks"
2,hands free phone accessory,"Motorola Hands-Free Headset for RAZR V3This product is good for what it is. It's very inexpensive, but does the job well. I give it two stars, because it does have the ""blow-by"" sound when you breathe into it, or if the wind blows over it. It works great indoors though."
4,"Works as expected, nothing special.","Headset works well as expected, nothing special. Purchased from The OEM Shop for just $3! Can't complain for that price. Nice to have a wired headset in the car when your bluetooth runs out of battery."
1,Dead Unit,"Never worked out of box so i am not sure its seller mistake or ear buds `ve durability issues ,just don`t buy them from ""accessory one"" try some other seller may be You`ll have better luck.so one star may be unfair for the product itself......"
2,Does not fit well.. you get for wat u pay,This headset is usable but does not stay on ur ears. you wud perhaps need a sponge cover for the earphone.
3,an okay item,This is an okay item as far as its price concerned.The earpiece is larger than normal size and customers might have a hard time tugging it into the ear.
2,Wish I'd come to Amazon first,"I bought my first one at a car wash for $20+ with tax. It didn't work. You could not hear anything from the earpiece and the person you call could not hear you clearly or easily. They complained of scratching and crackling sound and very low volume. I returned it to the car wash for a replacement and this second headset seems to be working okay. We'll see for how long... Like I said, I would have been much less upset if I had only paid $0.01 for it, because from the look of the other reviews that's about how much it's worth."
3,close...but no cigar!,"This fit my Verizon V3M Razr, fit on my person comfortably while driving and would be a great gadget if it were not for the HUGE ear bud. I have large earcanals and this earbud does not even come close to fitting in it. Rediculous!Most reputable earbud companies (V-Moda, Bose and Shure) have different size earbuds for each individual. I am disappointed in this product..."
4,Works perfect,The hands free headset is a good buy for the price. However the earbud is not real comfortable in the ear. But it works and I don't have to worry about charging it like the bluetooth.
4,Great wired headset,"I bought this because I couldn't hear or be heard on my bluetooth for my phone, and I like the idea of the wire better. The sound is great, and car noise is greatly reduced. The one thing I don't like is that the button on the headset tends to pull up my ""recent calls"" list, rather than hang up on the call. Other than that, it's a good headset."
2,The device has a connection problem.,"The device seems not to match well my mot razr v3 cell phone. It has a connection problem, and hardly works."
1,Defective product,"I ordered two sets. Did not work at all( you can't hear the caller but the caller can hear you). In sum, it was a waste of money. I will not buy again."
1,Terribly unconfortable,"Bought this beacuse is the OEM earbud and I supposed it was good. This device has 2 problems:1. The cable is too short so if you want to speak in the car, is very difficult to put the phone at rest at some place.2. The earpiece is terrible, gigantic. I am not a small person and the earpiece barely fits in place, it falls all the time.Terrible product."
2,Not for the RAZR V3m (Verizon),"Despite the advertising headline (both here and in many other places) this headset does NOT work with the V3m version of the Motorola RAZR. It appears reasonably well built, but that hardly matters if it doesn't serve its intended purpose!"
3,"Agree with some negative reviews, but see good points","I agree with other commentors that the audio quality is not great but it is cheap and it does serve its purpose. My main problem with this earwire was that it was not at all designed with a human ear in mind. Motorola is apparently coming up with more of a ""earbud"" style headset. I dont know, these are ok for now."
1,terrible,I agree with all the other reviewers. It is TOOOOO big for your ear. I don't know why it is made so large.
4,Motorola Hands-free Corded Headset for RAZR V3,"Well I wasn't sure about this headset reading all the negative reviews. Honestly I don't see what the problems are... this headset works great! The one problem I encountered is with the cord clip. The cord clip wasn't attached to the cord instead just clipped around it. I tried clipping it on but can't. No worries, the mic is positioned in such a way that you don't really need the clip anyways. Only other issue is that you can't charge the phone while using the corded headset."
1,Made for a Giant,"This headset was apparently made for a giant, as I can only imagine that a giant would be able to fit this thing in his/her ear. I am an average size woman, with what I belive to be average size ears and I could not even come close to getting this thing in my ear.Make sure you have big ears before ordering!"
1,Useless with an L2,"I bought 2 thinking that it was a cheaper alternative for my home mobile phones and a more secure alternative to the Bluetooth headset for my work phone. I've had hearing tests that were louder than this headset.The L2 isn't listed here, but it is in other places. If that's your model phone, don't buy this headset."
2,Buying sight unseen has its downsides,The ear piece is way too large to fit in your ear and so falls out easily when used.
1,Too large for anyone,"I am a six foot tall man, and this headset won't fit in my ear. Apparently Motrola wants to ""up-sell"" their RAZR customers to blue tooth."
3,Headset,I was not able to us it It would not fit my phone but I do hope to get one that will G. Wilson
3,Hand free headset,The ear piece is too big to fit in my ears...but the quality is very clear...if only I can keep it in place.
3,you get what you pay for.,"The price on this was nominal, a few cents, and so for those of you who live in a state that now requires you to have one of these if driving, it's fine. It isn't even horrible, but it isn't good. I gave it three stars because it's actually better than the razr handset is on it's own, in many occasions. But don't think it's going to fit comfortiably in your ear, or that your problems will be solved.-dsa"
4,Simply good,"My bluetooth ear piece gave me a headache after awhile. This alternative doesn't. It has good sound quality. Only downside, I lost the clip that attaches to your shirt within the 1st week."
1,"Dirt Cheap, Medium Quality, Poor Design","This headset is obviously the cheapest one you can buy, but as always you get what you pay for.The Pros: good call quality as expected from a wired headsetThe Cons: The earpiece doesn't have an ear-strap or any foam and isn't shaped at all to fit in you ear and thus, doesn't. Unless you physically tape it to your face it isn't staying anywhere.My advice: Even at 5 cents this isn't worth it, spend the money to get something that works and don't waste our time on this junk."
1,Unbalanced bud makes it fall out (and beware the pic!),"I bought this headset because I thought it was like headsets I'd used with all my previous phones, where the plastic arm comes straight off of the bud (like standard iPod earbuds, for example) -- that's how it looks in the picture. Turned out to be the same headset I'd previously bought and returned in stores (albeit cheaper); the earbud is a sort of megaphone shape, so where the downward pull of the cord keeps a regular earbud in place, on this headset, it just pulls it out of your ear. The angle of the pic in this particular listing makes it look like a regular earbud -- see this pic of another headset for a side shot: http://www.amazon.com/Hands-Free-Headset-Motorola-SYN0896-Eforcity/dp/B000VKAJJ6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=wireless&qid=1213019078&sr=8-4)."
2,Keeps Falling Out,"After going thru several bluetooths, I decided to get a regular headset again because reception just always seemed better.I was thrilled to find the exact same headset that originally came with my Razr for such a great price.The only problem I have is that it just won't stay put. It constantly falls out of my ear. So now I am looking for a silicone cover that will help it stay in place."
3,Good thing no cheap,The headset works but it won't stay in my ear. You need a sponge cap to keep the headset stays in your ear. Well good thing won't cheap......
3,Just an 'ok' headset...,"This isn't a real great headset. It works, just nothing special.The earpiece doesn't fit too well, and it doesn't have multiple sizes.Having said all that, what exactly to you expect for this price? I'd buy it again, just realize that it's functional, nothing fancy."
1,NOT FOR THE MOTOROLA Q,"Listed as an accessory under Motorola Q, it is not compatible. I'm sure it works great for the RAZR....."
5,songs,I love this CD. I had one in the past and it cracked. I was so happy to order one from Amazon. This made my day. Good music and good Christmas artists and songs.
1,Disgusting!!,"Shame on You Lorrie Morgan!! You butchered a classic when you took upon ""O Holy Night!!"" You were off key, off tempo, and backed off the high note at the end. I took this CD and literally threw it away...I did save the jewel boxhowever."
1,Could have been...,"I don't understand how an obviously talented man could craft a book that is, by his own account, somewhat of a catharsis for him, yet is so completely mundane and poorly written that it seems to literally be written by an untalented teenager.The story could have been great. Maybe it is a great story if you have the experience of depression and suicidal tendancies. Maybe it expresses those experience and feelings exactly. I don't have that experience, and really, reading this book did nothing to help me understand those feelings, nor did it connect me emotionally to the experiences of people who suffer from these types of disorders.Runyon lived that which he was writing about. If only he would have somehow harnessed the power of those memories of that period of his life. It would have been great.Instead, we're left with this. A book about some kid with a bad attitude who doesn't give us any reason to care."
2,Needs some work.,"The Burn Journals, in my opinion, could have been written better. I mean, no one really needs to hear about someone having an erection. We want to know how he overcame his state of being and regained his dignity. That's why I gave this book a two. It was ok, but it needed more work."
5,So Much More Than I Expected,"This book is so much more than an account of a 14 year old's attempted suicide. It is, at the same time, wickedly funny and poignantly insightful. It's about families and friends (and random celebrities), about the heady effects of testosterone and the hard edges of being cool. It is also about unspeakable pain and uncompromising love. Beautiful, simple language. Dialogue that will ring true to the ears of teens and parents. Insights only a 14 year old could have combined with perspective only an adult could give. Impossible not to laugh and cry."
2,You have got to be kidding me.,"I couldn't wait until this book was over. I almost didn't finish and absoluteley skimmed over the last 60 pages when nothing had anything to do with any kind of growth or journey. If you want to read or want your kids to read an account about a guy who tried to kill himself, scared himself for life, continued to judge other people and feel sorry for himself, this is the book for you. Oh yes did I mention every 10 pages he talks about getting into a girls pants or blouse or trying out his ""junk"" to make sure it works. I wanted a book about a kid who survives a major ordeal and grows to appreciate life a little more. What was more important to the author was talking about his developing sexuality. Boring. Who cares about whether this guy want to touch a girls boobs? Spend your time reading something more important."
5,love the book,good shape loved reading this book it is sad and also very heart warming if i could i would have paid more for it.
5,The Burn Journals.,"The Burn Journals by Brent Runyon is about a fourteen year old boy who's having a rough life and one day he decides he doesn't want to be alive anymore, so he covers himself in gasoline and lights himself on fire. His brother saved Brent's life. The rest of the book is about Brent's long and painful recovery.I thought this book was very good because it touches on what the real life of a teenager is like. A lot of times teenagers have emotions they don't know how to deal with. This book shows people what the signs of depression are so it could help people help themselves or friends that are going through it.The book relates to the book To Kill a Mocking Bird. Tom Robinson committed suicide and gave up all hope just like Brent did in the beginning of the book, and then he got his hope back and moved on."
4,Teaching and learning tool...,I recommend it as a good read for adolescents and adults and as a great teaching tool for middle school and older students. I plan to read excerpts to my students this year.
3,"emotionally gripping, does not grasp readers interest","I bought this book because I thought it sounded very compelling. Brent had a great story about overcoming obstacles, but I feel it could have been written better. Some parts of the book were quite graphic, as others were very boring. Overall, I think it was ok. Not the greatest thing I've ever read, but definitely not the worst."
2,Review courtesy of www.teensreads.blogspot.com,"The reason that I picked up this book was that I had seen somebody perform part of it as an acting event. The thing was, he had only used the first section, which was so short, and the rest of the book was BORING!The writing doesn't get much credit at all. It's choppy, which was done on purpose, but I don't think that Brent reached what he had hoped to with this. Instead, he upped the page length and made his book much more choppy and annoying to read. At one point, there were single sentences on each page. It's because his thoughts were so choppy at that point, but it makes reading it very annoying."
3,Chillingly Cynical,"I currently work with children who struggle with behavioral and emotional issues and was interested in this book for its supposed insight into depression and teens. I enjoyed the brute honesty and humor in the book. However, I was surprised at the amount of critical comments aimed at other characters in the book when I expected more insight and self-reflection from Brent himself. Interesting read, but not helpful."
2,Amputated rather than edited...,"Burke's most important work ""Reflections on the Revolution in France"" is reduced from nearly 200 pages to 60 pages in this volume. Yet nowhere in the book does the editor describe what he selected or what he dropped, or the basis for his decisions.Comparing my copy of ""Reflections.."" to this chopped version I found that Kramnick had dropped passages that were highly insightful.When I discovered this, I could no longer be confident that the other works were not similarly mangled. I will now search for an anthology of works that is more respectful of the originals (or at least one where the editor is more open about his approach)."
4,Very Able,"Unamuno is not the paradigm of philosophical fiction...but he's damn good. The three stories contained have the wealth of information usually associated with Borges. OK, OK, maybe not that prodigious, but excellent, nonetheless. Included in this volume is San Manuel Bueno, Matyr which evokes...well, there is alot of magic to the story, which is hard to transmit. Unamuno is sort of...the Spanish Hawthorne."
5,An Inspiration to Creativity,"The affirmations on these beautiful cards are both inspiring and practical. As a professional writer who lives by her creative wits, I am always looking for ways to motivate myself. The affirmations on these cards center on the creative process. Whether you are creating a life or a award-winning book, they will help keep you focused and flowing."
5,This is the Best,"I've used this lip balm for years. As a flutist, I need to keep my lips in good condition, and Camille Beckman is the best I've found. I love the combination of ingredients, and especially that sweet almond oil is the first ingredient. It has just the right texture, stays put for a while, and is non-irritating. It adds no color, and little gloss. Now my husband uses it, and asks for more when he runs out."
3,"Good idea, but hard for a kid to use.","The alarm clock works well and my daughters like the Cinderella voice clip option for the alarm. It is also equipped with a neat star ceiling projection. However, it is not very loud and it is not easy for anyone under 5 to work. The buttons are small and it's hard for kids to figure out what all of the buttons mean- especially when they first wake up in the morning. My kids end up pushing multiple buttons and I have to come cut everything off- which kind of defeats the purpose of having an alarm clock to help them wake up. For the price I wish it had come equipped with a CD player as well. It would probably work fine for an older child."
1,JUNK,"This clock looks great for princesses, but does not work great. The pre-programmed princess song plays 1 lame partial song for a short period of time. The star night light burned out on 1 of the 2 we have within 1 year, and is not fixable. And we can only get 1 radio station to tune in, even with the thin wire antenna adjusted.It does keep time and the alarm clock wake with buzzer does work.Save your money and buy some cute other princess bedroom accessories, and skip this one!"
1,Waste of Money,"You'd think that a clock could keep time but this one can't, and I'm always having to readjust the time. The recorded sounds are barely intelligible and get rather annoying very quickly. The radio is hard to tune and it gets terrible FM reception. Basically it looks cute on the nightstand, but its a waste of money as a clock."
2,Also dissappointed...,"We received this as a gift, and our daughter loved it. However, similiar to other reviewers, we soon started having trouble with our star light. It flickers and is just a distraction to my daughter when she is in bed, so we can not use her favorite feature anymore. She asks us to fix it all of the time, but there is no way we have found to change out the bulb and I am not sure that would actually even solve our flickering. It is a shame that the manufacturer did not anticipate that the bulb would need to be changed out. Low quality and a poor product design."
1,Horrible. Period.,Cheap material. No AM reception whatsoever. Knobs very hard to turn. Ugly colors. The only cool thing is the projection of stars on the ceiling. I returned it to the store for a refund.
2,A Big Let Down,"My daughter loves this clock, especially because the singing and the nightlight that projects stars onto the ceiling (which is an unusable feature now). As a parent, I feel differently. The material is cheap, the music is low quality making it hard to understand the words, and we have yet to find a fm or am station it will pick up. There is not an auto off for the projection light and ours died out after 4 months. I could not find a way to get to the light bulb to change it, so my husband worked on it. He had to take out all the electronics in order to reach the light, which is fiber optic encased in a housing unit that does not come apart, so the light is unchangeable. I am very disappointed as the music and lights were the main selling point of this unit."
4,Cute little alarm clock,"Just bought this at Target and it is a really cute little alarm clock. The stars on the ceiling are really cute- I just wish it had an auto off button for the stars because I can see the bulb burning out pretty quick if it is left on all night. You can wake up by radio, buzzer or a princess song and voice. I have no problem getting the AM/FM to work. It is a little annoying that it is a turn dial for the radio stations and not digital. I can't tell what station I have it on. My daughter is only 6 so she doesn't need to wake up to the radio anyway. I think it is really cute. It is smaller than it looks in the picture which is a good thing."
2,poor quality,"We purchased this alarm clock for my 6 year old daughter less than a year ago. She loved the princess castle shape and the projected star feature. Within a couple months, the FM radio no longer works. She now has the option of waking up to AM talk radio or the obnoxious pre-recorded disney song. I find the dials and switches for changing stations and turning on and off to be very difficult to use. For the almost $30 we spent, I would definitly have chosen something else."
3,Not for the faint-hearted,"This book is more of a text book on Ezekiel than a commentary. You won't be able to understand it unless you are following along with your Bible.I prefer something that is easier to read, but will use this to fill in the gaps as I prepare my lessons to teach."
2,Interferes with USB cable for accessories,"FYI...tried this aluminum case on two different iPODs and it interfered with the cord contact on the USB accessory cable for a 4GB 1st generation Nano and for an 8GB 2nd gen Nano. The plug goes in but not fully, and the slight gap (due to the hard case) was enough to prevent an FM adapter from working. Took the Nano out of this aluminum case, used a soft sleeve and it worked perfectly. THEIR description says you don't need to remove it to access the port, but 2 users couldn't make it work. It's attractive, thought it would give superior protection, but all you can reliably use with it is the earbud cord. Stick with the sleeves."
2,Questionable title,"Aren't the words ""Medieval Islam"" a redundancy? When has Islam ever NOT been ""Medieval""? For example, if you want to study the history of the ""Dark Ages"", you could study 8th and 9th century Europe, OR you could look at any Arab country today that's guided by Islamic ideas."
5,Pointer Sisters in the Beginning,I remember purchasing the vinyl record years ago and loved it then and I still love it. Yes We Can Cann and Fairytale are just towof the stand out songs on this CD.
5,So much fun. . .,"I like this even better than Philadelphia Chickens-- there are fewer songs on this CD that I skip. (Only 1, 'Bad Babies,"" and mostly because I don't want my 3 year olds to say ""bad Babies"" in public. . . .)The ""Dinosaur Round"" could drive one nuts (if played as frequently as my kids would like it) if one didn't like to stomp around like an idiot (or a dinosaur). Personally, I love it. My husband, on the other hand, is about ""dinosaured"" out."
2,Hire a band. Synths are cheap and sound that way.,"My kids love the songs, the lyrics are cute, the vocalist is fine. The music is computerized shlock. If you like the sound of Barney, then you will love the backing music. The lyrics and singer deserve better. This is a basic issue I have with most of Boyton's CDs. More recent productions have included better lead artists, but the synthetic music still lurks in the background. On Rino tap, the ""horns"" sound like a early 90's synth patch. It is fine for the kiddos, but my god, after the 20th listen kill me. Hire session players, and you have a 5 star kids album. I expect more."
2,Too Many Codes Which Do Not Work!,"The first one-third of this book contains information which a beginner like me may quickly but too hastily find very grateful. But the feeling of being grateful will soon give way to a feeling of disappointment and anger as inaccurate code begin to show up one after another, which will make you waste countless hours. If you buy this book and have to go through the same horrible time of frustration as I have, you will agree that the authors have not tested the codes, which may sound quite incredible to you. I do not understand how this book has gotten that many positive feedbacks. I sent e-mails to the publishers to inquire about the codes in the book which did not function. But I haven't heard yet."
1,Riddled with errors and inconsistencies.,"I am so disapointed in this text. Not only does the content/code on the CD NOT match the text in the book, some of it is just plain wrong. An errata is available on the book's Web site to some minor credit of the author but with errors in a book for beginners is completely unprofessional. Don't waste your money on this text. Sadly, this book is rated highly by others. I wonder if they got though the code.Update: The latest version of this book, geared for PHP5 users is a huge improvement over this text."
2,Confusing Book!,"This book has too many codes that do not function. If you do not want to waste time trying to figure out the wrong codes, do not buy this horrible book. In all appearances, the authors did not test the codes even once."
2,Typos...typos...typos!,"Its a really good book to get you started, BUT, if you haven't coded with a similar language (such as asp), you might be in for a surprise! The code you download from the website, and the code in examples in the book have multiple typos. I spent a few hours just finding some spaces in the code downloaded from their site--spaces that caused the contacts database to not run. Sure would be nice if they tested the code first. Given that, I would not consider this the ""fast&easy"" development."
2,Page 8,"I couldn't get past page 8 in this book. The mysqld-opt command to use to start the mysql server is not what www.mysql.com recommends for a windows machine. The book looks like it's easy to read. But I couldnt get out of the starting block with the mysql effort in the first chapter. It was easier to buy a mysql book and do it the correct way. Some URL's are needed in the install area that take one to some type of Mysql installation help. There are some at the back of the book, but I only saw those as I was dropping the book in the trash.It's probably not the books fault, but mysql installations on a windows machine... well you have to be lucky. There is no forum easily accessbile at mysql.com and google points mostly to linux resources..."
4,Fast & Easy,"Titled appropriately, I found this book to be Fast & Easy. I was able to quickly learn concepts in PHP which I had been struggling to understand. The information is well-laid out and presented in a easily-understood format."
5,Love it,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it... Nice and sturdy which I like so it won't brake easily :)
3,Invest in something more sturdy!,"Originally ordered two 9"" chains. But the chains were too small. Had to return them for 10"" ones. Spent an extra $2.80 and $3.99 for shipping. UPDATE: 10/15/12 One of the chains broke from regular wear..I would purchase a sturdier one the next time.."
4,Glitter-lucious!,"this anklet is glitter-licious! recently, i lost weight & none of my toe rings fit anymore. this anklet is magnificent! i will have to get another!"
4,Makes a good door stop.,"Although this book is chocked full of good info, and written clearly, it is supersceded by the the Haynes TECHBOOK series called Automotive Computer Codes & Electronic Engine Management Systems, which contains all of the information that this Emmissions Manual has, plus even more on ignition and fuel injection systems. I purchased both of these books thinking that they covered entirely different automotive systems. Shows my ignorance. So don't be fooled by the different names. They are basically the same book, but this one's out-dated.I gave it four stars because it is basically still a good book. If it's the only thing you can get your hands on then by all means do it. The older systems and theories described in this book are still relavent and will further assist you in becoming a talented grease monkey."
3,Haynes auto emissions control manual,"Although the manual was not as current as I would have liked (That may have been my fault for not reading the description well enough) It arrived within a few days, and I was very pleased with my purchase."
1,the flag sent was not the one in the picture,Just a heads up. They sent me a different flag. I am sure they would have swapped it but I was putting on a fundraiser and time was officially non-existant.
2,Outdated,This book came in on time and in fine condition. I bought this as a class requirement & I just couldn't make myself read it. It is entirely the author's opinion & absolutely outdated. I don't recommend at all.
5,An absolutely beautiful book,"My family refers to this book ALL THE TIME, and I have used it to help countless others clarify their emotional issues. A beautifully thought-out, humanistic work. Highly recommended."
5,Best self healing book ever...,"Louise L. Hay's ""You Can Heal Your Life"" book is inspiring, healing, and one of the most beneficial books I have ever read from the self healing genre of books. It has helped my family stay healthier than using many of the remedies found on drug store shelves and my children are now in their twenties. As soon as I found out Laura Bush had cancer I immediately sent her my family copy, and purchased another copy for my bookshelf. Thanks Louise for your genuine understanding of the human condition. Brando Quin, author of ""The Master Painter"""
5,Awesome!!!,I love Louise Hay and her work! You Can Heal Your Life is one of the best self help books available on the market. I would recommend this to anyone who has grown tired of the rat race...
1,Welcome to the land of the deluded,"Beofre wasting your money on purchasing these books, read the first page. Her Amway style, evangelical christian morals come through in her presentation. If you are not able to automatically forgice the past and forget the past, save your money. The whole premise of the course is based on these two principles. The sad fact for most people looking to gain from these books, is that if they could actually do those two things in the first place they would not need the books at all.The work books are condescending and pointless. Perhaps consider ""The Positive Power of Negative Thinking by Julie Norem"" as a viable alternative to the unrealistic sunshine and light approach of Hay, who really needs a good dose of reality."
3,book condition,"My only objection is that the first chapter was full of yellow highlights, very annoying and I would have appreciated that being disclosed before I bought it. However, there were no highlights after the very beginning, so it was acceptable, but I would have chosen another copy if I'd known. I expect a used book to be somewhat worn, and I don't care about that, but I the text should be unaltered and free of notes or other markings from the previous owner."
1,The wrong book to look at,"Buy How To Find Yourself and Your Best Match Socionics by Rod Novichkov.This book, you wasted your money on, tells you that all your physical flaws are do to a disorder you may have in the way you think. How sad! Don't you want something positive that actually acknowledges you for who you are instead of pointing out everything about you you should be fixing?No amount of this book's receips will cure you of your acne (medicine and a good diet can).Isn't the whole purpose of this book to fix who you are so you can be happy for yourself and for those around you? Well you'll be too busy fixing rather then just being happy. Rod Novichkov's books shows you who you are and how to find happiness, truly, at last, a book that has come to humanity's aid."
1,"If I Could Give Zero Stars, I Would","This is such drivel.The idea that we create everything in our lives is simple-mindedness at best. At worst, it can lead people who don't know any better to abandon medical treatment and blame themselves unnecessarily for things truly out of their hands.What little good I gleaned I learned a long time ago.Also, it's outdated in at least one area. I didn't finish the whole thing; it may be outdated in other areas, too.I'm so sorry I wasted money on this. I ordered it from a book club. I wish I had had a chance to view it first.Don't waste your money. There are much better self-help books out there, ones that are sound and helpful."
3,Boring! Can't keep at it,"I am desparately trying to read this book as I do need ""healing"" very much . However I am not connecting with the author's premise. Perhaps when I complete reading I will begin to see a pattern and will be able to apply the concepts to my situation."
1,How can I rate something I have not recieved,Need to get the product before I can rate it. It has been over 1 1/2 months since ordering the product
2,"Say ""I love you!"" to yourself every day and....","you'll start believing it some day. This causes a reaction on the outside, because you will start to show selfconfidence and love etc. That's the message of this book, well maybe more of the sequal Life!, because this one (You can heal your life) is more based on your physical features. What I mean is that your body gives signs when you don't care enough about yourself, for example if you have breathing problems: you are afraid of sucking up life in to you etc. Let's sum it all up to this; Just say you are not afraid etc. to yourself frequently and pay attention to your physical health and you'll be fine, so don't buy the book, but go to the library."
2,not very helpful,I love these types of books but this one just didn't give a lot of really good/actionable information. Not worth the read.
4,awesome,This is an awesome book. I bought it for my Kindle and then wanted a hard copy to share. I've already loaned it out. It was in mint condition. Love it!
5,bad experience with seller,I really like this book and I really want this book but the seller has not sent it yet I've waited over a month. But I really find this book to be helpful and really connects with me and my experiences and want to have a book of my own.
5,The best life book ever,"When I first read this book it made me feel so much better. I could not believe that I was being so hard on myself. Everyday we experience life and people around us, but we are the hardest on ourselves. I realised this after reading the book. It is my senctuarity when I need it. It calmes me down and gets me back on track. It showes me that I can be who I am, that I don't owe anything to anyone but be true to myself and trust myself. Most of all to be kind and nice to myself.I love the book and I would recommend it to everyone. I think every person can find something useful for themselves in it. I just love it."
5,You can heal your life,In these troubled times it's so easy to just fall back and give up. This book has helped me tremendously no to do that. It's given me a lot of positive thoughts and ideas which are helping me a great deal.
5,Excellent Book!,"Louise Hay has a sweet and deep way to make us think about emotional thoughts that could affect our lives.If we can release them, we will find a shortcut for our happiness."
5,An old favourite,"I have had, 'You Can heal Your Life' on my bookshelf for years and refer to it regularly. Louise Hay is one of the first writers to explore the emotional creation of disease. As a cancer survivor i found this book essential reading and very supportive.David Elliot, author of,You Don't have To Die When Your Doctor Says: A practical guide to living with grace and joy in the face of a terminal prognosis."
4,Very thought provoking,"After reading the Secret I was recommended to read this book and I am really enjoying it. You have to be in the right state of mind to accept and absorb the writings, but it has come at a very good time in my life and I embrace it."
5,A great book of self-esteem,This book was helpful in my life. She teaches simple ways to learn to feel affection for ourselves. A great book of self-esteem.
2,"Good, but not amazing","This book has some good thoughts in it. Thinking positive, meditation, taking care of yourself. Having positive energy surrounding you is something good.However, I whole heartedly disagree with parts of this book. A lot of it comes across as victim blaming.Oh, you got cancer? It's because you're a negative person.You were born into an abusive family? It's your own fault because you CHOSE your parents.You're starving in Africa, or had your whole family murdered due to war? Oh that's because you needed that life experience.It disgusts me that she blames the person for their ailments in such a condescending, ignorant manner.Yes, it's good to be a positive person, because it leads to less stress, which helps health.But that should be obvious."
5,Classic self-help book,"This book is a classic in the self-help field. It teaches people how to actually apply ""the secret."" In clear language, it explains how we develop negative beliefs in childhood, and the steps to changing those beliefs. I found the book over 20 years ago and have used it ever since. It's a book that you can pick up over and over again when you need inspiration for dealing with challenges in your life. I had the privilege of studying with Louise Hay personally and now lead Heal Your Life trainings based on her philosophy. I was also inspired to write my own book using the playful image of a Cosmic Chef fulfilling your orders.Ordering from the Cosmic Kitchen: The Essential Guide to Powerful, Nourishing Affirmations"
4,"At first I was hesitant about this book, but after a few chapters... I was captivated","This book was recommended to me after my family suffered a tragedy. At first I was hesitant about it. A non-beleiver, you can say. But Louise Hay broke her message down into easy-to-understand chapters. After reading a few chapters I was convinced that she was right on target.I learned alot while reading this book. I've applied the techniques from the book to my everyday life, and have had successful results. I'm glad that I was given this book. Unfortunately, I had to give it back, which is why I'm here..... ordering another one.(Worth the $15 though.)"
1,Misrepresented,"The contents of this book are great - the book though is mentioned to have beautiful colours throughout and be worhty of a ""gift"". This is not the case. This is not the original brightly coloured version, but the black and white version. this needs to be made much more clear - I was very disapointed to be sent these and not the beatiful gifts I had planned to give."
1,Profiting from False Healing,"This book is actually promoting occult practices. Louise L. Hays website is full of occult books and ideas. Louise actively promotes New Age Atheism. Such as The Worship of False gods and goddesses, Astrology, Channeling and Tarot cards.Although true in a few areas. One can worry too much and get an ulcer. Many ulcers are due to bacterial infections. Many cancers and diseases are caused by Genetic Defects at Birth, such as Hemophilia and Muscular Dystrophy. Some Illnesses are caused by the way we choose to live our lives, such as smoking causing Lung Cancer.This book denies the existence of the Christian GOD and promotes the god or goddess within. This is nothing more than wishful thinking.Many people such as gay folks who are dying of AIDS who are desperate for a cure are buying this book with the false hope they can simply ""wish"" away thier disease."
3,you can heal your life,"Louise, you are great but its time to move over and let newer people with fresher ideas in"
1,unhappy with the condition of the book!,I wish it was disclosed that the pages of this book I purchased had earmarks and some pages were also waterlogged. I wouldn't have bought it. I could have just spent a couple of more dollars and bought the book new.
4,Very spiritual and easy to relate to,"I find the chapters from the middle forward to be more interesting and practical than the beginning. A lot of the philosophies that the author advocates in the book, in my opinion, is very very constructive and TRUE. For example, when you change from the inside (look at yourself differently), everything else on the exterior or around you in the real world would follow the change. It seems easy to understand, but it is actually quite something that most people have trouble doing, if they do think about it.My reason for giving it a 4-star rating is that I found the beginnning of the book to be a bit dull."
1,Toxic,"As a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, I cannot assert enough how wrong this book is. It is at best naive, and at worst toxic- I can see how those who are likely to pick up this book, looking for answers, feeling vulnerable, will attempt this simplistic way of solving their dilemmas, only to fail, and blame themselves. It therefore propagates the emotion that is in the heart of most disorders- shame, what this book ostensibly sets out to correct. If I had to save one book if my office is on fire, and the one that has most elicited that ""aha!"" moment in my patients, it is ""the mindful way through Depression"", by Teasedale et al. Check this one out!"
2,Reckless and Irresponsible,"Because Ms. Hay presents some basic ideas (ala ""The Secret"") that are valid involving the effect negative thinking has on every aspect of your health and well-being, I won't give this one star. A massage therapist recommended this book to me because I have MS and I read the entire thing with an open mind, though I became concerned fairly early on. I am surprised there aren't more reviewers who find Ms. Hay's edicts as to how this or that thought pattern cause SERIOUs physiological problems and diseases--with no scientific back-up, training, and very little anecdotal evidence--really irresponsible. To suggest that you can cure yourself of life-threatening conditions by repeating her suggested affirmations is reckless. Beyond that, the intense focus on self and glorification of the material (bordering on greed) strike me as counter to creating what is genuinely positive."
1,I Had Spinal Meningitis Before I Was Even 1,"And according to her, the cause of spinal meningitis is anger. What could I have been angry about at that age???I guess her book appeals to people with no real problems or brains because it makes them FEEL like they can solve all by just thinking and feeling particular ways.Fraud."
2,"great book, lousy kindle edition","bought the kindle after reading this wonderful book. very disappointed in the kindle version: bad layout and punctuation, actually interfering with reading. needs a real editor."
5,Life-saving,"Becoming acquainted with this book at this time in my life has become a true lifesaver for me. It has truly taught me to reflect on the way I think and how it has affected my health and general well-being. For the first time in many years, I've found that changing my way of thinking has brought me peace of mind, as well as release from a lot of the pain I have experienced. I now believe so much of my deteriorating health is attributed to the way I was thinking. Louise Hays has truly opened my eyes, and I am so very grateful."
1,I feel stupid for buying this book,I have not yet read the whole book and I already cant stand it. As I read it all I can think is Wow this author is very conceited. The way she talks about herself is soooooo narcissistic. I have seen pictures of her and I think its weird that she looks like she has had so much plastic surgery done. How is this someone that is at peace with themselves? I dont get it. I wish I could get my money back.
4,Think about the mental cause of a sickness in seeking a cure,"This is a very helpfull book. Look at your ailments to see how to deal with them in both mental and physical space.I do not see this as a book that deals only with mental healing but rather it presents an approach for the whole person. It is an excellent book, heavy on the emotional side but a bit light on the technical side. But then this is not really a problem as most other books on health are exclusivly physical so a balance can readily be found for the discerning reader."
5,You can Heal your Life,This was sent to a friend as a gift and arrived in a timely manner.The book and DVD were well received and liked!Well done!
4,I liked this,This was pretty good. I liked The Power of Spoken Words much better. Louise Hay has very good Cd's and I enjoy listening to her. If you are a person whol likes self improvement Cd's check out her collection. I do recommend her Cd's
5,Louises books keep centered as I age.,Louises books keep me centered many of my friend have died.. Sometimes I wonder why I am still here..Her books are very encourageing..
4,like the positive,Louise gets to the heart of healing. It has to come from within. Great reminder to believe in yourself and others to have the best life possible.
5,Great Book!,This is a wonderful encyclopedia of affirmations for healthy visualizations for anyone and everyone who is interested in feeling better and thinking more positively about their life!
5,Powerful Message!,"This book has been a New York Times Bestseller for a reason: It's message is powerful!Louise Hay writes, ""If we are willing to do the mental work, almost anything can be healed.""We learn in this book how our thoughts and beliefs can often be the cause of many illnesses. Ms. Hay herself is a survivor of cancer and she has used the healing approach highlighted in this book to overcome her own illness.The Wounded Healer is someone who becomes a healer through her own personal suffering and this is the case with Ms. Hay who shares her insights into healing through this wonderful book. She also founded Hay House Publishers, which has brought many wonderful metaphysical authors to readers.This book is a must for anyone looking to explore healing work. You also need to read ""Nexus: A Neo Novel"" a novel that explores personal pain and suffering of people gathered at a retreat intended to help them find healing and the center of the being, the Nexus."
4,Peaceful and not preachy,"You Can Heal Your Life, the movie, expanded versionIt seems that everyone needs a fresh kick in the pants from time to time. This DVD provides that without being preachy and overly forceful. My fellow viewers and I were pulled not pushed towards the healing results.This item is rated 4 out of 5 simply because there were a few too many guests speaking in the DVD and it became slightly repetitive. I bought one for my library and one to give as a gift. I really recommend watching it with friends."
3,Insightful,"Though some of the author's assertions are a little far-fetched: you can cure cancer by changing your thoughts, I found this book quite insightful into how our minds can alter how we view life. The writing style if very conversational and gentle, an easy read. I would recommend it to anyone that has an issue in life they have been unable to affect in other ways. This book provided a different prospective that other more common ""self help"" books. Worth the read even for the most opened minded of people."
5,Life Changing,"This is probably the 30th copy of You Can Heal Your Life that I have bought for someone. It completely changed my life back in 1990 and I continue to spread the word of You Can Heal Your Life and Louise Hay. If I had to condense this book into a few short words I would just say that it taught me that I was 100% responsible for my life, not necessarily what happens in my life but my reaction to what happens. That was very freeing for me ...... I am no longer a victim."
4,Choose your attitude,"This book is a little bit ""stuart Samlley"" from 90's Saturday Night Live. However, I think the underlying message of the book is very good. There were parts that I thought were a little hokey but I could easily get past them. Overall I very much enjoyed the book and I have tried to make myself have a more positive attitude from reading it and I think that was worth it for me."
5,This is The Handbook for Happiness,"The best self-help and self-improvement book on the market. My life began to change the day I started listening to the tapes (I bought the audio book.) The lessons that Louise teaches are simple, yet incredibly profound. If you want to appreciate and create more happiness in your life...no matter what your outside circumstances are, then this is the book for you. I also bought the workbook and have really enjoyed that tool as well. Save the thousands that you might spend on therapy and buy this book instead. It really is excellent."
5,Truly remarkable book,Excellent addition to anybodies self help library. I just keep going back and redoing the exercises and marvel at the changes in my life. Absolutely brilliant gift I give thanks for each day.
3,mixed reviews,i like parts of it and i don't like parts of it. louise hay is into energy and how energy works in the universe and for the most part i can deal with that. what i can't deal with is how she blames people for their illnesses and says if they change their thoughts they will be cured. she even states the reason for cancer and for lupus is on the patient's thinking. i hope she never gets cancer! maybe she's right but i seriously doubt that. while i do believe in a mind body connection righting your thoughts cannot cure the world of it's ails.
5,Great,This book is wonderful. Louise Hay has some wonderful ideas and thoughts on ways to improve your self and your surroundings. If you are open for change and positive thoughts this is the book for you :)
4,I need to read this again...,"I'm horrified by some of the negative reviews I've read here.This from one reviewer on the author speaking on AIDS:""So, AIDS is not caused by a virus, but by low self esteem. If people will just think better about themselves, their AIDS will disappear.No need to worry about condoms, or safe sex, or anything. Just maintain a positive attitude, and condoms aren't necessary.Such a lie is nothing short of grotesque. No, really, it is murderous.""I don't remember getting that at all. I took it to mean that if people had better self esteem and thought better about themselves, they would use condoms and practice monogamy/ safe sex, minimizing chance of contracting HIV/AIDS.I'm not sure how much I was reading into this book but I will pull it off the shelf in the coming days.It's a two-way street.Louise Hay's printed word is not the be-all/ end-all.She offers suggestions.It's up to us to think."
1,Unbelievably boring,"Don't bother. It sounds much better than it is. In fact, I will either re-list it or just not bother and donate it to a charity. I do not have time to read this drivel. Sorry if you were expecting some great revelation. You will not find any in this book. A huge disappointment."
2,I think think the information is redundant and the book is overrated.,I think that the technics to heal yourself are a little redundant.Over all I felt the book was a little disapointing.
3,you can heal your life,I enjoyed this book but it is a little bit old hat. I have read many books by Louise and although I greatly admire her it is a little bit repetative.
1,A Waste Of Paper,"So here is Louise's version of good and evil. Oops! I forgot, there is no such thing as evil to Ms. Hay. To those who read this book-if you want to know why you have cancer or AIDS, why it is because your attitude is not positive enough.And by the way, if you are in a plane crash-you attracted it. If you have food poisining, you attracted it. The message here is that you attract EVERYTHING in your life. Good, bad, or in the middle. Think Ms. Hay is just a little bit of a control freak?? HELLO!!!!!!! Sorry Louise, sometimes a cold is just a cold, and a cigar just a cigar."
5,A good gift,"Bought this as a gift, and my friend said she enjoyed it. She went to the seminar and had mentioned wanting the DVD."
5,A true healer,"All the ""this book saved my life"" reviews couldn't say it better. This book teaches people about the true nature of illnesses, and how to heal them. The best of all is, it works. Even if you're not going through a difficult illness, the information in this book is essential to anyone who wants to help and/or heal others. Or simply understand where do illnesses come from, and how to heal them from within."
5,Wonderful book! It saved my life!,This book changed my life! There are no words for how much I love this book and how it changed my life and healed me. I learned so much and still apply what i've learned from this book since I read it ten years ago. Louise Hay is a brillant woman and I'm thankful to have discovered her and her books! EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!!!!!!! Life Changing!!!!!!!!!!
5,Road map to healing!,"A good read, with very insightful, but realistic activities that help walk you through the journey of healing. She has been through what she writes about."
5,great book,my sister swears by this book ...she says it has changed her lifeI have read some of it and like it very much...its an easy read and full of good information....however since i am a slow selfhelp reader ....i cant read it in one setting...it will take me some time
5,Read this first before your holy book,"This book was introduced to me in 1992 during a painful divorce and I wasn't able to comprehend its gem like value. It wasn't until I rediscovered it on Amazon, and it is helping change my life before my eyes."
3,Looking for Info,"Hi, this isn't a review, looking for information about this book. I read all the reviews. My doctor suggested the book for me. I have been dealing with chronic health problems for many years. I have chronic pain, osteoartitis and fibromyalgia and endometrisos. I don't want a book that is going to blame me for my illnesses, as I read some of the reviews. I want a book that can help me somewhat deal with living with chronic illnesses. Is this book for me? Is this book for people that have chronic illneses where there is no cure?thank you."
4,Soulful and Inspirational,"If you are going through a transitional moment in your life, ""You can Heal Your Life"" is a delightful guide to help you keep matters in perspective and to assist you in taking that look inside. Louise suggests affirmations for positive thinking and methods of meditation for self empowerment. She will help you to train your thoughts so you can change your life."
5,The absolute best,Louise Hay has won the hearts and minds of so many people.This book is responsible for a major paradigm shift. People are reclaiming their personal power and this book is showing them how.
3,It was OK,This is an interesting book but was not what I anticipated. I was expecting a more in-depth book and not flashcards copied onto a page. At least that's what it appeared to be for me. Not enough substance for my needs.
5,You can heal your life book and dvd,You Can Heal Your Life in book form has been my bible for many years and watching the story of Louise Hay and her growth and beliefs over the years has made it that much more valuable. Anyone who sees this dvd will understand the truth inherent in her teachings. It is very human and down to earth and will definitely get you 'where you live'!We really do create our own reality. Watch this dvd and read the book and you will understand why.
5,Open your mind - your life can improve!,This is an excellent book that I will read over and over again. I have been using many of the teachings in this book with very positive results. Highly recommended if you are not totally relaxed and happy with your life - it gives you a perspective that will help you to enjoy what you have and to listen to what the universe has for you.
1,Heal your life,This book is very weak and it makes no sense.. The author went far in her own mind and tried to make her own fantasy into a reality.
5,Enlightening,"I loved the book and the simple positive way Louise exposes such deep serious topics as health, God, the universe, etc. Now I have to follow the workshop she describes and see if I manage to heal."
1,Seriously?,"I was really hoping this book would be helpful. I started to lose interest when it said that everything that happens, bad or good, is your choice. That's not true. I stopped reading when it said everyone decides to come onto the planet at a certain time, and before we are born we choose what we will look like, where we live, and who our parents will be. How am I supposed to take the rest of the book seriously after that? That doesn't even make sense."
2,Pretty pictures but not much help,"The pictures in this book are lovely, pretty enough to cut out and hang in little frames on the wall. The words of the book, on the other hand -- convey the very simple message of positive reinforcement.Look in the mirror and say ""I'm a kind decent person"". That's the entire msg of the book, along with alot of paragraphs about how many people the author has helped, and different patients the author helped, etc etc. But she helps them all by having them look in the mirror and say ""I like myself"". This is very 1970's golly-gee stuff. I would recommend the books by Manuel J. Smith instead of this series of books.... but the pictures again -- are luverly."
2,Bothered by the implications,"I am a firm believer in the importance of positive thinking and the power of the spoken word. However, I was bothered by the implication that the Author believes illnesses such as cancer are caused by the thoughts or words of the individual.I enjoyed reading her book until I got to the section that discussed the causes of illnesses.Don't get me wrong, I believe that our mental attitude, thoughts, and self-talk can ""negatively impact"" our health; but I don't agree that we ourselves cause illnesses such as cancer.I really like Louise Hay as writer, but this one goes too far.Dianne Rosena JonesAuthor of ""Tragic Treasures: Discovering Spoils of War in the Midst of Tragedy""and African American Literature Editor for BellaOnline"
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"This book was everything I hoped for and more!! Written simply with gorgeous colored paintings on each page, it is both informative and profound. Anybody that is interested in alternative energy healing and health alternatives this is a must have for your library! Just can't put it down and will be forever using it as a handbook to refer to again and again. Susan from Austin, Texas"
5,Anyone that has doubt about life should read this.,"I read this back in 1984, It I believe is a take off of Florence Shinn's ""The Game of Life and how to Play it"" written in 1925 Both these books are my spiritual guides more than Religous. They do work."
2,Heal your life,"I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend for both myself and my son. My dau in law briefly reviewed it and said it reminded her of all the other ""self-help"" gurus and when I started to read it, I saw what she meant. I've heard it before from dozens of other gurus. Waste of money as far as I am concerned."
1,Poor excuse for a self-help book,Poor excuse for a self-help book with no apparent basis in medical or psychological fact. Considering all the hype about this author I was very disappointed with the product.
3,"It is OK but not deep enough, it doesn't convince","I have been interested in the inner power to heal yourself for many years, I have attendend to ""Course of Miracles"" kind of semminars. Recently I moved to a country where you don't hear about this kind of things and I needed suport and particularly detailed guidance to heal a couple of new things that I experienced after I reached the new Country. I bought the book with the hope I would be able to heal myself, that I would find the answer I needed, but the book is too shallow for that, it goes around the bush. It is better to buy the small one that has the list of all the diseases ""Heal your body"". For a deep reading I recommend the book ""Anatomy of the Spirit"" by Caroline Myss."
5,All her best in one great book!,"Where Mind, Body & Spirit all come together---it's all here! This is an expanded version of 'Heal Your Body'---it has all of the same 'problem, cause, new thought pattern affirmations' as 'Heal Your Body', but with a ton more information as to the 'who, what, why, when & hows'. I have bought this & the workbook for myself & as gifts. If you can only buy one, this would be the one--it has it all in one great book!"
3,More for Relaxing than Dancing,"I bought this with the impression the album had more bass and funky beats. While I was disappointed that this wouldn't be a CD for most parties, I do like to listen to it to relax and let my mind flow. If you choose to buy this, I hope you get a better copy than I did. My case came broken (I can't open it all the way) and the first time listening to disk one, there were several skips in a few different songs."
4,would give it a 5 if it had a pressure release valve,"I purchased this tank back in august, a very good sprayer for the money, I do not recommend it for commercial use, its good for around the house. I would have rated it a 5 if it had a pressure relief valve. The only way to release the pressure, is to turn the tanks pump, but be careful, the pressure will release whatever it is that you are using and you'll get it all over you or worse in your eyes, make sure your wear protective eyewear."
5,Enjoying the more gentle westerns!!,This is a fantastic collection of Bonanza!! I have enjoyed sitting back and relaxing with the more gentle era of hour long shows. The quality of the dvd and the quality of the sound is great. I feel like I'm watching Bonanza on the color portable tv of days gone by. I LOVE IT!!!
4,A fine theater mystery,"I just finished this novel, which I bought because I thought it might contain a magician, albeit a dead one. Milos the Magnificent turned out to be a vaudevillian expert with a crossbow and possibly now a ghost who has decided to take up murder with the crossbow he used in his performances. Thus, Captain Bill Donovan of the NYPD investigates murder in a theater being refurbished to put on, of all things, ""Casablanca: The Musical.""I don't read many current mysteries, they seemingly being much of a muchness. But this one was most enjoyable in plot, dialogue, and characterization. The solution was weak, but did not detract from what had gone before."
4,A Delightful Book,"""Murder on Theatre Row"" is a good book. Have no doubt about it--if you enjoy a detailed setting, local color, well crafted plot, plenty of humor and human interest, some good writing, and a surprise ending, this is the book. I enjoy the hero, Captain Bill Donovan. He has a good girlfriend, he's afraid of marriage, he's a recovering alcoholic, and a self-taught Renaissance Man who enjoys learning and solves cases with his intelligence and research. The women in the book are the blackbelts and the tough 'guys'; the men are less stereotypical and more human. But the main character is the City of New York, its ambiance and energy; Times Square; and the Theater District. Only in this setting could this story occur...and that's a tribute to the quality of this book."
1,Poorly Manufactured DVD,"Having seen the old black and white version of the story, I was eager to see the DVD. I only had a few days to order it since the end of the school year loomed ahead of me, so I ordered it on Amazon.com and paid for special one-day shipping. Since I teach Freshman and eighth grade English, I like to show movies that back up the literature we're reading. Imagine my disappointment when I showed this video. Not only were the images blurry, but the sound was garbled! My students could barely understand the dialogue. I tried the DVD in another player with the same results. I certainly hope that Amazon.com refunds my purchase. This is the FIRST time I have ever had a problem with ANYTHING I've ordered from Amazon.com. I was disappointed and embarrassed that the movie was so poorly produced."
4,Carolina Table,"I'm really loving this table. I like the throwback style, and looks great in my kitchen. It comes with all the tools you need, and goes together in ten minutes. I got the chairs that are paired with it as well, and the whole set is working out great."
5,Very pleased with table. Love It! Great addition to my home:],"I just received my table and do have to say that I am empressed. To tell you the truth, after reading the other reviews, I was quite skeptical about purchasing this table. Like the hard headed person that I am, I went ahead and purchased it anyways. I didn't know what to expect when it first arrived. I read about how some people received only the table top or others received only the base. I was extremely happy to see the delivery man carrying both packages. Some people also mentioned that once they opened the boxes, pieces of the table were damaged/broken. After throughly inspecting all pieces, the only damage that I was lucky to receive is a slight, tiny scratch on the table top [which I can fix]. I am very satisfied with my table. I wish the best of luck to the next person that purchases it. I hope my review was helpful. :]"
3,Okay,"Looks okay, Not well made. 2 legs were missing adjustable screw case, was able to find at local hardware store. After time have found that if any weight put on drop leaf, then it starts to droop. Need to attach a piece of wood on back to plumb it up now. Would recommend it if not to be used in high traffic area."
2,Composit wood,"This table looks good..but has a weird finish on table top. A sticker attached to the bottom of the table says ""made from composite wood"" . Probably too expensive to return..but don't be fooled..it's NOT made of one piece of hardwood."
1,"Looked Lovely, Sub-Par Wood Cracked in Less Then 6 Months","This table has a lovely look and features folding sides, making it the perfect fit for a breakfast nook. However, less then six months after purchasing, and with only a few dozen uses, the wood has cracked on the tabletop. Used rarely by two adults, this table has never been abused so I cannot account for the fracture, except to think that the wood quality is sub-par. I also had fabric placemats located over the crack so I am confused as to how placing bowls or plateware would have been the cause. I doubt this item will be accepted as a return thus I may have to work a little wood compound into the crack and rely on placemats to cover the damage for future use. Overall it is just something I wish people to know as this would have swayed my decision to purchase the table."
5,Great book for notes.,My wife loves this notebook. The notebook is the right size to fit in her purse and it is also attractive. I recommend this notebook.
5,A delicious debut,"If you like your synthpop with club-ready beats and smooth vocals, this is the album for you. Along the lines of Rupesh Cartel, these guys make catchy, melodic songs that'll either get your body moving or let you drift off into introspection. It's definitely synthpop, but you'll also find elements of trance and '80s new wave (a couple of the tracks remind me of Tears For Fears). The best tracks are ""Elektronova,"" ""Nothing Is,"" ""Superfluous,"" ""Dead End,"" ""Angel,"" and ""Lovesong #1.""Their cover of Pet Shop Boys' ""Heart"" is good, but not mind-blowing - the singer tries too hard to sound just like Neil Tenant. The second half of the album loses a bit of steam, and I really wish the ""hidden"" track was just a regular track on the album - I HATE hidden tracks.Overall, though, the album is excellent. I think they're really going to make a mark with this."
4,Interesting old film without much depth,"The GunfighterIn the 1880's, according to this film, Jimmy Ringo (Gregory Peck) was the fastest gun alive. He is now 35 years old and tired of people trying to prove they are better gunfighters than he is. He kills his eleventh such young man in self defense and the man's three brothers say they are coming after him to kill him. He goes to a city where his wife and son live. He hasn't seen them in about eight years. He begs her to go off with him to another state or another country where people do not know who he is and try to kill him to get a reputation. She says it's too late. He is too well known. Where ever they go, people will know who he is and try to kill him. Will she change her mind? He is about to leave town. The three brothers are outside waiting to kill him. There is also another young man who wants a reputation. What will happen next?"
3,A big tough gunny,In the beginning of the movie the gun fighter weary from a long ride is having a drink at a saloon when a young gunny taunts him into drawing.In this movie an older gun fighter Jimmy Ringo comes to see his wife and boy: he has in mind changing his name and moving away from where he is knownas the fastest gun around. She says wait a year and come back.He agrees and starts to leave town.The whole point is that success as a gunfighter is a cursethat goes with winning a big name.It is a very good western about the gunfighter era of the old west.
3,All are good but none are great,I pick this up at the same time as The Westerner and that single movie has more talent than all three of these combined. The Garden of Evil has some beautiful cinematography but its fault is a plot that is awkwardly cobbled together from various sources.
5,"Ringo, the legend of Tombstone","In Arizona, Ringo (Gregory Peck) was a fast gun with a big reputation, but now he needs his gun just to stay alive. Everywhere he goes, he has to face some young hothead looking to best ""the fastest gun in the west"" in a fight. Older, wiser, and terribly lonely, he shows up in the town where his wife lives hoping to turn things around, but he's too late.Everywhere he traveled,trouble was all that he foundface-to-face with a man set to provethat he could shoot Ringo down."
4,Fox Western Classics,"For a western fan these movies brought back a lot of fond memories of the times I saw them first in a theater The Gunfighter, especially, I thought was even better than when I saw it at a young age."
5,Recovery Drink,This product is exceptional. It not only tastes great but after taking it after workouts I began to feel energized. I would highly recommed this product.
3,Fairly good,"I thought this guide was fairly good, but other guides are more appropriate for those seeking a career in investment banking, like the ""Vault Reports Guide to Investment Banking"" and other guides."
5,What a time saver!,"I had replaced my 96 Buick struts only, the end result was upsetting.Had a clunking sound on bumps. I bought the Monroe 171822 Quick Strut Assembly, which I installed in a quarter of the time. What a great ride I'm getting now. I will never replace only the struts again. By the time you buy the bearings, bellows, ect, you'll have allmost the cost of a complete assembly. Not to mention the danger and work involved in compressing the spring to chang only the strut. Do yourself a favor and but the quick strut assemly."
5,"Good, clean, multi-cultural fun!","On a recent trip to Kona, I spotted this book. I read it to my almost 2-year-old and he got quite a kick out of it. I like that all the adventures the menehunes exit on are fairly harmless. Some of the 10 Little...or 5 Little...themed books that I have read have the characters disappear under less favorable circumstances. I think my son is a bit young for that, and this book met my standards. I was delighted that I was able to pronounce the Hawaiian numbers for my son with the aid of the pronunciation guide. I know this is a tool he'll be able to use later on and it may even aid him when he starts using a dictionary. I think this book was a lot of fun, but found the first few pages (foreword and such) a bit cumbersome. After leafing past that...it was just great reading!"
4,Jeannie in TX,"I have to admit to being a big Ginger Rogers fan. She could really dance and she could really act. She had the ability to make you believe the full range of possible emotions. I don't believe this is her best movie but is is a good movie. It is definitely worth watching/adding to your collection, especially if you enjoy the old classic B&W movies. This one has a jury, which always provides a wide range of characters, who interact with each other, sometimes in unexpected ways. I think individuals who enjoy people watchings will really like this film. It's not about the trial--it's about the people, invested very quickly in their opinions. Sometimes it's just plain hard to find the truth."
4,Almost perfect.,"This compilation of The Dramatics' best romantic ballads from their Stax and ABC albums is something special indeed. The Dramatics were one of the greatest Soul harmony groups and stone classics like ""In The Rain"", ""Be My Girl"", ""I Can't Get Over You"" and ""Treat Me Like A Man"" remain standards on Oldies stations to this very day. In my personal opinion, the inclusion of ""Toast To The Fool"" and ""The Coldest Day Of My Life"" would have made this anthology even better--but I still love it and recommend it to any fan of romantic Soul."
3,Great food! Fun mystery!,"Catering to Nobody is a fun read for those who love food and mysteries. It can be too wordy and trite at times, but overall it is entertaining. I look forward to reading more adventures of Goldy Bear."
2,catering to nobody,The story was unbelievable and boring. I did not like the whole D&D theme. the recipes looked interesting. My daughter likes this series so will try one more hopefully it will get better if not I am done with this series
4,Dragged a Little,"I felt the book dragged a little. I enjoyed Goldy's tennacity, though. I will be reading more books in the series."
1,What???,"O.K.--the premise is interesting. Culinary mysteries. But the story doesn't make much sense, the characters lack any depth and the writing is, in many places, poor, or poorly edited. I was hoping to find another series of books I would enjoy reading, but I'll have to look elswhere."
3,Better than I expected,"Good beach read, no gratitous sex, violence, or bad language. In the style of Agatha Christie. Made me very hungry at times."
2,"Wimpy character, too much backstory","One common problem in first-books-in-a-series is too much backstory, and this one sadly provides a grim example. Davidson churns out information on character after character that the reader has no reason to care about yet, delaying the start of the actual story. Then it didn't take me long to realize Goldy is a wuss, a doormat just waiting to be trampled on. Although her ex-husband physically and emotionally abused her, she still expends effort to accommodate his whims, to the extent of preparing a non-strawberry accent for an event she is catering that she expects him to attend! Sheesh! Since I couldn't care for the character, I didn't care about the story, and quit about a quarter of the way through. The title related to the plot in only the most obvious way, that Goldy runs a catering business. The only praise I can give the book is that it uses good spelling and grammar."
4,A scrumptious first course!,"I've always noticed these yummy-looking mysteries on the shelf at my local bookstore, and I finally decided to try one. I must say, I'm quite satisfied! I enjoyed meeting the characters - Goldy, Arch, Marla, Pomeroy, and others - I think Diane Mott Davidson did a fine job in creating them and ""fleshing them out,"" so to speak. She makes you love the ones you're supposed to love, and hate the ones you're supposed to hate (for example, The Jerk).The story itself was quite enjoyable. I prefer mysteries where you really don't know who did it up until the last minute, but with this book, it's pretty easy to figure it out sooner than that. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to continuing this tasty series of culinary mysteries. Oh, and I think the recipes look delicious! I will certainly be trying a few of those (especially the Holy Moly Guacamole! Yum!)."
4,Catering to Nobody,"Good, easy reading with a plot. It's a book that can be read in an evening or two and holds your interest. A fun, easy read."
4,Very Pleased,What a wonderful way to be able to read a book. Who says everything has to be brand new to enjoy? I received my book in a very timely manner and it was in the condition it was listed as.
5,DIANE MOTT DAVISDON,"Love all her books.Light hearted mystery for those of us who do not care for the gory stalked type mysteries.Great fun to read, entertaining."
4,Great read!,"Light and cozy, I read it in 2 days. I couldn't put it down. Now that I read the first one in the series I know I can move on to the second! I fell in love with the characters and the location. I want to live in Aspen Colo."
4,Catering to Nobody 1,"This was a fun read, Goldy is so normal with everday concerns with a bit of murder mixed in. The food and it's preparation intergarated with the story fun and being a non cook this was also a learning experience. I will read the rest of the series."
1,Didn't get past the 3rd chapter.,Not a fan at all. I didn't get past the 3rd chapter. I found the main character to be truly unlikeable from the start and couldn't get past it.
3,Not her best!,"I have read many of her books, and enjoyed them! This was earlier in the series, and I guess I am partial to her later publications.She is great entertainment, regardless!"
3,Carering to nobody,"I enjoy her books so much. They are light,easy to read, and give your mind something to think about. The whole series is great."
5,Intelligent Caterer,This book was excellent. I have already read SWEET REVENGE BY this author that I wanted to read her whole series in order. I was not disappointed at all.Anyone who likes mysteries with great characterizations will love this book. The writing is smart and is very enjoyable.This book is first class and I highly recommend it.
2,Couldn't Finish,"I wanted to like this series. I really, really did. I love other similar books about heroines who work with food. But after reading a few chapters, I was not only depressed but thoroughly bored. The characters are superficial and the plot plods along at such a slow pace I couldn't take it anymore. It seems my view is in the minority, however."
4,Catering to Nobody,It was one of her better books. They have all been enjoyable but some stories are better knit together than others.
5,Pure Genius,"Rose is my favorite artist, hands down. She is the most talented songwriter ever, and her voice is bare and haunting. This CD is her first, and her most raw. Buy it now! :)"
5,His best .Sonny Boy Williamson,if you could only pick one CD to show as an example of his work this is it
5,good stuff,"This is very orchestral, fresh, and very good. How cool is Warp? Jimi Tenor and Autechre on the same label... scary."
4,"A true Heart-felt,eye opening book!!","I have read many books on this issue, and it was very touching to hear from a victim, perpatrator, and a survivor, like Shawn Michael Dove. It was very brave, and it had to be very hard to write a book like this---sharing his heart with hopefully thousands of others. He was very encouraging,letting victims know of their innocence, and letting the victims know that it is ok to share their heartaches, and pains with people and to get the help that they need. Very empowering book, a must read..."
5,For Those Who Love a Great Adventure,"The school text books never do justice to the incredible journeys of Columbus. Admiral Morison's writing is crisp, incisive and often subtly humorous. His special insights into the navigation challenges will particularly entertain sailors."
2,What a waste of money.,"I generally consider myself a savvy shopper but I cannot believe I fell for this product. The picture looks cute, but don't be fooled. Mine arrived pretty much dead. You can hear loose pieces rattling inside as you move it. It wouldn't read any CD or mp3 discs I burned, eventhough the manual says it does. To complicate matters, my daughter threw away the box it came in before I had a chance to return this piece of junk. Now I'm stuck with a $40 gadget that plays only FM radio. I probably should have known better. Oh well.======Update======I was able to return the piece of [...] to Amazon without the original box and Amazon kindly refunded my full purchase price. I suspect that Amazon already knows that this is a very defective product and I don't expect them to continue carrying it for much longer."
4,Nice product,"Great product for the price. The sound that this unit produces is what surprise me the most, deep bass sounds you can expect and a overall good blend of highs and lows."
3,Over-produced music and mediocre lyrics,"In general, this album is only mediocre unless you are truly a fan of Alain Souchon. None of the songs seem to have an edge and the music seems to fall flat. There is just nothing unique about this album. The exception to all of this is the amazing ""Le Baiser."" Quite possibly one of the most entrancing songs I have ever heard, Le Baiser conjures up rich imagery of North Belgium as powerful as that of Renaud's ""Mistral gagnant"" with a magical tune to support it. But in the end, it's not enough to save the album from the throes of mediocrity. Bref, buy the single, borrow the album."
3,Bloomability,"Bloombility is about Domenica Santolina Doone. She gets kidnapped but it is by her aunt and uncle. They called it kidnapped because Dinnie had no choice. Her family always moves from one place to another because Dinnie, which is Dominica, has a father that works for everything such as a painter or a builder. This gives a chance for Dinnie to be able to live in one house and haven friends at one school. Do you think Dinnie would be able to like it and stay there? Seeing different kinds of cultures at one place? I liked this book because it's not like any other book I've ever read before. I also enjoyed this book because it shows how Dinnie reacts to this change of place and family."
2,This book annoyed me on many levels!,"This book annoyed me more than most any book I've read in years. I really failed to see what the message was the author was trying to make. Perhaps that many of life's problems can be solved if you have the money or the luck to somehow be sent to a fancy boarding school abroad? Or that rich people who have travled the world have much more insight and are much deeper and more interesting than us poor folks? Or that if you have the money to get really into skiing, it will change your life? The most annoying part of all for me was the strange letters sent to Dinnie from her relatives back home. They seem to me to serve no purpose but to show us how narrow and boring ""regular"" folk are. I must admit I have not read other works by this author, and maybe that made a difference in how I viewed this book, and I must admit the writing itself was skilled, but I really would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Slow-moving and thoughtful,"When Dinnie is ""kidnapped"" by her aunt and uncle, she is offended that she couldn't stay at home. But with her brother in jail, and her unmarried sister pregnant, her parents want Dinnie to attend her uncle's international school in Switzerland. It takes a while before Dinnie is able to see the beauties of the country and the school, but she finally learns to love it.Drawn from the author's own experiences at the The American School in Switzerland. Ages 8-12."
4,Bloomability,"I had to read this book and do a book report for school. At first I said to myself ""oh no, not another book."" but after I started reading sbout Dinnie and the goings on in her new Switzerland home I got into it. I would stay up late and read a quarter of the book at a time. The characters in this book are just so interesting. It is fun seeing the world through someone else's eyes and learning about stuff that go's on in our world that you didn't know could happen. This is a great read and I encourage people of all ages to read this book."
3,it's ok but not her best,"Sharon Creech is one of the best authors I've known. Her style alters in every book. I first read Walk Two Moons which I loved and wanted to read over and over. It was my favorite book. Then I told a friend how much I loved Creech's books, and she then told me about Absolutly Normal Chaos which I read. Now Absolutly Normal Chaos is my favorite! Now I am in the middle of Bloomability and I can't say it is one of her best peices. It was a little boring in the beginning but now I am in to it,its ok!"
2,Disappointing,"Though I am a big fan of Walk Two Moons, and also enjoyed Chasing Redbird, I was not at all impressed with Bloomability. The book just seemed somewhat lacking, in both characterization and plot. I did not find myself caring about the characters, and I kept on waiting for something to happen. The book seems to consist of minor events that are not all that connected, and not all that important. Generally after reading a book I feel like I am able to take something with me, but I did not get anything out of this novel. I would not recommend this book, even if you are a fan of Creech."
5,Bloomablity,Sharon Creech did it again with another great book. Bloomability was probably the best book I have ever read. This book totally captured my soul with the way it expressed Dinnie's feelings about life. I also fell in love with Gurthie and his amazing spirit. Bloomability totally uplifted my mood and gave me a whole new outlook towards everything. This book was soooo great and I would reccomend it to anyone who wants to be touched by a book.
3,"Good, but little plot","Bloomability shows great writing and metaphors, but honestly, the book has very little plot. This is it: A girl-Dinnie-get's taken to Switzerland by her uncle and goes to boarding school. There she meets many people. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but don't all Sharon Creechs truly fantastic books have great plots? There's mystery, something that gets all pieced together at the end, and great adventure and action that keep you on your toes. There's death, romance, and stunning realizations about life. But Bloomability is, well, simply done. The charecter descriptions are excellent, I would recommend it to anyone whos read Walk Two Moons and Chasing Redbird and Absolutly Normal Chaos. But the plot definetly loses the books appeal."
1,THIS BOOK [IS BAD]!!!!!,This book was definitly NOT one of the good books i have read. The book just keeps yammering on about Switzerland and some girl named Dinnie! I was forced to read this book for the 6th grade summer reading project. It was so boring i could only read 1 minute at a time! So dont waste your time and read a different book!
2,Sort of boring...,"I liked how the book was worded but it went a little too slow. It wasn't really exciting because it was just about an ordinary school year of a girl who happened to have lived in various places, and how traveling to a boarding school changed her life. The book dragged a great deal at the parts that had their main focus on Lila. She was a very boring character; in my opinion."
4,"""Dinnie the Dot"" goes to Switzerland...","I have just finished reading Bloomability for a school book report. The description of Switzerland was so awesome that I decided to write my history paper about it! There's just one thing. Although I loved the characters, the book was just to fast of a read for me. I really didn't have to think about anything (so if you're the kind of person who likes that, you'll love this book) and I finished the book in three days! But not because I couldn't put it down.Now back to the story. Domenica Santolina Doone (Dinnie for short) has never lived in one place for more than a year. Her father keeps seeing ""new opportunities"" and once again the family is whisked across America. Then one day Dinnie is ""kidnapped"" by her Aunt and Uncle and is taken overseas to an Internaional school in Switzerland. There Dinnie learns Italian, makes friends each with a different character, learns to ski and opens herself up to the world.This is a great book for adolescent girls. Enjoy!"
4,Bloomibility,"I think that this book is great! It's a really good pick for readers. It's about a girl who is seperated from her family to go and live in a boarding school in Switzerland, in which her uncle is the head master! Mainly, if you like books about people trying to overcome their fears, and face the odds against them, this book is for you!"
2,It Lost Me,"I picked up this book expecting a story about a mature teenager who is trying to find her ""bloomabilities"". But I think i had the wrong expectations. This book lost me within the first 50 or so pages. There were too many characters and i felt the story moved too quickly. I just don't think this was the book for me, but younger teens will probably like it better than i did."
3,"Not the Best, Where's the Romance?","I'm sorry to say that this isn't a very good work of Sharon Creech. I loved the romance and dry humor that was found in Absolutely Normal Chaos, Walk Two Moons, and even Chasing Redbird. This book was rather thrown together, not much plotting, but plodding. Oh well, she did make some other bad low-reading level books like Soccer Shock. Just goes to show the maturity of writers as they write..."
4,"Great, but Creech has written greater books...","I have loved all of Sharon Creech's book since my teacher read Walk Two Moons to my class. We all adored that book, and went on to read Absolutely Normal Chaos, and Chasing Redbird. I think one thing you love about the books is how they all seem to ty in with another book she's written. I gave this book 4 stars because while it is a good book, I do think it could be better. It really didn't have much of a romance story that she usually includes and it didn't seem as unified, like many other readers commented. It's still a pretty good book about a girl who moved around a lot and then is sent to a Switzerland boarding school. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes Sharon Creech books, but I am looking forward to the next book and hoping it will be a little better. All in all, a nice story that pulls you in to it."
5,"A wonderful, I couldn't put it down, page turner book!","Since I go to an international school my self, I could totally relate to this amazing book. It is about a girl named Dinnie that moves to Switzerland and goes to the internatioal school there. Along with the great storyline and plot and wonderful dialoge, I loved it because everything that Sharon Creech said about living in a forgien country, I could absoulty relate to. Sharon Creech, if you are reading this, I would be honored to hear more about what you think about living in another country and going to an international school.Please write at dawson_creek15@alloymail.com I recommend this book to EVERYONE and especally if you go to an international school!!! Its great!"
2,BORING!!!,"This is an exceptionally boring book. Since I've read other books by Sharon Creech (Walk Two Moons, Chasing Redbird: Totally recomend them!), I thought that this would also be good. Boy was I wrong! Nothing happens. The girl moves to Switzerland. She goes to school. She meets people. That's it! No action, no real plot. Just rambles about some chick called Dinnie!"
