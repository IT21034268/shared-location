5,AMAZING!!!,"My friend told me to buy it and warned me that it was scary and I don't so SCARY BUT....I bought it because she made it sound so good. OK, i get the movie and wait 4 days until my husband can watch it with me. He decides that he doesn't want to so GREAT, I have to brainwash myself and put my big girl panties on and watch it ALONE. Friday gets here, my BIG day! I pop the first disk in and it had me GLUED to the TV!!! I wasn't afraid...well I kept peeking down the hall and had my sidekick/bodyguard (my cat Roscoe) by my side just in case something jumps off! Needless to say, all was well and I went to bed in 1 piece and woke up Saturday morning to continue to disk 2 with Roscoe by my side again...I didn't feed him in case we needed to move fast off the couch lol!! Can't wait to watch Season 2 - The Asylum!!! I've heard this one might make me call the paramedics... I'll be the judge of that...."
4,Shaking in my boots!!!!!,"This is a great series. I too thought is was a little too raunchy for regular cable. I kept saying "" This comes on t.v.?"" Nevertheless, I found myself scared and unable to easily fall asleep. I often screamed out loud watching this show. Thus it is a true American Horror Story."
3,Good,This worked out well for something that my husband and I could watch together but be prepared for creepy and twisted!!
2,I wanted to like this series!,But it was TOOOOO FREAKY for me. Maybe I'm becoming more square now that I'm in my 30s. I really wanted to be able to like American Horror Story.... My goodness this show makes me feel like a complete prude! :)
5,Love it,Not what I was expecting but very pleasantly suprised - my kind of creepy show - Jessica Lange makes it worth watching!
3,It gets better,Seems campy at first but by episode 3 it falls into place. Still shock camp drama but getting more interesting. The best character is Jessica Lange she steals every scene she is in and it is worth watching for her alone.
4,"Moira, Moira: Two Actors - One Role","This episode further challenges my early doubts about this series. The comedy-cum-tragedy tone no longer seems forced or hackneyed and the performances by the (quite large) cast are largely to credit for keeping the high-fantasy grounded. A certain pair of performances stands out most in this episode as being better-than-average: those by Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge as Moira the housekeeper. These actors have obviously agreed on Moira's mannerisms, vocal phrasing and emotive range and managed to remain consistent in their performances. It makes Moira's ""glamour"" trick mysteriously natural. On a final note - I'd have the same difficulty as Connie Britton's character ""Vivien"" choosing between Dylan McDermott and Morris Chestnut in my sexual fantasies. I can, however, definitely do without the man in the nylon gimp fetish wear."
3,"Just OK,","...can take it or leave it, but I'm a big fan of Dylan McDermott ever since his days in ""The Practice""."
2,My son likes it I don't,"I find this program a complete waste of time, with no plot or point. So I cannot see why anyone produced it at all."
5,American Horror Story Season 1,If you like a good Horror flick; this is it. Mind bending! I have completed the season; will watch again.
5,Awsome,The DVD set arrived on time and made a great Christmas gift. Would recommend it to anyone who likes this
4,Programming for the 21st Century,"I'm really torn by this series. On the one hand, it's very original, quirky, creepy, odd, and compelling. The acting is AMAZING, the characters are unforgettable, and the story is completely fresh. On the other hand, it's incredibly and gratuitously perverted, insanely violent, and it is very clearly a vehicle for social conditioning (some of you will know EXACTLY what I'm talking about). I suspect the target audience is older teens and twenty-somethings, but I'm sure there's a very substantial adolescent audience, too, and that makes me sick...but I still had to give it four stars.This is NOT for the faint of heart. Don't say nobody warned you."
4,surprised,"I did not think I would like this type of series. Was I ever surprised! I watched ,I was absolutely blown away! The acting issuperb and the story lines are great. I'm looking forward to viewing more of these episodes. If you haven't seen it yetgive it a try .You'll probably be as surprised as i was."
3,American Horror Story,I watched about 5 minutes only and didn't like it. My husband watches it so I gave it an okay..
5,A must see !,"Trippy, scary, creepy, intense, great actors. Highly recommend it. So worth watching. P.s watch it at night u will totally get into it:)"
5,Great Series!,A great and wildly inventive series that slowly builds up over time. This is a definite break over most recent horror entries. Can't wait for season 2.
5,Spooky and intense,I only saw the Pilot but I am already hooked. Very spooky but not corny by any means with interesting story line with just the right amount of horror. Not a bunch of gore or bad dialog. I will be watching the rest of the season at some point but if you have no desire in purchasing the season I wouldn't bother watching the pilot (sneek peek) because it will leave you wanting more.
5,love the series,"I really enjoyed rewatching this series. Originally I had watched it on Hulu while it was still running on tv, and having enjoyed it so much I purchased the season 1 through pre-order. And I've enjoyed it equally as much the second time round.For anybody who loves creepy flics and series, this one is excellent. Not to mention some excellent plot twists.I already can't wait for season 2 to air...As far as the dvd product itself: It's perfectly fine. I'm not usually the type to go through extras and whatnot so I can't say anything there, but the dvd's work and for me that's all that matters. :)"
4,Interesting show,"A very interesting show. I watched it all during the week leading to Halloween. It isn't a typical horror littered with jump scares (although there are a couple). There were a couple twist and turns along the way to keep the story interesting. I wasn't completely satisfied by the ending, but I don't hold it against the show. Good endings are hard to come by..."
4,American Horror Story,The movie arrived quickly and was new. it was in great condition and i love the series. thank you so much for this awesome series
5,awesome,I give the whole season 1 a absolute 10 star review. i enjoyed every minute. i am looking forward to season 2.
2,Not very clever...,"This series begins rather promisingly, but by episode 7 I no longer cared what happened to anyone. Really wanted to like it and gave it as much of a chance as I could. Weak character development, repeated scare tactics that become increasingly less scary. The re-enactment of Columbine style shooting is in poor taste...still..(hope no one involved ever sees this show) Heard the show was nominated for some awards, though I can't imagine why. Never get this $20 back. Darn."
2,Love the show but why do i have to buy it?,"I loved this show. I still love it. I came to Amazon because Netflix doesn't have it at all and FX has removed all of last season's episodes. I don't want to buy one episode or another and I don't want to buy the whole season I just wanna watch the whole season just once. kind of think its crappy there isnt a rent option for tv series on Amazon. I only gave it the bad review because of the fact they don't give the option of renting They could make a bundle off of me charging me 5 bucks for 3 days of this show. (5 bucks to rent all episodes for 3 days) right now i say i would only watch once but in the long run i would probably end up giving them thirty and then buying it at some point. its their loss.Other Than that,Its a great show. Cant wait for the new season to start."
1,Sex & violence for their own sake,The basic story-line is good. The acting is average. Most of the sex and horror do not advance the story. Sex and violence for the sake of sex and violence.
2,Yawwwwn...of the Dead,"Maybe it's because I don't have the emotional maturity of a twelve-year-old, but this turkey has taken me months to get through episode 6. I doubt that I will bother with more. The scariest thing about it is watching the characters give themselve lung cancer from sucking on coffin nails.AMC still has Breaking Bad, the best program left on TV, and The Walking Dead, a decent, if implausible horror series. They could take the entire rest of their lineup and cancel everything. I'd never know any of them were gone.American Horror is just that."
3,Started Off So Strong...,"After the first two episodes, the word ""SOULMATE"" haunted me. This show felt MADE for me! But it went downhill with the Halloween episodes and hasn't recovered. Ghosts riding in cars, meeting at Starbucks and constantly dry-humping teens is a little too much for me. It lost its sweet subtlety.I also don't like the Columbine parallels. This is not the right platform to tell that story even a little bit. One of the teenage ghosts quotes one of the murderers asking a victim, ""Do you believe in God?"" - not cool. To make it worse, when the flashback appears of Tate killing everyone the writers forgot to include that line when he kills the girl. Ugh. Bad on several levels.Jessica Lange deserves an award for her role though - AMAZING!!! I really want this show to be good and maybe it'll improve by the second season. Right now it's filled with way too many implausibilities - even for a ghost story."
2,Well-done but pretty stupid and even boring,"After watching about four episodes, I skipped to the last few just to see the outcome, but it wasn't even a surprise. Just not my kind of thing, I guess, and I don't understand why it's rated so high by so many people. Three or maybe four stars (questionable), I could understand, but not five."
4,Intricate Supernatual Intrigue Surounding Great Chaactes,"America Horror Story does something amazing: it sets us up for - not just 90 minutes of thril, chills, and terror - but for hopefully what will be seasons worth of intrigue, the unexplainable, and the unfolding of a family of chaacters who bing their own dimension to the multi-faceted show. Good fun, lots to keep us guessing, womdering, and scared."
4,A good scare!,"American Horror Story follows the lives of an average upper-middle class family who relocate to try and escape some demons from the past. Unfortunately their new house has some demons of it's own (real demons). I was hooked from the first episode, it is definitely a horror genre buff's dream and will leave you guessing each episode.I truly think it is a must-see but I can't help but wonder how long they can keep it going. Will this family just stay in a haunted house for eight years or so? I doubt it. Oh well it's great fun and I suggest it!"
5,Great show!,"Excellent, original horror story! One of the best shows I have seen for a long time. Great story lines and suspense. I will never miss an episode."
5,American Horror Story,"This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Not overly dramatic, and scenes seem so real. Scares me just enough where I can still sleep and not be terrified. Great story line, I am definitely a fan of this show."
5,Worth watching,"I heard about this show from various websites, thought I would give it a shot. Loved it! It's got a great mixture of suspense and weirdness to it."
4,American Horror Stories,American Horror StoriesInteresting series. Light entertainment. good for those interested in spooky shows and tongue in cheek.Relax and enjoy Jessica Lange
4,Entertaining and Creepy,I had nightmares but I could not stop watching it. Each episode leaves you wanting more and more. D. S.
5,Very good,"Really enjoyed this. Can not wait to see the next season. Good thriller and did not get bored, kept my intrest."
2,Targets Female Audience,"I think this targets a female audience, based on the characters, plot and setting. Too much drama, very light on the scares, and it is very clearly much more sympathetic to the women and girls. I only watched the first episode but for some reason Amazon wants me to review the whole season. I did make it through the first, and I won't bother with the rest.The horror itself starts off like an American horror movie but quickly degrades into something not quite Japanese...like American horror they want to shove the scary thing in your face, but like Japanese horror, well, it doesn't really make any sense."
4,Unique Tale of Horror,Bizarre but extremely well written and acted story. Jessica Lange is excellent. Made me look forward to season 2 !
5,Perfect!,Amazing quality video and sound for a streaming video! Would highly recommend to any fans of this genre. HD Quality is superb!
2,Meh,I'm a big fan of horror but this show disappointed me.I was expecting more scariness and chills but it just did not do it for me.Maybe I was expecting too much since it was a TV show and not able to show the shock and gore of a movie.
5,Creepy to the Max!,"I've been a TV junkie for years and thought I saw it all. I mean what can they do that hasn't done before? Well, they pulled it off. I've never quite seen a show like American Horror Story. You'd think a show like this would be on HBO or Showtime. Great job FX. Truly an original and already a classic!"
4,American Horror Delight!,Truly a modern day horror flick to say the least. I was/am amazed at what is thrown into the show.
4,Still a Leading Lady,Jessica Lange makes this series worth watching.... she's amazing and carries both and show and season over some less then great show scripts
2,Weird Show,This is just a weird show...like they are trying to be deep and cutting edge and it just comes off akward. Season 1 is better than season 2 though.
4,Great series,My family has been enjoying watching this series although we felt the first season was a little slow and the second one was alot more intense.
5,Now I'm Hooked On This Service,Got this very quickly andI loved this series. I can'twait for season 2 and 3 and4. Thank's
5,Best tv show ever,"This is the best tv show i've ever seen. If your a horror fan u must watch this show, the story has twist that will keep you wondering threw the whole season. If you like great story lines,murder mysteries,and/or ghost you have to give this series a chance."
5,Fantastic and creepy!,"Horror at it's creepy best, a great cast deliver gore and fright and sex all rolled up into one scarefest not to be missed!"
5,Awesome,A little terrifying and disturbing but well written and edge of seat entertainment. Definite must see. Can't wait to see the next season. Jessica Lange is great.
5,The Addams Family Meets The Shining...,"Well, well, well. So the Bogeyman is real after all. Forget all the things your parents told you when you were a child about the things that go bump in the night. The things that exist, or maybe rather, existed, in this house, do more than just ""bump"". Skeletons in the closet? Monsters under your bed? Mice in the attic? You ain't seen nothin' yet! Oh, and just a suggestion? When someone tells you the house that you're about to buy has seen some, shall we say, unforseen events in it; murder, suicide, and ghosts... just to name a few, maybe you should look, elsewhere?BOO!Did I scare you? No? Well hang on to your hats, cause this house, next door to The Last House On The left, will. Happy Halloween!Oh, and leave the light on..."
5,Finally...,"Finally a show on basic cable that is just as good, or better IMHO, than HBO or Showtime. I love horror movies, especially the psychological/suspense genre. I watch every horror movie that comes out, so I'm pretty desensitized to scary things. But, this show actually scared me! Scared like hiding my face under the blanket and yelling at the people on TV ""don't go in there"", ""don't go that way"". Love it, love it, love it. Better than any scary movie I've seen in years, so it's awesome that it's on TV. It's like a great movie that doesn't end after two hours. I really should knock on wood. It seems like every time I really love a TV show it gets cancelled. Or maybe my tastes are just more refined than the majority! ;) lol"
5,can't wait till premier offers the second season,this is my type of show. Have to admit when i saw the pilot wasn't sure if i was going to continue but when the pilot ended i had to keep watching.
4,"I was hesitant, but it turned out to be very addicting","Once I started, I got caught up in the characters and story line and the mystery of the show, it has great twists and turns in the plot and keeps you guessing the whole way thru. Really enjoyed season 1."
5,What a great series!,Great series.Wonderful series wish it could have gone on for more episodes. Kept me interested completely! I loved it!
4,Horror-Ghost-Drama,"Its difficult to describe this show. I usually don't like ""Horror""-Shows/Movies but it wasn't so much Horror as I expected. Of course, it contains any shockers but the show is more a Drama packed with/about Ghosts and a few horror elements.Its a interesting Show with very good actors: Dylan McDermott, Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, Evan Peters and as guests we see Matt Ross, Lily Rabe, Zachary Quinto, Teddy Sears, Christine Estabrook, Frances Conroy, Dennis O'Hare and as uncredited part as the ""Rubberman"" Riley Schmidt.Yes, the show its a bit different of others and a bit disturbing but interesting and very well made.The BLU-RAY (Regional CODE: A) : CONTAINS VERY GOOD PICTURE QUALITY AND SOUND.The Show contains english subtitles but not the bonus-features which are interesting.P.S: the second season has the same actors (Zachary Quinto gets a leading part) but tells a another/different story."
2,violence without meaing,"Every known horror with ghosts that have unknown motivations along with random horrific violence, characters with baggage put in a haunted house in one or two episodes without context. Nothing relevant to each other to create interest for continuing the series."
5,When is season 2????,"I caught an episode of American Horror Story mid season and became instantly addicted. I used my on demand to catch up on most episodes but had to buy episode 2 from amazon because I could not find it on demand and there were multiple references in later episodes to eventsI grew up watching scary and suspense movies and LOVE this show!! I also love Friday Night Lights and Connie Britton.... My favorite part about the show is that the ghosts cannot be removed from the show-- allowing for creative plot twists without character removal.Nonetheless, if you like suspenseful movies or shows, catch up on the first season now!"
4,The Horror,American Horror Story was well written & in most cases well acted the story line was great. It has made me want to purchase American Horror 2 as soon as it comes available from Amazon do yourself a favour and get it today!!
5,Addicted!,"I loved the story! It kept my attention throughout the series. I can't wait until next season! I hear it will be a totally different plot, which is very unusual for a series."
5,Love it!,"Best Series Ever! :) Couldn't stop watching it, very unique and exciting shows! keeps you wondering the whole time.. Must watch!"
2,Just plain dumb...,"If you like your characters to behave as if they were all 10 years old, then this is for you. If though, you expect people to at least behave in a rational, thinking, realistic fashion even 20% of the time, don't bother. Seriously, these actors should all be dope slapped for their behaviors in character and slapped again for taking these roles."
3,A little too horrific,I really liked season one. However this season is a little too over the top for my taste. Jessica Land is wonderful!
1,Sucks-Don't Buy,I absolutely hated this and I find out after I purchase the whole season that there is no way to return it for a refund. Thanks a lot Amazon. Customers deserve better.
1,what a disappointment :(,I really loved this show and thought the writing was amazing. This finale shows that it's just another show with everyone becoming super natural. It's going to now be a ghost opera just like what True Blood has turned into. So bummed :(
1,so bad,This is one of the worst pilots I have ever seen. It was disturbing on so many levels and it made no sense at all. The creepy boy that befriended the daughter was painful to watch. Bad acting all the way around.
2,not worth getting on dvd,"the show is alright if u want to watch it once, even though it's not really about anything. it has good acting, script, directing, bla bla bla it's all there but unless ur really really into horror, there's no use in watching it. it has no plot at all and the entire show leads up to well, nothing. the advertising makes it seem better than it really is. if u want to watch it, i'm sure there'll be some sort of marathan before the new series airs. but even if u like it, i doubt u'd want to see it more than once. getting it on dvd let alone blu ray just isn't worth the money."
2,TERRIBLE show!!,"I went into this one with high hopes...there are some good things about it, but overall, there are huge plot holes, unforgivable inconsistencies and poor, poor writing.Jessica Lange is great, as is Connie Briton. But their efforts can't make up for bad writing and a poorly thought out story.The final episode is just...bad! It's like the story finished with writing from a 12 year old. I can't describe to you how disappointed I was in this show. Forget the 4.5 stars, by the time you get to the end, you will regret it.It is a violent, warped show at times, but that is not why it sucks...it's just BAD."
5,Surprisingly great show,"Surprise is the best word I can give for this show. I first watched it because I was in the mood for something a little edgy, but it didn't take long for me to get completely taken in by the series. This show is extremely well written. I don't watch a lot of TV, and often think that TV shows lack a certain continuity to the storyline, like each week they come in and say, ""Okay, what should happen in this week's episode?"" I never felt that way with this show -- in fact, the skilled way in which they connected the episodes often completely surprised me; I don't expect the stories of TV productions to be this well thought out. It felt more like reading a really good book than a series of disjointed short stories. It has a wonderful cast as well, so you can expect great acting to go along with the story. If you are like me, you will be pleasantly surprised at how much you enjoy this show!"
5,Best Horror Flick in a Long time!,"This is seriously the best horror/mind bending flick I've seen in a long time. Week after week I did not want the episodes to end and couldn't believe how the time flew while watching it. After the first episode it leaves you hanging like ""what on earth just happened?!"" But by the 2nd episode you're hooked and wanting more! When this season was playing on FX...the next morning a colleague and I would discuss the episode and what we thought was going to happen next or what we thought was currently going on. My husband and I generally watch shows we like together (on the weekends - thanks DVR!), but both of us liked this so much we couldn't wait to watch it and did so independently and would talk about it after we both saw it. I can only hope that the 2nd season is just as fantastic as the first. If you don't like dark movies about the paranormal, then you're not going to like this...but for the rest of us, it was a treat!"
4,Really entertaining,The series starts off a little slow but stick with it. There are a lot of characters that keeps it interesting. the acting is well done
3,Intense.... at first,"The first episode I watched I got hooked. I just kept on coming back for more. After the 4 or 5th episode it got soooo boring. I barely could stay awake to watch it. Then on later episodes it got a little better but for me it just didn't keep up with the beggining. The story is simple with a few twists and surprises in store which makes them more interesting. However, I felt like I was just watching to see what happens and that intensity that I felt from the beggining was lost. I would recommend this to rent but I probably wouldn't buy it."
4,American Horror Story - First Season,"Arrived quickly and in good condition. American Horror Story -First Season is very good. Unexpected events, you must watch all of the series to fully understand the story."
2,"I love Jessica Lange and she's as usual excellent in this series, but . . .","I watched the full first season, mostly because of Jessica Lange (and because it was free).Each episode was pretty much a repeat of the one before it, just with a few more perversions and evil deads thrown in. By the end, even Jessica was annoying me. A mindless celebration of violence and gore."
2,Does not cover java 1.4 (NIO),"I will agree with the other reviewers that this is a really well written book.However, it does not cover using the NIO (java 1.4) networking API which is much faster and more efficient. So this book is very useful if you are still having to write for java 1.3.But if you are writing for java 1.4 (or 1.5), then it is of almost no value."
5,what can be better than a new battery?,Of course the battery was great - now why I couldn't get it at my local home depot? And what about battery recycling? Doesn't dewalt want the old ones back?Amazon was wonderful to deal with (ok the website was wonderful - no people) it's easy to use and had what I wanted.
3,Not Dewalt,"Despite the picture and copy that lead you to believe that this is an OEM Dewalt battery, it's actually a generic ""made in China"" version, but who knows - the same company may actually build Dewalt's. It's hard to tell any more. It seems to work fine at this point, but it's not what I expected."
3,"Good pictures, but rather an advertisment than a dog book",This is a book with a lot of good pictures. I was disappointed to later see that this book is constantly advertising dog related products. There is too much information about products like 'nylabone' chewtoys and 'Four Paws' flea repellents rather than the wonderful temperament and personality of the bulldog. This book gives a lot of information about general dog care and behaviour. But the book doesn't emphasize BULLDOG CARE and BULLDOG BEHAVIOUR.
2,Too general,"This book starts off great for a person first looking into buying a Bulldog, but at page 39 (of 160) the term Bulldog pretty muc disappears and it becomes a general book on how to raise a dog - any dog in any atmosphere.In fact I don't think a specific tip on raising/caring for Bulldogs appears at all unless a short line under a photo after page 39.Disappointing."
3,Informative,"This is a good book full of general information. However, if you want a book specifically about Bulldogs....this isn't the one."
2,Disappointed,"After all the positive reviews, I was disappointed in this book. I felt like it was another ""slice of life"" story that just kind of joins the lead characters life and then departs with no resolution to any of the plots that are began."
3,Poetry,The volume begins with a biography of Poe before getting to the poetry. I found the poetry difficult to read on the Kindle - with no punctuation and the lines and stanzas run together.
1,Don't Advertise it,Quit selling the product if they cant produce it. The release has been changed 6 times now. This make you the seller look bad.
1,Release the product!!!!!!!!,I would like to give you a review. This game has been scheduled to be released with 5 different release dates. I don't believe we will see it this year.
1,release date!,Does anyone know why they keep moving the release date back? If so please write a review and say why.
3,Patience fellows pit rats.......,Relax and have faith that the Ratbag crew puts perfection before quick sales.How many games have you bought only to have to spend two hours downloading a patch because it was promised to be on shelves before the bugs were worked out(F1 2000)?
2,If it would work it would be ok,The game I am sure is fine I have gotten it to work about 2 minutes before it shuts down then I have to uninstall and reinstall. then it might work for a minute or give an error. I haven't tried to make it work very much yet.
1,Couldn't get it to work,"I bought the game as a gift so you know how I felt Christmas day when I installed the game, got ready to play and when the green flag dropped there I sat. The steering wouldn't work and the brake pedal thinks it's the gas pedal. I called tech support 2 times, was on hold forever(not a toll free call) and received 2 different answers as to why it wasn't working. To which neither worked. My system is a Pentium III with 128 Mg Ram amd 20G hard drive. I don't think that's the problem. I've tried 2 different wheels. First was a side winder and now I have a Logitech. It works with another game I have so I see no reason for it not to work. If anyone else can give a suggestion I would appreciate it. I really want to play this game."
3,Pleasant juvenalia,"Don Procopio was written while Bizet was a student -- having won a prize that took him to Rome. He tried his hand at Italian comic opera and this is the result. Pleasant, harking back to bel-canto comedy, but hardly great music. It receives a competent and enjoyable performance on this set from pretty unknown performers, but it far from being a ""must get"" recording. It does round out a Bizet collection if you want to get all his operatic works. But it is not up to the level of his later works nor is the recording up to the musical or dramatic levels that you get in the good recordings of Bizet's other operas."
3,Comfy for your little one - - awful to drive,"I bought this stroller because it had good reviews. It opens and closes easily and it closes down rather compact for a larger stroller. I have a love/hate relationship with it, now.For all-day trips, it is great because it has a roomy sitting area that fully reclines. My son can sleep like a champ while we're on-the-go.Unfortunately, it is a monster to drive. It is awkward and terrible at taking corners. If you want to easily move thru a store with this ride, forget about it."
1,didn't fit as shown,"anxious to get my car protected, I opened the package and held the part up to see how it fit. It didn't...there was a large opening in the top from not sitting flush and couldn't push it in. I tried to return the items (2) and I would've had to pay shipping and restocking...not worth the hassle, might as well try to cut them to fit."
5,Chainsaw Sally's opinion,"Very original! As an avid reader (as in, I'm NEVER without at least one book I'm reading), I settled down to read this, not expecting anything more complicated than a basic Faust-ian plot. I was happily surprised. This has a good bit of very original plot twists. Quite often, when I was guessing what was around the next corner, I was wrong. And that doesn't happen very often anymore. I recommend this and (even more), the second book in the series - Witness:The Black Volume."
1,What's new about these?,I admit I don't know who Chris Maddon is but I liked the idea of this book so I bought it. I've gone back and forth through it but have never determined yet what exactly is new about these rooms. It looks like a simple collection of living rooms without rhyme or reason. I expect a lot more from a book than that and a lot more obvious effort on the part of the author in making me understand the point of the book and what ideas are in it for me.
2,A disappointment,"I got my copy. I love the cover living room. I was disappointed in the book, however. It's a nice collection of pretty pictures, but that's about it. I expect more than that from a book. There does not appear to be much thought in how the book is slapped together. The writing isn't very informative. I'd give this one a C-."
1,All smoke and mirrors,"Anyone hoping to find innovative design ideas here is going to be disappointed. The cover photo is very appealing but unfortunately that is where the interest ends. One certainly ""cannot tell [this] book by its cover."" Once open the authors do not provide anything ""new"" as the title suggests. Instead they have only compiled other designers' work (they have not designed any of the rooms) and have not even bothered to add any original thought or decorating ideas to the text. Why did they ""write"" this book? Ms. Madden and her co-writer, Ms. Hill have underestimated how transparent their lack of effort and content are and are foolish to think that readers will not see through their deception."
1,Hugely disappointing,"this book is a huge disappointment. i expected more for my money . i am ready to redo my living room so i bought this book. i don't know the author, but the topic was what i was looking for. the book doesn't help me much. it's a scrapbook of living room photos & many of those don't look like the way people really live. and there isn't much real help in planning your own room."
2,Worst case I've ever owned,I've had the true bamboo case for less than a month. The headphone jack and lock screen button was so difficult to get to that I had to spend half an hour sanding then down to be able to comfortably get to them. Then I had to spend another half an hour sanding the camera hole bigger so that I could take pictures with flash without interfering with the picture. About 2 weeks later a corner broke into 3 different pieces when I had it in my jacket POCKET while shoveling snow. The case is beautiful.. Yes... But it's not really worth all the trouble I had to put into it and its way too fragile for my apparent rough handling.
2,suspicious on/off switch,"We use (used) this in our school. It was fine, and worked well. After reading the other review I thought I should post this. After less than a year the power switch just quit working. Bummer, I am going to buy another document camera and it will not be this one."
3,Neruda's poems IN ENGLISH,"While a beautiful anthology, I was very disappointed to find that it is not a complete bilingual edition. There is a sampling of *some* of the original poems in Spanish, but if you are looking for a side-by-side reading this is not it. In all fairness, Ilan Stavans presents a formidable compilation of Neruda's poems, and several translations of one poem are included for comparison (demonstrating the art of translation), but if you are looking for Neruda's poems in the original Spanish look elsewhere."
5,Thorough collection,"This collection of Pablo Neruda is a very thorough collection of his work. It is also broken down into subject matter, which makes the book accessible for easy reading. Not to mention, the author is absolutely brilliant and one of the greatest poets in recent history."
5,Bewildering Yet Comforting,"If you listen to this album with headphones, you'd agree with me that this album is great. Don't get me wrong, it sounds wonderful coming out of a stereo system, but it's absolutely brilliant with headphones. The first time I heard this CD I fell in love with it. I am shocked at the fact that these guys are not signed. This album is beautifully woven together with jazzy guitars, funky bass lines, angelic synth sounds and heavenly vocals. From the opening chords of ""Sunset Valley"" to the childlike lyrics of ""Asunder Charm"" this album will leave you feeling refreshed, positive and inspired. If you are one of those people who are skeptical about the quality of independent music, this album will change your views. Fun with sound is well produced, the music and lyrics are fantastic and the artwork is amazing. I can't say enough good things about this album. It will leave you wanting more..."
5,Helpful,"After 23 years in the real estate business, I found this to be the best publication of its kind. It was well written and quick to the point. It is a must read for anyone who is looking to lease office space."
1,Reed Diffuser,This diffuser was so old that it had no scent. It was a total waste of money and I was very disappointed.
5,"HEAVENLY,BUT STILL EARTHBOUND.","THIS ALBUM IS AGAIN PROOF OF THE LACK OF JUSTICE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.I AM NOT GOING TO PRAISE MY HERO,BECAUSE OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE ALREADY.MUSIC THIS GOOD HAS NOT BEEN HEARD SINCE MARVIN GAYE AND STEVIE WONDER.CONNER'S BIGGEST HIT;EARTHBOUND IS MAGICAL,BUT EVERYONE WILL HAVE THEIR FAVOURITE TRACK.MINE IS ORDINAIRY PEOPLE.WHEN I HEARD THAT SONG IT CHANGED MY ATTITUDE TOWARDS MUSIC.CONNER REEVES STRIVES TO CONVEY EMOTION IN SONG.WITH EARTHBOUND HE WAS 100% SUCCESSFUL."
2,Spoke popped out and it cracked,"It did work well for many years as an occasional, three or four times a year item (even after one of the spokes broke off) but this Thanksgiving it cracked and leaked big time."
4,Meat Holds Sill for Slicing,"I've had this cutting board for over 30 years. Its great for holding a large roast in place while slicing. The only challenging thing is removing the metal gripper ring for cleaning. Prying it up using a regular screwdriver as a lever, makes cleaning a breeze.I've been trying to find this board to buy 2 & give one to each of my married sons. Finally, success!!"
2,ITALIAN BUBBLE GUM,"I HAVE INDUSTRIOUSLY COLLECTED ALL OF MASCASGNI, AND I MUST SAY THIS IS HIS VERY LOWEST POINT. BORING, REPETITIVE MUSIC, BUBBLE GUM LIBRETTO, ABSOLUTELY LACKING IN ANY KIND OF MELODIC INTEREST, AND EXPENSIVE RECORDING TO BOOT, WASTED MONEY. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SPANISH ZARZUELA. IT'S MORE GENUINE THAN THIS PRETENTIOUS TURKEY."
2,red licorice wheels,"I Love red licorice wheels and have a very hard time finding them. This is my second order from Hasbro for the wheels. now. The first order was very good, this last order for Christmas was quite sticky, and about 1/2 not all of the bag of the licorice tasted like perfume or something very odd, we threw them out."
1,"Slimy, inedible licorice.",The older Haribo red licorice wheels were wonderfully flavored and had a great texture. The current wheels have no flavor and are impossible to eat because of the waxy and slimy feel. I bought two bags of them and ended up throwing all of them away!!DO NOT waste your hard-earned money on these!
1,Get ready for a long wait,"I ordered based on the 5 star review and it's taking 2 months to receive. When I originally placed my order it was showing as available. However it's been a long wait. I was looking for Easter candy, might make it to me by Fathers day. They need to do a better job of fulfilling their orders, I'm going to be so annoyed by the time I receive it that I'm not going to like it no matter what it tastes like."
1,Not real Haribo!,"I bought these because I love Haribo gummy products. However, I was disappointed to see that they are made by Haribo France, i.e. not really German Haribo. And believe me, there is a HUGE difference. These ones are very, very greasy, not soft and have almost no strawberry flavor. Don't waste your money!"
1,Just awful!!!,About 1/3 of the bag had a medicinal taste to them. It was awful! Almost as if you sprayed the most awful smelling cologne on th before you put th in your mouth!!! Just awful!!!
3,Not the freshest product - chemical taste,"Compared with the black licorice Haribo, this product seemed not as soft and fresh. Some pieces also seemed to have an unpleasant chemical taste to them. It's hard to know whether this was just a stale package or if the formulation differences between the licorice flavor and strawberry flavor cause the significantly worse texture in the strawberry product, but if one really loves strawberry licorice, you can still manage to enjoy this product. Overall, somewhat disappointing. Not sure that I would buy this again."
1,Not good anymore...,"I've bought this same product from another on-line store and something has changed. First, the color is different...they used to be a very deep red, almost burgundy color. It seems when the color changed, so did the flavor. They are slimey and stickey, just like the other reviews said. Won't buy these anymore from any store!!!!"
1,"Pretty, but not good!","Very pretty candy, but have no flavor, really bland, not good. Everyone at the party got a few and all of them went directly to the trash can. Don't bother to buy."
3,mediocre soul cd,"The category for this CD shouldn't be rap, but soul. Celetia is a soul-singer from the UK; this is her second album. The hit single is ""Rewind"", which is all the ""hit"" there is on the album unfortunately. It's nice and mellow but nothing more."
3,They need to include a gift card option.,I got this as presents for several people. They all said it is really good. The only frustration is that the online form doesn't have an option to include a gift card. That would have made my Christmas shopping much easier and earned this nut mix a five star rating. They should also show the amount per package.
5,Funny and charming!,"Losing It is by far my favorite Red Dress Ink book yet! The main character, Diana, is full of acerbic wit and humor despite the challenges she faces in her life. She is genuine and endearing, as is her relationship with Mrs. Bartle. While most Chick lit I've read is almost stream-of-consciousness, heavily focused on voice and going off into tangents instead of advancing the plot, this novel is a great combination of a distinctive voice and a clean, evenly-paced story. It's sweet, sad, realistic, and sometimes, romantic.Losing It breaks away from the traditional single girl out for a man and touches on issues of self-esteem, relationships-romantic and familial, and friendship. In a way it reminded me of a combination of She's Come Undone, Bridget Jones Diary and Jemima J. It has the feel of intelligent and emotional chick lit, and is at the same time cool and cutting edge. I highly recommend this one!!"
2,Not lit at all...she lost me,"This is a sad, depressing, hopefully not realistic book. I thought it would be fun...Boy, was I wrong. Diana is a most disconcerting character, her life is an endless series of rejections and humiliating experiences, even when she gets thinner. The highlight of her days is dining with her 93 year old neighbor. Her misery really ends only when, of course, she finds, or better finds her Mr. Right - again. Splendid.To think that this is a young writer...With some adjustment, this novel might have been written in the 1800."
1,Wally Lamb should sue this woman,"""Losing It"" is nothing more than a pale rip-off of Wally Lamb's transcendent ""She's Come Undone."" I mean, really, am I the only one to see the many similarities - overweight woman, outcast of society, old-lady best friend, gorgeous but ultimately treacherous guy, mental disorders?However, the difference between the two novels is that Lamb is an incredibly sensitive writer, capturing and expressing his character's emotions perfectly, while Rech's writing is totally lacking in sensitivity. She is incapable of expressing her main character's emotions, and has to resort to ridiculously blunt statements along the lines of ""She was happy. She had an epiphany."" Also, Rech's pathetic attempts at humor and lightness are (excuse the pun) laughable.Ms. Rech, if you absolutely must write another book, I strongly suggest that you think of your own plot, rather than stealing the plot of a much better novel, which just serves to highlight your inadequacies as a novelist."
3,"Amusing, but not a keeper","This book was a diverting read, but not much more. I was disappointed in the deus ex machina ending: heroine goes over the edge after which much is revealed that makes everything okay now. The resolution of the relationship with her mother was just too pat and neat, and Barry's character is too saintly to be believed -- for instance, his failed marriage was blamed solely on a pathologically unfaithful wife.The fiancee of the hot guy in the pool hall was a terribly bitchy cariacature of the ""pretty girl"". And, to restate the opinions of several reviewers here, since when is 178 pounds obese? Catherine Zeta-Jones has said that she got up to 180-190 during her pregnancies, and did she ever look less than amazing?"
1,What a mess,"This book creates a world in which a size 16 woman is the approximate equivalent of a hippopotamus, no woman over size 10 can ever get laid or hired, familial trauma is worked out with one good conversation, and making up with your statutory rapist constitutes romance.Want more? How about the stilted dialogue, lifeless characters, shifting motivations, poorly chosen point of view and awkward stereotyping?Since the author is only 25, I can give her a break. Very few people can write themselves out of a paper bag before they're 30. The people who cannot be forgiven are the RDI editors, who are allowing more and more shlock to slip through each month.I haven't been this annoyed since ""Dating Without Novocaine."""
1,Wish I could lose this book!!!,"God!!! The main character so pathetic I wanted her to ""end it all"". She let everyone step all over her, just taking it? Why? because she was ""obese"". This entire book seemed to say, ""If you drop a few pounds and wear a little make-up your life will fall into place"". I truly loathe books like this, because it implies that only as a size 4 can you be happy and have a good job and fufilling relationships. This book really aggrevated me, there are so many other books that RDI offers, don't waste your time on this one!!!"
4,Good Tool,The Dewalt grinding cup is a nice tool and works perfectly with a 4 inch angle grinder. To bad I didn't know it was cheaper at the local LOWES.
5,A great and beautiful CD,"This is a great CD. I just got it, and I haven't listened to the second CD a lot yet, because I don't want to quit listening to the first one! Number 7 is the type of music they would play in heaven, if there were / is one. It is a very spiritual CD, at least that's what I get out of it. Some of it is dance oriented, and some of it is just beautiful, deep music."
4,Oakenfold continues to impress,"The thing that sets Oakey apart from many other DJ's is his impeccable taste and knack for stringing together melodic and grooving trance/house tracks. He doesn't disappoint on these two CD's, and the 2nd CD is one of the best mixes he has produced. The first CD is also pretty good with the exception of the ""Bullet in the Gun"" track re-mixed by Rabbit in the Moon. I don't know what he sees in this song other than maybe he's trying to get some exposure for it since it's a Perfecto release. Another slightly annoying feature is the voice overs in between tracks. This obviously appears to be an attempt to appeal to American tastes, but it just ends up sounding a little corny. Having said that, the music makes up for these minor defects. A worthy addition to your collection."
3,Sample first.,"Well, I honestly expected more from Oakie. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good material on it but I thing he's departed from the element that made him famous in Tranceport and Global Underground. I personally like the second CD a lot more than the first and I may buy it just for that (I listened to my friend's CD) but if you want quality Oakenfold and still haven't purchased Tranceport 1, GO GET IT NOW! As for Perfecto, it's a good set but don't expect another Tranceport."
3,Yeah Paul,"OK, so I would be bored out of my gord without oakey. There isn't a day that goes by that one of his albums is not pumped into my head at a rediculous volume. So naturally, when I herd that there was a new one that would be released I was rather pleased. So of coarse the Tuesday came and I went out and bought Perfecto Presents... So far I have made it through this album one time, and I have not put it back on yet. I think I'm just not ready for it. Oakey will be on the east coast in Nov/Dec so after a night of beat and dance I will have changed my mind. But as of now this is not the Oakey that I would pick up especially if you are just getting to know his music. Peace, Duppy"
2,Definitely not his best work,"I am surprised that so many people rated this cd with 4-5 stars. I agree with some of the other posts that he is trying to ""mainstream"" his music and in the process it has lost some of its edge. The cd is very disjointed. The second cd in my opinion is better although the tracks from the Insider are a little too slow for my taste. The one statement I can agree with is that this cd is different unfortunately different in a bad way. This CD IS NOT worth it if you like a good mix of continous trance/techno music."
2,Not for me!,"I was pretty bummed today when i got home and put this CD in after i had bought it. I was excpecting something alot better than what i got. I thought it was going to be faster with better beats, instead just about all the songs were slow. [To me] this CD is really boring. Im kinda bitter about it and wish i hadnt payed [a high price] for it....but yet this is just my opinion. I just suggest to anyone interested in Paul Oakenfold that you check the CD out before you buy it, that way you wont be dissapointed like me."
2,Really disappointed...,"Was this Pefecto records or Paul Oakenfold screwing up a potentially great album? I should have known better when I saw the cheesy commercial on MTV. Not anywhere near Sasha, PVD, or even any of Oakenfold's usual stuff. The annoying chick that comes in randomly with stupid one-liners are totally useless and annoying - things like ""Are you going to the club?"" However, I did appreciate some of the new experimental styles Oakenfold had to offer."
3,I expected more from Oakenfold,"Being a fan of Oakenfold for a few years now, I rushed out to pick up this 2 CD set as soon as it was released only to find that it fell fall short of my expectations. Disc 1 is, with the exception of the RITM mix of Bullet in a Gun, rather weak. With tired beats and mixing short of spectacular, it actually has a rushed feel to it, despite its lack of any real sound. Disc 2 redeems the set. Oakenfold combines some fantastic vocal tracks to create a dreamy, progressive sound. Song to the Siren and Flesh are two of the best tracks on this disc. If you can make it through the five minutes of wailing in tracks 6 and 7 and where he drops the beat to insert blatant commercialism (no, I am not listening to perfecto radio... I paid $15 for the CD) you'll probably like this one. If you don't have any of Oakenfold's other stuff, I suggest you try that first... at less than $15 this collection isn't bad, but its not what you'd expect from a master like Oakenfold."
2,not at all what I expected from Oakenfold!,"Having been a fan of Paul Oakenfold for some time now, I was really excited about this release. I have to say, however, that it does not at all live up to my expectations. Though the second cd is decent, the first one is very bland and lacks the signature punch that Oakenfold is known for. If I were you I would save my money and buy Padilla or Tiesto's new cd."
2,What a disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Mr. Oakenfold. Not many DJs on this planet are capable of mixing the variety of music he does. This release, though, is without a doubt the most punishing of all his CDs to sit through. What was he thinking? Get either of his global underground discs or transport instead."
1,trance [stinks],"I do not understand what is wrong with people who say that Paul Oakenfold is a good dj. Maybe they have ruined their brains from taking too much e, I don't know. This is not music and this is not proper spinning. Playing a record for ten minutes and mixing the last thirty seconds in with a new record is not talent. Boring, repetitive, cheesy, unoriginal, unimaginitive, repulsive. Try Derrick May, Jeff Mills, Ritchie Hawtin, Stacey Pullan. Try some Chicago house. Educate yourself on real dance music and stay away from this pathetic excuse for a 'mix' cd."
2,Even Paul disappoints sometimes.,"Other than a couple of good tracks, most of this CD is not that great. Wonder how Paul finds time to produce and tour and put together all these mixes, the result, a CD thats not great . Well, some people will eat anything Paul puts out anyway. Maybe he should focus on making a cd that'll just be the mother of all trance CDs."
2,one word ---> DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Upon first receiving this CD to review for my radio station I checked out the track names...as I also spin trance...He's got some good tracks on the cd (Chilled Eskimos, Timo Maas. LSG, Max Graham, Branccancio & Aisher, Jamez, Blackwatch)...However a lot of the others are just chessy proggy trance crap. In addition to this Oakenfold has chosen to insert cheesy self promoting samples ""Are you going to see Oakenfold?"", ""Perfecto Radio...Miami!"", ""Trancegiving at the Roxy!"" which only serve to ruin the songs and any mood his cd may have created. The majority of his mixes are done during breaks in a song, creating for a boring cd from a dj who is capable of so much more. Some people have said that this cd is a new journey...I say spend your money on a REAL journey and buy Dave Seaman or Anthony Pappa instead."
5,A defining moment in the genre,"This is a brilliant two disc album. It reminds me of Digweed or a trancy Nick Warren, but it has a gentler and more refined feel to it. I prefer listening to disc 1 over disc 2. I realize that most people who have written reviews tend to like disc 2. I initially enjoyed it more, but disc 1 grew on me and is a mix of inredibly powerful progressive trance with each mix flowing perfectly to the next. It is for the more hardcore fan I suppose because it is harder to swallow at first. This is one of the few trance albums that I regularly listen to - I typically am a progressive house listener in the vein of Hernan Cattaneo/Howells/Lawler/Lavelle/DJ Dan. Oakenfold really takes the genre to some strange places and they seem to work well.One ""bad"" thing - I could do without the voice samples of women saying things like: ""Are you going to the club; are you going to see Oakenfold?"" But hey - it's not an album ruiner by any means."
5,Perfecto,Great CD. Enjoying and enjoyed it when I first got it.This album is great and the songs blend together nicely. I highly recommend this CD for parties and for background music. It's great!
4,Dope Tracks,"Sabel Song to the Siren, I CAN T Beleive that this CD includes this! its a very tough FIND!"
5,one of the better oakies IMHO,"all in all a good cd esp. to get drunk and chill to, the beats are there if you want them to be"
2,Not for me!,"I was pretty bummed today when i got home and put this CD in after i had bought it. I was excpecting something alot better than what i got. I thought it was going to be faster with better beats, instead just about all the songs were slow. [To me] this CD is really boring. Im kinda bitter about it and wish i hadnt payed ...for it....but yet this is just my opinion. I just suggest to anyone interested in Paul Oakenfold that you check the CD out before you buy it, that way you wont be dissapointed like me."
3,Another Oakey Snuggledisc,"Don't take this the wrong way, Oakenfold has been one of the most consistant DJ's in the scene (which explains his entry in the Guiness Book of Records), but what keeps him from earning a spot as one of the most influencial DJ's in the scene today is that he lacks the ability to really move in the direction that music is going. Tranceport was a great set because it was the cutting edge sound of four years ago, but electronic music has really evolved alot in that time. Perfecto is a good collection of progressive house and house anthems, and sounds pretty much like every other Oakey compilation. Too bubblegummy for me though.Perfecto Presents Another world is new music from the DJ who has been know to put less than significant effort into his work (take Global Underground New York's weak mixes for example). Being a house/trance DJ myself, I just expect someone like Paul Oakenfold to be more cutting edge."
2,dissapointed,"clearly he succeeded with his intention, of continuing to push his name. i used to be as zealous about oakenfold as many of the ppl here who call this mix 'life changing', but i have two main complaints: first, agreed, he's a great dj. but isn't he just playing, uh, other peoples tracks? everybody is talking about how oakenfold is god, what about the ppl who *wrote* the music? but that's dj culture ....second, the voiceovers! omg, i thought the e'd up revellers on his cream comp. were annoying, this is enough to deter me from the playing the cd. and since the exact same tracks are on about 203948 other mix cds, it's not difficult to do."
4,Broken groove!,"This is a great album, as usual for Oakenfold. However, there are too many breaks in the flow of music. So expect both CD's grooves to be broken up by tracks that were borrowed from what sounds like an opera. Still, good stuff. Definitely a must buy."
1,Wake Up Oakenfold,"Oh dude...When my friend told me he heard about a new Paul Oaky CD coming out, we both got psyched. Yet, when we put the Cd in, we were utterly dissapointed. It was slow, and nasty. It lacks Oakys touch, and does not live up to the greatness of Tranceport, Global Underground: New York,or Cream. Yet, this Cd will continue to go over well, because the MTV watchers who listen to Christina Aguilera and Brittany and actually think its ""good music"" will eat this CD up like Pez candy, because it overcommercialized .... Oaky, stop trying to appeal to the ......typical American and go back to your roots"
1,disappointed,"I bought this cd only for the one song, ""The host of Serafim"" by Dead can Dance. Oakenfold had a video on YouTube of his re-mix and it's the version I wanted, apparently this was the only album it was available on but when it came it was a 36 second version of the one on YouTube. Oh well, if Amazon let you listen to the whole song, or at least told you how long the tracks were, it could have prevented me from buying this."
5,Only Oakie could do something like this,"Ok, when I first listened to Another World, I didn't know what to think of the first cd. I think its more of an Enya type cd that you just listen to because its so unique. Oakie is a musical force in his own right. Most people don't know about him but everyone has listened to work of his at one time or another, a lot of big stars come to him with their albums before they're put out, but I digress. This album is good but I wouldnt really play it on a dancefloor, its more to just listen to."
3,some good.. some bad..,"This Oakenfold Cd has some really good tracks on it but also some that disappointed me.... Personally i think ""The Silence"" (last track on CD 2) is some of his best work ever... However.. there are some tracks that aren't even trance present on the CD... After seeing Oakenfold on November 18 2000 in Atlanta I know he is capable of better work... If you are an avid Oakenfold fan then you have to buy this CD just for the few amazing tracks that are present... but if you only own one or two of his CD's i suggest you go for Tranceport or Global Underground: New York... enjoy..."
2,"Trance, Perfecto","I have Paul Oakenfolds other Perfecto Album and this one is a far Second from the other one.Its more Trance and less vocals, so I guess I'm just commenting on my taste in music. My appologeeez....I do not recommend this one as much his others.It seemed like more of an experiment, so find myself going to the next track, or skipping these 2 albums on my IPOD.GET BUNKA, and Tranceport"
1,a big disappointment!,"i love danielle steel! i`ve read ALL of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned,ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins (some explicit ""parts"" i didn`t like at all).simply NOT the danielle steel we like. the story itselfs is ok(gives the readers some ""insights"" behind the scenes of hollywood)but....some of her books i`ve read over and over again. i am not going to touch secrets for a second time,however."
3,Not happy with Kindle,"While the storyline of this book was enjoyable, the clerical errors of the Kindle version was extremely frustrating. This has been a noticeable problem with many of the Kindle books I have read, but this one was by far the worst I have seen. Letters are replaced with symbols throughout the book, I don't know if this is a Publisher's issue or who exactly is to blame, but I was ready to throw my Kindle in the pool while reading this time!"
3,Too predictible!,"While I thought it was an OK book,the story was so predictible. Steel could have really thrown in some surprises and made the story a lot better."
5,Superb!,Some noble soul in another book review had mentioned the name of Nathan Ida and so I checked it out and then bought it. I have worked with it for a month now and I must say that Mr.Ida has done a superb job. I had Mathematical Physics in College where we followed Kreyzsig but Ida is realy great.
3,DON'T USE A MODIFIED SINE WAVE INVERTER INSTEAD,"One of the reviews here suggests using a modified sine wave inverter such as the Xantrex sold here at Amazon. If you read the inverter owner's manual or do a quick Internet search you will see that use of an AC Dewalt (and some other cordless tool chargers) together with a modified sine wave inverter will dramatically shorten the life of your charger. Don't do it.As for this product, it works as advertised. Why only 3 stars? 2 reasons: A) At the current price this item really is overpriced for what you get; B)The (50% less costly) AC charger offers ""Tune Up"" mode, which extends battery life. But if you have no access to AC power this is the way to go."
4,One of the best things on my work truck!!!,I was given one of these by work. Too bad I have to return it if I leave. Everyone that has any type of DeWalt tool should have this charger.
5,The best hunting game in the world,"This game is awesome the deer's artificial intelligience they follow trail at certain times to bedding areas they heard together realistically.go to deerhunter4.com to see screenshots and everything else you need to know about this game,thers too much to tell go to the website"
1,Did not work,"This product didnt work at all, didnt wind up or play music. It was supposed to be a gift and arrived on time but didnt work."
3,Comfortable and quality silicone,"The silicone used in the product is of high quality, but the inserts can move pretty easily inside of the shoe, making for an uncomfortable fit at times."
2,Terrible,"These are a waste of money. The ""hump"" that is supposed to provide support is so small & weak. It did not provide any support - I could barely feel it. On top of that, it constantly slid around in my shoe, so it never stayed in the right spot."
1,Reduced quality from the leader,"This 12V DeWalt is quite disappointing. It comes with smaller, lower-capacity batteries, cheap switch, and has a lower speed than the true DeWalt tools. Obviously intended for the occasional user, it makes me wonder what else they scrimped on.Save your money for a real DeWalt, which can be identified by the black soft grip handle, or buy Porter-Cable or Makita."
2,wimpy,"Although this drill is compact and works OK for lightduty drilling/screwdriving, it has several drawbacks. Many a coworker has picked mine upto use it, and then stand it on the battery only to find a big dent or scratch in a finished floor from the drill falling forward. Ive owned mine for 2 and1/2 years and the batteries are so weak I can stop the drill with my bare hands.Never did have enough power to drive Tapcons."
3,Fits smaller than actual size,"If you are buying this make sure you buy a larger size that you actually wear, because the size runs small."
1,Misleading Price,"The soap is fine and I have no problem with it, but the marketing says a ""a pack of 3"", which is just not the case all. I ordered 4 packages of three thinking I would recieve 12 bars. That did not happen I recieved 4 bars even, and so I paid nearly double the price for the same soap I can order at the local drug store. Well ya live and you learn. Sometimes you get a good deal on Amazon, but this soap is not a good deal."
5,"This help the wife with sensative skin, and it was Dr recomended","Her hands clear up as the regular soaps gave her some issues due to parabins, her Dr recomened this as a treatment for her allergetic reaction to parabins."
1,"Low priced, high cost.","My card worked great for 2 months, then I got a corrupt file error and lost most of my photos from my Cruise vacation. The camera was never dropped or wet, and the backup Kingston 1GB worked like a charm afterwards. Well worth it to pay for a more quality product from first-tier makers."
2,Reminds me of that J88...,"Slums best work is on Fantastic volume 1 and volume 2. All that other miscellaneous stuff is just wack...this album included. I can't wait for Trinity to drop. I hope Jay Dee is doing all of the production (even though he did a terrible job on Welcome to Detriot). And whoever said that Slum comes correct with the lyrics must be bugging! The production and the flow is dope, that's why I like this group. But they are, by far, no lyricists!"
4,NICE!,"This CD reps for the real hip-hop fan beats wise and lyrically, which is hard to find these days. I know it's not actually Slum Village, but I do respect SV for puttin' this together, something new. I will be coppin' the Trinity CD when it comes out though. Beleedat!"
2,Save Your Money!,"I was extremely disappointed in Dan's book. Really, it was pages and pages of reference to his website, where, in the book, he tells you that you can go to find valuable information. When you go to the site, you find that the ""valuable"" information is just that--valuable (highly priced). This book is nothing more than a sales pitch. Its amazing that someone can sell a book that is really just a sales pitch for high priced seminars and pricey information."
4,Part of My Evolution,"You'll learn a little or a lot, depending on how many of Dan's books you have read. He is always trying to sell something to you, duh..... If you don't take something away from all of his books, then there is no hope for you. Dan is not Wham Bam Thank You Mame......."
5,Shaune Clarke,This guy doesn't just live and breathe marketing... he bleeds it. It's so deeply embedded inside of him.The price is ridiculous. Just buy it!Read it slowly. Read it often! You'll get it on a deeper level each time and your profits will grow accordingly.
4,Easy to read,"Sales letter can make or break a deal so if you are selling online or involved in selling process... this is a good readEven if you are thinking to start an internet business, a well written sales letter is a definite must!Fione Reveals How To Start A Million Dollar Internet Business WorkBook (Fione Tan internet marketing secrets)When i started my online business in 2000, i remembered rading this book a few years ago and still keeping in in my library... good to be read even after a few months..."
2,The Ultimate Sales Letter: Attract New Customers. Boost Your Sales,Ulitmate Sales Letter? I think not. I have been in business for 27 years and did not see any thing new or exciting in this book. So poorly written I disposed of it in the recycle bin.Amazon was great!
2,not that great ... some gems ... scattered among outdated and already heard stuff,"not that great.some gems, but you can find this stuff online for free at: [...].or just google free copywriting technique info advancedsome material was very outdatedi would not have gotten this book if i would've know it has a few gems but a lot of common stuff and lots of outdated info"
4,The Ultimate Sales Letter,"I found the book interesting, easy to read and highly informative. I am in network marketing and was specifically interested in sales letters for an informational website -- connected then to a sales site. It is flexible enough that you can use the information no matter what type of business you have. I would recommend it for management and sales people alike."
5,One of the best books on sales writing I've read,"I write copy for direct marketing and have read many books and articles on how to produce great copy. This one is the best.Kennedy goes beyond the usual examples of big-time direct marketing like subscription offers, clubs etc. and gets into a broad range of smaller scale applications for using sales letters in the mail.Kennedy also gives a great step-by-step procedure... useful for copywriters trying to stay on top of their game. I don't know if too many non-writers will get the stunning results Dan promises. There will always be a place for professional copywriters."
3,decent sales tool,"I didn't learn anything new here, however it made an excellent handout to those on my team that needed help."
2,Good for first-timers - not for those in the business,"Good stuff in this book. But not if you're a pro. This book contains basic concepts only. And even then, the concepts could be further explained if only Mr. Kennedy could have provided more examples of how to apply the concepts... then it'd be more useful.Otherwise, if you've never written a sales letter before or never picked up a Direct Marketing Book, this one is a good place to start, like a direct mail writing 101 primer class.Interesting point in the book: I never knew the envelope of a DM should be used to fool the postman into delivering your mailing instead of dumping it in the trash. Most others would say the OE has only one use, and that is to get your prospects to open and read the contents."
3,Good information but scattered explanations,"This book contains the information I was looking for, generally speaking. I make postcard mailers and was interested to find information to strengthen response rates. This book covers marketing an inch deep and a mile wide.Reading examples and explanations can be a challenge as some examples I feel aren't explained clearly before jumping to the next idea.Overall a good reference might just need to re-read."
5,Power packed book - Great for beginners to advanced,I highly recommend this book. I had gotten used to writing legal documents before starting in a sales profession. This amazing book really helped me get in the right frame of mind to write powerful copy.The text is easy to read and plush with examples and copies of real sales letters.It has helped me significantly increase the exposure for our website Autoapproved.comCan't say enough good things about it.
1,Save your money. . . .,This book is nothing but a sales pitch for their newsletter and most of the info is both sales 101 and found freely on the internet. Very disappointed!
3,"Good, but must disconnect base when replacing sensor batteries","I like the weather station, but the AAA batteries in the remote temperature/humidity sensor expired after about 3 months. When I replaced them and reset the sensor, the base station would not detect the sensor. After many efforts (including resetting the base station), I was finally able to get it to work by disconnecting the power to and removing the batteries in the base station and the restoring power to the base station"
4,Product is OK,"The product is great, good functionality.One bad news: to use the full functions with the software, you have to buy it separately."
1,WMR100NA Oregon Sceintifc USB/Sensor Problems,This unit is a headache if you want a reliable continuous data collection setup. The USB connection drops out all the time. The remote sensors check in/out all the time. For this kind of money someone should start a class action suit against this company that clearly is deceiving its customers on the capability of its product.
4,stillpoint56,I've never reviewed anything but wanted to say so far I like my OR WMR100 station. Being new to such things I really wasn't sure what to look for. The other reviews were helpful in my decision making. I wanted it to track weather and especially wind where we just moved to help with tree planting etc. My only problem is the software I downloaded worked great for 2 days and now not at all. Hard to find any answers as to what might be the problem and no real help to speak of. Since I first posted this I was able to get good help from the Weather Display software people. It was something I did when installing and reinstalling. He suggested I reinstall to a different place and it is now working fine. As far as Oregon Scientific they say they will get back to you by e-mail in 4 days and they've never responded to any e-mails. They do if you call them.
1,Cheap Chinese Junk I'D RATHER HAVE A MIGRAINE,"It took numerous tries to get all the sensors to come on at the same time. Up and down the tower many times. After a few hours one or 2 sensors would go off for an hour or more. I even moved the sensors to the same table as the console. Can't get any help from customer service. No phone support at all. I bought this one when I had one of another brand working fine but wanted the option of 4 extra sensors. I gave the other one away when this arrived. I saw Made in China on the back! That's why I bought from a company called ""Oregon Scientific""? I have read other reviews since I bought thing. Wish I would have read them before."
1,Less than satisfactory,"I bought the wmr100 weather station about 6 mos ago. It worked fine for about 3 months, and then the rain gauge stopped communicating. I called the toll free number at Oregon Research over and over and sent email after email to customer support without an answer. I finally got an answer from tech support over the phone. Turned out, they were located in Manila, Philippines, and required me to reset all the sensors and the base, over and over. Everything worked all right for a while, then the rain gauge quit again and then the anemometer. I wouldn't purchase this item again in a million years. Tech support is non-existent, and you will need it. Waste of money."
2,I wouldn't buy this,I was given this as a gift for Christmas and it was always a problem. I called their customer service dept and was put on hold for a long time. The tech was not much help he couldn't figure out the problem. I finaly got it working myself. I have to climb up on the roof to change the batteries too often. This time it just died. I will replace it with a different brand.
4,Some problems with the rain guage.,"I've had my WMR100 for 9 months. There have been some problems with the rain guage, which I've had to request replacement for twice. Both replacements were covered under warranty. Otherwise the weather station has been working fine."
3,Weatherizing,I'm not real thrilled with the controls on the actual station but its accurate and compact
1,obsolute and doea not work,"Oregon Scientific promises to release updated software for windows 7 at the end of June. In May, the website said ""at the end of May."" A month ago, it said ""in a few weeks. The software likely will never be released; don't invest in any of their products."
1,Try another manufacturer.,"When it worked, it was a great product. Let it see a little extreme weather and it dies, a little bit at a time. Ours was only a couple of months old when this happened. Oregon Scientific's customer support told us no problem, we will replace it. After 5 months, they have not sent us our replacement, nor have they responded when asked about the status of our return."
4,Easy to set up,"The weather station was easy to set up. It took about40 mins to accomplish.We have a casual interest in our local weather. No interestin the computer interface aspects of this station. If wedid want to use them, we would have to turn off User AccountControls. That would be unacceptable.The station itself provides the information we want ina reasonably convenient format. We live in central Californiawith moderate temperatures and no snow. The station performswell in this environment."
4,Great weather station,Nice weather station. It's easy to setup even with lousy instructions. I had trouble getting the rain gauge to work but resetting the unit force it to scan for all the sensors and it's been working ever since. It looks nice on my desk and seems to be very accurate. I recommend this unit.
4,Oregon Scientific Weather Station,So far this has been a good product. The wireless components and stand have made it easy to install.
3,Cool product - a little pricey,"UV index and will chill/heat index do not work. Good wireless range, self emptying rain gauge."
1,Don't bother buying this!!,The sound quality of the out going message and the incoming message are VERY POOR!!
1,Worst quality of sound ever heard,"Don't bother to go near this phone, unless you want to use this as a answering machine. Handset continously looses connection with base unit and makes wierd noises while talking.Answering machine functionality is OK. Sometimes it wouldn't even show the caller ID."
1,Worked for a year,"This phone was good for about 1 year. Now, the receiver doesn't work properly. I can hear the person on the other end, but they can't hear me. It's become an answering machine."
1,Dont Buy,"I bought this about a year ago for college and worked fine until recently. It no longer charges or will allow me to even turn the phone on to answer calls (I have tried to replace the battery and that isn't the problem). However, the answering machine still works fine."
5,Great product at a great price.,"These envelopes are great, no licking required. I wouldn't say they offer complete privacy but good enough for what I am mailing. Very handy to have."
1,Low quality,"Arrived damaged and crinkled because the box was impacted during shipment. The envelopes are VERY weak and feel fragile, like cheap paper. MEAD marks their envelopes as the same 24 weight, yet they are somehow much stronger and more resilient. These just are not professional."
2,Not so good,"These envelopes are of good quality, but do not seal well, you will need to tape the flap down for security."
1,NICKTOON'S PASSWORD HORROR,WHACK! WHO WANTS TO TYPE IN A 25 NUMBER/LETTER PASSWORD TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL (example XCXCBXG555JBRRRBV111BGB9). THIS NICKTOON RACING FOR GAMEBOY COLOR IS BEING RETURNED TO THE STORE. My 8 year old who likes (pictures or 8 letter/number or less)short passwords(like in Rocket Power)only.Unless your kids like typing in long password ... pass this one on.vl
4,great shaper,"I originally bought this shaper at Kohls some time ago, but haven't been able to locate one since in my size, except for Amazon and at a great price. I am very satisfied with this product. It doesn't ride up on my body type, is light in weight and quite comfortable, even in hot weather. I am 5'3"", around 130 pounds and looking to reduce the appearance of ""midriff bulge"". Unless you are wearing a corset, nothing is going to be 100%."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I'd give it no stars if I could. This did not do anything. Maybe it's good for bigger people who just don't want to wear a bra, but as a means of shapewear, it doesn't do it's job. I wish I hadn't listened to the reviews. Nonetheless, I am returning mine. It costs way too much to not do anything. It just seemed as though I had another shirt on."
4,very comfortable alternative to bra,"I found this to be about exactly as described. The support is minimal but enough for comfort to be worn around the house or under casual clothes. If you are a larger cup size (ie over a C max) it will probably not be enough support to feel comfortable going out, but it is a very nice alternative to a bra on lazy days. The control, shaping, aspects are mild, but it did create a smooth line as promised."
4,"Comfy, with light support","What a great way to get away from bras, though not a true replacement for the larger bust. The fabric is silky and body-hugging, but not tight. The cups provide light support, OK for around the house but I wouldn't be comfortable for a whole work day or long walk. The Nancy Ganz BodySlimmers ""What A Lift"" Seamless Cup Camisole has more support. And after seeing the ridiculous prices of some similar items, this is a real bargain."
2,Not as great as I expected,"I bought this cami based on the other reviews on 3 points: that it doesn't ride up, that it actually does slim you down, and as one reviewer had said, that it was slightly longer on the torso. Unfortunately, this cami failed on all 3 points with me. I'm 5'2"" and I'm always pulling this cami down to at least reach my lower tummy, which it rides up on constantly. While overall it IS slimming, it doesn't help on the areas it doesn't cover (what with riding up and all). It is nice, but I certainly wouldn't wear it alone as a top, and don't expect it to peek through if you intend to layer it since it is both short and lowcut. It's like a very long sports bra, and not much more."
5,SMOOTHE AND PRETTY,"I bought one and loved it so much, I ordered 3 more.Great for those who hate the bra lines on the backand don't require a lot of lift. It also looks good."
1,Doesn't Work,"I can't believe that there's no warning in the description of this product saying that it is for old computers only. I should have read all the reviews before making the mistake of ordering it. I see now that there's one from a good while back saying that it does not work on new Macs. This game should either be removed entirely from Amazon's listings, or a prominently displayed warning should accompany it."
5,Scrabble review from Australia,"ScrabbleI had no luck in finding Scrabble for Mac and had to resort to extreme measures to have it sent to me in Australia. It cost more because of postage but the service was fast and efficient.As to the game itself I have had hours of pleasure already and find it an improvement on the old game I had which would not play on Mac OX10. I especially like the dictionary and hints and the best part is that if I make a typing mistake I do not forfeit my turn.All in all I am absolutely delighted, thank you!"
1,An ok game with one massively stupid design decision,This game plays scrabble with you. The trouble is it refuses to run without the CD being in the drive. I don't want to carry a box of CDs around with my laptop. This is stupid deyound belief. Avoid this product.
2,Scrabble,This game of Scrabble game does not work with Mac Mountain Lion. I was very disappointed because I love this game.
1,Doesn't work,"We might have been sent the wrong disc, as ours is labeled Board Games Trio Disc 1, but it says Scrabble. We have Mac OS 10.6, Snow Leopard and it will not launch. We have contacted the seller and are sending it back for a refund."
1,disappointed,"I have downloaded this game onto my Mac. Called a tech to help solve the problem, as of right now, they weren't able to get it to work either. Since I had to review this item and give it at least one star, that's exactly what I did."
2,looks are deceiving,"I do my best to be a discriminating shopper, which can be a challenge when shopping on line. I love tea (especially Darjeeling), and regularly look for good quality and value. For a moment, I thought I was on to something with ""China Mist"" a quality tea at a bargain price........... but then, the devil is in the details. First, it was the elaborate review which was obviously written by a publicist of some kind, overflowing with hyperbole and product history. No big deal, but kind of annoying when it's the only review available. The clincher, though, is the shipping charges......$6.00 worth of tea with a $7.95 shipping charge. See ya."
5,"Good music, Oldies","This is the era of music I am used too. Thank you so much for the CD. I will add this to my collection. Thanks again, Beverly"
5,Awesome First Remote Control (RC) Car,"This is the best RC I've found for first-timers, or for the 3-4 year range! It has a fully functioning controller that is simple and easy to use. Use the steering wheel on the controller to turn right & left, push it forward to go forward and pull it back to backwards. It also has 2 stunt buttons that my 4-year old loves; one button makes the car flip and the other button makes it spin. Yes, it makes animal sounds too, but if it drives parents nuts, the sounds can be turned off.This RC is big; larger than any RC I've seen for toddlers and it's also built really well, so I'm not too worried that my little guy will crush it easily."
5,Every Day God,"This book is awesome. There's something in here for everyone--young or old, religious or agnostic. These sharings are beautiful, simple and to the point. It's better than Chicken Soup for the Soul!!!University of Washington student."
5,Earthy poerty with Urban Flair,"Girl by Nikki Blak is an excellent example of urban grit wrapped inside of elegant yet earthy verses. The book is akin to taking a journey through years of this poet's life and ending with the most simplistic and true realization. ""Girl"" challenges you to open your mind and look at yourself in ways that you would not normally wish to. An excellent book for young women dealing with the trials and tribulation of growing from girl to woman and for the men who feel that they can never understand what that journey is like. The urban elements of the book are described with such freshness and honesty that you truly feel that you have entered into the memories of this artist.Highly recommended read."
4,Illuminating read for travel to Kyrgyzstan,"The title of this novel unfortunately created some awkward moments when the tour leader borrowed this book and noted from the first few pages that his mother is from the village where it is set. ""An why is it called This is Not Civilization,"" he asked.The novel is divided among three different locales. The first one, Kyrgyzstan, is so engaging that I was tempted to skip the next one, set in Arizona, and pick up the thread back in the village. Not possible, given that the characters among the three settings are interwoven and integral to the ending. This was a very good read for travel to Central Asia."
1,Burn this Book,This novel is an insult to the Kyrgyz people and makes a good case for a book burning. Read anything else.
2,Rosenberg leaves the reading wanting...,"From the very sentence I was sucked into the book, my attention captured as I prepared for an exhilarting journey into unknown lands and experiences. However, after a few chapters in, I was sorely disappointed and simply finishing the book felt more like a chore than a pleasure.The attitude of the main character, Jeff, left me feeling confused and disconnected. While there are undoubtedly disappointments in providing social aid abroad, I found the main character to be callous to experiences, dwelling more on the fact that he wasn't changing the world as opposed to finding the good in what he was doing. Overall Jeff comes off as a pessimistic, disconnected human being using distance and social service to run from a trouble past of his own.The novel does bring up interesting questions and situations, but in the end the characters seem to fall flat and the reader is left wanting."
4,Good look at cultural differences,"I found this book to be interesting and compelling, but it wasn't something that totally gripped me so that I couldn't put it down. I agree with the other reviewers that the characters were very believeable and the clash of cultures is interesting. If you are interested in how peoples of different cultures interact in today's complicated world, it is a good read."
3,cliched; rings true; direct and to the point,"If you've traveled or lived overseas you will see that the author, a former Peace Corps volunteer, knows what it's like to live overseas.The book if full of cliches, which have basis in truth (as many lies do), and is direct and to the point. The author's style is straight forward third person narrative, and the story comes across almost like an allegory.The beef I had was the author is too direct, and instead of indirectly describing something, like Chekov's style, instead goes for it in a brute force manner, not unlike this review.All in all a good book, not a great book, but if you plan to travel a lot overseas or live there, it's worth a read."
5,Highly Recommended,"Rosenberg captures the emotions, sensations, dilemmas and the essence of the American who lives abroad. The characters in this book are real, the situations true. The story is gripping, and the author makes no attempt to please the reader - the characters propel the narrative forward, not the writer. I couldn't put it down."
2,Not Great,"This product is very cute and my girls love it. It is very easy to operate. However, not long after we got it the cd player stopped working. It just stops playing and then will resume. Would NOT recommend this product."
2,another poor Barbie product,"This worked for a little while, until it didn't. The CD player worked longer than the radio, which was very hard to tune. We could never get reception which was frustrating. If I held the antenna it worked fine until I let go. Grrrrr. And since the antenna telescopes, my kids LOVED to pull it up and down, so that eventually broke. I only bought this one because it was pink. Mistake!"
1,"Good radio, Terrible CD Player","I thought this was too cute, so bought it for my toddler so we could have music in her room. The CD player skips terribly, even on brand new disks with absolutely no scratches. The radio works fine, so we're just using that part. I was disappointed since I was buying it mainly to play the new CDs I had bought her. Guess we'll have to listen to them in the car."
1,CD player doesn't work,My daughter received this for x-mas. I returned due to the CD player not working. I returned it to Toys R Us and they didn't have another in stock. I then purchased it through Amazon.com and it arrived with a CD player that wouldn't work yet again. I'm going to return it and not buy another.
3,"Broken upon arrival, and CD skips...","The box was ripped and taped up, but I was hoping the radio was fine when my daughter opened it this christmas morning. It ended up being broken in the front with some plastic pieces that fell off. Cosmetic, so not a huge deal...and don't want to return (since santa brought it)Then when we play a cd it skips if touched in the slightest bit.It's super cute to look at but think it's not very good quality...bummed, but my daughter likes it."
2,Failure in Barbie Bloombox BAR201 Portable CD Boombox with AM/FM Radio,"I bought this product hoping for a good product. However, it fails when reading the CD's. Always stopping to read any CD."
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality. We bought this for our our 5 year old daughter. Within a few weeks it began losing connection all the time with the power cord. It also has problems with the volume control. Sometimes the volume will not work..we turn it all the way up and you can barely hear it. (Btw we have it out of reach of the children, so it is operated only by my husband and me. We can't blame the kids on this one.) We've been very disappointed especially considering how much we paid for it. It's really cute on the outside but it is not worth the money we spent."
2,Cute but doesn't work correctly,"I purchased this because it was cute and matched my daughters tv perfectly. Unlike everyone else the cd player seems to be fine but the volume is messed up, it changes on its own, that is if you can get it working at all. We also got the clock radio and have had the same problem with the volume. I am very disappointed that I wasted my money and they definately got me with the ""cuteness"" of it."
2,Disappointed...,"I was absolutely thrilled with how cute and how easy to use the Barbie Boombox was. My 5-year old absolutely loves it. However, like so many of the other reviewer for this product, the CD player quit working after exactly one year. My daughter mainly uses this for the CD player, so we are very disappointed in the quality of this product. Of course, the warranty expired at 90 days so we are out of luck. I will not be buying another at $59.99 only to have it happen again. Emerson, obviously this is a flaw in the product that needs to be fixed."
1,Junk,oops...should have gone for a decent player rather than a picture.Lasted three months then stopped playing and the sound quality is horrible.Buy something else!
1,Barbie BLoom Box,Barbie Bloombox BAR201 Portable CD Boombox with AM/FM RadioWhen we recieved the Bloom Box we thought we would try it out to see if it works and the CD player is broken!!!I will have a very UNHAPPY child on xmas day!!The box looked worn and maybe opened at some point. We no longer have any paper work to send it back and get a new one. So I guess we are stuck with a Barbie radio that I could have paid 10 dollars for!! Not a good experience!!
1,DO NOT BUY! Would give no stars if allowed!,I bought this thinking maybe I would be the lucky recipient of a working boombox. My daughter loved the style and that it was Barbie. It's a piece of junk - do not waste your time or MONEY! CD player worked once! So much hassle to have replaced/returned and no response from EMERSON AT ALL! It should be taken off the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Barbie/Mattel should also remove themself from the product...doesn't look good for them either!
2,Cute but didn't last long,Got this cute thing as a gift 10 months ago and used periodically and my 4 year-old was able to use it. All it did was sit on the shelf and occasionally play cds. Two days ago it stopped recognizing cds. I called Emerson Radio customer support and it would cost half-again as much to return and replace. I don't think it is worth it and won't be paying for replacement.
2,CD Player will stop working ; (,"My 7 year old received this Bloombox as a Christmas gift in December of 2008. Sadly, the CD player did stop working today (after 7 months) just as other reviewers have mentioned. The current price on Amazon is OUTRAGEOUS!! Do not pay $60+ for this CD player, it's not worth it (ours cost around $30 last Dec from Amazon). My daughter is upset because she can not listen to her favorite music in her room until we find a good replacement. Cute radio, bad quality."
3,Barbie Bloombox,"The product is an average item. The sounds quality is fine for what the device is supposed to do.It is a radio designed for a younger girl. After about age 8 girls begin to lose interest in Barbie, so don't plan on this being used for many years to come.If you want better sound quality for a more enriched listening experience, spend more money.We did have a hardware problem with this radio when we first got it. The seller replaced it with no problems."
4,"SO FAR, SO GOOD","THIS SEEMS TO WORK REALLY WELL, SO FAR. IT IS FOR MY 2 1/2 YEAR OLD GRAND DAUGHTER. SHE IS TO YOUNG TO USE IT BY HERSELF BUT LOVES TO LISTEN TO HER CD'S AND DANCE TO THE MUSIC."
3,Cute Bloombox,Cute and lightweight. A little over priced in my opinion. I expected it to be heavier and play mp3's.
3,"cute but doesn't play CD-R , RW",we love the box but it is fairly useless to us because it won't play recorded CD's and that is ALL we use with our daughter.
2,Not impressed....,"When I first got this boombox in the mail, I was thrilled. My daughter (who is 4) absolutely loved it. It's very cute and perfect size for a little one. However, within about three weeks the player just stopped playing cds. We believe there is some sort of problem with the eye. If you aren't going to use the cd player that much, I bet it would work great. But if you know you are going to use it quite a bit, I would look at something else."
1,Disappointed,This is the second CD player that I have ordered from Amazon and the second one that has arrived without a working CD player. The first one I just thought was a fluke but this one does the same thing...nothing. Its a very expensive (but cute) radio. I really NEED a CD player for my daughter...guess I will try actually going to the store to purchase it since Amazon has totally let me down (again) I really love Amazon and the ease of ordering online but I will think and think again before I order anything else online.
2,"Nice design, but failed after less than a year","Our daughter received this as a gift, and we played her bedtime CD's every night for 11 months. One day, the CD player gave up and stopped working. It's too bad.. because we had no complaints otherwise. It's a nice product if it would have just kept running. The warranty is 90 days, so we're out of luck."
1,Barbie Bloombox,"This is an awful CD player. We got the first one for our four year old and put it on top of the bookcase in her room (no one touches it but Mom and Dad). The CD player quit working after three days. The second one lasted four months, but now the CD player will not power up. I expected much better. And of course, because it's been four months, we can't return it. Save yourself the headache!"
1,i was very disapointed,i bought the pennsylvania laser charm and when i got it half the ink was scratched off the charm
4,Measure only a liter of water,"The first time we tried to work this, we couldn't get anything out. We discovered later that we must have overfilled it, since we had the steel version and there was no obvious fill line. After looking up alternative directions in English, which mentioned a fill line, we measured the water beforehand and put in only a liter. Everything worked perfectly after that. We shall see how the whole apparatus holds up."
4,"Really nice, but not all the tracks are equally good.","The CD contains some very nice music. The band is good, the sound great and the interplay with Wynton Marsalis and Roy Hargrove is superb. Unfortunately, however, not all the tracks keep up to the same level (especially those composed by Payton himself). Inspite of Payton's best efforts, the short presence of Wynton Marsalis illustrates the limits of Payton's maturity."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I bought this book based on some very positive reviews I read here on amazon.com. I regret it. Deeply. The book's approach and notation are sorely outdated and, in order to avoid rigorous arguments, the author will make u wade through a bunch of 'intuitive' arguments that should supposedly enlighten you. They honestly do not do that. They are more likely to confuse you about the ideas which you may have mastered elsewhere in more rigorous books.Famous books are famous for a reason. This book wasn't one and yet, following the few recommendations I read here, I invested both Time and money in it. Now I regret it. If there is a way for me to get my money back, I would not hesitate to go for it. Unfortunately that would probably mean I will have to sell this book to another fellow mathematician.I won't do that though. For its unethical."
5,Unique and Beautiful Presentation,"Once in a long while you get to find a gem hidden between pages of a text. Edwards offers a powerful and stunning presentation of differential forms unlike any other. I wish I could say something other than ""read it and see"", but any review I can offer will not do justice to Edwards' stunning effort. The presentation is VISUAL while honoring the rigor of sound mathematics. It's simply -- stunning.Think of it this way... Feynman is to physics as Edwards is to differential forms.Chapter eight is nothing short of artistic expression in mathematics and science. That chapter, alone, should be studied by educators and integrated into modern instruction."
4,Advanced Calculus: A Differential Forms Approach,"The differential forms approach has considerable intuitive appeal as well as capturing more useful math for the physics or engineering student than the conventional approach. Edwards is a little too much the mathematician. The text misses the mark for the typical physics or engineering student who has taken only the usual calculus sequence and needs a little more intuitive introduction and to be led into the abstraction more gently. A more geometric approach might have been useful. I would have introduced the wedge product explicitly with a geometric explanation in terms of vectors.My objective in purchasing the book was to fill in my background on the subject the easy way after pretty much figuring out what it is all about. For that the book is fine. But back in 1959 when I took advanced calculus, I think I would have found the books difficult without a good teacher to help me along. The book is probably not what I'll use for a course."
4,Great!,"I found this book to be a beautiful introduction to multivariable calculus using the language of differential forms. This is a must-have perspective on multivariable calculus. However it is very long. Over 400 pages! This book also assumes very little background, and thus it uses ugly and painstaking notation, rather than more comprehensible and easier-to-read abstract notation such as matricies, (except for the 4th and 8th chapters), etc. Still I recommend this book to anyone wanting a different perspective on multivariable calculus."
3,"OK, but a little underwhelming","It is well shaped and very easy to fit to my Lexus. It also rolls up easily when you are done with it.My only disappointment is that when in position, it kind of sags in the middle - it doesnt stay up tight against the wind shield. Not sure this affects its performance, it just looks... well... a little saggy."
1,Needs work,"I didn't like the game at all. The graphics are really choppy, and the controlls aaren't to good either. It's hard to move around the fields and go to the location you want to be. The aiming system could use some work to. If you load a joystick the controls would probably be better.by all means go ahead and buy it if you want."
2,It could have been better,control- to choppy 3.0 visuals-bareley acceptible fun-if u like paintball(7.6) if u like shooters(4.0)if u dont like either(2.67) Realisim(how paintball like)too slow (5.98)
4,Good imitation,"This is a good imitation of a real yemenite shofar, and for the price, it is worth it. It plays precise notes (C - F on this model) that are not too hard to obtain. The absence of smell is a great advantage with the synthetic model. I prefer the natural shofar's embouchure, though. It is thinner and sticks better to your lips. I disagree with Lark in the Morning's claim that it plays better than an actual animal horn. The natural horn plays a louder and more impressive sound, while this one is softer. Precise but softer.The texture and shine are also different from the real horn, but on the general outward appearance, there is very little difference."
4,awesome,awesome cha cha music. i grew up in east los angeles and some of these were the hottest songs playing in the clubs in the 80s
1,"Plagio de una buena idea, #2","Digo lo mismo de éste que lo que dije del volumen #1 con este título y publicado por la misma editorial. Usan el nombre de la magna obra de nuestra amada compatriota Conny Mendez para asignárselo a un supuesto libro del Maestro Saint Germain que, con todo respeto, el bendito Maestro no escribió.Lo que me motiva a escribir este ""review"" es que puede que mucha gente se confunda pensando que se trata del libro de Conny... CUANDO NO LO ES! (Creo que esa es la idea del editor).No suelo (ni me gusta) dar ""mala prensa"" a nada ni nadie, pero creo que buena es esta ocasión para hacer una excepción."
5,Caballe sings Strauss,"Who would have expected Montserrat Caballe, well known for her rendition of the notoriously difficult but stylistically worlds-away-from-Strauss part of Norma, to render up one of the truly great recordings of Salome? After listening to the other major recordings I just keep coming back to Caballe. There is something seductive and overwhelming about her interpretation, which comes through as powerful, stunningly beautiful, yet somehow childlike. Don't get me wrong, Caballe's singing is both rich and nuanced, but for some reason it seems more believable to me for the role than any other I have heard. I suspect this is just what Strauss wanted, for he said the part should be sung by a ""16 year old with the voice of Isolde."" Too bad this recording is out of print, because it's really first rate from top to bottom, but it's Caballe's singing which is the real draw, proving once again what a versatile singer she is. Brava Caballe!"
1,a waste of money,"This flashlight was made to specs that do not consider the size of D cell batteries. So, the batteries shake around. The poor contact mades it flicker and dim frequently"
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"Im probibly one of the biggest mafia movie fans and when i saw this movie with the tite MAFIAS GREATEST HITS i bought it thinking it was going to be ok, but it was not only a waste of 10 dollars it was a waste of my time watching it! take my advice and DONT buy this movie!"
1,the movies are terrible,"Ok, so I'm into mafia type movies, and purchased this because it was only 10 bucks. The disk brings like 3 or 4 movies. They are all very low budget and poorly made movies. Some low-budget movies can still be very entertaining if they have a good story line - but not these. The movie with Joe Pesci is semi-entertaining, but not worth the money. Another film is some really whack type of documentary on some mobster. So anyway, the point is that you should not consider purchasing this DVD if you are looking for entertainment."
5,Ultimate Ozzy,Ozzy Osbourne - Live at BudokanThis is a must have for any Ozzy fan. I have watched this DVD more than any other in my collection and still enjoy it everytime I veiw it.
4,This Is A Great Live DVD But There Should Have Been More.,"OZZY OSBOURNE'S LIVE AT Budokan is a great live DVD. The picture and sound is excellent. There should have been more on the setlist. The features are normal to me for a concert DVD. I enjoyed The Osbournes short, the weird about it was it wasn't censored. Overall this is a great concert DVD."
5,"Live at Budokan ""ROCKS""","This is one of the greatest DVD'S a person can buy , i have Live and Loud , G3's dvd , Satriani in San Francisco plus a few other great music DVD's but this is the best quality audio and visuals i have seen , excellent footage of all the band especially Zakk Wylde going off his head ,amazing a must buy for anybody who loves great ROCK AND ROLL .AAAA++++"
5,Brilliant,"Set the home theatre up , have a few beers , turn the lights off n' turn the music up . This Rocks...i was never an ozzy fan but this is brilliant , ive got motley crue dokken n' sammy hagar on dvd , but this is by far the best , the 5;1 mix is unbeleivable, the camaras angles are great , and what a great set , all it needed was miricle man n' perry mason to be perfect , but zak plays a bit of miricle man in his solo. Its worth every cent , im an ozzy fan forever , is there a better DVD?"
4,What should spect as well,"Lets go straigth to the point..... even when sounds is good, I found the scenery quite cheap and simple. I agree that Ozzy has the same nice voice or even better maybe and Zakk showed me that it was posible for a person to play Bark at the moon ""live"" It{s amazing, but always there is a but, I think I would appreciate more the concert if during edition of the DVD, they would cut the spitting views of Zakk. To be honest that views of him spitting all over and on any direction are very discusting. Not to mention the close up of him spitting on ""Mama Im coming home"" one of my favorites songs.But anyway, after all is quite good the concert."
2,Oz's Age/Poor Production Take Toll on This Project,"Alas- poor Ozzy, I knew him well.... Ozzy's performance on this DVD is lacking. His singing is uneven (losing keys often), & he looks sadly decrepit hobbling around the stage. NOT the best live versions of these songs. The band is talented, but somehow not as compelling nor engaging as on other releases/incarnations. The production is distracting- poor mixing (lacking bass in bass guitar & drums- overall quite flat tonically). The extras are interesting but the long & cheesy 80's computer graphic segues get old fast, and the inaudible audio on ""The Osbournes in Japan"" detracts from its inherent interest. When compared to the also recently recorded ""Iron maiden: Rock in Rio""- the performance & production are just not up to par!"
2,I can't hear you!!!!!!!!!!,"Here's how awesome this DVD is. I'm still watching the end of it and reviewing it at the same time.This is a snoozer not because of Ozzy or his very accomplished back up band, but because he actually has to convince the crowd that they want an encore. This is the lamest crowd I have ever seen and it really affects the whole feeling of the show.No emotion, and so quiet you could hear a pin drop if it weren't for the band and Ozzy who has to tell the crowd ""I can't hear you""!! after every single song, during the songs, and as he's shuffling off stage at the end. Pathetic. I have been a sabbath fan and an Ozzy fan since I was 12 years old. Have seen 5 Sabbath concerts and two of Ozzy's shows and this was just plain sad.Not worth watching let alone buying this DVD."
3,Not as good as it should be,Both the performances and the DVD let this down. Oz fans should get Live & Loud instead.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys
5,awsome,"if u are an ozzy or zakk fan,, or even if u just like great talent.. this one is a must.. one of the best dvd's out there.. far as live performance's goes,, kudos to all band members. Zakk is one of the best as is Ozzy.."
5,Ron Dante Produces Rockin'Christmas Party !,Ron Dante does a great job producing this CD.His songs are wonderful too!Rock and Roll Christmas and Santa Claus Is Coming To Town are the rockin' ones.Shine Your Light On Me and The Christmas Of Our Lives glow with the feel of the Holiday Season.Ron Dante just gets better and better with time.Lou Chritie comes off best of the other rockers on this CD.
3,Busted disc,The music selection is good but even after I returned the first cracked disc the replacement disc was also cracked. But the second one at least played in the computer. I do have to wonder about the quality of production with two in a row being cracked.
1,Great looking and feeling phone with one draw back.,"Great looking and feeling phone with one draw back.YOU CAN'T HERE ANYONE, THE EAR VOLUME IS AWFUL EVEN AT MAXIMUM.I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S SO LOW."
3,It's a cordless phone. It was cheap.,"Works fine in the house, can't talk in the yard. Cheap at half the price. Got a Panasonic that has much better range!"
3,Mostly made of plastic,"I have a ""63"" Bug and was trying to make this fit. This mirror is mostly made of plastic and once installed does not move much. I have had it on my Bug for about 6 months and I am surprised to say this mirror is really durable."
4,Quality product,"I received and assembled these yesterday. To my surprise, the package contained 2 stands even though the technical details on the Amazon site states 'Item Quantity 1'. There should be proper information to let you know there are 2 sent for each order!Nevertheless, after the easy assembly I can say this is truly a quality product and I would highly recommend them. They are holding my monster Klipsch RS-3 surround speakers and they are more than adequate for this purpose, and look great!"
5,Don't own it but I've just seen it,"This movie was part of the Savannah Film Festival and I had a chance to see it. It was wonderful. This movie addresses a real issue and shows realistic reactions people could have. It's not for kids though, there is sexual content, nudity, and language. I'm not a film major but I went with many people who are and they enjoyed it as well. Jon Bernthal's character was awesome."
2,"Broke my heart, but definately deserves it's 5-cent price",This movie is really sad and very realistic if the given circumstances were reality. But I honestly did not enjoy this movie. I purchased it because it was so cheap. The only reason I even know about this movie and purchased it was because Elijah Wood is my favorite actor. But Elijah's character in this movie is really messed up so I didn't win from any perspective. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,very odd,This is an odd compilation. The producers didn't seem to know much about their product. Stan Kenton's singer in 'Tampico' is June Christy. The band in the second half of the album is Gene Krupa's. The singer in 'Deep in the Blues' is Irene Daye. The best thing about this album is its cover collage.
2,"Product is probably ok, haven't even installed it yet, looks hand made.","Product looks ok for quality ( haven't tested it yet ) but the plate sides are not straight, it looks as it is hand made, I ordered 2 pieces and they differ from each other too! I was about to start carving a hole for this thing but it will not be nice and straight, so I decided to order a different product."
1,Good When It Works,Works fine when it is working. Mine is now broke for the 3rd time in 6 months. The on off switch keeps going bad. This Vac gets very light use around the house and in the cars. The original bag is not half full yet. The first time it quit the store replaced the Vac. The second time SHOPVAC Corp sent a new motor assembly which you have to install with a special star drive bit. You cannot replace just the switch assembly. They expect you to pay shipping back but demand a free pickup and shipping label. I emailed them about this third dead switch 2 weeks ago and have not heard back from them yet. Always trusted ShopVac but will never buy another.
2,Disappointed in the new shopvac,"I had an old shopvac that was very noisy but worked great. After many years, I decided to upgrade, sold it to a friend cheap, and went out to buy the latest and greatest from shopvac.While the new shopvac is much quieter, the suction is nowhere as powerful as my old one (which had comparable horsepower rating). I wish shopvac would publish more useful ratings like CFMs. The new design is flawed in a few areas. The top locks on with only two latches which don't hold well enough when the vacuum is full of heavy liquid. The tool caddy is poorly designed.Overall, I wish I had my old shopvac back. I will probably look to a different manufacturer next time."
3,"Strong, but also big and heavy","Be warned that this shop-vac is large. I live in a New York City townhouse, and find that it is too unwieldy to carry up and down the stairs. I was happy to have its large capacity when our basement flooded during a rain storm; BUT when it was filled with water, it was too heavy to take anywhere to empty out! (My kids scooped out the water from the tank into buckets, and we ran up and down the stairs that way, like the sorcerer's apprentice!) It's got good suction and is definitely a powerful machine, but is much too much for smaller spaces or where you need to carry it around."
5,High quality and visibility,"This manual scorekeeper is of very high quality and surprisingly, far exceeded my expectations. In contrast to other products, the numbers are large enough to be highly visible for our girls lacrosse games."
4,Good Product,"This is a very nice, quality portable scoreboard and was perfect for what I was needing for my 5th grade basketball team."
4,"A thin book, but great for food vocabulary!","Very handy to carry around, and filled with obscure (but useful) vocabulary to aid in translating menus."
2,AutoCAD VBA Programming Tools and Techniques : Exploiting th,"This book is certainly not for people new to VBA, even though the introduction leads one to believe that is covers the ""basics"" The second chapter begins with sample program and once the reader finishes that chapter, the authors assume they have taught just about all there is to know about how VBA works. I was hoping the CD would pull me out but it would not open on either win 2000 or win 98+. I learned AutoLISP out of a book in about two weeks and use it regularly but learning VBA from this book is next to impossible"
2,We can get not much help on this book,We can't find no much help on this book. The Cd rom that came with the book was blank and I had to download the examples files on the internet.
3,Almost there,"In theory the iflex is a really great idea and it almost pulls it off. However, its not quite rigid enough to support the weight of the iSight, and it tends to fall to one side or the other. In the end you can get it to stay up ok, but it takes some experimentation to find the right position."
4,Flex or not to Flex?,"This accessory, to pre built-in iSight Mac's, is not great but nice as a iSight webcam stand! It lacks stable attachability to the firewire port on computer, it wiggles far too much when plugged in. It should have included a small but effective stability clip on piece at point of contact port ( I'll try to create one for my device! ), but these iFlex units are nolonger being manufactured along with the one with a heavy base stand, which I've read tend to disconnect at wire & base junction! I'll be acquiring one shortly and hope for the best in its ability to stay attached! ""Amen Peeps"""
3,MST3K without the funny robots.,"If you're into cheezy low-budget SF movies, this is the collection for you, four movies for ten bucks. Here's a brief synopsis of the movies:Slipstream: A post-apocalyptic movie about an android wanted for murder on the run from the law. Probably the strongest of the four movies. Mark Hamill plays a bounty hunter, and Ben Kingsly and F. Murray Abraham have cameo appearances.Abraxas: Jesse Ventura plays galactic cop Abraxas trying to stop bad-guy Secundus from getting the anti-life equation and destroying the world, and at the same time save the life of an innocent woman and her child caught up in Secundus's scheme.Creature: Reminiscent of Alien, a crew of NTI, an American company fight against an alien creature on Saturn's moon of Titan.Laser Mission: Spy movie starring Brandon Lee as he tries to rescue a scientist from an evil Russian trying to create a super-laser weapon."
3,Ok but cheap,"It's not a bad vac. Great for carry around. The wheels will not stay on, so it's good you can carry it.It's not made as well, IMO as other models of shop-vacs; everything is much cheaper made and probably won't last as long as my previous ones.The hose tends to clog up easily, but there is good suction. All in all it's a good little vacuum for spot jobs.Update: June 2010.The vac is still working fine. The only problem is the hose does get clogged easily."
4,I'm Enjoying The Little Old Man,"For some reason my unit arrived without the wheels to roll it about.But I don't care.It is a wondrous sucking machine that cleans up my home construction debris with ease. After a quick phone call to the manufacturer, the wheels (casters) arrived; but I never installed them: I still haul it about by its hose and suck up all undesirables and still call it the Little Old Man With No Legs."
2,PLAIN OLE VACUUM CLEANER NOTHIN SPECIAL,EXTENSIONS ARE THE ONLY BIG DEAL IT FEELS GOOD TO VACCUUM WHILE LAYING DOWN OTHER THAN THAT SAME OLD STORY
3,It ain't all that,"This vacuum is okay for light duty pickup, I am not impressed with it at all as they usually put out a good product. I was very surprised that amazon is about $30 higher than Wal Mart. I don't normally shop there but I went with a friend & just decided to check out what they had, there it was same thing just so much cheaper. Amazon is definately price gouging on this product, Goes back to let the buyer beware."
5,Looked everywhere,"I knew there had to be a small, reasonably priced vacuum that used filter bags, but was exhausted searching for it at many different kinds of stores. I wasn't an Amazon shopper, but desperate. It popped up at the top of the list!The only drawback is lifting the top (with motor) up to get inside, but average strength will do it.The hose screws on and locks the bag in place. WetDry was just an added bonus. The cord is very long and the vacuum rolls around easily.I have been very happy with this vacuum (and Amazon) for years now."
3,shop vac,"I bought this shop vac because I had a wet basement from flooding in the area I live. It has good suction but not advertised factfully. It states it has a 2 gal. tank but it only sucks up about 2 qts. of liquid. I e-mailed where I purchased it from and was told that when the top was put on it took up much of the capacity. If you need to remove alot of water, I would suggest you buy a very large shop vac."
4,A lot of suck in a little tiny package!,"Nice little vacuum, gets the job done and doesnt complain.The couple problems are it sometimes feels flimsy and the on/off button is a pain (i just plug it in leave it on)"
2,"""Too Typical""","Very disappointed. This book was too typical. The book had it's funny moments and surprise turnouts here and there, but for the most part, it was very predictable and left much to be desired.May sound petty but the cover design on this book also left alot to be desired! Makes the book look like ""garbage"" literature before you even open it.Baisden is definitely talented - I love to hear him speak - but this book is definitely not his best work and pales in comparison to MCITD and NSWMC (I'm reading NSWMC now and it is both hilarious and sadly realistic - a fun read)!"
2,Save your money,"I read three books a week. One to stimulate my mind and the others for enjoyment.This book did neither. It was one of the worst attempts of being hip that I have ever experienced. And if another author refers to Atlanta as Hotlanta, I think I will scream.The author gave the gigolo more honor and dignity than the minister. Don't get me wrong, there are ministers that don't deserve honor, but come on. . .Try again my brother - realism really works (even in Atlanta)!"
4,Came through after all the hipe,"I had to check this book out after hearing Michael Baisden on the radio in Atlanta. This book was very entertaining, fun, easy to read, and excellent for black relationship conversations. You will have tons to talk about with your friends about the characters in this book. The ending was a little predicable to me, but I enjoyed the ride to the end. Most of the reviewers are right on with there comments. That this is a fun book to read but not the very best out there. I am sure Michael Baisden next book will be even better as he grows as a writer."
4,A definite Read!,This book was definitely a page turner. I completed the book in one weekend. I enjoyed the contemporary writing style and I could relate to the characters. The book was a little predictable but it was a great book to read. I am on the next one.
1,The Real Mainentance Needed Was on the Manuscript,"I read ""The Maintenance Man"" after being told by a co-worker that the characters and story were interesting. I really felt cheated by The End. As a writer myself, this book reads like a clumsy first draft never rewritten -- even the editing is bad, with typos and bad grammar throughout. The characters are unlikeable, one-dimensional, and play true to stereotype, and the ""love story"" is never heartfelt it's never really explored or developed. Some of the sex scenes border on the soft-core porn side, and Baisden doesn't seem to care too much for women, as his female characters come off as either airheads or promiscuous. A badly-written novel not worthy of your time when so much more and better Black literature exists..."
5,i would not change a thing,"the book was really fun to read, it shows how some of us act, try to act and are acting today. we can learn from some of micheals work and we can grow . but read the book it was a good read and beleive it or not, i did learn something new.i'd really like to hear feed back from the author himself, my mother is a baisden and with such a unual last name, i wonder if he is re-lated too my mother, well enought said'' keep up the good work god bless.... jackie"
2,I kept reading only because I spent my money on this book,This book was so predictable. Everything that happened I was obvious. Men Cry in the Dark was much better. This book read as if it were written by a high schooler trying to be deep and failing miserably. I do not recommend it.
4,He Did It Again...,"With the exception of the grammer errors, Mr. Baisden's recent release was entertaining. It was nice to see that a brother who mastered the game of HOism finally grew up and got a clue and took the second chance instead of allowing himself to miss the opportunity. Ladies, men can only be dogs if we feed into the madness and buy into the LEASHism!"
5,"When I write the dissertation, come to my defense!","I must say like everyone else...I read this book in 6 hours! Once you get started reading a book by Michael, you just can't stop. As a Black male, I'm glad to see a brother who writes using mainly male characters (in a positive light...Men Cry). However, The Maintainence Man, I must say, touched on some stuff I would have never thought would come out in fiction for a while. I'm glad it came out and maybe it will make some people think (especially married people). Once again, Mike, keep up the good work and like I said, I'll be looking you up when I write my dissertation (or my novel) whichever comes first."
2,What's the big deal?,"I am still trying to figure out what's so great about this so-called author and his so-called novels. All 3 of his works are so poorly written and developed that I have no desire to finish them. Thank God I borrowed his books and did not spent money on them.I am really stunned at the females who provide financial and moral support this unmarried, middle-aged man. I lived in Chicago for some time and all of Baisden's talk on tv, radio and his books sound like the demasculated stuttering of bitter, drunk, disillusioned brothers who loitered the street corners of Chicago's southside during the 1970's.I wish the author success -- not in writing and talk shows, but to overcome whatever his inner demons are. Also, I pray that these female readers who give Baisden anything more than 3 stars on his writing are also on the road to recovery, too."
2,Horrible,"I got this book when it first came out. The title grabbed me and since I ama fan of Michael I knew I was in for a good read. WRONG!!This story was poor, the characters were unrealistic and in the end I found it to be a waste of money.The book was returned."
5,MY FIRST BUT CERTAINLY NOT MY LAST,THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK THAT I HAVE READ BY MICHAEL BAISDEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU IT WILL NOT BE MY LAST. I FOUND IT HARD TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. I FELT LIKE I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WE KNOW.I WAS CAPTIVATED BY THE CHARACTERS AND IT WAS EASY TO FOLLOW THEIR STORYLINES. I HEARD MICHAEL ON LOCAL RADIO AND WAS INTRIGUED. I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK AND I AM SO GLAD I DID.
1,2nd review of a baisden book,"this book was terrible. he needed to develop the characters a little more, Malcolms character especially. Mr. baiden needs to take a couple more writing classes because this book was written horribly. the drama in this book was real, but some of the characters were a little confusing. Ariel claims to be professional but she was flirting with the manager from day one. I didnt even finish this book because it kind of dragged on and got boring."
3,"Quick page turner, but elementary writing...","What a great story you'll find in this book. It's particularly good for quick summer reads which are sometimes a wonderful blessing and break from the grind of our day to day lives. The only problem I had with the book is that the writing was somewhat elementary and the dialogue was oftentimes too scripted and somewhat unrealistic. Otherwise, want mind-numbing, but intriguing reading? Wonderful book!"
3,"Enjoyable, and a fast read, but..","I enjoyed MEN CRY IN THE DARK much more. It just seems this book was floundering with no real deep storyline. It seems as if each person's story could have been told in a short story and the book could have just been 4 short stories. The characters overlapped but they were so loosely tied together, they could have been sucessful in their own story.Just as in Men Cry In the Dark. You just know there is a man out there just like the ones he describes just like there are women out there like he describes, and there is no need to be mad cause, HE AIN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU UNLESS ITS YOU."
5,Outstanding !,"Totally outstanding and easy reading. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, one of the best book I've read this year. I felt as if I knew the characters in the book, and I really admire the author's writing which was smooth and to the point. This book was good and I highly recommend it to everyone to read. Outstanding !"
3,"Easy read, funny, predictable","I enjoyed the maintenance man, it was an easy read but not a page turner. I thought the book was fairly predicatable. The ending wasn't what I had expected but everyone could stand to be forgiven. I liked the close relationships between the brothers in the book. I enjoyed Men Cry in The Dark much better although I did enjoy the Maintenance Man. The dialogue was very real but couldn't you have toned it down a little bit. Good book would definitely recommend. Waiting for the next one. Keep up the good work!"
3,It's better to know the truth,"Very interesting book, although I knew by the title that the book would not really hold my attention. The character in the book, Malcolm, was a true hustler who should have got more than what he acquired in the end. Although, this book is my second purchase by Michael Baisden, I am not surprised that the book was very confusing and just showed how a true player got his in the end."
4,Getting on my nerves kinda-man,"I must say that I really enjoyed this book. I was scared that I wouldn't because I really didn't care that much for Men Cry in the Dark, but I am a fan of Michael Baisden (every since his appearance on BET). I happen to agree with a lot of things that he says and writes about. In this book, I thought Malcolm was a jerk. Antoinette was way to good for him. Malcolm just thought that he was so much better than everyone else. And Toni was more down to earth. To me, that was a couple from hell. He did not deserve her;she was so much better than him. I thought the characters were funny. I really disliked Teddy; he wore my nerves, too. People like him are the reason that women call men ""dogs"". He was a DOG from beginning to end. He felt like he was immortal and nothing could touch him, but boy was he wrong. I think this book was really good, and I can't wait till the next one. Keep doing your thang Mr. Baisden!"
4,A page turner,"I truly enjoyed this book, read it in one sitting. Michael Baidsen is a truly talented man."
4,Funny Story With Cast of Characters,"""Maintenance Man"" is one of those books whose release I eagerly awaited. Now that the wait is over, I can say it was definitely worth it. At first I wasn't sure if I were going to like this book, but after completing it I can say the following (1) Light Fare (2) Easy Reading (3) Funny, Hilarious Scenes and Dialogue (4) A couple of twists and (5) Seemed like I was watching a parody or some other kind of film. If you're looking for a deep, DEEP book, keep looking; but if you want a light, easy and entertaining face paced read, go pick up a copy of ""Maintenance Man"". Good job, Mike Baisden."
1,Sucks.,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It was stereotypical, simplistic and predictable. I didn't think it was possible for a book to be this bad.My favorite part? *note sarcasm* When a girl in the book (one of the main characters...it's been awhile since I last read it) was looking at herself in the mirror before she went out. She danced in front of the mirror, slapping herself on her hips while singing, ""You go girl!"" Blech.If you'd like to read a book to make fun of with your friends, then this one would be for you. If you have an iota of intelligence, then leave this book at the bookstore."
4,Strictly Made For Entertainment,"This book had twists and turns from beginning to end. It has typical characters within this novel in which I come across everyday in life, but it was nice to know that it is not only me who comes across these type of people. It also depicts how some women put it up with a no good man and will settle for second best. Hopefully this book will open up some womens eyes and see how low down men as well as women can be."
2,Almost Perfect For an Inexperienced Teen Reader,"My 16 year old found out about ""Maintenance Man"" and asked me to get it for her. In her opinion it was a good book, so I decided to read it. I'm an avid reader and I love a good story. The first thing I thought was that at this point Mr. Baisden is not a Pulitzer award-winning author, but the plot of his story was interesting. There were a lot of grammatical and spelling errors in his book that should have never passed his editor and proofreaders. Character development could have been improved. Mr. Baisden doesn't even begin to skim the surface of the world of a male esort (aka gigolo) and he had room to go a lot deeper with his lead character. Mr. Baisden's depiction of women was rather harsh and unsympathetic in my opinion. I think Mr. Baisden should take some constructive criticism, reflect on his motive for wanting to write and who his target audience might be, what they want, and then improve his style and skill."
3,good story,this was a good story but it was to short and not detailed enough. seem like mike was in a hurry. take yoour time mike
4,memorable read,This book is one that I was skeptical about at first. The reason was a friend recommended the book to me. Once you start to read the book you'll like it. The plot is one that picks up from page one. The author has a way of writing the plot which graps and keeps your attention from beginning to end.
5,A very interesteing book,This book was very interesting. It really gave me something to think about. Baisden's realness and was refreshing. I am looking forward to reading more of hiw work.
5,The bomb!,This book was the best thing i've read in a long while. It was excelently written. I am looking forward to reading more of Michaels' books in the days to come! Wouldnt I like to find me a maintenance man! :) :)
2,Not great,"Although I'd already read ""Men Cry in the Dark"" andwas plenty disappointed, I like to support... authors... The authorwas there participating on a literary panel with Omar Tyree and one other author whose name I can't remember. Michael Baisden is charismatic and an engaging public speaker, but his fiction leaves much to be desired.Baisden has an interesting perspective, but his character development is flat, and the dialogue seems rather fake and trite. There is not one single person to like in this book. Malcolm is a gigolo, Simon is a wimp, Ariel is neurotic and desperate, and Teddy is utterly despicable. Toni is fairly decent, but she's not a major character.Also, I find it completely unlikely that Malcolm was able to keep his cover for so long. As long as he'd been tricking, it seems like more folks would have known."
4,I highly recommend,Good book. Interesting story with wonderful detail. My first book that I've read written by a brotha'. Will make this a trend.
5,"GIG-OLO, GIG, GIG-OLO","Michael Baisden is back at it again. I have to be honest and say that I didn't quite like Men Cry in the Dark. I almost let the dislike for that book tarnish my view of Baisden as an author.I am very happy to say that I truly enjoyed this book. Late at night I had a hard time putting the book down.The book is about Malcom, a 37 year old man that is a professional gigolo. At first he loves the attention from the women and doesn't care about sleeping with rich women to pay his bills. Finally Malcom meets Ms. Right and his whole attitude and view on being a gigolo changes.The book keeps you hungry for more because of the wild characters and the everlasting DRAMA. This is a great book to read if you like DRAMA and sexy characters.:)"
3,GOOD BOOK,"THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK. THE BOOK IS ABOUT A MAN WHO SLEEPS WITH WOMAN FOR MONEY, UNTIL HE MEETS A WOMAN WHO CAN CHANGE HIS LIFE OR SO HE THINKS THERE IS ALOT OF DRAMA IN THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK WAS AN EASY READ."
5,Great Reading,"I enjoyed this book throughly and I would recommend it to anyone. The characters were in this book were very interesting and there were some characters at times you hated and then at other times felt a great about of sympathy for such as Malcolm, Cynthia, Ariel and Simon. However, I will give nothing a way all I can say is read the book for yourself."
1,WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE CONFISCATE HIS WORD PROCESSOR?,I kept looking for a plot but could not find it. Why does he keep cranking out these losers from his freshman creative writing class?
2,When Will The Madness End?,"Reading this book was like watching a terribly made BET movie. There was nothing positive about this story. After hearing much hype about this new author, I was curious. Too bad my curiosity got the best of me because I did not enjoy reading it. The dialogue was okay, but the story itself was stiff. I can understand writing about immorality, but at least give the readers the outcome of such a scandalous behavior and not just entertainment. There is only one male author worth reading his work when it comes to today's modern AA novels and that author's name is R.M. Johnson. He writes with entertainment and resolution. I'll have to give a review on his novels. Check out some of his work, you'll enjoy them."
2,Not what I expected,I bought this book only because of all the good things I've heard about it! Listen........Don't BUY it. Borrow it. There are way too many characters and it's hard to keep up with everyone.
5,A fantastic weekend read .,This was a good well rounded read for any lady who wants to read a story with lots of drama ! I am going to read this a second time around . I'm not going to reveal anything in the book but let me say that I was glued to the book the entire weekend .
5,Unbelievable!!!,I'm not one to read books but when a guy friend of mine preseented me with this one i had to go ahead. This book sat on my shelf for 1 month before I finally picked it up. It was wonderful!!! I read the entire thing in one day. What a thing for someone who dislikes reading!! I can't wait to buy his other books!!
5,Great book Easy read,I am a HUGE fan of Micheal Baisden and have been sittin' on this book for a yr. I recently was stuck at an airport for 3 hrs b/c my flight was delayed. I finished 1/2 the book while I was waiting. There are a few grammar mistakes in it!! LOL But a great book for all women to read. VERY EDUCATIONAL. M.B. doesn't sugarcoat nada!!
3,Play Better than Book...Wow,"Well I found this play at Walmart and bought it because I heard great things about it. So I watched the play and was amazed, probably the best black play I've seen. So I went back and bought the book to read it and for the first time ever I felt that the play was better than the book. usually when it comes to book they are always better than the play/movie that is made about it (color purple, memoirs of a geisha, twilight). However in this case it's the other way around.Don't get me wrong the book was ok, it just wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be."
2,Quick read but still a waste of time,"Full of name-dropping, advertising, vulgar language, misguided definitions of being a gentleman, and how relationships and friendships work. Sensationalistic and predictable. An obvious attempt to write a book that would ""SELL"". (Yeah it's going to be a movie. Let's hope it will be better than the book.) MY ADVICE....SKIP IT!!!"
4,A Real Good Book!,I really enjoyed reading this book. I read it in about 3 days. In my opinion it is a quick read. The chapters are short but to the point. The story is a lesson to be learned. Thanks Michael for showing females what really goes through a man's head! I was a little disappointed at Ariel ending but satisfied with the ending altogether. I don't feel like I was left hanging.
5,Facing reality,"This book was a ""page-turner"". I started on Monday evening(last night) and was up until 1:30 a.m.You will definitely find it eye and imagination-pleasing. Especially, when he describes the local area (I can truly relate), the smooth ""stepping tunes"" and the dusties from the past - talk about mind-blowing."
5,"""Some Can't Put Down Reading""",Mr.Baisden is truly gifted. This is a wonderfully written piece of work. I read it in a day. It grabbed my attention and held it as I am sure it will do yours. I give it an A+.
4,Very entertaining,"I, as well as others, read this book in one day. I found it interesting as well as comical. I was not satisfied with the ending, it seem to have been rushed into. Otherwise, I highly recommend it."
4,An enjoyable and interesting book,"I really enjoyed this book, this is the first book I have read by this author and I have to hand it to him. It really had me after the first page and that is hard to do. It is a must-read especially for black men, so ladies if your man doesn't read try this to break him in. Trust me read it first and you will see that your man probably has a lot in common with the characters."
4,Excellent!,"This was the first Baisden book I have read and it was GREAT! I actually stayed up way past my bedtime to finish it. The characters were very real and compelling. I could feel their pain and emotions.Mr. Baisden does an excellent job of capturing the commonalities that unite us all. He writes eloquently, yet with real sincerity.I hope he writes a new book soon. I'm going to read his other books right away.Congrats to Mr. Baisden, a self-made success!"
1,Plleeaassee,This book is full of egocentric characters that seem to reflect the authors opinion of himself. I agree with the person below who stated that this is simply bad writing and filled with misspelled words and words used incorrectly. There are too many good books out there worthy of your time. I couldn't finish it--next.
3,Languid and Predictable,"It's rare that I complain about these kinds of things because I'm not one for lengthy descriptions, but I do expect the author to initially set up the atmosphere for me, and lead me a little in character development. Environmental descriptions are important, and 'The Maintenance Man' failed to electrify me because the characters simply plane hopped to Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Chicago. There were no indepth descriptions; ie. street names, atmospheric descriptions, or people descriptions. I really couldn't invoke fundamental character traits because the characters lacked depth, and were too defined by their actions. Also, the story line is a rendention of 'Cheaters' without the lovely details and descriptions. Baisden tells an interesting story, but the novel needs more enriched & developed characters, poignant descriptions, and twists to the tale. I did, however, enjoy 'Men Cry In The Dark'. :-)"
2,Broken Beyond Repair,"I've read a couple of Mr. Baisden's books and they're okay. This one falls into the same category with me. He claims to want to help heal relationships when in actuality, I can see the open wounds in the author himself. Vulnerability is good in a good writer. It helps readers understand the characters as well as the writer. Mr. Baisden is failing in this area. You can almost hear the excuses he gives just before he portrays his female characters as desperate, easy, gullible, needy, nagging, suspicious and a plethora of other unflattering characteristics which seems to be a theme of his. Rather than make a statement for my review, I have a question. If the main character had been a woman, wouldn't she be called ""The [prostitute]?"""
3,"Cute and entertaining, but shallow....","This book was fast-paced and entertaining. If you are looking for something funny and quick to read on a lazy Saturday afternoon, this book is it. At times, it is quite funny, but that is what makes this book a disturbing read at times. The main character, Malcolm, for all his supposed musical talent, is just another man looking to breeze through life by using women and calling it his ""career"". Even when Malcolm's secret is uncovered to Antoinette, he still doesn't completely atone for being a male prostitute.As far as the plot goes, I'd give the book an ""8"". As far as character development, a ""5"" (Ariel, Cheryl, and all other women are TOTALLY undeveloped characters), and literary value, a ""2""... grammatical errors abound. (Sometimes you are even unsure as to who is talking because the book jumps abruptly in voice).In other words, if you want to read it, borrow it, don't buy it."
3,Great to see a brother write,"Writing is personal. The fact that this brother puts his thoughts and ideas out there is commendable. I hope he takes all the reviews and uses them for improvement. There are grammatical and spelling errors. However for us business/career women who need a little something to clear your mind without being grossed out by overplayed sex, it's a good book(and we are intelligent enough to get over this). To the folks critiquing the readers, the mirror is a wonderful thing."
3,book,had to read it for class and it was a great book i did not think i would like it but turns out i couldnt put it down!
5,Best book on CP,"I use this in class (along w/ Banner) and it really hits home. While his arguments are controversial, they are grounded in data."
5,WARNING!!!,"This is one of the greatest PC adventure games ever released. It has a strong mix of puzzles, humor and moving storyline that have made it a classic. While point-and-click fanatics may not like the fact that movement is accomplished by using the arrow keys instead of the mouse, it is well worth your time to familiarize yourself with the controls, as the gameplay is unparalleled adventure game fun. HOWEVER...DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME FROM MOST OF THOSE SELLERS OFFERING ""NEW"" COPIES HERE AT AMAZON!!!You will find the jewel-case (no box) release of this game advertised new and factory sealed for from $22-50 by Amazon retailers. You can purchase this same version of Grim Fandango directly from the publisher (LucasArts) for a mere $15. Don't let yourself get ripped off in your excitement to purchase this classic game!"
5,"Great Fun! Film Noir, Snappy dialog and good puzzles","What a treat this was to play! If you want to test your brain, enjoy wonderful music and graphics, you'll love this. Definetly not for the ""Hack and Slash"" minded.There's an update you can download from Lucasarts if you have a fast computer (it tends to crash with fast systems)Enjoy the ride! Manny Calaveras is a great character to play."
2,Not for me.,"I purchased this game after reading a recent article about the best games of the 90's. This may have been a great game then, but it doesn't stand the test of time. It may be fun for those who played the game when it originally was released, but it has little value for new gamers."
2,WARNING TO WINDOWS MILLENIUM USERS!,"I just received my Grim Fandango from Amazon.com. Silly me--I read the review of the person who bought it, had to get the patch from Microsoft, and had a great time with the game thereafter. That person was using Word 2000--there is no patch for Millenium. I have an unopened game that is of no use to me. I downrated the game because the maker, LucasArts, apparently does not endeavor to assist its customers with the means by which to play their software. The constant media changes that result in a more accelerated obsolescence than anyone in the 1950's ever imagined means that nothing fits, everything has to be replaced and the buyer had better beware. A real disappointment!"
2,"Sorry, I just don't get it","Yes, it looks great, but MY GOD, what a convoluted and complicated storyline! I quit after I heard the ridiculously-long list of things I had to do to get on the boat! As soon as I ran away, I completely forgot what I was supposed to be doing, and then realized...I DIDN'T CARE.I didn't think Monkey Island was that great either, though, so take that into consideration. And ANYONE who says they can do these type of games in one day or without a walkthrough IS LYING."
1,stupid puzzles. need game guide to solve,"The grpahics and story are OK. But, the puzzles areso stupid, I regret purchasing this game. Luckily,it only cost 10 bucks. I will finsh this game byfollowing the game guides found online (without wastingmy time trying to figure them out) just so I can see whathappens in the story. For example, at one point, you haveto get some bones and throw them into a tar pit so thatthese flaming rodents will jump in after them. I figuredthis out on my own. However, what I didn't figure out was thatI had to do this over and over again until all the rodents weredestroyed (a total of 4 times). I had to read the game guide tofind out I didn't do it enough times. There are even worseexamples of mindless stupidity, but harder to explain here.I was very disappointed after reading the other reviewshere and anticipating some fun puzzles that are integratedinto the story. Bottom line- in my opinion, not worth the10 bucks."
5,Best Computer Adventure Ever Written,"I loved this game; it plays like a movie. I played it with my wife for hours across many months and we both loved it. I honestly have to say that it is probably the best computer adventure ever written. I love Tim Schaeffer's other works too, but this one stands out."
5,Already a classic.,"Any adventure gamer worth his or her salt cannot be without Grim Fandango. The concept is so fresh and original, you won't be able to keep your mind off it. Be prepared to lose a lot of sleep over Manny Calavera and his world."
4,Grim Fandango is the best pc game I ever played.,"It's charming, funny, smart, clever, interesting, beautiful, intellegent and really really fun. I love this game!"
4,A different kind of game,"I like these kinds of games. Unfortunately I got stuck and got fed up and bored. Maybe if I had tried harder, I would have had more fun with it. But I really liked the look, animation and feel of it."
5,This game saved the adventure genre!!!,"Grim Fandango is awesome!!! If you like a game with a cinematic theme to it and great characters and plot, you'll most likely agree with my number of stars for this game. I loved the film noir section of the game, it really was well wrote. The controls were very good and it had graphics to match the great gameplay. If you are looking for a great gaming experience, buy this game!!!"
2,It was great while it lasted!,"Really not much to say about this item. It was great, worked well, was very quiet, pets loved it. Then one day it just stopped working. Had it less than 6 months."
3,"Ok, but could be better","I bought this for our St. Bernard who loves running water. He drops a lot of food, etc. in his water. I was hoping that this fountain would filter it out. Unfortunately, it doesn't. I have to refill it every other day and when I do, I have to clean the entire thing or it starts smelling bad. It is a pain to carry, clean and refill it that often. He does enjoy having the water flowing, though and it is one of the few that I found that was actually big enough for him."
1,Not for sloppy dogs!,I bought the drink well fountain on the recommendation of a few friends who already own the product. They said it worked well and that the filter was great. That has not been my experience. The water is gross after 8 hours. I may have the sloppiest dog on earth but I expected the motor to be able to suck up the food crumbs and hair he leaves in the bowl. It does get some of the food but the stuff left in the main bowl must be washed out every day. It was easier to wash the mop bucket we used previously so I'm switching back. The water fountain is also loud; loud enough that I must unplug it at night before going to bed (and our room is at the other end of the house).
3,It leaks!!,"I had mine for sometime and it worked, but nowit leaks around the top lid. A little stream ofwater goes out and down the side, to the floor.There is no rubber gasket around the top lid,to seal it and keep the water from leaking out.I went through two whole buckets of water; untilI got a flashlight and looked real close. Sureenough, a little, barely visible stream of waterpouring down on side. The right, facing it. Iwrapped the lid in aluminum foil and put itback on, that sealed it good. Now no leak!!"
1,hate it,"I am sure this is a great product if you have room for it. It was giant and I just hated it. Seemed like the water got yukky really fast and it was so big to move, clean and change the water. I got a smaller one and it is so much nicer"
3,drinkwell big dog pet fountain,Works as advertised. I think I expected something more substantial as far as the construction goes. It appears to be a cheap plastic item selling for a high price.
2,Big Dog Fountain,"Received this item (ASIN:B000FGIUV0 Drinkwell Big-Dog Pet Fountain]in good order, and it operated as advertised, I initially thought this would be a good solution for keeping fresh water for my two dogs. Unfortunately, neither pet would drink from the fountain, and soon it became obvious that I needed to return their water bowl that I had taken up. I left the fountain on the floor and operating for several days, but to no avail."
2,Unless you enjoy cleaning the bowl often - do not buy.,"The water bowl works - and it wasn't terribly difficult to clean every 2 weeks (per the recommendation). It takes about 30-45 minutes to clean. The problem now is that we actually let it go for 3 weeks and now the thing is a mess. Yellow gunk that used to easily wipe off after 2 weeks is requiring a significant amount of scrubbing.I will probably have to use a wire brush if I don't decide to just scrap it. It's currently sitting in the sink soaking because it was taking a lot of scrubbing to get the residue off. And I haven't even started on the small parts that require a q-tip and toothbrush to access.I'm not saying the product doesn't work as advertised, but be prepared to be cleaning...often."
2,Max didn't like it,"I bought this for my cat and dog. My cat Max has a fascination with running water so I thought he'd love this. Unfortunately, he didn't want anything to do with it. Also, too hard to clean and it is too big to fit anywhere in the kitchen. Returned item."
2,"Not bad, not great","I have 4 dogs and thought this would be a wonderful way to keep a larger amount of water on hand (rather than refilling a bowl several times a day), plus I loved the idea that the water would be oxygenated and filtered. Well, it does hold more water so I only had to refill it once a day. And it was easy to clean. But beyond that, I can't see the reason for spending $50 on this product. It does not filter the water and though the fountain would naturally add more oxygen to the water, I didn't feel it replaced me refilling a regular 'ole bowl a couple times a day with fresh water. We used it a week and then returned it."
5,Fantastic Product!,The Big Dog Drinkwell Fountain is one of the best Pet products I have purchased! I have a great dane who was draining my Drinkwell Platinum in one sitting. This fountain holds plenty of water for him and all the other critters in the house. I liked it so much I bought a second one for upstairs. A++++++ Love it!
4,Very good idea.,"I purchased this for my dog. Not because she drinks a ton of water necessarily but because she seemed to like drinking straight from a stream of water. I would take her running and pour her water directly from the bottle to my hand and she seemed to prefer drinking straight from the stream. She doesn't drink from the stream of the Drinkwell Fountain like I thought she would. So for her I'm not sure this item is necessary. She doesn't seem to like it anymore than a bowl of stagnant water, but I do like the reserve and the amount of water this thing holds. I only have to fill up the reserve once every week and a half to 2 weeks. Hopefully my dog will start enjoying this item more come summer time."
5,Perfect for Multiple Pet Homes,Product was exactly as depicted. Works well for multi-pet homes. No negatives I have found as of yet.
1,Dont work very good,We bought it in may 2012 and we keep it clean a least 1 time month and it started to slow down on the output for the water flow about 2 months ago. We just unplugged it as it was so slow output of water and we would never buy this model again. All it is now is a not working bowl of water. DONT BUY
3,"Leaked a lot, but dog liked it","We received this as a gift about 2 years ago. It worked to stop our poodle from turning on the tap in the bathtub for a drink (which was a problem, as she didn't think to turn it back off when she was done). We had quite a few leaking problems, though, and recently it stopped working altogether. I'll be replacing it with something different."
4,Great idea but.............,"I like that the water won't get stagnant and nasty, but I thought it would be quieter. It is pretty loud but I guess it could be worse. My dog loves the fresh water from it so it's worth it."
2,"Loud and Leaking, First Use.","I literally just received this about an hour ago and was super excited to set it all up. It arrived in two days when it wasn't expected until Tuesday (today is Saturday). That was nice. So far, I've noticed it leaks a lot. It's not from my dogs as they haven't been around it much since I set it up. Plus my dogs are tiny. The leaking isn't as bad now as it was right after setting it up. It's also very loud. I am going to email the company like another reviewer suggested and ask for a complimentary motor. And see if they have any recommendations for the leaking issue. I'll give it a week. If CS doesn't help me out, it's going back and I'll just get a larger water dish for my dogs.Okay, it's been concluded the leaking is from splashing, so we turned down the stream and will see how it goes. BF has also come home and said the motor is definitely bad. I am sending an email to request a new one and will see how it goes. :)"
2,fountain for large dogs,"We found at first it to be a nice fountain, however ...........We no longer use this product, the way it is assembled with the motor housing connecting to the bottom, occasionally would vibrate water out onto the floor, we had a tray underneath the fountain, but to come in and find a lake wasn't a good feeling.We opted for a different fountain, the pioneer pet big dog, it holds a little less water but the pump is on the inside and water will only spill out if it is overfilled."
4,Drinkwell Big Dog Fountain,"Fountain is great for keeping dog watered. But after refilling reservior bottle, then turning bottle upside down, it is a problem putting bottle back on the unit with out dumping water all over. Needs a valve of some kind, like is what is on one of the smaller reservoir units."
5,Star rating of 10,"Would have been better if I ordered this months ago..Great water bowl, bigger than I expected. I have two dogs and three cats and this was the best purchase I have made . Would highly recommend this for any pet owner.."
5,My pets love this product!,"I have 2 cats and a dog, and one of the cats love drinking from the faucet. As a result from Drinkwell, she doesn't hop on the kitchen/bathroom counter anymore! I decided to purchase the dog version, as it holds more water and doesn't spill easily. I am extremely please with this fountain and recommend to anyone who has dogs as well as cats."
1,Read Specifications Carefully,"Our suggestion is that you think carefully which model you want. We've used the Platinum model (Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain) successfully with our Boxers for years, and after the one we had wore out, purchased the Big Dog model thinking we'd be able to reduce how often we filled the fountain. We didn't read the specifications as completely as we should have, though, and when it arrived we realized that it's not a low voltage pump. Our dogs have been known to chew random things, and although they've never gone after a power cord, and although we do have ground fault circuit interrupters on the power outlets, feeding 120 Volts into a pet fountain isn't the best design. We returned the Big Dog model in its original packing and ordered the Platinum instead."
5,Excellent,"I bought this product after searching many websites and reading lots of reviews. Amazon had the best price, much better than my local Concord Pets store. I have two large dogs (both over 60 lbs) and three cats. We fill the jar at the back once a day and clean it every couple of days because hair collects in it. The cats love it and everyone is drinking more than they did before. Excellent buy."
3,Stopped Working After 6 Months,"We have a Pomeranian as well as a 192 pound English mastiff and purchased this for Athena {Mastiff} as she goes through a lot of water and we change and clean the bowl several times a day. We were very pleased when we first got this item and it worked well for 3 months. Then, it started getting louder. Finally, last night, it quit all together after only 6 months.I hate to say this BUT I'll probably order another hoping I simply got a defective unit as I can find nothing else out there big enough and it makes keeping clean water available much easier.****UPDATE- June 25th, 2012*****My wife, removed the pump motor, cleaned all of the hair off of it and it is NOW working great!"
4,More interesting to drink from than the toilet,Finally a water dish my dog finds more interesting than the toilet. The only negative is it is more time consuming to clean than a regular dish. It has to be taken apart once a week to remove dog hair and other debris that gets caught in the mechanism that circulates the water. It's not difficult to do and cleaning the dish takes less than five minutes.
1,Big Dog Waterer,Save your money. Worst waterer I have ever purchased. Water in bowl must be changed and the bowl cleaned daily. The pump is noisy. The waterer takes alot of time to clean it even with the cleaning kit. Buy an Ergo Pet Waterer if you want a fountain that actually supplies enough water for a big dog and does not need to be cleaned every day.
1,Too Loud to Keep,"I bought this for two cats. I had this unit for less then 4 months. It got so loud that I had to shut it off. It still worked. Too bad, really. My cats loved it! Now I'm afraid to buy another one. PLUS, I shipped it back to Drinkwell for a refund and they did not give me one."
3,"big dogs, little water","Overall it's a good product... But I was expecting a larger water container on top so that it wouldn't need refilling as often. The water control does little to change the flow of water. My dogs like it, so it's ok."
5,great product,I have a cat that loves to drink from the sink. I was hoping that the fountain would keep the cat out of the sink and it helps but not totally. It took about one day for the dog to get used to the fountain. Overall I love it because I no longer have to worry about a dry water bowl. At first I was skeptical about the whole cleaning process but it isn't difficult. I like to empty it and refill it twice a week instead of once.
5,like it alot!,"My dogs didn't take to it right away. It took awhile for them to get used to it. I gave it 5 stars because I'm not cleaning and filling up their water bowl every 4 hours (I have 2 big ""kids""). I fill up the reservoir maybe once a day. Cleaning wasn't as bad as I thought after reading the other reviews I was dreading it, but its really not that hard. I love my Drinkwell, it was well worth the $$!"
4,Great for all my animals!,"Cats love to watch it, and the filter helps get rid of the big dog's slobber for them. The reservoir tank is great, otherwise I'd be filling this thing several times a day. I do wish the pump was a bit more powerful and filtered out more and that it was easier to change the water, but can't think of a way to make it any easier other than picking it up and dumping it out. All in all a great purchase."
2,Drinkwell disappointment,"bought this in Dec, broke down in early Feb.the last Drinkwell I bought kept flooding my kitchen so I thought I would get one with a bigger bowl. no flooding. just stopped working. was great while it lasted."
2,Faulty Design,Good & Bad AspectsProblem #1: The water pump can become somewhat loud. Loudness might increase in time. Volume level seems to change within the same day. Cleaned the pump but is still somewhat loud.Problem #2: One model leaked water. Leaking seemed sporadic. Yes my dog dripped water but it wasn't only from the dog.Problem #3: Water bottle lid is not always tight enough.Good Side#1: This model held more water than other models. Don't know why others hold so little water. Who wants to run the risk of running out of water?#2: Can reduce number of times one refills the water jug by simply keeping a gallon water jug by the system. Pour water into the open area once in a while. Then there's less need for the system to tap into the smallish water jug to keep system full with water.I will order a new model hoping for better luck. Why? It hold more water than any other filtered water system i found.Just my perspective. You might have better luck. [...] about my postings.
2,Loud and cheap,"My one dog that is usually scared of everything loves it but my other one who explores everything is afraid of it. The noise seems to have got louder after I received it. The material really looks like cheap plastic, would pay more for maybe a better looking quieter unit. If anyone knows of one sold on Amazon, let me know. Thanks!"
4,Overall good product,"I have multiple cats and a large dog. The regular Drinkwell fountains were too small of a capacity...my dog would have drank it dry. I found this one on Amazon for much less than local and online pet stores. The 2 gallon capacity is terrific, lasts us days and days. It is fairly quiet, the motor hums but I can live with it. The one downside that I found was with the charcoal filter. Even though I rinsed it well before using, there still was quite a bit of black residue in the bowl. It happened every time I refilled the fountain, the residue was present after a day or so. I ended up taking the filter out, and that solved the problem. Overall, I am happy with the purchase."
5,"7 Dogs, 3 cats","Drinkwell Big-Dog Pet FountainWOW! What a product!! I was using two 1/2 gallon bowls for the kids (7 dogs, 3 cats) and was changing and washing them 2-3 times a day. With the Drinkwell Fountain (Big-Dog) I just fill up the reservoir once or twice a day. The filter keeps the water clean of hair and slobber. Cleaning the fountain is very simple - even my husband can do it! The cats drink exclusively from the stream coming out of the spout. The dogs, being dogs, just DRINK! They seem to drink more water, too. I wish I would have thought of this product, I wouldn't still be a poor but honest landscaper!Thanks again,Mari - Elk, WA"
3,Ok But,"For starters I like the product however, if your dog is a messy drinker like mine, meaning they leave lots of drool while drinking as my lab does this is not the product for you. The first issue the filter does not clean the dirty water. this means you have to clean the fountain daily and because of the size its a pain to clean. I wanted to try something new which i did and now i am going to switch back to the Hagen Dogit Design Fresh and Clear Dog Drinking Fountain which is a better product for my messy drinker."
1,Complete waste of money,"I have 5 dogs and 2 cats. 3 weiner dogs, 1 basset hound and a cocker spaniel (just do you know sizes). The quantity of water this holds isn't the issue. I fill it up about 2 times a week- which is fine. The issue is that the filter is pathetic and doesn't filter a thing. In a matter of hours after I fill the water and clean the whole unit, it is funky again. I had a non- filtering water jug for years before investing in this and never saw anywhere near the mess this makes. Further, it is a pain to clean to get into all of the crevices and really make sure it is ready to go. If there was a way to return it still I would, but I bought it about 4 months ago now. SAVE YOUR MONEY. There is a reason Amazon now has this product 'under review'. Useless."
3,Great BUT....,"My cat loves this thing. When I had it unplugged, she would sit next to it and wait for it to be plugged in. Occasionally she would peer around the back of it trying to figure out what magic I did to cause it to pump. The dog used it as a big water bowl. All was well, until I noticed that the under fountain mat was full of water. Assuming that my neglect to clean the pump weekly led to a malfunction, I ordered a new on and put it in-still leaked.Upon close inspection I found a hairline crack where the pump joins the body. I have read other reviews that mention this so I imagine that this is somewhat common? The pump can be very hard to twist out (partially because it is rather difficult to access due to its location) and perhaps this wears the plastic down more easily?I do plan to order a new fountain.P.S. if you get this, GET A MAT FOR UNDER IT TOO."
4,Drinkwell Pet Fountain,A Christmas gift for my 3 cats. This is a nice water dish and fountain - but the sides are a little too high. I have to make sure that there is a lot of water in it or my cats have a hard time drinking from it.
4,Holds so much water!,"Holds enough water for my two big dogs for three to four days. I typically don't plug it in to run the fountain, and it works great either way."
5,Dogs love it!,"I used to have one of those 5 gallon self filling dispensers and my dogs were always in the toilet getting drinks. With this thing they drink from their bowl now, the water stays clean and fresh."
5,big dog pet fountain,"The fountain is very good, and the large reserve tank lasts a long time.The filter keeps the water very clean. The fountain is very easy to clean."
5,My cats and small dog love it!!,"I was concerned that it would be to big for my cats and 20lb. dog. I was wrong. They all love the fountain!!! I have several smaller fountains that I have to refill every other day, this fountain only has to be refilled once a week. I do find it hard to clean due to it's size, but I still give it 5 stars. Amazon also has it priced way cheaper than I could find it anywhere locally."
4,Pet Fountain,Have had this item a few weeks now and like everything about it. It's only drawback as I can see is the water circulating noise.It is not loud but always in the background.My Lab seems to like the water better than just being in a bowl.So far it is a great product.
2,stopped working after...,"2 months. it worked great at the beginning and my dogs loved it. but one day it just stopped working. have to advise that it is pretty tricky to clean, a lot of grime collects in the fountain tubes and very difficult to get out."
5,Great for households with more than one big dog,"We bought this fountain when we adopted our second Weimaraner. It is great because, unlike typical water bowls, we do not have to refill as often. The biggest problem we have is when our dogs have dirt on their snouts, it gets into the bowl. You have to then unplug, dump out the water, sponge it out, and refill. It is simple to clean, however.The sound that others have complained about is bearable. It simply sounds as if you have a gently running fountain in your home. The running water becomes grey noise quickly. Although, we did check to see if a faucet or toilet was running before we were completely used to it.I would definitely recommend this product for any household that has more than one large dog because it cuts down on the number of times a water dish needs to be refilled, provides non-stagnant water, and is easy to work with."
2,Will not buy again,"While the idea of this product is great-- the reliability has a lot less to be desired. I have bought two of these in the past two years and I had to get rid of both after the electric pump went out. The first time, I figured it was a fluke. But when the second one went out after 6 months...I realized it is bad mfg. I loved the 100 oz reservoir, but once the pump goes out...the water just sits and builds up crud in the bowl."
1,It leaked and it's loud,"I was looking for a recirculating water dish with a large capacity that was slightly elevated for my three dogs. It leaked all over my hardwood floors despite several tries at setting it up, following the directions, and putting it on a blanket to catch the expected dog dribbles. It is also loud - even 10 feet away from the couch, it sounded like a running faucet. It also didn't seem to filter as well as I had expected. Dog hair and drool still lingered in the bowl. I gave it a few days and attempts, but I have to send it back. I would not recommend it. I think stainless would be easier to keep clean. Here's hoping I can find an elevated, stainless steel, large capacity, quiet dog water fountain.Pros: large capacityCons: loud, leaked, didn't filter well"
1,After 12 hours it made way to much noise,It was so loud my dogs wouldn't even go near it. Tried all the recommended fixes and nothing worked. Returned the water fountain
5,third time is a charm...,"after purchasing a competitors watering dish with the filtered water circulating fountain and experiencing both leaking out the bottom, we took a chance on the Big Dog by Drink-Well. first off the quality is 100% better than the other (Pet Mate) two purchased prior to the Drink-Well. the entire unit is solid and is enjoyable for all when the water spills onto the splash plate... giving the impression of an indoor water feature. Totally recommend to anyone looking for this type of watering device for their pet."
1,not the best cover,"While this works much better than a balnket there are far better covers out there. I received this in a bag of baby stuff passed down from a friend. I am a small framed woman and this is just too wide in the sholders so I have to tighten it too much causing it to no longer cover me. If I have hike up my top to nurse this does not do a good job of covering your bare sides or back. Just not enough fabric to go around. The picture showes it realy long but that is not how it is all around, just the in the front. Would have returned it had i purchased it."
2,It's ok!,"It is a little hard to wear... It shows skin instead of covering all the area. Unless, I'm wearing it wrong?!"
2,Can't figure out how to use this,I haven't really been able to figure this privacy wrap out. It just lays flat on the baby unless I pull it back with my hand. Maybe I'm not using it correctly.
2,Didn't like it,"I returned this item after I received it. I could barely figure out how to put it on since it is shaped so strangely and the fabric was worse and heavier than barber shop cloaks. About equally fashionable too! Bottom line, not cute AND not that useful."
2,Too short and color is too dark,"I don't mind the odd shape of this shawl so much, and the thumb loops top and bottom are kind of handy. However, the thumb loops are absolutely necessary, because my daughter could easily pull it off otherwise (because it was so short). It also gets VERY dark in there unless I continually hold the top loop away from my body, which makes my arm tired pretty quickly.I went back to using a light-colored large baby blanket - it provides better coverage, and my daughter doesn't try to throw it off, because she can still see."
3,"Nice, but not for me.","It's a nice product but it doesn't work well with my small frame. My son moves a lot while nursing so when the cover pulls I don't feel like it's discreet enough. Also, my son ends up sweating a lot while being covered with this."
1,TOO SMALL!!!!,"I am not obese by any means, but I have huge baby feeders now that they are full of milk! If you are in my boat, this wrap is terrible! I can't even fit my babies head underneath of this cover... terrible and I wish someone else would have told me!"
1,nursing wrap,"I'm very disappointed in the wrap style--I owned an older version of a First Years wrap which was navy blue, more of a square shape, and snapped around the neck. That style was what I was hoping for--this one is much more difficult to use. It is cumbersome to put on and secure and is rather short."
1,Awful. Do not buy.,"This is a terrible product. I used it once and I was so appalled that I returned it the very next day. First off, the fabric is cheap and doesn't breathe - it's the same fabric as a cheap witch's Halloween costume. And because it's such a light fabric, the slightest breeze will move it and expose you (not wanting to be exposed is the whole point, is it not?). The neck is wide, but it doesn't stand away from you, so I had to have my husband hold the neck part away from me while I tried getting the baby situated under the cover. Also, it's quite short in front (the back is VERY short), and it was difficult to figure out how to position it so that I wasn't exposed. All in all a perfectly dreadful product. Spend the extra money and get something that actually works. Too bad, because I have other products from this company that are great."
3,so-so wrap,"I ordered this because the picture made it look like it was a larger wrap that covers the whole baby. The material is stiff and might soften up after a few washes, and the wrap is rather short, especially if your baby is a fiesty one like mine. It sort of reminds me of a large skirt with a tie. I have tried to purchase cheaper wraps just to try them out, but now realize that it's best to just get a decent one that covers well even if it's a bit more expensive - I now have 2 useless wraps and I could have put that money together for 1 good one! Live and learn."
3,Not breathable material,I got the nursing wrap as a baby shower gift from my registry. Love how it looks in the picture but when I first used it I noticed how unbreathable the material was. It clearly states on the box that wrap is made with breathable material. It's made of %100 polyester.
4,Petrodex,Our dog has the best clean teeth...thanks to Petrodex. Buying it on line saved me money & time. Our poodle loves petrodex strips.
3,Caviat,Comes w/ JBuilder4. However an activation key is required. I registered and was assured my activation key would be e-mailed to me. NOT!
4,"Not as good as the first , but it'll do","After listening to the first ultra dance, i was psyched to get this album. i listened to it and enjoyed it, however there are a few songs that i didn't agree with. those songs were ""Omnibus,Open Your Box & Work"". I admit Omnibus was good at the beginning, but it just got gay after the baby vocals said omnibus for the first time. but the real evil of this album was disc 2's ""Open Your Box & Work"". Open Your Box actually made want to A)hammer a nail right into my forehead or B)take a bat with a nail sticking out of it and...you know and the same goes with Work.The rest of the album is good and/or decent,personal favorites are Res,the Riva/Dannii Minougue collaboration,Jam & Spoon,DJ Tiestos collaboration with Suzanne Palmer and his remix of Moby and Tigas cover of ""sunglasses At Night""."
2,Not As Good as Ultra Dance 1....,Ultra Dance 2 did not have the same high-driven intensity as Ultra Dance 1. I found alot of the beats to be over repetitive and became very monotanous. I was kind of disappointed that it did not elevate from the Ultra Dance 1 set.
4,It's got a good beat...and you can dance to it,"For those of you looking for a good dance mix, this is one of the better ones out there. The 25 tracks range from pop remixes (""Thank You"" by Dido and ""We Are All Made of Stars"" by Moby) and dance mixes (""They Say Vison"" by Res and ""Fire"" by Dolce) to some great electronica, including ""Star Guitar"" by Chemcial Brothers, ""Nebuchan"" by Frank T.RA.X. and ""Omnibus"" by Laut Sprecher. The songs segue into one another nicely so you can keep on moving.One or two of the songs may seem a little off pace, like ""the Sound of Goodbye"" by Perpetuous Dreamer which appears to slow the beat a little, but overall, this is a good collection of somgs."
3,Sweet and tinny,"Not a much fun as it should have been. It's alright. Very happy -- I enjoy something hard-hitting, too. Disc #2 is not too great... the ""Like A Prayer"" remake is just embarrassing. The collection may have received one more star except for the sound quality was ""tinny"" to me -- needs to boost the bass."
5,It just works!,"One of these and a microfiber cloth and you will be done drying off the car in no time. When I first heard of these, I thought ""who would want to squeegee a car?"" I found one on clearance at Target and figured I had little to loose. WOW! It just does what it is supposed to do. Sure, it works best on the flat areas, but you can figure out how to deal with the contours. I use it with one of those yellow microfiber cloths from Costco.Keep it in the car for those days your sprinklers go off.It's simple, it works. What else do you want? Get one."
2,Miss Leading,"The picture of the product shows 3 items...but when you get the item, there is only one. Yes One. I could have purchased two of the same items at my local Costco for the same money. The vendor is mis-leading us by showing 3 items in the ad but in reality is only giving 1...Short story, they should be removed from Amazon."
2,So-So,"This blade may work all right if your vehicle surface is mostly flat, but if you have a lot of contours on the sides, forget it. It does not conform to the shape of the vehicle."
1,This product may not work too well for you.,"A buddy gave me his California Blade because he didn't find it very useful. I used it maybe a couple of times and would have to agree with him. Not only did it not remove all the water like a good chamois does, it left white residue tracks, which I believe were mineral deposits from the hard water as it was drying and became concentrated. It might work for you if you have naturally soft water, or use rain water to wash your car, but if you have hard water, forget about it. If this thing was so amazing, it would have taken over the market from all the chamois type products. All I can conclude is that the glowing reviews you see are from people selling these things."
4,A must for the DIY detailer,"The Jelly Blade, with its silicone material, does a very nice job conforming to the shape of the car. It also tends to get far more water off in a single pass than a rubber squeegee, and thus is great for windows too. Watch out, though: it's easy for gritty materials to get trapped in the blade where you can drag them across your car. Wipe off the blade frequently and you should be good to go!"
3,Think fingernails on a chalkboard!!,"This gadget is great at removing water from the shower door and tile to prevent hard water stains from building up and takes very little hand strength to do the job, but the noise it makes is awful. I use it anyway but my husband still uses our ratty 40-year-old squeegee with a rubber blade. Oh well..."
2,Double sided DVD's seem prone to disc errors,"The content is great, Farscape was a wonderful show that I'd recomend to anyone, but these double sided DVD's seem very prone to disc errors. This is the 3rd out of 5 Farscape Starburst Edition DVDs that I've had to return due to an error on one or more of the discs. Amazon's customer service was exceptional, I had a replacement DVD within a few days. The replacement DVD seems to be OK, though I haven't watched every minute of each disc yet, I only hope that it is."
3,Not ready for residential use,"After giving up on home style vacuums I decided to go with ""more power"" in the Shop-Vac. While I am thrilled with the performance of the shop-vac, my fiance is not. It seems that shop-vac is a bit to clunky to pull around the house, furthermore the attachments are too industrial for carpets and rugs. This might be a different story if these carpets and rugs were under a foot of water or covered with nails and debris. In conclusion, if you must have a shop vac in your house (as I must), opt for the smaller model."
5,"Reaches my Soul, Beautifully Relaxing","I've listened to many New Age Albums none of which are any better than this one. I listened to it on the road to church every Sunday along with my 5 children. It was a time to focus on good things, to uplift the soul, to think about that which is better. I truly love this music!"
5,Beautiful!,"I bought this CD for my Mom as a surprise after finding the cassette tape. She mentioned listening to it all the time years ago and how much she missed it. When the CD arrived, it was packaged wonderfully and looked brand new! It works fine and is a beautiful album. I look forward to purchasing items from this seller in the future. :)"
5,Perfect size,The filters fit my six cup hamilton beach brew station perfectly. There is no trimmimg necessary like with the standard size filters.
4,Disco CD Review,"I cannot rate this item fully as i only purchased it for a particular song. I am well satified with the music that i bought it for. I have not listened to any of the other music yet,but plan to soon."
2,Worlds Apart Falls Apart,The book was not well written and the plot was tiring. It promised more than it gave; didn't come through.
3,worlds apart,"My husband and I both read this delightful book and thoroughly enjoyed it--this romantic novel was fun to read! John Sergey is adept at displaying his feelings through the written word. It is rare to find male authors that are daring enough to reveal what really goes on inside a man's heart. Women will love this novel because it fulfills the need that we have to understand the male psyche. Men will love it because it validates their own inner yearnings and self-doubts, along with their need to touch base with their spiritual self. This was a fast-paced romance with pearls of spiritual wisdom thrown in for good measure. Ladies, read this book- then pass it on to the men in your life!"
2,Vaccum requires specific bag,"I wish that it had been made clearer that each bag type, meaning size matches specific ShopVac. So in short these do not fit the 4 Gallon ShopVac, so the bags are useless to me. I wish i could give or sell them to someone that could use them."
4,shop vac,"This vac is very light weight and is perfect to pick up cat hair, etc. on the floor. The instructions could be better written. It was hard to figure out how to put the bag in."
3,"Tough to load, bag is a bit fragile","I have a Shop-Vac All-Around that finally got full, so I had to get these to be able to keep vacuuming. Unfortunately, the cardboard bit is tough to maneuver into the slot on the Shop Vac, and the surrounding bag tends to get in the way. As a result, the first one I tried to load got torn slightly while loading, so it's useless. I was more careful with the second one, but it's like having a zipper that always gets caught unless you do it very slowly and keep holding the fabric out of the way. Sure, you can get it down eventually, but it's a pain in the neck.So, once the bag is loaded, does it do its job? Yes. But loading it is more difficult than it should be. And if you tear one, you just raised your cost per bag 50%."
2,Typical mallgoth gear.,"Well, okay, I guess it's a little ridiculous to go looking for a high-end couture studded dog collar, but surely you could do better than this. Examine, if you will, the product picture. Does that look like real leather to you? Nuh-uh. Didn't think so. I'd give this thing two weeks before the studs started coming unglued. Cheap manufacturing at its most obvious and least flattering.Buy it only with low expectations. You have been warned."
1,Avoid - awful picture and sound quality,"Avoid - awful picture and sound quality. That's it. Even if the story is ok, You can't stand so lousy quality. It is like I have my old VHS copied in basement. Simply terrible."
2,Required text for graduate course,I had to purchase this text for a graduate teaching course. I thought it was useless. We only referenced it once or twice. A waste of money.
4,LeapFrog 100 Hoops Basketball Counting Game,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter because she loves to count and loves to play with balls. As a typical 3 year old, her attention span lasts for so long so she doesn't always play with it, but when she does she likes to count along with it. She knows how to press the button in the hoop that triggers the counting, so she doesn't always use the ball. She know how to count to 20. Since this toy has options to score up to 10, 20, 50, or 100 points, I'm hoping it will help her learn how to count higher. It also has a Spanish language feature which I think is great. You can also choose for the numbers to count sequentially or in reverse."
5,My 4 year old LOVES IT!!!,This is a great concept!!! My 4 year old loves to shoot baskets and learn Spanish at the same time! My 2 & 3 year old nieces love it too.
3,Wish my son liked it more,"My son LOVES basketball and anything to do with balls. We bought this for him so he would learn to count to 100 and benefit from the other mathematical activities it has. He used it twice and got bored with it. He'd rather go outside and play with his big hoop.I love leapfrog products and usually my son does too, but he doe not love this product for some reason."
4,Really Cool Toy,"Okay, my kids are not play with the toy too much but it is a really neat toy. I'm going to give it some time and I think they will play with it more. Great concept, easy to hang, not to big and seems to be well made."
1,Check out the size,"Our 2 year old son loves to dump his this huge ball in a wastepaper basket that we have. So for his birthday we figured we would get him an actual basketball especially one that counts. When we opened the package we were really disappointed to see that the ball was a tiny, flaky ball. So we didn't even bother to open the toy and returned it."
4,Score 1 for LeapFrog,"What a neat idea! We got this for our 18month old son for Christmas. He loves it! Especially the cheering sound effects. It counts in English or Spanish, too. Even my four year is trying her hand at counting up to 100! Best of all it's portable. We can hang it on a chair in the kitchen, a bedroom doorknob of even the top of the door (for my daughter).Great pick!"
1,Great Title- Same Thing As Buying The Tapes,"This has a great title, but there's one problem: it's the same as buying the tapes! It's simple: Wings, Wheels and Waves is the same as Round and Round We Go and When I Grow Up is the same as You Can Be Anything. If your child's a Barney fan, get the other tapes."
2,Too much Barney talking and not enough dancing,"There are some good scenes in the DVD showing toddlers and older kids dancing. However, most of the DVD is Barney talking. I wanted more dancing tunes, and more dancing. I wanted to have the little guy see other kids dancing to music. Mostly what you get here is Barney. I would imagine that the owners of Barney are always trying to sell the Barney franchise. However, what I wanted is not the promotion of Barney but the promotion of dancing for kids. This video was not very helpful for getting the little guy to move and dance. Too bad, since Barney has the money to produce excellent videos. This one falls short."
4,Lots of music and fun!,"I thought this DVD was Barney-rific! Full of music and silly songs, my boys were dancing all over. It is funny too because they typically don't prefer to watch Barney, but they do love anything with music. I love that it came with a bonus CD that I can keep in the car. This is a great DVD for both old and new Barney fans!"
4,A Male Sade?,"I was listening to Phil Carmen while living in his homeland (Switzerland) for a decade in the 80s and 90s. As is the case with most European artists, they record in English in order to have a more marketable product. This guy is so talented, and has always had a cocktail lounge jazz sound. If you like this, then you'll also enjoy Matt Bianco, Sade, Vikto Lazlo, etc."
4,Traffic Accident Investigators' Lamp Analysis Manual,"Very comprehensive on this subject, generally good photography of filament conditions. The concepts within each section could be a little better organized tend to jump around a bit.I would recommend this for either a newcomer of an experienced investigator in this field."
4,Traffic Accident Investigatior Lamp Manual,"A very good book to understand the different failure modes when incandescent lightsource are used in a car, excellent pictures and examples, the procedures description are in use now, on the other hand a revision must be made to update with new lightsources used in the market; like HID (High Intensive Discharge) & the use of LED in traffic accidents, color pictures are neccesary to understand some failure modes, will be nice to add in the next edition."
5,COLOMBIAN CHRISTMAS MUSIC,I LOVED THIS TWO- CD AUTHENTIC COLOMBIAN SONGS. ONE CD WAS TRADITIONAL MUSIC AND THE OTHER ONE WAS TYPICAL COLOMBIAN DANCE MUSIC FOR NEW YEAR AND CHRISTMAS. VERY NICE
3,not large enough,These onesies are very wide but not really any longer than the 24 month ones I already have.
3,Fits Small,"Good quality material however the onesies fit small for the weight, I recommend getting a size up. My son is considered small for his age and weight and the onesies (3T) don't have much growing room and they shrink quite a bit. However, the quality of the onesies are good."
4,All Gerber onesies run small,"I love these, but they run small like all other Gerber onesies. Make sure you buy the next size or two larger than you need!"
5,Gerber Onesies,This was an easy transaction. Item delivered quickly and exactly what I thought it would be.
5,Perfect,I couldn't find 3T onesies locally for by very large 14 month old. Ordered from Amazon and they came on time and arrived as expected. My little guy wears one every day!!
3,"If you liked ""Little Light of Love,"" this is worth a listen.","If you liked Fifth Element's ""Little Light of Love"" then this is certainly worth a listen. I think there are some really good songs here, and a few really mediocre ones too. Eric's movie soundtrack material, Peter Grabriel-ish Rock, and Middle Eastern rhythms/melodies were all thown together into a blender and the result is R.X.R.A. Nourith (the female singer from ""Little Light of Love"") appears in four tracks; check her out in ""Anybody Hello!"""
2,Warning: This is not an instrumental album.,"If you love Eric's movie sound tracks and are looking for more of his instrumental work, you're not going to find it here. Yes the music itself does hint at some of the styles of instrumentation, beats, and melodies that he brings to his film score work. But if I had heard this CD without knowing who the artist was, I never would have made the connection to any of his sound tracks. At least not until the very last cut which I would have instantly recognized as being from ""The Fifth Element"". :-)Bottom line, if you enjoy progressive rock in general, you may well enjoy this CD. But if you're looking for more of his instrumental works, look elsewhere."
5,Heads above its competition!,"I got tired of the filter keep falling down my Ridgid 10-gallon shop vacuum (not to mention the hose keeps getting pulled off the unit), so I ordered this Shop-vac on a whim.What a pleasant surprise! Superior suction, much quieter motor and accessories that fit together like a glove (including a locking hose to unit connector). This is a well-made basic shop vacuum at a very attractive price!"
5,"Lean, Mean and Clean","We live at the bottom of a hill so every time it rains we get an inch of water in the basement. When our sump went out last month, we used this vac to bale out. Lots of sucking power, filled the tank in only a couple minutes each time. Emptied an entire 1,300 square foot basement in an hour and didnt overheat. A little loud in a tight spot like the cellar but worth it to stay dry. The extra long cord is a nice bonus too - almost 20 feet long so we didnt need an extension cord."
4,This Vacume Sucks!,"Pro: This Shop Vac really sucks... no joke! Has nice power even when filled with 45lbs of Plaster + DustPro: Long power cablePro: Nice friction on attachmentsPro: Nice attachments, good quality plastic and sizes.Meh: Difficult to wrap up long hose around unitMeh: Only large attachments come with Shop Vac.Meh: Makes noise? much quieter than regular floor vac though.Con: Wheels are big small - although hose will fit under unit without crushing hose.Con: Wheels get stuck on small wires, such as the electric cordCon: Doesn't roll very well when 1/2 full on carpet. Rolls like a champ on wood and tile though.Conclusion: This Shop Vac Sucks!"
4,"Overall, pretty good shop vac",Overall this is a good buy. My only complaint is something I have found with other shop vacs as well- the hoses have no locking mechanisms and the attachments come off rather easily. But this machine has a lot of power and I would reccomend it.
3,NOT DESIGNED BY USERS,"It is very powerful, sometimes to powerful. It picks up everything, a plus. Some poor design makes it a pain. Wheels stick out and catch on everything in the shop. Follows like a reluctant cat rather than a happy dog. Hose is too short and bends closed at the nozzle when you vacuum close or at the wrong angle. I had to duct tape it to stop it from bending. Hard to empty without using the bag. Bags are costly and if you pick up something by mistake you need to tear the bag open to find it. The hose is very fat and needs a handle to hold. Not too hard to figure out if you use it. Rockler did it, why not shop vac? Would have been nice if they had an automatic rewind for the cord. Also would have been nice to have a brush pickup. I would have paid more if these items were included."
3,Same problems as others...,"I had the same problem with these that other reviewers had, the strip is very difficult to get off. It pulls a lot of the paint out with it and the colors get dragged into each other. They sometimes rip before the end, leaving you struggling to find another ""in"" to get the rest of the strip off. However, the bright colors and thick consistency of the paint are very good for toddlers; this paint lends itself particularly well to fingerpainting. The only thing I don't much like about the paint itself is the rather strong musty smell. Otherwise love the product, but hate the packaging."
5,laughing and crying,Feng Shui for the Rest of Us changed my life... and it could change yours too! Gabrielle Alizay's book makes me laugh and cry ~ a great read while changing one's life!
1,Shill Alert,As of Jan 2007 all but three reviews of this book were made in November 2005. They read like they were written by the same person to me.
4,"A great book, even for the skeptic","I'm not the type who usually finds myself in the Feng Shui section of the bookstore (the book was a gift), and I'm not one to perform mystical rituals just because I read it somewhere. It is clear to me, however, that your environment can have a huge impact on your life, and that we could all do well to be more conscious of it.What's different about this book is that it teaches you awareness without dogma. It shows you how to find the not-so-positive aspects of your surroundings and what to do about them. But, most important for me, it never wags the finger or says, ""Do this or else."" Rather it challenges you to try a change or two, in a way that works for you personally, and then builds upon the positive results. Impressive!"
5,Success for the Rest of Us,"Gabrielle is wonderfully knowledgeable, cunningly crafty, and totally focussed. That's why this print version of her wisdom and ideas is a ""must have"" for anybody who wants to do a little (or a lot!) more in life. Witty, warm, wise."
3,Good cd player,This product is worth what I paid for...I didn't think thatbi would skip as much as it does if you just tap it on something just a little bit...but it's good enough for one of my resdients
1,unhappy Christmas..,Was suppose to b my daughters Santa gift but skips ...very dissappointed...wont buy another.. now we gotta find something else to put under the tree...
1,Coby makes junk,Got this for Christmas and it just stopped working 7 months later. It was used for night music to help our child fall asleep. We bought three Coby portable CD players (2 with radios) and now all three CD players have stopped working. I will never buy a Coby product again. I'm going Sony from now on.
2,Not the best quality,"Not the best quality, but what product is these days. I am going to have to replace them soon hopefully a more durable product. The open/close door button sticks so it wants to stay open more than it closes."
3,Hop and Skip,Although product was advertised to include anti-skip my experience is that it does in fact hop and skip at the slightest movement - can't walk for example due to skipping. Otherwise if your just sitting its works OK
1,DO NOT BUY -OR TOUCH!!,"Do not buy this item unless you plan to never touch it once you have started a CD. Not to change a selection!! Not even to change the volume. It skips with the LEAST LITTLE tap. Go ahead and spend a few more bucks if you plan to be AT ALL active with your player -""active"" means touching it!!"
1,Junk,"I bought this CD player to use as a feed through a tape deck on an older model car. It worked well for the first day and then started to crackle and pop constantly. At first I thought it was the car speakers, but then plugged my iphone into the tape deck and all sound issues went away. You get what you pay for with this CD player."
1,Coby is junk,"Hello All - Just thought I would let you know that ALL COBY products are JUNK, if you see the name COBY on something Run do not walk away!Never had a good experience w/ them - avoid like the plague (Sorry Amazon) but Coby is junk, Amazon is awesome and should not sell Coby products.Just letting you know.."
2,HI JUST GOT THE CD PLAYER TODAY,FROM WHAT I CAN TELL IT IS OK. BUT YOUR COMPANY NEEDS TO WORK ON THE SKIPING PROBLEM. OTHER THAN THAT IT WORKS FINE.
3,Disappointed in earphone connection,"I purchased this Coby Portable CD player as new andreceived it sealed and new as advertised.The seller shipped it quickly and securely.I like the slim design and color. I chose silver.The quality of the sound is great.My only complaint is that the connection for theearphones is not secure enough and apparentlyit keeps losing its connection causingthe sound to go dead.If I wiggle it or push it in harder, the sound returns,but I have to do this too often to enjoy a disturbancefree sound.I didn't pay too much for it, but wish I wouldhave done more research before purchasing.I guess you get what you pay for."
1,The first disappointing COBY product...,"I've always liked Coby products, but this one deserves no stars at all. This cd player is very inexpensive, and it only runs on batteries. It does not have an anti-skip feature, and it is extremely light sensitive. In order to have continuous play, it must be shielded from any environmental electrical current, sunlight, lamp, light fixture, flash, beam and ambient lighting. I recently bought three of the players (at that price, I figured I'd have a backup once I dropped it a few times), and I've completely ""used up"" two players. Each one completely died from less than 2 weeks of use. It seems the abuse of using the player in a lit environment ruins the electronic mechanism!"
3,Coby CX-CD109,"The product cannot be operated by AC converter; it operates by battery only. AMZN should specify this. Had I known, I'd have purchased something which had the specified capacity."
1,Broken!,It was broken before I could use it and I mailed it back immediately to the owner and have not received a refund as of this date.
3,OK unit,"For the price this portable DVD player is well worth it, & I'm enjoying listening.................."
3,bought for classroom,"I love having these for my listening center in my classroom. No students fight over who gets to pick a story, etc. However, they can sometimes be hard to open... you have to hit the open button and pull up on the top at the same time. Not in love with them but they do the job for my students."
2,Personal CD player,I was disappointed because is does not have an anti -skip. So when you move around with it it jump all over the place. The headphones work great .
2,Serious battery drain and skips if you look at it wrong,"Alright. I use rechargeable batteries now way more often because this darn thing sucks them dry like a kid with a slurpee that has never had a brain freeze. It also skips very easily, as I when people walk by my desk at work, if you tap the desk the entire system just shuts off. Wow. I'd forgotten how annoying this could be"
1,Junkie,Spend more money get something better! This is so bad that you have to be afraid putting your headphones in the slot that it may fall apart!
3,Coby Personal CD for Stevens,The CD players are easy for our kids to use. The only problem we had with a few of them were the buttons. They would get stuck. We have gotten them unstuck and they seem to be working well now. Sound is good and so far they seem to be able to endure 2nd graders.
1,Do not waste your $12. Broke in ~1 month.,"As mentioned before, this device is very sensitive to motion - tapping the table it is on causes the CD to skip. For the price though, that's not a show stopper - just put it on something soft. However, the unit I purchased lasted a little over a month before dying. Don't waste your $12 on the COBY slimline player."
4,Durable!,I use audio books daily in my classroom where each cd player is man handled 8 times at least. They lasted all school year and even if lids broke they still played cd!
3,NOT Portable and very touch-sensitive,"This CD player is very inexpensive, but because it's very inexpensive, it's qualities are so-so. The biggest setback is the battery life. At the most is five six hours of music and then the screen shows a low battery signal. Another setback is the portability. Picking the CD player up will immediately interrupt the music flow. So much for portability. Another setback is the ""skip"" feature. The CD player reads the CD very slowly so skipping a few songs takes as much as a few minutes at times.Overall the CD player is set a reasonable price considering its quality, but if you are an avid music listener, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,"Poorly made, yet easy for kids to use and so cheap to replace","This product broke for us after 3 months of use, right after the limited warranty ran out. Still we just ordered another one because it works very well for our purposes and is so cheap at $12. Our 4-year old likes to listen to music or stories on CD as she falls asleep at night. She was able to use this CD player very easily on her own. We considered buying her a small ipod nano but they are over $100 so replacing the broken CD player is far cheaper, even if we replace it multiple times. We also like having the control of her just listening to one CD at a time and not flipping through different songs or stories. She used it every day for the three months of its short life so perhaps we did get our money's worth, although I would have liked it to last longer."
1,Absolute worst CD player I've ever owned,The only good thing about this CD is it arrived in time...probably because they need to get rid of it. The absolute worst CD player I've ever purchased. But you get what you pay for. Biggest complaint: if you need to move around while listening to your music - this is not the product for you. Any slight movement at all and it skips. The buttons are very small and you need to press down on them very hard for them to actually work. Stay away from this product - the worst purchase I've ever made.
2,Okay for the Price,"This is definitely an entry level product. The button to open the lid got stuck on day two, fixable but annoying. The slightest jostle causes the unit to stop and then it restarts. I should have paid more and bought a unit that is stronger, more durable and portable."
1,Disappointment,"Unfortunately, just a few days after receiving this product, it stopped working. I tried changing the batteries and using a different CD, but the CD player would not work! Waste of my time and money."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"[[ASIN:B000CBB4N4 Coby Personal CD Player with Stereo Headphones CXCD109BLK , Black]Imagine hearing this: ""Now is the time"" [wait 10 seconds] ""for all good men to come"" [wait 5 seconds] ""to the aid of their country.""This product has never worked. It first played intermittently, so I thought there might be something wrong with the earphones. After switching earphones, the problem persisted. Now it doesn't work at all. I have owned this CD player for 7-8 days and used it for about 2 hours total. Complete waste of money."
3,Does what I wanted it to do,Bought this item to listen to my CD's rather than what was being played on the vehicle's radio. While the volume may leave somethingto be desired for the price who can complain?
1,broken cd player,i picked this rating because i paid for something that was broken. package was completely sealed. no dents. this product would not play any cd's. it kept on saying error.
1,Bought it for SAT's. Not much use anyway else.,"I bought this for the listening portion of the SAT's. It is big, bulky, and there is no way to turn it off to save battery. The headphones that come with it is terrible, so if you are really that interested in listening CD's while on the ""go"", you'll have to use your own headphones. The thing is about six inches long. Can't really fit anywhere but a backpack. The player constantly skips. I would never use this given the option of iPods and phones."
2,The player is inferior,"player does not have anti shake memory, is hard to read, does not remember where I stop, and gobbles battery"
3,It worked,"I was a bit skeptical because price is so low, but I only needed for my daughter's SAT test, and it did the job. Probably not for real music listening but good quality for what I paid, and satisfied."
1,COBY CX player,I bought two as the first one gave out. The second one gave out in 3 weeks. Not worth the disappointment.
1,cd player,"this item did not last a week until it quite workingCoby CXCD109BLK Personal CD Player with Stereo Headphones, Blackit will not play a complete cd, it quites about halfway through."
1,Junk,"Received Player but couldn't open the box for a month.Never worked. Never played one tune.Amazon should removed this junk.Since I tried it after the return period offered by Amazon, I stuck."
3,COBY CX-CD109 BLK,"You may end up having to purchase another model, I did. I suppose it's alright for a low cost effort to listen to music, yet it's still very jittery and the music itself becomes hard to listen to because of that. Much depends on the purchasers' interests and love of music."
4,Respectable CD Player,"Great sound...worth the money...there is nicer ones out there, but this one is a good deal for the price. Only one little problem: it stops for a second when it gets jarred."
2,DON'T BUMP,"THIS PLAYS FINE IF YOU ARE SITTING STILL AND DON'T MOVE OR BUMP THIS UNIT AT ALL, THIS IS NOT PORTABLE IF YOUR LISENING TO IT"
3,COBY CX-CD109 BLK Personal CD Player with Stereo Headphones,I got this for my 6 year old grandson who loves music. It is a good cd player that has stood up well from being dropped by my grandson. He likes it very well.
1,Skips bad!,"When receiving this product it was exactly as described. This worked perfect for about two days, then started skipping badly with brand new cds. Very disappointed and do not recommend."
2,If you want a temporary thing then this'll do,"With no mode settings(repeat, shuffle, etc) or shock protection, this cd player is pretty undesirable, but if you're just looking for something to hold you over then this'll do. It has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright. It could be with just mine, but every pair of headphones, new and old, that I use with it, the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers, they work fine. Like I said, if you just want a temporary thing then I guess this is good for you."
3,Average,"You get what you pay for, its cheap and thus very basic. Only power source accepted is batteries. Other than that plays well and sounds good, headphones are alright also."
2,Good cd player but not great,"was told when i purchased the cd player that it had non-skip capility but it does not and skips all over the place when it is bumped, so you have to play it on a surface that does not move."
3,"Low price, but greatThis is a very good",Very good CD player if you are not anal about non-skipping or other bells and whistles. It serves my purpose(s) perfectly .... even though the 1st one I received was broken. Amazon always makes good on their promises.
1,Substandard player,"I wouldn't buy another one of these, it skips alot. It is a very low performance player. Don't buy one."
2,Good for the price... but....,"The price is good. I bought this product to go with my lullabelly so I could play CD's for my baby. Also, I am 36 weeks pregnant so I didn't want to get something pricy that I'm only going to use for a month or so. Something cheap and simple. But it's supposed to be skip proof. The slightest tap will make it skip so I have to be very careful where I lay it to play. But for a few bucks, what can I say? It's a good cheap fix."
3,OK for the purpose.,"I rarely listen to CDs, and often just upload them to my I-Phone. But I'd been given a book on CD and wanted a player that I could move around. I tried to listen while gardening, but it skipped badly. Did fine on a firm surface, though. You get what you pay for."
3,Cheap and Effective for Stationary Use: Bad for Bumps and Batteries,"I purchased this CD player to use in my car via an mp3 to cassette adapter.Other reviews mentioned skipping: the player pauses when I drive over bumps, and on rough roads can sometimes pause for more than a minute before finding its place. However, for interstate driving it rarely pauses due to bumps and it fits my use well.The only other downside is a quick usage of batteries. I left it on overnight once and by the morning the almost-new batteries were dead.I recommend this player because of its price, but only for stationary use."
1,Wow!,I almost bought this thing....and then someone told me about the 'iphone' and MP3 music....Apparently you can play hundreds of songs on....your phone! Amazing! And to think I almost bought this CD player! What a fool I would have been!
1,"Ian, Bruces dad","CD player did not work when opened. Sounded like cd was rubbing when spinning. Got ""error"" message when disc was inserted. Tried 3 different cd's that all worked in other players. Do NOT buy. What do I expect for $10 bucks, nothing but the hassle of returning it."
1,you get what you pay for,"the headline says it all. the cd feature on my bose wave is broken, and i wanted to listen to some books on tape as i recovered from surgery.so.......i took the cheap way out. the thing ceased to function the second day. flimsy, plastic, chinese junk (not to be confused with the boat).if you want a portable cd player, go ahead and spend the extra money for something that will work."
1,Coby is bad,"I've gotten Coby products several times, and they are always very poorly made. I don't know how this company stays in business."
1,Returned It,"I had it for about 20 days. It seemed to be working at first, though I had to change batteries, very quickly, so I thought maybe it would stick on during the night, since I listen while I am falling off to sleep. Then a few days later, it just started to skip when I moved it even the slightest bit. I could deal with that for the price and since I would be listening in one position, and not for running or walking. Then it just started to click off in the middle of the CD, I tried different CD and it did the same thing. So, it may have just been a defective one. However, I returned it quickly, since it was obviously not functioning."
2,No good at all,My husband bought this so that he can hear his studying materials and he said that any move he makes the CD skips. He has to sit very still for it not to skip. Not worth the money.
1,Wish it worked,"It just did not work. From the first time I put a CD in it, it did not run, even though I had new batteries in it. I tried several CDs thinking maybe that was the problem. Still nothing. I moved it around in different positions and it worked when I had it standing up on its edge. Worked for all of two CDs. Now nothing. I know it was not very expensive, I did not need it to be the best, but I did expect it to work."
4,Funny!,Old school comedy. Crack up at the lauguage ( brings back memories) Recommend this for reliving the good ol' days.
5,Great,I first saw this movie as a teenager and now I'm a old man who still loves and cherishs this movie.
1,Racist thrash,White people draw garbage like this and they wonder why there's a race problem. I bet the Black actors who did the vioce work didn't see the drawings nor did they know what they were getting in to. Leave this in the rubbish.
1,Black Is Beautiful But This Film Is Ugly,"It's with little irony that ""Song of the South"" hasn't been available for public viewing in this country since 1986 yet this travesty is. Animator Ralph Bakshi cut his teeth with Paul Terry and Terrytoons but gained personal fame with commercial animated porn i.e. ""Fritz the Cat"". In a word this film is an abomination. It's a visual and aural assault to the senses. The images are ugly to the extreme and the narrative is incoherent. It purports to be a modern response to Joel Chandler Harris and Walt Disney but only reinforces what consummate artists those gentlemen were. The Seventies were a watershed time for African-Americans in cinema. This film makes a mockery of the positive inroads that Blacks made in the medium. There is a distinction between blaxploitation and exploitation and this garbage falls in the latter category."
1,Coonskin DVD Is A Bootleg,"This is not a review of the movie, but instead of the DVD release. The version being sold is by a company called Blax, & is NOT authorized by the license holder (Xenon Films) or Ralph Bakshi (the director). This has been confirmed by Bakshi himself on his forum. This copy is a transfer of the VHS version that was distributed 15 or 20 years ago, & the DVD has picture scrolling (a common problem of VHS tapes). The cover is a computer printout in a thin case, cut very badly, & the disc itself looks like it has been printed by a dye sublimation printer. I bought a copy for $6 off Ebay & while I am glad I own a copy of this movie, I am definitely hoping this gets released properly at some point in the future (crosses fingers for a widescreen, uncut version). In summary, if you really want this movie please shop around before dropping real money on a bootleg."
4,This drill delivers,"I'm a home woodworker and needed a little more power than the 9.6v and 12v cordless drills I've owned for years. But I didn't need overkill, either. This DeWalt 14.4v has done an admirable job. True, some other brands may have more torque, but they weigh a ton. This drill won't break your arm if you're installing overhead panels or braces at arm's length at the top of a ladder. All in all, I can't find much wrong with it. the only reason I didn't give it five stars is that DeWalt will probably go to its XRP design in the near future and this one may not be available for long. But an XRP will run you at least $50 more. If you need reasonable power at reasonable weight, this drill will do the job."
5,You haven't truly heard what music is until.....,"You've heard ""HOT"" by the Squirrel Nut Zippers. This CD offers variety to keep the listener interested, as well as a carefree style of music that is completely underestimated in our society today. This was the CD that first got me interested in this style of music, and I've been hooked to it and all that it entails ever since."
1,Fergie's book,"A distinctly average book, by a very average man. Nothing special here at all. Go for something worthwhile like David Beckham's book. Or the Tweenies...."
4,Maaajjiic,"Where is volume 2!!!. A lot has happened since 1999 / 2000, would be great to here the end of the Van Nistelroy story, more Champions League. C'mon Mr Ferguson, we r waiting."
3,"Nice artwork, poor quality control, thin bibliography","The graphics (and overall production values) for this volume are top notch. However, I've found numerous glaring typographical errors (mostly involving dates), which seem pretty bad for something intended as a condensed historical reference.Inevitably, much of the historical gloss is severely simplified. A substantial bibliography would have been of great value. However, the ""Selected Bibliography"" is really limited."
4,Useful and fascinating,"I use this as a reference in my work as an editor; it's certainly more helpful than a standard atlas if you're working with texts that need to be explained in historical context--e.g., Polish nationalism in the 19th century. But it's also one of those books that you can easily get lost in and then wonder what happened to the last two hours (while, in my case, I should have been editing)."
2,can't really recommend this film...,"Bought this video because of the very promising cast.Perhaps it was the sound quality, or maybe it was too English for these American ears, but not a little of was difficult to follow, and I actually gave up before getting to the end."
3,VERY INFORMATIVE BOOK ON SHOTSHELL RELOADING,I FOUND THE BOOK INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE. It needs to cover a broader range of recipe data. It needs detailed information on sabots and slug reloading and recipes therefor.
4,Reloading for Shotgunners,"This book is a fantastic starter or a great review piece as for me. I reloaded all forms of ammunition as a kid with my dad, but felt that after 20 - 30 years I needed a solid review of the process before beginning to reload again. This book will take you completely through the process, as well as offering a wealth of related information. A GREAT BUY!!Use the link below to get to new and used versions of this bookReloading for Shotgunners"
4,"Shop-Vac 906-67 Type A All Around Collection Bag, 3-Pack",lost count of repeated times we've purchased this item / very good product quality / buying household stuff through AMAZON is very convenient and reliable ...
4,Works as advertised,It's a vacuum cleaner bag. It works pretty much the way it's supposed to. I need six more words here.
5,All Around Shop Vac bags,I could no longer find the bag in stores. This was it. Great buy and I can keep using my small ShopVac
2,Don't waste your money,"If this author is Bulgarian, then it's easy to see the differences in communication. Difficult at best. You cannot just listen to the CD; you must correlate with he book. Mariana (Author), why don't you say the corresponding word in english??? Also, only some words are translated phonetically into English, which is what helps the most when learning a language like this with a completely different alphabet. I've learned some from this book but I attribute this only to my dilligence. The best part of the book is the first few pages where they talk about custom and history."
3,Must know the cyrillic alphabet ......,"If you do not know the alphabet, you will not do well with this book. What I like most about it is that one of the voices on the CDs is of a friend of mine.All of the phrases are written in Bulgarian and then in English. Therefore, if you just want to use the book and listen to the CDs later, you will most likely be lost.For future publications or for others who want to publish something similar - Please include transcribtions!Another product you may like is the pocket Bulgarian Phrase book - it has transcribtions in it."
3,Good introduction - poor exercise physiology,"This DVD does provide a good introduction to some basic kettlebell exercises, and the kettlebell can be an excellent training tool.As a physical therapist, however, I am concerned that proper form is not explained or emphasized well, and in fact she gives some instructions I find potentially dangerous - such as ""lock out the knee"". I'd be very interested to learn what sort of exercise physiology background, if any, she has. I looked on her website and it seems like she's a smart woman who saw a good way to make money - perhaps without a good depth of A&P; knowledge.My professional opinion would be that this DVD is appropriate for people who are reasonably fit, have worked out before and understand some basic tenets of exercise physiolgy, and do not have knee or back problems.I will add that her website sells the DVD for half the price that amazon is currently offering it at."
3,adequate,"This is okay for a beginner. The 3 circuits of KB play covers a fair selection of beginning moves. But the warm up is not long enough. Do some Hindu pushups and squats before beginning the circuit.There is none of the absurd ""comrade"" talk or the macho attitudes of Pavel's releases. Unfortunately the instruction for proper KB use is just barely adequate. For a much more in depth presentation of proper form (which essential with KBs) buy Steve Cotter's Encyclopedia of Kettlebell Lifting. It contains 5 DVDs and shows the proper form, done by a master of KBs, without the elevator music."
1,audio screwed up,At times her mouth isn't in line with the audio - her mouth moves too slow and it's annoying to watch.
4,New author makes a splash with this one,"The Bagots and the Godsols have been feuding for generations. The time has come for third son Rafe Godsol to take a bride. He sees the woman he wants at a wedding celebration...then finds out that she is the widowed daughter of his greatest enemy! Kate de Fraisney does not know who he is at first because she was fostered away as a child and thus was raised away from the hatred. Once she knows who he is, she fights her attraction to him. Neither one of them truly feels the malice and rage that began the feud. But they are influenced strongly by their kin: Rafe by his older brother, and Kate by her father. Keep an eye out for this author. She has the presence and style of a seasoned author."
3,A let down,"I was excited to try a workout by Jackie Warner as I have heard great things about her workouts and the results that people are getting. This workout was disappointing. Today was the first day I tried it and I did the 40 minute routine. I found that the pace was too fast, not because I'm out of shape (I work out 6 times a week and have been consistent with that for the past four years - I also run and hike 14ers) but because it was hard to keep proper form and complete the movements. I did break a sweat which is always a good thing to me. I was feeling the burn on a couple of the segments, but overall, I really didn't feel like I got the workout I wanted. I'll try doing this a couple of days a week for the next month and see how I feel about it after I'm done and before I switch to a new DVD. I'll add that I found that The Firm Bootcamp - Maximum Calorie Burn, was a better overall circuit training workout."
3,Pretty advanced,"First, there is virtually no warm up and what warm up there is is very choppy. So do your own or you'll get hurt.Second, Jackie basically sprints through the exercise and NEVER says go at your own pace. She goes so fast that if you try to keep up with her, you will get hurt. Just remember, it's not about how many your do, but that you keep going, at your pace, keeping your form, until she says stop.Third, overall, it's a tough workout and you will feel it, which is good. You can add weights and try to go faster. It's a decent workout, that needs a better instructor."
4,Hurts the next day,"After doing the 40 minute circuit yesterday, I honestly wasn't all that impressed. As the workout is relatively short, each body part only gets 1-2 moves, but with multiple reps. I finished the workout, sweaty, but not feeling like I had all that great of a workout. However, I was in pain when I woke up this morning. My legs, butt, and chest hurt the most. I did, however, use heavier weights than shown in the video (10-12lbs). For some, I might go up the next time I do this workout.All in all, a good quickie workout. Harder than it feels!"
4,One tough workout,"I have Jackie's previous DVD and find it a challenging workout. This new one is, if anything, even more challenging (in a good way). I was sore for about two days after doing the 40-minute workout for the first time. It's a simple concept: For each muscle group, there are three exercises that you do for a minute each, followed by the ""power burn,"" which is all three of the exercises in one minute. Then it's on to the next muscle group.... You will definitely feel it afterward. I recommend starting with the 15-minute total body workout before attempting the 40-minute one."
3,Got bad knees?,"While I do think the level/quality of the exercises are very high, they are not at all ideal for people with bad knees. I couldn't even try to do 80% of the exercises (by just looking at it I knew it was NOT gonna work), and because of those other 20% that I did do, my knee is all messed up. Too bad.. I really wanted this DVD to work."
3,Not challenging enough,"This is probably a decent workout for beginner exercisers. For those in intermediate to advanced shape, it won't do a whole lot for you. The first time I did this workout, I barely broke a sweat. The 3 abs workouts were challenging, but that's about it. The second time I did it, I modified it Jillian Michaels-style by doing biceps curls, shoulder raises, triceps presses, etc. while doing the lower body moves and adding squats and lunges to the upper body moves. Now it's going back to the library. I found Jackie to be upbeat and encouraging without being too annoying, but she gives too little instruction about form. I would definitely opt for a Jillian Michaels DVD over this one."
5,Very Awesome... i am more of a fan now,This workout is very smooth and quick and i love the power moves at the end of each workout i have lost 8 pounds using this workout sooo far and i love this and its great and challenging....i felt my abs and legs working as soon as i woke up this next day it works and its for anyone who has a small amount of time and for those who have at least a hour... NO EXCUSES
5,Jackie Warner Kicked me in the Behind,"I just moved to my new home and haven't had an opportunity to work out, but when I was using this DVD I can tell you that I was sore. Eventually, I looked forward to the soreness. Jackie Warner's words while she's telling you how to workout are very helpful.Edit: I had to get this DVD again because it's so amazing, but my children scratched the first one."
4,Training Options each Pack Power - worth it!,"This DVD has very good options for targeted areas of your body, and over-all body work-outs. while very basic, they are quite powerful work-outs that have the affect desired to tighten muscle and reduce fat. I like this better than her other DVD because it does offer a variation rather than just one work-out."
3,"Good, but not a great calorie burner","I was so excited to get a new Jackie Warner DVD. I already own her Xtreme Time Saver DVD and love it. To be fair, I only did the 40 minute total body workout and have not tried the other workouts. I used 8 pound weights as my heavy set and 5 pound weights as my light set since there are so many reps involved. I did think the workout was difficult and a few times I wasn't able to complete all the reps. However, at the end of the workout I hadn't really sweat that much. According to my HRM, I only burned 133 calories. I did feel a bit sore the next day so I know it did something, but I'm still a bit disappointed in the calorie burn in this. If I remember correctly, the Xtreme Time Saver DVD burned around 230-250 calories in just 30 minutes and still used weights.So was this DVD a waste of time? Absolutely not, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for either. I will try combining some of the other 15 minute workouts on this DVD and update this review later."
5,Love!!,"I got this dvd before starting my junior year of college. I'm a small girl, but after my first 2 years of college I had definitely put on some weight (145 pounds at 5'4""). The first time I did this dvd I HATED it, obviously, because it made me work! I stuck with it though. I started doing this workout dvd once or twice a week, and on other days I would do cardio workouts at the gym. This dvd helped me change my whole attitude about working out and being healthy. I'm now finishing my senior year of college, I have lost 25 pounds and I am in the best shape I have ever been in!!I would recommend this to anyone who is SERIOUS about working out and changing your life!"
4,Best Cardio Workout!,"Absolutely love Jackie Warner!. I have several of her workout DVDs and this one is my favorite. The 40 minute workout goes by fast (this is the only DVD where I'm not watching the clock) but is hard - you will definitely feel it the next day. I've tried Jillian Michael's DVDs too, but something about Jackie's exercises give me results that I can't seem to get with other workouts. This is a must buy! I only rated it 4 stars though, because the volume on my DVD seems to be a little off (randomly getting quite when the volume is all the way on hight)."
4,Awesome DVD,"Such an awesome workout. My first time with Jackie Warner and I love her style, explanations and break down of the workout. This DVD made me sweat doing the full body one."
5,You will feel this one!,"I've been working out for over 10 years and this workout kicked my [...]! It's very fast paced, so I suggest you have your workout mat and weights in place and ready to go. Great workout for the intermediate or advanced. You will feel this one the next day!"
4,"Good, effective workout","I've had this DVD for about a year and a half and I do it on a regular basis. At the beginning Jackie annoyed me (mostly b/c of her cueing, not her personality), but with time I was able to appreciate this is a solid workout. If you're choosing heavy weights then you'll definitely see results from it. I do the full 40-minute workout and particularly like the leg sets and still find them challenging, mostly b/c of the speed that Jackie works at. There's very little time between sets to rest, which is the point of circuit training. I think that Jackie often varies her speed, but have learned to either ignore her or pay attention to the two other exercisers who tend to be more consistent.For some reason, it's hard to find a good workout in the 45 minute range, and this one fits the bill, which is why I'm still doing it!"
4,Feelin it fast...,"I didn't think originally that I would actually feel a 15 minute workout. I was wrong. This tape offers 15 min abs, 15 min total body, 15 upper and 15 min lower. In addition it offers a 45 minute workout as well. I started with the 15 min each day using a different section. I not only felt the workout in my total body without being so sore I couldn't move, but I am seeing the difference. I have done just about every new workout tape. I feel like you get the biggest bang for your buck. A few weakness is the same warm up and cool down for each section and she doesn't guide you through each exercise which may be hard for a beginner. All in all, I think its a great investment."
4,Great DVD,"I have been teaching group fitness for 16 years and am an ACE certified PT and buy DVD's to get ideas - I really liked this DVD. It is, however, not 3 seperate workouts - it's one workout but broken down into 3 components depending on how much time you want to put into your workout on a given day. I don't really care about music in a DVD because I am not looking to be entertained - I want a solid workout with exercises that make sense, are effective and challenging and this DVD offers it all."
5,Jackie,"Loved this workout, worth what I paid for it. Not for beginers. A good all over body workout."
2,Really disappointed in this workout.,"I was legitimately excited to start this workout, but it's just not that great. All 5 sections are kind of basic and not a challenge at all. I wasn't sore at all on any of the parts of the workout, so I would not recommend buying it.I'm not really a fan of Jackie Warner, she's very intimating and her workouts just aren't that great."
2,Too Easy!,"I bought this DVD because my sister recommended it. However, after doing Tracey Effinger's Squeeze for a few months, these excercises are way too easy for me. I do not feel it at all with 8 lbs weights, and Tracey's DVD is very hard with 3 lb weights. Maybe this is good for the casual excerciser, but if you really want results you can see, get Squeeze!"
5,Simply Amazing!,"Jackie is simply amazing; her motivating workouts have changed not only my body, but my self-esteem. Once again I feel that invigorating pre-season burn. I will forever be a committed ""client"" of Jackie's, and I more than recommend her DVD's...I encourage you to take the challenge. Happy workout!"
2,Dissapointment,"I am very dissapointed in this dvd. I see this woman with a rock hard body on the cover and totally expected to sweat and be worked hard. I did the 40 minute and it was not hard! First of all, she doesn't do enough reps, especially the second time around. I am not in phenomenal shape. I just lost a lot of weight--from 209 to 174. But I'm 5'1 so defintely not in rock hard perfect shape yet. This should not have been so easy for me but it was. Dissapointment and waste of money. I will stick to Jari Love's Extremely Ripped which is a hardcore workout. I got that for free on the giveaway table at my job. That I would have paid for. This I am upset I did."
4,worth it for variation,"I got this in a multi-pack and it was totally worth it. I like a little variation from my favorite workout (No more trouble zones--Jillian Michaels) and this does the trick. It doesn't incorporate a lot of upper and lower body, but it does get the heart going and enough variation and difficulty to get the body hot...and works out the muscles slightly differently that I'm still sore afterwords....great addition to the workouts I do currently...and nice to have a 40min work out...really be 40 min."
5,Love it!,"I bought this DVD on the advice of a friend and also saw it listed as a top ten excercise DVD. Just what I was looking for. Yes, it's tough but if you want results, you have to work for it. No messing around, gets right to the point. I was afraid the 40 min circuit would be too long but it went by so fast! I am still sore 2 days later but can't wait to do it again. Will come back in 2 months and update the comments! I am alternating this with running, so can't wait to see the progress and changes!"
5,I Actually Look Forward To This Video,"I mainly work out with Billy Blanks (tae-bo), Chalene (turbo jam) and Jillian. This video by Jackie fits in great with those workouts and I even look forward to doing it. Time goes by quickly, the exercises are effective and Jackie is great (not even a tiny bit annoying). I highlly recommend this workout!"
5,Awesome,This video offers many options for a complete workout. Again like her other workouts she focuses on precise movements to target the muscels and at the same time you work your heart (cardio). She is easy to listen to and understand without being over bearing. Good choice.
3,Feel the burn!,You will be sore the next day....or week. Still haven't been able to make it through the whole video. Only problems I've had though is some of the ab exercises really hurt my neck.
3,Good for beginner to low intermediate,"This workout doesn't really seem to be circuit training to me as it doesn't get my heart rategoing much even if I do quite heavy weights. However, it is a good time saving full body weights workout.I like Jackie as an instructor, her manner is good and the workout is fine.I think this would be good for beginners to weights but the pacing is a bit fast for beginners.The exercises are simple but the transitions are quick and the reps are a bit fast for people who might be uncertain of form. So I'm not sure who the target audience is.I would recommend it for : beginners - but watch it through first once and practice the exercises slowly first to get your form, and then get it up to speed.I do like the abs section - it's more thorough than the upper or lower body sections in my opinion."
4,You'll Feel It!,"I just received this DVD and tried the 40 minute circuit. It's a good workout that hits every muscle group. I would consider myself in good condition (above average) and I feel it today. PROS: Using weights, you can really adjust based on your fitness level. It's a high rep workout, so I ended up using lighter weight than I normally would for typcial weight training. It includes 15 minute ""mini workouts."" 15 mintues will not get you ripped, but on a really busy day, 15 tough minutes is better than nothing. She does a lot of combination moves, so you get the stabilizers and secondary muscles involved. CONS: there isn't much instruction. If you are not already familiar with the techniques, you might not do them correctly, which can lessen the workout and lead to injury. Also, Jackie is not as motivating as other trainers who have DVDs. If you want a good workout and know the basics, this is pretty good."
2,What happened to her following her own advice?,"I don't know the chronology of Jackie's workout videos, but I do know mine. I started with the Xtreme Timesaver workout and was extremely impressed. Jackie consistently stressed the importance of proper form and implored you not to rush through the moves, as it was more important to do the exercises properly and with good form (both for effectiveness of the exercises and to avoid injury) than it was to try and maintain a certain tempo (like that of the music!).All that good advice seems to have been abandoned in this video, which finds Jackie and crew rushing from one exercise to the next and, during each of the exercises, maintaining a tempo that I found to be downright dangerous unless you had impeccable form. It was nearly impossible to keep up, especially in the 15-minute total body workout.All in all, a huge letdown from Xtreme Timesaver, which I highly recommend."
5,Great workout - some different moves for a change!,"I have done Biggest Loser Boot Camp, Tai Bo, Walk Away the Pounds, Celebrity Fit Club Boot Camp, the Firm, Jillian Shred, - I mix them up all the time to not get bored. I saw Jackie's show and remembered being impressed with the workouts I saw. This is killer! I wouldn't do it if you aren't at least an intermediate exerciser. I commented to my husband that she made Jillian look like fluff at some points! ( Though Jillian, isn't!). It was nice to see some different moves from the other workouts. No pushups, yet great upper body work. Getting down on a knee then standing up for legs was refreshing (but really tough!) I have always prided myself on getting through the toughest ab workouts- but I still can't make it totally through this one - a first for me. I look forward to seeing the changes after this and cleaning up my diet for a few months!"
5,Fantastic Feelin' It Workout,"After reading many, many excellent reviews for the Jackie Warner Power Circuit Training dvd, I decided to order it myself and give it a try. I'm an avid exerciser. I normally do four days of a cardio workout and three days of a cardio-strength training combination workout but had gotten very bored with my own routine. I tried workouts on WII Fit, but found them to be not a big enough challenge. I find the Power Circuit Training dvd to be a real challenge! I absolutely love it. I feel so strong powering through the routines with Jackie. I find Jackie to be very easy to work along with without too much unnecessary banter. She does a great job explaining which muscles are fat burners and so forth. She really knows her stuff! I now incorporate this dvd on my three days of cardio-strength combination training performing the 40 minute workout each time. I perform the ab workout after my cardio workout on the other four days. What an ab workout! It hurts so good!"
2,Not impressed,"I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser. I decided to wait until my second time doing this workout before assessing how I feel about it, but unfortunately, nothing has changed. As other negative reviews have stated, this workout leaves you wanting more. It does not get your heart rate up or make you sweat all that much. The arm exercises, in particular, are severely lacking. My biggest issue, though, is that this workout is NOT for those who still have remnants of injuries--most especially lower back--or who prefer to lift heavy. The pace at which she goes risks poor form, and sometimes her cuing is terrible as well. It would have been better if she did a full hour but allowed for more deliberate reps (with proper form) and transitions that are not so terribly rushed. Now I have to figure out what to do with this DVD..."
5,Buy it! You will not be disappointed.,"Jackie challenges you. I really like this exercise dvd. She is a beast! I like her philosphy on fitness. She is aims to show you how to achieve results. I like this dvd for its muliple segments-full body, upper body, lower body, or abs-which is good for those who may not have much time. Buy it and do the workout!"
5,Awesome workout!,"This is a fabulous DVD! It's divided into 15 minute specific body area segments or a 40 minute segment that works out the whole body. 15 minutes is a short work-out, but once you finish you will be out of breath and sore! It's great that you can get such a good work-out in only 15 minutes. The 40 minute one is a killer! The UFC exercise in the leg track is really tough!"
4,Very good routine,"This is the first exercise DVD I've ever purchased, so I didn't really have a frame of reference when it came to picking out the right workout routine for me. I chose this one because it has different workout times to choose from. For example, you can work out for only 15 minutes or you can do a longer time. I really liked the routine because for the most part all the motions were things that I could easily do; however, even doing the fifteen minute workout makes me extremely sore, so I think I need to do other types of exercise first and then work up to Jackie's super butt-kicking exercises. I can tell that I was definitely working muscles I don't normally use that much. I also like the fact that the routine is easy to follow along with. So, I would recommend this DVD but just know that unless you are already pretty physically fit it will kick your butt at first; you might have to cut back a little and then work up to it."
2,Stabilized Oxygen,"This stuff just plain and simple tastes gross ,awful and i will never buy this again. They really could do something better about the taste,yuck"
2,Hmmm...,"Vitamin ""O"" sounds a lot like (regular) Hydrogen Peroxide.I dunno...Anyways if you're oxygenating your body, make sure to take antioxidants, *as ""oxygen"" does not discriminate between disease-causing cells, bacteria, & viruses and healthy cells, and will destroy either one."
1,I can't believe people are still buying this stuff,"""super-charged oxygen""?""reconfigured electrical flow""?Is there nothing people won't believe?That third line is mine, but I suspect that the inventor of these water bottles must have asked himself the same thing."
1,SCAM ALERT,"Any product claiming to give oxygen to your body is a SCAM! You get more than 20 pounds a day from your lungs. Why would a little in water do you any good.Really, it is a scam, and the store and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for participating in this fraud."
1,Awful Textbook,"I'm currently taking a course on Algorithm Analysis, and we're using this as our textbook. At first glance this book seems like a tome of information, and extremely thorough. However, once you start to read it you realize exactly how many errors and typos made it all the way to the Third Edition. On the bright side, the appendices cover discrete mathematics very well.Here's two samples of the errors that have poked through:pg. 7, has a grievous error in exchangesort:for(i=0; i<=1;i++)That's obviously incorrect. It should be i<=(n-1).pg. 50, recursive binary search:else if(x == array[mid])Again, that should be else if(x <= array[mid]), otherwise the code does the same thing as the previous if statement.So frankly, skip this book. It contains errors that even a neophyte programmer ought to be able to catch."
4,talking bats???,"Good, short story. It can be read fast. Makes a good tale for Halloween!Ricky just moved in with his parents to a new house. Everything was going well at first, until, during the night he heard a voice, and saw at the foot of the bed a mean small creature hanging upside down... bat!!!! .... and it talked!It said the house belonged to the bats and that they had to leave or they would regret. Now Ricky has to convince his parents of moving out before the bats makes him very sorry for staying.."
3,Very Best of KC & The Sunshine Band,"'Get Down Tonight' is the best disco song ever! Rest of album is mediocre at best. This has has both the original and 12"" versions of 'Get Down Tonight.'"
4,Fascinating Frida,"Was Frida insane? You will ask yourself this question while reading this fictionalized biography, written entirely in the form of a conversation her sister has with a psychologist. Cristina was the one no one ever noticed, hidden behind the shadow of her infamous sister Frida. What makes this book work is that we see it all through her eyes, with emotions ranging from hateful jealousy to complete adoration, often times bordering on obsession. The fictionalized approach might not be for everyone, but what I think it manages to do, is capture Frida Kahlo's spirit. With her injuries, rollercoater of a marriage, countless love affairs with men and women, inability to have children and self obsessed portraits; she is fascinating and insane. Often times the two go hand in hand.Originally rumored to star Madonna, Miramax has just finished shooting the biopic ""Frida"", starring Salma Hayek. I sure hope she can pull it off!"
2,Un otro libro sobre Frida: Bastante!,"El tema de este libro es tan ovio. Con el reviviendo de interes en Frida, muchos autores han escrito sobre ella. Pero el complot de este novela no crece nada para el lector. El premisa es banal. La hermana de Frida relata sus memorias de la vida de la familia al psiciatrista. Porque? No se. Parece un trueco a presantar la vida del artista. Pero la herman es tan blando que el lector se aburrida rapidamente de sus memorias. Es verdad que Frida vivio una existencia de adventuras. Pero la hermana no tiene razon a comunicar que ya comprendemos. Quizas no somos expertos del arte Mexicano, but este libro no darlos a nosotros."
2,disappointing,"I was interested in learining more about Mexican culture, as well as obtain a glimple of Frida Kahlo from this fictionalized account. I was disappointed. There was excessive vulgarity and a real lack of character developmet. Little more than smut."
2,Not what I expected!,"Frida by Barbara Mujica is a mean spirited, most unsympathetic impression of a great artist who, in real life, overcame enormous obstacles with elegance and class. I could not help but wonder if Ms. Mujica was airing her own sibling rivalries. I absolutely loved the movie Frida but hated this book. Only after reading it did I realize that the movie was based on a different biography. This one is a ""Don't read!"" LJD, teacher of gifted education."
4,Epically heavy!!!,"If you like your music slow and heavy with a side order of epicness then this could well be the band for you. Easy comparisons would be early Sabbath but without the hooks or the slamming riffs of Electric Wizard, with the mimimal vocals deviating from whisper to full on death grunt. With only six tracks clocking in at over seventy minutes it's pretty gruelling stuff and could do with some light and shade but for annoying the neighbours this does an admirable job!"
2,Would be great if the charger was user friendly,"This is a great toy, great concept.. but who ever built it made it impossible to recharge the mouse due to almost impossibility of getting the two charging prongs into the slot that is built for it. Poor poor design, but great concept. I hope someone makes a mouse that charges easily, and works well"
1,Don't bother,"I'm not sure why I'm surprised that this product isn't any good. I read the reviews prior to buying but I thought the negative reviews were exaggerations. (It should be obvious that it won't work on carpet!) Some gave this product positive reviews but they must have gotten one of the few decent ones. I have tile floors but it still does not maneuver easily. Many times I have to push it to get it started and then it works for only a minute. When it does work, it moves very slowly and my cats barely give it any attention. But then, that is probably because once it catches their attention, it stops working. It does charge in under a minute but what does it matter if is have too little power to move on its own!Bottom line, don't bother buying. It isn't worth the money."
4,What I expected,"I read several reviews of this product from people that gave it low ratings. What were they expecting? It doesn't fly, it does not clean the litter box. It does charge in less than a minute, and runs for several minutes. Because of its size, it runs best on hard floors or very short carpet. My cats liked it, and kept playing with it after the battery was drained."
1,Junk,"This was probably the worst item I have ever bought. The ""charge"" lasts about 30 seconds and I had to literally stand right over it to even get it to move. The clip that holds the mouse to the control broke off on one side after about 3 charges, so now it doesn't charge at all unless you tie it on with some rope. I'm still looking for a good remote control cat toy. This went in the bucket faster than I could have thrown the money out my window."
1,Pure Crap!!!!,"Too bad I didn't look at the reviews when I bought this piece of crap, because now I see that someone found out the same thing I did. Hopefully I can save someone else from making my mistake. You get what you pay for."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Couldn't get this toy to charge, therefore I couldn't get it to work! Cute idea-too bad it didn't work!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"Disjointed, confusing, hard to follow tutorials. I purchased this book so i could learn modeling in 3D Studio Max 3.0. I had assumed from the title that this book would be in depth study of modeling, boy was i wrong. The author touches briefly upon different modeling creation from games to cad model creation, nothing was in depth. Black and White Photographs that were extremely hard to see. My advice, STAY AWAY from this book and study the Tutorials inside 3DS MAX 3.0 you will have saved your self 50 bucks and much frustration."
2,Too general to be of use -- not enough examples.,"This update to Inside Studio Max 2 is simply not worth its hefty price. The book does not go into enough detail on any of the tools it covers. Further, it has striking omissions of tools that other books cover. There are few tutorials and they are poorly explained. My best advice is to buy Inside Studio Max 2 Vol. I as it is more complete and useful."
2,Not so professional,"If you send a CD along with a book - the files you claim to be on the CD should actually be on it! If you spend some time with the 3D Studio MAX 3 Reference Volumes, you will learn a lot more than you'll ever learn from this book, wich basically only repeats the same things found in the Reference Volumes. There are much better books on MAX out there - so this is not a good choice."
4,For those in the area,"A solid introduction to Max for those who are already aware of the area. This book explains the use of Max's wide range of tools in a tutorial format. Probably not ideal for anyone who lacks a basic understanding of 3D. This book could benifit from greater expalination of the way the tools are used. Nevertheless, well written with well set out examples."
3,Fairly decent compilation.,"This volume has one of my favorite One Way tunes, the full-length version of ""Music"" from their self-titled release from 1979. There are a few other nice ones, which the avid collector may have already. If it can be had at a modest price, go for it."
5,Worth every cent!!!,"I am astonished at the speed and responsiveness of this car. The features you get for the money are unbelievable!! With independent front suspension, 250MPH scale speed (With Tyco 9.6v battery pack), awesome looks (looks better than picture on Amazon) and the ablility to race multiple cars at once this car is a winner. I was so impressed I ordered another one."
2,"Looks good, but sorry to say, it's just not","I purchased this scale some time ago and have, from the first been disappointed. We never use it. It just sits on the bathroom floor, taking up space and offering us the opportunity to stubb our toes.Depending on whether I shift my weight toward my heels or toes, the reading varies as much as 12 pounds, which is, in my case is a 4%, difference. This seems a rather large variance and it makes it impossible to use this scale as part of any weight-loss program.When we first got it I sent the company a letter asking for a replacement (I had already exchanged it once at the store), to which I never received a reply."
2,Does not hold accurate setting,"After use the arrow does not return to exact ""0"" setting. Some times it returns afew pounds before or after ""0"" as set but never to the original ""0"" as set."
3,well-written but limited in scope,"Ever since Galois theory has been used to solve polynomial equations, people have been trying to use analogous techniques to solve differential equations. That's what the title alludes to.The book does not address what is known on the subject, however, and limits itself to Fuchsian differential equations which are historically important but not very general. The applications of group theory to this class is unlike the development of the subject to other ODEs.The audience for this book seems to change as the book progresses. The first two lectures seem to be aimed at non-math majors. It progressively requires abstract algebra, topology, and complex analysis. The proper audience is probably a beginning mathematics graduate student, but you wouldn't guess by seeing the elementary level of the first few chapters.For these students, though, I highly recommend it."
4,Take care with you DVD zone,"This serie is the most hilarious that I have seen from years, It was a very nice surprise to find it in Amazon. I boutgh it, of course, but I can not watch on my DVD because is in NTSC format and I am form Spain. So take care about this point but, if you can watch on your DVD, do not hesitate to buy it.Regards"
5,Unique humor that's actually funny.,"I first found stella about a month before the show actually aired. It was their ""pizza"" skit. I found it bizare yet pretty funny. The show aired on Comedy Central and I immediately loved it.Season 1 has sevral random cameos (including Ed Norton, which his on screen time was about 10 seconds if that) that are pointless, but for some reason humorous.Comedy Central claimed that season 2 would begin production based on the sales of S1, so PLEASE buy this, then tell all your friends to buy it as well."
5,Crazy funny underrated show,"If you're a little goofy, definitely try out this show!!!! It is hilarious and was cancelled before its time. Ten episodes of sheer genius (well, maybe not genius, but definitely entertaining)."
3,Funny and dreary...,"If you enjoy watching traditional t.v. sitcoms and dramas mocked this show is for you! The only shtick missing is the laugh track, which only make the show too cynical and acerbic, making it completely unwatchable, even for those ""in"" on the joke...Although I initially liked the show, but after watching the first 6 episodes or so, I found it to be, well...trivial and insulting. I have better things to do with my time than to be mocked. After a while it felt as if the joke was on ME! And not the general state of t.v. show production and consumption. Besides, its so silly it eventually became trivial, like a college football game where a powerhouse is playing against ""small-time university""."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Stella establishes a unique reality where the conventions of adult life don't apply, but since the characters' naive enthusiasm is the impetus for all the comedy, the jokes all rest on the premise of ""what would someone act like if they had no understanding of the outside world"" and it quickly becomes tired. When the 3 main guys try to riff off each other it's like someone having a conversation with themself because they're all playing the same character, and when they bring in an outside straight-man character for them to collectively riff off, the lack of chemistry between the Stella boys and the other cast members inspires pity for all concerned. Whatever admiration the show deserves for it's lack of adherence to sitcom conventions is overshadowed by the narrow simplicity of the conventions it replaces them with."
2,Not what I was hoping for,I like to laugh. This really didn't do the job. I was hoping for something monty python style. It has its moments. I've seen the one guy in the Sierra Mist commercials and they are funnier. I've read where these guys have done some shorts and they are better. I would like to find them if possible.
2,What happened?,"A lot of people will just ignore this review because I only gave Stella two stars. I'm not giving it a low rating because I hate Stella. I love Stella. Their stand-up and shorts are hilarious. This TV show, however, isn't. This is Stella Lite. It's like they took everything funny about their shorts and made them family friendly, thus making them unfunny. The only stand-out episode of the season was ""Novel"" and that was because of Janeane Garofalo's hilarious guest spot. Stella is great; this show wasn't."
4,For Halloween,"These were perfect under the short skirt I wore at Halloween. Just the right look. They are fishnet, so I caught my watch and braclet - just a hazzard of the material. I am 6ft tall and size 16/18 (thin legs and no hips)- they fit with room to spare."
5,Great Price!,"Great product! I love these. Very simple, yet elegant. They are even, sturdy, and well-made.Plus they look damn good to boot!"
3,not easy to wear again,"they fit, the problem is getting them off to launder them without getting them in a knot so they almost seem like a one time only product"
1,Not what I expected,"They looked nice. Until I wore them and they stretched out. I am 5'7, 135lbs and they still stretched! These are one time wearing fishnets. Plus, the quality is poor. Minus a star for that."
3,So....,These were appealing to me. I don't know what I am going to do with them yet but here they are!
5,one size fits all,"look great on my gf, legs wrapped in that sexy lace with all the points of access assessable. what you see is what you get."
5,Garrity Rechargable Flashlight,"This is a very convenient flashlight, when kept plugged in always provides a light when needed. Good experience with receiving this product in a timely manner."
2,Garrity Rechargable Flashlight,"It is about 1/2 the size, and 2 batteries only, of the 4 battery light I thought I was replacing. I probably did not read the fine print but that big difference was not apparent."
1,Didn't work when needed,"This flashlight had been plugged in for three years, and didn't work last week in a power failure when we needed it. Candles did not fail, though. We stocked up on more flashlights for any other blackouts this winter."
1,Piece of overpriced trash,This is a poor excuse for a rechargeable flashlight. It will stay lit for less than 10 minutes max. I bought 2 of them and they are both junk. Do not buy Garrity rechargeables.Garrity Industries E300G Power Failure Rechargeable Flashlight
3,poor performer,"I have had an Eveready rechargeable flashlight for years that worked beautifully until it broke. I tried to find another one and found that it was discontinued, so I bought this one. It was cheap and built that way. It holds a charge for a good while, but the biggest drawback is the paltry light it shines and the shadows in the beam. Good for emergencies, but not as a ""go to"" lightsource."
3,Garrity Industris rechargeable flashlight,The lights work as stated. I had one of these lights before and was pleased with it. Hoping this one last as long.
3,good but delicate,This flashlight performs well but one drop and forget it. We have gone through 2 of them and I feel it should be built to withstand a single drop on linoleum. I will change brands this time.
1,Very Unreliable,"This product would be great if it works as designed. However, the Flashlight's rechargable batteries went out after a few months if usage. Bought another one afterward and it broke again in about the same duration."
5,Great Dark Ambient Album!,"I heard about this album in a horror magazine, and being a fan of Lovecraft's work, I had to get it. I was NOT dissapointed. The album is almost entirely instrumental, and a must-have for any fans of the genre."
1,Poisoned Dreams~ The Unquiet Void,The content of this cd does not relate to music in any manner.What it does have is over 70 minutes of noise.If sound sampling of this cd would have been offered I would not have considered it.
4,Blast from the Future,"This is a fun read and Libby is a different character type for Nora. She is not an entertainer or business woman. Usually, Nora Roberts places strong emphasis on family relationships and this holds true in this duo as well. there is a sequel called Times Change.The futuristic elements make the story very interesting to go back and read now as technology continues to move forward.macanne@gte.net"
4,Time travel,"I enjoyed the series, predictable but fun. A prequel to the Eve books in a way and I love that series"
2,not my favorite,"I have followed Nora from her beginnings, and this set is one of them. You can see the set up is very similar to her writing style, just not as detailed out."
2,Overpriced,It's highly ludicrous that this book is available in an omnibus for 11.99 in a print version and there is no kindle edition! However what they have made available is each book in the omnibus for the ridiculous price of 6.99 each! That's more than the print version and it's not even a new release!
4,good overview and nice detail information,"This book offers a very nice overview for multiplayer game developers. It is split in three parts: First part has about 10 articles answering the question, what people play multiplayer and how to bind them. Second part contains about 15 articles about the technical aspects such as how to reduce message transfer with thousands of players to 1-2kB per second. The third part describes how marketing can be done.Very nice book !The only thing is that there is no red line between the articles, since every article was written by independent author."
3,it is not a book for developers,"there is very little detailed technical content in this book -- i mean, if you are a software developer, then a lot of this feels like fluff. i wanted a leg up on coding, and this isn't that book. it does provide a certain high-level overview, but it's not sufficient for ""game development."" for example, the discussions of server architect are interesting, but largely represent a kind of ""we did this and were successful"" summaries. if you wanted to move into this field, this book isn't an ""open sesame."" if you haven't thought much about the field and just want to get a feel for what the issues are, then the text is interesting but expensive."
5,Told me what I wanted,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE SAME REVIEW AS THE SEQUELS BOOK, THAT IS BECAUSE I CONSIDER THEM TO BE EQUALLY AS GOOD AS EACH OTHER.DON'T BUY ONE BOOK, GET THEM BOTH.As a games programmer I wanted to branch out into a MMG and this book was one of 4 that taught me everything I wanted to know.This book is split into 3 main sections; each section has several chapters about differant aspects of the MMP's. If you have any interest in MMP games you cannot help but to find most chapters helpful.I will admit that some chapters bored me and I skipped them, but the amount of helpful chapters there were more than made up for it.Each chapter has been written by a differant person and quick searches on google makes you realise that these people really do know their particular areas of expertise.James"
3,The Shiny Pullover,"The quality of this fleece pullover is very good. The stitching is strong and durable and its fleece lining offers warm comfort. I love the Bears logo which is stitched superbly, and the authentic NFL patches.But watch the size you order! These pullovers are designed for the baggy clothes lover, not someone looking for a properly sized article of clothing. I ordered a large which Amazon claimed had 34-35 sleeves. More like 36-38! It is more in line with an extra large. But if you wear droopy jeans and timberlands you'll love its oversized feel. It also has a shiny exterior which stains easily so beware (it is more for looks than playing football).Overall, a quality product that is worth the money."
2,Disappointing if you are an Indian...,"Just does not taste right. To their credit, plenty of mushrooms in the pack. But the quantity can be just enough for one.Will not buy again."
2,"Not so much a review, more a warning","Just to let other shoppers know that the 4 titles on this DVD release are also available on Fright Night - 10 Movies, so don't order both!"
1,Doesn't fit anything I needed it for,"I bought this adapter looking for something to hook my Bosch table saw and my Bosch router table to my Shop-Vac. Unfortunately, both tools have outlets the same size as the large end of this adapter, and it won't fit. It looks like this adapter is designed to hook a 2.5"" shop-vac hose to a variety of small tool dust ports. I needed something to hook my large tool ports to my small shop vac. This adapter won't do it."
1,"Not very good as a ""tool"" adapter","Based on the shape, you might expect that this would be sized to fit *inside* of power tool dust collection ports. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The steps seem to be designed so that each one has an *outside* diameter that matches a standard size, plus there's no taper to the steps which makes it unlikely to fit anything except hoses. If it's intended to only be used to adapt to other hose sizes, then it shouldn't be advertised as a tool adapter.I'd recommend the Fein, they did a better job of thinking this through.Fein 921072K13 Step Adaptor"
5,Life Saver,"This gizmo linking my Porter Cable sander to my Rigid shop vac is a Godsend. Instead of hoovering a ton of spackle into my lungs, this thing probably saved me a trip to the emergency room."
3,good fun and exciting action,"Errol Flynn is his usual devil may care self and gives a performance that is pure fun to watch, almost as good as The Adventures of Robin Hood. Maureen O'Hara is funny and feisty as the pirate girl who captures Flynn's heart. The fighting is amazing that no one was really hurt soing this film. It's great fun and I wish it was available to purchase."
4,A treasure from the Golden Age of pirate movies,"Errol Flynn may have been a tad past his prime when he buckled his swash in this pirate adventure, but the resulting movie, (co-starring Maureen O'Hara and Anthony Quinn,) is still a gem and it inspired a 1967 tongue-in-cheek re-make with Doug McClure called ""The King's Pirate."" Both movies begin with the stripped-to-the-waist leading man being given a shipboard flogging. Flynn's flogging ranks 27th in the book, ""Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies,"" whereas McClure's flogging ranks 19th. This doesn't mean that ""The King's Pirate"" is a better movie. It just means that McClure was younger and in better shape when he took off his shirt!"
2,Agustin Ramirez CD,The service of the provider was very good I give 5 stars but the CD was not the good do to the cut songs I use to have the record and I know they cut a lot of introduction and endingThank you. Shalom
3,Good vac but you can't plug another tool into it.,"Good wet or dry vac. I bought it so I could plug a power tool into it and hook it up to the dust port. I don't know what kind of tool you can use with it but when I tried to use it with my miter saw or belt sander it just blows the safty breaker.As a vac it's OK but since the dust port switch doesn't work, I could have gotten more power and larger diameter hose for less money."
2,Pagan environmentalism,"This is a very beautifully illustrated book with sweet pictures of kiddos helping each other and animals, cleaning up beaches, and planting flowers. However, this book really promotes an earth-centric mind-set, with the love of the earth replacing the love of God or each other as the primary motivator to be kind and helpful. While God and other people care about how we keep the earth and how we treat each other, it's doubtful a non-living entity such as the earth cares much about what we do. Great book for atheists, not so much for everybody else."
2,"Get the older shorter blade Fiskar Grass shear, it is much better","I got these after the kids lost my older fiskar grass shears which was shorter and all metal handle. Forget these, if I could return them I would. Don't get fooled by the longer handle and blade. It looks comfortable to work in your hands, but it is not. Your hands will get tired very fast and to top it off, the tip of these blades do not close properly at all. I was quite surprise at the poor quality of closing completely. Unlike the lost older fiskar grass shears that they use to make or is hard to find online or in stores now a days. This new one is truly disappointing to use, even with the swivel feature."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Save your time and money by avoiding these shears. Mine fell apart the first time I tried to use them. Poor materials. Poor assembly. At one time Fiskars would not have marketed this garbage, now it is anything for a buck."
1,These are junk...,"The blades spread apart while you are trying to cut, can barely cut one piece of grass at a time... Mostly made of plastic... Stay away.."
2,broken,"Our shears worked well enough, for a time this summer. They they broke in half. Not very sturdy, I'd say."
4,Good for small tasks.,"I have only has this item for a few weeks so I cannot comment on how well it holds up, but it is exactly what I needed for small jobs. The angle is easily adjustable."
1,Bad choice Lee Phoenix AZ,"For some reason, when you squeeze the handle closed to cut, they bind-up and and don't re-open fully. Very frustrating. . . as it took me 15 minutes to edge 4 foot of grass. . . don't waste your time, money on these! Lee/ Phoenix Arizona"
2,Not really an Encyclopaedia,"I have no idea why they call this book an Encyclopaedia, I can only suppose it's a marketing scam. For the life of me, I couldn't find the supposed 300 pattern & stitches. The photographs are terrible and in B&W. I did not find anything new under the sun and oh, the charts looked like they were made by an 8 yr old! In general the layout of the book is very unfriendly and hard to read. Extremely dissappointing."
2,"Good, but not Great.","This is a good book, but only if you are looking for lacy patterns. I agree with the woman who left the review just below mine, too many are very simliar in looks, & the photos do have something to be desired. I honestly do not recall what I paid for this book, but I'm sure it wasn't more than $5, w/o shipping & handling. I have to admit that I probably spent too much for it. Then again, in the future I may be in need of lacy patterns, just not right now or in the forseeable future.One good thing about this book is that there are 'drawings' along with the photos, and the written instructions, which I believe are helpful."
2,not that great,"I also like to use picture guides when crocheting-i figured if there are drawings provided, i would be able to read them. the drawn guides are completely obscure and difficult to read.The patterns themselves are kind of boring as well. nothing too special in this book"
2,Encyclopedia of 300 Crochet Patterns,"A definite let down. I purchased this book online because it said it had the symbol patterns along with written out.What a bummer because the symbols are handwritten and it is terribly done. Very sloppy pictures. On many they are so sloppy and jumbled together it makes it almost impossible to read the chart. I only read charts so useless to me.I am shocked that anything would be printed without professional diagrams.The black and white on every page is also totally boring and takes the fun out of searching through the patterns. There are too many wonderful books out there to bother with this one.It should be off the market.After seeing it, I wouldn't give more than 50 cents at a yard sale."
1,Sad,"Frankly, I cannot believe someone put time and or effort into this work. I bought this in a bargain bin (no wonder...) and it is a collection of various people wrecking morricone tunes. Think sound quality on par with those little donkey kong hand held games beloved by kids in the 80s. It sounds like primitive midi-orchestrated synth cheese. Do not under any circumstances by this."
5,great price on nice shears,great price on nice shears. replaced my old wooden handle shears with these. they are very responsive with rubber returns which make them work great and sharp.
5,Fiskars Power-Lever 10-Inch Hedge Shears #9177,"not the best looking ones around, but fast and cutting angle are more traditional like, easy to use without break in self training, edges holds up good."
2,"Cut like a dream, till they broke!","Looked at reviews online before I bought this product, and, although the performance of the product was almost universally praised, an alarming number of reviewers complained of failures (material/workmanship). Against my better judgment, I purchased a pair. They worked great 4 a couple of hours! Cut like a dream, and the rubber bumper that provides cushion was a welcome addition. Then, at about the 2 hr mark the washer popped off the bottom nut and the blades started loosing their alignment. Seems like the issues persist. If u/r lookin for a pair of ""disposable"" trimmers, look no further, but, as for me, I still have a few miles of trail to clear, so I guess I'm gonna have to test their ""lifetime"" warranty!"
3,The Makita Impacts are Better,"I have used both this tool and many of the offerings from all the other manufacturers in the cordless impact category, and while any impact driver is a welcomed improvement over the conventional drill driver, the Makita impacts are far superior. More power, lighter, more compact, and less strain on the wrist for the operator. My next purchase will be one of theirs. You can actually drive lag bolts without putting any pressure on the bolt itself, they drive themselves. Quite a tool. I definately recomend checking them out. I hear their 24V impacts will do frozen lugs on cars and trucks. Wow."
4,A lost cafe del mar style classic,"Phil Mison's track selections are identifiably as leaning towards deeper Balearic chill out. This double disc sees him at the peak of his programming know how and whilst disc 1 is slightly dated, disc 2 is still essential listening for any chill out, cafe del mar vibe aficionado. It's a forerunner for Kruder & Dorfmeister / Thievery Corporation type tracks. Disc 2 is a journey in itself and creates a 'thinking man's cerebral landscape'."
4,Steve Jobs of CableTV,"John Malone is to CableTV industry what Steve Jobs has been to the Computer industry. Look at the investor list for any media company. In many cases, you will see Liberty Media has a significant share in the company."
2,Dracula,Could not get into this one for some reason. Did not grab me from the start. Will try again later.
2,"Only one ""Cha""","Just not my cup of tea.....I never finished it but passed it along to someone who might like it. Only gets 1 ""Cha"" out of the 3."
4,Roller for Quads,This is a handy little device and great after a hard run or cycling.It gets in deeper than my FOAM roller.
3,I like the foam rollers better...,"I purchased this product after using the foam rollers at the gym for a few months.I like the way the massage roller is put together. It's quite solid, and I doubt I would ever have a problem with it.However... it sits too close to the ground to be useful. I mainly need it on my upper leg, but with as low as it sits to the floor, it is difficult to get enough weight/pressure on it. My lower leg drags on the floor even with effort to keep it elevated (which makes it difficult to relax the upper leg muscles).It really needs some more clearance. The foam rollers support my leg about six inches above the ground (plenty of room to generate pressure while relaxing the muscles), but this barely gives three inches."
4,Great product that needs more instructions.,"I was extremely skeptical about paying $60 for this thing. But my runner's knee had really been acting up and ice, heat, ibuprofen, and rest were not working. So I thought, why not give this a try. I have to say it has made a remarkable difference in just a few days. I rolled it (using my body weight) under the back of my hamstrings and knees. This was not a method that was in the instructions, but it seems to work great for my knee problem.Before purchasing, I read that other reviewers said there were no instructions for use. Mine did come with some instructions, but it was merely a pamphlet briefly describing the exercises. It appears that the company that makes this wants to trick you into buying their ""online training service"" even after laying out good money for this item. At any rate, there are some videos on YouTube that will explain it more clearly."
4,"good product, but could be improved","This is significantly stiffer than a foam roller and is really good for rolling out your IT band. However, the size of the roller is the draw back. A foam roller is easier to use because of the (around) 6 inch lift of the ground. This is more difficult to use because of how low you are to the ground. That said it soothes my IT band and works wonders if you do not like the give in a foam roller."
3,"A Mysterious, Beautiful Memoir","I read (and met) Mark Doty while I was in college. On the grass at Sarah Lawrence, I memorized his sad, beautiful poetry and read and re-read his book, Heaven's Coast, chronicling his life with his partner dying from AIDS. So, I was very excited when Firebird was chosen by my book club. Again, I found myself amazed and delighted by Mark Doty's use of imagery, but I was also disappointed as the book leapt from experience to experience without explanation. Maybe this is why I never felt ""inside"" his character, and at the end, was left feeling as though the chapters were more like poems, mysterious pieces of his life that were without resolution. Mark Doty is a man of great accomplishment, a poet of unquestionable talent, but after this book, he's still a mystery to me."
5,Great for in the wood shop,Works great in the shop for saw dust and wood chips.I does not clog up like the hose that came with the shop vac.
4,Easy to Replace!,"I needed a replacement hose set for my very old shop vac and this product fit the need perfectly. I really only needed the hose, but all the new accessories make it a whole new vacumming experience!"
4,Vac Accessoreies,Helps to allow other vacuum projects to be somewhat easier.More accessible to smaller areas in the garage and Grandchildrens playhouse.
1,I Can See Why I am the First to Review This One,I wish I hadnt bought it but I did so I read it and it is about as hokey as you can get. Not terribly familiar with JOe BAttens work but how many times can Mark Victor Hansen say the same thing - save your money
1,gone to come back,"even better ! jan de groot's first novel 'no shoes allowed' was so much fun ... all the characters ... the stories ... brought a smile to my eyes ! and now ... 'gone to come back' !! even better! the capturing of the local dialect ... the additional details and explanations of the area ... his explanations of situations, all make you feel as though you are there listening to his tales !! and his care to discribe people and their delightful idiosyncrasies ... what fun ! not only did this book bring a smile to my eyes ... but there were times i was laughing out loud ! EXCELLENT !"
2,Flimsy,ripped the second time I put it on. one of the poorest quality items I have ever purchased as an Amazon customer.
5,a necessity for current architects and architecture students,"This book is quite useful throughout your entire career. You can look up words in it like a dictionary or read it like a book just to widen your vocabulary on architecture. By using the exact vocabulary, your speech and writings will sound more professional and convey the message precisely."
3,more objective,"I would have liked it to be more objective and less judgemental in places. It's possible to do so and still convey the message that a design or an artist was over rated or not very good. But, this is only the case in some instances. I love rounded corners and the design and soft texture of the cover. A few more line illustrations and contextural outlines would also be nice. A good reference to have if you enjoy art and architecture or if you travel."
5,A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words,"We just watched ""Tantric Massage for Lovers"" in full and think it is fantastic! As a husband/wife counseling team, we were hugely impressed. It is beautifully filmed: set, lighting, and models who feel like real people in real relationships. Most especially, we loved the pace. The pace really invites the viewer into the magic of timelessness. We kept thinking of couples we work with and imagining how they might respond tothe DVD. It is one thing for us to encourage and coach ""take your time"", and entirely another for our clients to have the opportunity to SEE what taking one's time might actually look like. The guiding narration by Steve and Lokita Carter complements the easy to follow along with and tasteful visuals. This program is a significant contribution to the Tantra archives.Brian R. Ahern, LCSW and Holly E. Rawson, LPCStorrs, CT"
4,Tantric Massage for Lovers,"My husband and I had wanted to learn couples massage for the longest time, and are happy to have met such knowledgeable, gentle and insightful teachers on the DVD. The massages are powerful, and we love how the Carters show us every little detail. The music is very relaxing, the demonstrating couples sweet and beautiful. Overall a wonderful gift for ourselves!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"Cheap. Broke after only a couple of months. But, like the title says, you get what you pay for."
5,79th New York (Blue Bonnets o'er the border,so after looking at some of the comments witch place this book on the downside i would just like to say one word can only describe this book: GREAT!This book is most likely the most accurate history of the 79th New York Highlanders! it is i must say the best!if you need anything any little detail on the highlanders this book has it. from origins to medal of honor recipents.this book not only talks about their history but the feelings and courage of the men. men that i must say against another comment DID WARE KILTS! and i think if you happen to see it in a book store or on a friends bookshelf read it and as you do as said in another comment you will serve with the 79th Highlanders.
3,OK headphones for the price,"7/29/2011I recently bought a new desktop and needed a headset since my previous computer was a laptop. So in addition to making calls and using these headphones while gaming, I planned on using them for everything from listening to music to watching videos. These headphones seem acceptable for the former but I was disappointed with the headset's performance during the latter. This is due to the fact that the high sounds coming out the speaker are too high and the lows sounding muffled. The headset is still definitely usable and I wasn't expecting something great for $10, but if you're a bit picky about sound quality, this headset may not be for you."
1,CRAP,"Don't waste your money!!You get what you pay for, and I bet those ""video reviews"" which made me buy this product are paid for by the maufacturer"
5,Perfect for Homeschooler,"My children are home-schooled and use earphones with microphones. The school sent some, but the quality is relatively cheap. These fit my 5-year old son perfectly, so I tried them on my other 2 children who are older and they work great! (I have since ordered 2 more) They are able to block out the voices of the other children as they use them so they can participate in their lesson with their cyber classroom undisturbed. The price point is great. The connection of the microphone is nice because it is NOT fragile like many others and it rotates up in line with the head band, thus keeping it out of the way, (and out of their mouths)! Thanks.. I'll rate longevity when we get through the school year!~"
3,Padding falls off easy,"The ear piece padding on these falls off very easy, making them hard to wear. Everything else works fine, but the comfort suffers because of the padding."
3,Decent But Uncomfortable,"It's an easy-to-use headset that does what it's supposed to. However, it does break easily, and the ear pieces are incredibly uncomfortable for long use. Get this if it's just for something simple and non-time expensive, but I say anyone that is looking for a headset to use for gaming or something similar that will take up more time should expand their budget and get something over-the-ear (if not wearing glasses)."
4,Great Value,I'm glad I didn't spend 2-3 times for another headset. I use it mainly for Skyping and it works great!
4,Nice Mic,"The microphone quality is nice and the sound quality is nice too. I can't wear them very long before it starts to press on my ears and make it a bit uncomfortable though. The cord is nice and long and the mic is adjustable. You can wear the mic on either side of your head. Pretty nice for the price. At first I thought the sound had no lower tones to it, but that was just me plugging the headphone into the wrong jack on my computer so the sound wasn't as good. Plugged into the right jack, the sound is just fine."
3,Decent but defective,"Decent, can't be beat for the price, but my microphone is very weak--the other side often asks me to raise my voice. That did not happen before. Headset however is fine, albeit the padded earphones do not really help as the springiness is set too tight and after a half hour your ears hurt from the pressure.My opinion: somebody wanted to offload a bunch of defective headsets. Not bad for the price, but not great either. I wish I had spent more money to upgrade but now I'm too lazy to change them."
3,Cheap Headphones with expected lack of quality,"I bought these to use with foreign language programs and they fit the bill. Unfortunately they are poorly constructed and very uncomfortable to wear. The description says that they are reversible, but in fact they can comfortably be worn in only one direction. The sound quality is not great so I wouldn't recommend for general use. Basically these are poorly built headphones that have a microphone, which is why I bought them.Also, it doesn't have a USB connection, which I did not realize."
3,Cyber acoustic headset excellent but not so good,This excellent headset microphone worked flawlessly for speech recognition on windows seven 64. It was So good that I purchased two. They were quite comfortable with long hours use. Unfortunately the connecting wire failed in less than six months. Was the connecting wire more durable I would unquestionably rate this headset with five stars but the flimsy cord downgraded it to only two or three stars. I would not recommend this headset to anyone.By gosh77
1,"don't buy, brakes too easily","Three weeks after I bought this headset, the plastic inside the microphone handle broke. I fixed it with tape, but it affected the quality of the call (people would not be able to understand me properly, unless I would hold the handle). I emailed the company and sent them pictures of it. they were really nice and sent me a new one. only a few weeks later the new headset broke at the same place as the old one. I emailed the company again and got a second replacement, which is now broken too!the quality of the plastic that holds the microphone handle in place is not good enough.if you don't mind fixing the headset with tape once it brakes and then hold on to the handle while you're talking, this is a good headset ;-)"
1,sound for one ear only,"I bought this headphone for an interview (using skype phone) since my previous logitech died partially(my cats chew on the line. the micro still works but the sound line was broken). Disappointed with this headphone:1) there is sound for one ear only.2) when I try to use the mic to make phone calls, the other side tells me there is always some sharp noise in the background and sometimes my words are repeated again and again like I am speaking in the mountain. So the micro is completely unfit for my interview purpose.3) small ear pads and uncomfortable for long time wearingI ended up using the mic on the partially broken logitech and the speaker on my laptop for my interview. The voice was crystal clear at least."
1,NOT for PS3,"When searching for headsets to use with PS3, this headset is in those returned by the Amazon search engine. Beware, it is not compatible with PS3 so you wind up with a useless headset and the need to go out and buy another!"
5,MY SON LOVES THEM,I BOUGHT THESE AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY 14 YEAR OLD SON. HE LOVES THEM. HE SAYS THE QUALITY IS GREAT AND HE WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.
1,Was not the correct device,"I thought this would work with rosetta stone as that is the search term I entered to find it. When it arrived, it was not a USB device and had to be returned. Return process was cumbersome and complicated. The description online did not mention the type of connection."
2,Microphone broken,Headphone work fine but the microphone did not work the first time I tried to use it. Unfortunately it was 2 days after the return time limit had ended. My fault for not testing on arrival.Would not recommend.
2,Low microphone quality,"I guess if you are a video gamer or on using the microphone intermittently is fine, but I bought it for work. I'm in Sales and on the phone all the time and people say they cannot hear me, that they can hear me better with the headset that came with my iPhone. Disappointing. Buyer beware if that's what you're looking for with this product. Acoustically I think the earphones are fine."
2,Microphone is Not Functional,"This headset/microphone combo was supposed to be used lightly with Rossetta Stone. I plugged the device into my computer(a Mac) and I could hear everything perfectly but the microphone was not functional. I tried it on a PC and it still did not work. The headphone portion of the device works perfectly but without a functioning mic I was forced to return the device. Other than that everything worked fine, but what's a product that only does 50% of what is advertised?"
4,Great for the price,This headset works great. No problems with sound quality on either end. I use it mostly for talking on Skype over the internet and have had no complaints. The only reason I gave this set a 4 instead of a 5 is because it doesn't have a piece to adjust the volume on just the headphones themselves. Still a great value for the money.
2,Not compatible with my computer,"I didn't think there was anyway that this wouldn't work with my computer, but it doesn't even process sound. Make sure it is compatible with yours before you buy."
3,They're ok.,The mic is awful compaired to some others I've baught. And I've baught a lot.The headphones do not insulate sound from the mic at all. So you get major feedback that annoys people on the other end.Or yourself if you have a audio monitor situation.
3,Acoustic Headset with micropone,After I ordered this item we changed our audio/video system and have not used this item to its full extent. For the cost they have been working well when we did use them and the construction seems adiquite.
2,Cheap headset,"Bought this for my father to Skype with me. The mic built in to his laptop was not very good. The mic in this headset is worse. May be ok for listening. If you need a mic for talking, try another option."
1,Not standing up to use in a school,I purchased a class set of the AC-201R headphones for my school. We are having trouble with one or both ear pieces not providing sound after about 1 month of use. They do get used about 5 hours/day but I did expect to get more than one month use out of them. I will look for a heavier duty headphone
1,Terrible cheap quality,"Out of the box, this headset was a disaster. The cord was folded but it was crimped (hard pressed fold). This caused the headset to only have sound out of one ear unless I manipulated the cord, trying to straighten a kink in the cord and sometimes I would get sound out of both ears. However, having cord damage is the reason I bought a new headset in the first place. Furthermore, my voice sounds terrible to the other person listening to me, and I reckon because the input/output cord are wrapped into one cord.Terrible product. Even if it worked out of the box, I doubt it would have lasted more than 2 months of use."
2,sounds went out,mic works greats but the sound quit on me 30 days after after I received it. I will not be ordering this product again.
1,Lasted 1 week,"This product may be cheap,but it is cheap for a reason.The fom ear protectors fall off easily and cannot be put back on.Plus,it stopped working 5 days after purchase.Dont be fooled by the price."
2,Not Impressed,The audio quality is a small improvement to my built-in laptop microphone which is my speakers. But almost anything is better than that. There is a lot of feedback in this microphone and it is very flimsy. Mine broke within 2 weeks of owning. I'm actually glad it broke so I could have an excuse to get a much better microphone. Cheap price because it is cheap. I recommend pitching in the extra 10$ to buy a decent mic you will be glad you did.
1,Absolute Garbage. Do Not Buy.,"Microphone never worked. This product is garbage. The ear phone part works, but that is the extent of its functionality."
3,BEWARE IF YOU WANT YOUR SPEAKERS ON,"Great headset, but this model uses the sound ports of your pc so if you want to use your speakers to listen to music at the same time of having the headset plugged, you won't be able to do so. You have to unplug your speakers to use this model of headset. Better use one that uses a usb port."
3,adequate for the price,"The product works, but is not for every day use. I have it about a year, and used it once a week, at most. After less than 50 uses, the mic stopped working.However, for $10-$20, it does work well for a while."
1,Microphone,Microphone's output to computer is too weak. So the other side peroson through the network cannot hear me well. I am now using it only for listening.
1,Poor quality - broke my Bose computer speakers,This is very poor quality product. The plug broke inside my Bose speaker headphone jack. Now it's impossible to remove the broken piece. It cost me $50 to replace the speaker component.Also audio quality is pretty bad and the fit is uncomfortable. All around a really bad product - stay away.
2,Poor quality,The headphones looked impressive and worked well for a couple of weeks but after a month of use to the day they started having trouble on one side. Eventually it just stopped working altogether. Lots of poor quality headphones have this problem because they are poorly manufactured. This one is just a cheap knockoff disguised as a higher quality headset. :/
3,An okay product,"It's good for the price, I suppose. Mid-range sound quality, mid-range mic quality. The fit is decent, though a little tight. Not very sturdy.The one originally sent to me had a broken mic, so I had to get a replacement."
3,i don't like it,I don't like it the sound quality is poor. I really don't recommend it to anyone! It is uncomfortable on your head and I can't stand to wear it!
2,Breaks and it's not comfortable,For the price point I thought I was getting a decent headset but the major issues I've had with this headset are:1) It's too short (for some reason it doesn't reach both my ears!!!) and therefore it's uncomfortable.2) It broke after 6 months. Design flaw.
4,"for the price,you can't beat it!","jeez!...i just got home and i saw it sitting there on my front porch.i just ordered it 2 days ago!!! i was expecting it to arrive next week lol.it has an ok feeling on your ears and the sound is a little bit low for me so if u like extremely loud music this aint for you,but if you prefer moderate sound its perfect.the mic is ok too."
3,Worth every penny,"I use these while on the road on an occasional basis. The ""over the head"" portion is not very comfortable except one place on my head. again for the price, can't be beat. If i had to wear for hours at a time, day after day, I'd spring for a much more expensive set."
5,They are so good I bought two,This headset is so good that I had to buy two. The sound quality is awesome and they are very comfortable
4,Good Headset,This headset works really well for the work I'm doing now. There comfortable and they have not failed me yet. However I did have to adjust some settings on my computer to get the sound louder and remove static noise.
2,"OK Microphone/Headset, But Nothing to Brag About","I bought Cyber AcousticsStereo Headset/Microphone, Ambidextrous design to use with my Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000. The good news is that you can use it ambidextrously, or on both sides. The not so good news is that the sound quality is just OK. I'm not an expert on this type of equipment, but if I had had to buy another one, I'd try another brand."
1,cheap is cheap,"Hello everyone,I bought this item at a great price, but the sound has been acting up. When I plug it into my comput I have to constantly adjust the connecting just to simply hear, not hear well but to hear at all.--- I guess you'll get what you paid for"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET PLEASE!!!!!!!!!,"So just to be clear I am not being paid to write this review, this is me personal review from me, myself, and I :)first things first.So to start things off I am forced to use the headset from the online cyber school ( this is not there fault that they give us the suckiest headphones on planet earth) after the first year of school, I went through six of the AC-201 headsets!!!! and all the headsets broke in different ways. summer went by:( and guess what, my school gave me the same headset again. so for the next 180 days of school I went through another 5 headsets... thats about one head set every month!in conclusion,pros: umm ill leave this blank:)cons: E V E R Y T H I N G"
3,Not Mac Compatible w/o pre-amplifier,"My apologies to the manufacturer for an initial bad review.This product is not mac compatible without additional equipment. Basically, most macs have a ""line-in"" input and not a ""mic"" input. The output from this device's microphone must be amplified in order to meet the signal requirements of the ""line-in"" input. The fact that it initially worked at all is testament to the microphones sensitivity - the Logitech that I purchased to replace it produced no input at all.I was not terribly impressed with the quality or comfort of this headset, but I think it's fair at this price.I do wish that the product literature made note of this, but since they in no way claimed compatibility, I can't really fault them."
2,NOT a USB headset - uses those old fashioned mini stereo jacks,"I write only to state that this headset is NOT a USB headset. Use caution when purchasing this item, as this product appears repeatedly in an Amazon.com search for the terms ""USB headset.""Instead, this headset has a pair of ancient mini stereo jacks, which are pretty useless to me. This important fact should be much clearer in the product title, description, and photos. I had to return this headset to Amazon, and I purchased another brand."
2,"Worked fine, but not for very long","After about a month and a half the headphones stopped working. About four months later the microphone stopped working. Sound quality was above average for both, while they worked. For the price, these are OK, but replacing them is a nuisance."
2,not so good,"The only thing that annoys me is that headphones are so small that it hurts my ears. IT PRESSES SO HARD, I cant use them.And I am skinny girl, I don't have over-sized scull or anything.And I have no idea how to make head phones larger. Please don't laugh at me, if you know how just let me know (:"
2,Broke in 1 week,"These sounded pretty good at first. Not mind-blowing quality but seemed like a good deal for the price. The problem is that the workmanship is shoddy. Within the first week, the plastic cover on the left ear came off (as is common in some cheap headphones). When I went to replace it -- gently -- the entire left earpiece came off with broken wires. I had barely touched it. I do not recommend. I have since spent $35 on a different pair of headphones whose sound quality blows these out of the water."
5,Happy i bought it,"Bought it to use to make calls with the new Google Phone feature, and it works fine.This is a sturdy gadget. Fits tight."
2,No in line sound adjustment,"For the money, it is a good microphone, but it is incredibly annoying to have to stop and minimize a game I am playing to adjust the volume because there is no inline volume adjustment on this microphone. I am looking to replace it with a microphone that has an in line adjustment feature."
4,Good headset.,"Although it is not the most comfortable headset, it is not too uncomfortable. My only complaint is that the ear pieces are a bit small; others may not find that a problem.I plugged it in my computer and it worked, with no adjustment necessary, that's a definite plus."
1,Not for dragon Dictation,Almost useless for dragon dictation. I get a voice to noise ratio of 10 to 1 (at best!). The cheap headset - microphone that came with dragon dictation gets at least 16 to 1. May be very good for other applications.On my play back I get a distrurbing backgroud Buzz. Again not suitable for dragon.
1,Very disappointed,"I had high hopes for this headset, unfortunatley as soon as i got them and hooked them up to my laptop i was hopeful, the sound was great, but the mic didnt work, after tryen everything i knew how to do the mic still didnt work, very disappointed in this product. I know i shouldnt expect alot for 12.00 dollars but for the mic not to work at all is a complete downer."
3,"Good Audio, Bad Fit","The audio in is clear as a bell and the microphone has great narrow-band reception but the headband is so tight I can only wear it for about 20 minutes before I get a headache--and I have a small head. The earpieces are comfortable enough, but the plastic is too stiff and the arch is far too narrow."
4,Let's see how long they last,What can you expect for a $12 headset? They are very light and cheaply made. They worked out of the box but we'll see what they are like after six months or so. No volume control on the cord which might not be a bad thing since this seems to be one of the most common failure points on headsets as cheap as these. They seem comfortable enough. You get what you pay for so they are exactly as I expected. They will hold me over until I get money for a better pair.
4,Good audio quality,"I bought these for Skyping. For the price, I am amazed at the audio quality. These sit on the ear rather than around it, and there's not a lot of padding on the earphone. However, the padding is some sort of pleathery-type stuff rather than just foam. I can imagine they'd get uncomfortable for extended use as in gaming, but for an hour or less, I have no issue with them. They seem sturdy, and the microphone arm hasn't gotten loose."
4,My review,Satisfied customer. I received the item on time I didnt know how to use it really but my computer seemed to know what was going on. Any ways I still have to learn more about the product but so far so good
1,DEAD - BROKEN,"Defective, or broken. Waste of $ and time, and seller never contacted be after my complaint. Will not purchase from ""Cyber Acoustics"" again!Bought a pair of these in Nov. They sat unopened until recently, finally got around to opening them and one side has no audio at all.I had a pair of these with just the one side headphone that lasted ages... really sad to see this product so defective. I'd refund/return if it wasn't so far past the sale date."
3,mic dosent work,"i purchased this product to use while video chats with my family and friends,the earphones are great and comfortable but the mic dosent work un less plugged into the back and they have no volume or mute abilities,i```ll use a different vendor for my next purchased"
3,it works,Had it for about 6 months (still do). Works well except that it makes weird distortion noises a lot.
2,Microphone lasts about 6 months,"As others have mentioned, these kinds of microphones break about every 6 months and then I end up buying a new one. I use the AC-201 for speech recognition (due to RSI). Over the last 10 years I've used several different headset/microphone models. They all broke after a few months. In fact my latest AC-201 has a broken microphone, 6 months after a purchased it. It has ok microphone/headphone quality. I buy the AC-201 because it is cheap so, it's not too expensive to get a new one about every 6 months when the microphone breaks."
2,Disappointing - lasted 1/2 year,"This headset should have lasted longer! After a few months of occasional use the jacks stopped fitting well - the sound would come out only after fiddling with them, pushing them in or out in a certain way. After 9 months, it stopped working all together. I'm going to look for a different brand next time. Otherwise it fits well. I like the adjustable microphone."
1,Never did work,"We bought these to use with our Rosetta Stone software, we never did get the microphone to work. Going to try another brand. Boo!"
1,Poor Description,"I bought this headset for son to use with his play station 3, which is what I did a search for this does not say that it is not USB. This is absolutely no use to me and since it is open I can not return it.... Waste of money"
1,Microphone doesn't work,"Using Skype, I could hear the person on the other end, but they could not hear me. Don't buy these !"
2,No in-line volume control,"At the time that I purchased this headset it was advertised, in the ""From the Manufacturer"" description, as having ""an easily accessible volume control on the power cord."" The headset that I received did not have this feature. The headset works well enough, but having to adjust the volume from the computer is an inconvenience, and one that I thought I was avoiding when I ordered this product."
2,It was great while it lasted,"I bought this February 2010 because I need a cheap pair of headphones with a mic for Steam. When I got the headphones it served me great. I'm not a audiophile, but I was completely satisfied with the sound. The mic was clear when I talked. The problem is with longevity. My left earpiece went out just in January 2011. The product didn't last me even for a year."
5,Great for Gaming,"I wear this headset for up to twelve hours at a time, and I've yet to experience any discomfort. The ear cushions are a bit small, though, so I imagine a taller man might have some trouble wearing them for a long time. (I'm a petite woman.)The sound is excellent, and the mic is responsive. It's very easy to adjust."
4,"Great headset, but does NOT WORK WITH MACS!","Headphones are great! But if you are buying this for a Mac, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS! Since the jack on the macbook pros is a line in and not actually a microphone jack, this headset is only good for listing as the microphone will not work. So go with a USB headset. Other than that pretty good headphones, sound quality is great, specially for the price"
4,Decent for the price range,Purchased this one mainly due to the price. As I'd expected the sound quality was fair. Not great compared to my Sony one. When I play games I can tell the difference right away. The sound on this one is sorta muffled. It is quite comfortable to wear though overtime I do feel like my head is being squeezed. I would probably buy something else bit more pricey next time hoping to get better sound quality and comfort. Good luck
2,Fizzer,Great for the first couple of weeks then the connection for the headphones no longer works 100% and has to be fiddled with to get sound. Disappointed.
3,Working OK .. Not so Great,"I am useing this head phone from past 5 months. It is OK.Pro:Sound Qwality and Voice Qwality is Ok.CheaperConsPlastic is of not so good qwality.Start breaking from Sides now.Size of Erapiece (Headphone)is smaller then expected, Not covering Whole ear.No control for Volume for Headphones and Mute for Microphone."
4,Pretty Decent,"The sound is good both in the cans and in the mic. Not great, but when I voip from the laptop most people have no idea I'm not calling from a land line. They're a little stiff, and can kind of make your ears sore if, like me, you have a large head, but I suspect that if you head is a normal size or smaller this is probably a plus. Overall, I think it's a better headset (at least for sound quality) than the much more expensive one I have at the office. It makes working from home much easier on weather days.Addendum: They broke after about 6 months."
1,Don't buy this,The ear muffs should be larger for comfort. Can't use them for extended periods of time because they hurt after 15 minutes of wearing.
2,Poor quality microphone,"the headset is comfortable and set up well. i got it for the rosetta stone but when i speak in the microphone i have to speak very loudly for it to even pick up my voice, making it impossible for it to decipher what i said. overall bad product, don't buy."
2,Cheap Headset,"This was a cheap headset it didnt even last a month, the mic first went out then the earphone part shorted out shortly after. Not worth the money."
4,No problems here...,"Only want is a more sensitive mic. You have to be right on it or your voice will drop out and whomever you are speaking with will bombard you with ""What did you say?"" a dozen times."
2,Beautiful headset with short life,"I was very happy with this headset - the price was great, the design beautiful, and the sound quality quite good. I used it with skype a few times. Two months later, I can hear sound only in one ear, and nothing I tried helped. Too bad, because I had grown attached to the headset."
1,Never worked,This item was recieved and never worked at all. It was new and still in the box but when you try to listen there was all kinds of static and the microphone never worked at all.
1,No techical support,I have this headset a while and it worked fine on my desktop. When I switched to a laptop using Vista the computer would not recognize it. Called technical support and got a recording that someone would return my call. No one ever did.
4,"Not USB, oterhwise OK","Although this headset comes up in a search for USB headsets, it's not USB. It plugs into the headphone and mic sockets on a computer. If you want USB, keep looking."
1,Get what you pay for,I purchased this to record and listen to my students read using an online program that I also paid out-of-pocket for. Their voices are drowned out by that background hum you would get when recording over old tapes. Now I can't use this for assessments. I now have to purchase a more expensive one and start all over.
5,Great Deal,"Bought this for my wife to use with voice recognition software. She has not complaints and its a big improvement from just using the built in speakers and mike. I've used it on skype alot and it works great. I've even used it as just a headphones by plugging it into the headphone jack from my logitech sub-woofer speaker set and the sound it good. Only get it through one side when used like this though, don't know if it has something to do with only only the headphone jack being plugged in. For the price I can't imagine a better product."
3,Not as shown on website,The item was not as shown on the website. I needed a USB connection and this one came with 3.5 mm connections. I had to return it for a refund and purchased the correct one elsewhere.
4,Looking in the $20 and under range? Get these.,"For the price, this headset is great.Mic - actually sounds better on Skype (according to my friends) then that of my old Plantronics Gamecom 367, which which was considerably more expensive.Sound - quality is pretty bad; you won't find yourself enjoying music through these. But hey, if you're an audiophile, you wouldn't be looking at $10 headsets.Now, if you're a casual gamer or a regular Skype'er, then these will be perfect.Comfort - not very sturdy; i thought i was going to break it when i first tried it on. however, if you treat it with care it will last. the ambidextrous design is pretty dandy, those of you who are, for example, used to the xbox headsets that have mic on the right side will be able to do so.Shipping was much faster than expected!"
4,Highly recommended!,"These headphones... ARE AWESOME!!! I highly recommend these to anyone. The ear holder thingys are super comfy!!! As i came home from school, i nearly screamed when i saw that package sitting on the porch! they work great! they are easy to use, and i use them to add sound to videos and record songs. to anyone who's been looking for headphones with a mic, your search is over! i promise you, you will not be disapointed!"
5,Great quality for the price,"Had it for several months now, no complaints. Very good bass response. Mic is flexible. I'd buy it again."
2,Nice while it worked....,"Worked well for about six months, then a week of the microphone cutting out. Today the microphone died completely. Usage of the headset has been low, three to four phone calls per week via Skype or Google Voice and headset has received normal handling/care that I would expect it should have held up to (unplugged, cord wrapped up and placed in drawer when not in use.)Been reading reviews of other headsets and seems like they all have their issues and the microphones tend to be the failure point. Looks like these type headsets might just have to be considered disposable, so don't spend too much and expect to get more than six months or so out of them."
3,After wearing for a long time they can start feeling uncomfortable,"These are great headphones if you plan on wearing them for an hour or less but after that I can feel my ear lobes throbbing and an uncomfortable pressure on my ears. The sound quality is excellent. You can position the microphone anywhere by bending or twisting it. You can also adjust the height but you can not adjust the width. I believe this is the reason they started hurting after a while. Don't get me wrong I like the headset, it is worth what I paid. This are perfect for what I purchased them for - chatting via webcam. If you are looking for a extremely comfortable long wearing headset you may want to spend a bit more."
3,Very good for the price,"This headset was very cheap, but worth it. The mic is very clear and has less background noise than most. The headphones are quite powerful and better quality than my cheap-o speakers.The only problem that really sets this headset back is the headphone size - they're smaller than my ears, so if you use them for a long period of time your ears will HURT. Luckily, the mic turns about 180 degrees, so I've gotten by by wearing the headphones backwards from time to time. I wouldn't reccommend these if you had sensitive or larger-than-average ears."
2,NOT USB COMPATIBLE,"These headphones came up when I searched for ""USB headset."" They are not a USB headset. Beware. So I can't tell you how they work."
2,Not a usb headset,"I searched for usb headsets and this came up- but it is not a usb headset. It has the two plugs- one for microphone, one for earphones. The description is not clear on this. This makes it useless for some types of computers that don't have the dual jack."
3,Good for short uses,"Works well when using Rosetta Stone and watching movies; good voice recognition with easily adjustable mic and good sound quality when watching movies/TV. Makes my ears hurt after an hour. The height of the headset is adjustable, but width is not, so it will squeeze your ears (and I have a smallish head)."
2,"""Can you hear me now?..""","No, they can't hear me now - because after just 4 months, this piece of junk headset simply up and died. Despite being treated kindly (no cats with chewing proclivities, no rolling my office chair over the cord, etc.), and used only infrequently, it just suddenly stopped working - the microphone capacity, specifically. Is it really so difficult to make a product with a reasonable usable lifespan?"
5,Great basic headset,"I ordered 23 of these for work. We use them daily for IP communications. They work perfectly and are of a decent quality. For the price you can not go wrong. They are not USB, if you need USB look elsewhere."
3,Great for the price,Great item for the price. Crystal clear sound & microphone. Just an extremely tight fit. Absolutely could not wear this for an extended period of time.
3,How long should a cheap headset last?,"I bought this headset in August. Didn't use it much until late September. Then we moved overseas and used it quite a lot through the remainder of the year to skype back home. People started complaining after only two months that they couldn't hear or understand us. We had to retire the headset. Plus the boom mic friction bearing gave out and now it swings uselessly around.Okay, so the thing is inexpensive, and it worked quite well - for a couple months. But wouldn't you expect it to make the half-year mark, at least?"
3,Ok,"Hi its,Okay kind of deal , Shipment cost me more than Product price , I was in need to bought it.Mohinder"
2,Get what you pay for,"The microphone is fairly standard, which is what I technically bought it for. The headphones on the other hand are pretty worthless."
5,Headphones,"I purchaesed these for my grandson, we have to do reading lessons on the computer and he loves themGreat choice I made"
2,Mouthpiece is not reachable to the mouth,I choose this rating because this fulfills only 1/3 of my expectation.Mouthpiece is not reachable to the speakers' mouth (Manufacturer should have the microphone as expandable one).Listener unable to listen what speaker speaks.Good point is headset is working really fine.
2,Bad understanding....,"Dear Amozon, thank you for this opportunity. I needed this headset for online classes.I thought I was ordering a pair of headphones with a USB cable tip.These came with two prong tips so I,ve never been able to use them.The top of the ad page starts out with usb cable headphones I just assumedthat all headphones were usb cable tipped.Respectfully,Nathaniel Williams"
1,This isn't what I searched for,I searched for a wireless headset for my son that would work with his PS3 and this is what came up. I bought it and it didn't get here until after Christmas and then it isn't wireless and you can't even hook it up to the PS3 so I wasted money it is usless to me.
3,???Connector???,What kind of connector is there on this set?You would think that connector size and type and configuration would be an obvious spec. YIKES!
2,You can do better.,"Hard to beat the price, but these are not real comfortable and the boom mike is inflexible and short.Still, it depends on your purpose. If it's for online meetings of an hour or less, a cheap solution may be just the thing, particularly if you don't want your employees hiding behind their headsets all day."
2,Looks Good Feels Ok But...,"I'm not the most technical person on earth, but i tried to use these on my Macbook Pro ""17"" laptop and cannot get microphone to work in iChat,Yahoo IRC etc... only hearing the sound audio from the MacBook headphone input. No instructions how to use with a MAC! not a happy camper by no means. :("
1,Discomforable,"Yes I know, that's not a real word, but I wore these for about a minute before I couldn't stand them anymore."
5,REAL,"i came across this book via a friend. It is one of the greatest books I've ever read. The way the author engages the reader in conversation and scenario is phenomenal. It is a must read for those who are of the so-called X generation, and for anyone who wonders what life is really like for the black man in America. The book is written in first person, which allows the reader to see the beauty in the flaws of the writer.I look forward to reading more of his material. Big-ups! Mr. Stephens!"
5,Awesome book by an awesome woman.,"Growing up in Maryland, I knew Patti in the years before she wrote the book and I knew that she'd do an awesome job. The book is full of feeling and the style is beautifully mastered. The story is very real and heart-twanging. You'll laugh, cry, and never put the book down until the very last page. I congratulate an awesome woman for writing a masterpiece. I'm not at all surprised."
4,A New Genre?,"Patti Kim has created a young girl who has to find strength in herself or be trampled by life. Forsaken by her mother who also takes her baby brother (in the cab called Reliable), she is left with an alcoholic ne'er-do-well father and must somehow figure out how to get along for herself. But she likes to write. In some degree that saves her or at least allows her to put her confusion on paper (which pleases her teachers). But she's creating herself as she does so, an interesting bit of originality on the part of Kim. Ahn Joo is a survivor. And it looks like she will triumph at some later date. Right now, however, she is struggling almost totally alone to stay on the first rung of the ladder immigrants must climb to find their place. What a fascinating character this young girl is. And her writing - how it sings. Kim is definitely one to watch for. I cannot wait to see what she will do next."
5,A fine first novel,"Patti Kim's novel is affecting and elegantly written. There is really nothing like it in contemporary fiction. Hopefully it will not be pigeonholed among ""asian-american"" novels; readers who come to it with those kinds of expectations are likely to find nothing in it that is familiar or comforting. The author engages in some rather daring experimentation regarding narrative structure as well as subject matter. It is a bold, surprising and somewhat disconcerting book which should be of interest to many different kinds of readers."
2,Disturbing portrayal of Korean American culture,"When I heard about this book and read all the favorable reviews on this forum, I had to read the book. I was happy to get my hands on a book written by a Korean American because our culture is under-represented. However, I hope that non-Korean Americans who read this book don't think that this is how our culture exists. On the contrary, I find Korean American parents, although extremely protective, very involved with their children's lives. They are always struggling in order to make the lives of their children easier.I had a really difficult time reading this book because I found the story very disturbing. And I was disappointed that I felt no resolution at the end of the novel. I commend Patti Kim for breaching such a difficult topic, however, I feel that she has added onto the stereotypical Korean male in a negative way. As Korean Americans struggle to define a role in American culture, this book, in my eyes, may inhibit this progress."
3,"Comfortable, but the legs ride up","But then, you won't see a line under close-fitting pants. I wish they had a slightly longer inseam. Then maybe they wouldn't ride up."
4,Bright as the sun !,"I bought these two and a AA size version all in one package at the Home Depot one year. I didn't really think that these lights were going to be up to the task of lighting up the dark.Wow.The sheer amount of light that came out of these is amazing. Truly a bright light to contend with. Espcially the 2D and lantern-they slice through the dark-and very far too! The only problem is that, well, although the outer casing is durable (sort of), the innards aren't very durable / non-shock proof, so watch out and don't drop them.I would sincerely recommend these lights to anyone, budget or not. Even if you have some of the best lights on earth (like 'Streamlight' or 'Rayovac's' new 'Sportsman' lights, like me), these are still recommended for their terrific oversized reflectors and great power. Even has a signal switch! Big thumbs up.P.S. - get the yellow colour-in case you drop these in the dark before you turn them on-easier to find."
5,The truth comes out!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well ladies and gentlemen the finale of d.n.angel has finally been released. Most are wonder exactly what happened after krad pulled the wedge of time after the 6th dvd and this just ends it all. I wont say too much otherwise i will spoil this dvd to good fans, but if you must know the ending isnt exactly bad. There were a few scenes where I felt as if there were strong emotions flowing through me, but after that it was just heart warming. We get to see how Krad and Dark were created and learning the truth about the hikari's and the Niwa's deepest secrets. I was satisfied with the ending of how the relationship ends with Daisuke and Riku and as a bonus ill even tell you that there was a slight hint of two special people getting together. Over all this series was just wonderful overall and I recommend this dvd to all those who have previously watched the other 6."
2,"The book is a mess, errors everywhere, hard to understand","I have no doubt that the author knows compilers, but the reader of this book will not gain much from it. The code samples are bug-riddled, the text has obvious errors, typos everywhere, sections mislabeled, and generally it just looks like it was a crazy sloppy job. Maybe it had to get to the publisher in time to make the students in his course buy the book? It does say ""preliminary edition"" but this is little better than a first draft."
2,Carelessly written,"Andrew Appel is a CS professor at Princeton and, reportedly, a very smart guy. He certainly has a lot to say about compilers, but in this book he simply didn't care to. It's written in a very perfunctory way and is skippy and muddled, nearly incomprehensible. Perhaps this book is OK for someone taking a course with Professor Appel, where whatever is unclear from the book can be elucidated in class, but as a stand-alone book it's gonna cause you a lot of frustration and ultimately result in defeat. Any other book (Muchnik, Kennedy, even the Dragon book, despite its being old, dry, and somewhat unsystematic) is a better choice, especially for self-study."
4,Would reccomend,"Nice unit. All the accessories are well built. The screen does not have have a good response time, has ghosting. The resolution on the screen is very good. The screen could be a bit brighter. But even fine details are easily seen. The interface is easy to use. No harder than using a phone. Yes, the ""Component Test"" section is almost worthless. Having the ""Tune-up"" information however is very handy. 4 channels are not something I have used. I suppose I could have got by with the 2 channel but you dont know and the color screen is nice. I have to agree the battery does not last and the charging indicator on the screen is not accurate. Overall it is a nice unit and would buy again."
5,A refreshing and wonderful surprise,"When I first saw this movie, I picked it partly because it sounded like one of those underdog types of movies, you know the one that is usually overlooked, and undervalued. And wow! It is a wonderful, moving and incredible. This is a great movie! Involved in the mire of running her own Tavern, Rachel Ward portarys Bobbie, a woman who is privately struggling with cancer unknown to her friends or lover, played by Bernadette Peters. A tragic and rather sudden accident leaves Bobbie the guardianship and responsibility of her young nephew. As time pases it proves to be in a interesting progression of growth on the part of all them, and a very warm and realistic understanding of love, acceptance and family. The acting performaces are absolutly brilliant and the chemistry between Peters, Ward and the boy are just facinating. Truely this movie is one that you should recommend to everyone you know and watch frequently!"
3,"Hard to find, overpriced! Too much$$$!","I bought the vacuum at Costco but then found I had to mail in orders for replacement bags at a total cost of $11 for 3 (including the shipping). No store has ever stocked these--not Lowes, not Home Depot, ACE, and NOT Costco.Costco online *used to sell* a dozen pack on the website but now I can't find it--they discontinued the bags? The manufacturer, Shop Vac, now wants $7.95 PLUS shipping for three bags.These are small bags that fill up fast and $12 for each mail order is a waste of time and money. Shop Vac SHOULD HAVE used a standard bag available at hardware stores, etc. But no..."
1,Don't buy from other sellers.,"I purchased two of this item Shop-Vac 90669 3-gallon filter bags,pack of 3.Sold by a dishonest,crooked seller on Amazon,who sent a cheaper low quality copy #360SW.If you want what you pay for ""Buy from Amazon"" Not sellers on Amazon, This has been the third Bait and Switch of items I have purchased on Amazon in the past five weeks. I will never buy from sellers on Amazon again,If I can not get it from Amazon direct I will not buy it.BEWARE!! of sellers like B & M Housewares in Brooklyn NY."
3,Not whats pictured.,"Bought these to use to vacuum out my pellet stove. Fine ash needs a hepa style filter or drywall dust rated type of bag. Those ase usually pictured as Blue or Yellow. They are standard white bags rated for medium filtration, not sure how well they will work."
3,Shop Vac - Amazon's quick service,"Not much to rate on bags for a Shop Vac but I couldn't find these in town anywhere. They arrived quickly - good, because they were needed. Unfortunately it wasn't something a little more fun."
5,A delightful book,"I read this story to my daughter when she was a little girl, and am now reading it to my 23 month old granddaughter (with my daughter sitting at my side and reminiscing about how I read this to her when she was a little girl). They both love it.The golden book tells the story perfectly for a small child (simple text, and not too much on each page), and is beautifully illustrated.This is a fun way to learn the concepts of large, medium, and small.I disagree with the negative reviews complaining about the illustrations, the ease of turning pages (no problem for me) and the binding (yes, the pages ever so slightly stick out beyond the covers. So what. The book is not going to fall apart).Bottom line: This is a nice classic to read to your child, and the golden book version is just fine."
3,Golden book-3 Bears,It is a nice Golden book and that is why I bought it. Golden books are not known for their sturdy pages so be careful. Very colorful illustrations!
2,Not at all impressed,"I bought this book because I wanted a rendition of The Three Bears to read to my son. I chose a Little Golden Book because of their reputation for great stories and illustrations. I was sorely disappointed in this one. First of all, the illustrations were very rough. They looked like something a child might draw. Not at all what I expected from LGBs. Also, the quality of the book itself was a disappointment. The edges of the cover were razor sharp and I was concerned about my son getting cut while reading the book. I sent this one back to Amazon, and they refunded my money."
2,Potentially a good product,"I received the above Shop Vac ... today. It was shipped disassembled and without the necessary nuts, bolts and instructions for assembly. While it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how this thing goes together I did have to scrounge through my spare parts drawer to locate the necessary hardware to put this unit together. I'm sure ... would have sent a replacement but I didn't have the time nor want the aggrevation. The vac has good suction (but certainly not 6.25 HP as advertised)It is my understanding that this is Peak HP. To obtain Peak HP the volt/amp input is increased and the HP is measured at the point just before the unit goes up in smoke and melts. Not exactly usable HP. The hose is very short and the floor vac head is not angled at the hose connection which makes it difficult to maintain flat contact with the floor. I gave this unit a low 2 star rating because of poor engineering and packaging of product."
5,This Unit Really Sucks. So Buy It Now!,"It goes together in 10 minutes and is made of quality parts. The stainless tanks speaks for itself. The motor/top locks on securely and is easily removed. The caster/wheels roll with little effort. The only thing I thought was odd is that the axle on my unit is about 4"" too long. I can cut this down myself and it doesn't factor into the performance of this unit. Suction is excellent. Hose is only 6' long but there are two extension wands to make up for it. The hose pivots on both ends so it doesn't kink up at all. This is a key feature, especially with a shorter hose. Highly recommended."
1,POS,"We'd rate this thing zero stars if we could. All the features in the world can't make up for the fact that it doesn't [pick up] anything. ... In addition, the hose broke on the first day and it makes a lot of noise for not doing anything. It has been nothing but headaches since we opened the box - poor/incorrect instructions, assembly steps more difficult than necessary, clunky, tippable, short hose, ambiguous cord storage, no tool storage, etc. However, as a trash can, it's got decent wheels and a nice handle."
2,Bad Switch and Motor Design,"I bought this shopvac - model QPL650 - especially because it could be made into a HEPA vacuum for construction cleanup. It was used outdoors and in my workshop and gave adequate suction. I used an approved HEPA filter with paper bags for cleanup of paint chips, sawdust, drywall dust, dirt, etc. and this vac worked as well as any I have used. The drum design with wheels works well and is easy to empty. The tools are the same as most other shopvacs.HOWEVER the red pushbutton switch began to misbehave very soon after purchase and would never consistently start or stop. A cheap/bad design which I replaced with a heavy duty $5.00 toggle switch. Now after two years of ordinary use the motor has burnt out struggling with a small amount of carpet debris. It will cost $78.00 to replace. I would not recommend this powertool."
1,Poor design.,"I purchased this vacuum put it together placed it in the centerof my floor that had sawdust all over the floor and turned iton. WOW, did I get a surprise. The air from the exhaust blewsawdust everywhere.I called tech support and they said it wasso powerfull that this could happen. Because of the poor designI packed it up and returned it. I'm still using my old shopvac that has the exhaust coming out of the top the way I feelit should. I would not purchase this vac for my wood shop."
1,This vacuum sucks and not in a good way!,"I've had this vacuum for a couple years now and I've yet to remove a bag from it in one piece. Inside the stainless drum are bolts and nuts that snag the bag just when you are about to remove it from the tank and you wind up dumping the stuff you just vaccumed all over yourself. Extremely poor design. Bag is so big and heavy that it needs some kind of additional support that apparently Shop-Vac doesn't think worthwhile to make. The most satisfaction I've had with this vacuum is being able to write this review. I'd give it zero stars if I could.It sucks well and is quiet enough but it still is a POS. I've had an ongoing problem with one of the front wheels falling off and out of the holes, even when it was new. I finally used epoxy and glued it into place. Wheels don't roll well enough for uneven ground. The lid tends to pull off when you try to lift the vacuum up. This thing really is garbage. Find another brand."
3,fast -- but...,"This thing is indeed fast. It's fun, too. I just have a problem with the steering and with the antenna. Because it's so fast I imagine they couldn't make the steering radius super tight (it might skid out or flip over if they did), but it is meant for straight-line speed and not for maneuverability. Also, the antenna is a thin wire encased in a plastic tube which is removable. I've had an issue with the tube flying off a couple of times and allowing the antenna to flop down on the ground. I wish the manufacturer would have thought of a more secure way to attach it. Well, it's fast, and it's fun, but it does have those two drawbacks which hamper it's performance a little in my eyes."
3,Regular FlashLight with swivel head,This is a regular flashlight with a swivel head. Black & Decker makes one for about half the price and it has more cushion rubber on it.
1,yeah it is true,Yeah I agree with that pastor below. I was very disapointed in the new Thompson I got. No were near the quality that they used to make. Looks like it will not last half as long as my old one. Its a shame too. I remember my daddy had his for 40 plus years. I guess nothing is made with pride anymore.I sent mine back
3,Music 5 stars; Presentation 2 stars,"While no one can argue with the music here -- which is simply indispensible -- this box set is a poor knock-off of the Classics of Jazz Ellington series (my guess is simply stolen from their cds!), eq'd bright and harsh and run through an excruciating digital filter to get out more of the hiss. The track order follows the Classics series exactly (even misplacing a 1939 vdisc session in the 1941-44 volume).I guess I don't regret having all the music at this price, but you do get what you pay for --"
2,Wretched Sound Quality!,"I bought this set after reading the rave reviews here, and assumed the dissenter who complained about the sound quality was an overly fussy audiophile. Not the case--if anything, that review was generous! The sound really is quite poor; it has a metallic, synthetic quality with horrible digital artifacts. The instruments are sometimes not even recognizable--in many songs the entire rhythm section is garbled into an unintelligible mess that sounds as if it were recorded in someone's armpit. The same tracks sound infinitely better on other compilations. I paid 84 for it and thought that was a bargain, but now I wish I'd just gotten the Chronological Classics piece by piece instead."
2,Poor effort at the same formula,"I guess its hard to top thier huge hit record ""Whats the Story..."", but this is the same old same old as what came after it. One or two half decent songs and some brief moments of the playing and singing - I happen to like Liam's raspy Lennonesque sound - that help the CD limp back to shelf instead of the rubbish bin. Don't bother. Good thing Man City play better than the fans here."
5,Oasis back with a vengance,"Great album, but then again I believe Oasis the one of the best bands in the world. Take a listen and wisk away to the brit isle.Oasis rules!"
3,the band sounds bored,"The melodies aren't really there and the extended rock-outs aren't really there either. What really hurts is the non-memorable lyrics. No Oasis CD is perfect, but this one is 100% forgettable -- bummer. It sounds OK, but that's about all one can say good about it."
4,In Full Swing,"Oasis have managed to silence their critics that had written them off over the previous three years. Heath Chemistry see's a return to their roots which will keep most of their long established fanbase happy. The album opens with ""The Hindu Times"" (number 1 in the UK) and then what follows is what you would normaly would expect to hear from Oasis. Yhe standout tracks on Heathen Chemistry are, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Songvird, Better Man, She Is Love and The Hindu Times. This album wontwin Oasis any new fans but it will stop the dedicated ones deserting them."
4,Best work since Morning Glory,"This is definitely the best work of Oasis since Morning Glory. After the erratic Be Here Now and the truly awful Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants, this is a welcome return to form. It features classic Oasis songs, good solid album songs and just a couple of not so good songs.1. Hindu Times - Great riff, great tune, classic Oasis2. Force Of Nature - Another fine solid Oasis song3. Hung In A Bad Place - A fine example of proper rock (have a listen Slipknot!)4. Stop Crying Your Heart Out - Absolutely fantastic, this is just a wonderful Oasis ballad, a true anthem classic5. Songbird - Good but short, should be better than it is6. Little By Little - Words cannot describe it, a true classic7. A Quick Peep - An unnecessary filler8. All In The Mind - Good, solid song9. She Is Love - The one that grows on you most, very nice indeed10. Born On A Different Cloud - Again, grows on you11. Better Man - Not so convinced but not bad.There is a secret track but it is dire!"
4,They're baaaaaack...sort of,"Everyone's favourite bickering, almost impossible to decipher brothers, are back with a decent album, a vast improvement over their last effort, the glooomy ' standing on the shoulder of giants'. i'll not give a synopsis of each song, you'll judge for yourself, but as a whole, it's a stronger, more confident record that starts out strongly but fades a bit down the stretch. the swaggering Oasis that i remember from their first 3 record ( i loved ' be here now ', although many consider it a disappointment ) only shows up sporadically on this new one. they at times sound like they are holding back. i was secretly hoping for a Supersonic: part 2 type of song here, but no. don't get me wrong, there is some really good stuff here, and i'm pretty happy with it..but i still feel as if they are not quite in form. in today's musical climate, however, new Oasis tunes are a welcome relief. Oasis fans like me will buy it and dig it ok. Long live rock and roll!"
3,Lacking a bit.......,"There are some great songs on Heathen Chemistry, but the album lacks some punch like there others.Not really as good as the ones before it."
1,* * * THE TRUTH ABOUT OASIS * * *,"I thought that after Oasis had stopped, that was the end, the nightmare was over. But no.NOT ONLY ARE THEY RIPPING OFF THE BEATLES, THEY ARE NOW RIPPING OFF U2.The Oasis single, ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" has way too many similarities with U2's ""Walk On"". Just listen to Walk On and then listen to Stop Crying Your Heart Out. Snap. Oasis were ripping off the greatest rock&pop band of all time, the Beatles, now they are ripping off one of the greatest bands of this time. Who will be used by Oasis to pay off their money debts next?I would advise anybody reading this not to ever buy an Oasis album and support yobs living off other bands to become famous."
3,not as good as anticipated,"You know, i was psyched when i got this, and maybe i'll come around in a year or two after i've listened to it a million times, but this album seems a step down.There are some nice tracks on here - hindu times, little by little come to mind - but it sounds more like a collection of b-sides and odds and ends. i thought ""Standing On..."" was a pretty decent album, definitely back on track at least, but this is not the return to glory i was expecting (and no, i'm not pining for another version of wonderwall...). Believe me, i'll be one of the first to pat the Gallagher brothers & co. on the back - esp. Noel b/c he's a genius and probably pulls most of the weight in the band - but i have to be honest and say that this album was less than i expected given their last effort. (and maybe that's a compliment, if you consider their last among their best)Still, not a bad album and obviously worth it if you like Oasis"
2,Greatest band in the world??...give it a rest...,"Back in the day, nobody rocked harder and with more emotion than Oasis. But this latest collection of Oasis rockers and ballards is thier most tired and bland offering yet. If the Gallager's are really so infatuated with the Beatles, then they should take a clue from their idols and expand their musical horizons. Who wants to hear a bunch of A and E chords mixed in with such un- inspiring lyrics as ""Hold on....Hold on ..."" hold on to your jockstrap Liam, cause you guys should get your butts kicked for this lame CD."
1,maybe noel should start doing [something different],"i absolutely love definitely maybe and morning glory. be here now and standing on the shoulders of giants were ok. but this album doesn't do it for me at all. force of nature and hindu times are decent tracks, but even the best tracks on the album are only good to me because they are vestiges of what i love about listening to older oasis albums....maybe noel should start doing [something different] if it will help him and his band regarner some respect and most importantly, musical inspiration."
3,"Er, this is a bit bland.","Sure its return to a more original soundng Oasis, but the songs just are'nt here on this album.Apart from ""Stop Crying your heart out"" which is the best song Oasis have done since Wonderwall.The album just sounds way to polished and fancy.Don't get this."
5,Great Album,"Great Songs. Heathen Chemistry is a great album with songs such as ""the Hindu Times"" and ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out""."
2,Oasis lose the divine touch in their heathen chemistry,"'Heathen Chemistry' was being heralded as Oasis's reurn to form after their experimental and dissapointing album 'Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants.' From the beginning of the album to the end (omitting the occassional apparition of Oasis's glorious past such as 'Stop crying your heart out), one feels that the band are trying to mask a lack of originality and weak song material with loud recording. Albums such as 'Whats the Story Morning Glory' introduced the World to a band that had the personality and the talent to ressurect Beatle influences and throw them back into the heavans of brilliant music; all with the rasp of origniality in Liam's voice. 'Heathen Chemistry' maybe the band's final ignominous slip into the shadows."
2,"Nice comeback, but they should of made more of an effort.","This is the album that made everyone realise Oasis are still around and are back.After two albums that they blew it with, maybe not musically but certainly what they were renouwned for.Which is writing the best rock n roll guitar songs in the world.So with Heathen Chemistry they have gone back to basics.There are some classic tunes on here: ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" ""Little By Little ""Born On a Different Cloud"" (should of been a single), ""The Hindu Times"" just does'nt ""quite"" cut it, but is still good.As for the rest of the album, well I think they needed a producer (and not Owen Morris) rather than the band just deciding what goes on the record, cause as a whole, its not that good.And really, just cause the band like this or that song, it does'nt neccesarily mean the fans will buy it always.The songs just are'nt here on this one."
5,Oasis are back.,"After the over over the top ""Be Here Now"" and the more ""experimental"" (at times) sound of ""Standing On the Shoulder Of Giants"" Oasis finally have realised where they have gone wrong and have learned from it.What they have done is gone back to making a great album which is ""Heathen Chemistry"" which contains Oasis classics such as""The Hindu Times"" ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" and ""Little By Little"".Its very refreshing to hear such a strong Oasis album as this play so well, with a new sound and a new and better line up.Although Oasis are'nt going to be the biggest band in the world like they were for a few years (when they were just new) again.They still are gonna be the best and biggest band around and are going from strength to strength as their live shows, and as this album shows."
4,Their second best.,"This album is Oasis's best since Morning Glory, and their second best album to date. The tracks rock like only Oasis can, and the fact that Noel agreed to let other band members write songs helped out, showing that Liam can do better than ""Little James."" Hung in a Bad place is my pick for best track on the album, though - it's brilliant.Buy this album and shove it down the throats of people who say that Oasis are no longer the kings of British rock!"
5,The Gallaghers get happy!,"Yes, the Gallagher brothers seem to risk a little irony-free sunshine on ""She Is Love"" and ""Songbird,"" both very sweet songs. ""Little By Little"" and ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" are classic Oasis ballads reminiscent of ""Don't Look Back In Anger"" and ""Don't Go Away."" I enjoy Noel's vocals on some of the songs- gives em a different sound than Liam's. Both are great singers but each contribute a different vibe to the individual song. ""Hung In A Bad Place"" and ""Better Man"" have some great guitar riffs. It's just a great album all around, second only to ""What's The Story (Morning Glory)"" (which, if you're a new Oasis fan, you HAVE to get!)."
4,The Campaign for Real Rock Celebrates Oasis,"Oasis have taken some stick for ""borrowing"" from the Beatles; put that cricket bat away, it's beside the point. Liam's writing tunes, and they're Fab while still being Gallagheresque: ""Better Man"" transmutes ""Cold Turkey"" and ""How Do You Sleep?"" by Lennon into Oasisville; ""All In The Mind"" takes the beat from ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" into laddish 2002 trancepop; ""Hindu Times"" roars like a classic Oasis arena anthem should, sitar riff mutated into electric guitar. If Oasis use the Beatles as template, we shouldn't complain. Great earthy, analog guitar and keyboard sounds abound. No-one's writing power pop like this in the new century; give ""Heathen Chemistry"" a listen."
4,An Oasis we've never heard before...,"A lot of people are calling this album a ""return to form"" for Oasis. However, Heathen Chemistry is more of new beginning than a return to past glories. I would argue that this is their best album yet...by far. Heathen Chemistry, unlike their other albums (especially the last two) sounds like the work of the one of the best bands in the world...not mere posturing (which the Gallagher brothers have perfected to an art form). This album feels far more sincere than most of the material on their previous albums, and suprisingly, the best work comes from Liam. His songs (with the exception of ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out,"" which was penned by Noel), are the highlights of this album. With ""Songbird"" and ""Born On A Different Cloud,"" Liam, for the first time, feels as if he is channeling the power of Lennon rather than imitating it. With this album, Oasis have become their own band--they have finally grown up."
4,Middle of the Pack,"Funny thing about Heathen Chemistry. When I first listened I thought it was a great album. But now, after a couple of months, it's just a good album.Most, if not all, of the songs are solid. Most notable is the quantum leap Liam's songwriting skills have taken since SOTSOG. Although one has to wonder if this is due to the production.In any event, this album does have it's gems. ""The Hindu Times"" is a great opener (Oasis does have a knack for making great opening tracks). And ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" and ""Little by Little"" are classic Oasis ballads. But in the end, this album will probably be looked at as a Middle Of the Pack album; not their best, but certainly not their worst. Just...in the middle."
4,Too bad you can't here it in NJ,"I'm glad to see Oasis is back to form, I only wish there was radio stations in NJ that would play this album. It's not off the wall greatness but I'can't stop listining to it for one moment.The music industry could do it self a favor and listen to this album, because rock and roll has been lacking since the midnineties."
4,THE MUST-HAVE ROCK ALBUM OF THE SUMMER!,"From the ""Street Fighting Man-esque"" crunch of ""The Hindu Times,"" the album's meaty opener and lead-off single, Oasis returns triumphant with their most cohesive and memorable effort since MORNING GLORY. From the lilting beauty of ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out,"" and bitter bleakness of ""Little By Little"" through to the engaging whimsy of ""Songbird"" and ""She Is Love,"" the Brothers Gallagher have delivered an impassioned album that's inviting to new listeners and pleasing to fans. A trippy spin with hooks galore, repeat listenings guaranteed."
2,When will Oasis give up?,"Oasis is no longer the band they once were. They fail to write any songs that linger in our heads for more than a day, and even the songs that do stay in our heads for more than a day are there because we are clinging to some hope that Oasis will someday return. That return appears to be fading. Everytime they release an album, I give them another chance... I think this was there last chance. They just don't have it anymore. Even the best song on here, ""songbird,"" was forced and beyond simple. I'm sorry to see Oasis go."
2,No Thanks.,"What ever happened to the songs!!!Oasis's first two albums are amazing as well as the ""masterplan"" that has some brilliant acoustic songs.Even Be Here Now (which is ridiculously loud and blown out of proportion) and Standing On The Shoulder of giants (Which has some great moments) are far better and more pleasurable to lsiten to than this.""The Hindu Times"" ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" ""Little By Little"" ""Born On a Different Cloud"" heak their are some great tunes on this album, they are just way to polished up and overly produced. It really spoilt some great songs.Dreadul album."
5,That's Rock and Roll fer ya!,"Come on! Let's face it. Who apart from these boys is really playing any bloody good rock music. The pap that parades across the radio dials daily is wan even compared to the mancs at their weakest. This may not be their best, but at worst it is another good bunch of tunes to learn and sing along to. Buy it and enjoy it for what it is. Really good old fashioned R'n'R. Good on yer!"
5,Best Oasis album since 1995!,"This is Oasis' best recording since What's the Story (Morning Glory). The album is a great mixture of rock songs and ballads. What's better is the fact that Liam, Gem Archer, and Andy Bell also wrote songs for the album. Noel however writes the best songs which include ""Hindu Times"" ""Force of Nature"" and ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out.""Now many critics have accused the band of constantly ripping off The Beatles and being nothing more than a tribute band. It's true that they are one of Oasis' biggest influences, but this belief is ridiculous now. First of all, bands can't help but sound a little like their influences. Secondly, Oasis could not of written five original albums that have sold well by copying another band. My suggestion is to take the album for what it is, great music and heartfelt lyrics."
5,"Homeopathy, the best health route for me, this book is A++++",excellent book and as always amazon's shipping is FAST and easy thanks you guys!
1,Staggeringly Silly!,"The lengths to which these authors will go to try to make a discredited 19th century belief in vital forces seem reasonable is astoundng. They invent new kinds of photons (""biophotons"") for example. And both have been involved, through the Office of Alternative Medicine and the National Center for Complementary and Alternaive Medicine, in pouring millions of taxpayer dollars down a rathole of research to ""prove"" such baloney! Why? Because it makes any kind of sense at all? No, but because they just *know* it's true! If the rest of govt thought this way they'd just fire all the CIA staff and hire Uri Geller to read minds! Too bad I couldn't rate it ZERO stars!"
4,A back saving little trimmer,"I would have preferred this trimmer had little wheels to roll along the walk like the previous one I had, but it works fine and is light enough to slid along the walk or use around other areas needing to be trimmed(but get one with little wheels if you can). Back saving and good for the older person who doesn't want to ""get down,"" well at least for yard work anyway!"
5,long handled shears,This is a very nice product. I had a very old pair from back in the 60s and I finally wore them out. I am very please with this product and the speedy service. Thanks
3,"Good quality, limited uses.","These shears are of high quality and are well made. The blades are quite short, however, and I hadn't appreciated how much that would limit their use. I had hoped to use these to trim ivy so that I wouldn't continue to destroy my lower back with this task. But I found it would take forever to do it with these, not only because of the short blades but also because they aren't strong enough to get through anything too tough. For just the right tasks these would probably be a good investment - small jobs where you need to extend your reach. Not so much for anything requiring cutting an area of more than minimal size."
2,"Good idea, but needs better implementation","Looking for an alternative to a string trimmer, I bought Fiskars Long Neck Swivel Grass Shears. I need shears that I can use to trim the grass at the edges of the lawn that my lawn mower does not reach. I found Fiskars Shears to be too flimsy to do the job. They work well for cutting a couple of stray weeds, but add a bit more grass and they will choke. After making a few cuts, the hand gets tired. I still use Fiskars Shears occasionally, but I wish I could find a better product."
3,I'd improve on the concept......,"These shears are okay for a person who has only light trimming to do. As others have stated it doesn't do well in thick grass. The swivel head on mine is rather loose and doesn't click into it's angle strongly enough to hold at that angle.In my opinion these shears could be greatly improved is they (a) added wheels on them and (b) they could be adjusted to a 45 degree angle, where the handle meets the clippers, as the angle they have it set at causes one to have to hold the bar so far out in front of you that it makes it ungainly to handle. On the plus side they are quiet, quite light for their size, and the blades are very sharp.I'm looking into purchasing an American Gardner cordless trimmer to pair up with the extra American Gardner extension handle which does, indeed, have a set of wheels on it."
3,Grass Shears,Because it is a manual product the hand wears out before the job is done. A electric shear would be an improvement.
4,works easy,"I bought this as a gift for my 80 year old mother who has a bad back & can no longer bend over to weed her flower beds. It cuts easy, sharp blades. The only improvement I would make is to have a small rake head attached to the other side somehow to pull the weeds away after you cut.I'd also like to see padding on the handles. They hurt (arthritius) after using for awhile."
2,Not Much Good to Say,Fiskars Long Handled Swivel Grass Shears #9210I really thought this purchase would do the trick - not so! These grass shears are awkward to use and frustrating as can be. Perhaps if there were wheels/rollers on the bottom of the shaft so the shears could be better balanced and glide smoothly over the lawn surface or the driveway - whichever! Trying to trim along a driveway or walk way with these shears is next to impossible - forget it! I do not recommend.
3,Less than expected,"With my type of grass, this pair of shears wasn't very effective. The grass slipped between the blades and had to be operated several time to do the job. Sorry I purchased them."
1,what a disappointment,"I had such high hopes for this edger but have been very disappointed with it. To begin with it's heavy and somewhat bulky making it difficult to operate. Secondly, unless you position the blades at a particular angle, it doesn't cut grass very well. Thirdly, although this would be ideal for someone who wants to develop his/her triceps, it's a pain to operate for any length of time. Even my husband found it tiring and painful to use. It would be better if it had a wheel at the base so you could roll it along while cutting grass."
4,A bit difficult to position precisely.,"These shears do what I expected them to do, let me trim around trees and shrubs without bending over or getting down on my knees. They work best trimming around a tree trunk. They are difficult to position precisely for edging a walk or bed. The length of the shaft creates a pendulum effect."
3,Handy shears.,I originnally bought this product to help me with trimming the long grass around my shrubs. I need to use a walker. I find them to be a bit cumbersome and not able to control easily because of the angle of the blade and the long handle. I did find them handy for trimming my hedges and fir trees. It gets in places hard to reach. Handy trimmer for this purpose.
2,Only good for a season,"With a great name like Fiskars I had high hopes for this product, but was disappointed. They work great at first - lightweight, great cutting, great angles, etc. But once used several times.....it gets harder and harder to cut grass, grass gets caught up in the blades, and if you happen to get a twig or wood chip in the blades by accident as you cut - one more thing to pry out of the blades. The more this product is used, the worse it seems to work. Not sure if worth the price to buy a new one each year."
3,A good tool but not for heavy use,"Its a good overall tool for trimming grass, in this case Kikuyu grass. It worked good for months and then after awhile a part inside broke. I did use it for edging the grass and I think this is what really did it in over time. If it were used for trimming the grass down instead of edging I think it would have lasted a lot longer. It is a quick convenient tool for light duty use."
5,Fiskars Saves My Back,"This item is a blessing for me. I've had major back surgery and I have difficulty bending. I still have to stoop a bit, because it's not that long, but it sure beats my getting down to ground level and back up! It's very lightweight, easy to lock/unlock and to change angles. I honestly don't like messing with power equipment so for me this is great! Was everything I imagined it to be...and then some. I'd surely recommend this item to others, esp to my 55+ age friends, family & neighbors!"
4,grass clippers,The grass clippers work just fine in places where I can not use the weedeater.I use it around some of my some bushes where the weedeater would tear up the bush.
5,EXCELLENT...EXCELLENT...EXCELLENT,I have a bad back that gives me problems when I stoop while doing yard work. I recently installed a decorative steel fence around my front yard and didn't want the weedeater to strip the grass and leave bare soil under the fence and I knew I would be unable to trim the grass with hand shears. The long neck shears is perfect for this task. I don't have to stoop at all and the grass is even at the fence.This is an excellent product.
1,FISKARS LONG HANDLED SHEARS,"VERY DIFFICULT TO WORK STANDING UP. THOUGHT THESE SHEARS WOULD BE EASY TO HANDLE, RATHER THAN THE HAND SHEARS THAT YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO SIT ON GROUND TO USE...GUESS I WILL HAVE TO USE GAS POWERED EDGERS TO DO THE JOB...CAN'T SIT ON GROUND ANYMORE....OR ELSE HIRE SOMEONE...GETTING OLD!!! LIFE GOES FAST, ""LIKE A JET"" !!! REMEMBER THAT !! I DID RETURN IT, CAN'T REMEMBER IF I WAS CREDITED,,THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT GOES ""YOUR MEMORY"""
1,grass shearr,good deliver and packaged good. It never did work worth adamn.Have it hanging in garden house and it should be in the garbage.
5,Just Plain Great,"These are fantastic, and allow you to trim up areas without all the collateral damage a weed eater can cause. They also make a great complement to a push type reel mower . . . I use mine to snip off the tall, reedy seed stalks in my mutt grass before mowing, ensuring an even cut.The only issue I've seen is that the little piece of plastic on the underside (i.e. at the bottom of the shaft) can come off if you're rough enough, but still it takes a beating."
2,Return the product already,"Returned the product already, it is not easy at all to use it , although web said is easy, my hand is getting hurt after 5 min usage"
1,shoddy item,"Fiskars Long Handled Swivel Grass Shears #9210Thank goodness I did not buy, after borrowing some from a friend to try on my lawn, what a disappointment, they hardly manage a few blades of grass at a time the handle is just a lazy gimmick, I had to shop in the UK (on line) for a decent pair of ordinary long handle lawn shears, without that ridiculous handle operation, And Fiskars shears seem to dominate the on line (shear) market, what a shame that the US market does not have a better product to offer in a simple garden tool."
5,Fiscars 9210 Long-handled swivel grass shears,"I am an old man,and have a hard time to bend over to cut grass. With this, I can do cut grass standing up.Thanks Amazon to have them. Looked at a number stores asked them,and told me, that they never seen them!"
4,Using Fiskars 9210,"They work well to reduce bending/stooping otherwise needed to trim a little vegetation in lots of places. The kind we remember, from many years ago, had a pair of wheels at the heel (joint between vertical shaft and shears). We would prefer that but could not find such a device."
3,The ultimate tool for the already manicured yard,"This is a great tool when trimming grass around the perimiter of one's yard, but only if the soil has been worked around the yard already. Once I worked the soil and loosened it around the trimming area it worked great!!! I have a big yard though, so by the time I get the trimming done, it's time to start over. For the cost of the product, it is worth it. I think my expectations were higher than they should have been. The pivoting head is a real plus for lefties as well. It is a work-out for my RA hands though."
2,well..... i dunno,"work great for a few minutes, but if you have alot of trimming to do, get something more automated. i was trying to go green, but sometimes, it isn't worth the carpal tunnel"
1,Bad Idea,"I was looking for something manual to replace my gas powered weed trimmer. I have a reel mower that works great, and I wanted a human powered weed trimmer to match. This, however, is not the answer I was looking for."
3,Not for Heavy Stuff,I have used this for a number of years and still do. It suffices for occasional light cutting in (hand mower) hard to reach areas of my tiny lawn. I have not been able to use it for edging the grass in any real sense of the word. Neatening up maybe but edging no. It will not cut a full swath or blade length so I have to nibble at the grass. A handy addition but not a replacement for a string trimmer or some such here in California.
4,Just what I was looking for.,"I have to agree with the fellow above, very nice lawn tool.Not to heavy, two handed operation like he said.This is for grass though, not even light jagger bushes will cut easily. I could see that you would damage it trying to cut heavier weeds and such. But grass, just fine. I don't like weedeaters, they used to kill my back. But this didn't, just much slower going.Plus the head rotates ! I didn't realize that, nice option."
5,Fiskaars 9210 Long Handled Swivel Grass Shears,"Recieved in perfect condition, but weather to cold to use yet. Had a hard time finding this product locally and was glad to find then at Amazon. I know they will be a great product, how long they will last remains to be seen, but they appear to be a very good product."
3,Cuts grass,Works as advertised. Takes a lot of wrist and hand motion but leaves grass cut without throwing it everywhere like a weed eater does. Not for heavy stuff or for a large amount of trimming.
5,Long handled grass shears,"Shears are like I expected, had some 40 years ago. These new ones are much lighter and easier to use, and the ""head swivel"" feature is must useful. Long tough strands of grass tend to cause the shears to twist sideways and NOT get cut.Other than that, I can cut the long grass along the fence line from my ATV, without getting out and walking. I highly recommend these grass shears.L. Looger Red Rock, Texas"
4,no more sore knees,"No more sore knees. Another great tool from Fiskars. The long-handled grass shears are light weight, the blades lock when not in use,the shears can be swiveled for vertical trimming/edging. There is an ample hand grip that I found comfortable for either my right or left hand. I purchased them to trim around raised garden boxes and did them all in the time it took me to trim around one with hand held shears. Saves on gas, noise from power trimmers, especially for small areas or around delicate vegetation. Have only had them a short time so can't advise about longevity except that I have had other Fiskars tools for many years that are still working and expect that to be the case with this tool as well. So far, I am very pleased with this product and with the service I received from Amazon.com.Fiskars 9210 Long-Handled Swivel Grass Shears"
3,Father's Day gift,I bought this for my 60 year old father who loves to garden. I thought that he could use the shears for 'light' yard work and not have to bend down and hurt his back.It arrived in a oversized box with about 50 feet of paper packaging to protect it.I gave it to my Dad who read the light instructions attached and tried to demo it.He had a hard time it to 'swivel'. It appeared that it does not swivel like you'd think. You have to manually adjust it to get it to swivel; not that it swivels on its own.
3,Such a good idea is just not solid enough,"I like the idea behind the tool. It's light enough to work for an hour or better without too much strain. The adjustable angle works well and has enough settings to be practical for a number of uses. However, I found that the metal on the blades is too soft and nicks too easily, which, due to the cutting angle, causes the shears to hang up and fail to cut."
3,Not for large clumps of grass,"Great idea for those of us who have difficulty bending to trim areas around plants. The tool is helpful, light in weight, but does not handle large clumps of grass. A few blades here and there is what this product handles. If you do try to cut clumps the blades can get stuck."
3,Not for mass trimming,"I purchased the long-handled grass shear as a replacement to an Black and Decker electric (rechargable) hand-held grass shear. I hated having to bend over with the old unit and when it finally gave out I decided to purchase something that would put a little less strain on my back. I can't use a string trimmer because I have delicate flowers and plants near the edge of the grass.I have found that the long-handled grass shear does prevent a great deal of strain on the back. It works very well in trimming around trees and hard edges. However, the blades are difficult to position when edging a border (nothing to place one of the blades against as a guide.) It takes approximately 3 times as long to trim these egdes and I still miss some spots."
1,garbage,"I had great hopes for this. I've long searched for ways to cut weeds without having to bend over. This tool is lightweight, enough so for one-handed use. Perhaps durability was sacrificed for weight, but after being used for only a short time, the spring in the mechanism up top dislodged somehow and the blades would no longer open correctly. No amount of trying to grab the end of that spring with longnosed pliers would work to pop it back where it was supposed to go. The tool is riveted, not bolted together, thereby preventing me from taking it apart to try to fix it. I had to toss it in the trash as it was useless, taking up room, and irreparable. I've had other stuff from Fiskars that I was happy with, for example a bypass pruner with long handles and a gear mechanism for leverage."
2,Unnecessary,"This movie tries to follow in the footsteps of Shrek by taking an irreverent take on fairy tales and making references to many of the classics. However, where Shrek was hilarious, Happily N'Ever After doesn't. The story is irreverent but the plot and characters are pretty childish. The Snow White disco scene at the beginning was a bit too far. The princess act like a bunch of Paris Hilton wannabes. Moreover, the animation is pretty lousy compared to the standards of Shrek and Pixar. It looks like animation for a Saturday morning kid's show. Overall, not recommended."
2,Spoiled Rotten HipHop Princess,"The princess in this movie is spoiled rotten from the start making it hard to like her at all, her friends are as equally as spoiled, if not more. Adding little touches like a club scene, cell phones, and the incredibly stupid phrase 'holla' just make this movie incredibly tedious. While it tries to teach good values in the end it takes too long and the main character doesn't show enough change. I could definitely do without hiphop music and references in my fairytales and I don't think it's a very good example for young children."
1,No innocence,I turned this off after about 10 minutes. Characters were sassy and FAR from being sweet princesses. Guess it's geared for tweens...
3,First one was better.,My five year old lost interest quickly. I watched it until the end. The story was less about the sorcerer apprentices and less funny.
4,Far better than I expected,"I was torn as to whether or not I should even watch this. I'm glad I did. My kids really enjoyed it! The computer animation could use a little work, but it's not bad at all. The story line is cute and includes a very good moral lesson. Definately worth the time if you have children."
1,I ordered this by accident,"I ordered this by accident when I was wanting to just watch it. I'm an Amazon prime member, and should have been able to watch it for free- why would I order a digital copy if I can watch it for free? It's not that great of a movie, (i mean- it's ok. If you have prime your kids will like it) and I'd be happy to trade it for one that I can't watch for free on Prime."
2,"daughter loves it, but quality is terrible","The animation on these movies is horrid, and the storyline somewhat hard to follow, but my five year old loves to watch it, so we indulge her once in awhile. She has a wonderful imagination that must fill in all the gaps."
1,Waste of time,"Thought this would be a good family movie... until the kids started asking to do something, anything else and the princess characters in their skimpy outfits started prancing around. My daughters don't need to see that as acceptable. Seemed like some VERY lonely man needed to live out his fantasy through sleazily dressed cartoon characters. The script was absolutely snore worthy. Lack of creativity and wit, this movie is a great way to waste precious time you'll never get back."
2,Did not care for this book,"My 4-year old did not really enjoy this movie, and frankly, I thought it was a little too mature and angry for this audience. Would not recommend it."
3,Kinda silly,"Although my 5 yr old loved it, I just thought it was okay. Not terribly witty or funny, but it has enough princess-y and girly stuff going on to keep a 5 yr old girl interested... Not sure if that's good or bad."
1,wow this sucks,"holy crap, i thought the original was bad, but at least it was fully rendered and didn't make me want to punch the TV.never never nevernevernevernevernever pay money for this garbage."
2,Ick,Not on par with the first movie at all. Poorly animated in comparison and a storyline so simple and dumbed down for today's audience it hurts to listen.
5,nice twist on a classic movie,"First 15 minutes were confusing, and than the movie started to get good direction, and ended on a good note"
3,XCAPE is not to bad!,"""Arms of the one"" is my favorite song from XCAPE. My least favorite is ""Little Secret"" because the lyrics influences cheating/one night stands/affairs."
2,Xscape: still a second rate female group,"WOW,what money can buy! Money has bought Xscape a new look and a great song writer (Diane Warren,) but money will never buy them better voices and a style of their own. Their new album is a tad boring. If you are going to make an album full of ballads, don't have all the words essentially saying the same thing (""you cheated on me,"" or ""I cheated on you."") Boring!!! Xscape will always be second to female groups like SWV, TLC and En Vogue. Sorry girls, nice try but no cigar."
2,honest,"I only remember a few tracks, one and five and six. some people loved track six but I hated it."
1,they been kissing all on each other,sorry never liked xcsape anyway all of their cd's sucked from day one and this is 1 girl group I'm glad bit the dust.
3,Not as good as I thought it was,"I wanted this CD so bad, but that i got i realized that it is not as good as i thought it was my favorites songs on it is:1.My Little Secret2. Softest Place on Earth3. The Arms of the One who loves you4. All I need5.Hold On6.All About MeAnd thats itthe rest of the album just isnt songs you can listen to over and over again, back to back."
3,Could have used a few more slow cuts,"I'm not a real big Xscape fan, but I generally buy all their albums...who knows why. Traces of My Lipstick is yet another album done by Jermain Dupri and like most of his stuff it's tight work. I think it could have used just a few more slow songs though."
5,Perfect Xscape...............................,"This album was the highlight of their career.The songs are key and their harmonies are on point.Songs ""My Little Secret"", ""All I Need"" , ""Hold On"" and ""Am I Dreaming"" are all pure real good R&&B; music. ""Top picks ""Softest Place On Earth"" and ""The Arms Of The One Who Loves You"" are both the top picks of the album where they shine the most.If more groups areound these days could have harmonies are great songs like Xscape they would have more longevity.Even after this album the group broke up and is getting back together.Im sure they will be better than ever after their return.OVERALL GRADE = 95/100 A+"
4,"Too short, but still pretty good.","A quick glance at the huge back catalog of fab bluegrass owned by the Universal corporation (which includes MCA-Decca, among other labels). As with many MCA-Universal reissues, this disc is a bit too short (only 12 tracks), but it's still full of good music, and could serve as an adequate introduction to the genre. The musicians range from old-schoolers Bill Monroe, Flatt & Scruggs and the Stanley Brothers to young 'uns like Ricky Skaggs and Vince Gill. Also nice to see the Osbourne Brothers and the Stoneman family getting their propers. Good for anyone curious about this music, but a longer, more in-depth collection woudl also be nice.."
5,Great tool for pruning your low trees!,"This product is perfect if you need to trim trees that are up to 6' taller than you are. I was impressed by how well this tool cut through my palm trees, and it was pretty easy for me as a female to exert enough pressure to do so. Saved me $200 on a tree trimming service and I'm delighted with my purchase."
3,likeable tool,great cutting tool.. cuts thru limbs like butter. however it only lasts one or two seasons. wish could be made to last.
5,Exceptionally Happy with Purchase,"Based on other reviewers I decided to take a gamble with this pruner and could not be happier. I can now easily use it to prune up to 1"" branches overhanging from a neighbor's yard and also as a stick to cut thick weeds at ground level without bending over hardly at all. While there are some external plastic parts the head and chain pull are all good metal. You can easily make a 5' extension cut by pulling on the end lanyard (nice feature.)I made several hundred cuttings in the last two days with no difficulties. I suspect a little oil once in a while would not hurt.You can tilt the head for ground clippings but this is one defect in the design - however it is still useful.Consider this a very useful purchase."
5,Better Mousetrap,"I agree with all the positive reviews.Light weight, rotating head, self contained pull cord all make for a better mousetrap.Note that this is the short unit & only good for trees 8-10 ft. tall."
5,Love this tool,"I bought this today at Home Depot (same price as amazon). It has been in my wish list for some time. I used it for about an hour after purchasing. And, I love it. The design is very elegant and simple to use. It is such a far cry from the tree trimming tools that 'saw' through the branch. This is just like using your clippers or loppers.It cuts like butter.Kudos to Fiskars for creating such a nice product. I hope it holds up (I don't see why it won't). I would have bought the telescoping version but figured for the few times that I needed to, I would just pull out a ladder."
4,Really good product,"My only disappointment is with the strap pull. If it were a loop instead of a strap with a knot in it, it would function well. I bought this tool because a friend owns one; I felt like a heel borrowing it so often.Except for the strap (which is only needed sometimes)this is a great tool."
3,More Chinese landfill fodder,"Just more Chinese crap. Pruning ""Stik"" jammed after light use, and I'll darned if I'm going to spend my time disassembling and repairing."
2,plastic mounting,"if you look closely to the cutter mounting, it made out of PLASTIC.plastic can not against the tree. My stik is broken, even it is best prunner but now useless. Lucky, Fiskars sent a replacement and ofcourse plastic head again."
2,"Fiskars 62"" Pruner","This product is excellant in all respects. It is well made, sharp, and cuts easily through branches up to 1.5 inches. But it is limited to branches within its 5 foot reach. It is therefore desirable to also have Fiskars telescoping pruner, which is the best that I have ever used."
2,Pruner,I would give this product 2 of 5 Stars. The item isnt that long you still need to get on a ladder.The pole does not extend the pole is pretty cheap made. Its sharp and goes thur my mesquite tree pretty easy. When i Got my item thur the mail the pruner was out of its package kind of looked like as it was used??Im NEVER BUYING FROM AMAZON EVER !!!!Seems like all there produsts are poorly made & shipped way to slow !!!!
5,excellent,"I was doubtful when seeing its usage on-line but after I received it I discovered that it could be used for cutting other things that require bending over, which I can't do due to athritius. As a pruner for my trees, such as crepe myrtle and peach trees it is a valuable tool that has no equal."
4,Great for elder gardeners,I bought this item for my Dad who is in his 60's now and still loves to garden.It's helped him reach the high branches without having to get on a ladder and deal with balance.I also got him the small hand held pruners. Fiskars really delivers on their products
5,Fantastic Product,Lightweight yet feels well made. I use for both basic trimming and light to med. pruning. Works like a champ.
2,Bad mistake,I used it twice and the top of the cutting section fell off and the line pulled of the handle.
5,Pruning shears,"We looked hard to find just what my husband wanted. These are perfect. He immediately headed for the shrubs, and is very happy with them."
4,Pretty good,The blade and pull mechanism is so much better than the rope pull style. The only problem is you are not able to use the full reach because the pull mechanism is half way up the stick so you really only can extend 31 inches and not 62. Price on Amazon is $10 higher than Home Depot.
4,"Nice magnetic dry erase calendar, but...","This is nice for what it is. It still is probably the best option for the price out there. I did have to return one because the packaging caused little indentations all throughout the calendar. The resent it in the same crap packaging, but it had less indentations. I decided to just accept the two vs the 6 on the previous. More have been created over time and it really has just sat on my wall. I write on it a few times a month, but definitely could be really annoying if you are bothered by those kinds of things. I deal with it, but if I were a little more anal I'd be pissed. Still overall a nice calendar and I don't mean to sound so negative. It does help."
5,Bravo!,"I have been teaching Chicana and Latina Literature for nearly twenty years. No one dunks that ball each and each time with my students as this prolific, immensely intelligent, politically committed and talented writer. Whether it is a tale about the Southwest, expounding on the specificity of being a brown woman in the U.S. or teaching us how to love ourselves as a people, she does it all with the ease of the master craftsperson that she has become. My favorite poems in this collection were: 1. Without question the most poignant love poem I've read in a long time, ""I Ask the Impossible, 2. A poem for her son, which shows her trademark sense of humor, ""El Chicle,""; and the eerily prophetic, ""While I Was Gone a War Began,"" (in this one she foresaw the plane hijackings by Bin Laden 4 years before they happened!) among several others. I look forward to sharing her next collection with my future students."
5,Pure Love,"Dusk is just pure love for me. it's a must buy!! I am in country music city (Nashville)USA, music like this does not get played.Get out there and hear the music."
5,Give it a listen!,"Another classic from Matt Johnson. ""Dusk"" sits well between the musical style of ""Mindbomb"" and the darker/heavier ""NakedSelf"". The line from the track Slow Emotion Replay gives a good indication of album's musings....""Everybody Knows what's going wrong with the world,I don't even know what's going on in myself""The musicianship, as you come to expect from Mr Johnson and his cohorts is top notch from the funky ""Sodium Light Baby"" to the slow heavy ""Lung Shadows"". Around the time this album was released, Johnson despaired about the social condition of the UK - he upped sticks for Sweden and the USA. That disgruntlement is to the fore on this album. If you like thought provoking music laden with introspection then Dusk is well worth your time checking out."
5,my most important cd,i have been coming back to this cd over and over for over 10 years. im only 26 and i know this cd more than any other cd. its not even the type of music i would suggest is MY type of music.none the less...i come back again and again.so much knowledge and wisdom on this disc...so much.:)
1,Pityful Duty Rechargeable Night Light is it's real NAME!!!!!,"Look here! If you are trying to buy a night light in your house DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Even if it looks good and the price is lower than the retail price. Listen to me! I used to work at Home Depot in the Light and tool selection and this is not a good night light. It takes forever to charge and guess what.... Us people don't live forever! So i tryed the ugly looking contraption and when i woke up there was no light and it had been broken. [$$$] is not what you should pay for this. I prefer the intermatic GN12c Automatic flash light at a very reasonable price. If you had read this review thank you sincerely and I hope I helped you with this item. I have bought many things from AMAZON.com and they are the greatest website in the world because of there low prices, there variaty of everything and there king support when I need help. Thank you AMAZON and I am spreading the word about you everyday! Thank You!"
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,This doesn't give as much light as I would have liked. It's almost less light than a regular nightlight. It's easy to use. All you have to do is push it down to turn it on.
4,Pretty good,i like the product and it arrived on time. but i wanted to order more than one and it wouldn't tell me why i couldn't. everything else was perfect.
2,BEWARE - This light is NOT rated past 1 meter depth !,This light (Pelican 2140 Tracker) is NOT rated to the 500 feet stated on Amazon.According to Pelican it is ONLY rated to 1 METER for 30 minutes. Check for yourself at [...]
5,Life Changing,"I'm a reader but had never read any of Ian Thomas, though have heard him quoted through the years. A classic that is easy to read, full of easy-to-understand truths and illustrations. I'm rereading it now."
5,When U Love an Album,"When you love somebody and bite your tongue...This is such a great album. Wholeheartedly recommend. I can listen to ""When U love Somebody"" 4x a day still, many years after purchasing this cd."
3,Acceptable,"These speakers can handle a lot of power, but I think they lack power in the low frequencies, I wasn't expecting something equal to a subwoofer, but when I stand in front of them, the bass is just not there. In general, the sound is loud and clear, but not equally distributed on all frequencies, so if you want and expect a thumping bass, this one is not for you."
5,I dare you to read this book and not become paranoid!,"I don't remember why I started reading this book, but I have spent the past year ingesting it in dainty, sanity-promoting bites. Funny? Certainly, in a bent and cynical way. But mostly it's informative, maybe even a little depressing (hence the nibbling), which is a direct result of their fairly consistent objectivity. What I've liked most about this book is the insight the authors give on the players and their motivations. Yes, I know more about the conspiracies themselves, but more important, they've shown me what kinds of questions to be asking and how to pay attention to details. I'll never be the same again! (grin)"
4,great fun,"this is perfect for the xfiles/alien geeks just like me, if you are one of those, get this book!"
2,not so great.,"This was great when I first had it installed. Then I redid my counter and put in a new sink so it was re-installed. It wont work right since. The spray does not work right and the hot and cold wont stay where they should be when you turn the handle. We adjusted it but it just wont stay. Yes , it was installed by a licensed professional both times."
4,Rieu's First American Concerts,"This performance is also known as ""The North America I Love"", but doesn't match the audio CD. It's a fun view for hard-core Andre Rieu fans because it was Andre's first venture into North America, and his violin performance is crisp, fresh and energetic. His style is still developing and the orchestra is somewhat smaller, but there are great moments. At one point he harrasses some late-comers to the concert, as well as telling some interesting stories about the music he plays. Includes some delightful numbers he doesn't play often, like ""Im Krapfenwaldl (Cuckoo Song)"", ""The Third Man Theme"" and ""Circus Renz""."
5,Essential...,"This book was such a helpful reference for the culture and history of Biejing! Not only did it lead us to some of the most incredible historical sights and restaurants, but it also prepped us for the culture shock that we experienced. I will purchase Frommers guides for every place I travel from this experience forward...don't leave the hotel without it!!"
1,Why did the authors bother to go?,"I have depended on Frommer's guides for more than 2 decades so this was the guide I initially picked before going to Beijing. Most of the hotel and restaurant info were accurate if not obvious (lacking the usual Frommer gems). The major sights were also described in adequate detail. However, the authors' unrelenting snide remarks of the Chinese people, culture, government and seemingly everything else to do with the place, make me wonder if they should be relied on to guide me to Beijing. At the end, these personal remarks told me a lot more about Mr. Neville-Hadley than I really cared to know."
3,Adequately Good,A nice collection - though the material is quite outdated. A glaring omission from this clever compendium is Father's Day - Mother's Day is well-treated with illustrations - but no mention of dads whatsoever. Too bad a more modern edition has not been printed.
3,5 Star until my Hot Tub Leaked!,"I thought this lil vac was incredible! When I first received it I was shocked how small it was. But it is perfect for my mitre saw, cleaning out the Jeep, quick pick ups. I would have given it a 5 until last night when my hot tub sprang a leak....... It wouldnt even hold a quart of water when the ""misting"" occured. Manual says that when picking up several tanks of liquid a, misting may appear thru the exhaust. This occured on the first tank. You must remove the foam cover and wring it out. It still did it the first time afterwards. Also it simply doesnt hold anymore than about a quart of water fefore the ball valve engages. So for vacuuming I would give it a 5 but for wet applications I wouldnt give it a 0!!!!!! I would buy this again for the dryer vents, saw dust etc...... but for a dual purpose.....get a much bigger one!!!! One other thing, the vacuum bags are nearly impossible to find locally. Get them online if you do decide to purchase."
3,"Man, that thing is tiny...","I knew it would be small when I saw 1.5 gallon, but it was disappointing how small it is. I was hoping it would be more like the big ones, just shrunk proportionally. It's not that quiet as everyone says, but it is very portable, which is why I'll keep it. Don't buy this if you want something industrial, that it certainly is not. If you want something that will take care of small-mid sized jobs, it's your vacuum. It has average amounts of power but if I had to do it over again, I would not have purchased this one."
4,Nice little vacuum,"Perfect when you want to clean up a smaller mess without have to deal with a huge vacuum. If you dealing with bigger messes, you'll need to go with a bigger unit."
5,1 1/2 gal Shop Vac,"Great Computer electronics vac when purchased with Shop-Vac #80189-62-4 Micro Cleaning KitReally does the job and is useful for many different areas, nice length to the hose. So far I am extremely pleased.Looks abet old fashioned.Wish the cord were retractable, but wrapping around the unit must have kept the price lower."
4,Just a great little vacuum cleaner,"I bought this for my wife to clean the parakeet's cage. (She has nine parakeets in a large cage.) It's fairly quiet, works very well, comes with a host of hose accessories, and it has casters, which is very rare for a unit of its small size.The only thing my wife doesn't like is the power switch, which is a silicone boot covered rocker switch that just isn't so obvious to use, despite the ON and OFF markings."
5,Strong and Lightweight,Easy to use. Really picks up the dirt. Haven't used it for water yet. Attachments work great.
4,Shop-Vac 971-02-00 1-1/2-Gallon 2 HP Wet/Dry Vacuum,"Good suction, wheels make it easy to move, plenty of cord and hose so that you don't have to keep unplugging it. Only negative - doesn't have a place to attach hose for blower function, like the larger models."
4,"Screwing drywall, Made Easy","I bought this tool over a year ago. I work for a residetial remodeling company. We don't hang drywall on a daily basis. But we do it on most of the jobs we have. I have a corded screw gun, but most of the time it gets in the way. So I tried to find a cordless screw gun locally but I was unable to do so. I found Tool Crib while earching the web. I called them up and got the drill. I was pleasently surprised at how well the tool worked. I used it on a few jobs at work and was very pleased. I would recomed this tool to any one who does drywall, or any job that requires a corded driver drill."
3,good tool,"I am a full time drywall installer and have owned one of these screw guns for about 4 years. I use it in place of a corded gun so it gets used almost constantly. I have had it repaired several times (trigger&transmission) but it was relatively inexpensive when the amount of use I have gotten out of it is figured in. The only complaints I have is the slower speed and the need for a more adequate cooling system, otherwise I love this thing."
5,The debut of a great talent,"I picked this up at a show in New York a couple of years ago and have made a couple dozen copies for friends. It's only 5 songs, but each one rocks. This band has a lot of energy and the songs are great. Highly recommend."
1,Time Travelers,"This is a really disappointing CD. Their first offering, Stone Age, was one of the best CDs i've ever heard- a fantastic blend of folk traditions with funky new grooves. But this (Time Travelers) sounds like all the out-takes from the first CD. It is an incipid replica of the things that made Stone Age brilliant- sounds like they simply stuck to a formula which worked really well with the first CD- but all their best material was used up in that effort; and this second one is just a pale imitation. The best i can say of it- its a frizbee!"
5,2005 Trailer Life Directory,This is like a bible of RV places. I love all the information that in it.
3,Not a rave,Only wanted the one song on the disc and this seemed to be an okay album. The gravelly voice wears on one after a while.
3,Stuttering,"I like their different music. a break from all the screaming stuff i usaully listen to. ""Stuttering"" is the best!"
4,"Carry On, Rise, Harmonica in F","Listen to ""Kiss me again"" its from the U.S. and Canadian released Dentine ice commercial. The vocals and lyrics are soft and easy to listen to. The whole CD has a really laid back and simple, yet attention holding sound. The band has good harmony and rhythm. Genra considered pop, alternative, and acoustic."
1,UTTER CRAP AND NOT BLU-RAY ITS JUST A DVD-R AVCHD,"FULL ON SCAM, OF SOME PERSON SMOKING WEED AND PLAYING HIS WEAK SOUNDING KEYBOARD. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO A PRESCHOOL MUSICAL FOR BETTER SOUND REALITY. THIS WILL GET PULLED FROM SALE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BLU-RAY DISK IT IS JUST A DVD-R IN AVCHD FORMAT THAT ANY ONE CAN MAKE AT HOME WITH A BLUE BOX AND COPIED PAPER COVER...I'VE JUST HIT A QUADRUPLE WHAMMY OUCH...."
2,Music to wear out your player with,"I have several multi-channel SACDs/DVD-As. Pink Floyd 'DSOTM', Kitaro 'Sacred Journey of Ku-Kai', Jean-Michel Jarre 'Oxygene', etc... I knew that this was a music only Bluray disc and was excited to hear 7.1 surround.The music is techno but not good techno. My DENON AVR-4308CI/DENON DVD-2500BTCI sounds better with stereo CDs then this disc.The most troubling thing was that the slide show of pictures caused my player to spin the disc at a very high speed. Like a CD-Rom being read in my computer. Worried that it would wear out my brand new bluray machine and not being the least bit interested in the music or the slideshow of boring computer generated art - I hit eject and will never play this title again.2 stars is being generous..."
1,Does not play,"I've ordered two copies with great excitement over the style of recording only to be disappointed that the DVD will not play. It's stated to be a blu-ray, but is not. I have a Panasonic DMP-BD80 ($400.00 Blu-ray player) and it will not play. I'm very disappointed with this experience. Also the quality looks like someone is burning and labelling this product from a home office and tossing it in a Blu-ray case.Over all experience with this process has been 1 out of 10."
1,Different but not in a good way,"The only thing that might keep you going is the story, the game play is atrocious. It is essentially a rail shooter. There are puzzle elements but they mostly consist of go get something from somewhere else and bring it here. It also will tell you exactly how to solve the puzzles if you don't want to think. The shooting gets old after a while. Especially after killing two ghosts, waiting 30 seconds for the next area to load, getting an item and bringing it back, waiting 30 seconds to load previous area again, and then killing the same two ghosts."
1,Worthless for my project,Bought this to hook my mini vac to my router table. Does not fit the hose without removing the end; does not fit the vac port of the router table at all.
3,Not Perfect,"Adapter is good but would be better if it were a tighter fit. Had to add tape to one end of fitting in order for fitting to stay in place. Have experience with same adapter purchased earlier and no tape was needed, so apparently quality control has slipped a bit."
3,vac,"Whats to say it came on time it fits, its a pc of plastic to convert hose sizes to fit my shop vac"
2,Didn't fit for me. See review for ID and OD,"PLEASE post actual dimensions for these vacuum adapters if you buy one!!!Big end OD is 2.48"" and ID is 2.28""Small end OD is 1.20"" and ID is 1.03""It didn't fit into either side of the connection I was trying to make - attaching my Fein vacuum to a Bosch router table.The adapter is made of hard plastic (like other vacuum accessories) - there is no stretch or give to it."
3,Didn't need it,"I'm sure this adapter is great, but figured out i didn't need it. I bought it because those who also bought the shop vac I bought also bought it. Turns out the shop vac I got already came with the adapter."
5,Shop Vac Adaptor/Reducer,"LOL. Not much to review about this. It's an adaptor for the Shop-Vac type of vacuum cleaner from the 2 1/2 inch hose down to a 1 1/4 inch hose (which is the size of a standard household vacuum hose). It allows you to use your regular vacuum attachments with the Shop-Vac. I ordered it, it arrived in a few days, and it fits both sizes just fine. That's about it."
4,Same high quality Shop-Vac hose as original,"This hose is a duplicate of the 2.5 hose that comes with all the Shop-Vac fullsize vacuums. My original has been durable over several years of use. Shop-Vac has a patented hose locking system that makes it head & shoulders better than some other brands where the hose is always pulling away from the vacuum. It also keeps the hose from kinking up by being free moving. I've used Shop-Vac part # 906-86-00 2.5"" Hose Coupling (For Coupling 2.5"" hoses) to double the length of hose for my Shop-Vac 931-16-11. You should have no trouble with the extra hose length usage with a 4 hp vac or higher.This is a medium weight vac hose for a decent price. There are a few heavier duty hose products (Mr Hose) out there, but for general use the Shop-Vac product works great!"
3,The hose lasts forever but hose ends aren't replaceable.,I got my original hose with the 10 Gal stainless QSP Shopvac over 10 years ago and within a few years the plastic ends of the hose started breaking down and despite my best efforts to glue them back together they just disintegrated. The hose is still fine but is rendered useless without the rotating cuffs on the ends. I just wish the cuffs could be ordered separately. I just bought the 8 foot hose that does have removable ends but no part numbers for those parts either. I'm hoping that the plastic in the newer ends holds up better. I'm using my shopvac in a machine shop environment and I'm pretty sure the cutting oil I'm using is affecting the plastic.
1,replacement hose not extension hose,I bought this hose to extend the reach of my new shop vac. If I had read a little more closely I would have seen that this is a replacement hose. It will not attach to the existing hose to extend the overall length.
2,good historical piece,"While much of the music on here may not be that memorable, it is still an interesting reference CD to the double bass-less works of Bottesini. Most of these works are pulled from his operas and while some are actually rather nice, the orchestra isn't always accurate. The versions on Thomas Martin's Bottesini Vol 3 CD are much better."
1,WARNING!,"The only reason I can imagine why this box got so many positive reviews may be the latest review-date being 2005. Reviewed from a 2010 point of view the quality of this boxset is just HIDEOUS!- No digitally remastered DVDs but mostly lousy VHS-Rips- 7 of the 10 movies are presented in the wrong aspex ratio (4:3 Fullscreen instead of 2,35:1 Scope, not anamorphic)- Poor picture and sound quality- Just dubbed dialogue, no original japanese language track- Presentation/Design of the box is ultra-cheap- No Extras at allDO NOT BUY IT! All of these movies are available in decent prints on solo-discs."
5,Jaw-Dropping,"The story behind these photos makes them all the more awe-inspiring, but their beauty stands alone. Superb photography and design, unique and amazing subject. If you're looking for something new from a photography book, this is it."
5,Sublime. Moved me to Tears,"It is hard to explain the haunting beauty of these photographs without viewing them for oneself. I can only say that they powerfully capture the monk's holy pursuit of God and the sense of nearness to the heavenly kingdom with which they live. Even apart from any interest in Mount Athos and Orthodox monasticism I think this collection of photos would be of the utmost value to anyone interested in history and the depth of the human condition. For the Orthodox faithful these photos provide a certain kind of ""iconography"" - a theology in pictures that leads to meditation on the mystical transfiguration of the human person."
4,Great little Cam.,"I had my concers at first about this cam. I've read in several places that the stil pic quality wasn't good, and that the quality of the film was poor in low light. Well I'm glad to say that I have not had those problems at all. There are all sorts of tweaks that you can do with the cam that will make it look great in most places. I've had the cam for about a week now and both the Wife and I find it very easy to use!"
4,Has a repair notice on it.,"I bought this camera about 21 months ago; I have only used it a couple of times but without a problem. When I tried to used it the other day I was able to record sound but no picture. I was prepared to buy a new camera, until I found that Canon has a repair notice on it for this problem. They will fix it free of charge even if out of warranty; I could not ask for more!"
4,"Easy to use, nice images, but I've had a couple of problems","The camera is very easy to use, and is small and handy. It has more functions than you'd really want in such a camera -- if you are ever going to do something with the footage you will be using a computer and an editing program, so you don't really need the editing modes on the camera. Still, there's no complaint here, and it's flexible enough for most users.My only complaint is that for some reason on my camera when I flipped the lcd viewer around to see from the front the image didn't rotate. I know it's supposed to do this, and it did it with the model at the store. Or: when I closed the lcd viewer with it flipped around the image shut off and I couldn't see it anymore. I'm assuming this had to do with a bad wire. But, I had no problem returning it to get a new one, so this wasn't a huge problem, only inconvenient.All in all I would say that this is a solid entry-level camcorder, that is fairly priced and easy to use."
1,DONT BUY,"I bought this recorder, and used it here and there for special occations, now the camera stopped working. Just a white screen to look at. I hear the camera just stop working, it shows on the lcd for about 10 secs then white. Worthless piece of equipment. Should of bought the exteneded warrenty, would of made my money back on that one. This baby is going to the bottom of the trach can. GO SONY"
2,"very poor camcorder, try to avoid this one","I got this as christmas gift, and used it mostly indoors, sometime at night, for the past month. The still pictures came out very bad. That doesn't bother me much since I have digital cameras. However, this camera is very poor indoors, even with the night mode, the video came with very high background, color granules everywhere. it is much worse than the old miniDV I have, a Sharp model I got in 2001, which is very bulky but has been very reliable. I made two DVD side by side, and the one with Canon looks horrible. Outdoor shots are fair, but many occasions I have to take shots indoor or at night. I would go with other models if possible."
