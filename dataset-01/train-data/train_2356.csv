3,plastic hooks!,"Well, one of the main reasons I bought this item was because of the seemingly shiny metal hooks on the back, but when I received them, guess what the hooks are really made of... yes, plastic. So if you're not planning to carry big, heavy stuff, this bag would actually be a very good buy"
3,"007 - Good, but needs improvement","The measuring stick for all 3d shooters for XBOX is thus far Halo. Although 007 was a pretty good game, a little easy for my taste, it is still lacking some of the great features that Halo does provide. 007 does have the bots format, which Halo does not, so if you don't have many friends to play against, you can still do the multiplayer. Overall, if you already have Halo, get this. If not, get Halo."
3,Could Have bin better,"At first, I never herd of James Bond. So Agent Under Fire was my first time seing Bond.1. Graphics: Good but could have bin better. No faces on the Bad Guys BOOOOO2. GamePlay: The only thing I like about story mode, is that, well...your bond.3. Sound: Great just Great. If you have 5.1 in your house, then the sound on this game will rock your world!!!In short, It is not the best but still cinda good."
3,Good Game But Nightfire Is A Mile Better!,"007 Nightfire Rulez. Agent Under Fire Is Very Good But Absolute Rubbish Compared To Nightfire. I Personally Think Nightfire Is One Of The Best Games On Any Console. Although Agent Under Fire Is A Great Game And Will Keep You Occupied Nightfire Blows It To Smivarines.Agent Under Fire: 83%Nightfire: 94%Bye For Now And Trust Mew Bye Them Both But Nightfire Will Reign Ure Favourite! It's Better Than Goldeneye, Tommorow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, 007 Racing And Agent Under Fire Put Together!Thanx And See Ya Around!"
1,Not Worth The Money,"This game is very disapointing. First of all the graphics are not that good. I expected a realistic looking game, but this is not that. Secondly there are not enough levels. You can beat the game in hours. Thirdly, the reason I bought the game is mostly for multiplayer. The player options are very limited. Perfect Dark on Nintendo 64 is a much better game. It lets you have simulants on your team and you can control if they protect you or go attack other players. The weapons on this game are limited and the levels are small. Nothing is up to standards. It seems like this game was put out in a rush with no real effort put into it. Overall, I would recomend renting the game but definitly not buying."
2,umm.............no,"Thank the lord Electronic Boutique allows you to exchange games after you buy them, I got this game cause I have been Riding high off of the Halo Multiplayer and wanted to add a little more to my head to head combat evenings. All I can really say is uch, this game was so not what I expected so I turned around and exchanged it for Rallisport Challenge, which I should say ROCKS."
3,"Its okay,but there are MUCH BETTER FPS games out!","007 AUF is okay but there are much better shooter`s out on XBox-Even better shooters on GameCube and PlayStation 2.It gets boring too fast.The multi-player is good but also gets boring.There are only four desent 007 games out and theye are:007 GoldenEye,007 TWINE,007 Everything Or Nothing and 007 From Russia With Love.There are much better shooters/tactical shooters out on XBox they are:HALOHALO 2GHOST RECONRAINBOW SIXMEDAL OF HONORCALL OF DUTYBROTHER IN ARMSOPERATION:FLASHPOINTWOLFENSTEINMEN OF VALOR:THE VIETNAM WARBATTLEFIELDand of coarse the excellent FAR CRY!They are all Great Shooters-So forget about 007 AUF,NF,TND whatever and get one of those games-i have got atleast one of each of those series-and they fry anything PS2 has!especially FAR CRY,which is MUCH better than HALO anyday!Bye"
1,What did they do?????,"OK, to start I'll tell you the good and the bad.GOOD-It has cool cars. Driving missions, with a shooter?, thats cool. Another thing that is good is the graphics.Nice citys,and environments.BAD-To start the AI is the STUPIDEST I HAVE EVER SEEN. They run around like they dont know were they are going.Thats the biggest problem. Next the levels, AND the game are way too short. There is no blood. You cant run over people in the driving mission. You shoot the guys in the head and they dont die? STUPID!!!!I WOULD NOT ADVISE BUYING THIS GAME."
2,double o- - - try again,"While the visuals are all they should be, the game itself is already played out. Like a band who releases a new cd thats is afraid to grow, ""Bond"" does not expand on the power that x-box creates. Bond leaves the gamer disappointed with the expectations of greatness that Bond initialy brought to the consumer gamer. One might as well plug in the old 64 and play Golden eye if they are craving some Bond."
4,Good Game,"Good game, but there are some really bad things about it. First the emiemys are better,but they still act pretty dumb. Another thing is that some levels have really good graphics, while others i fell are missing alot. I would recomend this game, but i would not recomend it to people who are in for a real challange."
4,very good game!!,This game is really fun. The graghics are really good but could be better.The gameplay is really good exept for the first level which is kind of boring. The storyline is kind of strang but good compared to some of the older Bond games.I own The World is Not Enough game and the perspective is clearer in this game.If you like games that are not to challenging but not to easy you should buy this game.
4,"Awesome Multiplayer, Not Bad Game","This is a good game, i really liked it, But this game doesnt even come close to goldeneye. Goldeneye was the best FPS i ever played, and this game was only ok. I enjoyed the story mode, it had a good plot, even if it wasnt based on any of the movies. But the most fun is in the multiplayer section, if you can get 2 or 3 more friends to play with you this game is great. The multiplayer is so much fun, where you can make the speed up to 250 and watch guys speed around the level, or you can change the gravity and watch guys float and do matrix-like stuff all around. Thats the most fun i had with the game, so i would recommend this game for anyone who owns an xbox and has never played any of the other bond games, but for those of you who still have an n64, dust it off and go up to your local gamestop or funcoland and see if you can find a used goldeneye, its awesome."
2,Why this?,"Get Halo. Halo is much better... 007 is only a lazy attempt to get onto the Xbox, but the aiming is totally off... the characters move way too fast... it doesn't seem human. very unrealistic."
3,"No Goldeneye, but good.","To be plain, this is a good game. The game plays much like Goldeneye, yet it is not as perplexed. Despite a few sexual connotations and occasional vulgar language, this game is a good game. The multiplayer is good, but the stages are too small, which was not a characteristic of Goldeneye. This games is *not* easy, unless you have a walkthrough article or guide. Goldeneye was a wonderful game, but Agent Under Fire (AUF) takes the advantage of CDs by having actual voices and more sound affects (the N64 games could not hold as much information). Parents, if you buy this game for your kid, play it with him. I would rate this game PG-13."
2,Playable,"James Bond, as the N64 proved, has awesome potential for being made into a video game, with all the hi-tech gadgets, fast cars and innovative bad guys, why can't these guys make another great James Bond game? This game is, at best, mediocre, the graphics are fine, not great and not poor, just fine, sound is the same.The missions are playable, if unrealistic, you just don't get the James Bond feeling from this game, it's really a waste of time.Multiplayer can be fun however, not to the N64 Goldeneye limits, but good none the less.2 Stars"
3,Average at best,"This game is a good example of a first person shooter gone bad. The default controls are awkward (fortunately, you can change them to resemble ""Halo""), and the constant interruptions of M and R pointing out the obvious doesn't help. This game is not worth more than a rental; you might get some enjoyment out of the multi-player feature, but that's about it."
2,An almost total dissapointment,"I have to say I expected a lot from this game. I remember looking at the screenshots preview and thinking that this game would rock as HALO did. Upon starting this game for the first time I immediately noticed the akward control / movement when in first person view mode. It just felt so akward and not fluid as HALO (yeah, HALO set the bar high for FPS games). The driving sequences were good but, not nearly enough. And then I tried the multiplayer, o lord .. it just [stunk]. Needless to say, I immediately trade this game after finishing it (yeah, I'm the kind of player who would finish a game eventhough it felt like a chore). Rent it, don't buy it."
3,Freezer Team Cups,"These cups look great, but I've had 6 of them now, and they just can't last through more than a couple months of freeze/thaw cycles and the glass exterior cracks and breaks. Works perfect before the plastic housing breaks, then hits the circular file aka trash can."
3,Good fun,"In my opinion, this is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Just look at it disconsidering everything you ever read about battletech rules, and it's fine. The book is well written, rich in characters and plots, but it is on the verge of being ridiculous by batlletech combat standards. One single, unarmored person, with a vibroblade as primary weapon, with a whole battlemech BATTALION of worth of kills? I think perhaps the main character was the inpiration to the FWLM unit, the Second Oriente Hussars insignia of a person running after an Atlas with a knife."
2,An ok book in a Wonderful Series that isn't very good,I think it ttruly was a boring book except for a few scenes. It was labor trying to finish it and is not recomended
5,Great Knife,"Purchased for a Christmas gift. Timely shipping. Recipient pleased with knife's brand, size & weight. Very satisfied!"
3,Saturated pop-culture,"A disappointing book, least to me, because I found the photos too broad in the coverage. Having looked through it several times I thought it kept on verging on one of those picture books found in tourist shops with titles 'A book to remember her by'.It really is a mixed bag. The photos I liked best were those that showed the non-tourist parts of the city: the huge pole billboards along the highway, small retail units, decaying buildings and street scenes but turn a page and there's a spread of the interior of The Forum or maybe the characters in the Museum of Magic and Movies.This really should have been two books. One a photo survey of the exuberant (and vulgar) hotels and casinos, interior and exterior and book two the rest of Vegas. I would definitely go for the second and Hancock has shown with the photos in this book that he has an eye for interesting compositions and subject matter.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."
3,Its okay but not mind blowing.,"It's a smallish book with not quite the usual photos that we normally see and are familiar with. I love Las Vegas and love Las Vegas books. This one is just one of the bunch. Not really a stand out but all together not bad. Its a good to average read, photos interesting but not that memorable. Keep looking I think, there are better books out there."
2,Not as Expected from a fan of the Comics,"Honestly wasn't expecting the ""Motion Comic"" aspect, and thought that with the Success of Walking Dead, some indie company had decided to adapt Invincible.It's quite literally a nearly 1:1 Translation of the comic, word bubbles and all; sure they add voice and what constitutes ""Motion"" but ""Animated"" it isn't.Do yourself a favor....Buy the Trades, or the Omnibus Editions....though honestly, if you enjoyed/read this far you probably already have."
2,No into reading ranbow,"I was thinking this was a new cartoon I had never seen. Mtv and combined parties involved put no effort into this show with lack-luster voice acting. Just scanning in the pages panning through them. Why bother doing this project, if this is the final product."
5,Belkin AV54004 banana plugs are FANTASTIC!!!,I purchased these for my new 7.1 surround sound system. I use 12 gauge cables with these plugs - excellent fit. The plugs are very easy to install and look great. The wire is securely attached to the pin via allen ranch (taped inside an instructions booklet/insert) - so much better design than other known brands. Don't hesitate - buy these.
4,Pretty basic,"These are easy to use plugs. Certainly much, much easier than just using the speaker wire. My only mild complaint is that they are unnecessarily large."
1,Poor design - although looks good,"I purchased these to help connect my home theater.After ten transfers, I thought it was time to re-do all the speaker wiring.After assembly, the banana plug leaves a great deal of conducting material exposed.I was very concerned about using these on a powerful amplifier if something conductive(pliers, screwdriver, paperclip, etc.) was accidentally dropped on the banana plugs while in use..I removed these plugs and re-terminated the speaker wire with a more insulated banana plug."
3,Ideal for Cyrus Naim and Other Hifi Requiring BFA Plugs,"High-end European hifi (e.g. Cyrus for sure and I think Naim as well) use BFA type plugs like these where the centre of the pin is hollow and signal transfer is either through the middle of the plug or the outside or both.Because they are hollow, BFA plugs are quite easy to break off in the receptacles so that these Belkin plugs have screw-on ends may be seen as a boon. However, I would have preferred the metal part of the plugs to be in one piece. Likewise I would have preferred two screws rather than just one.However, for the price these should work fine, just be careful not to break them off or plan or disconnecting and reconnecting your speaker cables on a regular basis.One other gripe, the back-side covers / shrouds are very difficult to unscrew when new."
3,Here are my thoughts...,"I've used a ton of different banana plugs - here is my take. These are simple to setup, nice looking, and a reasonable value. Cons? The are a bit difficult to install (physically pushing them in can be a bit tight) and they are a little bit too long compared to most of these plugs on the market. They stick out (once installed) a good 2-3"" past the wall plate; a bit too far once you add in the wall plate thickness and the wires coming out the back. Just be sure that once it's behind a dresser or coming out of the wall, you have some space between that and whatever it's going to. Overall, good value and good product. 7.5 out of 10."
5,Nice banana plugs,These are very nice banana plugs. Not really much more to say. No complaints at all.
1,Get a PPA or equivalent instead,"Purchased this adapter so I could use a good old-fashioned Goldtouch folding keyboard. It was basically useless. If I typed at more than a few words per minute, it started dropping keystrokes. Even when it didn't drop them, the lag from hitting the key to seeing a reaction on screen was unbelievable. After throwing this one out, I purchased a PPA adapter (the vendor actually sent a Bytecc) here on Amazon which works great."
2,older performance possibly not remastered well,"all you have to do is also listen to the clerk's group performance of these pieces. Ockeghem is all about meaningful textures, of which this muddy remaster of a 70s performance is completely ignorant. The top voice is given prominence over the rest, and that is just not Ockeghem's style. I have a very good recording of Ockeghem's Requiem by the same group and same conductor (Bruno Turner) so I suspect things went wrong in the remastering."
4,POSITIVE REVIEW,THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN IN A CLEAR AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER. IT IS EASY TO READ AND COMPREHEND. DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
5,Simple racing fun,"Need for speed: Hot Pursuit 2 for the ps2 can be sumed up very easily. Its a fun and addicting racing game. There are 2 career modes. One has you just racing against other cars. The other involves not getting caught by the police. What really makes this game addicting is that you never feel like you're doing the samething over and over again. There are so many different types of races and challenges that each race is unique. Even the number of other drivers changes from race to race. 2 player mode (one person gets to be the cops) works great as well.I have two criticisms (and they are very small). First, I found the menu a little confusing the first time I played. Second, I don't like the game saves your name in the record book (yes, I'm very petty).It may not be the most realistic driving game, but it sure is a whole lot of fun."
5,Need for Fun? Get Need for Speed!,"This is a great game. If you are looking for a racing game, but don't know which one, pick this one. It has two modes:Hot Pursuit: race against the cops and against other people or you can even be the cops and pull over the road racers.World Racing: Your normal everyday racing mode with AWESOME cars.Both modes have a championship event tree. each event tree is like a tournament bracket, but if you lose you are not out. you just keep trying. each event (when you win it) will lead to another event with different challenges and different cars and courses to unlock. drive great cars such as the Lambourghini Murcielago, the Dodge Viper, the Mercedes Benz CLK-GTR, the McLaren F1, and so many more cars with different challenges to unlock them. As you're racing you even get great songs such as ""People That We Love"" by Bush, ""Keep It Coming"" by Uncle Kracker, and more songs.Sound: *****Graphics:*****Challenge: *****Cars: *****Fun:*****BUY THIS GAME! IT ROCKS!"
3,Fair play...,"Nothing so special in this title . If you want to seek for the best graphics , go for PC. On PS2 the graphics are a bit [worse] but still fair to play ....."
3,Need for Something,"After reading multiple reviews from multiple sources [raving] over this game, I decided to purchase it.I could have saved my money if anyone would have just bothered to mention that it plays EXACTLY the same as the mediocre game that came out 10 years ago on the 3DO.Cops are a nice twist, but get boring and annoying rather quickly, and are not enough to pull this game from its position firmly in the middle of the road."
4,This is the best racer ther is by far!!!,I just purchaesed NFS: HP2 and it is the best on by far. Everything from the cars to the tracks you race on. The AI for the cops are very aggressive and that is a plus because it puts more challenge into the game. I have made it to the point where the police chopper actually starts dropping stop sticks to slow me down. This game you got to have for the PS2 library
4,nfs ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have every NFS game they ever made! I can tell this will be the best yet the only cars i like are the MUSTHANG&Mclaren
2,Great Graphics but Bad System,This game has some of the best graphics ever. I love racing games and love to collect cars and race them for a bunch of money. I wanted to do that but no. It is stupid how they set this up to play the game. Don't get me wrong the graphics are the best except for GTA which is the best game ever. So if you want to collect Ferrari and Lambos then get a different game besides this. Good luck.
1,PS One material,"I've played the demo for this game on the Official Playstation Magazine Issue #61, and it is not what I've expected. The game looks like it could be played on the PS One...Yes there are moments that can be fun in the game...I'll stick with my demo & not buy this game."
5,Need for Speed: Hot Persuit 2,This game has lived up to its expectations. Must have for any racing fan or anyone who likes sports cars. Two player mode has changed little from the last NFS game but it is still if extremly fun!
4,For kids,"I bought it the first day it came out for PS2. But I guess I was expecting too much. Having been at GT3 for quite some time now, this game isnt serious. For a few secs, I was quite surprised at my car control..and then I figured out, you leave the steering and just press the gas, the cars still manages to do 80mph and never run off track..so its kids stuff. Braking isnt even close to what it should be, no rpm control, and the cars magically take corners at unbelievable speeds... where one should expect a 50mph cornering speed, this lets you do at 100+. It is in no way for the technically minded and serious racers. But for youngsters and people not wanting to be bothered with technicalities - its probably good..chases are fun, you get to drive exotic cars [ though none of the cars have an identity in engine sound/feel or anything else. ] Sorry about this ... I am just a messenger."
4,Best NFS ever!!!,This game is just so good its hard to describe. I love the tracks and the cars are just so awesome!! Hot pursuit mode is also really cool and I love when the police use the helicopters to try to catch you. If you want real action racing get this game!!!
4,Best Racing Game EVER!!!!,"Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 is the best racing game ever! If you are a person who's obsessed with fast cars and good graphics, than this game would be the best for you! I know every single car they have in the game and the Top Speed I tested on the straightest Track in the whole game!:<BR...>This was the best racing game ever so consider buying it."
4,Great Graphics!,I looked at a review for this game and ever since have wanted it. When I found and tried it out I was VERY impressed. The graphics are unbelievable! Helicopters drop bombs and shoot missles at you. This game gets a five star for awesome graphics and great gameplay. AWESOME GAME!!!!
5,Unbelievable,"To date this is easily the most fun ""Need for Speed"" title. Totally ungrounded in reality, this game was fun to just turn on and go as fast as absolutely possible!! As low price as this game is now there is NO reason why it shouldn't be in your library of classic games."
4,best racimg game ever,You should definetly get this game it is awsome it is off the hook!!!!!!!!!!burning rubber in the hottest sport cars in the world and getting away from cops is all about this game...
4,Wonderful Graphics!!,"I do have this game, and I love it!! It doesn't have only a few tracks to choose from,it has sooo many!!! My top three favorite cars would have to be the Porsche 911 Turbo,the Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR,and the McLaren F1 LM which is the FASTEST car on the game. It can go 240MPH on some of the tracks!! This game is so realistic. It has real-life cars and songs from real bands that you can buy on CD.I think it is the best NFS game! You can race against other people and against cops. Or you can BE THE COP!!! As you get better they throw bigger challenges at you. And as you get better you unlock new cars and tracks. I just LOVE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,good but could of been a lot better,when i heard about this game coming out i was pretty excited because i'm a pretty big fan of the nfs series. but it's a good thing that i rented it first. there are a few areas in which they could of improved it. first of all in the career mode you can't choose your car. it is predetermined by the computer which car you'll use. so all my work to unlock the 360 modena was in vain cause i could only use it in the arcade mode. another thing is that the cars can't be upgraded like they could in the past installments of the series. but one of the plus sides to the game is that it has the best cars for any ps2 game. another plus side is that you can choose which event you want to do next. Even though this is probably the best arcade racer for ps2 there is still a lot of room for improvement.
5,This Game Is Awsome,"My friend told me this ame was wonderful. He has it for the PC. So he told me to buy it as soon as it comes out. This game is the best Need For Speed yet. It features awsome graphics, police chases in the sweetest cars in he world and realistc damage. Also it features tune ups, Reapirs, Paint jobs, etc. So if you want a realistic game I would recommend Need For Speed Hot Pursuit for the Playstation 2..."
2,'HOT' Pursuit? Anything but........,"This game has one main thing going for it. Graphics. The soundtrack is rather lacking (unless you like rock/metal and ONLY rock/metal). The physics of the game aren't too crash hot (don't really get a 'feel' for the speed you are doing). And the controls?? EVERY car slides across the track and cornering is especially difficult because of sluggish response time from the controls. As for the track layout some tracks are ok but unlike previous installs of NFS the tracks seem to 'blend' together (i.e. there's nothing that makes one track stand out from another). Visibility on certain tracks is rather bad as at some points along the track you cannot see where the next corner is until you are crashing into it. I've spent in excess of 10 hours playing this game and getting a feel for it and I'd have to say that it's dissapointing. If you want a game that gives you a feel for speed as well as handling of different cars, I'd recommend NFS: High Stakes."
2,a waste of money,"i really did not like this game for many reasons. for one thing it is not very realistic. i have a v12 vanquih and i cant out run the cops in a corvette z06, and i reccomend that you choose the extreme handling versus the classic handling. in extreme handling you are able to move the car much better. also there are times when you make a jump and the game freezes and it goes around your car this can get really annoying. there are also short cuts since you race on a road courses these can get really annoying because you can be in first then last because you didnt take the short cut. it seems that EA spent more money on the music(which isnt very good) than on the game. the graphics are nicely done and the cars are pretty cool but why spend 50 dollars to buy this game when you can spend 20 dollars and buy gran turismo 3 a much better racing game"
2,same old thing,"this is just another racing game. like most games, it starts out fun and then gets so difficult so quickly that the whole experience is ruined. i like the first couple of levels, then it's just too hard. buy this if you really need a racing game, i'm not saying there's a better one out there. i played it maybe 5 hours total over the course of 2 weeks. i threw my controler at the tv so many times i can't believe it didn't break. i'd gladly trade this game for a 12-pack of Coors in bottles. (...)"
4,NFS Should feel proud,This is a great game. I like it better than GT3 to tell you the truth. If you want realism than get the GT3 first and then buy NFSHP2. But for me the realism of GT3 is boring. The cars are too lumbersome and they dont handle well. And that is what i like about NFSHP2 The cars handle ok and they handle more..fakely. But thats what i like. and in GT3 you cant do spins well and you cant hit many things. In NFSHP2 you can do all the spins you want and you can beat up a 1.5 million dollar CLK GTR if you would like. I also like the exotic cars they put in this game. That is something also that GT3 doesnst have. I am a big racing and car fan and i love my ferraris/lotus/lamborghini/Mercedes/Bmw and so on. So this game does it for me. So if your an exotic car buff and like a cool game.this is the one for you
2,Disappointed with Hot Pursuit 2,"I was really disappointed with this game. The cops aren't a threat at all even on the highest difficulty setting, the ""damage"" your car takes is purely cosmetic and has no bearing on the performance of your car, and the physics are terrible. You hit an oncoming car head on and you jump over it. Yeah right."
4,VERY GOOD GAME,this is a really good game i will put it into topics graphics 5/5 the graphics are great handling 4/5 handling is ok but cud use inprovement damage 2/5 ur car can get damaged but it dont impede performace cars 4/5 cars r good but u have 2 unlock v good ones gameplay 4/5 overall 4/5 its a fun game and u shud buy it
3,para un niño esta biem,ok este juego espara un niño pequeño pero para mi los carros no seven biem me gustan los juegos como si fueran reales que se escuchen sus mutores de cada carro pero esto no me gusto yo te recomiendo need for speed most wanted for ps2 eso si es un juego mi favorito
5,NFS' BEST GAME EVER,"this is their best game ever. both undergrounds and carbon doesn't even compare to this game and never will. u get to play 49 cars, 30 races and several cop cars. u get to play with a friend. graphics are great. i like some of the music on there. u get to choose your players names(player 1 and 2)."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"After reading this book, I am compelled to warn other would-be buyers to save their money. This is a book that does not live up to its title and seems to be riddled with factual and syntactical errors. Moreover, when I researched the author, I was intrigued to find out he is not an archaeologist or scholar at all but rather an M.D.(ENT) masquerading as an expert in archaeology. And, to top it off, it appears that the book is published by a press that specializes in travel books and cook books, not in serious subjects like archaeology. For those interested in the archaeology of Florida, I recommend the numerious well-written and well-researched books by the experts at the University of Florida or Florida State. Dr. Brown, the ear, nose and throat specialist, is simply out of his element in this book."
5,Florida's Fossils,"This book provides a well-rounded introduction for anyone who wishes to collect fossils in Florida and doesn't want to or can't collect in the typical tourist areas. On our recent vacation,from information in the book, we decided on a river, found the locale mentioned and came away with some specimens that look to be promising when we get a chance to clean them. The auther writes to someone that has never collected in Florida, developing the geology, with clear diagrams and photographs of some fossils that could be found."
4,BOO! 18 Wheeler STINKS!,"There is completly no point in this game. This game is so easy. You would think it would be hard to do, but it's simple. I beat it in less than a hour. Parking mode is stupid because you get a few seconds to park in a square, that's far away. Rent it first, you probably would not like it. If you buy it first, you will regret it. It's a thumbs down game."
1,This Game Stinks!!!,"This is the most boring game I have played in my lifetime! In the arcade mode of the game you have to drive four stretches of highway, after you finish with all of the four stretches you finish the whole Arcade mode. After you finish the Arcade mode you will win another trucker, and then you can do the whole thing over, over and over again. BORING!!!I tout the only challenge of the game was the Parking mode, in the parking mode you have to park your truck in four diffrent locationsIn conclution this game is a HUGE dissapointment!!!"
2,This game is a total rip off!!!!!!!,"Ok this game is the same game that is at the arcade. Therefore, you can beat this game like in 20 min max. Well the arcade part of it, it also has a parking option witch [is bad] because its like impossible to do well at least level 4 is. But dont get me wrong the graphics in this game a great, but one of the most important factors is missing the fun factor."
4,pretty bad,this game may look cool but when you start to play it it gets boring I beat it in an hour without cheat codes you can buy it but rent it first before you buy it just to see if you like it
2,boring,When I got 18 wheeler i thoght it whould be more difrent from the arcade game. And i hoped i would get more freedom but your always on a track with a time limet. and really it only has 2 modes that get really boring.
3,It's stinks,It's to short and way to easy.It took me not a week but a hour to beet it.You would think it would be better than that.
3,maybe buy it,"the arcade game is fun where you drive across the country but it only has four places to drive to (and you would not reach your destination that fast) it has okay gameplay butt as brett johnson said it dosent consist of much, besides arcade you have parking and score attack, parking is fun there are six levels and you are parking in five different places on each level. but score attack is stupid you drive around a track three times avoiding all the the cars except the bouns cars. when i bought this game i thught it would have more to choose from so unless you like games you will get board of after half an hou steer clear of this game"
3,It's a good game but...,"I found this game, full package, for $2. I bought it knowing the reviews for it. I love the Big Mutha Trucker series and I like the simulation of driving a semi. I used the Gameshark for the game on Gamecube to this game. I did really like it and then bam, you win. Only four levels on this game. They should of developed ten levels. It is fun playing though."
5,Excellent value!,"This product is definitely worth the money.This product rarely ever causes problems.Definitely better than the official Controller Pak. So what if it isn't licensed? It is an awesome product. The official Controller pak doesn't have enough memory.Game saves can be as much as 122 pages! It can only hold 123!Then you gotta get another Controller Pak. But with the Memory Card Plus,your problems are over. Four times the memory for less than half the price.C'mon,think about it!With a Controller Pak,you are gonna end up wasting money on more Controller Paks. The Memory Card Plus is your solution.Never again have prolems with ""not enough memory"". One of the best accesories on the market."
1,This thing stinks,I bought this memory card because of its value. I got it and it never would work. All my games read it as a curupt memory card and i could not save anything to it. I then went and bought a second one and it also had problems. Once i would save the game it would erase itself. I finally went out and bought the nintendo memory pac with which i have had no problems. I ended up spending a lot of money. I do not recommend this memory card.
1,Save money and lose saved games.,"I've had the disturbing experience of using this product on my N64 home system. I've realized that perhaps my view to save money on the little things counted, however, I was wrong. I bought this pak (with a nice case too) and the thing saved my games, but sometimes it didn't, I guess it was having a bad day. Anywhich way, this thing is unreliable at best and was cheaply made. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this and but the N64 one, because you don't want to have to restart a game like Turok 2 from the beginning now do you?"
1,This thing is a piece of junk,"Sup doggs. I'm with the guy from NY. I had nearly beat THPS 2 when mine broke. (I dropped it). So i bought another one. I didn't do nothing to it and it broke. The only thing I did with it is take it outside to walk to my friends house. So I almost beat the game 2 times. Luckily my friend has a quality one and we managed to save it on his. Also, dont by NUBY brand.Peace out brothaz!!!"
4,Garage lift for truck Camper shell,"Have had this for a couple years and it is a great product. I use it to lift and store my camper shell (topper) during the summer months. Takes some what of an anal effort to set it up correctly, so if ya can't do that then don't buy or get help with it. Once it is set up it is great."
2,Just ok,"My fault! I thought this would be a book with more of a spiritual perspective. Might be better for a ""business man"""
4,Multidisciplinary,What I liked most about this book was it's multidisciplinary aproach and down-to-earth explanations. Wer good dravings of the procedures. It lost one star since it was not easy to find information by surgical procedure.
3,Decent Pirate Game....,"Though this game was moderately hyped I was looking forward to it being a fan of the Pirate genre. The first person aspect of the game is okay, but takes a while to get good at the insane camera angles and there is considerable clipping. The sea battles are pretty good and the story is moderately entertaining. Most parts of the game are really easy which is good if you are 12 or just lousy at most video games like I am. But some parts are really fustrating and confusing. Overall it could have been a much better game..."
2,SESEME STREET PIRATES,"I rented this game in hopes of finally a good first person game other than halo for xbox but was truly dissapointed. The graphics are amazing but storyline and fluidness of the game was not present much at all. Also a s a pirate i don't expect to be fighting giant crab creatures and gorrillas. Also just over all it was pretty plain. What could have been cool if they had more of an interactive enviorment than just forward, kill bad guy, forward, kill another bad guy , get on boat , shoot bad guy boat, get off boat , kill bad guy , etc... Don't expect much of a challenge with this game."
1,Not even Close to Sea Dogs,"I am a huge fan of the pirate game genre, so I was excited to see this game in the XBOX section of the store. I have owned most pirate games for the PC.If you're expecting Sea Dogs or anything close to the old Pirates game on the PC, with Pirates - The Legend of Black Kat, you will be as disappointed as I was with this game.This game might be good for kids learning to play video games, although it is violent. Since I am not a kid, I grew bored of this game after an hour. I will probably never play it again.The game play is extremely linear.It would be a good game for elementary school children, if it didn't have all the violence.Basically it's not kid enough for kids and not adult enough for adults. It's just plain bad.If you need a crummy game fix, buy it at Amazon. They have the lowest price anywhere for this game."
1,Lame,"This game is way too easy. If it weren't for the stacked main character I'd have returned this game on day one.The graphics are weak, very arcade-y and not at all what I expect from an Xbox title. The land-based game play is just mindless button-mashing until everything is dead. The sea-based missions are sort of ok, but only because there's an incredible dearth of sea-based games. Anything even halfway decent would make this game truly forgettable.It is fun to upgrade your ship from a crummy little barque to a lumbering man-o-war. Once you've done that though, forget about challenge. With the big ships, you could sink an island.This game _could_ be ok for young people, beginners, or people who are normally bad at games and want to feel like they're good at games. Not that being good at games is worth anything, it's just that if you are, you'll rip through this game in a couple days and realize it wasn't really that much fun."
5,Great medical detective biography,"An informative book on Ebola, Lassa fever, HIV, Legionnaires' and the role of doctors in fighting these diseases. I felt like I was living through the dilemmas faced by these employees of CDC. The book read like a detective novel because it shows the persistent tracking of clues to stop the spread as well as the treatment options of diseases. The book was enjoyable despite the sad, honest portrayal of the living conditions and politics that influence the spread of diseases. It enlightened me about the need for dedicated scientists who are willing to cooperate to serve mankind despite conflicting world political leaders. I would highly recommend it for the scientific reader who enjoys unraveling a mystery or reading biographies by scientists!"
5,Feel like a different person,"I was turned on to Choline many years ago, has always helped me with relaxation and concentration. My husband more recently started taking pramiracetam,Pramiracetam Bulk Powder 25 Gramsto help him focus on a big project for work. Turns out when you combine it with choline the effects are increased significantly. I've been more alert and ""switched on"" during the day, and able to relax more easily I think, in social situations. A good one two punch!"
5,Really helps with anxiety,Both my mate and I suffer from anxiety. For years wesquabbled when one or both of us felt uptight. By using inositol/choline we are getting along better and sleeping better.
4,Source Naturals Inositol & Choline,I am very satisfied with this product. Good quality and timely shipping. I would recommend this to friends. The only thing I didn't like was that the pills were huge!
2,HORSE PILLS!!!!!,"Works but I have to crush the tablets, I have never seen tablets so big, I will not buy again, I would prefer smaller dosage for a pill that can be swallowed"
2,Oh Dear,"This CD was a big disappointment for me, after the excellent ""World to Come"". The greatest part of this CD consists of musical accompaniment to spoken word; poetry if you like. This is a combination that I dislike, so I suppose responses will depend on taste. But I found relatively little music per se on this CD. It gets better as the CD goes on; there is some music that is there for its own sake, recalling some of the excellence of Beiser's other work. Overall, the execution is excellent, and the sounds are pleasant enough to offer some gratification in listening. I will be waiting for Beiser's next CD."
4,GREAT rendition of the classic,"this has got the classic and broughten it to another level. the graphics are great, and cute, and there is great play control, short load times, and a fun atmosphere throughout the game. the levels are really cool and the game is worth checking out. it is definately worth your money because since playstation is inteneded for more of a mature audience, there have been a lack of great games for all ages. there is Jak and daxter, an under rated flawless platformer, and now we have pac man world 2 to add to the collection. this one improves upon the original for the PSX, graphics and gameplay wise. try this game out if you even have a hint of love for the original arcade version."
4,Amazingly Addictive...,"When buying it, I wasn't expecting much. Other Pac Man games are fun, but tend to get boring after a while. This one is SO not boring! There are many levels that you go through, and there's cool things to do even after you finish the game. The controls are fairly simple once you get used to them. The creativity envolved in the levels are clearly shown. Each level is very deifferent from the last and adds a lot of variety. This is a great game for everyone! I recommend it for all ages."
4,simple and fun!,"This game is awesome. The graphics are well done, and the game play is simple and fun. Perfect for any gamer who is average (like me!)"
1,Another Bad Sequel - Pac Man World 2,"I was disappointed with Pac-Man World 2. The game developers took out the elements which made Pac Man World 1 successful. Although the environment was 2D in Pac Man World 1, the game was action packed and challenging with high replay value.For the sequel, they tried to combine elements from other games (such as the free-roaming environment of RayMan and the fast-paced action and timed sequences of Crash Bandicoot). They did not succeed in either attempt.There are 4 games to unlock by completing the levels. Original Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Pac Attack and PacMania. If you already have a retro gaming compilation or the Namco Museum then you already have these games. Why didn't they include games such as Super PacMan or PacMan Jr?The camera angles are horrible and this element alone is what destroys the game. There is NO desire to replay levels to collect all the items or to better your time or increase your points.DO NOT buy this game. It is a rental at best..."
5,Pac Man World 2,"I recieved my game today and have not stopped playing it or should I say that I am still trying to get past the third challenge (lol). No scratches, clear, and in good condition (Thank you)."
5,great game,this game is one of the best games ive ever played before i thought 1/3 were good but this is better.
1,Butler Flip OPen scope covers,Useless product and of extremely poor quality. Front flip up lost (broken off) during first deer stalk. A most definite: DON'T BUY!
2,Nice Design but cheap,I grew up with these scope caps. Always loved them. I just bought the 02A for a Trijicon 1-4x24 worn by a Wilson AR15 in 6.8. On the first day of use the open cap snagged on pants and the lid broke off.
5,"A beautiful, beautiful, MOVING book",This is one of those books that can change your life. The photos are so totally inspiring. This book will be on all of my friends' coffee tables.
4,it is great and smell great too,it is a great natrual soap but i like african raw black soap better . it has more moisturing than this soap. African black soap is high in glyernic than this soap. Through you may have to carefully keep African raw soap closed because of glernic and it doesn't have scent as pleasent like that soap. I still choose african raw soap because it is 100% real directly from Ghana made with shea and cocoa.
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting a chocolate smelling soap and after paying 3 times the cost of the soap to have it shipped I was sorely disappointed. There is not much more to it other than it does lather very nice.
3,Not what I have expected!,"It dryes my skin and it melts very easy. It doesn't smell bad at all, and I appreciate this product jut because is natural. But, not for my skin, definitelly!"
5,Powerful and uplifting,"Jefferson Scott does it again with the Firebrand team! Once again he provides an awesome wit, along with sometimes a strange sense of humor that I appreciate. And he once again shows how a member or two might show some weaknesses. You might also want to look for hints of Veggie Tales in this thriller.Eloise sends the team to Sudan, where the Firebrand team looks to free women and children who are slaves. Jason deals with the subject of revenge and also how to respond to certain situations like a true leader. You also find Rachel wishing to seek retribution in certain places of this book. Garth and Lewis never fail to crack me up throughout the book, and Lewis brings along his friend, Chunky. It also has a beautiful Christian witness through everything the team encounters. This book has some awesome action the whole way through the book. It also deals immensely with grace and mercy and forgiveness. I can't wait for the next book in this series! Give us more, Mr. Scott!"
4,Is a werewolf stalking Louisiana? Not your average romance....,"Under a raging moon.....Nobody had to tell Sylvie Peabody some things were beyond understanding. After all, she was really a witch - a witch of uncommon power. But even she was powerless to explain the nightmare that gripped the town of Stagwater whenever the full moon approached. Was it really possible that a werewolf was stalking the Louisiana night? And was it coincidence the horror had begun when the mysterious Rand Garner bought that old estate on the edge of town? Sylvie knew she must not fall prey to his lethal charm and animal grace. Yet some force beyond her control meant that nothing could keep her from him -- not even her rising terror.....This book is part of a four part series about The Circle - four friends with magical gifts, each finding love to last an eternity."
2,Disappionting,"I was eagerly anticipating this CD. But alas it was not what I expected. There is a lot of talking that distracts from the music, making it hard to relax to."
2,Do not overload...,"I like to carry a lot of stuff on my 3.5 mile commute. On the 10th trip I had a laptop, one book and some clothes and the plastic clip broke when I hit a bump. I was very disappointed. I shopping for a different brand now. Can we get some info on weight capacity for any of these???"
5,wanna get into publishing? Read this book.,"I really like Diana's account of her life with Deutsch. If you want to get into publishing and would like an overview, this is a good start. Whether as a writer, an editor or a publisher, this wonderfully written memoir has stories for everybody.It is also a really good mix between publishing and real life (although most publishers probably feel they don't have a real life anymore)... There is love, drama, excitement, everything a good biography should have. Plus all the stories from Diana's editorial life.Get it, read it, know yer publishing business."
5,Great Game,I bought this game because the other two EA sports Big games (ssx and NBA street) were great. I was not disapointed. This game has great graphics and great game play. This is so much better then arctic thunder. Anyone that likes arcade racing games should get this game.
4,Say what?,"This game is not as hard nor is it as horrible as some people claim. In fact, after a couple of weeks of gameplay I was able to beat all levels comfortably.The graphics is not that bad. It may have some polygon-like shapes, however, that does not make it a horrible game. The graphics were cool and fairly realistic.There are numerous stunts, levels, characters, and shortcuts to explore. Overall, it was fun to play and my only real complaint is that there aren't enough levels to play around with."
3,sled storm ?,"Sled Storm?, a better title would be SSX 3, or Jet Moto tricky.The solid format of a quality snowmobile racer found on the original PSone version of this title is non-existant for the PS2 version. Thanks alot EA you blew it! This title is now an over the top,non realistic,trick based,stunt race on fantasy courses.What happened over at EA canada? did you guys change your name to EA BIG because thats how much crossover commercialism your willing to do. ..."
5,cool,i think game is cool because it has matthew lillards voice in it matthew lillard is so [good looking] love ya matt...)!...
1,dude,i put the game in and my playstation blew up scaring my pretty face for life other than that a great game
2,Sled Stink,"Shame on you EA sports, Shame on you BIG, you have managed to destroy and bring shame upon the original PSone version. In EA sports BIG endevour to please SSX fans and snowmobile fans, they ruined it for both & everyone. I bought this game because of the early screen shots I have seen posted @ gamespot. Those pictures are not in this game, instead we get SSX like tracks (red lines and all) that are freakin weird (stupid). I will never trust EA BIG again, why should all thier games be of the same exact concept? I cant describe the disapointment I feel, I expected this version to have really good sleds (it doesn't) and really good environments (it doesn't) it does have really good graphics and sound, but thats not enough to forgive the unrealistic scooters that pose as sleds, and the hauntingly freakish (Polarfest)locations that spoil this title.To sum up this review Sled storm PS2 stinks."
1,Went to far,they just should have stayed with sled storm 1. Sledstorm 2 has very narrow tracks which are almost impossible to stay on.the only good thing about it is that you select the driver then the vehicle. So if you hate really challenging games stay away from this one.
1,zzzzzzzz...,"For some reason, EA BIG decided to make a third SSX game, only involving snowmobiles instead of snowboards. If you decide to explore the tracks looking for shortcuts, you will find yourself crashing upon contact with thin air. The tracks themselves are [similiar to] SSX tracks, with the ever-present clown and carnival theme that EA BIG loves to incorporate in all their racing games. the snowmobiles sound like garbage, the graphics are polygons. Crashing into thin air is the real frustrating part... there is an invisible barrier on both sides, on top and under the linear track that forces the driver to run the track like a roller coaster. this game is garbage, plain and simple. The only demographic I think this CD ROM would satisfy are kids under the age of seven. SSX was good, but EA BIG is really running the linear roller-coaster type racing games into the ground fast."
2,over priced battery,"After purchasing the battery I discovered it could have been purchased locally for $20.00 less. Steve at Ron's Hardware, Amazon's distributor for the battery, was very condescending and insulting that I would purchase something for more than I should have."
4,Good Book,I am finding the viewpoint of this book to be very interesting. it has some very strong viewpoint of what happened on 9/11 2001.
1,Imitation moonbat,The logic is so twisted you'd swear this book was written by a liberal antiwar moonbat. A virtual master of using quotes out of context. Sad and scary. This is the mentality we are facing.
4,Entertaining but cheesy fun,"I remember this show back when it was on in the mid 90s and loved the show then. I was a huge Dudikoff fan and just love the car. It doesn't take itself seriously either. I have enjoyed watching the show again as I don't recall any of it and even though it can be cheesy at times, especially the old nintendo soundtrack, it is still fun to watch. I am almost done watching it again and have begun though to notice some of the same driving footage repeated in episodes but think a lot of shows similar would have the same problem. I would recommend though for some cheesy entertainment plus can't beat the price."
4,"Great Series, hot car!","I really liked this show and feel it had the potential to go more than one season. The one-star ding is for the lousy packaging, I had to replace the original case with one able to hold four disks on separate spindles. No biggie, but if I can afford these cases so could the manufacturers.Quoth the Raven..."
1,What a Complete RipOff!,It appears these people never saw the Stingray series in the 80s That's where most of the vehicles were taken from. I also noticed Nick Mancuso Driving the vehicles the editing is really lousy especially some scenes are blurred to try to make the footage from Stingray look new. Also there was a helicopter explosion taken from wiseguy as well. If they are going to make a series use real vehicles not recycled footage from old shows.
4,undigested wright,"In 2003 I did what many others did, I bought a model of the 1903 flyer and built it with my daughter, and I found a great book on the Wrights. The book, Visions of a Flying Machine by Peter Jakob created something of a small obsession within me about the Wrights' creative process. The massive two volume set of thier papers edited by Mcfarland has begun to satisfy this need to understand. It is beautiful. It could have been sewn in signatures however, instead of being bound like a paperback with a hard cover."
3,Where is the case?,"From this picture I thought the set came in this case which I thought was a very nice feature. No case was included, just the practice drum set. I got it for my Grandson and I am sure he will enjoy the set but Grandma was expecting a case to put it in. Unless you are a musical person and you saw the picture you might think the same thing or I guess you might think were is the practice drum set. I think they should make it clear that the case is not included."
1,Deserves less than one star...,"This is my first Amazon.com review. The complete and utter unworthiness of this game is the motivation for this review. This game absolutely sucks. I bought it expecting ""Excitebike 64"" and then some, but this game does not come close. Don't even think of buying this game if you've played Excitebike 64, you'll be [angry]like me."
5,A special thought from a Vietnamese reader of this book.,"I'm a Vietnamese person that lived in Vietnam most of my life. The war ended before i was even borned. Of course living in a Communist country like Vietnam whatever i learn or read about the war are totally different . This book gives me a really good view about what happened and the way Americans look at the war. The author even has great knowledge about Buddhism , his Vietnamese and French are pretty good also . I enjoyed this book a lot , It reminds me about my country and thanks for such a terrific story."
1,What a pain,"I hear that this is a great wrist brace but I will never know for sure - Wellgate will not ship to my location (Hawaii). We have been a State for 50+ years - we have USPS, UPS and FEDEX just like the rest of the US - our money is even the same color! What's the problem, folks?"
1,Pretty but Worthless,"When I first bought these braces I was so happy to have something attractive for a woman. But they are truly worthless. They give little or no good support. For me, they do not work. My doctor was appalled at them when she saw them. We had a good laugh over it and at me for being so gullible! They are so flexible they might as well not even exist.However I think they are better than nothing."
3,Sturdy but itchy,I bought these for my wife to use while sleeping because she tend to bend her wrist hard at night. They are a good sturdy wrist support that are easy to use and put on but she complained that they are itchy. They need to improve the comfort of the fabric.
5,Good support,"Thought it was uncomfortable and too stiff at first but once I got used to it, I love it. It supports my wrist to prevent further injury(main reason for getting it) and now my wrist has stopped hurting. I can wear it the whole time at work."
4,Good purchase,"The design is very nice, the product has good quality, good stitches and velcro, and it doesn't look as bulky as other wrist supports I've seen. The only thing is that, although it does inmobilize the wrist, it feels a bit loose around it. Since I was used to an elastic band this was something I had to get used to. Overall a good product, I would recommend it."
2,"Ouch, But Maybe It's My Injury?","The brace felt comfortable and supportive when I initially put it on, but after wearing it several hours, the part of my hand around my thumb was very sore and bruising occurred. I'm in recovery from breaking my wrist 11 weeks prior, and bought it to sleep in. I waited a few days, slept w/it on one night & again, soreness & bruising. So, maybe it's good for some injuries or pain, but not for mine."
2,TOO LARGE and PAINFUL to WEAR,"These wrist support was too large and painful to wear on my right hand. I think it's made for a giant, maybe Jack would like it while he climbing the beanstalk. I returned it with no problem from Amazon. It's a great place to shop and saves the gas need to go shopping now if we had bazaars and bargaining, I'd be out there in a minute. :-)"
5,Excellent choice,My work and study schedule often leaves my hand strained and tired. This brace gave my wrist the required support to keep it from hurting while I type or lift heavy things. I love to wear the wrist at night and by morning my wrist is all relaxed and rejuvenated. Excellent product.
5,Used every day and night for a year... Still good.,"I have pretty bad Carpal tunnel, and especially bad during pregnancy, so I bought these and started sleeping in them every night. They don't make me feel closterphobic like other braces do. It's been over a year and unfortunately they are starting to smell and I have no clue how to clean them..HOWEVEVER I do recommend, and i love them!"
4,BEST I'VE EVER USED; MUST FOR WOMEN W/CTS,"I could sing the praises of this product all day long. I've used a number of different splints, seeking relief from carpol tunnel. When I found this brand, I could have cried, the difference was so profound. It's made to fit the curve of a woman's hand, and is SO much more comfortable, than any other splint I've tried. I DID feel the velcro wore out pretty fast. I use mine mostly for sleeping, and they're only about 8 months old, and the velcro is shot. But if you're suffering from cts, and are a woman, I'd say buy this as fast as you can. Walmart has them."
5,Awesome support,This is the second time I have purchased this product. It has really alleviated my wrist pain when I use it every night during my sleep. I do not use it during my day but I am sure it would help further if I was allowed too. I highly recommend this brace for its comfort and fit.
2,"better than nothing, not great","I lost my originally prescribed wrist brace so I bought one of these. It is definitely inferior. The thing I noticed most after purchase is the length. My old one was longer, came to approximately half way down my forearm. This one is sufficient but not the best. It would work better while doing activities since it still allows movement. Assists but doesn't proved enough relief from carpal tunnel."
4,Almost perfect,"I love it - the fabric is soft, the velcro strap is well hidden, it looks good to the eye and it fits like a glove. It would have been perfect if the fabric is breathable!"
3,"Easy to sleep in, not as effective as the ACE brand we have","We have an older ACE brand carpal tunnel syndrome brace that does help treat the carpal tunnel pain. But it is very stiff and sturdy, you cannot really sleep in it.I ordered this brace because everyone on Amazon said it was easy to sleep in. In trying both braces side by side for a week, the Wellgate for Women is smaller, softer and can be used during sleep. The Ace is larger, stiffer and cannot be worn while sleeping.Our final verdict is that you heal faster with the ACE brace. I am now using the ACE brace during the day and the Wellgate at night.The Wellgate is so inexpensive, why not get one to use at bedtime."
5,AAAHHHHHH,"Just received this wrist support and its lightweight but sturdy. It supports my wrist nicely while still allowing me to type as I am right now. I have De Quervain's Tendinitis and borderline Carpal Tunnel in my right hand due to typing for 25 years and this relieves the pain as well as makes sleeping much more comfortable. Prior to this support, I couldn't find a comfortable position for my hand, therefore I really didn't sleep well because I was in pain. I highly recommend this support to anyone with the same problems I have."
5,Great wrist support,Great slim fit wrist support - for small hands. I wear them at night. Might be a little thick to type with because straps are on underside.
4,Great Support,"This brace fits well and provides great support, which has helped tremendously with the pain in my hand and wrist. This is slimmer than many that I've seen, but still is a bit bulky under my sweater sleeves. My button shirt sleeves will not button over the brace."
1,"Comfortable, but ineffective","Purchased this for my wife, who suffers with frequent bouts of tendonitus. At first, she stated it was very comfortable, and was happy with it. After using it for a little while, she noticed it was not as effective as others, as it was too short and did not support the entire wrist."
4,It's a nice compromise-- Better buy two,"I like that it is lightweight and not overly movement-oppressive. I was able to bend the center support a little bit to provide just a little more pressure at the heel of my hand, which brought better relief. It's a compromise. More restricted movement provides better relief, but leaves me less comfortable and with less strength to perform my tasks. It is light in color, so it immediately shows dirt and moisture, but it washes nicely. I just put it in a lingerie bag and throw it in with a white load, and let it air dry. I ended up getting a second one so that I could rotate them through the wash with less down-time."
3,one size does NOT fit all,"all i have to say is, one size does NOT fit all.other than that, it has a nice design and its a great product... but i gave it 3 star cause the item is a little tight on me. ..."
2,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this wrist brace because I have small hands and wrists. There is very little adjustment. My hand is so small that I couldn't get the palmer stay even close to touching, so I basically had no support. The palmer stay is a cheap piece of plastic (feels like a plastic fork with tines), and not adjustable. I have returned both of these wrist supports and will look for something that actually does provide support"
5,Excellent fit,"I tripped and fell in my backyard, and hurt both wrists. My physical therapist suggested I get wrist braces to wear at night that have plastic panels or ""boning"" to keep me from over-extending my wrists while I sleep. I went to four different places to find a pair, including medical supply stores and drug stores. Nothing fit. I am 5' 4"", with smallish hands. Everything I saw was too big or too long, even in the smallest size. These fit perfectly. They don't feel as bulky around the hand and the palm area isn't as tall as the others I had tried, so it's easier to use your fingers. They are comfortable and even attractive. Even though they fit me, there is enough room for wider wrists and hands, with two velcro straps that make it easy to adjust the width, and a fabric panel inside that protects your wrists from the velcro. Nice touch."
1,This wrist brace is really uncomfortable,I would rather not wear anything and bear with the pain. It's stiff and rubs horribly against the top of my thumb pad. I would not recommend this wrist support. It's a torture device.
5,Good buy,The wrist support was exactly as advertised. Delivery was timely. I have worn both a right and left for over a month. They hold up and are washable. Very satisfied!
4,good,I bought one of this product and one of Mueller Fitted Right Wrist. I like both. however I felt that Fitted is more comfortable in the hand area. But over all I will suggest this product to other
4,Did the job but left bruising.,"I bought this wrist brace after the birth of my son when my wrist began hurting from the strain of breast feeding, pushing a double stroller, and holding my son. I have small hands and the brace fit well but after a day of wear a ring of bruising showed up around the thumb hole. I continue to wear the brace as I prefer the bruising to the wrist strain but I wish the thumb hole was a bit larger."
3,Too big for those with small wrists,"I have really small wrists (~5 1/4 inch diameter) so I had to cut the straps down to get a better fit. Also, the part that circles between thumb and pointer can be a bit bothersome because I have to pull it so tight to fit and it cuts in a bit. Also, a darker color would be preferable because it's worn on the hand and touches everything you touch. Still, it's helped a lot especially when I sleep in it. I had tried other wrist braces but they were all way too big. Maybe I need a child's sized brace!"
4,Small hand and wrist dream,I have a 5 1/2 inch wrist. My hands are small as well. I never could get a brace to fit. This brace is the only one that actually fits well enough to perform as it should. I bought my first Wellgate brace in 2008 and I'm still wearing it! I've had 3 years of great performance out my wrist supports.
4,Does what it said..,"When I began wearing this it was quite uncomfortable trying to type on my keyboard at work....my first thought was that I wanted to take it off. But then I guessed that the reason it felt so uncomfortable was because I'd been holding my wrist in the wrong position for so long. So I stuck with it. And after only a weeks time I felt less and less pain in my hand and arm, just like it said I would.Overall, I recommend it and agree it does the job it says it will. I am very happy with the results."
5,Great wrist guard!,"Great product for women with small wrists! My wrists hurt from typing, so I wear these while I use the computer which helps tremendously!"
4,Pregnancy carpel tunnel syndrome,"I purchased two braces. One for pregnancy-induced carpel tunnel syndrome for my left hand, and one for a sore right wrist from a fall. The left brace seems to have nearly cured my carpel tunnel - the tingling/numbness is much better. Not sure if it's the brace or just time that cured it. I wear the right brace at night, and it really stabilizes my wrist. Both braces are lightweight and very comfortable. I can do anything while wearing them, including caring for my newborn son. I definitely recommend this product."
5,"Ordered it for my mum, it works.",mum had a carpel tunnel on her left arm. This glove has mitigated the issue dramatically. The sleeping hand (numb) has gone but pain is still there.
4,Well-made product that works well,I've been using this for about 2-3 weeks now and it is holding up well so far. I only use it at night while sleeping and it does help my wrist be pain-free for the hours after taking it off. (My wrist started hurting about a month after my first baby was born and I'm guessing it's carpal tunnel though I've never discussed it with a doctor.) It's comfortable enough to wear to sleep but I take it off during the day because it feels too restrictive. Con: It does make my wrist clammy on warmer nights. I've washed it twice - on handwash/delicate setting and then air dried.
3,Wrist guard,The guard is a little small and only goes half way down my wrist. I am using it. But it sometimes feels like it cuts off circulation.
5,Excellent wrist support,"This is an excellent wrist support and I believe it will work for many different conditions such as carpel tunnel, tendinitis and even lymphadema. It is a very nice looking and comfortable brace that is quite easy to slip on and off. I thought I had carpel tunnel but it turned out to be a thumb injury to the wrist - de Quervain's tenosynovitis. And I also have lymphadema in that arm. This brace truly made a difference in the pain and comfort level both during the day and for sleeping. I highly recommend it."
3,Does not fit all... and a little hot!,"I bought this for tendonitis in my wrist and thought that design was great... it's a little uncomfortable around my thumb as i believe the sizing to be for very small women rather than average. Also, the inside has a sueded material that while comfortable, has caused some sweating of my palm and i'm afraid it will smell. But overall it's a fair product."
3,"A ""flat"" read.","I read Tillman's Warriors and Dauntless, and both were good, interesting, exciting reads. Hellcats is a labor to get through. There is not enough development of the characters, and some actually are introduced for a very short time then never again. This book seemed as it were almost an ""insiders"" book with your personal expercience as a World War II USN aviator filling in the missing emotions and visual impact of flying in the Pacific combat area. There was nothing that really grabbed me. The characters are flat and one-dimensional. It is an okay book; not bad not good."
3,YOU NEED TO COP THIS ALBUM,As hot as Jay-Z's Black album. A classic like Nas'Illmatic.Look past the color of his skin. The kid is nice.
4,Jin - The Emcee's Properganda,"Following up last years ""The Rest Is History"", Jin decided to take the independent route with this album. ""Jin Presents The Emcee's Properganda"" was released almost a year apart from his debut.1. The Emcee (Skit)2. Perspectives - 4.5/53. Top 5 (Dead or Alive) - 4.5/54. Mr. Popular - 4/55. My First Time - 5/5 (Great Track)6. Properganda - 3.5/57. No More Fans - 5/58. G.O.L.D.E.N. - 3.5/59. Foolish Little Girls - 4/510. The Craftiest (Skit)11. 100 Thousand Sold Part 2 - 4.5/512. No Concept (Featuring YungMAC & LS) - 4/513. Carpe Diem - 4.5/514. It's All Over - 4.5/5Overall:51.5/604 StarsJin really brought the heat with this album. This album isn't no pop/rap like his debut, it's straight up hip hop. Jin lyrically kills every track and Golden Childs production is amazing. Definitely check out this certified banger!"
3,"3.5.. Lacks bass.. lacks the delivery, and the eccentricity of debut.","While this album is more mature, FAR more focused.. and a bit more cohesive.. this album isn't as fun.. isn't as pulsating, and isn't as ultimately pleasurable as the debut. It's interesting how far opposed the two Jin albums are to eachother..this is a great album, it is EXTREMELY cohesive, so you will enjoy the entire duration..Highlights include ProperGanda, and the banging No Concept."
2,wish I'd seen this before I got mine,I got the silver model and found the same problem. I guess the lesson is to check for ratings on the other colors of a product you're considering!
1,You call this a cookbook?,"Whole Foods makes so many great fresh foods that people will still go to the store for even if you put it in a cookbook. I would love the recipe for the Lemon White Chocolate Coconut cookies, Oatmeal Cookies and their delicious Turkey Lime salad. You need a better cookbook then this."
2,Riddled with typos,"This is a beautiful cookbook, with a few very good recipes--Fragrant Ginger Lime Chicken Fingers and Southwest King Ranch Casserole among them. Unfortunately, these are far outnumbered by the recipes that simply do not work, especially those involving the delicate manufacture of dough. At first I thought I had it wrong, but over the course of repeated failures, I realized that the problem was in the testing and/or proofreading. And it's not just dry measures; the text of one recipe calls for onions, when it means potatoes. Several re-readings later, I finally cracked the code. I sincerely hope that the authors try again to get it right. The tragedy is how close they came..."
2,I really wanted to like this cookbook....,"...but I have to agree with the other reviewers who said that the recipes fall short. Many of them sound absolutely delicious, but I have found many errors and in recipes where there are no obvious errors, I often have to make adjustments to the seasonings or ingredients (for example, I made the Lemon Tahini Sauce tonight to go with the baked Falafel Balls...the falafel balls recipes is missing a step, and the lemon tahini sauce calls for way, way too much tahini and the end product is not what the recipe describes. I could fix both mistakes, but I shouldn't have to). I wish they would do some heavy revising to this cookbook, because it has so much promise."
1,Yikes! Errors Galore!,"This is an amazing cookbook but for the 100 or so needed corrections that Whole Foods has listed on its website. I could read this book for hours, it really has some delicious and creative healthful recipes. Unfortunately, I've learned not to go beyond READING it, as I've wasted grocery cash and time finding out that the proof (reading) was not in the ""putting"" for Whole Foods editorial staff! Wait till the much-needed revised edition comes out!"
4,Please be fair,"Ok, ok... so the cookbook might not be perfect. Everything I've tried in here has been fantastic. I also read a pretty negative review about the errors contained in the book. First off, most errors are in nutritional information, yet not in anything as important as caloric intake or fat content. They are minor glitches, nothing that most people would even read. Second, the errors in the recipes number about FIVE. That's it. I went through and made changes in my cookbook and was finished in about 3 minutes. Please, please... be fair already. It's a great cookbook with some fantastic recipes. You can go online and make the necessary changes to the ingredients as needed. There aren't many."
3,Great ideas from this cookbook,"The Whole Foods market Cookbook is excellent. It arrived damaged however and could not be given as a gift, which I intended."
2,Huge let down,"Whole Foods recipes are not as healthy as they prescribe, nor that tasty. We have tried several recipes from this book with hopes that we would find something that would satisfy us. We never found any."
2,"Big hat, no cattle","I must agree with the other reviewers who desperately tried to like this cookbook. The recipe titles sound delicious, Whole Foods sells beautiful ingredients, but put the two together and it's neither beautiful nor delicious. There are errors in ingredients, measurements, cooking times and, most importantly, judgement. Some of these dishes should have gone straight to the trash. Maybe now that Whole Foods has purchased Wild Oats, they'll incorporate some of the recipes from Wild Oats' website into a revised edition of this book. It needs them."
4,found recipes I've been looking for!,"We moved from a city in NC that had a Whole Foods Market (which used to be called Wellspring) to one in which there was none (Indianapolis). There were so many salads that I loved from Whole Foods that I had adapted into my own recipes that I thought I could get by without having the store nearby. When I lost my version of ""smoked mozzarella pasta salad,"" I went to the Internet to see if I could find an approximation. Imagine my delight when I stumbled across this cookbook. Even better, the recipe in the book for smoked moz pasta salad was better than mine. I was so happy with it that I bought another cookbook for my Mom. She is also thrilled. There are many, many great recipes. If you are one who needs to have color pictures, this is not the book for you. I would rate the cooking skill needed for this book to be a novice+. However, you have to appreciate how important it is to have the freshest and best ingredients possible."
4,Good Cookbook!,"I checked this book out from the library and after making a number of recipes I have decided to buy it. The information the book gives about individual ingredients is very helpful, and I like the Whole Foods attitude toward food. So far I have not discovered mistakes, as other reviewers have noted (which is not to say they aren't there), and have found the recipes easy to follow."
1,Disappointed,I've been playing the Triple Play series for years on Playstation 1 and frankly this X-box game is not near the fun that those games were and still are. The major thing is that it is too easy. I hate the batting directional and wish I could take it off. The old games would take me some time to get through the individual levels but this one I moved straight into the Pro Level and I'm like 10-1. (Had too much wine on the loss). Most of the games are blow outs. I'm practicing on the highest level but I think I've got the level figured out for the season.I've had the game just a couple of weeks and I'm kicking the games tail. This was not the way the old games were. You had to work and practice to get better. I find myself bored with the game and then go back to play Madden football.
1,Disappointing to say the least - A Lazy Effort by EA,"* Can't customize within the levels of gameplay. This was a feature back in 1995 - gone.* Instant replay - can't change angles, no slow motion - gone.* Batter view / camera angles - gone.* Fielding - Players look like little stick people - zoomed out too much.* Players look like bobble-head dolls.* Menu system is horrible and slow.* Bob Costas and Chris Rock? - Dat wuz a sweeeeeeet play Bob!* Back-to-back-to-back-to-back homers on Pro level. Hmmmm* Players don't throw the ball on the run anymore - gone.EA could have done so much more with the very capable X-Box. Looked like a lazy effort. I've never played anyone else's baseball games (except the old Nintendo Baseball - remember with Babe Ruth and all those guys (that was fun!)), so I can only compare to previous versions of the game. The programmers should take some lessons from their NHL crew. Disappointed."
1,this game is worse than games i bought in 1996,"This is by FAR the worst baseball game I've played in a long while and I usually buy 2 or 3 a year and rent the others. The graphics look awful in this game, and the gameplay was ridiculous. The way the pitch slows down at the end and the awkward batting circle/target. this game disappointed EXTREMELY. i saw one pitch and put the controller down. it was that bad. Luckily, I bought All Star Baseball which while not great, much better than this game. I can't understand how Luis Gonzalez put his name on this game. It was just awful."
2,Disappointing,"This game has a nice set-up, and had the potential to be a good baseball sim. Costas' play by play and the little cut scenes before you get up to bat really give you the feel of a baseball game. However once you come up to bat, the game doesn't deliver. I think I had 30 homers the first game that I played, and it got less and less challenging after that. I recommend that you avoid this game unless you like home-run derby's."
3,Lets hurry up! The season is starting!,That is exactly what EA did with this game. It was definately hurried. EA left themselves an extremely low baseline to improve upon. I expect a better effort next time. If you love baseball you will still enjoy this game.
1,EA Sports will dissapoint again,"From what i hear, this game will be for the non-baseball fan. Do any of you remember TP 99? The game was based on timing and deception not some box in the middle of the screen. I will rent this but i am telling you, i wasted my money last year on this. In real baseball, you can't see where the pitcher is going to throw it. The graphics are the only upside on the game. If anyone knows if EA will make that pitching aid optional, tell me"
2,slow reading history book,I found this history book a very slow read. It contains too little detail about USA's actual fighting in WW I and too much detail about other background information. It uses too many quotations to flesh out various points raised in the various chapters. The book could have been half as long and still get the major points across.
5,Nice Tool,"I'm doing a lot of transplanting of zoysia plugs from the back yard to the front. I have found this transplanter to work fine for that task. It is larger than any hand shovel I previously owned. But it really comes in handy when I need to dig deep in the ground. It is sturdy, well built. I would recommend it."
3,"Fast read, fast ending","This is what my sister and I call fillers. I like Wallace's books, and I own several, but she wraps up her endings too fast. It seems like she wanted to hurry up and finish this book. I also found an error! She referred to Kelly when she should have said Melissa. But read it anyways, it will only take one day."
1,too disposable,"Hmmmm, what can I say. It works okay when its new but there are just too many problem components. Things wear out too fast and need regular replacement. The money you save on the original purchase price is sucked out of your pocket on upkeep. Opening the container to add paint is a nightmare. The composite plunger portion of the pump breaks way too easily and you have to buy the whole cartridge to get a new one. I broke the ceramic tip once and, same thing, had to buy the whole replacement cartridge to get a new one. Hey Wagner, I wouldn't mind paying an extra $50-$75 for a better product. How about that?"
4,July 4th BBQ!,Interesting Mix. So far with a mango jerk glaze I used to marinate the chicken night before and cooked using a smoke box on coal tasted great. Defiantly changed the flavor of the meats for the better. Just wish price was better.
3,"Not bad, but not superb",Used these last night with chicken drumsticks. The flavor was a bit too mild for my taste. Price point is good though as they do go a long way.
2,Great topic but weak character development,"I was attracted to this book because the topic is seldom addressed in children's literature. However, I found the story to be under developed. When characters are challenged, they underreact. They almost seem to step out of the story, treat the situation frivously and move on. The dialogue does not always ring true. Needs a good editor to give it some umph! Lots of potential but it does not deliver."
4,"A terrific book, but not quite as good as the first one.","I liked this book a lot because it was very believable. I admire most of the characters, especially Janie, because they are very good examples, but they're not perfect. My favorite part was the trial before the Council and I think that particular scene was the most thrilling scene in the whole book, although nothing too gruesome or sensational happened. I loved the ending, although I cannot give any reasons why because they would give it away. However, it does a lot of explaining in the text, and I was a bit disappointed about that, because in the first book most of the explaining was in the dialogue. I appreciate this style more because it makes everything clear without boring the reader at all. Not that I think the sequel was boring! It is definitely one of my favorite books, but nonetheless, I like Night of the Solstice better than its successor."
3,Valor,This title sounds passionate and dramatic. The whole teen romance thing is a bit tawdry nowadays and I think that this is what makes it more interesting. There is actually a boy/girl story in the plot and this makes the book more realistic as far as relating to real life people!
3,Good Orchestral and Choral Music,"The reason I purchased this CD was because it contained one of my favorite Orchestral and Choral works titled ""These Things Shall Be."" I first heard this great work some 46 years ago when it was performed by my high school orchestra and choir. I must confess that I was spoiled by the outstanding performance by my high school's orchestra and choir. I thought the high school performance and arrangement of ""These Things Shall Be"" was far superior. Thus, I was disappointed when I heard the arrangment by conductor John Ireland. The remaining songs on the CD were average in terms of quality and inspiration. Finding this particular recorded song is not easy. I thought the CD was a little overpriced given that, in my opinion, the performances were average."
2,Don't judge this CD by its cover,"I feel cheated. Seeing a current photo of Bryn Terfel conveyed to me that he was a primary vocalist on this CD. Although the music is enjoyable, I really expected to hear him. If he's heard on this CD, I've missed him. My error confirms the old adage modified to ""you can't judge a CD by its cover!!"""
3,Not what I expected....,I bought it for the pilates and cardio workout. I have the exact pilate routine on another dvd and didn't like the cardio workout they had.
3,cd could definitely be improved upon,"The book itself is alright, although for my 3 1/2 year old daughter, I think that the pages may be a bit too simple. The cd, however, is the same reading over and over. My daughter listened to it constantly when we first purchased the book, and it become incredibly annoying. I actually put the book up for a while, just so I wouldn't have to hear it again."
3,Quaint but Slow,"Having little acquaintance with Mexican horror films, I was curious to try one of the more highly-regarded ones to see what it was like. Certainly it is a well-produced movie, especially by current-day direct-to-video horror standards. The lighting and sets of the hacienda are marvelously atmospheric, and a number of the supporting players are quite capable character actors. Unfortunately, German Robles is not that effective as the vampire count. He seems more stiff than courtly, and in the climactic fight scene he looks like a kid who's ready to burst into tears. The pacing is also sedate almost to the point of somnolence. El Vampiro will have some value to genre buffs but is not truly a very outstanding movie."
2,Paint eater works on old dry paint only,"The disk is made out of plastic, not metal. it wears down fast and clogs the head unless the paint is very old and already flaking. I'm waiting for someone to come out with a generic disk that is made of metal or an abrasive sandpaper."
3,Audio quality leaves a lot to be desired,"This is a nice-looking little recorder, and it is certainly cheaper than the $150 Sony ICDST10, but the audio, while generally OK for dictation, is, in my opinion, just not good enough for recording meetings or lectures. The ICDP17's audio quality is approximately the same as the Sony ICDST10 in ""LP"" mode. The difference between this unit and the Sony ICDST10 is that the ICDST10 will record around two hours of VERY good audio (in ""SP"" mode, using Sony's LPEC Codec), or a bit over five and a half hours in ""LP"" mode (compared to a little over four and a half hours for the ICDP17). The Sony ICDMS515 has even better sound quality (and with Memory Sticks available up to 256MB, can record hours and hours of audio), but at $250 (not counting the extra you'll spend to upgrade the woefully inadequate 8MB Memory Stick Sony includes), this is way out of the ICDP17's price range. In my opinion, $150 for the Sony ICDST10 is a much better deal than $99 for the ICDP17."
1,Totally Inadequate for Lectures,"If you are looking for a DVR for recording lectures, don't waste your money on this piece of sh**! The sound quality is very poor compaired to the LPEC units and the record volume is extremely low. It is unfortunate that a good company like Sony would release such a poor quality product and advertise it as being useful for lecture recording."
5,If you like anti flag youll love this,This new band straight out of the heart of pittsburgh is one of the best new bands around. With there brand new debut cd just out they cant go wrong. This is a very enerjetic political band along the same lines as anti-flag and the unseen. Very talented and put there heart into the music. I reccomend this cd highly so go out and get it today.
5,Terrific!,"It's the only Mexican cookbook I brought back with me to Mexico. The texts lively and thoughtful - as complex and as entertaining as a Mexican market itself. - Ron Mader, El Planeta Platica journal"
5,Dick & Jane,I purchased this book for a Project Linus book and blanket challenge we had in Maine. Our Project Linus Piscatiquis County Coordinator does one of these challenges every two years. It is great to see what project people select. You make a quilt to match your book you selected.
1,"Don't Waste Your Children's Time, there are so many other choices nowadays","When I first had these readers assigned to me in 1953 they were the most boring books I ever read or have read thereafter. ""Mother"" stays home and wears dresses. ""Father' goes to work. In 1953 I don't remember many families like that, and for sure today's children are not being reared in that style. I cannot imagine how awful and strange these books must seem to children who now have instant information accessible to them via computers and the Internet. To compare then and now, nowadays children are often (not all school districts) expected to be able to read before they start kindergarten. Back then, when we started kindergarten we were taught to count from one to ten and learn ""to say our ABC's"". I was very disappointed to see these books are still around! Go, Go, Go, Run, Run, Run, Vomit, Vomit, Vomit! And to all of you who also gave them one star, Clap, Clap, Clap! You are wise people."
5,So glad I found these!,I would recommend this to anyone with a child/grandchild who is just starting to read!I loved them when I was growing up and I was so thrilled to be able to find these books for my granddaughter to read!It gives us something in common in this big old modern world that is flying past us so fast.
5,Fantastic and worth paying a bit more!,"I've tried so many moisturizers/wrinkle minimizers from the stores, but none really worked well for me. Most left me with no improvement, irritated skin, irritated eyes (from vapors?) and simply frustrated. Some moisturizers would leave my face looking shiny/oily, and would even make my mascara run. This stuff works very well for me. I'm 50 something, and it really does help soften those fine lines. I use it around my eyes and around my mouth and I think it helps delay getting new wrinkles/laugh lines. To me, it is worth paying more than I normally would. A little bit goes a long way, so this should last me months. I use just a tiny bit. It feels like a very watery gel when I put it on, but it soaks in in just a few minutes and is good all day. If you want to try a sample, check out the trurenu website for their sample packs. You can try several small samples of different products to see if things work for you, and it only costs a few dollars."
3,Where Dreams Are Born,"An early insight into what Ms Monheit was to become. This CD, filled with standards and done in stylish and smooth scoring is a preview of the jazz stylist Monheit is now. It won't interrupt your conversation if its playing in the background and makes for perfect coffee-house background music. Give it a try and then go out and buy In The Sun or Taking a Chance On Love, you won't be sorry."
4,Understated beauty,"I bought these as a Christmas present for my wife years ago when I was on an even more stringent budget than I am now. I did a lot of comparison shopping, and these are certainly a great value for the size, cut, clarity and color of the diamonds. She still loves these now and was thrilled I was able to afford a pair of real diamond earrings during those days. A few things to consider:1. They are relatively small. These are not huge, splashy stones, but pretty and understated. This is for someone who values quality over quantity.2. I have not seen any of the durability or looseness problems stated in other reviews. My wife has worn them on a fairly regular basis over the years and have not had any issues.3. If you're a novice diamond buyer like I was, make sure to read up on the 4 C's of diamonds: Cut, Color, Clarity and Carat."
2,nice but easy to loose,"I got them for Our anniversary. I love them because they are small and cute, but I am almost afraid to wear them because the stud is too thin and the stopper is too big."
5,Great Christmas gift,"The earrings I bought from Amazon were absolutely great! They arrived about a week before Christmas and, with some clever wrapping, my fiance was extremely pleased. I highly recommend them!"
2,Too small,and very cheap looking and diamond were not that clear. I was disappointed and had to return the item. i would not suggest this.
2,NOT WORTH IT!!,These earrings were a dissapointment. They were very dull and so tiny that for the price it's not worth it at all.
4,Works great on my Mac.,"Sure it's no PS2 controller, but all the buttons work fine and I have no problems at all with the D-pad. Some say they can only go diagonally, but I have no problems going straight. Maybe I'm just really skilled. So if you're really skilled too, then this controller is your ticket, cheap and good."
1,Gamepad Pro K-42111,"It's setup is perfect because of the similarity to the Play Station controller. On the other hand, it is lacking in quality. It pooped out on me after about a month or two of usage. I will give Gravis some room, it may be an isolated incident and I intent to try their newer model in hopes that it is put together better."
2,start to ?,"At first, this gamepad was pretty good. The USB connection was too easy. If your a hardcore gamer, skip it, because after some ware, it shows it's true colors. The buttons started malfunctioning within about 4 weeks of use."
3,A decent starting pad for emu-gamers.,"Among emulation gamers this is a common gamepad. Its a mix between the SNES and Playstation pads (the one before they went analog). You have the 4 candy colored buttons like the japanese Super Famicom pad (US Snes pads just had grey buttons), Start and Select (exactly where they should be), and 4 shoulder buttons; 2 of those would be L and R, the other two I'd map to the Save State / Load State function on ZSNES.I can't say I care for the D-pad though, its bumpy and has a screwhole? Nothing like the tried and true ""cross"" of my yesterdays. Its a fair pad for just ZSNES, but if you wanna do other stuff, get a Lik-Sang adapter, download Joy2Key and dig any standard or aftermarket PS1/PS2 pad out of your closet. You can map keys to buttons and mouse to analog sticks. Works even with the PC games that normally were Keyboard/Mouse only."
3,"Great, but has its problems.","The fact that this controller is cheap, USB Plug and Play ready, and so similar to the playstation controller is the reason it's a solid bet.However here are the problems:1. The directional pad is innacurate on precision. If you just need to walk around in a game its great, but if you need to hit a specific direction, it will come off usually as a diagonal.2. The buttons are very loud and get stuck. The Green button doesn't pop out most of the time anymore. It seems like a small problem, but it can get very frustrating.This is a good buy, but not your best choice. If you need a quick, cheap way to not having to use your keyboard, it's well worth your money."
2,"Quality is terrible, breaks in a year.",the first time i bought this controller it was great since it looks like the ps controller after a year or so the controller just stops functioning. Bought another same controller and it just stops functioning after a year again. This controller i dont recommend buying this controller. The Logitech gamepad works better.
2,The diagonal D pad strikes again!,"I originally bought this gamepad because it's basically a clone of a playstation controller, and I had an old Gravis 4 button gamepad from 1995 that suited me well and I hope its quality would carry over to this product. Simply put the directional control on the gamepad pro is not very consistant and gamer friendly. This might be a great game pad if you must make lots of diagonal moves like if your playing Q*Bert, but if your game depends on many crisply executed non-diagonal moves, like the NES game the Legend of Zelda, forget about this pad! The pad has a hair trigger when it comes to diagonals.This is the second crappy pc joystick a purchased. Come on PC Peripheral makers, start making better joysticks!! The console manufacturers do far better in quality, precision and durability when it comes to their controls. The reason being, if the controls that come with the system are lousy people will instantly hate that system."
3,you get what you pay for...,"i bought this item at best buy ($12) for use with my NES emulator on my laptop. on the plus side, winXP recognizes this thing right away and you're good to go. however, like a lot of other users, i found the D pad to be a problem. i screwed in the ""joystick"" thingie and didn't find it made any difference. when i would hold it up or down, it would move in different (diagonal) directions. there were certain moves/functions i could not do in my NES games because of this. so yeah, it's usuable, if you don't need to hold it up or down for more than 1/2 a second. not bad for the price, but if you want full functionality, spend a few more bucks and get something better."
2,One very annoying flaw: the D-Pad!,"Response is okay - if a bit slow - but the directional pad is not very stable at all (very noticable in puzzle games like Tetris or Dr. Mario, even brought up problems in some platform games) and so control is shaky. I will be returning mine shortly in order to try out something different, this is just aggravating me."
3,"It's response is better than earlier models, but not perfect","I noticed that I didn't get as quick a response from this controller as I get from a Playstation controller. This often has to do with the type of connection you have with your disk drive, but I wish it could just be a little more sturdy with its response. I play NHL 2001 with this controller, and often I need to make a move in order to get around a defender, but with this controller I move a little too late and end up flat on my face taking an ice bath. It feels a little bit cheap in your hand, but it is very sturdy, and I would know because I am a tosser, a gamer with a short temper. Buy this if you want a no-nonsense controller that is easy to set up, just don't expect as perfect a response as a gaming console controller."
4,With the New Xperience Software this Controller Rocks!,"I own two of these now, and I must say that its a decent controller. The new software on gravis.com has support for Keyboard emulation so you can use these things for ANY game.The USB set-up is very easy to use, and the controllers have lasted me long over a year.As a laptop user I was thrilled with USB gamepads after having a 3 year drought, and trying the tepid Gravis Stinger.Buy this one! Its one of Gravis' Finest!"
2,"Victorians, Mansion, Lust: Let the Sex Begin!","This is pretty good for what it is: erotic literature with no pretensions. It is set in Victorian times, but there's actually no way to know when it was written. The language sometimes seems quite modern. It's full of detailed descriptions of sex (regular, oral and anal) beween men and women, between women and women, among the gentry, between the gentry and their servants and between servants and servants. Not a bad thing overall, but don't expect great literature."
2,accurate then crappy,"This gun i had actually a while ago baught it for my friends birthday which was pretty cool. When we first go the gun it was awsome and really accurate at almost 20 yards but the next day we went out to shoot it after 10 minutes it just started to break down into pieces. Like at first the o-ring behind the pump popped off so then the whole pump just came apart and since the o-ring BROKE off we could not put it back together. So I dont recomend this but like for other people though it just worked out perfect for them so, your choice i mean it is cheap so your not going to hate your self for the rest of your life of course."
5,GET READY TO KICK SOME &#%,"This game is off da hook!!The graphics are jaw dropping,and the girls are easy on the eyes.This games got some awesome combos,and a special combo for each character called a beast drive.With tons of different modes to unlock this game will keep you playing for hours.It also has four different characters to unlock, and with two player mode(Versus mode)you and your friends can battle it out. This game is a must have for the GAMECUBE!"
3,De Ja Vu?,"Okay, first of all, this is an awesome game. However, if you played Bloody Roar 3 (on the PS2) too much, then this game will have horribly low replay factor. You'll play it non-stop for maybe a day, and never play it again. It's basically a remake of BR3, except with a few new additions: new characters, and cheats! (which can all be unlocked very quickly) Other than that, it is BR3. If you haven't played BR3 much or at all, then buy this game and play it for weeks, maybe even months. (maybe) Do be wawrned: it has a relatively low replay factor. Everything is too easy to unlock. If you own or played BR3 too much, rent this game, but do not buy it. Buy VF4 (if you have PS2) But, overall, this is a great game, but unfortunately the moves are all the same: everything is the same. But, still, a good game."
4,Coolz,"that was one of the coolest games i rented, i too rented it and became hooked. when ya transform there is also this electricity effects foying around, i'd say it's a must buy game."
4,One Stupid Thing...,"The girls' bodies. (characters: alice, shina, and jenny) Their breasts are unreasonably too large! They shakes when you select the characters. (yeah, yeah, guys, stop hooting) They're like barbies and it bothers me. Otherwise, it's great- even better than mortal kombat and tekken.... Few days ago, I brought Gamecube. Bloody Roar: Primal Fury is my first game. I'm really glad I brought the right game for the first time. Next game I'm gonna buy... hmm...Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. ^.^"
4,"""Bloody Roar: Primal Fury"" For GC","""Bloody Roar: Primal Fury"" For the Gamecube is a large leap for the series. This game's most spectacular and addicting, (Or the very thing that makes it tacky and stupid) is it's theme. If you like the thought of humans fighting with an alter ego animal side, along with a japanese flair, then you'll love it. For me, it's very refreshing in comparison to overly serious games like ""Tekken 4"" or ""Soul Calibur 2"". And it has a lot more meaning than ""Super Smash Brother's Melee"". It's expansively superior in it's noble yet somewhat innocent theme. If you don't like the theme, than I extremely advise you not to get this game or any one of it's incarnations because they're all the same in that way."
5,Bloody roar kicked ass ( excuse my french),"I thought it was a kick [rear] game, and the other fightin gamesdont even measure up to this beast morphing 2 player game.The guy that I like the most is the mole, I call him the molebecause I cant pernounce his [dang] name.(and I like the tiger guy)Oh yeah I am going to buy this sick [rear] game on friday the 5th.But its not at your store. sorry:) well peace easy."
2,A little too Tekken,"This game is just a little bit too much like Tekken. I am a Mortal Kombat fan, a game which I believe takes skill. ... This game seems to be a button tapping game, but it is the only fighting game on Gamecube so far. Get Spiderman, Tony Hawk 3, PIKMIN!!!..., or rent some other games, before buying this one. I love a good fighting game, and in my opinion, this is just not one of those!Later"
4,Awesome,"This is one of the best games that I have ever played, it has Cronos the Phenix and Ganesha the Elephant as playable characters! Awesome!"
3,"Short, Even for a Fighting Game","The battles are so short in this game, and the story mode is so short, I had all the extra characters and such after just a few days. There are much better games out there, Virtua Fighter 4 and DOA3 are prime examples of good fighting games."
2,Same Old Same Old,"This is just another mediocre fighting game... fairly mediocre graphics, same old kicks and punches... oo turning into animals? thats new... but poorly done... trust me, if your into arcade style fighting games give Soul Calibur II a spin, or if your just into fighting games period get Super Smash Bro. Melee."
3,Anyone noticed no game here has a rating less than 4?,"I liked this game enough. I will not down play the fact that it is as of now the best fighter on the Gamecube (that I have played). But as fighters go, it lacks a little somehting...Intuitive controls.And this is not to say that Bloody Roar controlls poorly either. Instead, Bloody Roar controls fine once you have forced yourself to get used to the controls. One of the largest complaint? Not being able to side step without a button. Any Soul Caliber players will know that you could seemlessly move about the ring without any troubles. Bloody Roar forces you into a more 2-D game, as side stepping almost takes to much time.Graphics: greatSound: Darn goodStroyline: A little weakControls: Just bad enought to be annoying.Fun: Just enough to be worth picking up."
3,Cable does better,"The scenery selections were great. Beautiful shorelines, cliffs, etc. Don't expect to see 'full nudity' as the title sugests. Most scnes were shown from the side and/or rear. The cliffs and ocean scenes were a much better view."
2,nude beaches of california,"I found this dvd to be very interesting but not worth bragging about, the beaches were ok but only one girl at it each beach. come on mate surely there are more nudists in California"
2,Good Beach Footage,"It's a good video for views of the beaches and how to find them. But the models? Gah! Bunch of white skinned hipster chicks who've never been exposed to the sun. Plenty of real nudists would have done this film, and there should be more diversity: couples, males, different races and body types. The footage of Red Rock was especially disappointing, and shot at high tide in the winter with the sand all gone. During warmer months, it's full of sand, and a lot more beach at low tide. Also, they don't mention the serious frisbee players as soon as the tide goes out. In other words, duck!No footage of Bonny Doon, Panther, San Gregorio beaches? Bit of a rip off."
3,Not impressed,"Good description of beaches, but I wouldn't waste 45 min watching it. Still pictures would have been just as good."
5,Nude Beaches of California,"Visit the best nude beaches in California including the beautiful Kirby Cove, the wild untamed Redrock Beach, the hidden cove of Muir Beach, the magical black Sand Beach, the spectacular Kirby Cove, and San Francisco's own Baker Beach. Learn the secrets and locations of hideaway clothing optional beaches, with rare footage of uncrowded sandy shores, and gorgeous bare bodies worshipping the sun. Includes maps, directions, and actual location footage shot in high definition digital wide screen format. COMMENT: The only comment I have about this DVD is that the models are not beautiful enough."
1,I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK,I did not purchase this book. Please remove it from my account. someone used my card to purchase this. I have already spoken to YOU REGARDING THIS PROBLEM.
1,sucks,WTF this video is just close up one a naked girl who not a model she just a ok looking girl and there no other girls and they talk about the nudist beach but u learn nothing . I want my money back .
1,This is a poorly performed and misedited recording.,"January 29, 1999 Review: French Favorites: Chandos7031 A truly unfortunate collaboration between conductor and engineers, this is an extremely heavy-handed treatment of light orchestra work. The intentions of Mr. Järvi are at best unclear, and at worst, as in the Milhaud Suite Provenal, utterly inappropriate. The Milhaud is a light and playful work here performed without delicacy or any sense of the folk origins of the tunes first set down by André Campra. The editing, by one Jonathan Cooper, further exacerbates the leaden effect. The saccharin notes by Edward Blakeman and Michael Fleming neither help nor enlighten. There are so many recordings of the other works on this disc that one can find better performances without effort, but the Suite Provenal is not widely available, and it is a shame that it is so poorly presented here."
1,FREEKSTUPID,"This game is so boring.Nothing is real,no real tracks.....I would recommened MX SUPERFLY its so real and way better than this game.So dont waist your $$$$${money}."
5,This Game Freekin' Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"finally, a motocross game that is fast and fun! it feels like you are going 200 mph! i've played all of the others and they were slow and ugly expecially the carmichael mx games. the graphics are rad, probably the best i've seen on my ps2. freeksytle was a blast from the start. the characters were funny - deegan rulez and leeann is hot!go out and get your own copy or you will miss out on the best moto racing game ever!"
2,Neither erotic nor horror,I am not a fan of Jess Franco and Mansion of the living dead is the second of his movies I have seen. The movie has some innovative ideas when combining horror and erotism but it does not deliver either. It was a disappointing experience for me.
4,"Great Men-u Product ,short on packaging","Like all other Men-u products,this shower gel is way above average.Very concentrated so although pricey,it is reasonable per application. However is is not packaged in the usual Men-u travel container with the lockable pump. It comes in a squeezable soft toothpaste type container. For that reason it gets 4 stars instead of five. But a solution that works well is to use an empty Men-u travel container that may have been for shampoo or conditioner. Re-label it with permanent marker and you are good to go,the gel flows just fine through the pump. Don't know why Men-u doesn't deal with this shortcoming in packaging.Setting aside the packaging issue ,it is a very good body wash gel,highly recommend it."
1,Amazon should not duplicate reviews.,"All the reviews here are for a version by Gunther Wand, not Furtwangler. Who conducted the recording being sold under Furtwangler's name on MP3, Wand or Furtwangler?"
1,Gimmicky finale,"At best, a rather pedestrian reading of the 9th. Yoav Talmi is no Celibidache and the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra no Vienna Philharmonic. I bought it for the orchestrated finale, but was sorely disappointed. Give this disk a miss."
1,Hated This!,"I can't believe this is Mariah Stewart. I have loved ALL her books and this was totally ridiculous. First she finds her husband with another woman, won't listen to him, then all of a sudden at the end of the book she does and all is well in one second. Stupid, stupid, stupid storyline. Maggie and JD are being interviewed on television and the interviewers questions are so silly, there's no way that would really happen. I couldn't finish this piece of crap. I hope she doesn't ever write a book this bad again."
1,Boring!,"This game is extremely boring. Nothing better than a rental for a day or two.It's not worth buying even at the ... price. The crashes are OK, but still pretty ....The graphics are fair, not breath taking. The highlight of the game was... well none really."
1,Fast and Furious!,"This is a bad game!It is way too easy too crash, and you explode into a thousand pieces when you do...I recommend Burnout or Burnout2 over this game."
4,a good childrens book to reveiw,(...)in english we have to chose a childrens book to reasearch and i picked way home i would like to say it is a fantastic book and has great illerstations we also had to research the author and i found she was a very nice person to research on some web sites it says the reading level is for 4-8 year old well i disagree i would have to say i enjoyed it (...)
4,Una gran compilacion de buenas bandas y buenas canciones.,"Este es un buen disco de las canciones que escuchaban nuestros tios, pero con una vibra diferente y recompuesta. Verdaderamente una buena infusion de elementos para aquel que gusta del buen rock mexicano. Maldita y Molotov, me parece, hacen el mejor 'tributto'."
1,way too strong,"This product may smell good at first, but it is much too strong. It has left my family and myself unable to breathe. We have been coughing continually and have had burning eyes and thoat. It is so irritating that I cannot be in the carpeted rooms but a minute before having to leave. We have repeatedly tried to vacuum the scent out to get rid of it without success. Our next step is to try to shampoo it out of the carpet. This is the worst product that I have ever used. It has been days since I have been able to sit in one of our carpeted rooms. If you are even mildly irritated by strong smells, stay clear of this product- it's awful."
5,great for students,I used this for a workshop with fourth graders and this book is extremely helpful. Great examples and how tos. Also wonderful examples of Haikus to get you going.
3,Too soon to tell,I used this on the interior upholstery of my car so its too soon to tell if it works or not. Certainly easy to apply. Be advised that this product MUST be stored inside. It only tolerates storage temps between 30 and 90 degrees.
5,303 High Tech Fabric Guard,Very happy with the results. It does take a few coats. I used it on an old Saab convertible top.
2,Not great,"No matter how carefully I wiped with a soft cloth, sprayed directly, or on the cloth, it dried smeary. I don't like it."
5,The Best,I was introduced to this product a fews years back by a boat dealer and haven't used anything else since. It is not greasy like a lot of other products on the market and looks more like a new finish than anything I have found. I use it on my car's interior as well as the exterior. I also own a canoe that I use it on to protect it from the sun. Finally a product that works as good as it says it does!I would recommend this product.
5,303 is awesome!,"303 Aerospace Protectant is one of the best products you can buy to protect and shine up your car! Ever since I could drive, I've boycotted ArmorAll for its slimy feel and attraction of dust. 303 shines up your interor and doesn't leave the slimy feel and it doesn't attract dust. When your dash does get dusty, though, you use a dry microfiber towel and wipe off and the shine will stay on. I have yet to use this on my tires, but I'm told it does wonders there, too. I highly recommend this if you want to make your car look new!"
3,"Meh. It works, but way too expensive!","Good Product. It cleans and products. The shine/coating seems to last longer than other brands I have tried, but I don't think it justifies the price. I would definitely recommend if it was about half the price."
3,Aerospace 303 protectant very good but too pricey,"Aerospace 303 protectant very good but too pricey. I purchased for use on a hot tub cover. i must admit, it appears to do a great job at restoring and protecting. I just found the gallon jug at over $60 to be very expensive. I feel that i could have gotten similar results from a gallon of armor all for half the price. I probably won't buy again but that decision is purely based on cost. If i could find for $30-40 bucks then i would probably buy again."
3,not worth 15 bux,Works very well on tires as they stay deep black(although not shiny) for months. I have however used this product on my car vinyl in the fall and now the spring and it only lasts about 5 days before it starts to dry out. I does look nice but doesn't penetrate into my vinyl like other protectants I've used. It kind of just sits on top and wipes away way too easily if touched. Maybe my honda civic's 03 vinyl just isn't compatible with this stuff because everyone else seems to love it. I will be looking for a different product next time.
5,Overall protection,"Better alternative to Armourall. Cleans and protects without an oily film, doesn't seem to attract dust and grim. Best product for its purpose. Price is right even with shipping."
5,Best all around protectant,"I've used numerous products on my Corvette and most of them are acceptable, I was recommended Aerospace 303 protectant because my windshield cowl was looking its age at 13 years old. I tracked down this product at a truck specialty shop and haven't looked back since. The cowl is now very black and it pretty much looks new. I treated all my weatherstripping and the engine hoses as well. The interior looks very clean after using this product and it doesn't leave anything feeling greasy either. I will continue to use aerospace 303 and continue to recommend it as long as its available."
5,great for outgassing issues,"This stuff is very good for the dash. I used it to control outgassing of my dashboard plastic and it cured the problem. It also makes it look great, not greasy at all. It seems to block the UV and hopefully prevent aging. I apply about every month."
3,Ok to use,"This was ok to use on my convertible top, but used up almost all 16oz. It does seem to repel water well, but next time I'll try something else - possibly RaggTop, to see if it is any better. The way 303 protectant goes on is strange, sudses up llike soap so you can't just spread it where it needs to go. Very expensive as far as cleaners and protectants go, paid $15 for a 16oz bottle."
5,303 Aerospace Protectant,"I've used this product for several years on my car; i.e., all the rubber gaskets, the dash, and the windshield wiper blades. It does a great job of protecting the dash, which is as good as new after several years of exposure to the sun. Has a low sheen and isn't overly oily as some other products. I order this product online because I cannot find a local merchant who carries it."
5,Love this stuff!!!!,I own two Honda Elements...a 2004 and 2005. After bringing the '05 home from the dealer I realized how bad the plastic panels on my '04 had already begun to look in less than 16 months. I jumped on the Element Owners boards to find out what to use - and 303 was recommended. I bought some of it and used it on the '04 - it immediately made a HUGE difference. Restored the panels back to new again. I use it now once a month to keep the inside and outside looking great on both Elements. This stuff doesn't dry out the plastic like some products and its got a UV protector. All Element owners should be using this stuff from day one. Don't let your panels fade to brittle white.
4,Works well,"I use 303 Protectant to clean and protect the plastic windows on my boat. It works well, cleaning off the crud and leaving a nice shine that last longer than anything else I have used. Streaks just a little. I would buy this again."
4,303 Protectant,Very excellent product. I use it on my Hottub cover. Very Hsppy that I could get it from Amazon.
5,Seems to a great product,"I have used this product only once to this date (7-2011) but i have to say it is the best product of its kind so far. The finish it leaves is great, it works on all the materials it says it works on, It is very easy to use wipe on wipe off (just like the karate kids)So i do feel safe in saying at this time you should also want this product if you own a RV or boat or a car and truck. I used this on the 39ft RV on the fiber side walls,the rubber seals,the roof gutters,the fan toppers everything but the rubber roof (I use a dicor recommended product to clean and protect the roof from camco Protect) but it is safe for the rubber roof unlike most waxes or polishes."
1,Didn't work for us at all!!,"We chose this to use on our screened gazebo top based on the great reviews. We applied as directed during a drought so it had plenty of time of dry in the sun. The top is 12x12 so we definitely had enough spray to cover the entire top. Today was the first rain we had and there was absolutely no difference, the rain still came through and the table and chairs underneath were soaked. Will not buy again."
3,Highly recommended by my spa manufacturer.,"Thought it was a bit pricey, but it came so highly reocmmened by my spa manufacturer to maintain the cover. Haven't actually used it yet, but will shortly."
5,Best protectant on the market,"I've used this product on everything I own, boat, sled, car, etc. It is the best protectant on the market."
5,Excellent,"Used this pair to clean & waterproof/renew convertible top on a '97 BMW.Once dried, the top shed water as if it hated the stuff!It was as-if I'd used the equivalent of RainX on the fabric.Also, somewhat faded color was renewed (!)--- I actually bought 16oz bottle, but 32oz is way to go for price --"
5,Great product!,Don't want to repeat what everybody says so I'll just say this is a wonderful product for your car. I use it mostly in tires.
4,so far so good,"I ordered this product to coat a fabric ottoman that is not made for outside (polyester fabric though), so it could resist dirt and light moisture (I will cover it or bring inside when not being used). The product was easy to apply, and after a day of drying I sprayed it with a water bottle and the droplets rolled right off. I will test again end of summer to see if the waterproofing lasts."
5,Aerospace Protectant 303,"This is the good stuff-a superior UV protectant for plastic, rubber and fabric. It used to be really hard to find, only a few boat places stocked it. Found on Amazon and bought right away. Fast delivery, good packaging."
5,Repeat purchaser of 303 products,"Excellent product. We have used 303 Fabric Guard in two Travel Trailers now and are extremely pleased with it. New upholstery remained easy to clean, resistant to stains and the colors remained bright."
5,Terrific Protection!,"303 Aerospace Protectorant is the only product I'll use on the bed cover on my 2001 Ford Sport Trac. It not only provides protection from the hot sun in Sacramento, CA, but it also protects the cover in freezing conditions in Lake Tahoe. It also gives it an attractive shine that makes it look new. I will use 303 Aerospace Protectorant for as long as I own my truck."
5,303 is the best for teak furniture,"I just bought my fourth gallon, yes, gallon of 303. And I've received tremendous value from the first three over a lot of years.I've been using 303 lots of places, and I love it. My car, my bicycle, outdoor powder-coated lights, etc.Recently, I discovered how great it is for teak outdoor furniture. I had pretty ratty looking, entirely grey furniture. It now looks amazing. Here's what I do:1) Get some big Scotch-Brite pads and some 409.2) Spray the teak liberally with 409 then go over with the Scotch-Brite3) Rinse with a hose and let dry4) Treat with 303, making sure to wipe dry.5) Repeat every 4 weeks or so. It is really fast to spray and wipe.You'll be stunned how well it works.I'm a big fan of 303, and now have one more reason why."
4,Holy Cow!,"This stuff is amazing,really brought my convertable top to life.It is really messy to use but does a fantastic job."
2,It made my trim get streaks after rain!,"I used this because I saw all these great reviews. I used it on my car's exterior trim, and it rained a few days after. There are now streaks all over the trim that I never had before. I had wiped away all the excess and followed directions too."
1,High Tech Fabric Gaurd,"Got both, cleaner and fabric gaurd. Followed instruction for both cleaner and gaurd, check boat after rain, inside very wet, does not repel water at all. Cover is premium sunbrella material. Don't waste your money. Very disappointed in product afer reading reviews."
2,Not that great,"We had a light rain and most of the protectant washed off my Jeep Wrangler fenders. Aerospace ? Marine ? I don't think that it lived up to the description(see below). It was certainly not worth the price.""This is the maintenance product manufacturers recommend most. Only 303 beautifies as intensely, protects as powerfully or lasts as long. Powerful UV screening protection for colored gel-coat fiberglass, inflatable boats, vinyl, clear vinyl (isinglass) windows, rubber, plastics and leather. Spray on/wipe dry. Treated surfaces repel dirt, soiling, staining, water spots, salt water and mildew. Non-toxic and environmentally safe."""
1,Check order closely,"Check your order closely. This product page will put 303 protectant in your cart, not fabric guard. I was sent the wrong product."
2,Overrated.,"The product is way overrated. For low quality fabrics, it might work. But for the convertible top on BMW, it doesn't do much. The effect worn out very quickly. I should have stick with Autosol Convertible Top Sealant and Protectant. It is a little more expansive. But it last almost a year for each application."
1,Just like Water,This is suppose to last 1 year or more will it lasted about 2month I did everything like the directions sad would like to get my money back its a joke
5,Great for changing LED bulb color,I used strips of this in the bed room to cover LED track lighting that we installed over the collar ties. This produces a light that is in between incandescent and candle light. Love it!
5,great,"Elfabet is a cute little fairy alphabet book. Each letter has a page dedicated to it and only has things on that page that begin with that letter and has a short rhyme. For example. the letter A has a picture of an acorn, an apple, and ant and an apple blossom and a little sprite. And in the border of the picture there is an aardvark, an alligator, and alpine asters. The rhyme describes the elf's action and for A is as follows, A is for Acorn Elf always acrobatic. Fun for all ages."
2,Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 1 HC,"Although the book was a thorough accumulation of Marvel characters, the pictures were in black and white, and the level of artistic talent was limited. The inexpensive printing shows and I was completely dissatisfied with the flimsy pages and grainy print."
2,Waste of Money,"Everyone already knows what Captain American, Hulk, and Wolverine have done in the comics. I thought this book would be an (almost) complete encyclopedia of marvel characters. Due to its small size I just figured it would provide brief descriptions of each character. It doesn't even cover all of the first x-men. And yes, everything was just cut-and-pasted from the marvel website.Don't judge a book by its attractive cover!"
3,Not that bad,"After reading some of the really harsh reviews on this book, I feel I have to defend it. Yes , the lack of classic artwork is an abomination and I agree that many of the people writing Marvel now know less about the characters than a lot of us older fans but the book was still fun to read and informative to those of us who have not kept up . The Power Rankings was effective and for those of us that do not have thousands of dollars to spend on back issues, the Essential Reading is helpful.The Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe still rules but I sure do not want to have to wait through two more years of Devil Dinosaur and Paste Pot Pete entries to get to some great characters. But I'll tell you I have no idea what would make me buy Volume II."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I purchased my first one and had to return it the same day. The DVD player didn't recognize that I had inserted a DVD. I brought home the second one, but this one worked. I noticed that after about 2 months, the DVD was sticking, so I cleaned it. The cleaning CD even got stuck! I'm lucky if I can watch a DVD without it sticking 50 times. Find a more reliable model, this one stinks!"
1,"Great concept, poor quality","I have owned the JVC HR-XVC25U Progressive-Scan DVD/Hi-Fi VCR Combo for 3 months now. In this time frame, I exchanged one unit within two weeks of purchase and am hoping I can do it again today. The reason, when I insert a DVD or CD, it tells me there's ""NO DISK"" in the drive.When the unit works, I really enjoyed the picture quality and features of this product from JVC but I'm afraid after this experience, I'll be taking a pass on this brand from now on. There's just too many quality products out there competing for my $200."
2,Product lasts only 1 year or less,"We loved this unit until two weeks ago (after 11 months of use) when it suddenly died. Ok, it maybe cuz my two year old did something to it, but we are not sure. Even if he did shove something in the VCR slot (which is possible) - the DVD player should still work, and it won't! The power mechanism flickers on and off and seems to try to initialize the VCR and then poof - the whole unit dies. over and over. No need to try to fix such an inexpensive product."
1,THIS PLAYER SUCKS,The DVD player freezes all the time. It gets worse the more you use it. If you let it sit with the power off for a few days you can usually watch 1 DVD before it starts freezing again. Now our remote control is busted (and we haven't used it that much). We cannot get the VCR set-up to take line 1 as input so cannot use the VCR to record from our replay TV or our camcorder. I will NOT buy another JVC product again.
2,DVD door broken from start,"Purchased this unit refurbished online, which I won't do again. Doubt any repair had gone on at all. From the start the DVD door would not open with the remote or the button on the unit. You could hear the motor trying, the machine just showed ERR across the front of the screen. Called JVC, they talked me through a reprogram, which of course did nothing, then suggested I take it in for repair! Yeah, right. While moving the unit around I could hear something rattling, so I unscrewed the side and shook it out, a broken chunk of plastic and a plastic dial, I would imagine the DVD door opening mechanism. Good thing it had been refurbished, eh? On the plus side, the VCR side worked fine, good picture and sound. Did not try recording. The remote was nice, thorough yet easy to use, and worked great with the TV. I was considering trying the unit again until reading all these reviews. Those of you that got well functioning units, it sounds like you got lucky. I'm looking elsewhere."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!!,"I am now on my 2nd unit and this one just crashed. Unit is not able to play any DVD and or CD. I am going to have to go thru the hassle of pulling it out of my rack, box the unit up and ship it back. If you read this and still decide to purchase, you may want to keep box."
5,Good Product,I don't know who the bad reviews from below are coming from... but I have had nothing but enjoyment from this unit. I use the DVD player heavily... but the VCR part only once or so a month... however I have had absolutely no problems.
1,VCR Component Doesn't Work Well,"I did quite a bit of research and decided on this vcr/dvd combo because of the DVD flexibility, but was very disappointed with the VCR component. It produced all sorts of noise feedback when it hit rough spots on the tape it was playing, sometimes over and over every few seconds. I ended up returning it and am now seeking an alternative, and I rarely return items. I have a huge collection of video tapes and could not stand the thought of having to deal with all of that feedback. It essentially made it into a DVD-only player."
1,Item never received,I am so much disappointed as my credit card has been charged for the item. But the item is never received. I tried to contact the seller to no avail.
5,Good Album,"This is my first review, so don't hate me too much. Basically this is a collection of some sessions Jimmy Page did in the 1960's. I'm trying to expand my Page collection, and found this one was added recently. I think this a really good album, since he is playing other people's music.(meaning that he didn't write these songs A.K.A. Led Zeppelin) Very nice blues feel. You can hear his distinctive/signature guitar work in a lot of these songs. The liner only has a few pages of information, which is dissapointing. However this is the only dissapointing aspect of this album. Buy this one now! I'm sure they will be out of print soon since it is an import."
3,Empirical Study of Relapse,Book is a good reference for literature review on relapse prevention.Book offers little help in designing a relapse prevention program for patients.
2,Gobbledy-Gouke at its best,"While it does cover a range of addictions it is VERY techical and almost impossible for a layman to read. But, it does cover a lot and asses almost all addictions as well as eating disorders gambling and sexual crimes both seriously criminal and mildly criminal."
5,I love this movie.,"This is a great low key movie about two people who, by freeing two turtles, free their own souls. One of the things I like about this movie is that the two protagonists; Ben Kingsley and Glenda Jackson, didn't wind up sleeping together. Gee, maybe a man and woman can do things together and not have to have sex too."
2,Disappointed,"The story line was slow and a bit boring. The film is quite old so that didn't help, I'm sure."
1,Don't waste your time,"We saw this movie over 20 years ago, and it STILL tops our top WORST MOVIES list. Do not waste your time on this one. Take our word for it...we know why it hasn't been released on DVD."
5,The best out there,This is a great digital voice recorder. Use it to record anything and it can dictate to the computer. It also looks expensive.
4,A great low cost joystick,The blackhawk is a great joystick in terms of buttons. It is a little hard to program but it has great features. The movment is choppy but is okay for the price. It works with most games and really helps you play them.
2,"Good title, but very little useful content","This book is a rehash of a number of other general management and time management principles found elsewhere, which may still be of use for a lay-person but is certainly not for project managers or anyone else who manages multiple projects for their profession. There are a number of other books on program management which are much better suited for that purpose."
2,"OK, But no real practical advice, nothing groundbreaking","Being a successful manager , and being an avid reader, I was expecting this book to go a bit further than it did. I have read a number of project management books, and a number of management books, and I would have to say that this book is at best a rudimentary management book. If you are completely new to management then maybe this book would be useful. If you are an existing manager and are looking for practical advice on how to manage, track, and report on multiple projects, this book is not for you."
3,Precepts good execution poor,"THe book's precepts that reliability and consistency equal success and it's the formula that makes success is one right out of the CMM manual and a staple at Management Consultant firms.Unfortunately this book falls short of how to get there, other than some warm over Stephan Covey planner tips. Good for skimming but not much meat."
4,The Briefcase Series is a hit overall and this one is certainly excellent,"This is an excellent book with lots of practical knowledge having to deal with juggling multiple projects. As a former Director of both IT and Education in Silicon Valley, I found it to be concise and practical.I am a fan of all the books I have read in the Briefcase Series. They have a very direct, no nonsense approach that is very appealing to busy people. I have picked up many useful ideas from many of the books form this series.One of the difficulties of a middle level mangement position is juggling multiple projects. This book gives very useful and practical advice along these lines."
2,this game is horrible,"the game you are about to purchase stinks. I couldn't finish the game because I got bored of it. one of many downsides is you have to pay to save(aprox. 100 koins). when you die and need to continue, you need to pay a toll and each time you pay it goes up. the sword power-ups only last a short while. the boxers. what's up with the different boxers? they do nothing. the health isn't exactly the best way to go either. in short the game would have been better off on the PS1. if you are of the younger generation of gamers, this one's for you. otherwise rent it if you must."
2,What a bad bad game,"I picked up this game assuming that it would provide at least a littile bit of fun for me. What I found instead was frustration and regret for wasting $... on it. I graphics are pretty good, but that is about the only place Mazimo shines. The dificulty level is so extreamly frustrating that even doing something as simple as saving the game will have you pulling your eyebrows out. The gameplay is plain and simple, not fun. I played it for hours hoping I would start to enjoy it. It never happened though. Hopefully I can still return it. So if you enjoy wasting money and you hate yourself, this is the game for you!"
1,Very difficult,"This game is absolutely terrible. I tried it out at the store first then decided to buy it. What a mistake. This game is so dark, it's hard to see where you're going. It's actually a really difficult game and there are very few spots in the game that allow you to save. I don't recommend this game to anyone."
3,ghosts and goblins hack and slash,"Once upon a time there was an arcade game in the 1980's called Ghosts and Goblins. This game was later ported over to the original Nintendo system. It was a fun game, but one of the most difficult games i have ever played in 15 years of gaming. Maximo is reminiscent of Ghosts and Goblins, and this is not a bad thing. This is a three dimensional hack and slash game. It takes skill to stay alive. A similar game would be Medieval.The difference between Maximo and Medieval would simply be the amount of fun each game is to play. While overly easy, Medieval was a lot of fun. Maximo is just not that fun to play. I'm a fairly patient gamer, being a fan of RPG's, but i could not muster up enough interest to keep playing Maximo."
2,Not as fun as expected,"I recently purchased a PS2 and this was the first game I got. After reading great reviews I expected it to be a blast, but it wasn't.This was fun for a while, but it started to get boring. It was the same thing every level and not much variation. Maybe it was too hyped up for me.I should have got Ico."
2,What a let down.,"Your gaming skills will be tested here for your health is easily depleated and you have to pay to save your game (100 koins). The graphics are very detailed and bright. The music is even good, but that is where the game goes south. Horrible camera angles = certain death. Unfortunately, the camera creates enough of a problem playing this game that it really does take away about 50% of the enjoyment and you end up just getting a little too frustrated. But you REALLY want to like this game because everything else is very nice."
5,Maximo is max fun!,"this game is about as much fun as you will find for its price, i loved it all the way through and i recommend it for anyone who is a fan of video games"
4,Jeff's review,"This game is a bit repetitive and boring , It is worth renting on a rainy day , the graphics are average , I found myself getting lost and unable to figuer out ware to go in order to finish a level.I say rent it !"
4,Entertaining,"Very entertaining game. Graphics and sound are above average, and the gameplay is excellent. Challenging enough for experienced gamers, but not too detailed or complicated. Some will complaing about the ""save game"" method, but I didn't find that it bothered me much. Wish there were more games like it out there.For the price, this game is well worth it. Highly recommended."
3,saving stinks - does it even exist?,"let me start out saying: i was pretty dissapointed.first of all, why did they make the saving so terrible? i rented this game and i still havent figured out how to save the darn thing. i read another review and it said something about a save pool and paying coins to save. if they just stuck to the simple-press start, save game, save complete, i think the game would be alot more enjoyable. the graphics are stunning, the music is perfect, but if you cant really save, whats the point of buying maximo?oh, yeah, and why does everyong complain about too many enemies? i'd actually like to have a little more. although they do cluster them a bit. somtimes it gets a little frustrating, but if your willing to spend 4 hours trying to save, buy this game. if you like the traditional:press start, save game, save complete,keep maximo out of sight."
2,I expected better...,"If it wasn't for the 4,000,000,000,000 enemies this piece of junk throws at you, I would have liked it a tad better. The story is good, the graphics are good, and every other item is fine. But having all your armor blown away in a micro- second, all your money being tossed to a crow, and all lives being thrown out the window, you just can't get excited when you start playing. I really do wish I hadn't wasted 50$."
5,a blast from the past,"Maximo reminds me of why I fell in love with video games 20 years ago. This game is tough, something missing from many games of the past 5 years! It will require dedication on your part to get the most from it, just like it's 8 & 16 bit predecessors. The control is tight and easy to learn. The graphics are sharp and comical. The music is reminiscent of the classical age of gaming. The theme will bring a smile to the face of my fellow ""old-school"" gamers. In short... if you miss the golden age of gaming, buy this game. If you are curious about what all us old timers are always rattling on about, rent it. Most of all, have fun!"
2,NnyCW for Capcom City,"Probably the most unknown Resident Evil game of them all, solely for it appearing on the GBC. The game plays like a 3rd person adventure, then when in combat with a zombie or creature, switches to a first person view where you your shots to choose where to shoot them. Overall, for a Resident Evil game, it isn't the best. But for a Game Boy Color game, this is one of the best. So, if for some reason you've never played a handheld more advanced than the original Game Boy or the Game Boy Color or if you're a diehard Resident Evil fan, you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, you could probably find a better way to spend your money. NnyCW for CapCity"
5,resident evil at its best!,this RE is not as scarey as the others i got this one a few weeks ago (rated T for gore and blood and horror). AND ITS GRATE!(P.S. if you like this game try RE2 its pretty good too)
2,right game wrong system/storyline,"Wow i had no idea what to expect going into this game because it is a Resident evil title on the game boy color. CONS: bad graphic,storyline has no relevance towards past and future titles,bad checkpoint system, overly difficult, repetitive, backtracking. PROS none..so why did i pay $30 for this game,, simply to warn you not to buy it. i own an like almost every other Resident evil game ever made. so when i say this game is a short irrelevant mistake not even made by capcom you shouldnt waste your time. (only 2hrs to beat game, no replay value) there is 2 bosses in the game an you fight the same one 7 times before finishing the game. this game is useless avoid it like the plague"
2,Disappointing,"This book is largely a regurgitation of the very limited information that is already widely available. Reading it was superfluous. Most of what Kobren covers is cosmetic management of the problem; the advice on diet applies only to the worst lifestyle offenders, and he paints finasteride (Propecia) as a panacea, which it definitely isn't. The book is thin, both physically and in terms of content.The irony is that Kobren claims to be a debunker and ""consumer advocate"", and this book is supposed to be his vehicle. To an experienced eye, it just looks like he is joining the rush to make money from male insecurities about hair loss.The answers to male pattern baldness will come, eventually, but they won't be found in this book. Save your money, do your own research, talk to a dermatologist, take care of your health (good advice anyway), and you'll be further ahead than you will be after reading this."
1,NOT GOOD,Keeps on reccamending creek water and witches brews?! No clue what this means?! Bad book! I would not reccomend. It dosen't make any sense. Theres about 20 blank pages! One page is just question marks??????? No baldness cures
1,Where do I start?,"I must say, this book did absolutely nothing for me. It was horrible. If a guy is such an expert on hair then why is his so disgusting. Diets are not going to help people grow their hair back. Any permanent solution would cost thousands of dollars. By the way, is this guy a 50 year old trying to be 20?! You're not cool, you're not funny. Quit doing a show about ONLY hair!! Quit, just quit now. Stop. Please do us all a favor and just give up on yourself now. Go back to managing a Hard Rock restaurant."
4,This book was very helpful!,"With the use of this book, supplemented with extensive research on the internet, I was able to thoroughly inform myself on all the currently available options with hair loss. I've decided to take a ""natural"" herbal approach, and will update with another review if I meet with success. Reading this book (and various internet sites) has been very theraputic for me. I am no longer so concerned about losing my hair. I'll give the ""cure"" that is within my value system a try (a alternative herbal treatment), and if that doesn't work- I'll just be bald and proud and keep my eye open for any future possibilities. That way I can say I tried at least. Also don't forget that your reading the authors personal biases in this book too, and that reading other material would be highly recommended."
1,Just terrible,"It's no wonder the author wants you to avoid ""snake oil"" remedies, I've never read such an adder. My eyes were closed but now I see:The Secret History of the Reptilians: The Pervasive Presence of the Serpent in Human History, Religion and Alien Mythos"
4,helping the balds while advertising,"This book shows us all, I mean the balding men and women, we are not alone. The doctors who seem to be living in Mars have to read this book as well in order to notice whats going on the planet of hair-free.Frankly, I love the book but it s a bit kinda smelling advertisement."
4,Ignore the TV ads and read this,"Like many of you, I've wasted a lot of money on products I knew (deep down) really couldn't work. This book discussed them, but more importantly it discusses what really works.I've taken the step of surgery and now 2+ years later I'm happy every day I comb my hair, my real hair. My doctor recommended this book (he's mentioned in it, Shapiro). Don't let the details of surgery scare you, it's nothing and this book shows you how simple (but time consuming) it is."
2,Better than his Dilbert book,"Well, Solomon may have finally written a book that isn't obviously a steamer. Compared to his book deconstructing Dilbert and weightily concluding that Dilbert represents a betrayal of the interests of the working classes, or any of his other pomposity-laden blather, this book has a cognizable argument. Of course, maybe a hundred or more other authors make the argument far more cogently. But give Solomon his due, he correctly observes that not all of the reporting on Iraq or White House explanations of the rationales for invading Iraq are entirely factually correct. But then again, it's pointing out the obvious, everyone pretty much acknowledges it, and Solomon's heavy-handed heavy-breathing style of writing and analysis pretty much consigned this book to the remainder bin as of the date of publication."
3,Alternative to corporate media..,"This book brings up a few points that are not publicized in the main-stream media in regards to the situation in Iraq. It could be beneficial for those who don't read alternative press, and would like to familiarize themselves with a non-corporate media view. However, if you are looking for an in-depth analysis of the situation in Iraq, you might be disappointed in the book.Personally, I thought that the chapter on self-censorship in the media was the most thought provoking."
4,Excellent book for first time bible studiers.,"Compact, easy to read and informative, this book helped take to fear out of picking up the Bible for the first time. By getting an understanding of the different books, it was much easier to read and understand the Bible itself."
2,disappointment,"I dislike this game... the only good level is the storming the beach level...very intense...but after i played call of duty..it left me wishing call of duty made a storming the beacxh level...can u imagen?..call of duty is a far superior wwII game..this is way too linear..and in war u dont fight all by ur lonesome...ur surronded by men a lot..this game is too linear..follow the path shoot shoot..and it would be ok...but i found myself getting incredibly frustrated.. i get frustrated with a lot of games but if it frustrates to tyhe point where i just say ""screw it"" and sell it...its bad..im not a great gamer...i suck at games, ill admit...but still"
5,Mike's Review Of Medal Of Honor : Frontline,"Medal of Honor : Frontline had to be one of the best first person shooters ever made. It was way better than the last one (Allied Assault). It gives you the feel of being in World War II. The environments are very well done. Everything was great. Even the replay value is high!Jimmy Patterson is sent into enemy territory to find a special plane that could determine the fate of WWII. You play as Jimmy and go to many places. You storm the beaches of Normandy. You travel through mine shafts. You go to parties. You travel the streets of Germany.This game's weapons are great. You recieve pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, grenades, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, and many more.The graphics are nicely done. It was very realistic.I loved the game. Nothing compares to it. It is a must buy! Trust me! You'll get hooked!Rated Teen for strong violence and brutality."
4,A Real War,"A great game and is so realisic and real.I played this game about 100 times and I never get board because your enemys do diffrent things.The only thing is the view you get.All you see is the gun.Some of you like it like that but it makes me dizzy and I get a headache,so dont play it to long."
4,Metal of Honor is sooooooo cool,"Between the supurbness of the graphics and the great gameplay, this game should be on your ""wish list."" Armed with a springfield sniper rifle and other weapons, you travel through 20 levels and 6 different missions. After explaining all this, don't you think you should buy this game especially from Toys R Us? I think so. Hurry, and buy this great video game!!!!!!!"
4,"Saving Private Ryan, the game.","The first and second levels of this game are like Saving Private Ryan,but with only a few diffrences like for instance when the ramp on the higgens boat goes down the men are blown up not shot to peices.The only thing that stinkes is that there is no multi-player that is why I gave it four stars.All in all its a great game. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes WW2 or medal of honor."
2,So close to being great,"I thought the graphics and the story line where fantastic. I could not get past the poor aiming capabilities of the game though. There was nothing worse then being riddled with bullets as you are trying to get the cross hairs to line up on the target you are trying to hit. Also, the AI doesn't compare to Metal Gear Solid's AI. There was no sneaking in this game, as soon as you turned a corner you where getting shot at.On the other hand, The opening sequence should go down as one of the best opening sequences in a video game. That alone may make the game worth owning. Unfortunately it goes down hill from there."
5,Best WWII on PS2,"Without a question this game is best WWII on the PS2 console right now, one the best WWII games ever for that matter. The sound & graphics are so unbelieveable you won't believe it. Really authentic situations and the storylines are another thing that I give an A+. If you've got PS2 pick this game up if don't have it, well worth the money. Bravo to EA Sports."
4,"Very Good Game, Some Major Flaws","FIrst off let me start by saying that this is a great game, coupled with some major flaws. In this game you take the role of a ""Super-Soldier"" and must fight the nazi warmachine all on your own. I mean, how can a single man do all of this? Thats where the word ""Super-Soldier"" comes into play. Below is a list of the pros and cons of this World War 2 title.PRO:-Very nice graphics-The only World War 2 title availible for the PS2.-Most weapons look realistic-Enemy AI is excellent, at the normal difficulty settingCON:-Control scheme is very difficult to use properley. Many times you will take severel shots before you aim at the enemy target.-There are various gliches, but they do not interfere drasticley with the game itself.-NO Multiplayer. This is a major flaw-Very short. Most players will complete this game in 5-7 hours.Overall:88%The choice is yours. You as a consumer must decide if this is worth [price]."
1,Disappointing,"Ok, I guess I am a PC gamer at heart. I wanted to play this game on my PC, but couldn't since I didn't have the right specs. So, I played it recently on a friends PS2 over a long weekend of gaming... This game blows on the PS2. I am sorry, but the controls are horrible. The PS2 controller has to be about the worst design for playing FPS games. Just utterly terrible. As for the game itself, there were some definite good parts, but for the most part, very underwhelming. Check some of the other reviews here for more details on the various negatives of this game. I am sorry, but this is very much overrated."
1,Who are these people who review this stupid game,"The beginning of the game is good. Kind of like saving private ryan, but then the graphics go bad after that. I don't understand these gamers that make a game look great on TV, then you buy it and it is terrible. Don't buy it, rent it first."
2,"great eye candy, boring game",I sold this after playing it for about 2 hours. Beautiful but boring as can be. I'll take GoldenEye on N64 over this game anyday.
1,Wait to get this for Gamecube or X-Box,"First things first, I'm a big PS2 fanboy. I have a PS2 and I don't even want the others. There is one thing about this game though that really irks me, EA already has it made for PS2 without a multiplayer, and they are GOING to release it for Gamecube and X-Box with multiplayer. What is it with EA? Why do they always have to make better products for the other systems? PS2 is just as good as the others..."
4,Awsome But Short,"This game was very good in all catagories. It was easy to get use to the controller, the gamplay was great, and the graphics were the best that I have seen on PS2. However, this game is kind of short. But other than that, this game is awsome."
4,Great WWII Action!!!!,This game offers some great WWII action. The D-Day mission seems very realistic and the weapons rock. The mission depth and variety is top notch. The missions are never too easy or too hard. I only wish there was some kind of a multiplayer mode.
4,awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,it feels good to play the past. it allways feels great when bullets are zipping past you.and having a tomson in your grasp
1,Oh No,"Please people do not waist your money on this game. i beat it in one day. there is no blood and no profanity. it gets very repetetive after the first couple missions. the only fun part is the first level and thats about it/ the aiming is horrible and the human graphics are VERY VERY weak. even the ending mini movie is boring. the only type of games EA should make are sports games, cause thats about all they can do right. so please, all you people reading this, just go to a blockbuster or hollywood video and rent it for a day."
5,so cool,"I have the full Medal of Honor Frontline Game. Iam a WW2 buff. The play is outstanding. I served in the military from 1985-1993, Iam also a Gulf War Veteran. The combat sounds is so real it brought back some real memories of combat in the gulf, minus the sound of jets screaming overhead. Get this game EA has done it again!"
1,Not one of the best of EA's or MoH titles out there.,"Metal of Honor: Frontline was not a good game. As with most MoH games, the back story is decent enough to bring in the player and go through missions and get a feel of combat during WWII. Where this fails is the games feels like the development was rushed. A lot of the the art assets and animations do not look good at all. Most of the missions feel like other missions pulled out of the various PC versions and quickly slapped together for the PS2.Did I enjoy this game?: no.Would I recommend this:? nope, unless you are a video game collector."
4,Could have been 5 stars.,"Metal Of Honor Frontline is one of the best,might be the best,but if they made it longer I would of made it 5 stars."
2,okay but..,"its ok but i didnt think it was to realistic. it was fun, had a good choice of weapons. but the bloody tanks were rubish. i must tell you, if you war, buy call of duty or moh rising sun."
5,MoHFL,"Another great acheivment in the Medal of Honor series; this may not fill the needs of those who absolutely must have blood and guts, but it suits me just fine. The graphics are superb, and there are only a handful of times i felt like i was playin a mission from Allied Assault. If you are a MoH fan, be sure to snag this one. Good hunting to you all."
3,MOH is fun but very hard,"At first I thought that MOH was awesome, but I ended up playing in invincible mode because it was so easy to be snuck up on and killed and there was no way to save the game in the middle of a mission. This greatly decreased my enjoyment of the game, especially since there are so many good first person shooters that have the save at any time feature."
4,A 4 star vote for Frontline,"Medal of Honor: Frontline is a great game as other reviewers have said. The graphics are great since it provides a lot of detail to make it as realistic as possible. The sound is awesome too, it's like if you were in the middle of the war yourself. However the controls should have been improved. It is somewhat difficult to aim your gun at the enemy, it will take lots of practice to get the hang of it. The gameplay is also fun taking you to places like Omaha Beach, the Destroyed village, and the destruction of a U2 boat. However the AI (nazi) are too stupid to kill you. If you want a much better war game from the Moh line up, I recommend the PC game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. Trust me, you will enjoy Allied Assault much better than Frontline."
2,This game isn't that good.,"This game isn't as good as the reviews say it is. The first level especially is horrible. Aiming is a nightmare. Artificial Intelligence ain't that great. No gore. It isn't very realistic. The graphics are okay. If you want a good First Person shooter, you should get a PC and play return to castle Wolfenstein. Now that's an FPS. Now, the good things are, is that there are real events, that's about it. So don't bother, unless you're itching for a mediocre FPS. Enough said. Don't bother!!!"
4,Good / Great?,"This game which makes EA's Hall of Fame and Greatest Hits, is a good first person shooter game. This game is the best representation of the DDay invasion, you really can't go wrong with the opening scene of this game. The guns are realistic but hard to shoot. It really depends which game level you play as to how much fun you will have. This game does not stack up against Castle Wolfenstein, but it is a good game.Joseph Dworak"
3,it's o.k.,Medal of honor on pse one is almost as good as far as graphics but where it surpasses ps2 is in accurracy of weapons. PS 2 weapons are very inaccurate i find that i have to shoot the sniper rifle to get an accurate shot. Most of the other weapons waste to much ammo.
3,Pros and Cons,"Here is the Bottom line for this game.Pros:1. Loads of fun experiencing world war 2 battles.2. Awesome sound that keeps you on the edgs of your seat.Cons:1. A whole lot of glitches. People stand half way through doors at times.2. Animation for people is very boxy at times.3. Enemy AI is smart but your allies are all retards that stand around and get killed.4. Only about 3 out of 19 missions where you're actually fighting with more than just yourself which makes it incredibly unrealistic.5. There is no blood so it's impossible to see whether or not the person is reloading, injured, or dying.6. The aiming with the weapons is terribly inaccurate."
5,THIS GAME IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD!!!,"Immediately when I played this game I loved it. I am very interested in WWII, and this game is just Historically correct. It has good graphics and smart AI and the D-day level is just the best. The only bad things about the game is that you don't get to command any vehicles and some times enemies take to many hits, but this game is still the best out there. I recommend this game to everyone!! Why are you still reading this review when you could have already bought this game and be playing it right now. Ohh by the way some levels are pretty long so you will have fun playing it. Ohh come on, don't waste any time, and BUY IT!!!"
3,good but not great,"if you are one of the many that ran to the shops, from the moment you heard that this game was available, this review will come a little late. I loved playing this game, it was good fun And the graphics are amazing to say the least. however, if like me you went through various copies of the previous games in the series, you will probably experience the ""been there,done that"" feeling. It almost feels as if they tried to melt both previous games in one. All the weapons have allready appeared in the previous series, there are a few rail driving missions, but I found them to be a bit chaotic, I expected a much more creative approach from the programmers e.g. driving a tank, using British or other weapons, fighting some one else than the Germans for once. If the programmers wish to continue the series, they will have to be far more creative next time."
5,Must have for any WWII or action game fan...,"MOH Frontline is a fantastic game. The graphics live up to PS2 standards, the gameplay is smooth, and the sound effects are outstanding. The game opens up with the Omaha Beach landing. It is like being in the move ""Saving Private Ryan."" Of course, having the game start off like this gives the gamer a taste of what he/she is in for. An interesting fact, this game is inspired by WWII movies like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""U-571,"" and ""A Bridge Too Far."" If you liked these movies, then you better get the game, because you can be ""in"" these movies. A final thought: this game lives up to the kind of quality that ""Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty"" brought to the PS2. Oh yeah, and the full version is vastly improved from the demo version. Rating: 5 out of 5! :)"
4,Dramamine?,"I love this game, only if I could get through more than one mission at a time without feeling nausea. I thought it was just me at first, but I spoke to two other game enthusiast who have stated feeling the same light headedness when playing for more than an hour.I found that taking motion sickness pills help. Must be the opening scene of the game while at sea, heading towards the beach landing, HA(funny)! Other than the nausea, I still love playing this game. It reminds me of HBO's, ""Band of Brothers."""
4,Best in the series,"This is the best in the series. Having only played it a bit, it lacks smart AL, but has a good amount of exploration."
5,a masterpiece...,"This game is truly one of the heavyweights on the PS2 system, it is amazing. I rented it for a week, and I'm desperately trying to wait for the price to come down to buy it, but it's not easy!! I find myself thinking about it all the time!! From the games first scenes, which are incredibly intense, the game just continues to get better. It's a BLAST to play, and the missions are just hard enough to make it fun and not as frustrating as many games can be. I would wholeheartedly recommend this game as one of the best games ever made!"
3,Your call,"I suggest renting this game before buying....It is a fun game but its replay value I found to be very minmal. Also the controles are not that great, they get by, but nothing special. Perhaps you'll love this game but I'm very glad I rented it before buying it because in my mind I'd be out [the money]"
2,Gamer,The 1st level where u r on omaha beach is great...its unique and original. However after that it becomes the ususal...you are the only 1 in an area and its all up to you.. No one is ever assisting you and its just the same as other FPS (with exceptions) The graphics are great and so is the sound. I recomend you to buy it if you enjoy games like James Bond. But if you are looking for a game where teamwork is reguired throughout the game i suggest you put down the PS2 and go back on your computer and purchase games like counter-strike...ghost recon....Global Operations ect ect ect
4,MOH,"I think Medal of Honor is a real awesome game. It's got really good graphics and is close to reality. The only one thing that I didn't like about the game was that it was only 1 player. If it was a muli-player game, i think it would be close to one of the best also depending on how they would make it. Other than that I think MOH is a good game both for young and old adults."
3,DON'T BUY IT IF YOU GET DIZZY EASILY,"BOUGHT THIS 1 YEAR AGO AND IT'S IN THE MIDDLETHIS IS GAME IS ONE OF THE WEIRDEST SHOOTERS I PLAYED BESIDES METAL GEAR SOLID 2! THE GRAPHICS ARE KIND OF WEIRD BUT THE AUTHENETIC VOCIES OF GERMAN SOLDIERS MAKE IT UP! THE GAME GETS CONFUSING THOUGH. THE FIRST LEVEL WHERE YOU TRY TO LEAVE SHIP AND PASS THE BARRACKS TOOK ME 1 HOUR JUST TO COVER THE WOUNDED SOLDIERS. THIS GAME ALSO GETS YOU A HEADACHE AFTER YOU PLAY. OVERALL, JUST GET MEDAL OF HONOR RISING SUN!"
2,COULD be nice.....,"This could be a great game if it werent for a few major flaws.The controls are absolutely awful and counter intuitive, even the menu on choosing a custom controls setup is very user unfriendly. The ridiculous 'rating' system for games, movies and everthing else in this country result in very unrealistic gameplay. I am not interested in gore for the sake of gore but an enemy soldier just falling without any blood effects at all after being hit by a tankshell is just stupid. Again this could be a great game but it is not. Get rid of these stupid ratings and grow up."
1,Want to play against walls ?,"This game has same old problem as in Medal Of Honor 1 and 2 for PS 1. The control is too slippery and moves very fast which will make you dizzy in less than 30 minutes playing the game. You play most of the game facing and bumping into walls. Due to this flow there is no sense of precision. You can never target your enemy precisely unless you move your joystick very slowly, which is bad because you are vulnerable to enemy fire.There is no sense of reality, you can take 6 to 9 shots from your enemies and still live, while you get to shoot them with just one bullet.The only good thing about this game is the graphics. But there is nothing new and innovative about this since PS2 is supposed to have good graphics.Compared to other first person shooter like the non-dizzy Red Faction this game is lame. Compared to the Rainbow Six series and Operation Flashpoint this game is a joke!"
2,"Rent it, don't buy it","Way too easy. The game is beatable on ""hardest"" mode in no time. Decent graphics; but, essentially the exact same game as the original 007 Goldeneye for Nintendo (the older one). Much better to rent. Gets boring, no exciting features."
3,MOHF,"Great graphics and sound. VERY linear, the game feels like its on rails, and it gives you no freedom. The AI is also very stupid, and the controls [stink]. This game is worth renting, but don't buy it (I'm glad I didn't)."
2,Why settle for single player,This game is fun but my question is why did they settle for single player. What I mean is this game like many others could have easily been made a 2 player split screen cooperative game. Then I would say the perfect game. Who agrees with me that this would be the greatest game if it were split screen cooperative. Over all this is a good war game but it would be better if it were 2 player split screen cooperative. Well its just a tip for the next medal of honor game Well click the yes under the review if u think this game should be coop and click no if u think it shouldnt. Thank you.
4,Your the Soldier,"This game is great, it has amazing graphics and real sound. You are a soldier named James Patterson and have been sent back to France after being rescued from there to fight on the beaches of Normandy. The graphics are amazing. I felt like I was there until my friend brought me back to reality saying, ""Thats awesome, Please let me play."" The objectives aren't impossible and the game provides hours of fun and very little gore. Even younger kids could play it. The only flaw is the sensitivity of the joystick. It is nearly impossible and very frustrating to shoot from too far away because of that sensitivity. Overall, it's one of the best games I've ever seen!!!"
5,Art Of War!!! A+++,"I am not a fan of first person shooter games, as this is one. But with this game, I got hooked as there is action right off the bat. The opening is like playing in ""Saving Private Ryan"". This game makes you feel like you are actually in the war. The weapons are just what you would have used in WWII. Each mission you have is given to you by the commanding officer, but if you pause the game by hitting start, you can see all the objectives of the mission that you must complete. As I said, I don't like 1st person shooter games, but this one is a must have. Especially if you have a knack for history. Even if you don't, buy this game, you won't regret it."
4,Awesome game on ps2,Well medal of honor frontline is the best game out but the only thing wrong about it that it does not have that many missions. Because i have finished the game already and i have had it for 3 days. I hope they will make another medal of honor on playstation 2 i really do want another one. War games are the best
5,Back in TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111,This game is so awesome. better than oo7 goldeneye. Has stunning grapghics and meticuliosly detailed makes you feel like you are actually in WWII.
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this game and it has proven to be pretty interesting. The problem is the squad based missions where Patterson is doing all of the shooting. You can't do a ""cover me"" operative. The history lesson is cool because the children in school now are not learning about this war, they are learning about the Gulf War. My children get something of a history lesson. Overall, I really enjoy playing it."
2,Nothing compared to the Computer Version,"If you have access to a half decent computer than don't even bother getting the PS2 version of this game. Allied Assault is so much more entertaining than Frontline, it's not even funny. I turned Frontline off in 20 minutes and played Allied Assault instead. Not only does Allied Assault have single player action, but online multiplayer, which the PS2 version does not have. Get Allied Assault on PC, and forget this one."
4,"Very good game, but limited replay","What I love about this game is the incredible control system and the realism of the WWII battles and weapons (even down to the long time it takes to reload--it just makes things more challenging). The thing that kills this game for me is that after I finish one of the 20-30 minute levels, I have no particular desire to play it again. I'm willing to put up with aggravating difficulty and lack of save points when I'm struggling to finish the game--because I have a goal. But when I'm only trying to get medals for my performance (and I seem to fufill all the requirements and still not get them) it all becomes less fun. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent game! The first time through, anyway."
4,"Great game, but could be better","As great as this game is, every encounter degenerates into a button-mashing fire fight. It's virtually impossible to sneak up on enemies, and once you shoot one enemy soldier, even if it's with a sniper rifle from behind cover and from far away, or with a silenced pistol, every soldier in the area comes running.A little bit of Solid-Snake style stealth would make the game more fun. You are supposed to be a spy, after all.That said, the graphics, the sound, and the controls are spectacular. The small ammo capacities and slow reload times of the weapons are very realistic. The Omaha Beach sequence is just unbelievable. I'm not a big fan of FPS's, but this one's fun. Good story, very varied gameplay, and plenty of cool little details."
5,MOH:FRONTLINE,"THIS GAMES AWESOME!BUT ITS REALLY HARD EVEN ON EASY,WORST OF ALL THERES ONLY ONE CHAET SO FAR!BUT I PREORDERED THIS GAME AND HAVE PLAYED IT NON-STOP!THE MOVIES AND GRAPHICS R INTENSE,YHE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS THE CONTROLS ARE HARD.ITS WORTH THE MONEY!"
2,"Review from game, not the demo version","FOr all those that played the demo, it's nothing compared to the mixed themes of this game. When do chefs on a U-boat thtow knives at you? ANd men shoot through walls? Men quickly change from the marines to the army in a matter of weeks. This game has terrible AI, limited gameplay, and no replay value due to a total lack of fun and multiplayer. Very disappointing after the great Allied assault pc game. This game is not great, but a sad excuse to anybody that compares it to GOldeneye. Very disappointing and not worth buying or even renting. Nothing about it's good. So stop with the good reviews and get lives you 12 year-old newbies to the first-person shooter world. It's better without your reviews and lies about this game."
2,it's no call of duty.,"let's see, this game was made about 5 years ago.. maybe then, it was considered great, but now? nope! call of duty 1 for PC was way way better than this. no thanks."
5,HOT HOT GAME,IM TELLING U GUYS I GOT THE GAME TODAY ITS SO CRAZY AWESOME GAME ONE OF THOSE MUST HAVES PICK IT UP THE SECOND U START TO PLAY YOU'LL KNOW ITS WORT THE $$$
5,The Best Gmae for Ps2 since GTA3,"Everyone who is intrested in this game saw Saving Private ryan, now i bought this game today and when i played i was Stunned. The graphics are better then Allied Assault. The controls are 4 the graphics take it to the EXTREME of Ps2 VERY VERY detailed. I cant stop playin the game the First mission of the game is DDAY it is extremly hard if u play on Hard Mode. I recamend this game to people who like to kill Nazis and blow up stuff."
4,The best Medal of Honor game EVER!,"Im sure your wondering why I said it was the best MOH game ever but only give it four stars, well ill tell you. Im very dissapointed that the dead guys dissapear. If im not mistaken in MOHAA the Nazis dont dissapear. Why cant they do that in this? All in all this is a great game if it werent for that id give it five stars. By the way ther is no blood in this game because the Nazis wore so many layers of clothing that the blood didnt go through the clothing."
4,"must have,mouthwatering.jawdrooping game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",this is one of the best games ever created EA has done it again! if you like cheating this games got it! cheat all you want hear are some sites that have the game cheatplanet.com happypuppy.com cheatheavan (these sites are for cheaters only!) here are some reasons to get the game you get disgusis in 2 levels awsome! very relistic weapons (not as butclose to the weapon graphics on MOHrising sun)great 1st person veiw great sound. here are some reasons not to get the game everyone looks the same what a ripoff! hard enemys somtimes it freezes and all you prgess is gon in the drink but mine just wen't back to the cheat code typewriter and the snipe zoom wen't back to the bonus screen easy to redo but it's still a muoth watering must havejawdroppingly fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,The best game ever!!!!!!!,"This is a great game. Its grafics are the best. Its realistic and its fun. You can fight on beaches, submarines, docks, cities, farms, houses, mines, and german army bases. You can fight with american or german guns. It has some mild launguage.If you like James Bond games you will love Medal of Honor Frontline.Its better than James Bond."
4,Number 1 game!,"Pros:great graphics,great guns,based on war world 2, millions of levelscons: really hard missions, and players dissapearThis game is great."
2,Not worth the time,"Sadly this ""well"" reviewed game is poor at best. I love a good FPS and this one doesn't make the cut. The levels are linear to the point of boredom. The graphics are subpar, though as is ften said the music is good. One good thing, often disparaged, is the reload time on the weapons is quite slow, frustrating but realistic. Still there are so many better games I suggest you avoid this one, at least rent it and save yourself the extra cash for a better game."
4,Great game--some drawbacks,"First, this is one of the most fun games I've played. That being said, i've also played Medal of Honor Allied Assault on PC. And while this game does well on PS2, there are some drawbacks, the most major of which is the controller. On PC you can aim with the mouse and move with the keyboard very precisely. on the ps2, you use both analog joysticks. while good, you just can't get the level of precision for aiming. i still find myself standing there trying to hunt around with the aiming stick to shoot a guy. that would never happen with me on pc. i've also noticed slowdowns on some levels. but other than that it's great. one thing i would like to see more of is squad based missions, where you're just one of a bunch of guys running and gunning. most of the missions here you're by yourself."
2,Rushed and Unoriginal,"I have played the first Metal of Honor and I loved it. However, this game does not improve on the Metal of Honor formula. Let me start off by saying what I love about this game; the sound is fantastic and some of the missions are actually fun. Now let me tell you about the bad:The hit detection for most of the A.I is almost non existent. The controls for your aim is so oversensitve that hitting your enemy is a challenge in itself, especially where there is no auto aim. The computer Nazis have an advantage over you, they can move and aim better than you can. Some missions have you doing the same thing over and over and it gets really old, really fast. Take away all the fancy sound and WWII theme and you have a less than average, not so fun game. Rent it first."
4,Video game,"Son loved it he said it was a good addtion to his collection, need to buy more of theis type. Good quality great price."
5,The bar is set HIGH!!!,"Other Video Game makers need to take note. Metal of Honor has certainly set the bar High. This game ROCKS...Where do I start the sound track certainly sets the mode, the authentic weapons, the setting of the Nazi occupied territories really gets you itching to shoot something. The ease of controlling your character, Patterson is a letal Nazi killing machine. This reveiw doesn't do this game justice, Rent..Buy..Borrow...whatever it takes. You won't be dissapointed."
4,Pretty good,"The game itself is relatively simple but fun to play.I'll admit that it took me a while to get used to it and that's because the game is set in World war 2 and I'm used to more modern weapons instead of just simple handguns and the like. But once you get used to the game, you hardly notice the primitive armaments anymore."
5,The Saga Continues,"Great game, great story line, finally interaction with other U.S. troops. The reloading of weapons is too slow but realistic. If you enjoy the MOH series you'll love it."
2,Decidedly mediocre,"Maybe I'm just getting old. But this game seems to have no identity. As a shooter it's pretty bad. Trying to aim the crosshairs to shoot the enemy is an exercise in frustration, it's just not possible to precisely aim using the Playstation 2 analog sticks the way you can using a mouse on a computer. So many times I was in a small room with a German soldier, and I couldn't even put the crosshairs on him, and my character was like 4 feet away! Sometimes it's hard to hit a target just a few feet away even when you have a machine gun! These flaws might be forgivable if the story was any good... which it isn't. Another reviewer raved about the graphics, and I have to ask - were we playing the same game? Definitely nothing special here. This was my first foray into the ""Medal of Honor"" series, and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed."
1,Not Pleased,"I ordered this game 3 weeks agao and paid for rush shipping!! When I contacted the provider to inquire upon the status of my order, I was told that the game was sold to someone else and I would recieve a credit. I am STILL waiting for said credit."
1,Worst game ever,"come on i bought the game on the first day it came out and i beat the game on that first day it's just too easy to beat the first level is fun ,but that's the only level that's fun goshyou can't even get in a tank or fighter plane!! ..."
2,It's not good at all!,"When i first played the game, i thought i was in heaven BUT, now that i've beaten it way over 7 times and i got no other good games..."
1,Yea Right,"last time i cheked WW2 wasent won by 1 man this games is good until the sub level and by that time you have already beaten the game...the game is short, boring, easy, and just stupid, looking at the first level you whould say its a great game...thats what i thought too, then i got to the sub level and wondered ""were is my back up?"" fighting armys is fun yea but is i wanted to do that I whould buy MGS2...this game isent great well its not even good its uhhh unrealistic...."
1,Insult,This game is an insult! I want all you fans of this game to tell me how many people died in World War II !!! This is an insult to all the men that fought in WWII. These men fought a war and many died!!! I dont think any ...that are playing this game have even fought in war!!! Electronic Arts has just lost a fan! World War II was not a game!!!
5,NEEDS MORE STARES/ THIS GAME ROCKS,This is the best game ever. I am very intrested in WWII and this game is the the most historicly correct out there. I have been playing this game ever since I got it. It has very good graphics and smart AI and the levels are long and hard. The only down side to the game is you don't get to comand vehicles and enemys sometimes take to many hits. I recomend this game to anybody who likes shooters.
2,"Great Game, even better headache","The game itself isnt bad... the story line is alittle too easy.. you're pushed through this thing even if you try to fight it... my biggest problem with it... after an hour of play i get a pounding headache, my eyes water, and i feel sick to my stomach....The frame rate and jumping graphics are not something for the faint of heart..."
3,Beautiful Franco movie,"The story of ""Macumba Sexual"" is similar to that of the better-known ""Vampyros Lesbos"". Lina Romay plays Alice, a woman who has strange nightmares about a beautiful woman (Ajita Wilson). Alice is sent to close the sale of a house to Princess Obongo, who turns out to be the woman haunting her dreams.While not as psychedelic as ""Vampyros Lesbos"" or ""She Killed in Ecstasy"", ""Macumba Sexual"" has most of the things you're looking for (but don't always get) in a Franco movie, including great scenery and cinematography. There's not much of a plot, but then that's not usually what you watch Franco movies for. 3+"
2,Not packaged well,the books arrived quickly but corners of books were crinkled. Not packaged well. Books are ok though and usable thanks
5,A MUST FOR THE LOSS OF A BABY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE,"THE HOSPITAL GAVE ME THIS BOOK WHEN WE LEARNED THAT OUR DAUGHTER PROBABLY WOULD NOT SURVIVE LONG AFTER HER BIRTH. WE WERE FACED WITH SAYING GOODBYE BEFORE WE WERE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO SAY HELLO. SHEROKEE GAVE US THINGS TO THINK ABOUT. OUR DAUGHTER WAS STILLBORN AND DUE TO THIS BOOK WE MADE EVERY POSSIBLE DECISION BEFORE WE EVER GOT TO THE HOSPITAL. HER BIRTH AND THEN FUNERAL WERE DIGNIFIED THANKS TO THE SUGGESTIONS FOUND IN THIS BOOK! LATER I GOT PREGNANT AGAIN BUT UNFORTUNATELY MISCARRIED. I GOT THIS BOOK OUT AGAIN AND IT HELPED TREMENDOUSLY. I WILL FOREVER BE GRATEFUL FOR THIS BOOK AND WILL RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE FACING THE MISCARRIAGE,STILLBIRTH OR NEONATAL DEATH OF THEIR BABY. HAVING THE BOOK WRITTEN BY A WOMAN WHO HAD GONE THROUGH THE SAME THING MADE IT EASIER TO SWALLOW! I DIDN'T FEEL SO ALONE."
2,This book was not for me,"We lost our baby 2 months ago and I was more than ready to read some books and move forward! I started reading this book thinking it was spot on with what the author was describing. As I kept reading, the book did not keep me interested. It was repetitive halfway through and then I could not keep reading it. The book is written like a diary personal experience and I didn't like that. The book didn't help me at all."
2,Not impressed with the book.,"This book is written as a personal advice journal. There are very few things that are of use to my husband and I in dealing with the stillbirth of our son after the funeral. Most of the advice is centered around dealing with the news itself, the delivery, notifying family and friends. If you enjoy a book that is like reading a personal diary of one woman, this book is for you. I personally did not care for it as the situations discussed were behind my husband and I by the time we read it. We found that ""A Silent Sorrow"" was a better fit for helping us handle long term issues beyond the first week."
2,Empty Arms,"I read this book about 5 weeks after my daughter was stillborn on 2/12/01 at 39 weeks. It was very technical and dealt with the decisions that need to be made in the hospital or soon after. By the time I read the book, most of the decisions the book talks about having to make had already been made. It really has not been much help through my grieving process"
5,A Book that gave me so many insights,"That I lived in Jerusalem and not far from Aharon Appelfeld and read only other Israeli writers (the big 3: Oz, Grossman, and Yehoshua) and missed Applefeld is my great loss.Reading this slim volume was a huge experience for me as Appelfeld's sensibility in this book gave me an entirely new 'take' on a country I thought I knew, but through his descriptions, I felt a whole new relation to Israel and the Shoah.This book is both an easy and a profound read. Buy it. It's great."
5,Favorite votive candle scent lately,I would order this votive candle again. It is my favorite votive candle scent lately! Thanks.
5,Supple Coax Cable,"Monster Cable's coax cable is the only manufacturer that I have ever found that produces a coax cable with a supple jacket that doesn't coil and kink up. If you're looking for coax cable that will lie flat when uncoiled, then buy this!"
1,No service or customer support,"I bought and it did not work for the first time with my HDTV. I checked out the small and poor paper that contained the instructions and product details, but nothing helped. I try to find out the 800 customer service to check out if there is anything that I could do, but there is nothing about this product, even in the Samsung website. This antenna is made by Axession, that should be a company that became part of Samsung, the Samsung website and 800 number does not know about this product, weird no."
1,Useless--Waste of Money!,This did WORSE than my NON-amplified antenna (akin to zenith ZHDTV1) it was meant to replace. But costs more to own and to use!I had better luck with the amplified Samsung TV5.2 antenna (shaped like a space ship/B2 bomber). This model did improve upon my directional/non-amplified antenna in receiving HDTV signals.
1,DONT NOT PURCHASE!!,They sent me the wrong product TWICE!instead of a contouring brush they sent me an eye shadow brush!!! DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT! what a waste!!
2,These had a greasy after taste...ughhh!,"After having purchased the delicious, fresh baked tasting BOXED Bremner oyster crackers, I thought that these would be the same....just in a plastic package but I was wrong. I was really surprised when I tasted the first bag and immediately noticed a strange 'greasy' after taste in my mouth. Too much of that HYDROGENATED SOYBEAN OIL I guess!!! I am not sure what I'll do with the remaining 11 bags (bird food if they'll even eat it??) but I know that these crackers just do not taste good! It's sad that I will never buy Bremner ever again but that is what this discusting product has shown me.....poor quality control! Buy it at your own risk!"
5,"Beautiful illustrations, with a remarkable sweetness.","This book has entertained our kids over and over. The amazing thing is how prolific Kathleen Bullock is, yet she remains virtually undiscovered. It makes me wonder what determines the success and popularity of a book. I think that this book deserves to be treated as a classic on par with Beatrix Potter's ""Peter Rabbit""."
2,"full of fat, not so easy for me to digest either","These are absolutely full fat and quite unnecessarily so (the fat doesn't make them yummier as in ""what a treat"" but decidedly uckier, imo). I'd much rather splurge on something else for my fat. These two-serving bags come to almost 300 calories with very little protein. If the bags truly came in one-serving sizes and were cheaper, I might actually buy a smaller amount of them again someday. But I've had these bags for a few months already, and even though I have more than six months before expiration, I imagine I'll be looking for ways to give some away. This has been my biggest [...] grocery disappointment. I only give them two stars instead of one because for some shoppers the main point really may be adding fiber to your diet with calories and fat counting little. And maybe you would naturally gravitate toward full fat plain tortilla chips. If so, maybe this is a snack for you and a better option than your regular full-fat tortillas."
1,NOT AUTHENTIC VILLEROY & BOCH,"I bought this thinking it would make a lovely addition to my set of Cascara dishes, which are now a retired pattern. Unfortunately, this set is a made-in-china knockoff of a Villeroy and Boch item. The cannisters had facsimiles of the V&B markings on the bottom, but with mistakes such as ""cascara charm"" for the name of the pattern, and ""made in china"" rather than ""made in Germany [or Luxembourg]"" I returned this for a refund, as they were of poor quality and definitely not worth the price."
4,I love the chick in plastic wrap,"There's this girl in the movie who's bouncing around in plastic wrap, thrashing in a padded room, etc... she rocks!"
2,"Had potential, but failed miserably","The movie had interesting potential. It starts with a well framed concept of a box with mystical powers, and how a small group of people are willing to die to protect it, people hunting it, etc. From there, though, the movie spirals into a bunch of nothingness. It drags on and on about a washed up photographer who focuses on porn shots, and his painfully mundane life. The engaging concept shown in the beginning just runs out of steam. Could have been interesting, but is not."
1,Pirates-legend of a less than average platformer,"Stupid. When you start out you realize that you're a GIRL pirate. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but the feminine voice overs are awful. You beat an island and it's like ""Find your mother's grave,"" and when that's done, it says ""Liberate your fathers FOrtress."" and it does that with no story progression. This game has no storyline, it ... DOnt buy it."
5,buy this game for the ship battle,the two player ship battle mini game rules and that feature by its self makes this game a must have
1,Yar.. This Game Blows!!,"Wow. How dumb and repetitive can a playstation 2 game be? This one really really blows. The controls in both ship and land modes are unpercise. The backrounds look good but the animation [stinks]. When your ships blows up, theres this explosion sequence where your character just stands on the ship's deck like nothings happening. Basically that sums up this game, ""nothings happening""."
3,"half great, half boring","Running on land, sword fighting, and searching for items gets pretty tiresome, I think. It's standard fair...But sailing the seas and blowing up other ships with your cannons is a lot of fun. Great, even!If anyone from EA is reading this, I'd love to play a multiplayer version of this, where you sail the high seas and blow your friends out of the water. That's easily the best part.I think the storyline is highly improbable, if not dorky. ""My mother was a pirate?!?"" And having model-esque game leads for the sake of it is getting kind of old. So forget all that and spend as much time on the open ocean as you can!"
4,A Surprise,One of those games I never heard about and took a chance. Worth it. Ship battles alone made it worth it. Well done. Lots of exploration. Decent combat. No caves though. Lots of island hopping. This game was a good surprise.
4,Good game if you want to play a game of pirates.,"So I bought this game cheap from the used section under the main page for the game and I have to say for a decent price it is a great game but nothing extremely special. I looked into this game quite a bit and thought it was worth buying. What is great about this game is the two different modes to play in: on foot playing as a pirate captain and in your ship sailing the seas. There is really nothing too frustrating about this game so it is a game you really can play for fun and for relaxing. It also has a quick ship on ship multiplayer battle between two people or person vs computer. However, I do not consider this mode to be a whole lot of fun. I would say the reason you should buy this is for the campaign; it is simple enough to enjoy but still has challenges and items to find as well as puzzles and quests."
4,Flawed but entertaining,"This game is good fun if you like Pirate games. It is flawed - sometimes frustrating, too linear, and a[crummy]story, but if you like pirates, then the graphics and sounds are great fun.My biggest peeve is the ridiculous attempt to make the main character to be a 'goody' - you're a PIRATE for crying out loud! I suppose it was felt that it was immoral or dangerous for kids to play the role of a 'baddy'. The crazy thing is that in removing the historical context of story, the moral, historical and geographical lessons kids/adults might learn is lost. Or maybe this is what the establishment wants..."
2,not so great,"I don't think this book has any insights to offer.It's been about three months since I read it, and I will only remember it for one reason: the gimmicky setup.How so gimmicky?There's a university professor who gets addicted to drugs. One lurid night, he kills his brother. After being publicly disgraced, he goes to jail.That's not the plot, no. That's the backstory. In other words, this novel begins where you would expect it to end.But, while I haven't seen that done before, that doesn't necessarily make for a good book: what possible insights can it have to offer? That life thereafter, in a prison, will be miserable? Coulda guessed that.The story blew its wad before it even started, and had nowhere to go from there."
1,Falconer-Garbage,"I had such high expectations. Sadly, after only 57 pages, I felt the only appropriate place for this book was at the bottom of a litter box and in the trash...hopefully no one else will get their hands on my copy. It's disappointing that so many believe this book to be a worthy work. Or maybe they feel they must like it because someone said they should.I'll stick with Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes, James Joyce, Zora Neal Hurston,....so many GOOD things to read, so little time."
5,"Newsweek called Falconer ""A Great American Novel"" . . .",". . . and I agree! As implausible as it sounds, Cheever achieved literary greatness in a prison novel with its central character a college professor and murderer who is also a heroin addict and a guilty, closeted homosexual. ""Oh Farragut, Farragut, why is you an addict?"" asks his guard, and through flashback and reminiscence we learn how and why. One of those rare books that takes place largely in the mind but is truly gripping--and the Attica-like prison Farragut is confined to holds a few surprises of its own. It is hard to overpraise ""Falconer."" Honestly, if you don't like this book you don't like modern American fiction."
3,My favorite album of the last 3 years,"I think this album is absolutely gorgeous. It's predominantly down-tempo, acoustic, and has lyrics that get under your skin and stick in your head. This is the most heartfelt of their albums/EPs, in my opinion. The melodies are the most lyrical, and the instrumental choices accent and compliment that lyrics rather than hiding behind them or overshadowing them. Eef Barzelay strikes that oft-missed balance between nasal emo-indie-rocker vocals & sad country boy drawl - pretty damn good for an Israeli transplant in NYC. Clem Snide lived up to their surname on the Ghost of Fashion, & are too syrupy for my tastes on Soft Spot. You Were a Diamond finds the middle ground between cynicism and sincereity that is lacking in most of today's pop music. I highly recommend this album to anyone with an ear for the bizarre, irony, heartache, Nick Drake, & a little country twang."
1,Not very Bright,"I bought the light thinking it would be bright and very visible at least when it is dark out, but after installing it (which was a big hassle and ended up wrecking my alternator) I turned it on to see that it is barely even visible through the light tint of my trucks rear window, big disappointment."
2,Over-hyped,While worth listening too -- it just doesn't live up to the reviews or the hype. Somewhat of a disappointment; one that I don't care to play time and again -- on the self after 1 week.
2,?????,"I have one question...What The Hell Was he thinking??!!!!A few of the songs (""Hello"", ""Everybody Hurts"" etc.) fit his style. But Songs like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""..??? Does he realize what Kurt Cobain meant to a generation??? Does he realize that he made a mess of that song!!!?? Does he know what that one song means to SO many people???!!!I don't think he did.I don't think anyone his age would. Thats why he should never had attepted it. Like Pat Boone before him he just didn't get it.I'm all for trying new things...but please, stay within the relm of taste.Bottom line is that when I heard it, most of it just made me laugh.And I don't think that was what Mr. Anka was going for.Thank You."
3,"Funny, but boring","The songs are funny at first. You'll have a good time introducing them to people, and getting a laugh out of them. But, other than that they're boring. I can't see anybody actually sitting down and enjoying this album."
1,Terrible,"I have been a fan of Paul Anka's for a long time. The new cd has to be the worst I have ever heard period. He is a great songwriter...why would he want to ""jazz"" other peoples music.He has rewritten some of his own music to be modern. I suggest not to buy this cd."
1,In regards to musical abominations,"If I was Dave Grohl, I would tear Paul Anka limb from limb for dishonoring Kurt Cobain's memory this way. Paul Anka has sucked the life, the very soul out of this song with his abysmal crooning. After listening to it I had to hold my speakers up to my ears and listen to the REAL Smells Like Teen Spirit at full volume to cleanse my mind of this disgusting excuse for a cover.It's one thing to screw up Everybody Hurts (although I still feel sorry for REM), but utterly destroying Smells Like Teen Spirit and The Eye of the Tiger is a completely different thing.If you want to reach me, I will be in rehab for post-traumatic stress disorder."
1,"Amazon, Please don't insult me!","Oh, be serious: a CD of (sic) ""rock songs"" by the king of mid-seventies leisure suits? The ""You're Having My Baby"" guy? Look, I don't take drugs anymore, and I cannot conceive of the quantity necessary for ingestion to even sit thru a CD by this...this...individual."
4,This album mainly swings,"I am a big fan of big band swing music, which is one reason I love this album. The music is great, horns, vocal; all working well together. My only complaint is that not much of the original melody or chord progression was ever used. About the only part of the original songs that is used are the lyrics. He's a little like Richard Cheese or Weird Al, but it's not comedy and you probably won't recognize the tune from the music alone. The lyrics are the only thing that gives that away."
3,Not As Bad As U Might Think.,"Okay...First things First Sure it's kind of weird hearing these song in such a arrangement..but here is the but it's doesn't sound half bad sure some songs were not made for swing or big band arrangementsbut half the songs sound good like It's a Sin by Pet shop boys from euro-disco to a song you can sip a drink 2 others include blackhole sun, eyes without a face, wonderwalls,remember listen 2 it first without ."
3,Tongue n' Cheek Swing,"I purchased this CD and can say it's really not that bad. I take with a tongue n'cheek attitude. It's kind of cheesy maybe in some parts when you think about what the original songs sounded like but truthfully, I enjoy listening to it.He does justice to such remakes as Bon Jovi's ""It's My Life"" and Spandau Ballet's ""True"".Listen to it and judge for yourself. If you already like Sinatra and Bennett you might enjoy it. If you're a diehard Rock fan, skip this one."
3,"A real hoot, eh.....","There's a certain part of me that would like to see Quebec secede from the Confederation just so Celine Dion and Michael Buble and even Anka would have to go away for a while until they got new visas, yet there is a real funny aspect to this release. It seems as though Anka saw Bill Murray's bits as the lounge lizard doing rock songs and thought it was a great idea. What you have here then is an hilarious project inspite of the intentions. Hopefully, Anka cut Murray in on the royalties.If you are old enough to remember Frank Sinatra tackling (and that image is appropriate) some of McCartney's ballads, you'll understand the initial cringe factor that this project would inspire. But if you can get over that, then you'll also find a parody inspite of itself. Imagine BEST IN SHOW being a serious attempt at documentary and you've got it.I howl every time I listen to this CD, which thankfully I didn't purchase. It's a hoot."
3,Who will satirise the satirists?,"I've just seen Paul Anka perform ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" onThe Late Show with David Letterman.The performance was fine, with a big band and all.Then in the interview, Dave asks, ""Has this been done before?"", to which Paul Anka replies, ""No"".This is disingenuous, as the idea for this album is obviously inspired by Richard Cheese, a comedian who does lounge versions of some of the riper rock and hip-hop hits, complete with swear words.Judging this CD purely on musical terms, it is fine; however, in cultural terms, it is a rip-off of someone else's idea.I'm not say Richard Cheese was the first to do this, but he is the most prominent at this time and is the obvious inspiration for this CD."
3,"wiliam hung, meet your biggest fan paul anka......","say all that you want about this album. the bottom line is that it is not that different from pat boone's heavy metal outing. both were hoping that a collection of greatest rock hits would trick the consumers, who otherwise wouldn't be caught dead with paul anka and/or pat boone related items, into buying their albums.you can spin it by saying that paul anka was serious about this cd, but do you really think pat boone was joking when he was making his career suicide? the truth is that if i have to make a choice, i'd take william hung's debut cd over either one of these."
1,What was he thinking?,"Ok I can see singing some of these songs as swing, but come on, lyrics like load up on guns and bring your friends, just doesn't work for someone who is used to singing songs like teenager in love and put your head on my shoulder. Someone should have warned him that it didn't work for Pat Boone, it won't work for him either!!!!!!!!"
1,Oh my god!,"Oh my god! Smells Like Teen Spirit?!....Jump?!... oh my god! Wasn't there anyone with the balls to stop him, I mean oh my god! Are they kidding with this?!"
2,This is no longer novel. Too many albums of this genre already,"Steaming pile of poop. Pat Boone made me laugh. This is just sad. An old man trying to make his final $'s off of 20 & 30-somethings. Pathetic.Buying this album does not make you a ""hipster"" it just makes you sad.Save you money...if you must burn it from a friend.To give Mr. Anka his props, he did write My Way...it just took Frank to make it popular."
2,Novelty wears thin quickly,This is a gimmicky c.d designed to spark interest for people of all ages. Covers are from the 80's and 90's and represent some of the most popular songs of thier period but the novelty wears off quickly.
1,absolutely apalling,"Shame on Paul Anka for being disrespectful enough to make this record. By turning pensive and pain-driven songs like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", ""Black Hole Sun"", and ""Everybody Hurts"" into sappy, big-band, senior-citizen cruise tracks, Mr. Anka tries to grant himself a new lease on an already dead career. It is truly astonishing that a man who has so much experience in the music biz would disrespect these artists to such an extent. These time-honored tracks deserve better than that. Isn't there anyway that the original artists can demand the songs be destroyed forever?"
4,Looooved it!!,"In the era of the mp3s, its nice from time to time to buy a real CD. I chose to buy this since I think it has the best interpretations."
5,doing it his way,"decidely different than we've become accustomed to from Mr.Anka, but then he's always had the courage and tenacity to do it his way. Good for you Paul. And good for you for helping unearth the treasure you have found in Michael Buble. The two of you are making music more beautiful for all of us to enjoy."
3,Well Done!,"Before listening, it would be easy to dismiss this album as a novelty because it gives rock songs the Great-American-Songbook treatment. Long story short, the arrangements are generally orginal and very well done, and while Anka's vocals are not spectacular, he sounds comfortable and genuine in this setting. I'd pick this one over almost any of the new era of jazz singer's albums. Those albums tend to be full of the same old tunes: inferior versions of Sinatra-stamped standards with arrangements that heavily borrow (copy) from the original May, Riddle, etc. arrangements. Buy this and sing along."
2,What was he thinking?,"Anka must have made a bet with someone, that he could take the worst Rock, Punk and Grunge pieces of garbage and make them sound good by giving them big band arrangements. He lost that bet. He scores some hits with Lionel Richie's ""Hello"" and Clapton's ""Tears In Heaven,"" but some songs like Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" are so bad to begin with that no arrangement can save them. There are some good songs on this CD, but most should never have been touched. It's like Pat Boone's CD of heavy metal songs a few years ago. WShat was Anka thinking when he chose these songs?"
1,likes nails on a chalkboard....,"I heard this CD yesterday as I shopped in a local bookstore. It has a horrible MUSAC quality. Ugh! After ten minutes, I found it so annoying I left the store without buying anything. Paul, who talked you into this joke?This CD would make a great gag gift for someone who enjoys music (once it reaches Bargain prices). It can be used as a coaster."
1,One word: Travesty,"Paul Anka's attempt to cover Nirvana brings to mind a comment that Thom Yorke made upon seeing a sweater of the recently dead Kurt Cobain showcased under glass at a Hard Rock Cafe: ""the sickest f***ing thing I've ever seen."""
1,Oh dear God.,"I registered JUST to comment on this CD. This is horrible! I am a swing fan. I love Michael Buble. My friend told me about this, and I saw the first track was from my favorite band, Bon Jovi. (I'm going to be 17 on Saturday, and I have been a fan since I was about 13) This band means the world to me. Not to mention, I am a fan of the other rock bands he covered. I listened to It's My Life and it honestly felt like a slap in the face. Some of the other rewievs were VERY harsh to the grunge fans. I just felt like some of the reviews I heard went to far and were uncalled for. I personally didn't like any of the covers. I think this was a horrible idea for Paul Anka."
3,Where are the Gershwins when we need them???,"When I told my son about this CD he said, ""Just wait 'til you old people find out what some of these lyrics really are!"" And good grief, he was right. Some of the lyrics to these songs are unintentionally laugh-out-loud hilarious. However, the arrangements are simply spectacular. But then, I would expect no less from the guy who composed the Tonight Show Theme and My Way. I would pay again to get this CD as an instrumental. In fact, I might be willing to pay double the price. The music is just that terrific!"
5,Paul Anka - surprisingly my favourite album for ages!,"Words cannot describe just how oddly brilliant this CD really is...Here I am, in London in July 2005 in the middle of a heatwave and a bizarre transport situation caused by you-know-what - and listening to a truly excellent crooner belting out versions of ""modern standards"" with every bit of the skill, style and class of a Mel Torme or Bobby Darin in the 40s or 50s.I never had any time at all for dear old Paul - from his ""teenybopper"" roots through to the trashiness of his comeback in the 1970s he always was a bit of a joke.However I appreciate this album - as an example of how Paul's true vocal talent actually supersedes kitsch (as this whole album is likely to be interpreted by many) and actually does something special!"
4,Not a Novelty Album,"Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a jokey ""Weird Al"" kind of thing, it's actually a great album! I love Anka's interpretation of these modern rock songs (especially Wonderwall). Way to evolve, Paul Anka. Kudos to you."
5,Rock Swings,"This album is Great. It is not written by Paul but by other rock artists such as Clapton, Bon Jovi, Narvana, Linoel Richie and Michael Jackson. Paul has revised them and done them HIS WAY! and quite well I must say. A Necessity for a true ANKA Fan."
4,Just plain fun,"Listening to this album just puts a smile on your face. I don't think Anka's intention was to be ""serious"" about this. I think he is poking a little fun at the seriousness that rock muscians carry. This album is just plain happiness."
3,Why?,"I give this album three stars. Actually, if I could break it down into categories, the scoring would be different. For example, I'd give it a full five stars for arrangements. The three arrangers credited (none of whose names is familiar to me) did an absolutely fantastic job. The songs sound marvelous. Second, for vocal performance, I'd give Paul Anka four stars. (He sounds a little tired and lethargic on some tracks.) Finally, for material...two stars, maybe. I'm not a child of the 80s (unless perhaps the 1880s). To me, with one or two exceptions, these are thoroughly mediocre, unmemorable songs that weren't worth the talent and imagination that the arrangers put into them. They meander, they have false rhymes (like ""sound"" with ""town,"" which is just plain bad lyric writing), they don't have focus. But I'm told they were all big hits in the 80s, so what do I know?"
1,BEST COMEDY CD OF 2005,"AHAHAHAHHAHAHAH OH MY GOD ARE YOU KIDDING ME? LMAO WHAT A JOKE!! WHO WOULD ACTUALLY BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP?SERIOUSLY I CANT STOP LAUGHING! THE ONLY WAY I WOULD EVER BUY THIS CD WOULD BE FOR ITS COMEDIC VALUE- GRAB YOUR FRIENDS AND SIT AROUND AND LAUGH AT THIS CLOWN, IT WILL GIVE YOU 60 MINUTES OF ENJOYMENT THATS FOR SURE!!MUSICAL VALUE: F-COMEDY VALUE: B+NOW GO GRAB YOUR SACK OF GREEN TEA AND PLAY THESE SOUND CLIPS RIGHT NOW YOU WILL LAUGH YOUR @$$ OFF!"
1,Proof That God Does Not Exist,"Simply put, awful. Kurt Cobain is probably spinning in his grave fast enough to generate enough electricity to power downtown Seattle after hearing Smells Like Teen Spirit on this album. I felt like I was in a cheesy nightclub from the moment I put this CD in. A sacrilege from top to bottom."
1,Umm...,One must love Paul Anka and not Rock in order to like this cd. one must HATE rock. or maybe one must just find this cd funny to recommend it.why did you do it? now i can understand the words of kurt cobain! its just not natural!
1,Pathetic!,"This album is terrible; worse even than when Pat Boone did that metal thing. If you want to hear an emasculated, soulless version of Smells Like Teen Spirit, stripped of any actual content and shackled to a sanitized yet oh-so peppy beat, this might be the album for you. I actually had good hopes for this album, as I agree w/ his thesis that there're great songs out there that people'll never hear because they're in the wrong genre. My wife and I were horrified to discover though that instead he produced a hollow, vapid shell with nothing of note inside. It doesn't even swing!"
1,I think I'm gonna be sick....,"Hearing just the clips off amazon, i thought i was going to be sick. How could all these great musicians let this guy ruin their songs?? Kurt Cobain would shoot himself again, hearing this crap!"
4,Not a stanka - it's Paul Anka,"Well, I grew up listening to Paul Anka in the 70s (I still wish ""Listen to My Heart"" was re-released on CD, as well as the song"" everybody ought to be in love""), and I only know some of the original takes of the songs he covers on Rocks Swings. When I heard ""It's My Life"", I swear I thought Sinatra was reincarnated. It's great - and I like the original version of that. Some of the other songs echo Sinatra - there's nothing wrong with that. In some ways, this cd reminds me of Sinatra's duets albums -- and on this album Anka sings much much better than Sinatra in winter.Before you bash this as a unnecessary risk for Mr. Anka, let's remember: 1) Sinatra didn't write anything - he COVERED other writer's songs (and was very good at it); 2) Anka has always been an underrated singer; and 3) it don't mean a thing is it ain't got swing.So lighten up and keep an open mind listening to this."
4,Enjoy it as lounge swing or as a joke. Either one,"...But give credit to Anka for having the sense of humor and chutzpah to pull it off. Paul Anka singing Spandau Ballet, Billy Idol, Nirvana, Lionel Richie, Bon Jovi, REM, Soundgarden? What's not to like?I think it is cool that old-school Anka can find a way to embrace grunge!Most vocalists of Anka's generation would never touch this material with a 10-foot pole. But Anka (and his very talented music arrangers) know that one of the great things about great songs is that they can be re-interpreted countless different ways and still keep their musical integrity.This is absolutely worth listening to at least once or twice."
5,exelent add,thi is the perfect add for the xbox. the games came alive and the cuality of the sound is very impresive I totaly recommend this cable
5,Needed for the X-box Component cable Model XGL-400 to get digital audio,"This cable is for the x-box, not the x-box 360.If you get the Model XGL-400 component cable for the x-box, you notice that itXbox Component Video Cablestill doesn't have digital sound. The adapter hooks into it with a headphone-like jack and now gives a connection for a toshlink fiber optic cable. This monster cable fiber optic has the upgraded mesh jacket and matches the quality of the Model XGL-400 which is the best component cable available for the x-box."
5,Very special,"There's just no way I can express how special this movie touched my heart. I just loved it. I thought the end was very unique, too, how they took their first cd and put one of their songs in it. It was a very special song and I intend to get that cd as soon as I can. The same goes for their Life, Love, and other Mysteries book. Shelley, Heather, Terry, and Denise, I want you to know, if you look in this file, that I never want you to quit doing what you're doing now...touching the hearts of girls like me all over the world. Thank you!P.S. If you have the time, could you email me?"
5,Installation Make These Worth The Cost,"I have used a lot of f-pin coax cables in my lifetime, and none have been as easy to screw onto the connectors as these cables. You can really feel a quality difference. The screw-on ends are built well and do not hurt your fingers. No tools are needed to make sure the connection is screwed on tightly. The cables feel very thick, which seems in-line with the claims that they are shielded well.As for better picture quality, that is hard to measure, although my Comcast On-Demand seems to load a little quicker than before. You have to keep in mind though that the weakest link in your picture qulaity is the wires running from the outside of your home to your wall jacks. Adding a high-end coax cable probably won't help much in this regard.I liked them so much I bought extra for future TVs...because I like the screw-on ends better than any other coax cable I have used before."
2,Did not get the product described,"I ordered the Monster THXV100F8WHT but instead received an inferior cable the Monster SV100F-8 WHT. I already had opened the package before realizing I had the wrong cable in hand. Gathering from what I read about Amazon's return policy I could no longer return it due to already opening the package, however upon contacting them, Amazon refunded my purchase and issued a return label. So I am happy to report Amazon did their best to make things right. Hopefully anyone else ordering the THXV100F8WHT will get what they paid for. The cable I got appears to be Monsters bottom of the line."
1,Airhead fluff,"If in the near future aliens were to land on our planet...and if this was the first film they viewed, the human race would be in deep *&^%! This abomination is a clear testament that some films should never be released. With all of the great films out there that have yet to reach the DVD plateau, one wonders how this one elevated to that level. It truly sucks. The acting is an embarrassment to the industry. The script could have been written by my six-year-old granddaughter...and she would have embellished it much better. AVOID. One star is being extremely gracious. I bought this DVD for $1.99. At that, it was a total rip-off. I could have bought a box of Red Vines and watched the Nightly News."
1,"Useless if you have a brain,but a exceptional joke book.","The year 2000 crises was just a big rumor made by reporters to scare us so they could make money,it never happened,and since it is already 2002,this book is useless and should be taken off the market immediatly. I don't mean to insult anyone,but if you buy this book now,your a dummy. I would give it 0 stars if I could. It might make a good joke book,though."
5,ADORABLE,"My toddler is obsessed with all forms of transportation, so this book is perfect. It has a taxi, a backhoe, a firetruck, an ice cream truck, and more! Super simple text, beautiful and funny illustrations."
1,Pink-tone pages made it unbearable to read,"The color pages of alternating pink tones made this unreadable for me. I personally prefer black&white; text on white/beige ground.I didn't find the content that moving, but again it was hard to stay focused with the color scheme distracting me.Free group meditation at a Buddhist center and buying Thomas Farrand's Healing Mantras have been more helpful for me in finding inner peace.Thomas Ashley Farrand's Healing Mantras"
3,"Average advice, from a feminine perspective","I took a long shot at reading this book based on its reviews. The book offers alot of anecdotal advice, based heavily in common sense, and not much more. It also leans heavily toward the feminine perspective, so I gave it to my wife."
4,Found it helpful.,Chapters are short. Nice read before bed. Good and thoughtful information. Worth the money.
3,Everyday Ingredients for Healthy Cooking,"Good cookbook for someone looking to change the way they eat. The ingredients used are what many people would already find in their cupboards. I bought it for the George Foreman Grill recipes and was disappointed -- the only two recipes in the book specifically for the grill were already in the cookbood that came with the grill! Many of the recipes could be adapted for the grill, however, I was not looking to do that much work. Even though it didn't meet my need for purchasing it, this book was a good read and I'm looking forward to trying more of the recipes."
5,Perfectly Unbiased for the the Mormon and Non-Mormon Alike,"I read this book and loved it. Having a thirst for knowledge on the subject I have read several books on the subject ranging from both spectrums of ""Anti"" and ""church approved"" material.The authors of this book present the information in a very non biased, purely informational, manner. Yet they don't hold back anything. If you are mormon, this book will not cause you to forsake your religion like other ""anti"" books will. However, you will find yourself knowing more than 80% of mormons out there in terms of how the church is structured.If you aren't mormon you will find this to be a very modern and up to date source of information concerning the subject."
4,An interesting look at an amazing church,"Mormon America is a powerfully written book about the LDS Church and it's people. Most books about the Church are either written by Church Members proclaming the greatness of their Church or they are written by anti-mormons whose goals are to tear down the Church. Mormon America written by non-mormons, presents a very ""balanced"" view of the Church. Anyone interested in learning more about why the LDS Church is becoming a force on the world stage would do well to purchase this book."
2,misses the real day-to-day Mormon culture,"Mormon America is a gathering of facts that are already known. What is hoped for - an insight into the real culture - is sadly lacking. The Ostlings have chosen to speak with the ""in"" and ""out"" Mormons who are obvious choices. A much truer picture would emerge from in-depth interviews with members of the rank and file. Much has already been written and said about the heroes and pariahs of this denomination. Of much greater interest would be the insights of the real people who are the fabric of the church and have earned very strong opinions in favor of or against its policies. Lastly, the book is extremely repetitive and in need of substantial editing. Shame on Harper San Francsico!"
2,There's More Reading to Do,"The book is authored from the perspective of the `non-believer' in a kind of journalistic style. There is value in a perspective unaffected by personal and internal considerations, and the writer is able to offer some criticism that could not come unfettered from a Church member's pen.That said, describing a faith without a faith-based appreciation instills its own unavoidable bias, and that bias is apparent in the book - some veiled agenda such as is perhaps ever-present in `investigative journalism.' Further, an interpretation of the LDS Church with the presumption of humanistic origins is akin to describing the ocean minus the water. You're not going to get it right. Religion is about the divine. Subtract that, and whatever you have left is something other than religion.So, while the book makes a contribution, it falls far short of its 'full truth'claims. If a reader hopes to know something closer to the full story about ""Mormonism,"" they have some more reading to do."
3,Mormon in America,"The book was full of pertinent facts, but very repetitious. One was left With the impression that the authors had compiled a series of essays for publication in book form."
5,Great resource,"What I like best about this book is that the author goes out of his way to try to avoid bias. This is the only thorough book on the subject that I have found that I feel like is unbiased. I checked this out at the library first, and after I finished reading it, I decided to buy it, because it is good reference material. I would highly recommend this book."
3,Well....,"I myself have done intense research into the church. I myself am a practicing Roman Catholic. I think most everything written in this book was very well done. Although, I'd have to disagree on ""cultish secrecy""... I suppose it depends on how you define ""cult"".. It's not secrecy. Especially if it is known by the non-LDS public. I think that the foundation of the church is strong and any religion is debatable. There is proof against it and proof towards it. It's what you believe, I like how this book avoided saying ""Mormonism is WRONG!"".. There are many books out there that should really think about what God wants us to be.. Rather then writing criticism and hatred towards another religion. I highly recommend this book, but also read some others before hand so you get a feel for the religion."
2,Not as balanced as it pretends to be,"Don't let the jacket text fool you. This is not the unbiased, balanced work it purports to be. To cite just one of several examples: when a chapter on the Book of Mormon consists almost exclusively in a detailed recitation of the arguments of Book of Mormon critics, and only provides one (vague) paragraph describing the pro-Book of Mormon scholarship done by authors like Nibley and Welch, you know the author has his own agenda, even if the publisher won't admit it. This book is anti-mormonism with a (falsely) friendly face."

2,Kindle formatting is horrible,Someone needs to fix the formatting on the Kindle version. The illustrations are there but for half of the book it doesn't look right. Not worth the $3.99.
3,"An Okay Reader That Doesn't Talk Down To Beginners - a review Of ""Cat Traps""","The ""Early Step into Reading Books"" are meant for the earliest readers (preschoolers and kindergarteners). And unlike some other Series and books that make this claim, this book really is at the appropriate level for true beginners. The word choice is simple and the text is printed in a large font. An example follows:Cat wants a snack.Cat sets a trap.Cat gets a pig.Too big!As others have noted the story line is pretty cute and the artwork is bright and attractive. There are also `notes' for parents or other caregivers that give hints as to what to do to help the beginning reader to step into reading.Three Stars. A cute book suitable for real beginning readers, that does not talk-down to them. Affordable price."
1,The Kindle version of this book was a huge disappointment.,"The Kindle edition of this book was a huge disappointment for me. It was my first purchase for my daughter, in the kids book section. Some pages are blank, some just have words, they do not line up well at all. I will be sticking to free books from Gutenburg or PDF's for the kids."
5,Cute book with fun clues,"I was introduced to this book by a young girl I was babysitting. She is six years old and loves the book. She can read it all by herself, which is important to build confidence.One thing we enjoyed was that each time Cat sets a trap, the reader is given a clue about what he might catch. She pointed out each clue and giggled.As an adult, it is easy to become bored or frustrated by a book that is too contrite; however, I thought this was a cute, enjoyable book."
2,Poor Kindle Formatting,"This is a fun book, but it unfortunately loses a lot of it's charm on the Kindle.The first several pages are not part of the book, so the Kindle sample doesn't provide any hint to the poor formatting.After buying the book one finds that on the Kindle reader (not DX) the pages seem to be very inconsistently laid out. Sometimes the picture takes only the top half of the screen, sometimes there is a picture with no text followed by a page with a single three word sentence. Font sizes are erratic, pagination is wonky.The situation is slightly better on the iPad, but it is still clears that whomever was responsible for putting this in Kindle format did a terrible job of it. Even a cursory review makes it clear that the books formatting is completely unacceptable.tl;dr: broken, don't buy."
5,Wonderful reference tool,"This book is a handy resource for help with finding meanings of words without a dictionary. It is thorough, and a must for anyone interested in the deconstruction of words and/or etymology. I highly recomend this book, I find myself reading it aimlessly, like the phone book."
4,Good race game with extra violence,This is a great game for 2 players either working together or against each other. One person drive a chariot the other tries to kill off the other oppenents. Ripped from the center of Rome circa 100 AD and brought to you in the comfort of your living room. Its a real hoot. Not quite as much fun by yourself.
3,Nicky flores Circus Maximus Review,"Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars - As the FIRST and ONLY game to combine the classic themes of chariot racing and gladiator fighting, Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars brings the raw excitement of survival racing to the majestic coliseums and arenas of the Roman Empire. There is no other game like it!Circus Maximus infoPublished byEncoreDeveloped byKodiak InteractiveStreet DateFebruary 2002GenreRacingPlayers1-4RatingTeenFeaturesSimultaneous control of driver and warrior or let the A.I. drive while you fightUp to four players set up two-man teams for unparalleled co-op racing and fighting action22 unique characters with individual featuresSeven beautiful Roman landscapes with 19 tracksMultiple race modes (Arcade, Multiplayer, Tournament and Training)Over a hundred of driver, warrior, horse and chariot combinationsUpgrade and unlock new options as you win races"
5,This game rules(only on the best system Xbox),This game is non stop action. Kicks a**. As your riding down in circus maximus theirs always danger and non-stop action. This is a must buy and remember xbox is the best.
4,Good game,"Heard so many neagative reviews of this game before it's release that I was really expecting it to be awful, but to my surprise it really is quite fun to play."
2,Probably not worth your money.....,"Just to let you know i'm 15. I bought Circus Maximus thinking it would be the cool because it was kinda different looking. I must say I'm impressed with the graphics but as far as overall fun goes, it's another story. If you become an expert on the controls in a few hours like I did, you get ahead of everyone else and YOU DO NOTHING BUT DRIVE! And when you do fight there's nothing exciting about it for long.Pros:Great GraphicsGood soundControls could be a challange (for once)Multiplayer mode is almost better than single playerCrashes can be interestingCons:If your good, the whole game will just get boring!Not too many tracksVery limited gameplaySo far the Xbox has no impressive games as far as overall fun goes. I've never played HALO and I heard it was the best. We'll see, as for this game, SATISFACTION NOT GUARANTEED!"
2,1.75 thumbs down,"I thought this game stank on ice. I wouldn't spend good money on this game. The game is too simple, too cartoonish, too boring. There are some times that it was amusing, but not enough to justify spending money. I found myself returning the game the same day I rented it. This game should have been released for the PS1."
1,Waste of Money,Keeping it simple I will jsut say that the game play is repetative with little action adn poor controls. Consider a racing game on the atari 2600 system instead. I only wish I didnt lose my reciept so I could return it.
2,Not worth it,"I rented this, hearing all the hype for it, and was sorely, sorely disappointed (as I was with most of my XBox games). I didn't like the gameplay, I didn't like the sound, I didn't like the story. (?)I almost regret the [price] I payed to rent this game, so I wouldn't even consider buying it...But of course, that's just me."
5,Che in the Congo,"The African Dream is a great book for people interested to learn what happened during the first of Che's 2 ""lost years."" In April, 1965, Che left Cuba, not to be seen again until his murder in Bolivia in October of 1967. Che first tried to bring about revolution in the Congo, which was undergoing the beginning of the Apartheid government that was to take the lives of millions of innocent Africans in the coming years. In Che's own words, you will gain massive insight into what went on during that nearly year long struggle for freedom and justice."
3,The Liberal Icon???,"President Obama's ""Che"" seems to feel our president's African lineage is a disability. As in one of the other reviews, this tome reads like a comedy and slaps the collective, ""pun intended,"" faces of liberals, socialists, Marxists and revolutionaries et.al. every where. Their hero it turns out discovered something that looking at present day Africa proves. Decide for yourselves what that actually is after you read this book. Equality for all and power to the people? I think not according to the left's beloved Che. As with everything liberal / socialist, hypocrisy seethes from this latter day hero of the ""masses."" I will say this though, the truth will set you free and if you dare, a conversation about race dot com. Bottom line... funny read.""I am shocked! Absolutely shocked! heh heh..."""
3,Imperfect But Still Entertaining,"In Manhattan, two theatre companies, one avant-garde, one traditional, are putting on productions of the same long lost play by Jane Austen.The actors, directors, angels, techies and hangers on of both groups all seem to know each other, and complications, romantic and otherwise,ensue. Also, at severalpoints, the plot of Austen's play becomes real and you see dramatic events unfolding in a wild landscape.The storytelling here is rather a mess, and much of the acting, especially by the younger performers, is weak.Anne Baxter delivers some of her lines in a wonderfully acid tone. Of the younger group, only Sean Young went on to have a major career. Although she is very beautiful here,there is little indication of the skills, both comedic and serious she would reveal in later years.Marginally a comedy, there are few laughs to be had.If you love lower Manhattan, you will enjoy looking at this, but it is certainly the weakest film in the Merchant-Ivory catalog."
1,What a Dissapointment!,"The blurb about this movie made it seem like something I wanted to see, even buy. I rented it yesterday. Thank goodness I did not buy it! It is bizarre' to say the least, and lousy, to say the truth! My husband is a former film maker and even he found nothing good to say about the technique, script, lighting, acting, et al. The whole thing has almost nothing to do with Jane Austen-a lost piece of her work sold at auction to the leader of misguided would-be actors in New York under his spell. He passes himself off as some sort of avant-garde coach, when he is actually creating some kind of cult in which he alone reaps any benefits. He takes everyone's money, practically holds them prisioner, and puts on ridiculous scenes in the name of creating genius. Only Anne Baxter added anything positive to this film as an actress who wants to put on a real production of the Jane Austen works, but even she can not pull this stinker out of the loo. Save your money and your time."
1,The Worst,"This is the worst Jane Austen adaption, it was based on one of her unknown pieces from her childhood. A young woman is kidnapped by a man who wants to force her to marry him so he can gain control over her fortune. Her story made more sense than this one. Ex lovers and enemies try to get the rights to the play, the man wants to do an extremely modern version and it is horrible. They tried and failed to make a direct correlation between Jane's play and the director stealing another actor's girlfriend. The acting was bad too, the only good parts were the segments of Jane's actually play, but they didn't do the entire play and never showed how it ended and it was not enough to redeem this terrible film."
1,What the...,"This was the worst movie that ever had the audacity to put the name of Jane Austen in the title. I may know little about film but this one is to be avoided!I'm a big Jane Austen fan and when I saw something with her name in the title I ignored all the reviews to see it myself. Save yourself the trouble and don't make the same mistake!One word to sum it up, bleh!"
5,PC Case,"This ATX case is great. I am a photographer and needed a large storage case for multiple hard drives and this one fits the package. It allows me to have 2 DVD/CD drives and more at the top and inside there are 5 retractable bays that I can put the HD in and if necessary easily pull out any one drive. There are places for additional cooling fans in the front and rear ( I recommend those if you use all the bays). The power supply is adequate, the side panel is easy to open, the front panel supports USB and Firewire slots, headphones etc.Over all this is a great case."
5,I tought this dvd will never come,"As Chespirito's fan I been waiting so long for a documental like this. Never seen before footage (about his life, childhood, first steps in trajectory. Language: Spanish, no subtitles (sorry for don't spanish readers). Great Menu. Interviews with Florinda Mesa and Edgar Vivar. Curiosities about Chavo del 8. Good quality.Other Chespirito's face is exposed in this dvd, experiences from the past, the start of his revolutionaries personages. Do you want to know about the life of Roberto Gomez, his two wifes, first job, etc? Buy this dvd. Excellent piece for fan's personal collection and public in general."
4,The best documentary of Chespirito I've ever seen,"It has a very detailed coverage of Roberto's life as a child. With never seen before pictures & footage, including bits of ""Los Supergenios de la mesa cuadrada"", behind the scenes while recording ""El Chapulin"", ect.Reniet (chespirito.org)"
2,Does Not Support Windows 7,Please note this is a reveiew of the bundle not just the tape drive.According to the Quantum web site [...] they are bundling Backup Exec 8 Quick Start Edition which will not install on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2. It is my understanding that it will not install on Vista either. The bundled software is obsolete.If you are using Windows 7 or Vista you would be better off building just the drive without the bundled software as it is significantly less expensive.
4,Handheld fighting perfection... almost.,"The graphics, amount of characters and special moves, amount of fighting options, and sheer quality of this fighting game is borderline crazy. You get so much for a portable game thats two inches square.Having Street Fighter with over 30 characters for on the go is awesome. You cant ask for anything more... well you kind of could.The only thing that stinks in this game, and its a big stinker, is the control. On a console controller or in the arcade i could bust out 50 fireballs in a row without a sweat. This game is a different story. The small size of the GBA/DS makes performing these special moves extremely tough. After 10 minutes of this game i feel like i need Bengay or some cream from the arthritis that this game is giving my fingers and hands. ;)All in all this is a terrific title for short periods of time even though the control of some of the moves are painful to pull off."
3,Street Fighter In The Palm Of Your Hands,Street Fighter Alpha 3 is one of the best in the series but this port lacks its full potential because of its difficult controls. If only the game boy advance had 6 buttons instead of 4 this would be true to the arcade. It may take awhile before I can get use to these controls but so far its a great game.
3,Good translation ruined by controls,"I'll keep this brief: If you want Street Fighter on the GBA, buy Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo Revival. That game handles the fact that the GBA only has 4 buttons by letting you assign punches and kicks to brief-vs-long button presses. It's not ideal, but it works. Alpha 3 doesn't even give you this option, instead it forces you to assign them to combinations of the triggers and the A&B buttons. Try throwing a fireball with L+B. It just doesn't work. I partially blame Nintendo for refusing to give a portable more than 2 face buttons, but I mainly blame Capcom for not giving you the brief-vs-long button assignment options."
2,Slashed and burned,"First of all, any game with Cammy in it is worth having. But it's a real shame that all the great storylines from the original version were almost entirely cut out. I was hoping for more (not less!) after Capcom created new storylines for SSF2TR. And some of the best stages were nixed too. The graphics are good, and the gameplay is okay once you get used to the awkward button scheme. The 3 new characters make it kinda interesting, but that wasn't enough to make-up for all that was lost."
5,Looks Cool,I have no doubt that this will be an awesome game. I've seen screenshots & read reviews about it in Game Pro & EGM. The graphics are about GBA'S best they look like the psx's graphics witch is good for a handheld. Gamepro said it was extremely fun and a must but for GBA owners and fighting junkies.
1,horrible,this game is a waste of breath jeff the fighter is dum u cant even make a pie in china times eggs.
4,A reason why Capcom's brilliant,"Street Fighter Alpha 3 is a perfect addition to a GBA collection. If you can get past the painful setup for controls, you'll be fine. Plus Yun, Maki, and Eagle made it from Capcom vs. SNK 2 in the same forms!! This is perfectly the best fighter for any handheld. Don't be a baby just because you [can't master]the moves. Ain't my problem"
3,Reader from Israel,"Not a bad book , however it picks and chooses its fights much to my disappointment . The book of Revelation itself could fill a volume of this side but unfortunately it is skimmed through vastly much to my surprise."
3,Hard sayings,"The book arrived in good time, but the book itself was only worth taking it out back and filling it full of bullet holes. Very incorrect, as compared to the Bible."
2,"Good overview, but many hard sayings unfairly simplified","Overall, a well researched volume which maintains a high regard for scripture. I appreciated many of the insights offered, particularly the treatment of many of the difficult passages in the Old Testament. However, I do have a serious complaint. The book seems to trivialize a number of hard teachings in the Bible either by skirting around the issue, or by interpreting them in such a way as to remove any possible offense, thus making them easy for anyone to accept. For example, whether or not you believe in predestination, the serious reader will find it somewhat suspect that the book deals with the entire issue by demonstrating how one particular passage really does not address predestination at all, then refering back to the commentary on that passage every time the issue reemerges."
4,Watchable,"This movie contains almost a child like view of the world. The Americans are somewhat all knowing and wise while the British are naive. It is almost as if the British have done a total reverse of their post ww2 view that the British felt that they were the smart ones in the relationship. It cast doubts as to whether there is a special relationship between Britain and the US, and it also contains the view that Tony Blair was not a progressive which the films sees as a criticism of him.The filming itself was good. There were times, I was stunned how seamlessly, the movie was able to merge the movie into historical films. I also thought that Dennis Quaid played very well."
4,... much to his misfortune,"A small but sparkling gem about friendship and power, very well cast and acted. Chronicles the genuine affection, misunderstandings and clashes between President Bill Clinton and British PM Tony Blair, and how their warm personal relationship led Blair to consider Bush II in the same light... much to his misfortune. If you need explosions skip it, but if you enjoy movies about our actual life then check it out!"
3,okay,"I enjoy political movies but this just did not interest me that much. I would not buy it again, nor watch it again."
2,The Special Relationship,Movie was informative & I liked it. Did not like ordering a new DVD & charged new DVD price and received a previously reviewed DVD from a library.
1,could have been better...,i really think this game should never have touched my gamecube. i rented it and returned the next day. the graphics were N64 and it was not in an even slightly free roaming environment. crazy taxi is way way better even if u hate it. This game ..[is no good] and that's final.
2,My 3 Year Old Loves it,We got this game for our sons 3rd birthday thinking he could watch us play (he loves watching us play games) and thinking he could play once in awhile...well when we got it I sat down for an hour and finished the game...hubby has played a couple times and doesn't like it...but our son loves to sit down and play...he so close to finishing the game...so I have to say Great for 3 year olds...beyond boring for anyone older and the music is sooo annoying.
3,THAT SONG WOULD ANNOY THE HEARING IMPAIRED,"THIS GAME IS NOT WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR. BUT IT'S NOT A TOTAL LOSS EITHER. ARCADE FANS WILL LOVE IT. IT'S FUNNY HOW N64 PUSHED SO MANY GREAT RACING TITLES, BUT SOME HOW THERE IS SO FEW ON GAMECUBE. BE PATIENT THE BEST RACING GAMES YOU'LL EVER PLAY WILL ARRIVE ON GAMECUBE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. F-ZERO WHERE ARE YOU?"
1,This game sucks it desirves a negative star,This game looks like it could be on the original playstation itsgot a stupid plot and is going to be a waste of money.
4,Doesn't weigh hair down yet doesn't lift it that much either!,"I am not sure how to feel about this product . It doesn't make your hair sticky or unnatural and doesn't weigh it down either however, i don't feel much lift neither .. well, maybe it gives hair volume yet the effect is not dramatic. One thing I can say for this product that whenever I use it I get compliments about my hair style I guess it helps hair maintain form and bounce and maybe some volume ..Last time I used it , I noticed that my hair developed dandruff , so don't put too much near the roots.."
3,read Blau instead,"This is a crucial text in the history of exchange theory. If you already know something about exchange theory then you won't learn much by reading it. It's nice to see the foundations, though."
2,Loud and odoriferous,"This air purifier is good looking and mobile on it's casters but quite large. It's loud on the settings you would use if you have air problems like pet dander, light tobacco smoke, car exhaust, etc. I run it on MAX while at work and lower it while at home. I bought the 601 with the optional Smokestop filters and it has decreased residual smoke odors from my downstairs neighbors but with a twist...the machine (with these filters at least) gives off an odd and unpleasant odor of its own. I'm told the smell is harmless and should pass after a while but I've read of this issue in a number of online reviews so I doubt that it is just my unit. I am on the fence about keeping the 601 and am exploring other air purifiers in the mean time."
4,Great for workingin the attic,"We wear this in the attic to protect us from roofing nails and beams. It is a bit loose, but it works."
2,"No Occipital Strap, so Comes Off Head Easily","Compared to my MSA bump cap, this ERB bump cap has no occipital strap (a strap that rides under the protrusion at the back of the skull). That means it relies on tightness around the circumference of the head alone, to stay on. Knocks off more easily than a baseball cap. Just not secure enough."
1,Rimsky-Korsakov discs.,"Rimsky is a favorite composer. It's good to hear this diverse collection of his work conducted by Neeme Jarvi, an first-class conductorFrances VandervoortChicago"
4,Valuable reference,"This graduate-level book is crammed with information about marine geology. Plenty of diagrams and charts assist in the visualization of sometimes difficult concepts. The book's only real flaws are that it is a bit out of date (15 years) and that the editing is a bit dense - every couple pages one runs across extremely abstruse phrasing or grammatical errors. The information itself, however, is indispensable. There aren't any real alternatives to this book if you are studying geological oceanography or are merely interested in post-introductory texts on the subject."
3,Some good tracks that are pretty hard to find,"The Beck track is great to listen to, since it is impossible to find anywhere else."
5,Excellent first readers to motivate children to read,"I purchased these books for my 5-year-old daughter who is beginning to read on her own and these Step Into Reading books are excellent as they have a high-interest factor that motivates her to read. The stories are also wonderfully illustrated in full color. Here, the book is about sunshine,""Sun shines on the mountains. Sun shines on the sea"" and moon shine, ""Moon shines on the houses. Moon shines on the cars.""These Step 1 series are recommended for preschool-K - the stories are in large type and the vocabulary is easy. The stories are also in a rhyming format which makes them easy and fun to read. The full color pictures also provide contextual clues as to the word being used in the text. These early readers have raised my daughter's confidence level in reading, and she is doing so well that I'm purchasing the Step Two books (Preschool-Grade 1). I use these books in conjunction with sight words to reinforce her recognition of common vocabulary."
5,Excellent for learning.,"I bought this book to help my daughter learn how to read, and from all those targeted for this purpose this one has been the winner for sure. She can now read it from cover to cover, a first. The illustrations help a lot, and the way repetition and introduction of new words is weaved into the story is awesome. Recommend it fully, and I am looking forward to getting others in this series."
1,Vender failed to point out that film was 7 years expired!!!!,"When I used the film, the photos were so cloudy, the objects were hard to discern. I suppose if they had mentioned that it was 7 years expired, they would never have sold it, but then THAT'S THE POINT!!!! YOU SHOULDN'T SELL PRODUCTS THAT YOU KNOW ARE FAULTY!!! SHAME ON YOU."
1,No so good,The order shipped fast.. the product was crap. the box said 05/05 and then someone scratched in 17 so it looked like 05/05/17 pictures were orange cloudy and the corners were cromeI paid 80$$$$$!!!
4,Photo Fan,Daughter is into old fashion instant photos and she wanted this film to use her old poloroid camara. we hope it works good for her.
1,Polorod film,This was a rip-off. I expected a sealed package with two packets of film.What I got was onepacket unsealed. I wont buy again this product on line.
1,"Incredibly overpriced, doesn't work","The film expired in 2009, but I figured that it would at least work a little bit, so I bought two packs of it, for about a hundred dollars, a little over. I bought it as a gift for someone, but they were incredibly disappointed by it because none of the 20 pictures came out. Save yourself the grief and money and buy Impossible 600 film instead for about half the cost."
1,very upset,I paid a lot of money for this film and it doesn't even work!! I got 3 pictures out of it and they barely developed...the rest of the film came out all messed up. Upset does not even describe how I am feeling.
5,Instant Print,"Purchased a vintage Polaroid that used 600 instant color. Hard to find item and glad that product performed as expected on vintage camera,"
2,Polaroid,"I received the film on time , and the packaging way new , however the film did not work. I don't know if this is the dealers fault or polaroids fault."
1,Don't buy,The film was old and the photos were terrible! This used to be a really easy way to document something.
2,OLD film only,"I received a box of film that expired in 2004. This is 2011, by the way. I realize this product is no longer made, but I expected better than some sketchy 7-years-expired box from the Netherlands."
5,bring it back!,"first off, the vendor is great. they sent my film to me very quickly.i love polaroids, i always have and it makes me so sad that they have been discontinued. they give pictures something extra. pretty much everyone looks better in a polaroid. the picture is bright and not so clear that every flaw is shown. they are so nostalgic and they capture life's most important memories instantly."
3,Polaroid 600 film,"kind of expensive, but I still want to use my camera, it's the best price at Amazon and the safest."
1,Do not buy it,Do not buy it:1. This ad was misleading because this picture of polaroid 600 film item did not match what I ordered.2. I think that description of item was not enough accuracay beause expiration date.3. This is suck.
5,Instant Film-Polaroid,Just what we ordered and the product was received quickly. We would recommend this product and vendor to others looking for Polaroid Film.
1,this film is bad.,"The polaroid film i recieved is no good,It turned orange and the corners have bad spots. Every picture i took turned out bad."
2,Polaroid,I finally got the film after a little less than a month of ordering it. I have take 3 pictures so far and they are all way too light. I love polaroids and was so excited to use it but am very disappointed in the quality of the film. It seems as though it is really old or something I'm not sure.
2,not very pleased with film,i purchased film in the past and have been very happy. for some reason this time wasn't good. the film they gave me was very poor. i feel i wasted my money and will not do business with this vendor again. regrets jamie
1,Don't bother!!,"This is a great concept and was delighted when I learned that I could get the Polaroid One Step camera. However, as of 2009 (next week!) the film will be discontinued. What good is the camera if you cannot get the film?I returned everything! Very disappointing as this was a gift for my husband for his birthday. O well."
4,Polaroid 600 fillm,"The product arrived on time and without any damage. I purchased the film for my daughter's birthday party. We decorated frames and I took a photo of each girl. The kids thought that watching the picture develop before their eyes was awesome! It was amazing to see their reaction to the old-time technology and how I explained that this was what we had before we had home computers and printers. I have a fairly new polaroid camera as polaroid go (10 years old) and I was a little disappointed with the faded photos that the film produced. I compared the images with photos that I had taken 10 years ago and the new photos were a bit more faded. I do have to say that the photos are in focus and are still worth saving. I suppose this is what happens with old film and if you are expecting brightly colored photos this is not for you because the photos averaged around $2 a piece. Otherwise, take your kids on a fabulous journey and and pay the little extra for the flashback!"
2,Disappointing,"The first four pictures came out, but unfortunately the battery (in the film) died before I could use all ten...I suppose it's the risk you take when buying (old, albeit un-used) polaroid film."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"Well, I gave it a shot, but I think it's best to stick to photo programs that mimic polaroids because the real deal is so temperamental these days. The film must have been around a long time before I bought it. Once they ""developed"" they had weird splotches of mustard brown and tiny hints of a developed picture hidden in a few shots. I appreciate the cheap price though! :)"
1,Polaroid Film,"The film arrived promptly. However, it was no good. I could get an image but no color. The comapny asked me to return it. I did. They will either replace it or refund my money."
1,Completely disappointed w/ product,The film did not work. If anyone does try to buy this film please keep the box and mailing label because you will probably have to return. Amazon was very gracious in accepting my return and returning my money.
1,old film package,"The delivery was on time and the outside package was ok, but the film was manufactured in 2004, so it didn't reveal well and there was a stain in the upper corner that remained dark in all pictures taken."
2,expired,"this film arrived quickly and fit the camera just fine. however, even though the expiration date said 2009, the film had clearly been tainted in some other way, left out in heat or cold, or something, because the color was very poor and the pictures never really fully developed, maintaining a fuzzy, orange-ish color. Hopefully it was only this batch, but as the film has gotten so expensive and difficult to find, I won't be able to afford risking it again with this provider."
4,New Film Manufactured,"A group of investors has leased the Polaroid process, building and equipment for 10 years to develop a new film for old Polaroids. They call it the ""Impossible Project"" group. I saw the article today dated 03/23/09. Good news for those of us who have held onto them. http://www.the-impossible-project.com/"
1,Polaroid 600 Film,Do NOT buy this film from ANYONE! Polaroid has NOT manufactured this film or the camnera in over two years! The battery is in the film and has a shelf life of approximately one to two years (less if not properly stored!). The camera and the film are obsolete! Don't waste your money or time!!! I unfortunately found this out too late!
1,Secretary,I didn't think the product was worth the price. I have used this before and it worked perfect but this time the black cardboard didn't release in either pack and the 1st picture of each was ruined so therefore instead of getting 20 pictures only 18 were ok.This certainly was not worth the money if you don't get all the pictures.
3,Poloroid film order,"These poloroid films came quickly, which was veryconvenient, but I was disappointed to see that theexpiration date on the film was already passed...I decided to use it anyway and the pictures werefine, gladly, since I ordered the film to takefirst-day pictures of my students. I won't beordering from this vendor again because I can'ttrust that the film won't be expired already..."
4,Polaroid 600 Film,"The film was shipped with a disclaimer stating that the quality of the product may be compromised due to its age, but in fact, it's performance was highly satisfactory."
3,Love the pics,Its great for the convenience especially if youre like me and you dont want to wait for developing time however if you are travelling I would suggest a 35 mm cam instead because pictures could get ruined in packing and I find the picture quality to be a little dark As opposed to some 35mm that have a clearer brighter picture quality.
1,Terrible,I never got the film so I can't tell you how I liked it and therefore haven't used the camera because I never got film. Terrible job guys
1,Beer advertisements on film!!,"I bought a vintage polaroid camera that takes this film, and was so excited to try it, until I see the film when it comes out of my camera...it has a Budweiser beer ad on it!It says Budweiser, and budweiser.com on the bottom of my film, and all around it it's blue and white. Naturally, I was very, very disappointed to see this, because polaroid pictures should be white around the edges, and you should be able to write on them.No reviews or anything said this, and nothing on the packaging mentions these ads.I DIDN'T GET THIS ON AMAZON, BUT AMAZON GUIDED ME TO THE WEBSITE.Besides the horrible ad, the film quality is pretty good, and the packaging was unopened. I don't think every film package has this, but just know that some do! I'm in the process of making paper frames to cover up the beer ad, because who wants their pictures to have a giant blue BUDWEISER ad on it. Hope this helps."
1,poor expiration date,Expiration date was 8/09. In the past the expiration date was usually 1 year forward not 2 months forward
1,"Expired Film, beware!","Just bought some film a few weeks ago & just tried to shoot some images today. Every image except one did not develop properly in the pack, the emulsion was dried up already. The expiration date said 5/09, which means it shouldn't have dried up so quickly unless they were not properly stored. I bought a lot of film too, I'm afraid the other packs will be just as bad. :( I haven't had problems like this in the past with polaroids I've bought (I love polaroids), so I'm thinking these weren't cared for or refrigerated."
1,I was excited.,"I understand that no one uses this film anymore, but fifty bucks for sepia pictures? I could make those pictures for free on my phone."
1,The film had expired two years ago,"I bought this for a friend of mine in France. She informed me that the package had an expiration date of two years ago. She has not used it, so I don't know how good they are, but for the price you pay the least they can do is send you a product that has not expired yet."
5,polaroid film,Just what I was looking for and didn't think I would find it - great packing and prompt shipping
1,Terrible polaroid purchse,"This item was terrible. Ill never buy here again. My film was all whited out and was labeled ""Jekel and Hyde"" on the developed film."
2,Ruined film,"The film's worth, as it was, was questionable, just due to its high price. But it was a gift for my boyfriend, a photography enthusiast, so I figured it was worth the splurge. He unwrapped it and loaded his (also new) camera and everything seemed fine until he took his first shot (which he was hesitant to do, as there are only ten pictures to spend). The upper corners of the photo were ruined. And upon taking a second photo some days later, we learned the whole pack must be ruined. It looks kind of cool and it's not too big of a deal because we both appreciate photo accidents, but it wasn't worth $60. Maybe the store should check where it stores their packs or check its source."
1,Poloroid Film 600,I haven't tried using the film yet however I'm very dis satisfied with how I received the item as the package was torn etc so I'm not comfortable as to whether it will operate and the price was very high so I'd never purchase another
1,Polaroid 600 Film,"I wasn't pleased with this product at all. A total waste of my money and time ordering and waiting for it to arrive. The film was outdated, and did not work properly."
3,Polaroid 600 Film Single Pack,"I bought one pack to try it out, even after reading a few other reviews saying that the film doesn't develop all the way..... And true to some of the reviews-it doesn't. My photos all stop developing once they reach an orange/yellow-ish color (and it's not the nice antiquey kinda orange that some people might kinda want their photos to have). I'm guessing they're all just old packages for sale now or something since polaroid doesn't make new film anymore. I bought a second one which I'm waiting to receive right now despite what happened with the first. I'm kinda hoping the second one isn't the same but I expect so. I somewhat recommend this because it's nice to actually have polaroid film again for the first time in a really, REALLY long time. But I also suggest that if you do buy it don't expect it to develop all the way. I read good and bad reviews on this product, so I expected both. Hope this helped some."
2,Exp date was 2007!,"I just received the film in a timely manor and was excited as my niece just told me she still had the polaroid camera I had bought many years ago. She said she looked for the film and couldn't find. I jumped onto amazon and sure enough there it was. I bought a pack (even though the price was crazy HIGH) but hey it was for my niece BUT the experation date is 2007 so I think I will just return it after reading the reviews as to others who used the expired film and it was bad.. Not worth paying over $50 for..I have a compact HP A646 printer for my digital prints and it's GREAT.. I like to be able to view a picture before printing. between the ink and photo paper it's about 30 cents a print and soooo easy.. Also small enough to take with you anywhere.. No computer is necessary, you just need an outlet to plug it in.. and within about 1 minute your photo is printed.."
3,"Fine for your old Polaroid, but kind of overpriced","This is good film if you have a camera that requires Polaroid 600 film, but when it comes down to numbers, you're paying five bucks per shot which is a pretty penny. The film is good quality - or as good as you can get, but then again, I shouldn't complain. If I find myself whining about the quality, I'll just use my digital camera."
2,Not satisfied,"This story is dull, and it goes on for too long without anything interesting happening. My students were quickly bored with it; I feel I wasted my money on this one."
5,Unique fiction.,"J.Scott, what a unique Author in the CBA.Jefferson Scott combines real Christians from professional backgrounds and places them into situations that reflect real issues of the day.It is relevant, and hard hitting with romance and Warfare all in between. Sad that he intends to do no more with Jason and the crew.Look for subtle one liners that reflect his desire to be relevant to the culture of the day also.Read it if you liked the A-team,any cool 80's sitcoms or just gutsy fiction with a biographical touch that inspires you to better yourself and use that to help others in their need by going beyond our own limitations.GS."
1,5 minute ball,"My dog played with this ball for 5 minutes before the squeaker piece dislodged. needless to say, it went straight in the trash before she choked on it."
2,disappointed,This was offered with another product. I ordered both. The other was vastly superior. The Petco product was junk. Even the dog prefers the other one.
1,This Book stinks,"I picked up this book at the public library thinking that it would be a great book but boy was I wrong. this book is so horrible that I couldn't get past the first chapter without getting board. Did I mention that this book is very confusing also? well it is. So if u like long, boring books that put you to sleep, then this is your book, if not then stay away!!!"
3,alright for the price,"This is an airsoft sniper rifle that shoots around 370-400 fps with .2g bb. I didn't buy off amazon but i have the exact same gun. It shoots very powerfly and has good consistency. It is uncomfortable to use the open sights. The bipod, red dot scope and extra barrel are all useless. The silencer looks great but does nothing. I don't think anyone under 14 would be strong enough to pull the spring back (some may). Generally if you put a scope on it and get it sighted in it is good enough for a $50 gun. Don't get me wrong gun is great, but buy for the gun and not the accesories or you'll be disapointed."
1,"Great novel, horrible ebook...","The formatting on the Kindle version is horrible. There is no true cover, only a title page. There is no table of contents. There isn't a single indented paragraph in the whole book and no spaces between any of the paragraphs. Scene change spaces? Forget about 'em because they don't exist here. Basically, each chapter looks like one long, giant paragraph. It's extremely hard to read in it's current form. I'm assuming this is more of a Simon & Schuster issue than an Amazon issue but Amazon is the one selling it.Unfortunately this is becoming more and more of a problem with Star Trek ebooks. I can't say about other Simon & Schuster titles but I'm assuming they can't be much different.Be forewarned before buying this ebook. If formatting means anything to you, look elsewhere or buy a cheap, used paper copy."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"When looking for a rear view camera for my camera I had several things I was looking for: 1. wired not wireless since I read wireless is awful, turns on when in reverse, night vision, and display in the mirror. This met all the requirements. I had it professionaly installed and it works much better than expected. The picture is fantastic and night vision works great. It turns everything black and white. The only complaint is how big the camera is and how big the mirror is. The mirror is not standard size and maybe 1"" bigger top to bottom. It is also bluish in the mirror and toned down instead of saturated like the standard mirror. However, all in all this is great. The display area is pretty big also as far as range of the camera."
4,Some nice licks,This is a fine CD that show cases some very nice playing by Jerry Donahue. If you are a Hellecasters fan then you will like this. Of all the solo albums by the members of the Hellecasters this one is the closest in its style and sound. It is not as overthe top but when listening to this you can see how much of an influence Jerry has on the Hellecasters sound. I like the version of King Authers Dream here better than the one on the 1st Helle CD. Overall good guitar work. Several songs are a little lacking but a must have if you are a fan of Jerry's playing.
2,No proper DVD cover insert,"I don't know if it's just the copy I got, but the DVD case did not come with a cover insert. It was just a plain DVD case. The image for the item clearly shows a DVD cover. The case was also cracked. Although the item is supposedly new and was sold by Amazon and not a 3rd party affiliate, it almost seems as though I got a used copy.I did a return back to Amazon."
4,very interesting for Chen & Wudang styles,The movie starts with some fragmentary demonstrations that appears to be from the Beijing Olympics opening ceremonies. Boring.There is then a very brief interview with a Yang style master and a short look at some of his classes. So-So. We see fragments of the 24 form.Then they have a long look at several Chen style masters including several detailed form demonstrations and a discussion of Chen style. This includes the relationship between the hard and soft Chen forms. Very interesting.The documentary concludes with a long look at the Wudang Mountains martial arts. Again very interesting. There are discussions of the relationships between the hard and soft forms and talks about the relationship of Taoism and martial arts in the Wudang styles. Curiously there are several form demonstrations that look a lot like the Bagua circle walking exercises.
1,Disappointed,"I bought both the Periplus Thai Dictionary and the Phrase book and was very disappointed in each. They are very basic and use some transliteration that is inaccurate. There are no 'bp' or 'dt' sounds given. These sounds are lumped together as 'p' and 't' respectively, which is simplistic and misleading. Also the books' transliteration aviods the 'eu' sounds, (written as 'ue') wish is also simplistic, inaccurate, and leads to mispronuciation of many, many, Thai words. I wish I'd spent a little more money and bought better books."
5,Great!,"An excellent continuation of the Spirit of Appalachia series. It continues on with Hawk and Elizabeth's life after Hawk goes back to his family in the East to retrieve his son, whom he hopes will forgive him of his mistake of leaving him with his grandparents after his wife dies. It's a super book and I encourage all to read it!"
4,Astro Pneumatic 1426 1/4-Inch Heavy Duty Hand Riveter,"I have used products like the Astro Pneumatic 1426 1/4-Inch Heavy Duty Hand Riveter in the past, but I was well pleased with the ease of changing out the Astro Pneumatic tips. The safety feature of placing the ""catcher"" in the middle to stop you from pinching your hands, as the heavier rivets (1/4 inch) are set, really works well. I would highly recommend the product based on its price and performance in setting auto body rivets."
1,No luck with this one,Right out of the box this unit did not work correctly so I had to return it; so frustrating. It would not grab and pull the rivet.
1,This item will not do the job.,"Sorry to say this item does not do the job. I needed to install 4 1/4"" rivets and was only able to get one in place. Ruined 3 others and finally did the job using bolts. Returned this item as defective. A piece of junk."
1,junk riveter,You sent me two of these pieces of junk and neither one of them worked. Finally went to a tool store and bought one that worked for $15 less.
4,Good Quality for the price !,For a do it your selfer I found this works great. I'll probably only use this a few times in my lifetime but for the money you can't beat it. You've gotta have it if your replacing power window motors.
2,"Works OK, but parts fall off because of poor fit.","I have two complaints about this riveter.1. The different heads are very easy to lose. They are stored in threaded holes in the handle, but do not tighten down like every other riveter. The sloppy fit makes them easy to lose. Replacements are not available. I have lost several, but, fortunately, was able to find them. I no longer depend on the threaded holes for storage.2. The plastic jar to catch the used stems is a loose fit on its cap, and falls off while in use, spilling them all over.What is it with China and threads?But, it does pull 1/4 rivets, so I will just have to live with its faults. I would give it 4 stars without those faults."
1,Solid Mechanics,"Product broke after first use. Received in the mail late. Hope the warranty service works. The overall Riveter was a solid piece of equipment, but overall i'm unsatisfied. IF the manufacturer decides to honor the warranty, i'll change my review to at least a neutral comment. It was a good price and I have used Astro Pnuematic products in the past. I used the product 100% to the specified methods included in the instructions, to include the interchangeable tip for different sized rivets. It took 5 tries to get the first rivet to work. The second rivet broke the Riveter and the inner mechanics fell out in my engine. After I found all the pieces, I tried to reassemble for my own sake. Worked for one use and fell apart again.Overall thoughts, pay more for a name you know more about, or hope the warranty is good."
3,Works - but larger than I expected,"These work fine, but were larger than I expected. They are not high quality, but they were not high priced..."
4,Heavy Duty,Just long and need to have room to have a straight shot on your rivet. Takes very little effort with steel rivets.
3,Did not work at first,"I had to take this apart and fix the grabbing jaws, there was an ""extra"" piece of cast metal on one of the jaws. Took a little bit of work but so far so good after the repair. Pulls strong with minimal effort."
3,Not bad,"I compared this CD to a CD by Sir Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra containing many of the same pieces (King Lear, Roman Carnival and Le Corsair). While this CD is good, the LSO is clearly a better orchestra, and their playing is tighter and cleaner. Please keep in mind, however, that I'm really only comparing the orchestras, and not so much the conductors or their interpretations."
4,Moving music,Hard to believe that someone who was raised on country would buy this CD.However I heard Roman Canavale in person and had to have it.
3,Concurring with Staceybr's review,In general I concur with the previous reviewer (staceybr)comments. But the writing style took the edge of it (in my humble opinion). This was in stark contrast to a book of the same Genre - Where Heavens Meet - by the female author k.t. Frankovich
2,Spiritual Mystic?,"I did not like this book. First of all Mrs. Perez never defines what a socalled ""spiritual mystic"" is, even though she insists that she is one. 2.She brags about her spriritual achievemnts and drops many names, which makes that I seriously question her spirituality. 3.The experiences she relates become very repetitive and uninteresting after a while. 4.The language is not very strong."
1,Not so Hot,"It would be a good thermos if the cap wouldn't leak both liquid and heat. Sometimes when I pour, it likes to come out from underneath the cap making a mess. I have to stop pouring immediately and retighten the cap to make the seal work. But the main gripe I have about this thermos is that it doesn't keep it any hotter than thermoses I've paid half as much for. Go get a Nissan thermos. The cap is one piece. You unscrew it a little to make it pour and it keeps the drink hot longer. This Zoji cap design has too many moving parts and rubber pieces for seals that don't work very well. I'm thinking of sending mine back."
5,A five star product,"I bought this vaccum bottle for my baby. It can hold the temperature of hot water inside for a very long time. Also, it's very convenient to use. A great product beyond my expectation!I highly recommend it to other people."
1,LEAKS A LOT,"I had high hopes for this thermos, but the dang thing leaks so much that I think I'll retire it on the first day."
5,Best ever !!,This is one of the best vacumm bottles I have ever owned !! I can put ice cubs in it and 24 hours later they are still there. Holds it temp. I have owned several bottle in the past and none even start to live up to this one. I have a job that I have to be on the go from 10 to 15 hours a day. This has been a life safer for me.
2,Keeps Coffee Nice and Hot but the Peeling Teflon Ain't too Cool,"In general, I love Zojirushi products, and in fact I loved this vacuum bottle for about the first three months or so, at least until the teflon started peeling off and started to appear in my coffee. Same thing happened to my wife's Zojirushi Tuff Slim. No more Zojirushi vacuum bottles for me."
1,I was disappointed,I bought the book and read it. It did not tell what to do about nuclear waste. The title is very misleading.
3,mumble,"i didn't realize that bauhaus was a heavy metal band. a somewhat decent attempt at adulation. great production value, but its a good thing the songs are so strong. if only we could have taught these bands how to announciate. bauhaus deserves better."
3,What an eye opener.,"It is unfortunate to witness a man's need for power under the guise, ""For the People"""
4,Very interesting,"Contrary to other reviews listed here, this contains many facts--and most aren't in dispute. This book gives you a true picture of both Clintons, not the spin images of the national media. My complaint? Tyrrell is not the writer he thinks his is, and the style grows tiresome."
1,Reckless disregard for facts,"If you love to hate Bill Clinton, this book is for you. It's sort of a detailed catalog of the kind of often baseless, always careless, allegations the spastically critical Tyrrell has been spouting for all these years in his slander sheet, The American Spectator (who's publication has been funded largely by covert rabid-right wingers with known links to racist organizations). In those few cases where the allegations that he repeats are founded on more then greatly strained circumstantial evidence and shameless innuendo, Tyrrell, like Ken Starr, is quite pleased to pass along, without qualification, the word of paid convicted purjorers as if it were reliable fact. If you aren't one of those insipid morons, you won't want to be guilty of contributing to the coffers of this shill. Read it from the library."
1,"A ""funny"" little book","This is a ""funny"" little book written by the editor of Richard Mellon Scaife's American Spectator. Scaife the money bag behind the ""Arkansas (or Get Clinton) Project"" has funded another winner. It's just so ""funny"" who Mr. Tyrrell's boss is. There are probably alot of people who will be suckered by this guy."
5,GREAT Product!!!!!,"I ordered this for a Family Member who had been having a LOT ofstomach issues. She'd also been on VERY strong antibiotics. Got her on this and it didn't take very long, before she was able to eat anythingthat she wanted. Also the shipping time was Amazingly fast. Neverhad anything arrive so fast. Without having express shipping. WOulddefinitely recommend product/company to others"
5,Outstanding Read On How To Use The Power Of Our Subconscious Mind,Another outstanding book by Raymond Charles Barker. This book teaches you how to use the power of your subconscious mind to manifest your conscious mind desires. He teaches you how these two minds are really two phases of God's One Mind. This book is also worth reading several times.
4,"Don't let the tittle fool you, the recipes inside are not old fashion recipes coming out of grandma's recipe box","Of all places where I spotted this book was in a new age shop, while vacationing on the Big Island of Hawaii. I was pretty surprised about the recipes in the book, which are pretty modern recipes because of the cover I was expecting old school recipes. It is a pretty easy, clean, and very simple read on the recipes. The book covers from American to Asian to Italian and other ethic recipes. As a beginner cook, this book has been great. I own the 2nd book, Mom's Best Desserts, and looking forward to ordering the 3rd book that is coming out soon. I have to agree with the previous review that My mother never made any of these recipes but I wish she did."
1,You can't judge a book by it's cover,"a) How many ""Moms"" do you know who make Cajun Macque Choux?b) I didn't find even one recipe that took only one dish to prepare.c) How many ""Moms"" use ingredients like saffron threads or capers on a regular basis?The title implies comfort food...don't be fooled. Just reading the book stressed me out because of the often hard to find ingredients and the numerous ""pots and pans"" needed to create even one recipe. Not even Martha Stewart would consider these ""comforting"" (as claimed on the cover) or ""one dish"" (as claimed in the title)."
1,not a user-friendly book,"In this book, plant ID terminology is arranged by plant structure category - by roots, stems, leaves, etcetera. Some plant keys do not indicate on what structure a particular character is located. This would not be an issue if the book had an INDEX! It does not! So when you come to the part in the plant key that says ""perianth absent or reduced to very minute scales"" where do you begin looking for the definition of ""perianth""? Do you look for it in the leaf section? Root section? If there was an index in this book it would be much more user-friendly."
5,Useful & Necessary Companion,"This is the kind of book every beginning botanist ought to have. Directing an herbal medicine school, I teach people how to use a technical key, in our case ""Manual of the Vascular Flora of the Carolinas."" Having this book at hand means that my students don't have to memorize the 30 different ways that a leaf can be hairy -- pubescent, tomentose, scurfy, etc.For those of us who aren't botany majors (and maybe some who are), having this book at your side while keying out a plant is indispensable. Can't think of another book like it."
4,Plant Parts,"Plants are confusing and the name connected to a plant part is not always clear. This book, with its many line drawings, makes identification much easier when you are using a plant identification key. I recommend it, not so much for in the field but when you are at home with specimens in front of you and a key beside you. rp"
3,Best Civil War Timeline I've Seen,This is the best Civil War Timeline I've seen yet.It mainly concentrates on the generals and battles of the Civil War.It could have been better if they included some of the unknown (to many people) weapons and ships.Exp: they should have hade something on the gatling gun.
3,Alternative Source,"Rather than the abbreviated version, I'd point folks to Coyote Press of Salinas CA which carries facsimiles of the original 1894 Smithsonian publication with original Chinook language text and Boas' interlineal translation. The original version rates 5 stars: fascinating texts that include, in addition to myths, Q'elti's (Charles Cultee's) expositions on cultural and historical aspects of Chinook/Clatsop life including their first interaction with shipwrecked Europeans who they thought might be bears with human faces."
2,do not glow for long,"They do glow quite brightly, I would imagine for a child's room would be nice. I thought they would glow for longer, though - wanted to stick on light switches to be able to find them in the dark. Does not work for that as it stops glowing quite quickly"
2,NOT what is pictured,"Just note that these are SMALL stars of the SAME SIZE. I think it is in the product description, but the first picture of the product on the amazon website shows a child in bed looking at glow in the dark stars of different sizes. This is not what this product is. A little misleading."
4,Not that bad,My wife and I brought these stars to go in our daughter bedroom and our bedroom. We also brought a pack of assorted sizes by the same company. They do not glow for as long as I would like them to the adhisive that went with the larger size stars just didn't work at all which upset me a little but I took it as a learning lesson. My wife and I are going to buy another pack of the smaller stars because we like the way the small stars look but this time I'm going to buy my own adhesive to stick them to the ceiling. Overall not that bad.
4,Stars,The stars were a fun purchases. They don't always stick the best on certain surfaces but for the most part they work great. Decent product
3,ehh...,"The adhesive that comes with these stars isn't so great. For how tiny these things are, one would think that it would be fine, but I keep having to pick them up from the floor. Probably not a good idea if kids like to put things in their mouth. Seems to not work even with them on the wall instead of the ceiling. Using a different putty works fine, though."
2,Not worth the $$$$$,"I purchased this item for my 2 years old son bedroom. Although he love the stars, there are a few reasons why I would not suggest for a consumer to purchase this item. 1st: When I received the stars I was suprised by how few stars were in the package and how mini the stars actually were. 2nd: Each stars come with a very tiny adhesive sticker that has to be placed on each individual tiny star by hand. This can be very annoying an tedious!. 3rd: The stars are not durable. I have had them on the wall for approx 3 weeks now and they are falling off of the wall! Also there are no refill adhesive stickers included within the packaging to replace them onto the walls. 4th: The amt of time they glow is for about 10-15 mins after that they just fade. :(. If my son didnt love these stars I would have returned them but hes attached and I just cant bring myself to remove them form his wall.Hope this helps:)"
2,Twinkle Twinkle Dim Stars,My daughter liked the stars the first night for 10 minutes; after that she couldn't see them. The following nights she didn't care for them. I just wish they would glow for a longer period.
4,Stars,"I thought I bought a star pack that had different sizes, but these are all mini. I guess that's my fault. Otherwise, these are as described."
3,mini stars,they were ok. kinda small but they did say mini's. the package should've had more tape included with the stars
5,Great for college dorm and rooms,I bought this for college and it works perfectly. It a decent amount of stars to create a customize constellation
2,Not a all as expected,The stars do not stick well to the walls and do not glow as brightly as shown. Kids and I were quite disappointed...
3,Decent,"Keeps glow the longest out of all my stars, but usually only lasts about 30 minutes. Also they've been falling off left and right, so the adhesive isn't that great."
1,Bag o' Plastic,"I bought this kit to install a Pioneer radio in my 1998 Accord. When I got the dashboard apart and got the factory radio out it became obvious to me that the Metra kit was not only unnecessary for the installation but that its light weight plastic parts are far inferior to the sturdy metal bracket that Honda used. The only reason I can imagine for using this kit is if you want to leave out the small storage box, or ""pocket"", below the OEM radio; the Metra kit includes a face plate that covers up this area. You can opt to use the Metra kit and keep the pocket by cutting off the bottom of the kit's frame, but this makes the entire installation even flimsier than it already is. So, if your Honda came with a radio in the first place so that it has the OEM bracket, you don't need this bag o' plastic."
5,awsome game!,i got this game it's great but bloody a little bit very hard i have never beat it oh well it's great! but if you're under the age of 8 do not play lol get this game!
5,"Highly durable, comfortable, and unique","Absolutely loved these shoes. Highly durable, comfortable, and a great way to show off your team spirit. Just wish I could find another pair as mine are finally wearing out.P.S. You may need to order a half-size larger; Reebok shoes tend to be smaller."
2,Same Old Airplanes and Stories,"I subscribed to this magazine because it is interesting and I would like to learn more about jet R/C aircraft. However, they always have the same aircraft in their articles. All you see is fighters and this type aircraft. I have never seen one article about commerical airliners or military transports in their magazine. I am surprised there is not ONE US manufacturer of airliners. On You Tube and other web sights people say they want to know where to purchase these airliners. Hong Kong, Australian, and other overseas companies are making these and must be doing a great business and these airliners are not cheap. They run about $ 2500 each. I wrote the publisher and he said there was a lot of interest in this subject and maybe in the future they would write about it. To date nada!!!! Think I will try it one more year but if nothing appears the magazine will be toast."
1,you get what you pay for.,"oh my, I think I paid three bucks for this. well, I won't be too negitive.it might be ok for a small ball or little tires. but spend the extra money and get a good tire pump."
4,Mellisa&Doug Magnetic Letters and Numbers,great product for preschool kids.It would be great to have more vocals so you can build longer words or shorter sentences. The sellers shipped the product as it promised.
5,so much fun,My son loves this. Perfect for older children wanting to learn to spell. I leave him a message on the fridge often and he thinnks it is sooo cool
1,Bundled letters are poor quality,The original letters I bought were wonderful! To increase the words we could write I bought this bundled package; the quality is very different. These letters and numbers are not glossy and the paper covering them was peeling with several letters arriving broken. I suggest only buy the individual packages.
3,Worth to buy for learners,They could have added few colurs to the letters. Only four colors repeating. If they add more colors we teach the colors also.
4,Great magnets,"This stick very well. Our daughter is still too young to fully enjoy these, as she sticks everything in her mouth."
2,Breaks. Instantly.,"I love that these are wood instead of plastic. We searched for wood ones and were so happy to find them. But they are NOT sturdy. The magnets come off pretty quickly, even with minimal play. We wrote a letter to the company, and they did replace them, but it was not a flaw with that one set. The new set did the same thing. One by one we have just had to throw them away. What a waste."

5,The Starseeds are forever among us!,"I don't feel like I can elaborate much more on what has already been said by almost every other reviewer here, except that Parallel Life is a manifestation of utter musical perfection. If you listen carefully, you will hear sounds you never caught the previous time around, the previous one before that, etc, etc. The highly dreamy, complex rhythms and soundscapes coupled with Regina's breathy, unearthy vocals will transport its listener to a faraway galaxy in the midst of unfathomable glory and awe. The music is so spacey and cosmic, yet utterly warm and sensual - a highly unique effect that no other artist can create. While the album is now scarce, buying it used here is worth every penny, as is purchasing the (currently) in print double-cd version which contains their brilliant follow-up album along with it. In a nutshell: Words like ""beautiful"" do not even come close to doing this album descriptive justice by a lightyears distance."
3,The Starseeds '- Parallel Life,"The Starseeds, for their debut album, PARALLEL LIFE, help you drift into outer space with some intertellar downtempo. Everything here is mellow, with some whispery vocals for additional texture. ""Behind the Sun"" seems to be the epitome of their work: this is a universe without harshness and deep bass throbs to accompany the flightiness. A hint of funk slips into ""Timequakes,"" while ""Heavensairportcoffeeshoprestaurant"" opts for a dreamy denseness. ""Subspace Radio Signals"" adds some tribal percussion to the mix, while ""Regina From The Future"" goes all ambient. ""Earth Moon And Stars"" introduces a didgeridoo and some folk guitar strumming, and ""Elsewhere"" goes back to blissful. Not groundbreaking, but exceedingly pleasant."
3,A few outstanding tracks - the rest very average!,"I owned this CD once. I wished I had kept it as it is now worth quite a bit. I copied the only three 'worthwhile tracks' - Behind the Sun, Heavensairportcoffeshoprestaurant and Parallel Life - and then traded it in at Ye Olde Used CD store. For those of you who have only heard the above three tracks, before you put out $40+ of your hard-earned cash, know that there is at least one soul out there who thinks that the rest of the CD is so-so!"

3,E for effort,"This is a rather interesting performance and recording. All the elements for a potentially memorable rendition of this piece of music is there: a small orchestra, a choir, an organ, soloists and of course, the conductor. Somehow, unfortunately, it did not deliver. The performance was, in two words, shy and timid. Comparing it to the bonus track by Bach, it was obvious that the choir have sung that a lot more than the Dubois. The microphone placement was also too distant. The organ was hardly noticeable. The strings were at times amateurish. The winds, thank goodness, did not disappoint. The soloists were actually very good. I wish they would do it again and give it more oomph and closer miking to bring out the nuisances of the story. Get this recording simply because it is rather unique in that it has an orchestra and turn up the volume when you play it!"
3,the old college try,Exultate's performance is a solid college/church choir level performance. The orchestra has pitch/tuning issues at times. The chorus is quite good. A descent amateur performance... not on par with Robert Shaw. The piece is sung in English.
3,It's OK,"This recording of The Seven Last Words of Christ is just OK. The tempi drag in many of the movements and the soloists are terrible at best. The timbre of the choir is very dark which indicates that the singers' technique is not any different than that of most British/American choruses. If you enjoy that dark, flat, ""blended"" sound, you will enjoy it. However, if you are interested in hearing what the piece sounds like as a whole, again, it's OK for that reason."
1,Amaturish,I was greatly disappointed in the performance. The baritone is somewhat adequate but the soprano and tenor are bad. The soprano stays just below the pitch the whole time. The chorus is okay. Because listening to the two higher soloists is somewhat akin to listening to fingernails scraping against a chalkboard I will never listen to this recording of a great work again.
2,The Seven Last Words,"I was disappointed in the overall performance. Since I intend to use it as a rehearsal aid, I find the lack of tonal accuracy in the Soprano soloist to be a major distraction. Her attempts at coloring the various pasages were woefully inadequate.While the Tenor soloist was at least true to pitch throughout the work, there was a lack of energy and firmness in his presentation that detracted from his delivery.The Baritone soloist saved the trio from a very low rating in my opinion with a confident and convincing rendering.Choral balance was fair, but the recording did seem to suffer from perhaps a lack of understanding of the work by the audio engineer."
2,An unworthy rendition,"I was disappointed when I heard this recording of one of my favorite pieces of religious choral music. The orchestra was not quite in tune and the soloists, particularly the soprano, were not always on pitch. ""The Storm"" in the last word was an organ cop-out with tympanie, single chord changes with drum. And I must admit, I really disliked this English translation. All in all, a passionless recording."
2,no luck attracting birds,"Placed this in a large blooming Ocotillo Cactus that the hummingbirds had been working!! I knew the blooms would soone be gone and wanted to keep my birds around. Never had one try to drink from this feeder, tried several reciped as well as red food color without success--It does look pretty buy I've given up on filling it"
5,Sleepless in Tacoma,"I started to read this book at 9 pm one evening and it kept me reading till I finished it at 4 am. At first it seems a folksy tale but its depth becomes apparent when you realize the price a person, especially a young girl with few opportunities except those of her own making, has to pay to live in what is suffocating comfort. The sense of claustrophobia continually grows until an explosion is inevitable. But that too comes with a terrible price. A very powerful book that was easy to read, in an unusually good translation that moves with fluency and grace. As I said, I couldn't put it down."
2,"Nice design, but poor workmanship","I've purchased 4 of these in 3 orders over the years. The first order everything was perfect and I really liked the design - they fit in perfectly with my art-deco house.The 2nd order not so well. I purchased 2 of these in that order and they both could not be properly assembled because the screw holes didn't align with the bracket. I had to use a drill press to fix them so they were usable.The final order also had a problem. In this case the screw stud was too short to allow the bracket to be attached to the fixture. I had to work the stud out of the bracket and concoct my own.Assembled and in place I like these, but for as expensive as they are you would think they would be of a higher build quality than they are."
5,Very impressed!!,Wow...I have to say that I was very impressed by this most recent Balance release. Masiello shows us all why he is now in the DJ spotlight. Both discs are fairly different in my opinion. Disc 1 starts out with a fantastic track by Will Saul which sets the stage for the entire album. We then progress through an excellent track selection that makes you want more and more.Disc 2 is quite different as it starts out a little slower and more progressive. Whatever Desyn had in mind for both discs is definatly working at this point. I would have to agree with the other reviews in that the end of disc 2 is epic. It ends a little early...but starting with track 12 you will get chills up and down your spine.Not to be missed.
2,overrated,"totally overrated. felt compelled to write a review because everyone else proclaims this release is perfection and the mix of the year.disc one is strong and on for the first 4 tracks and then becomes totally monotinous and dull until the closing track which is superb. disc two doesn't move me at all except for its classic intro with orbital.If you are looking for good stuff for your crate seek out the aforementioned on 12"" and don't waste your time buying this."
3,Don't buy into the hype. It is that good but there is better,"This Cd is really good. No seriously, it is probably one of the most interesting mixes for 2005. There is only one problem. James Holden. His balance installment makes masiello's look like something my kid sister would do;It is that good. But whether you like it or not you have to give Masiello plenty of Kudos for coming up with a mixing stlye and track selection that is truly original, searingly danceable and energetic. Too bad it simply isn't genius. But no matter, we have Holden and Sasha for that."
1,BBOORRIINNGG.. Is this the official death of house / prog?,"I'm going to keep this short and simple.It is my belief that electro has infected and destroyed progressive house.There is very little here to want me to keep these CD's in the stereo. I just can't hear anything that would make me want to listen to them a second time.Numbing and dumbing, plain and simple.Looking forward to a progressive house revival circa 1996 through 2002."
1,Not as expected,"When you buy a dash kit for a marine radio, its understood that it should be water tight or resistant or what ever you want to call it, it should not let water or moisture get to your radio, after all this is the point. This dash kit has a seal which does not do its job, it is of poor quality and lets water in. Am not sure if the door was supposed to be spring loaded, but mine was completely limp when I got it. I replaced the original seal with an other one, and now its doing what its supposed to do, Hope the hinges and lock last, but don't have high hopes on that. Wouldn't recommend this product."
2,lid slams open plastic hinges shatter,The unit is very nice and shipped fast !!!!!!! BUT BEWARE OF SPRING LOADED LID IT FLINGS OPEN THEN SNAPS THE HINDGES POOR CONSTRUCTON OF HINDGES!! UNIT IS STILL INSTALLED AND LID SNAPS BUT IS ON EDGE OF BEING DESTROYED.... 1ST TRY SNAP!!
5,"Parts fit, works well","Parts fit, works well. Pain to get old assembly apart to install new parts.Good product or time will prove me wrong flush by flush."
4,two times...got it right!,"had a problem with this order...item listing was not what i received. raybestos no longer makes pg plus drums. they are now plainly #2623, whichis what i received. one was ok...the other was not acceptable. no prob returning, amazon full refund. later ordered same product. great pair ofdrums (new run as per raybestos rep).better price. happy 'stanger. thank you amazon.com dgw"
2,"The answer is, at best, ""maybe"".","The author has a great topic and a great question, and does a wonderful job of not providing any straightforward substantiation for her assertions. Part ofd the problem is perhaps that ""Has feminism changed science?"" is not the question Schiebinger seems to be asking so much as ""have *women* changed science?"" By Jove, they have. But is this a new story? Save your $27.95 for later... this book offers little that is edifying or even interesting."
1,Cheap but Crap,"I bought this product because it was so cheap, I thought it was a good deal. However, when I received it it wouldn't even fit into my phone. I figured that maybe since it was for my A707 that it would fit, I was wrong. If it were to fit, I'm sure it would be a great product."
1,Incredible disappointment,"Really disappointed by this game. If you play once, you better just throw it away, because there are so many repeat questions (even in the first game we played, there were at least 3 or 4 repeat questions). Some of the questions were very poorly worded and just bad trivia questions overall. For example, there's a clip of Preist Holmes and it asks, ""What is Preist Holmes about to do? A. Hurdle a player B. Knock a player down C. Dodge a player"" (Not exact wording but the best I can remember). I could have written better trivia questions.If you're looking for a good Football trivia game, get the Ultimate Football Trivia Game by Outset Media. It's a board game, but much much better than this joke of a DVD trivia game."
3,A companion to the NCAA Football DVD Trivia Challenge!,"If you're interested in Football trivia, you can't do better than the NCAA Football DVD Trivia Challenge. This DVD game has hundreds of interactive questions about all the classic college football games and players and has one of a kind footage from Red Grange to Ricky Williams!This is a game you can't pass up. Check it out by searching for ""NCAA Football DVD Trivia Challenge"" or going to ncaatrivia dot com!"
5,This is Dispatch's best CD yet!,"While I love all of Dispatch's CDs, this one in particular has all of my favorite songs. I have seen Dispatch in concert and I think they are better then DMB. If you like Guster, Phish and Dave Matthew's band, you will love Dispatch!"
4,"Not their best, but pretty damn good","I always thought Bang Bang was their best cd, and it remains their best. Who are we living for offers some great songs such as Open Up and Carry You, but it doesnt have anything that compares to The General or Railway. Still, its one of my favorite cds, and is definitely worth the money. And to everyone who hasnt seen them live..DO IT. I didnt realize the extent of their talent until I saw them recently...They're incredible. And ""Chetro"" is gorgeous!"
5,Great CD,"I'm sort of a new Dispatch listener but ever since I gotta hold of this CD I couldn't put it down. Songs that are truly amazing are ""Carry You"", ""Time Served"", ""Headlights"", ""Open Up"", ""Passerby""....just about everyone on the album! This CD isn't exactly like the others because it's less acoustical, but it's just as good, if even better!"
4,Underrated,"For some reason, people do not view this as an essential Dispatch recording. This may be because of its evolved sounds, or simply because there is something a little different, but i can assure you that it is an amazing cd and that it is a great addition to any Dispatch fan. Once you weed through all of the instrumentals and jams that are present on this cd, some great dispatch songs emerge, ones that will yeild repeated listenes, and even enter some top fives.Hidden away on this cd are the great tracks:Open UpTime ServedLightningPrince of SpadesHeadlightsGone(My favorite Dispatch Song)Although this cd is not primarily acoustic like the previous two, this cd provides listen to the direction the band may have taken if they had stayed together longer. There is so much raw energy here, and is something no dispatch fan should miss out on. If you are just starting out, try Bang Bang as your introduction to Dispatch"
3,"Dated, but good","This book focuses on the Win32 API from a WinNT/9x standpoint, highlighting the differences between the two in a clear and concise way. If you are doing development on a Win2K box, however, then this book is probably not the best resource. The sections on the differences between WinNT and Win9x are largely irrelevant now, but the book is still a good resource for understanding how Windows works behind the scenes. If this book is updated to include current information, I would definately buy it again."
1,BEWARE OF ORDERING THIS THROUGH AMAZON,I would beware of ordering this through Amazon. I have had to return this book after several attempts of getting the order right. They keep sending me the book without the CD-Rom.. yet the cover and their site states one is included.
1,Didn't last 20 minutes,"Our year-and-a-half old, 50# pit mix chewed his own holes to get the treats out in less than ten minutes. The toy was totally destroyed in less time than it took me to decide whether to buy it or not!"
5,t shirt jersey,My son really enjoys wearing the T shirt jersey. It has washed well and delivered promtly as promised.
5,excellent grammar book,"I bought this a few years ago for an evening class. The class wasn't too good, but I worked my way through the book and found it excellent. The explanations are clear and straightforward, the vocabulary is useful, and you can actually learn a lot about how to use the subjunctive and the conditional. It also has useful information about troublesome cognates and word usage. I would recommend this quite highly for anyone trying to learn Italian. It's a review grammar so in theory you should already know a little Italian, but if you have some knowledge of French, Spanish or Latin, or if you just have a positive attitude, you should have no problems with this book."
3,"""Acceptable"" ratings","My ""acceptable"" book arrived with multiple writings by the previous owner(s). Much was written in ink. The pages had been well-used. I guess I was expecting the book to be in slightly better condition. But I did save about 50% off the suggested price."
1,Scientific method anyone?,"If its 'good medicine' I'm sure it will stand up to a little empirical study, right? Where's the double-blind controlled study?"
1,Good for a doorstop,"I followed all the instructions in the book to help my arthritis in my hip. Not only did it not help, but my hip actually got worse. I went to my doctor and he read the book and tried to find any scientific support for Dr. Burroughs claims but couldn't. His advice was that the lemonade diet is not nutritionally complete and may cause anemia, which I now have. Maybe this advice works for some, but definitely not for me."
2,Badly formatted Kindle version,"Think twice about buying the Kindle version, it was not formatted correctly and is difficult to read.As far as the content goes, it seems sound. I have had great results from fasting. Arthritic pain vanishes and my energy increases. As with everything in this world, take responsibility for your own health and actions. Learn about your body and what it can or cannot take. Everyone is different."
1,Cuisinart Poor Quality Products,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! It simply stopped working less than 1 year after purchase. I also purchased a Cuisinart coffee burr grinder and it lasted about 3 months. Forget about trying to contact Cuisinart customer service, I tried finding it on-line and after an hour searching I gave up. Never again will I purchase a Cuisinart product."
1,Don't Buy It!,Don't buy this coffeemaker. It stops working after several months and customer service at Cuisinart is very poor. There are lots of reviews on another page about this. Many people have experienced the same problem. I don't know why the reviews are not on this page also.
4,Delivers conveniently.,"This is our third one of these. It makes good coffee, and delivers a cup at a time conveniently.It seems to last for two or three years and then the relay that controls the heating element gets flakey. You can keep it running long enough to order a new one (who can afford a repair shop these days) by slapping it on the side a few times until it starts brewing. (Otherwise it would get 5 stars.)It only delivers coffee into a cup (no carafe) although you can pull out the cistern and pour into a thermos if you need to.We never use the programming feature as we don't get up at the same time everyday. We do use and like the Auto-Off feature after 4 hours.My recipe is: fill water to 9-cup level, and put a level half-cup measure of coffee into the basket. A little more for 11 cups; a little less for 7.My wife is German, and likes coffee a bit stronger than the usual coffee you get here."
1,"Great idea, poor design and too expensive","This is a great concept but the design is awful and the price to way too high. The unit will drip and then quit working - period. The person who said cuisinart customer is very poor is right. They wanted me to send the unit back at my expense. They did send another unit, and it had the exact same problem, it leaked and then quit working. Did not even work for a year."
3,Nice small book,"The author lists five categories of sales objections: * Appointment Objections * Price Objections * Objections to Time * Exprience * Credentials and * Need. It is arguable if this is enough, but what doesn't seem enough are the methods he cites for handling them (exactly two): a solid six-step method, and (with reservations) the old feel-felt-found formula. It would have been a great book if it would have named even more examples and used them to build a sales (questioning) structure to prevent them from showing up in the first place."
1,Amazon Needs To Learn How to Pack Fragile Items,"I guess this is less of a review of the item as it is how it arrived at my house. In a million tiny pieces. One bowl in a box big enough to hold about 50 books. A little bubble wrap, not much else. So disappointed and amazed this happened - a wedding gift undeliverable because of Amazon carelessness. Never again. The bowl was lovely I'm sure. The color is great."
1,Boring,"In a few words, this movie takes way to long to take off. CONTAGIO is boring, slow paced and when the action starts, it's rather dull. The special FX are ok to good but that is the only redeeming quality this movie has besides the cool DVD art. There is not one likeable character in the movie that you can really attach yourself to, no chemistry between them at all, I felt no sympathy for any of them. The acting is very low grade and some of the camera work is shoddy. There could not have been ANY color correction on this film because some of the scenes were blown out and appear colorless. It's a story that's been told over and over again. I'm glad I only paid 99 cents for this movie. Sorry, but I can not recommend CONTAGIO for a good time.Schroeder/Cult Movies Magazine & TV"
3,Disappointed,"The shoes are pretty. I bought the bronze. However, I'm disappointed because the first time I wore them the shirring on one foot came apart.Its a good thing I konw how to use a needle and thread!!!"
3,Don't waste your money,The only two good scenes were the fight scenes.A perfect way to waste 98 minutes.Save your money and buy Freddy's Dead:The Final Nightmare.
2,Pretty dissapointing,"I had to see this movie of course because I had seen the nightmare on elm street movies, and the Jason movies as well. There was a story line, and some of the actors were okay, but overall this movie itself was just too gory. That's it, if you're the kindof person who just wants to see a bunch of gore, then maybe this movie is for you. I wouldn't buy it, rent it first."
3,Johnny Depp in a cameo...am I wrong?,"Hey, was that Johnny Depp in the cornfield party scene? He's one of the ""kids"" dancing. He's got those stupid glow sticks in his hands and the camera passes by him as he's dancing, just before that geek kid disses the black chick. Johnny Depp was one of the stars of the original Nightmare On Elm Street and also had a small part in one of the later films in that series."
2,Freddy and Jason,I am a huge horror buff and this is really a bad movie but if you have collection of freddy and jason it's avaliable for 1.95 that should tell you something. I wish I would have paid only a dollar 25 for it that is about how much it is worth. Micheal Myers was the first Boogey Man from Halloween and Jason was next it should have been made with them instead of freddie it might have made a difference. I can't beleive this was promoted so much it well sucks. unless you are a collector and want to complete collection of freddy and Jason 1.25 is about what it is worth.
3,it would be better if Kelly Rowland wasn't in it!,"seriously, way better! one thing I didn't expect to see was someone from Destiny's Child trying to act. Kelly Rowland comes up short. don't get me wrong, she's pretty, but Destiny's Child sucks! it was fun to watch this movie and see Freddy and Jason kick each other's rumps. i would have liked it better if a chick that was into metal played Kia."
3,"7,8, Dont stay up late...","Kind of a terrible movie, but its cool battle scenes and cutting-edge special effects make it fun to look at.a companion film to both FRIDAY THE 13TH and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET,but FREDDY VS. JASON is an unsatisfying 98 minutes to waste, epecially on halloween night."
5,So far the best action movie ever made,"This is one of the best action films Ive ever, infact mayb the best film Ive ever seen.I watched this film atleast 15 time and never got tired of it.If u didnt see Freddy vs Jason yet, well get and fastened your seat belts for the battle that will blow u away."
2,Best summer film of 03,"I saw this movie in theatres and loved it i thought it was extremely well done and right then i knew i had to get it on DvD when it was finally released. I only had a few bones to pick and those were mostly about jason. Kane Hodder didnt play him, and Ken kizinger well he moved to fast for jason he made jason look like he was at a medium walking pace through the whole thing. Jason is supposed to be a stalking killing machine not a marathon jogger. Other than that it was probably one of the best films i saw all summer. I already pre-ordered my copy of the DvD and i would definetly recommend this film to hard core fans of both horror icons, even if your not big in this kinda of movie you will get alot of pleasure out of seeing it."
2,worth the wait?,"Child murderer Freddy Krueger (of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET fame)resurrects woodsy summer camp stalker Jason Voorhees (FRIDAY THE 13TH series) to murder a few of the new generation Elm Street kids in order to spread the fear of his name. But when Jason goes rogue a bloody showdown sparks between the two genre icons. Forget originality, this slasher yarn plays its formula just like any other modern teen horror; dumb dialogue, t&a, graphic voilence and cliches galore. The imagination and freshness of the NIGHTMARE series has vanished. Still, give it small credit for England's good as always performance (as the first title lead) and an action charged finale. Hard to believe this was in development for ""eleven"" years. Sean S. Cunningham (FRIDAY THE 13TH creator) produced."
2,Is That All There Is?,"Freddy Vs. Jason is just as interesting as the famous Ali vs. Antonio Ianoki much, pitting boxer against wrestler. In the end, it was a boring draw. As I recall, After this bout, thousands of fans walked away from Shea Stadium in New York City shaking their heads in sheer disgust and disbelief. . . . . Just like you will after watching this film. Beleive me, it is totally uninspired. As a matter of fact, this is one of those films that Mike Nelson and his pals, Tom Servo and Crow, will eventually have fun ripping apart on Science Mystery Theater 3000.However, because I like both Freddy and Jason, I give this film two stars -- one for Jason, and one for Freddy."
1,Umm...no,"This film is not really that good. It takes place in Springwood, of course and plays out like a Nightmare On Elm Street movie but has the feel of Friday The 13th to it. Does this mixture work well? Of course not.The acting was incredibly pitiful, especially that of the actress that played Lori. If only they used the ending where she had died...I woulda been happier. Ken Whatshisname just isn't Kane Hodder, alright? He isn't in the least bit creepy. But, as usual, Robert Englund is awesome as Freddy.The special effects were rediculously bad. Blood doesn't just spew all over the place, and it was TOO red. The CGI was alright, but definately not the best I've seen.The storyline was crap, and very VERY horribly written. There WERE a couple of good parts, and those parts were the comic relief.Overall, this is just a generic slasher flick with a horrible plot and effects, with very little entertainment. Maybe the sequel will be better.1 out of 5."
4,On Blu-Ray : good buy,"Review on Blu-ray: a good buy, beautiful pics and crystal clear images.On movie itself: i am a die-hard fan of Freddy and Jason, this movie is simply fun, fun and fun. I love it."
3,Canadian import,"Like other Canadian releases from Alliance, the picture and the sound are very good on this disc but there are absolutely no bonus features. If you want extras, get the DVD. If you just want the best possible presentation of the movie itself, this Blu-ray is a good choice. Note: This disc is region A, meaning it will play on North American machines but it will probably not be playable in Europe."
5,FREDDY VS. JASON.....PLACE YOUR BETS!!!,"If you love A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, or both, you'll definitely love Freddy Vs. Jason! I love the awesome fighting sequences between them. I love all the blood and gore when they slash at each other! I remember seeing this with a friend when it first came out. There were some parts we laughed at, some we thought were cool. If you love slashers fighting, you'll love FREDDY VS. JASON!!!"
3,Needed Kane Hodder,"This movie has the typical formula for a modern day horror film; Blood that looks too fake, a cast of teens you would see on an MTV show, a couple semifamous stars, sex, violence and gore, and drugs. This movie was for the Nightmare on Elm Street fan. Freddy had most of the film and yes, I know Jason cant talk. It was good to see Freddy in a film again though. Robert Englund is a treat to watch, i'd highly recommend him in 1001 Maniacs. It had a good plot but the cast was really annoying. Also, Kane Hodder, the Jason in the last four Friday films, was left out for a unknown actor. Hodder was the best Jason and his presence in this movie is missed. A good movie with a few good fight scenes between Jason and Freddy. The killings in this movie weren't really speical. Id recommend it to people who love horror or just have every Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th dvd."
3,Couldve been better...,"I liked the movie and all but i find one major problem with it... Its robert englunds first time playing freddy in about 9 years, and we only see him killing one person (directly)? What a rip off. I was looking forward to more than that. But otherwise i enjoyed it."
4,A lot of fun to watch,"Ronny Yu definately did justice to both of the franchises. Freddy is up to his old tricks, while Jason is as menacing as ever. After witnessing the horrendous ""Jason X"", I was worried that this one would follow in the same direction. Thank God; it does not. This film is very modern but still manages to get in lots of the horror movie staples of the 80's - T and A, booze, drugs,ridiculous one liners out of Mr. Kreuger, and of course GORE! There is lots of grue in here folks especially in the final act. This is a film made for Freddy and Jason fans and does not disappoint either set. I'd expect to see more movies set in Elm St. and Crystal Lake in the near future. No, this is not a spoiler. There is an end, but you must know that either of these dudes can come back at any time no matter what if you are reading this. Enjoy!"
5,Made Me Feel Like I Was Back in the 80's!!!,"This is the only current horror movie that brought back the feeling of an 80's horror movie. The terrible acting, I thought, made the movie even better because that's how the horror movies from the 80's were. If you are like me and prefer B grade 80's horror movies, this is totally for you."
4,very fun,"Here we have Freddy, who needs the children to fear him again so he can have his powers back. What does he do? He brings back Jason. The story is kind of weak, but then again who really watches these movies for the story. Bottom line is its fun. You get to see two horror icons go head to head against each other in a film I would call more of an action-with a little horror-type film that delivers. I only wish that Freddy and Jason would have battled a little longer."
5,Awsome!,A very good slasher has freddy who is too weak to kill so he resurrects Jason and he won't stop killing! Extremely bloody movie has surprsingly good acting
3,"It was kinda dissapointing, but still good...","Yup. i was surfing online last year and came across one script for freddy vs. jason. i actually read it and i thought it was awesome. you should check it out too if you don't mind straining your eyes, here's the site:http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/jvsf_bm.txtin the movie/DVD freddy sends jason to elm street to get everyone scared and make them think it's freddy. because on one on Elm Street knows fear other than Freddy Kruger. All seems well when several teens are mrdered, Freddy's scheme is working... until Jason becomes a threat to him, causing a one-on-one battle of EVIL!!!!!!the second disc has oodles of extras, including production notes, featurettes, a music video, deleted scenes& more."
3,Somethings missing...,"As a long-standing fan of both the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, I can honestly say that I was elated to hear the movie my friends and I used to speculate would some day be made had finally been made. The end product, for the most part, did not disappoint...for the most part...My main problem with the movie is that it basically inserts Jason into the Nightmare on Elm Street Series, rather than connecting the two together. They could have easily made this a part of the Elm Street series, rather than billing as a joint production. Perhaps my bias towards the Jason series influence my opinion, but I honestly feel that a better movie could of been made.Overally, Jason vs. Freddy isn't a bad watch for fans of the series, and it doesn't disappoint completely. But for my money, it won't ever get better than Jason Goes to Hell."
3,Average although good,"Message to Hollywood: NEVER PUT AN ACTION DIRECTOR IN TO DIRECT AN HORROR FILM!!!!!!! it just doesn't work. Most of the time action directors just ruin horror movies! The acting was decent. And I really enjoyed the story but it was portrayed as an action movie more than a Horror film, which was the disapointment!"
1,Just Kill Them Both,For over twenty years these two have been ran in to the ground. Why don't they just kill them already it is getting pretty stupid by now. Come on do they think we still enjoy this [junk]. I liked the first couple of movies but it's getting very easy to tell what is going to happen. Unless Freddy has a girlfriend and they are going to the woods he is pretty safe. By the time they finish Jason off he will be in a wheelchair what is he like 100 by now. I guess they will be fighting with their canes in the next movie.
1,Biggest Piece of CRAP ever!,"maybe it was the effort for a Jay character from the beloved Jay and Silent Bob movies.maybe it was the horrible dialoguemaybe it was the idea that Jason can be knocked out, and thus dream when (in fact) he is dead.........or something.......makes no sense.maybe it was the GOD AWFUL endingmaybe it was the whole movieThis was by far the worst movie I have seen in a while. I wish that I had the power to change time so that I can use those 2 hours to watch any other movie available."
5,Awesome !!!,"I truly enjoyed the movie. I can't wait until it comes out on dvd. A lot of movie critics don't like the movie or don't understand the story. If you don't understand it, it's most likely because you don't want to understand it. The die-hard fans like me understand and appreciate all the hard work, dedication, and money that went in to making this movie. It is for fun only. It's not real life. Don't take it too seriously. It's for entertainment only!!!"
3,Pretty Darn Good Movie,"I Have To Admit, after watching this movie, I had to go out and buy it. Its not a SCARY as can be type movie, but a decent thriller. And I recommend it to anyone who likes just that type of movies."
3,An Ok flick,"When Freddy Krueger brings back Jason to kill and let everyone know he is back, freddy starts appearing in dreams again! But when Jason steals Freddy's kills, Freddy desides 'it's time to put that bad dog to sleep for good!'When I rented this movie, I expected it to be real stupid. But I was wrong. This movie is not stupid, but it wasn't good either. If you want to see a great horror flick, see the original 'Friday the 13th' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street'."
4,"A good movie, but not really what I am waiting for","I really liked this movie, and got only a little scared of it. It was more humorous, sick, and stupid than scary. What I'm really waiting for is a battle between Michael Myers from Halloween vs. Leatherface from TX. Chainsaw Massacre."
4,"extremly funny, not scary",I watched this movie with my friend. I thought it would keep me up all night. I actually laughed myself to sleep. I think this movie should be under comedy instead of horror. It is still a very good movie. I loved it and I don't really like Friday the Thirteenth or Nightmare on Elm Street. watch this if you need a good laugh.
3,An unpleasant Surprise,"Ok, so here's how I see it. For a horror movie it did have some touch to it. I guess it could have been better, but for the most part it turned out as I had suspected. Had they created a better plot it would have been fabulous, but, as horror movies often are, the plot was pretty cheezy, mostly dwelling on all the people who want revenge. I suppose that should have gone with the traditional nightmare/friday theme. As i said before the film did have some touch to it what with the main characters unknown past and all. It is probably worth your money once or twice. It wasnt all bad.""Freddy vs. Jason""starring Robert Englund, and Ken KirzingerRunning time: 91 minutesrated ""R"" for ""pervasive strong horror violence/gore, gruesome images, sexuality, drug use, and language"
1,Really a stretch,"For these movies, they should get better with each version because the budget is bigger, the audience knows the background, and the Director is given more freedom. This film was surpringly tedious. Skip it and watch the others instead."
4,4 Stars for the 5.1 EX sound,"I purchased this DVD used based on the 5.1 EX sound. The movie is what it is - a Horror movie with a touch of humor. The 6.1 sound is excellent. The rear surround speakers are effectively utilized and not just a repetition of the 5.1 surround speakers. The subwoofer rocks the house. So, if you are a fan of this genre film and are looking for a great 6.1 sound pick this movie up. Enjoy, j."
3,Match should not have been even,"This film contradicts some of the previous films. When did Freddy, for example, get the power to telekinetically move his enemy and slam him around the room? Also, when Freddy is removed from dreams and taken into the real word, he is supposed to be a regular mortal that ANYBODY can kill. That said, it should have taken Jason less that a second to kill Freddy after he was brought into the real world.Also, if Freddy draws his power from the fear of his victims, how is he able to fight Jason, who thinks of Freddy as nothing but another potential slashee?The battles were entertaining, but I think that certain powers were added and taken away from these characters just to make the match even."
3,freddy v.s jason what I think,Freddy v.s. Jason was a smart idea and kind of corny but thenagain who really cares. THe fight scene was spectactulor!although it could have been longer. all in all it was greatand I would encourage many to see it.
3,"Better than the other sequels, BUT still not the Originals!","I am a horror fan, and I liked Friday the 13th and ""Nightmare"" and this film was the merging of two big companies. It didn't terrify me in any sense, but I did love the dark moody scenery and the frequent nostalgia from the two movies villains. The film did have too much nudity, and I think that the director could have upped the scare factor. The acting from the younger cast was not very impressive, but Robert Englund was wonderful, and whoever revived Jason Voorhees made him more brutal and impersonall. The fight scenes were very cool, (reminding me of King Kong and the T-Rex fight in King Kong.) The movie, when blended together was only average and did a very half attempted job. If you are a horror fan, or a Freddy/Jason groupie see the movie, and if this isn't your taste I recommend the other horror films of 2003 which included The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake."
2,A Major Letdown,"I have never liked ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" movies beyond the first film. I have enjoyed ""Friday The 13th"" films however. Freddy as a character does nothing for me. However I like Jason and even own Jason action figures. This was Freddy's movie. Freddy was given better scenes, if that is saying much. Also, Freddy's makeup was much better than the makeup job on Jason.What is up with the annoying woman who played Jason's mother? She didn't even look like Betsy Palmer. I had to laugh at the kids with their glowsticks at the rave, and the cheesy dancing to the cheesy music. Also, The blood looks like red syrup. Why is it in all these movies they perceive psychiatric wards as places were people wander around in strait jackets and drooling?When they showed Jason as a child, what was up with the bad sound dubbing? What kind of kid makes those annoying whimpering noises?. I hear next they are considering adding Ash (Evil Dead) into the fight. UGH."
2,was out of stock,Disappointed that it was out of stock and wasn't notified until days later. It was going to be a christmas gift and I had to end up giving a gift card at last minute.
2,Movie Monsters Better Kept Apart...,"Freddy has an undying craving for more murdering of young children, and therefore seeks help by manipulating Jason Voorhees to murder some children on Elm Street. As the gruesome murders begin, someone whispers Freddy's name and once again the town of Springwood is cursed. Freddy Vs. Jason is an attempt in making a horror film that turns into a gory Wrestle-Mania with movie monsters. As the end credits cross the screen, the audience has endured a rather poor cinematic experience."
4,what happend to michael,"i dont want to be a complainer but what happend to michael myers. He was the first one out there. I think they should of put michael in there, it would of been great with micheal vs jason. Freddys cool and everything but hes just not like jason and michael. But im goin for both freddy and jason cuz its stupid not to. this movie is going to be awesome. i saw the trailer at the siteand it looked great im really looking foward to it i think freddy and jason should team up and kill all the stupid singers that they keep putting in these horror movies. even though busta rhymes was pretty funny in halloween ressurection arlight bye go to see the movie"
4,and this is like when worlds colide,this movie was great not scary but great. Ive seen all the nightmare on elm street movies and all the friday the 13 movies and the jason movies sucked but the nightmare on elm street movies were great then i saw this movie when it first came out and it was great and funny an intertaining movie. My mom said it was corney and it was'nt that bad this movie was'nt corney well it was a little but it was still great.The part that was funny was when freedy turned into that slug and then smoked pot and blew in that other guys face that was funny this was a great movie i hope part2 comes out cause the way freedy blinked his eye at the end meant that it was'nt over i hope it comes out with another great battle but great movie.
5,Freddy vs. Jason - The Ultimate Deathmatch,"I've never seen the Nightmare series except for ""New Nightmare"". Atleast in this one, there were no ridiculous bikini wearing bimbos. I always hated those swimsuits that barely cover the bare essentials. Now I know how Jason could be killed, in his mind. Freddy was able to show what happened the day Jason drowned; and all this time I thought it was at night like his mother described in ""Friday the 13th"".All they would need is Michael Myers and we'd have the greatest Triple Threat Deathmatch. In my opinion, the ""Nightmare"", ""Halloween"", and ""Hellraiser"" series were the only real horror movies worth seeing."
1,Utterly horrible,"There is nothing to say about this film except that it was a disapointing disaster. I saw it in the theatre and couldn't stop laughing at the fact that every tiny cut someone got would spurt blood across the room. This movie is altogether stupid. Don't see it.A great horror flick is 28 Days Later, see that one instead."
1,horrible,"this movie has bad acting, bad script, uninspired freddy and jason, and makes no sense whatsoever. as a fan of jason part 3, i am ashamed to call myself a fan of freddy or jason now. the scriptwriter could not write to save his life and once again i thought this belonged in the comedy section. dont waste your money on this."
5,have not seen it but cant wait,OH U BETTER BELIEVE IT IS GOING TO BE AN AWESOME MOVIE JASON AND FREEDY ARE GOING TO TEAR IT UP. BUT I WISH IT WOULD OF BEEN MICHAEL MEYERS AND JASON INSTEAD. I HOPE THERE IS A LOT OF SLASHING IN THIS FLICK. THE ONE THING I DO NOT LIKE IS THAT THEY GOT KELLY ROWLAND IN THAT MOVIE. RAPPERS AND R&B ARTIST HAVE NO BUSINESS IN HORROR MOVIES...BUT HEY I HOPE THIS MOVIE TEARS IT UP.
1,Superman would kill both of these boneheads,"Freddy and Jason would NEVER stand a chance against The Man Of Steel.They're killing spree would come to an ultimate end,if either of these child killing goons ever met up with HIM.They like to pick on children in their dreams and kill innocent teenagers,who just wanna have fun and a good time,but let's see what kind of courage they got when they go up against Superman ha ha ha...not so scary anymore,are ya boys?"
2,Low budget,Why was this movie low budget ? I cant understand it. Is the producer corrupt and the director stupid ? They have to be!...cause this could have been a great movie and a big sucess.Instead it became stupid and lame with no real scary moments or interesting meetings between two giants..Maybe the second one will be better

2,Meh...,"After being pounded with countless pointless horror movies, I thought Freddy VS Jason would erase all of that. It had a certain mystique that made it seem as if it would revolutionize horror movies and make them enjoyable once again, and not just gore-a-thons. Boy, was I wrong. After the first 15 minutes of this film all my hopes are erased, and I'm treated to another gorefest, with no sense of direction. The only reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the final showdown between Freddy and Jason, which is quite the eyecathcer."
3,good but not great,It was a good dvd and i say you dhould by it because it has alot of action and the special effects are great. But it is just not scary. It is more funny than anything. I just didnt really like the ending and i think they should of kept some of the deleted scenes in the movie to make it alittle better and i would have given it 4 stars but i give it 3.
3,Awful,"Freddy Krueger had been forgotten by the kids on Elm Street because their parents found a way to make the kids forget about him by giving them a dream suppressant. In order to inspire terror, Freddy manipulates hockey masked serial killer Jason Voorhees through visions of his mother to go to Elm Street and dispatch the kids so the town will think that Freddy has returned. But his plans don't go according to schedule when Jason starts to kill all of his ""children,"" which really angers Freddy. It's up to teens Will Rollins (Jason Ritter), Lori Campbell (Monica Keena) and Kia (Kelly Rowland), along with a few other survivors, to get Jason back to Camp Crystal Lake and Freddy out of the dream world for both of them to kill each other once and for all. What a disappointment. I'm glad I didn't pay $10 to go see this in the theatre. I have always been a Nightmare on Elm Street fan but this was awful!"
5,incridible,"for the past 10 years, i have been waiting for this moment. and i have to say that i wasn't dissapointed. finally, the force of evil face each other, as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees finally met. its an fantastic movie who will please every single fan of the friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street. another good point is the cool performence made by former destinys child kelly rowland.and theres a lot of cool extra on the dvd, including the trailer for the texas chainsaw massacre!! 5 stars are not enough for it!! buy it now!!"
4,A fun enjoyable movie,I thought this movie was a great addition to both series in my opinion. If you want to watch this movie for a strong plot and story then you need to avoid this. It has a good story to it and just like the other movies it has it's cheesy moments. A lot of blood is shed. There is some great kills in this movie. Kelly Rowland wasn't as annoying as I thought she would be. I actually laughed at her a few times. Jason Ritter did a good job and was probably the only non-annoying character in the movie. The movie does have a lot of laughs as well. The dvd has some great extras too. The alternate ending was stale and liked the one we saw in theatres. So I think anyone who wants to watch a fast paced movie with lots of blood and laughs then get this.
4,Not a bad movie.,freddy rules!I remember growing up and being afraid of freddy.Jason on the other hand never scared me to much.He was just a big dummy who walked slow.Now watching the end of the movie how can anyone say jason won?Jason went down in the water and never came back till the end.freddy survived only to be killed by the teenagers them selves by slicing off his head.freedy won!but anyway its not a bad movie .freddys make up looks great and glad to see him on the silver screen again.
3,Finally,The did they put two horror icons together Freddy Vs. jason. The movie was slow and hard to watch. one the real killing started it was a fun movie. Although Freddy was not really a killer more like a murderer since he killed 1 count 'em one person and Jason had like 10 or 11. The fight between these two was the most exciting part of it. Ofcourse when you have Ronny Yu directing you will have a lot of blood (ie. Bride Of Chucky. I would recoommednd this movie to hardcore Jason and Freddy fans not the casual fans cuz the movie is long and slow at times.
5,Can't Wait For This DVD,"Since this came to theathres in August, I could not wait to own it on DVD! Hopefully, New Line will put a whole lot of extras on this DVD! The fans woudl surely appriciate that! This has to be one of the most anticipated DVDs of 2004! I'm sure within the first week this movie hits stores, it will destroy all sales for almost any other movie! This was one of the best horros movies in ages, and the writer did a great job and combining these massive titans into one movie! This will definatly be a long awaited DVD and a great DVD at that. I can't wait for it!!!"
3,Pretty good..,"This is one of the better horror/comedy movies that hascome out in a long while. You may say that isn't say allthat much when you consider the late 90 ""Horror"" movieslike ""Scream"" and ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer""but it's actually pretty entertaining. Freddy had a fewgood one liners in this movie that is sure to make youlaugh and Jason kills plenty of idiotic teens as always.The fight between the two is alittle unrealistic, butit's entertaining all the same. At a certain point inthe movie it's like the teens get in the way more thanproviding the entertainment. It also tends to leantoward the action movie genre as it goes along. Overall,it's a decent movie that will do just fine on a weekendnight as long as you aren't expecting a movie that willbring the horror genre back to life."
4,pretty good,"this is a fun movie to watch, it acturally feels more like a Nightmare on Elm Street movie with a guest apearence from Jason, cause the movie is mostly based around Freddy, which is a good thing cause Jason is a stooge"
4,Great film......bad ending,Freddy vs jason to most people is a horror masterpiece.Though the film is very violent with horny misfortunestennagers lurking around from the 2 maniacs I have to say theending dissapointed me very much. I wanted to see them fight to the finish! Not some frightend youg women kill em....I heard there will be a sequal.Over all the movie kicks a$$ and I loved the way jasons close desighn was. He rules!If you wanna see alota gore and hack and slash this is the right film for you. Later
5,''A Nightmare On Friday The 13th'',"This is the best slasher film of 2003 it has everything horror,comedy,fantasy,action,sci-fi,...,nudity,drugs,and gore.My favorite line from Freddy was ''How sweet dark meat'' when he said it to Kia[Kelly Rowland]...By the way ''Freddy v.s. Jason'' is rated R for strong graphic horror violence/gore,gruesom images,sexuality,drug use,and language."
5,Awesome flick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this movie. It was great. Its about freddy ressurecting Jason, so Jason will go elm st. & kill the kids so Freddy will be feared again. That way, Freddy can can once again enter the kids' dreams. but soon Freddy realises Jason is killing all the kids & Freddy doesnt get the chance to kill anyody himself. So he tries to get rid of Jason by killig Him first.This film is action packed. A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!!!! Ignore others who hate it cuz it is a good movie to watch."
1,THIS DVD SUCKED,"FIRST OF ALL IF YOU LIKE FREDDY OR JASON IN THE NEW MILLENIUM, YOU NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP, SECOND, ARE THEY EVER SCARY? PLEASE. THE WORST MOVIE EVER PERIOD!!! AND YOU SEE THE ACTION SCENES, LOOKED SO FAKE!!! HAHA NICE JOB AGAIN FOR TRYING TO MAKE A GOOD SCARY MOVIE. HERES A THOUGHT, TAKE MORE THAN TWO WEEKS TO MAKE A MOVIE!!!! DUMB DUMB DUMB"
5,"true brutal, everything to enjoy","Was a true work of art, i hope there is gonna be a game! This movie is true brutal, the epic clash of villany i needed! Look a know it says lazy gamer because i usally sit around playing games on the ps2, but thats not entierly accurate. I LOVE HORROR MOVIES!!! as you sat in your chair, you could feel freddy's claws run up and down your face, and jason machette peirce your skin.if you haven't seen it, get off you lazy [keister]and see it. It was kinda funny really, freddy kept calling his victims a b****, funny but so coldly annoying."
3,freddy vs jason...what a thrill,"Overall Grade: BStory: BActing: CDirection: BVisuals: Bfreddy VS jason...what a thrillby goodluckm31 (movies profile) Nov 4, 2003I actually watched the film only last night early november.The actual opening scene was ok,with bad and poor acting,silly lines but some great effects,blood,blood blood,,,I love it,The fact tha jason is scared of water,,,COME ON...PLEASE...AS IF..Jason fears nothing...I loved the comeback of jasons mother and the fact that she looked mean as ever...Freddy..was as usual funny and great...i liked the fight scene in the boiler room that was fab...BUT pls freddy looked different in this make-up...or was it just me thinking this way?Well i quess a sequel will follow and..THIS IS INPORTANT,,,NOBODY DOES A BETTER JASON THAN KANE HODDER,,,BRING HIM BACK"
4,One of the Best Freddy Films in Years,"Finally! After much time, and many installments in both the Nightmare on Elm St. and Friday the 13th series, the fued has come. Recent Jason films have been given more thought than the Freddy films which steadily lost steam around the third movie. This was the breath of life that Freddy needed (Although, I must admit, I am more of a Jason fan myself!) I this film we see Freddy return as more of a frightening slasher than a killer comedian. Initially, the humor failed to satisfy me as I felt Freddy should have been more of a silent killer such as Jason or Michael Myers. As his films became more comedy than scary, I lost interest. Jason, of course, after his trips to hell and to outerspace returns once again in his terrifying form. I was overall reletively pleased withi this film, the acting, the suspense, and the atmosphere. I give this film 4 stars, and highly recommend checking it out!"
2,Give me a break!,"Puh-lease. This movie wasn't even that scary. It's true that Freddy had the scarist movie, but in the real world Jason could kick his [backside]! For instance, Jason is about a whole feet taller and much stronger than Freddy and Jason doesn't give up, unlike Freddy. I think that the movie could have been more exciting if it was Jason vs. Michael Myers, or Jason vs. The Creep. GO JASON GO!!!"
3,Ok But Just Another Slasher Movie,"If you ask me they should have made this before ""Jason X"" because at the end of ""Jason goes to Hell"" Freddy's Hand comes up and grabs Jason's mask which sets this up. But then they made up that ridiculous story about Jason being in space this is good but should have killed off both of them or at least Freddy. I wish that Michael Myers ""Who is my Favorite"" could have showed up somewhere in the movie as a main character then this movie would have got 5 stars"
5,"Oh no, not another nightmare!",This isnt a review for Freddy vs Jason. I hear rumors they're plannig to film A Nightmare on Elm Street 7! WHY!?! You may not belive me but its almost official. I cant belive theyre gonna make another nightmare on elm street thats stupid.
1,The scary movie,"This movie is so scary. This movie should be only for people ages 18 and up which means it should be rated NC-17. This movie is rated R for perasive strong horror violence/gore, gruesome images, sexuality, drug use and language.- Cristian Mojica"
1,King kong vs. Godzilla All Over Again,"I have about had it with Freddy Vs. Jason. Come on! How many more damn times you guys have to watch a guy in suite who will not die and wtach him kill stupid teenagers over and over and over and over and over nad over....To make the movie better they should have CHucky make a cameo! Okay The First Nightmare on Elm Street was great, and Friday the 13th was okay! But It has gotten to the point where the movies are plan stupid and their is no point for the past decade! I can understand it may be fu nto watch but to keep seeing these two do the same thing over and over will loose its luster!"
4,Better than Lord of the Rings!,"Now this was action packed and entertaining, unlike that boring overlong movie Lord of the Rings. Freddy vs. Jason is a total gorefest. The battle scenes are brutal and bloody. The story that brings Freddy and Jason together worked well, which was a surprise. Who wins? Well you'll have to see the movie to find out. This new movie really makes you want to watch all the classic ""Nightmare on elm st."", and ""Friday the 13th"" movies again. I like this movie, you will too."
3,Birthday present for an 11 y/o,"My friends son has wanted to watch Freddy for awhile, so w/ his moms approval i got it for his B-Day. He loves it and i am the only one that would watch it w/ him. I think they are tcheesy movies but what do i know im not eleven!"
2,Not Your Classic Horror,"This is not your classic horror, or that great of a film. If you like Robert England and are looking for a good laugh than this is your movie if not, then don't buy or rent."
1,FREDDY AND JASON ARE NOW DUMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IF YOU GREW UP W/ FREDDY AND OR JASON DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! IF YOU DID NOT GROW UP W/, THEM THEN SPEND YOUR PARNTS $ TO SEE THIS ONE. The only good part was the music. TO ALL THE 30 AND MID 20 SOMES I SAY LET US KILL BOTH NOW, BEFOR FREDDY VS JASON 2 IS OUT!!!!"
3,blah,"It's a descent flick, but I was really hopping for something better. This movie had too much plot and people running around screaming. I wanted more of Freddy and Jason just going at it together, more random blood and violence and killing. I was exspecting a huge blood bath, but left the theater feeling entertained, but dissapointed."
2,this movie licks lee,"there are some babes but thats it. there are also cool killing seens but the plot blows, and theres no winner. .alot of people in the audience look pissed"
1,You'll All Be Singing A Different Tune...,"When this movie does get released. Come on people, this is going to be such a waste of time. Sequels, let alone a pairing of them, is so ridiculous. You'll have to pay me to see this load of garbage, and come to think about this, I wouldn't even go if you gave me free movie passes for the rest of my family's life... which means my children, my childrens children, etc...Thumbs so far down, past the core of the earth."
1,TERRIBLE AND EVEN MORE TERRIBLE.,"Freddy Vs Jason a film which was talked about for ages finally got its movie release. Problem with movie directors today is they are lost with ideas for horror, either they make a completing silly movie or copy a old classic. I was actually looking forward to seeing this film as I thought ok well it's something different, unfortunately it failed to prove itself as a classic.The film itself acts more like a Freddy movie then a Jason, more blood and gore as usual, also there is a number of critical errors with the film. For example Jason throws a bloke like a mile up into the air but when it comes to getting the knife out of the table he can't. Hopefully they won't make a sequel to this but when it comes to horror who knows. If you love a horror with suspense and terror then Freddy VS Jason should be left out of the choice."
5,IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT,OK I KNOW THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THESE TWO GREAT VILLANS TO DOOK IT OUT ON THE BOG SCREEN. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FILMS SINCE THE 3 SCREAM MOVIES VERY WELL DONE THE CAST WAS THE BEST. AND I HEARD THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SECOND ONE BUT THEY HAVE TO WAIT UNTILL THE SCRIPT IS GREAT THAT IS WHY WE HAD TO WAIT SOOOOOOOOOOO LONG FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT. ALSO I RIGHT GOOD REVIEW ON MOVIES AND E-MAIL THEY TO PEOPLE SO HERE IS ME E-MAIL BUFFYERIK@AOL.COM
4,WHO WINS?,"I was surprised that this movie was so suspenseful, especially when you know what Jason and Freddy will do. All along, I was rooting for Jason and knew he'd win in the end."
5,Scary not so much,"Scary...not really, entertaining...hell yeah. While Freddy Vs Jason isn't 'screaming your head off scary' it makes up in action and humor. What's nice is it is humorous, without being ridiculous. The jokes are well placed and nicely timed. The fighting scenes with Freddy and Jason will have you on the edge of your seat and taking sides. The basic synopsis... Freddy needs Jason; Freddy no longer needs Jason; Freddy wants to get rid of Jason; Freddy vs Jason. Plus some teenagers in the middle. There's a nice cliff-hanger at the end, so maybe a sequel?"
3,"""Good, But Long-Waited Horror Match-Up!""","Robert Englund, Monica Keena, Jason Ritter and Ken Kerzingerstar in this 2003 horror film. Slashers, Freddy Krueger and JasonVoorhees return to the world becoming enemies. This is a good,but long-waited film. It's great to finally see Freddy and Jasontogether and this dvd set has nice picture and sound plus neatextras. I recommend this for your horror collection."
3,"Exactly what I expected, save one surprise","Freddy has his one line zingers. Jason has his machete doing some slicing and dicing. Then they have a battle royale. Lots of blood. Occasional topless shot. No surprises here.Should the movie have been made? I don't see the harm in it. It certainly doesn't measure up to the early Nightmares and 13th's, but taken out of that context it can stand alone as a guilty pleasure.However, the DD 5.1 soundtrack on the New Line DVD is AWESOME.Freddy vs. Jason (New Line Platinum Series)The ambient sound from the rear channel was intense. There is a scene where a character is running through a corn field and the sound puts you right in it with him."
4,The most violent film in 30 years...,"...So says a parental watchdog group at the tail end of 2005. Rated on sheer number of violent acts committed in it. If that doesn't sell you, nothing will. The funny thing about this movie is that many of the Freddy fans thought it was too much about Jason. While Jason fans thought it was too much about Freddy. It can't be both now can it. I personally don't consider myself a fan of either. I think the whole slasher genre is tired myself, but I did like this one. I found the way they played the two off one another rather clever. Of course, clever is kind of a waste on many horror fans. You show them something clever they think it's stupid because they just don't get it. So for those who get it, thumbs up."
4,Four stars for the lack of real fright and scares...BUT..,"Saw it opening day. Long awaited and scrutinized by every horror/slasher fan in the world. I can't say enough about this film.For the gore-hounds out there...much blood is spilled, alot of blood.For the horror-humour fans...more than enough frightful humour and one liners from victims and FREDDY!!! Of course we all know Jason doesn't talk, he just swings his machete...alot.Plus really cool real time and dream time fight scenes and fright scenes.Not scary...more an action/horror movie...but well worth the price of admission...Now if you haven't seen it yet...quit reading and GO!!!!"
5,A CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is better than all of the Freddy and Jason movies put together. Freddy and Jason in the same movie makes this a classic for years to come. In this movie, Freddy needs people to fear so he can haunt them in their dreams. Freddy uses Jason to kill people to bring fear in them until Freddy gets stronger. But something goes wrong with the plan. When Freddy gets strong, Jason keeps on killing people. So now Freddy and Jason start fighting until one of them dies. Whoever wins kills everybody. I didn't think this movie was going to be this good because the last Jason movie, Jason X, was stupid and wasn't scary. If you like both Freddy and Jason movies, you'll definitely love this movie, I guarantee it."
1,Dumb Meets Dumber,"As I watched this movie unfurl, I seriously wondered if the creators were doing a rip-off of ""Scary Movie,"" which I really enjoyed. But noooooo. You've got the usual teens doing stupid things like the guy who hears something outside his house and goes out there in the dark yelling, ""Is somebody there?...Hello, is somebody out there?"" Then you had the stupid young girl who strips naked and dives into water because she's certain her boyfriend will follow. Naturally, the killer comes after her and...this was such a horrible waste of disc and talent. after 45 minutes, I finally had to call it quits. I loved the Nightmare series but in this horrible botched up junk, Freddie goes out with a burp instead of a bang."
2,FREDDY VRS JASON.......an idea since 1985...,"Huge fan of both films, grew up with the two.Unfortunatly all of us have gone on and grown up. The new generation of kids heading to this flick will find anything good.I was very disapointed but expected it. The acting made me want to scream...it was so horrible. Freddy is ruthless, Jason slaughters all in sight...and of coarse the ending is loosely left for a sequel. So much for the great battle. Craven should of done this. If you like mindless gore, go see it. But even if you are a huge fan and grew up witht hese deadly guys, the battle is something we've been waiting for. So check it out, for laughs and to rekindle some old memories of when we WERE scared!"
5,THESE HORROR LEGENDS FINALLY DO BATTLE.,"This movie will only be appreciated by true fans of both series.This movie was alot of fun to see because it had lots of action,gore,nudity and harsh language.The acting wasnt the best but all these type of movies are intended to have cheesy acting.The story was good and freddy was more serious and not as goofy as he has been in the past.Jason was truly menacing and the 2 fights in the movie is reason enough to purchase this movie.GO OUT AND GET THIS TODAY YOU SICK FREAKS!!!"
5,Fun DVD!,Lots of great extras really make this disc a must own. I especially enjoyed the Bally's Casino weigh-in between the 2 movie maniacs! Freddy really trash talks while Jason uses his huge physical appearance in a funny way. The film itself is pretty amazing and teh last 30 minutes or so make sitting through the Dawson style beginning worth it.
4,WHO WILL WIN FREDDY OR JASON,"THIS MOVIE ISN'T REALLY SCARY BUT IT HAS A PRETTY GOOD AMOUNT OF ACTION BUT IT NEEDS A LIL' BIT MORE BLOOD AND GORE. THIS MOVIE TOOK PLACE IN VANCOUVER,CANADA. THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT 2 OF THE MOST POPULAR HORROR KILLERS EVER. THE MOVIE STARTS OUT WHEN FREDDY HAS TO WAKE JASON UP TO GO TO ELM STREET AND START KILLING PEOPLE SO THAT THEY THINK IT IS FREDDY BECAUSE FREDDY IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH BUT THEN THEY THINK THAT FREDDY IS BACK SO THEY START DREAMING ABOUT HIM AND THEN HE GETS STRONG ENOUGH BUT NOW HE HAS GOT A PROBLEM HE HAS TO FIND OUT HOW TO TAKE JASON DOWN SO HE GOES TO THE ONLY PLACE TO KILL HIM CRYSTAL, LAKE.... THAT IS ALL I WILL SAY DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT ALL AWAYFREDDY- THE ONLY THING TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF"
3,A pretty good movie,"First of all if this is going to be the first friday the 13th or A Nightmare on elm street movie you are going to see STOP! Go to your local video store and rent a couple of the other movies,so you will understand this one more. But otherwise a good movie. If you like allot of gore in horror films this has plenty of it i give it a 3 and a half."
1,Absolutely Horrible!!!!!,"This long awaited confrontation between the preeminent horror icons of the 1980s is an incredible disappointment. The director uses blood and gore in a failed effort to substitute for suspense and terror. The story is a sad effort, even by the standards of the two movie chains this poor excuse for a movie is supposed to be paying tribute to. I mean, for heaven's sake, since when does a forty year old zombie corpse (Jason) bleed?! Even Freddy's usual cleverness and creativity are lacking, once again buried under a load of gore that even fails to create disgust with anything besides this garbage excuse for a horror film. Bad acting, bad story, bad directing, bad EVERYTHING!!!!!!Save your money and pass. In fact, when this one finally makes its way to cable, PASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good flick but shouldve been better,I've always been a huge fan a Friday the 13th and Nightmare. So when this movie came out I was looking forward to see it. This film got some good parts were it brings the characters back to the roots of their past movies but it just seemed that too much was missing. This isnt really a bad movie but being a fan for years it just shouldve been better.
3,"1, 2 Freddy's coming for you...","This movie was nice and gory, with a bunch of funny 'death' scenes, but it was a bit tame from what i expected in a 2003 movie.The story, never a strong part in these movies, was a bit of a wish wash and the fight in the end was cool, but predictably a draw. I mean, how can you lose when you both cant die?This was a good movie, in what could be the last one made for both icons, but it is far from the best horror has to offer."
3,Freddy vs. Jason,"I did think the movie was kind of interesting..however, I didn't think it was scary enough. I was expecting a lot more and got much less."
3,Freddy vs. Jason,"Finally after years of waiting, the movie came out. Me being a Freddy fan I was in his corner. It was an interesting movie. If you like both, then you probably won't care who does what to whom. If you are a big Jason fan, you will enjoy it, if you are a Freddy fan you will enjoy it. I loved the gore!!! What's a horror movie without some gore!!!!Maybe they can do a Michael Myers vs. Jason next?"
3,Decent,"A decent flick, with all of the prerequisite sadistic, twisted deaths of teenagers and warped humor throught. Those nostalgic for the glory (gory?) days of the'80's horror films should not be disappointed. Everything you loved about the Friday the 13th and Elm Street movies is here.The plot is actuall better than one would aspect for a mainstream slasher flick. I won't spoil it here, but how they make the two movie series gel with each other is logical and satisfying. there are some plotholes (why would you go to a rave a day after two of your friends were brutally murdered?) but that can be quickl cast aside. The action is what you want to see, and it is i abundance.Watching Freddy and Jason duke it out is a marvel to see. Whil i am not sure how fans reacted overall to the ending (it was s copout, i thought) but it was the getting there that was the most fun. This is a movie wel worth seeing for horror fans."
3,This is for the fans...,"Call me silly - I know this movie got mostly bad reviews from the major critics, but I enjoyed it. It is the first movie in forever that is in the tradition of the old Universal Monster Movies like Frankenstien vs. The Wolf Man. It was a diverting theatergoing experience and I felt that I got my money's worth."
1,"Seven,8 don't stay up late...","Not for this hogwash.Really now!!First of all no one wins.What kind of a battle is that??The graphics are so so (And that's all I rented the video for)The storyline?Hmmm...very interesting.The acting is very bland and looks like your 3rd grader's nativity play. All in all, if I could give this a zero rating I would. Lucky enough(Used very loosely) I had rented this crapfest. A total miss."
3,Where's Jason's face?,"Anyone know where the scene showing Jason's face is? It was supposed to be on the DVD, but I don't see it. Anyway, the movie was okay."
3,Tall Tales,Cute little take on the Cantabury Tales from the Duke point of view. This book is only for lovers of all things Duke.
2,Not at all the same,"If you liked the sound of Letters To Cleo on ""Ten things I hate about you"" then you probably wont like this CD. Kay (lead singer) sounds a lot different and nothing like she does in 10 things. If you want a CD by Letters To Cleo, I recamend GO! It's WAY better because its more recent and she sounds just like in 10 things. =)"
5,This Is The Best CD!,ok so I heard LTC in 10 things i hate about you and i'm like omigod i have to find out who this is. so i came here and found Sister and i listened to some samples and i bought it and when it came i listened to the song Sister and You Dirty Rat like a million times. i LOVE it i'm working on my mom to get me their other cds!
5,Nice Harness,This is a nice little harness. Easy to use and convenient. I can snap my puppy in and keep her where she needs to stay while traveling and she still has enough freedom to be comfortable. I have also lengthened the tether and used it as a leash in a pinch when I have forgotten my puppy's real leash.
2,Safety of this design is dubious,"I bought 2 of these as I have 2 dogs. It works great at keeping them from getting crazy in the back seat. Problem is: the D-ring on the back of the harness is not welded. I found out when taking my dogs to the dog park and used the harness to walk them. One of them weighing in at 51 lbs. took off after a bird, hit the end of the leash and popped the D-ring off the harness. As a safety item it should be welded. So don't expect it to stop your dog from flying forward should you have the bad luck of getting in a car wreck."
4,"Good, but","This is an excellent read, in the main, but why has one of the editors (Ehteshami) claimed on his website (Durham University) that this book is his own authored book? This demeans the efforts of the actual contributors and should be addressed."
5,Great gift for a godzilla fan,I bought this for my nephew Christmas last year and he loved it! He loved it so much he is asking for more this year. It was also very fast shipping!
2,Try Bobby instead,"I bought Mel Torme's ""Sunday in New York"" album because I was looking for a good version of that tune for ballroom dancing.I also bought ""The Magic of Bobby Darin"" which has an (arguably) better version of ""Sunday in NY"" but also a great rendition of ""Oh! Look at Me Now"". I recommend the Bobby Darin albumMagic of Bobby Darinover the Mel Torme album, or buy both and make your own decision."
1,Don't buy it,"The spanish language is only one, if it is in the Royal Academy Of The Spanish Language then you can consider you speak spanish, if not, dictionaries like this one are just [weak]."
3,"Cubanish Maybe, But Definitely Not Spanglish","This book really shouldn't have been called 'The Official Spanglish Dictionary.' It's Cuban-influenced Spanglish, and while the lingo in this book may be heard on the East Coast, West Coast 'Spanglish' is entirely different. Most of the Spanglish heard in the mainstream media is West Coast, and this book contains none of those phrases.A person interested in casual Spanglish would be very disappointed if they bought this book expecting Mexican-Americanisms and instead found they'd bought a book full of Cuban-Americanisms.Blumers? Every Mexican-American I know calls them 'chonies.' The West Coast Spanglish seems less formal in all aspects than the Cuban-influenced Spanglish featured in this book."
3,Spanglish,This was an entertaining book but was so specific to Cuban/Miami Spanish that it wasn't much of a help for a Californian.
2,Save your money,This book is not well organized. Save your money and the information is not up-to-dated.
3,originaliy,If I were not a scrapbook enthusiast then I would really like this book. But I am. And I own all kinds of scrapbooking books. I'm not saying I'm an expert but I have educated myself enough.This book by Amber is good for beginners and for those who don't have other scrapbooking books. But it lacks originality and most of her layout can be found in creative memories.
5,A must-have resource for scrapbookers of all levels!,"I just love this book! Not only does the author share numerous pages of her own scrapbook, she provides a list of exactly what the reader needs to duplicate that look. A shopping list like that is so handy! The scrapbook pages in this how-to guide have such varied themes and layouts that they inspire me when my own creativity needs a boost. This book would make a great gift, too."
3,Overall disappointment,"The balance is quite negative.Although a lot of info is spoken in this CD, you will rarely hear the artist's voice..."
3,Balance disc is OK,"I purchased this to relieve stress when I sit for long times in front of my computer. It works OK, but seems to be too thick for this purpose. I use it sometimes but it doesn't work as well as I had envisioned."
3,Satellite Technology: An Introduction,"A useful text for those who need to know more about the user technology (ground) in sat-comms. It's a little dated and with a decidedly USA-centric bias but its relatively small size and friendly style more than compensate.It's not really of use to those who need to know about the satellites themselves, much of what is said can be found in far more detail although in decidedly more expensive texts.Its real plus is that you can learn an awful lot if you read the whole thing and you can do that in a weekend. You can't say that about Messrs Marel et al!"
3,Too hot for chocolate,I know it's probably my fault for ordering chocolate in the middle of summer but I thought they would at least pack it dry ice our a cold pack of some kind. By the time I got it I got 48 pieces of melted balls of chocolate. It was still yummy but messy as all get out.
4,Nice band - nice record..,"If you`re already a fan of alternative country music and indierock, you will probably like this album. The songs makes me think of several related bands and artists like; The Handsome Family, Lambchop, Calexico, Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Lee Hazelwood & Nancy Sinatra. It`s a diversified album with its own distinctive sound, well-produced, with many nice songs, which immediately brings me in a good mood when I listen to them. Blanche is really a band to fall in love with, as someone mentioned earlier.So I`ve already become a huge fan of this album, despite some mediocre songs, which is the reason I gave 4,5 and not 5 stars. In my opinion, the strongest and most catchy tunes are: ""I`m sure of it"", ""Last year`s leaves"", ""No matter where you go"", ""Little amber bottles"" and ""World I used to be afraid of"". Briefly spoken, this is a strong record from a skilful band. Highly recommended!"
3,"Chailly chooses a multi-voiced approach, with mixed results","Despite the typically gorgeous sonics that Decca gets with the Concertgebouw, this is a negligible CD artistically. There was no reason to parse out Mahler's Wunerhorn songs to multiple singers, but if you do, they had all better be exceptional to compensate for breaking apart the dramatic dialogue between the usual two singers. That's not the case here. Even Goerne and Bonney, the two best participants, can't compete with great Mahler singers of the past, and the others are fair-to-middling at best. Chailly conducts with his usual caution. All in all, I see no reason for one to keep this CD. I certainly didn't."
5,Works great!,I use prime to fix the city water prior to water changes. It works perfectly every time by bringing the ammonia levels down.
3,stinks of your house,"This stuff apparently has great reviews and it seems to work. i did have a few fish die in some of my tanks since using it. perhaps it shocked them.the problem i have with it is the salts in the prime give off a rotten egg smell. i have 7 tanks, but they are 10 gallons or less. my entire house stinks like rotten eggs now and there's no way to get rid of the smell.the human nose can detect this smell better than anything, that's why they add it to natural gas.any method to mask the smell just ends up being smell+rotten eggs."
2,Errors and biases,"What could have been a change-making ethnography is instead an error filled and one sided rant. Barker makes several glaring factual errors that a good editor should have caught, not the readers. She is so clearly biased in favor of the Marshallese (who admittedly were wronged) that she fails to present both sides of the issues and history and she turns readers against her positions in the process. Many important points lose their impact when she lectures us over and over again on what the 'evil' US government ought to give the Marshall Islanders as restitution. Her great knowledge of a unique and interesting people is lost in the political rhetoric. Not a well balanced ethnography."
4,Great Mystery & Love Story,"Even though the outcome was predictable, I loved this book. It's amazing what true love and passion can accomplish. I liked the ending especially after the main characters suffered so much and for so many years. Once again, Beverly Barton has written an excellent, kick-ass novel that will keep you coming back for more!"
2,Reads Like A Category Romance,"I should have looked at the copyright and noticed that this was originally published in 2004. Of course, even then I probably wouldn't have paid much attention since I've loved all the stuff I've read of hers and that was only a few years ago, after all. But this doesn't read like most of Barton's stuff at all. It reads like an old Harlequin category romance or Silhouette Romantic Suspense. [Edited to add: it looks as if this *was* Harlequin SuperRomance or the like.]Completely unbelievable coincidences drive the story, which is full of angst and ""oh woe is me"". If you simply must own everything Barton has written, go for it, but if you're not a fan of that kind of thing, skip this one. It was so trite and silly I couldn't finish it. I gave it two stars instead of one because the writing itself is competent, and I reserve one-star ratings for those books which are grossly badly written."
5,Worth Dying For,One of the best book that Beverly Barton has written. I am always waiting for her next book!
3,Easy read romance,"It was good in the beginning then it was if it had no depth of emotion and character, too predictable. It was as if instead of experiencing the story you were just looking at it from afar"
2,Didn't keep my interest!,This is one of those books that I couldn't wait to finish so I could start another one that was better. Started out slow and failed to ever catch my interest!
5,"""Must"" reading for those returning to school from an absence","Now in an updated and expanded fourth edition, The Adult Student's Guide To Survival And Success shows the adult learner how to overcome fears, study and pass tests, get financial help, gain family support, balance work and college, create a portfolio, be resilient and adaptable, use Internet resource, achieve educational and technical proficiency.

The Adult Student's Guide To Survival And Success is ""must"" reading for anyone returning to school after a prolonged absence due to parenthood, career changes, or retirement."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting something a little more substantial, like actual suggestions on how to make it in college with my 3 young kids, but what I got was at best, rudimentary advice on how to apply for a loan. I would recommend another book instead."
4,Very helpful,Definitely helps you get yourself pointed in the right direction. My only complaint is some bad links on the webpages recommended.
1,Missing a little something,Missing cable and power supply. Hard to testify to quality when there's not enough there to work. Save your money. Wish I had.
4,A must have for any nursery,"The Diaper Dekor is excellent and does the job well. My newborn's diapers easily drop into the Dekor with just a step of the pedal. Once the Dekor is full, the bag is easily removed and cut to just the right length which means no bag is wasted. The bag has a nice scent which isn't overpowering. The bags have proven to be durable and strong to support the weight of the diapers. My nursery has been smell free from diaper odor because of the Dekor Plus Diaper System. My only complaint would be that I wish it was bigger (it's smaller than a standard trash can)."
1,the dekor tinks up my baby's room,"I have also read great reviews about the diaper dekor while I was pregnant and decided to get it, but it is terrible, whenever I put a diaper in there and the lid opens up the smell of poop comes out and into the room, we coulnt take it anymore the fact that the nursery smelled like poop most of the time even though I changed the bag way before it was time to. Now I take the poopy diaper, put it in a plastic bag and throw it in the kitcken garbage which we take out almost twice a day. I would not recommend this product"
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This Diaper Dekor does not do what it is suppossed to do. First of all, the bags are so thin and it holds so many diapers that the bags rip when it is time to change it. Speaking of which, try to change the bag, it is impossible!!!!!!! There aren't any instructions on how to change the bag, and then I finally figured it out, and the bags did not fit properly. Save your money and use your kitchen garbage, it is much easier!!!"
1,Still smells,"I used this only for 3 days. The smell is just as strong as using a regular trash can. Also, if you want to throw away something other than a diaper, like a diaper wipe, it doesn't fall through the opening on its own. You have to push it down into the pail, which is not sanitary. Don't waste your money.I had previously tried the Diaper Champ. It does mask the odor a lot better and you can use regular trash bags instead of special ones specific to the diaper pail. The only drawback is that the top gets stuck a lot which isn't something you want to deal with when trying to quickly throw away dirty diapers.We are just going to use a regular trash can with a lid until they make something better."
2,Not very effective,"I have 2 children--a 3-month old and a 3-year old and I find that when there are soiled diapers from the 3-year old, I can smell them a mile away. I usually empty the can every day because I can't stand the smell."
1,"If not for the nice design, no stars at all!","I bought this product because of all the great reviews but I was sadly disapponted. Yes, it's easy to use and looks great, it does not contain the smell at all - the supposed main selling point of the product! Very disappointed with this product - will try Diaper Genie next. Hopefully I'll have a better experience."
1,Not safe for babies,"Once babies can pull up to standing, they can lift the lid and reach inside. Yuck! I added an extra latch but that made using the diaper pail more difficult. Also, it is awkward to use the foot pedal because you have to bend over. The flap doors also started to stick. As my baby's diet advanced, it didn't control odors at all. I switched to the Safety 1st and love it."
2,Not much different than a regular garbage can with lid,"I am not impressed with the Diaper Dekor...I received it as a shower gift with a box of refill liners (cost of refills - $20). Put quite simply...this is a garbage can with a double lid that requires you to purchase special liners. There is nothing wrong with that, but you would be just as well off using a regular trash can with a lid."
3,Little flippy door breaks!,I just bought this for my newborn sons stinky dipers! It works great with the excepton of the fact that the little flippy door breaks really easy... it is supose to flip back up... but when it breaks..it stays down allowing the stinky to get out. But other then that it works great.
5,"This is a nice, easy-to-use diaper disposal","I am a mom of five children, ranging in age from 3 months old to 18 years old and I have had many diaper pails/disposal systems, including the Diaper Genie. The Diaper Dekor Plus is the best one I have ever used by far. (At first, I didn't smell any odor, but now that my child is on formula and her bowel movements smell much worse, I can smell odor whenever the lid is opened. I usually just spray Lysol and the odor clears). The hands-free foot pedal is great too. The opening under the lid has large double doors and you would never have to cram a dirty diaper in there like you do with the Diaper Genie. And changing the bag is very easy. I highly recommend this product and I am so happy I bought it! I wish this would have been available years ago!"
2,Won't make it for the long haul,"I was excited about this diaper pail as I'd heard so many good things about it. However the flip doors in the lid have broken twice (both times a spring seems to be wearing out in the same way). My son is only 16 months old, and I expected to use this diaper pail at least another year. Diaper Dekor has replaced the lid once already, which they did very graciously and expediently. I am going to ask them to replace it again, but am aggravated that I am having to deal with this twice. AND even putting diapers in ziplocs before disposing of them doesn't help this pail contain the smell now that my son is older. I would try another diaper pail if I was buying one again."
4,So far so good,"After reading many reviews on all the diaper systems, I decided to go with this one.Positives were: ease of use, looks good and no major problems.Negatives were: doesn't seem to work well on carpet, diaper doesn't always fall through swinging doors and refills seem pricy.Because it sits on carpet, we have resorted to lifting the whole lid up by hand instead using the foot pedal. For now it's easier with the fact that newborn diapers aren't heavy enough to push through the swinging doors just by ""dropping the diaper in"". I'm hoping this will change with bigger diapers because it still seems like the best diaper disposal system out there."
4,Very handy,"I got this diaper pail soon after my son started on solid foods. It has been very useful and easy to use. I have gotten a couple of unpleasant whiffs, but if you change the bag often, you'll have no problem. To all the parents who gave this negative reviews because of the smell, I'd suggest buying a couple packs of the disposable powder scented bags and a container of Febreze or the Clorox disinfecting spray. They work really well, especially on poopy diapers. I have had no problems with this and would recommend this to any new mother."
4,On par with others,"As a nanny, I have used almost all types of diaper disposal units on the market.I found this one as easy and scent free as all other diaper holders. It stunk only after 6 mos of use, which is common with all others as well, they all work to keep smells out until you begin solids or have had it for several months.GOOD Points: It was hands free and kept bacteria off top where baby could touchIt was easy to change and cleanIt's scent claim was true for several monthsBAD Points: The baby lifted the top and was able to put her hands directly into it.We broke the foot pedal with normal use in 10 mos.It began to smell just like other products with minimal time."
2,Trap door breaks and horrible smell,"I received this off my registry and loved it, but have to agree with the others; it works until the real poop starts. I have an 8 month old, and there is no containing this smell. Even with air fresheners, Lysol, etc its awful. It doesn't help that my springs on the trap door broke, which means it does not contain any smell. We had to move it out into the hallway and finally I have given up and now use doggy poo bags to wrap my dirty diapers in to throw away in out outside can. Much easier. I really wished this would have worked because it was wonderful to just step and throw."
2,Just wait till your kid starts eating table food...stinky!!,"I am not sure how there are reviews on here saying that the odor is contained. This is simply not the case for us. Perhaps when your kid is still on breastmilk or formula. But when he/she really starts eating solids, let me tell you, every time you have to put a dirty diaper in this diaper pail, it will release a very foul odor into your child's room. I am pretty disappointed in this product for that reason alone. Sure, it's easy to use and the refills are simple to insert. But, who cares when your kid's room smells like poop??"
2,dekor diaper-----smelly,"this product does not keep the odor of dirty diapers contained!!!when baby was newborn it was ok, as we all know when baby gets bigger so does diaper odor. with my first baby we had diaper genie it did keep in the odor."
3,"Nice, but NO odor control!","I read all the great reviews on the pail when shopping around and thought I was getting the best diaper pail out there! Every time I change my sons diaper and open the lid to throw it away, the room fills with dirty diaper smell! It's a roomy pail, holds a lot of diapers, is easy to empty and change the refills, but does not help in the ODOR department, at least not when you go to put anything in it! I liked the idea of not having a diaper caterpillar (like the diaper genie produces) and just having a bag to throw away, but i am now seriously considering going out and getting the diaper genie to ""seal out"" the diaper smell!"
3,"Decent diaper pail, but not a great smell container","I must say that we read a variety of positive reviews for the Dekor Plus. We received it as a shower gift and really loved the ease of use, smell containment during the first eight months and simple bag changes. Over the last couple of months (our son is a year old), we found that the Dekor Plus is not as odor proof as we had originally noticed. As the diaper odors get stronger, the Dekor doesn't work as well. We are going to purchase the Diaper Champ which our friends say is the best of the big three (Diaper Genie, Dekor and Diaper Champ)."
1,It STINKS!,"After much research, I decided on the Diaper Dekor Plus and wish I hadn't. Everything I read said it wouldn't stink, but it does!! The baby's room smells aweful all the time and even the upstairs of my house smells. It's a brand new house and my baby is only 7 weeks old so this really shouldn't be an issue. I would suggest everyone to look past this product and choose another one."
2,I would not recommend,"I purchased this product because I had heard and read good reviews however, I must say that I now disagree with all good reviews I had read. This product does not do well in the smell department. The second you open up the dekor to put another dirty diaper in the smell could knock you over. It spreads to the room and leaves a horrible odor in the room. I've tried air fresheners to put in the dekor to help with this issue but I have had no luck. I can't decide to either keep spraying febreeze in my son's room each time I enter or buy the diaper genie."
1,Sucks!!!,"Broke just after the 6th month warranty, so can't get it replaced. Didn't really like it in the first place. Hard to get diapers in when they get anywhere near the top. Piece also broke off within first week of using."
1,STINKS...literally!,"My Diaper Genie broke so I decided to try something new for my 2 year old. This diaper pal is horrible. The bags are not lined like the DG pal or even the Arm&Hammer pal so it stinks! I have to change the bag every other day with only a few diapers in it rather than once a week like I do with the other pal. I plan to replace this pal immediately! I like the design, but the smell is so bad that the nice design doesn't matter."
5,Love It!,I just put in my 4th refill and my daughter turns 6 months old tomrrow. The only time I notice a smell is when I'm on the last part of the bag. This really appealed to me becaue I didn't want to have a separate trash can. Plus my dog that gets into trash cans has shown no interest in the dekor.
2,It stinks!,"This diaper pail really stinks. The problem is that, because it holds so much, the diapers sit in it for a long time. Especially as my daughter is in daycare away from home during the day and so it takes us a long time to fill this pail. When you go to put in another diaper, the stink that wafts out of this diaper dekor would knock you out. The worse part is emptying it. Yikes! I manage to pass that onto my husband most of the time. We ended up moving it out of our daughter's room, away from her changing table which was very inconvenient for us. But we couldn't have her sleeping in such a smelly environment. We have just today bought the diaper genie which is highly recommended by our friends."
5,Love It!,This diaper system works great. I have never smelled any foul odor. It is very easy to use without any twisting.
5,Keeps the smell to itself!,"I love this diaper pail, I have two, one in my identical twin boys room (9 months) and one downstairs. They both really keep the smell at bay. Its super easy to put in a diaper, its like a regular trash bin except it keeps the house smelling so much better. It can hold a good week of dirty diapers and all of their content. I have never had any odor problems, and only spray lysol in it when the bags are changed, and I scrub it every 2 weeks. It is just so nice to not have to fiddle with bags and tops and this and that when changing a diaper, and it seems like thats all I ever do! The refils are kind of difficult to find, but I just bought my 3rd pack since my boys got home, and thats wiht TWINS!! It never lets you get a whiff of that smell until you change the bag. I could not be happier with my system, and I pray for all of you with infants and who dont have this product, its really a must in my book!"
4,works o.k. but broke after 3 months,"this system works better than others, my only complaints are that the trap doors are not stronger, they don't always close and one of them recently broke-it hangs down now, I have not contacted the company about a replacement so I can't say anything about customer service and frankly I think it would probably be easier to just buy a new one, which I plan to do."
5,A MUST BUY!!!!,"I have read all of the reviews on this web page and I don't know what the heck people are talking about, having flies attracted to this diaper pail because it doesn't contain odor??? All I can say is that for us sanitary folks, this is great!!!! It is very easy to change bags, cut the old one out and tie a knot and your done!!! I have a 3 month old who goes through about 6-8 diapers a day and I only have to change the bag 2 times a week. I have no smell at all in the nursery.. I recommend it to everyone!! I've used the Diaper Genie and it sucks compared to this!!!!"
1,"If the purpose is to control diaper smell, then it doesn't work at all.","I admit that my review should really be broken into two parts -- before the biodegradable refill bags and after. Before the new biodegradable refill bags we were perfectly happy with the Dekor Plus. It worked well in controlling smells, was easy to operate, and was simple to change bags. The reason we wanted it was, of course, to control the smells of used diapers. However, Diaper Dekor recently introduced a new refill that is biodegradable. It does not work well in controlling diaper smells. Unfortunately, the biodegradable refills are the only option available. As such, I would recommend another diaper system. Also, I would question wether a biodegradable bag filled with non-biodegradable diapers really serves any benefit."
1,Does not keep the stink in!,"I bought this product based on the reviews I read about a year ago. My daughter is now 11 months old and the entire room STINKS whenever we have to dispose of a soiled diaper! I have to change the bag every time she has a BM. I finally gave up and and bought another Diaper Genie. I had one with my first two children and it may be more of a hassle to use but I do not recall it omitting as much odor as the Diaper Dekor Plus. Save your money, don't buy this product!"
2,"Good at first, but can't handle solid food smells at all.","I loved my Diaper Dekor for the first six months while my son was exclusively breastfed. But once we started solids, it didn't seem to work at all. Now I have to either put dirty daipers in a plastic bag before putting them in the pail, or throw them away somewhere else. I still like the ease of the system, but a trashcan with a lid would be just as easy and work just as well.Also, my 13 month old son can take things out and throw things into the Diaper Dekor by himself. That's great for him to feel like he is helping after his diaper is changed, but it means I can't leave the thing out, which makes it pretty inconvienient to use. Other models I've seen don't have that problem, so in the end, I wish I'd gone with something else."
3,It's just OK.,"I bought the Diaper Dekor when my son was born. For the first few months, this was great. But, recently, it's not so good. The smell is not contained. I find myself changing the bag a few times a week just to get the smell out of his room. My friend has the Diaper Champ which definitely contains the smell. Next time, I will buy that."
3,Great early...,"After reading several reviews for all of the major diaper systems, we went with the Dekor Plus. It was great for the first year as it is VERY easy to use and it contained the smell very well. Now that our son is 16 months old, and the two spring loaded ""doors"" have sprung, it just isn't cutting it any longer.I would guess most diaper systems wear out after the use they receive, but I am now in a conundrum as to whether to buy a new Dekor, buy another system, or buy stock in Lysol until he is ready to be potty trained.Overall, it served its purpose well, I only wish the spring loaded doors would have lasted a few more months."
2,dekor stinks,"Although simple to use, the Diaper Dekor doesn't prevent the smell from escaping especially during the summer months. And then one of the (smell preventing) flaps broke after 13 months. Also, the refills are not that easy to install and are almost as expensive as the Dekor. We just bought the Diaper Champ which uses medium trash bags."
3,Stinky Stinky Stinky,"There needs to be an odor absorber in here because holy moly, this thing stinks. I started putting poopy diapers directly in the trash outside and only use it for pee diapers. I actually sprayed it down with Lysol and left it outside for a day to air out but something about the plastic absorbs the odor and I can't seem to get rid of it."
4,Works great but trap doors are an issue to be aware of,"It does a great job of containing the odor and is easy to operate it. Our son is now two and it is still doing a great job. Some people have mentioned about having problems with the trap doors, and we did as well at around the one year mark. We called customer service and they sent us a new trap door. The lid is getting a little weak now at the two year mark, but we will happily buy a new one for the next bundle of joy, because it has worked so well and we think two years is a reasonable life for a product that sees so much use. It's easy to change the bags, and they are afforably priced."
2,Trap Door Breaks and Does Not Contain the Smell,"For our first two kids we went with the Diaper Genie. Moved to the Dekor with kid three ... the baby's room smells, it does not contain the odor. The lid system is clumsy and the trap door hardly remains closed. With kid four we are now switching to the Diaper Genie 2."
2,Smell comes out,"The smell is not as well contained as they promise, and the refills bags are really too expensive."
2,easy to use but smells leak,"it leaks smells. The baby's room always has a smell. Triple seal? Maybe 3 seals in 3 different places, not 3 layers of protection. I sniffed around--the smell goes right through the bag and leaks out the front door (for changing bags). This door has NO SEAL just the door butting against the case, with a visible gap.Refills are also expensive.Our baby is just on milk. Don't know if anything else is better, but I would look."
5,lots of diapers... little smell,"The people who have complained about the smell they have experienced when emptying the unit obviously forget what it is that they are throwing away. Nothing will make your child's diapers smell like roses after a week of sitting around.... I hated it! I threw it away after a month. I saw the Diaper Dekor while shopping and figured that if it didn't work, I would have use for it as a regular trash can - can't say the same for a Genie. I love this thing! Although it's sad to say that I love a trash can but anything that keeps the odors at bay in your house is easy to love. It's super easy to use, easy to install refills, keeps the smell out of the air!...I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Happy diaper changing to everyone!!! :o)"
3,Just wondering...,How many diapers does this hold? I have read everything and that is the one thing I am really curious about. We are expecting our first child in November and I am trying to research as many products as I can. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!- I only gave 3 stars because I had to rate it and I am still familiarizing myself with the product.
3,Difficult to refill plastic liner,"I would give this a higher rating because it definitely works well...but refilling the plastic liners is a bit complicated. Also, when emptying the bin you have to tie the bottom into a not. It just seems like there are one too many steps."
4,Good Choice,"I was really sad when I realized the diaper champ of four years ago was no more, or at least according to the awful reviews. I went with the dekor system, even though what I dislike is the specialty bag refills. It's a solid diaper disposal system-- keeps the odors in check and that's priority #1. I just wish it held a little more. The trap door swings down to seal out the odor, and it starts to hit the dirty diapers fairly quickly. I've began to make tightly sealed ""diaper torpedos"" for fear of getting debris on the trap door. Other than that, I'd recommend it."
2,"Doesn't control odor, hinges rust","Loved this for first 6 months. Held more than Diaper Genie (I have both). However at about 8 months I noticed that it started to really stink. We clorox it, spray it, clean in constantly - but still reeks. I took apart this week and noticed that the metal springs that hold the door flap ""closed"" were totally rusted out. Thus keeping the flap open all the time. So that's part of the smell - but the whole inside of it just stinks. Diaper Genie better - had same amount of time and no change in smell, etc."
1,Waste of TONS of money!,"I registered for this item based on the reviews from this sight. I am very disappointed. This Diaper Pail STINKS! Literally! Forget poopie diapers, those have to go directly outside to the garbage. Only 2 or 3 slightly soiled can go in before you have to change the bag because your entire house smells. Now, after spending over $100 on refill bags, I wish I would have got the Diaper Champ everyone raves about. In fact, I think I'll go order it now."
3,Stinks but nice looking,"We are now on the third month of life with our little boy and his diapers are getting pretty stinky and so is this diaper disposal pail. Once the diaper is in the pail, it is no longer stinky but when you drop the diaper in, the previous stinky diapers' smell wafts up and out of the pail and into the room. yuck! I guess there is really no full-proof way of avoiding smell. I must say that it is quite nice looking and a much better choice than the Diaper Geenie (as I have experienced with my sister's kids). also, the refills last forever and are pretty inexpensive!"
2,Not for me!,"Sorry to the Diaper Dekkor lovers out there...but this system DOES NOT do it for me! Stinky, doesn't hold many diapers, and a pain in the behind to change the bags. I STILL prefer my Diaper Genie to this thing. I read the reviews before I bought it, and I'm sorry to say they are misleading. My recommendation is DO NOT BUY!!"
4,Worth it,"I received this system along with 2 boxes of refills as a shower gift. I have yet to buy any more refills and my son is FIFTEEN MONTHS OLD. I think I have one refill bag left. It does get stinky occasionally, but, I just put an outlet air freshener in his room and that does the trick. Actually, the only thing that bothers me right now is that my son has discovered that it is fun to open the lid and stick his hand in the chute. Remember, if it's easy for us, it's easy for them. All in all, I very pleased with this product and couldn't imagine using anything else."
5,The True Diaper Champ!!!,"The Diaper Dekor works so well I keep it in my daughter's closet with her clothes. Try that with a Diaper Genie! I am amazed by the number of diapers it holds without sacrificing quality or functionality. The one-hand operation is a life-saver. Simply put, the Diaper Dekor is a must-have item for your nursery, whether you are using cloth or disposable diapers!"
3,"Good for awhile, but ours broke.","The diaper dekor is a glorified trash can with a pedal to lift the lid. We loved it until about 2 weeks ago. (We have had it for about 8 months). One of the flaps on the top just decided to stop closing after you put the diaper in. So now, when you open it, you basically have an open diaper pail. (it stinks!) It holds a lot of diapers, but for $40, you would not expect it to break. It's the easiest to use on the market."
2,Buy yourself another Diaper pail,"I received this item at my baby shower (11/03) and we still have it. The doors keep falling off, it fills up fast. My daughter who's into everything have learned how to open the top and remove all the diapers. She know that the door doesn't close and falls apart, so she's always where the plastic bag is. We had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door, because when we would open it, it would come out of it's holders. Sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone. But, when it has some stinky diapers in it, it stinks and so does her room. I have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor.Not a great pail, it doesn't cost cheap, but it's made cheap."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited about this product for the looks, price and initital reviews. We have a 6 month old, thus using this system for 6 months now. It was great the first 4 months of use. No real smell and easy to dispose of the bag. However, now the interior door is broke and it really stinks. These doors are hinged, but are not manufactured in a way that it can be fixed. I agree that when your baby begins to have really stinky diapers then this system doesn't stand up fully to the challenge. Maybe we need to buy freshners for the inside. All in all I am disappointed!"
2,"Baby gets older, smell gets worse","I really liked this Diaper Dekor when my baby was younger and her poops did not really smell that bad. But trust me, when they get older (she is now 17 months) and start eating food that makes you know from a room away that they need their diaper changed, you do not want this disposal system. Be prepared to get a different one which is what I have to do. Every time that you open it to throw in a dirty diaper the smell hits you in the face like a ton of bricks.........it does not keep the smell away as it is just like opening a regular bin. So I agree that it is great in the beginning but now I have to go out and buy a different one now that she is older so feel that it was a waste of money."
3,"Wonderful Product, BUT!!!","This is a fantastic product! My son is 3 1/2 months old, and I'm still on the refill the machine came with. Here comes the BUT... Now that I am nearing the end of the refill I need to buy more. Well here lies the problem! You can't buy them in any store. I have been to every Babies R Us, and every Toys R Us in the state of CT, and none of them have the refill in stock. They say that they have been waiting months for them to come in! My whole thing is that I REFUSE to pay shipping on an item that should be avaliable in the stores!!! I have reciently discovered that Target.com sells them, and I'm going to go see if the store also has it. Overall this product it fantastic! I use it for my sons diapers, and as a trash can in his room. I never smell anything unless I throw the diaper in it. And even then it is only for a few seconds and it is only a hint of smell. If you don't mind purchesing the refills online, them this product is fantastic, and highly recommended!!!!"
3,Great for a while...,"I loved the Diaper Dekor for the first year. It does keep the smell contained and the foot pedal is very convenient. The built in razor to cut the bags as you switch them out is also great. Also, the refills last a very long time, I just bought my second box of refills and my daughter is 13 months old. My only complaint is that it is so easily accessible that my 1 year old is in it all of the time. She opens the top and pulls out her dirty diapers and she opens the front where the razor blade is. This has been going on for the past few months. Needless to say, this makes me nervous. Of course, I moved it into her closet but it isn't as convenient in the closet. I just wanted to write this review to give a perspective from someone after the first year."
3,Not quite as big as needed,"I use a cloth diaper service, they pick up and drop off once a week. When I got the diaper dekor plus I assumed that it would be big enough to hold a weeks worth of dirty diapers, I only get maybe about two days before they have to start being 'shoved' in... which is just icky, seriously. If you are using disposables and don't mind taking your diapers out to the trash every few days, you'll love this... however, if you going through a service, or just don't want to go out to the trash every few days look into a larger capacity diaper pail."
2,not what I expected,"This product is too small to handle diapers larger than a size 2. Now that my daughter is in a size 3 diaper, I find I can only fit 6-7 diapers in there before it overflows and I have to empty it. Since I am still changing her 7-8 times a day, I am emptying this once a day. At that rate, I might as well just put a regular trash can in her room. I plan on buying a different diaper pail this weekend. Plus it does not elimnate odor well at all. I have washed it and added baking soda to the bottom but there is still an odor. This one just did not meet my expectations."
2,This Diaper Dekor Stinks and I don't like it!!,"After reading several online reviews, including the ones here, I opted for the Diaper Dekor. What a mistake. It was able to contain the smell of infant diapers well, however, now that my daughter is 5 months the Dekor does nothing to contain odors. In addition, the flap door on the inside completely broke off. We do not mishandle items and have always been gentle putting diapers in. I do not believe the plastic door should break in 5 months. I know many people love this item. I recently checked the claim of three odor seals and discovered the ""seals"" are simply 3 plastic doors that close on one another. There is one rubber seal however the trap doors do not completely seal. Do not waste your time and money as I must now find another diaper pail."
5,Love It!,"We had purchased a much cheaper model which used regular trash bags. I thought this would be wise. Unfortunately, we couldn't stand the smell! I had owned a Diaper Genie when my 8 yr old son was an infant. It broke after pushing diapers through.This diaper pail is wonderful!! :) We have noticed no odor and it is very easy to use! It is well worth the extra money!"
5,A Nursery Must Have,"This is a great product ! I registered for the Diaper Dekor because I liked the fact that you can use it as a regular garbage can after diaper time. It is super easy to use ( no twisting or flipping ), and really keeps the smell in well. It holds a lot of diapers and is really easy to change bags. I bought just one refill and I just ran out of it and my son is 11 months old !! I am now just using a regular kitchen garbage bag and it seems to be working fine also !! I HIGHLY suggest this product to all new moms !"
1,Doesn't hold in odors.,"Silly idea. Everytime you put in a dirty diaper, all the odors from the other diapers are allowed to escape. We are getting rid of ours before our next child is due and replacing it with a different brand. Would not buy."
2,used to like...now I don't,"I really liked this for the first 11 months. Now that my son is older, he loves to play with it. The problem is that he gets his fingers caught in the lid, which seems to really hurt him. He can lift the lid which makes the lid fall down on his hand causing him to cry until I can unlatch his finger. He also can stick his arm inside and touch the contents making his arm smell like dirty diapers."
4,Simple and Functional Diaper Pale,"I bought the Dekor system about a month ago after being a little fed a up with the size limitation of my old Munchkin. I like the simple design and I like the way the bags feed from a continuous piece of plastic, so I can actually remove the diapers anytime. Even though I was looking for something that held more than the Munchkin, as my son gets older (nearly 6 months old now) and starts eating some pureed food, sometimes I find I really need to empty the diaper pale IMMEDIATELY, if you know what I mean.My only criticism is that it gets smelly quickly - I liked that the Munchkin had a baking soda insert. Have to admit that I throw a little Carpet Fresh in this one after a few diapers go in. Makes the rest of the week smell a bit better. Anyway, it's not such a terrible thing, it actually just forces me to empty the darn thing more frequently.Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System"
2,Flimsy - not worth the price!,"I was glad to see that others had experienced the same thing I did with the trap door. This product worked great for the first 9 months. But recently one of the trap doors broke and it doesn't spring back up, which means it can get really stinky in the room, really fast! I'm disappointed and now I see this looks like it might be a design flaw since others have had the same problem. I will be purchasing a different model."
4,Good choice...,I have used different diaper disposal systems at friend's houses. The only one I have no experience with is the Diaper Champ. I feel that the Diaper Dekor is one of the best on the market right now from my experience. I have mine full to the brim and so far have not detected any odors and I am not hard of smelling. I feel that if a diaper system smells then there is no point in purchasing one. You could just buy a cheap Rubbermaid trashcan instead. This one looks nice and is easy to use. I am very glad I received this as a shower gift.
3,Cheap plastic,Received from our baby shower. Wanted the Dekor after reading reviews about how much better this diaper pail system was than Champ or Genie. My husband and I were both disappointed with the quality of plastic...one of the two plastic flaps that cover the dirty diaper area broke after the second use. You can definitely smell dirty diapers (probably b/c broken flap but maybe not). Husband went right out and bought a Diaper Champ the next day because of the smell...the first thing that he bought for the baby. Love the Champ b/c you don't smell anything and don't need special bags.
4,Recommended,"This product is wonderful! I've used it for my two kids and will use it for the third! It definitely cuts down on the odor. The bags are a little pricey, but they last a while."
2,Stinky-Cheese!,"When I first purchased this item I thought it was an A+. There were no unpleasant odors, the specials bags were a bit expensive but who cares if it doesnt smell, right? Then my son started eating more solids and he is now 14 months old and the odors that eminate and fill his room are hazardous. The flap on the top broke off and so now there is no way to try and hide the smells. It seems a very cheap product, my friend has had the same door break on the top as well. I am going to try the Diaper Champ and see how that goes. I would not recommend this product unless you plan on potty training your baby when they start to eat solid foods."
1,Don't Buy,This does not eliminate or even contain the smell.It is also very easy for my son to get into.The Neat Diaper Disposal System is far superior.Do not buy the diaper dekor.
5,Simply the Best!,"I recommend this diaper pail to all my friends, and I strongly urge everyone out there to go this route instead of that dreaded Diaper Genie. Compared to the Genie, where one must push the dirty diaper thru and twist every single time---the Diaper Dekor is a simple foot pedal and no dirty hands. It's perfect. PLEASE go with the Dekor and leave the Genie in the bottle."
2,After breastfeeding and onto solids one word STINKY!,"Well, I started out LOVING this diaper pail. It was because I was breastfeeding and no real odors had started...and then the solids well, it was alright and now that our 11 mo. old has moved onto toddler foods and 3rd foods......OMG....you put 1 poopy diaper in it and leave the room for 5 min. you have a whole new scent in your baby's room....and it is'nt pleasent!!!! So, I don't even use it anymore because it is completley useless. Wish I bought the Diaper Genie! So don't buy this for the long haul it does not work so well. It is nasty! Esp. when you go to remove the diaper nothing like getting a cloud of stink in your face...ughhhh....only way to avoid that is work fast and hold your breath!"
2,Does not eliminate smells,"I bought this because of the reviews I read. I have discovered that it does not eliminate the smell of a poopy diaper. I have heard that the diaper genie does. There is a new one out on the market that I may try. Unfortunately I have lots of the dekor refill bags. I would not recommend this, unless you have triplets and you plan on having more than one system. It is easy to use, so that's why I gave it a couple of stars."
2,This Thing Stinks!!! Literally,"We bought the Diaper Dekor Plus based on what I read in ""Baby Bargains"" and the recommendations on this web site. We love the functionality, it is very easy to use and empty, but it makes the whole room stink! You can even smell it from the hallway. My son is only 6 weeks old, I can't imagine what it would smell like with older kids diapers. We have now purchased the new Safety 1st Neat pail...hope it is better."
1,Not effective after baby is year old!,"I thought this was a great product...that was until my son started on solids. Pew! This product does NOTHING to contain the smell! We have tried everything. Lysol, emptying more often, etc. But the liners get VERY expensive...and it doesn't help! I steered away from the Diaper Genie, but everyone I know who has toddlers still swear it contains the stink. I went out and got one this morning. It can't be any worse than the Diaper Dekor! I'm really bummed I spent the money on this disposal system."
3,Save your money,Just buy any small trash can with a foot pedal and rubber seal on the lid and it will do the job of this one.
1,Hated it!!,"I recently bought this diaper pail for my 9 month old and it's terrible, it started smelling in a few days! I saw it got good reviews here and decided to buy it because of that. Once I looked at the reviews closer, I noticed that most of the reviewers had very young babies which, of course, don't have diapers as stinky as older ones, which is probably why the reviews are so good. When my son was first born, I went to Wal-Mart and bought a Rubbermaid trash can that has a lid you can press and it opens. I used that with scented bags (I got mine at Big Lots) and didn't have a problem until recently,when it started to give off a little smell. Well, it was much better than this product and I'm going back to my cheap system. I'd say don't waste your money. I know many people who never even bought a diaper pail but just used something similar to my Wal-Mart trash can and said it worked out just fine. Luckily, I bought my Diaper Dekor Plus at Babies R Us and they said I can return it"
3,Does Not Complete Odor Control.,"It's very easy to change the bags, the one step feature works as descibed however, the so called triple seal design DOES NOT complete odor control. We can smell a poopie diaper after a few hours of discarding it in the system."
2,Manufacturing defect,"I registered for this item back and receiveed it when my son was born in January, 2006. About 2 1/2 months later, the spring on one side of the insert broke and when I tossed in a diaper, the trap door didn't spring back closed. I contacted the company, and after about 2 weeks of emails and phone calls, I received an email back advising me that they had a problem with a batch of them and would send me out another insert. Well...after another 3 months or so, I once again find myself with the same problem. I don't even use it that frequently (maybe 3x a day) because my son is in daycare full time. I have once again contacted the company but I am very annoyed that I have had the same problem twice within 6 months. At this point, I will hopefully receive another insert but I would not be too quick to rush out and purchase this product again."
2,"Not cost effective, not worth it.","As with printers, it's not the equipment that makes up most of the cost, it's the refills. I'd estimate that you spend at least three or four times as much as you would on equivalent capacity regular garbage bags, and I don't find the supposed ""odor control"" to be better than regular odor control garbage bags, possibly worse because they're so thin. Just get a good step can and use odor control garbage bags instead."
2,"WORKS FINE WHILE BABY IS STILL LITTLE, BUT THEN STINKS!","The Diaper Dekor Plus system works fine while you baby is still small and really not eating a lot of solid foods yet.My son's room began to permanetly smell like a dirty diaper because of this system.I decided to find a new dipaer disposal system and I decided to go with the Diaper Champ, and all I can says is that I wish I had gone with the Diaper Champ from the beginning. My son's room is finally free of the dirty diaper smell thanks to the Diaper Champ! I DO NOT recommend buying the Diaper Dekor Plus system at all! Save your money and buy the DIAPER CHAMP, it's cheaper AND you don't have to buy special replacement bags."
1,SMELLY,"I totally don't get how the other folks are getting odor-free use out of this product. When my baby was very young, his diapers weren't that smelly to begin with, but now that he is on solids at 13mos., I have to keep this pail inside the closet and change the bag every night to keep his room odor-free. Also the front door latch is constantly loosening, so the front door is often found in a slightly open position (also the baby has figured out how to open it, yet another reason to keep it in the closet). If you look at the construction, there is no way this is sealed well enough to function as described. Unfortunately, I will need to toss this diaper pail and buy another product."
1,Don't Bother!,"We have had this product for 16 months and have had the door with flaps replaced twice! The same piece has just broken for the 3rd time and the bucket itself really smells. We only put ""wet"" diapers in it and change it very often. I've tried bleaching the entire unit...have used baking soda...lavender oil and cannot get rid of the odor. The company is very nice and quick to replace the broken units, but it isn't worth the money or time."
2,We liked it a lot for the first few months,"We received the Diaper Dekor over a year ago as a shower gift, yes I registered for it. It looked and sounded great. We loved it at first, it was easy to use and change. Once the heat went on in our son's room we noticed it didn't hold the odor in. Then as our son started to walk a few months ago, we have been missing a few items (ie the remote, cordless phone) I keep finding them in the Diaper Dekor. Also, I have found a few diapers outside the Diaper Dekor that I know were at one point inside it. My next concern is when our son learns how to open the front door and finds the cutter. I plan to go buy a different diaper pail before that happens."
1,No longer holds in the smell,"This was a great system when I first got it. Maybe it was because newborn diapers don't smell as bad, but now it doesn't hold in the smell at all. I have a 1050 sq.ft home and the bedroom is at one end of the house and I can smell it all the way at the other end. . My son is 8 months old. I heard that Diaper Dekor changed the bags that they sold and the new ones don't work as well. Not sure what the problem is, but I'm now looking at spending more money on a new diaper containment system. Also, my husband complained that it's too short. He has to lean way down to make sure the diaper goes in the hole while trying to wrangle an 8 month old."
1,Better Idea: Carboard Box and Large Plastic Bag,"One would be better served to use a tall cardboard box and long plastic bag, than to invest in the over-priced DIAPER DEKER XL. The left side of the double-door push-lid does not function; it is continually open, which does not help odor control. What else is this expensive thing supposed to do? Reviews were outstanding, but it came with no instructions. Intuitive? Turn the only dial, and nothing happens. The bag is not twisted at the top of the last deposit, to further trap in the odor. I cannot return because the THREE-DAYlimit is over! I'm not a machine, nor on a time-table. Most returns are do-able within 30 days, which is satisfactory. I am very, very sorry that I went through the expense of getting this to 'help' my husband with PD. Think twice about laying out hard-earned money for the Diaper Deker. If you bought one, KEEP THE BOX!!!"
2,"arrived sunday, departed wednesday","We bought the Diaper Dekor to replace a Genie that we had for over two years. The Genie had really begun to smell after all that time. After doing some research and reading the reviews, we decided to give the Dekor a try.Well, it arrived in the house on a Sunday. It was decided on Tuesday that it would be leaving. While it is truly more convenient than the Genie (step & drop), it did not contain the odor of a toddler diaper well. In fact, both my wife and I began to notice the smell by the time it had no more than 3 diapers in it. At first we thought we must be doing something incorrect. However, we reviewed everything again and decided that the Dekor really couldn't contain odors the way it claimed.We bought another Genie to replace the old one."
2,Loved it at first but now it STINKS!,"We loved our Dekor for about the first 9-10 months, but now I can't stand it. It was great at first. I loved the ease and convenience of just throwing the dirty diaper in there. It holds a lot of diapers and refills last forever. In the beginning there was no smell. But now that my son is eating all solids and his diapers are stinky, it just doesn't contain the odors anymore. Even after 1/2 a day or so sometimes I'll have to change it. I've found that the whole Dekor actually has an odor to it. I've tried washing it and disinfecting but no luck. Right now, it's in the backyard. I thought maybe some fresh air might help it. We'll see. We may resort to just putting the stinky diapers in a plastic grocery bag and taking it outside (which is a pain since the baby's room is upstairs). I haven't tried any other disposal systems, but my friend has her genie outside too for the same reason."
2,"Easy to use, but stinky!!","Our first diaper disposal system had a part that broke so I decided to try this one. It is definitely easy to use, but my son's whole room smelled like dirty diapers. The Safety First Neat Diaper Disposal system keeps his room odor free and is much better than this product. If you are looking for odor free, then this is not the product for you."
3,Great at first but can't hold smells in,When we first got this item it worked great... but newborns really don't have stinky diapers. Once I started feeding my son food his diapers really started to stink and if you put in the diaper dekor plus the smell still got into the room. We loved this item at first but now that it has been put to the real test I wonder why we even bought it.
4,Much better than the diaper champ!,"So far, so good. Not stinky and easy to use. I had the diaper champ but it stinks after a few months and also is tough to use with large diapers. This one is hands off. I wish it held a little more but other than that, it is fantastic."
1,Don't waste the extra money on this one!,"I purchased the Diaper Dekor Plus before my baby was born. The first night home with my baby, I placed one dirty diaper in it. The next day I would have like to died when I walked into the room. The smell was horrible. I can't believe I paid extra money for this system. I read all the good reviews thinking I would get my money's worth, but was I wrong. Now, I do not put dirty (poopy) diapers in it and there is still a smell. I think I am going to get one of the other diaper systems and give this one to someone without such a sensitive nose."
2,Way too expensive,"We are preparing for our first child, and after so many great reviews we thought we might get this product. But after serious persistence from 1st time grandma,(lol, had to mention that as anyone knows how giddy grandparents can get.)Our local Walmart carries this same brand for 25 dollars, 4 free refills, and no waiting to be delivered. Extra credit for Mommy and Daddy that do their research."
1,this thing stinks -- literally,A friend reccomended this to me for our first baby. She said the pail had hardly any odor. I didn't realize at the time her kid is in childcare every day and leaves it's poopies in another pail. Since my son is home most of the time his poops end up in the pail once or twice a day. I was just changing the bag every time but that is wasteful because you need to pull out extra bag every time to tie the ends. I have now been double bagging the poos and that seems to have solved my problem. Too bad my kids poo doesn't smell like roses like I'd hoped it would!
3,Refills Hard to Find,"The Decor refill bags last a while but when it comes time to buy a new box, there are limited places to shop. The Diaper Genie refill bags are available everywhere- our grocery store, Target, local drugstores. I can only find the Decor bags at Babies-r-us or online."
2,Not so great.,"Originally my husband and I really enjoyed this product. It seemed to hold in the smell and was very easy to use. Then one of the doors broke (only after having it 9 months) and it just couldn't hold in the smell any more. I tried using a stick on freshener, but it just didn't do it for me.After talking with friends who also have babies they recommended the Diaper Champ. I have recently purchased one and love it! You don't have to buy special bags, just normal garbage will do (one of the other complaints of the Dekor is the bags are so expensive), and now her room smells like a baby, not dirty diapers.Hope this helps!"
5,Easy to Operate with Less Odor!,"I own 2 diaper pails (one upstairs and one downstairs). I researched diaper pails before making this one my first choice. My other diaper pail is a Diaper Champ. I do like it, but not as much as the Diaper Dekor. Here's what I like best about the Diaper Dekor:1) The bags are lightly scented so there is less odor.2) Very easy to use - just press the foot pedal to open the lid and drop the dirty diaper into the pail. (My Diaper Champ sometimes gets diapers stuck in it and I have to open it up and push them through with my hands.)3) This is the only pail that I've found that can be used as a regular trash can later. It doesn't scream ""Diaper Pail"" like the other ones do.The only downside is buying the proprietary bags. My daughter is 10 weeks old and I have yet to change the replacement cartridge that came with the pail. I do have 2 pails so I'm using this one about 1/2 the time."
1,Don't Be Fooled !!,"I bought this because it had less steps than the Diaper Genie and it could be used as a regular trashcan later. It was a huge waste of money. My son is only 5 months old and I am already looking for a new diaper can. With only 1 or 2 ""dirty"" diapers the entire nursery smells.I have even dumped baby powder in it to try to keep the odor under control but that didn't work.The door that ""locks"" pops open when the bag is half way full. The bags are too thin to really hold anything so I have to put it in another bag just to empty it, for fear the bag will break. The Diaper Genie may be more trouble but it may just be worth it, the Diaper Dekor certainly isn't."
1,Pee-Euwh!!!!,We had to replace our Diaper Genie recently because the top had broken off. We decided to buy a Diaper Dekor. We thought it would be a great product due to the favorable reviews and the idea that you could use it as a trash can later. The cheaper refills was also a key selling point as we have a toddler who goes through a toddler film refill every week and a half.This is one of the worse baby products we have ever used. Even with diligent dumping and cleaning our daughter's room smelled like a toilet! We even stuck a couple of stick ups in the pail. Nothing helped. The people at our local Babies R Us store were generous enough to exchange the Dekor for a new Diaper Genie with the twist away feature (way easier than the old model)and poof no more skink!Maybe this product was meant for infants under 1. I'd given it no stars if it were an option.
5,Fabulous product !!!,"I bought the diaper dekor after reading several rave reviews about it at websites including this one. I have been sooo pleased with it! I did not have to put in a refill until my daughter was almost 8 weeks old, and we went through a ton of diapers the first few weeks. My daughter is in a co-sleeper so we have moved her changing station and the diaper dekor into our bedroom for now. I never smell diapers when I walk into my bedroom. I only smell it a little when depositing a diaper or changing out the bags. We also use about one bag a week. I would recommend this product to any new parent. It was well worth every penny!!"
1,Baby's Room Always Smells Bad,"Horrible! Smells escape as soon as the lid is opened, even when nearly empty. We've scrubbed and aired out the pail, but to no avail. Had to buy powder-scented tabs to throw in the plastic bag ... still did nothing. Definitely DO NOT recommend, this is a waste of space in the nursery!"
1,Don't buy,"The Diaper Dekor is good for 1 child 1 year of age or less. Once the diapers get really smelly, the plastic bag is NOT thick enough to contain the smell. We switched to a Diaper Genie and solved the problem."
2,Doesn't hold the oder at all,"I picked this one out because I felt that it looked the best out of all them, what a mistake that was. It does look pretty but I have to put each poopy diaper in a separate Albertson's bag to keep the oder, hence a big waste.I don't recommend this one at all. Very disappointed."
2,Not so great,"Mine broke the first week I had it. (One of the inner flap's spring broke.) It does not contain odors very well.However, I do like the foot pedal for opening and it does hold a lot of diapers. I feel like I would have been better off with a regular trash can with a lid though."
3,"Some nice features, but a little disappointing","Having had a mishap with our Diaper Genie (got locked in a hot moving van for a week and hadn't been emptied so stank to high heaven when we finally got it into our new apt), we needed to find a replacement, and headed off to the store to get one. We saw this diaper pail and really liked the idea of a one-handed system, so figured we'd give it a try. The ease of use is fabulous, especially with a squirmy little guy on the changing table. However, like other reviewers, I find that the pail needs to be emptied fairly frequently (e.g., every other day), or else ends up being very stinky. Also, it's so easy to use that my 13-month-old loves to open it and put random things into it. Perhaps a toilet lock will help with that, but it's still a little frustrating to know that at any given moment, my son could be putting something we don't want to dispose of in there."
2,Not satisified,"I started using this product when my son was about 6 months old, it was great at first but once he got older and his poops starting getting more stinky, the diaper dekor did not contain the smell! It was horrible, my son's room smelled like a garbage dump! I changed the bag often and even deodorized the pail 2-3 times a week. I am not at all satisfied and will try a different one for my next baby."
2,Looks pretty cool,"I really liked this product at first, looks cool, easy to use, etc. However, once my baby became a toddler, my opinion quickly changed. He's ALWAYS opening the lid and digging into it to grab used wipies. Yuck! And he easily figured out how to open the front door. He then ripped the door completely off, and broke the hinge so it's beyond repair. This was at 12 months of age. Also, it doesn't really contain the smells all that well. I wish I'd bought a diaper genie."
1,doesn't contain smells,"Like the other reviewer, I too thought this was great for about a month. Once my infants diapers actually started to smell, The diaper dekor was horrible. There was a constant odor in the room and when you opened the lid, it was even worse. I'm not impressed with the triple sealing lid at all."
4,As good as can be expected,"I bought the Dekor because a friend of mine said that the other leading diaper pail did not work well. The Dekor definitely keeps the smell at bay but ONLY if the pail's lid is COMPLETELY closed. So, when the diapers start piling up and keeping the lid cracked open, you better change out the bag. I only had some minor problems with it. First, the swinging ""door"" that you drop the diaper into gets messy sometimes (because of diapers getting stuck to it), and second, the foot pedal on mine broke off. I can still push on the metal bar to open the Dekor, but if I don't have shoes on, it can be a pain. Overall though, this diaper pail does the job"
1,No Different Than An Open Trash Can,"My husband and I bought the Diaper Dekor Plus for our son after his Diaper Champ was simply not usable after 13 months (it stunk even if it was empty). We have now had the Diaper Dekor for 2 months and I wish we still had the box to return it. It is no different than having an open trash can in your child's room. I bought it after reading the reviews of all the systems and this one sounded like the best. Now I know what the thing holds and not very pleasant smells are involved, but even though we empty it daily and spray it with disinfectant his room smells like a farm. We should of just bought another Diaper Champ. I wish I could give this no stars, it is the worst baby product we have bought."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,"I'd give this zero stars if I could. I bought this product, as I had read quite a few reviews about it, claiming how good it was. But after a few months, I saw one of my girlfriends had gotten a Diaper Champ. I noticed that it keeps smell out just as well as the Diaper Dekor, but, it's CHEAPER, and you don't have to buy the stupid, expensive refills for it! It uses any bag, and STILL keeps out the smell. I went through so many packages of refills for the Diaper Dekor, it was such a waste of money. The next day I went out and bought a Diaper Champ."
1,disappointed in new england,"I am extremely disappointed with this product....what a complete waste of money! I originally had a diaper genie, however my son broke the top off of it and I decided to try the diaper dekor because it seemed a little easier to use. The design is a nice idea, but boy does this thing STINK!!! We change this every couple of days before it's even full and it still stinks. I've tried deodorizers, baking soda, lysol, etc and it still takes your breath away!! We never experienced any odor problems with the diaper genie....I'm kicking myself for wasting the money on this thing. I actually went out and bought another diaper genie because we couldn't take the stench of the diaper dekor anymore. Do yourself a favor and don't waste the money!!!!"
3,A disappointment,"I read a lot of reviews for the Dekor diaper pale and was interested in it because of it's sleek look and no-hands use to open it. What I didn't realize was that it required special bags. It also doesn't keep out odor as well as I hoped it would. I needed a second pale for another level of our house and opted to buy the cheap Safety First diaper pale instead. I've found that it keeps odors out better, is just as easy to use, and can be used with any cheap bags."
1,"Used to be great, the new bags are awful...","I've been using the Diaper Dekor Plus for over a year and a half. The old bags used to work perfectly, and the product deserved 5 stars then. But with the new bio-degradable bags the nursery stinks.... I'm on the market for a new product, the Diaper Dekor is going to the trash."
4,"Good, but not for Toddlers","With the birth of my second child, I wanted another solution besides the Diaper Genie - I hated twisting the bags. This one works great. The only drawback is that my 2 year old can easily open this pail and drop toys (or whatever else) into it."
4,Better than the Genie,"Very pleased with the Dekor. Simple, quick, holds odors, and can be used as a regular trash can. The refills are economical. My baby is 6 months old and we haven't gone through the orginal 3 pack we bought. Definitely recommend this."
2,It was nice until....,"My son is 13 monthes old and up until this time i would have recommended this product to anyone. I even bought one as a shower gift. Since my son has started solid foods, it has been horrible. I have had to move it out of the babies room and into the hall. I have even started empting it everyday. Now that it is in the hall my living room smells. I keep this thing clean and frequently spray it with lysol. Up until this point I guess because my son was breastfeed and solids weren't his main source of food it wasn't that bad. I have used a diaper genie before and found it a lot of effort but if it means no smell, i will get it. You can't but a price on having a freash smelling house."
3,"Odor Free, for the most part....","I added this item to my baby registry after doing much research on all the diaper pails.I like the fact that the refills last a long time-- I didn't have to put a new one in until my son was 3 months old. However-- it does not hold as many diapers as it claims! I find myself changing the diapers out at least one per week, otherwise the room starts to smell a little. My son is now 4 months old, and just today one of the ""flaps"" you stick the diaper through broke, which may cause a problem in the future with the odor. I plan on contacting Diaper Dekor regarding getting a replacement. Overall it's easy to use and does the job."
3,Okay for the first 8 months,"The Dekor was great for the first 8 months, but then the odor just would not go away. I know that this is a poopy diaper receptacle, but I cleaned it with Lysol, Clorox, etc... This past week I even soaked it in the tub with bleach and hot water, but it still stinks. We had to take it out of the nursery because it smelled so bad. The only other drawback of course is the liners. They are a bit expensive, and in Memphis the only place we can find them is at Babies R Us, which is a little out of the way. However, I did love the fact that it is hands-free and when it was odor-free, it was great! I just bought the Neat system yesterday, but already it's a little bit of a hassle. Oh well... the search continues for the perfect diaper pail? How's the Genie?"
3,Its Ok,"It works great at first. Especially for those nasty runny ones, but as my little one got older and the diapers got smellier so did his room! So if your in it for something easy and quick this is it, but later on look out for the smells!"
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I have owned two diaper genies... which totally blocked the smell from escaping. I purchased the diaper dekor for my third child due to the great reviews, and the simple use. Yes, it is simple to use, however, it does not block the smell at all. This is the worst diaper pail I have ever used. The smell is horrific, and the refills are ridiculously overpriced.It is now used as a trash barrel in my house with a regular kitchen trash bag. Do not buy this for your diaper pail."
1,STINKY and impractical,"Get the Diaper Genie Elite II, the one with a foot pedal. This one is gross. After you push down the pedal, there's a piece of white plastic that you have to push down to put the diaper in = unsanitary over time. This system also stinks."
2,Odorous,"After a year of use, I finally gave up on the bathroom trash can with a flip open lid that I used plastic shopping bags in because diaper smells had permeated the plastic. I then researched reviews on several diaper pails. It seems that as many people like a brand a whole lot dislike it. I finally went with Dekor due to the easy of use. It indeed it very easy to use and doesn't require two hands, which is why it got two stars instead of one. However, it does not contain smells. Just one or two diapers and a horrible stench escapes the hatch when putting another in. Plus, when I open the bedroom door after my child's nap, the whole room will stink. This is just not acceptable. I shouldn't have to change the bag daily. At least it can be used as a normal trash can, which is what I'll be doing and trying another brand."
1,"Stinks, literally.",This diaper pail does NOT keep odors in. We used it for less than a month than got rid of it. Yuck!
3,Good for first 6-8 months- pre real food,"I've been using the Diaper Dekor Plus for 21 months now. I thought the odor control was fine until my daughter started eating real food. Once we got into the really smelly diapers, the Diaper Dekor did not contain the odor. I looked to see if they offered a different type of refill, one with a thicker plastic to help contain the odor, but they didn't. At that time I realized that you can use regular kitchen garbage bags instead of the $22 refill. I've been using them for several months now with no problems. Just lift the inner insert up, put the opened garbage bag in the center and then tuck the open edges of the garbage bag around where you would have put the refill and close the top. I also put one of the stick up air fresheners on the bottom inside of the unit- that helps a little with the odor."
3,Product broke after two years of use,"I have been using Diaper Dekor Plus since my twins came home from the hospital. There are two problems with this diaper system that folks should be aware of. 1) If you plan to use it in a bedroom or bath that is carpeted, scrap that idea. We had to bungie-cord this diaper bin to one of our twin's cribs so it wouldn't tip over when you stepped on the foot pedal to open the lid. And the foot pedal didn't work so well on carpet which is a problem when you are holding your baby on the changing table with one hand and trying to dispose of the soiled diaper with the other. After about 19 months of withstanding the dumping of the diapers from twins one of the inner flaps that helps keep the smell IN the bin broke and we had to tape it permanently closed. After another couple months the other flap broke... just in time for potty training."
2,First part excellent; Second Part Poor,This is a series of short stories. The first few are very good but the ending series of GHOST stories are awful. I was greatly disappointed within the book much less compared to other NIVEN classics. At this price tho if you are in the series you might as well bite
5,Grown up Science Fiction,No namby pamby super hero unbelievable B.S. but great writing with math reasoning. Had a hard time putting down. Nivens gets lost sometimes but always seems to find his way back to the storyline.
2,Beowulf's Progress,"Beowulf Shaeffer started out as this cool space pilot who swoops down on a neutron star, journies to the galactic core, and visits the weirdest planet in Known Space.Later on, though, his adventures involve stopping criminal activities, as if he's become an interstellar cop.In the end, he's this amoral dude on the lam from the Earth government in the most convoluted plot this side of interpreted BASIC spaghetti code.The early classics are in other collections, and will endure. This effort, thankfully, will be forgotten. If you can figure what it was about in the first place."
2,"Same old, same old","Niven is an excellent writer, and if you haven't seen his previous ""Known Space"" collections, this will be a treat. This is a rehash of his classics, ""second verse, same as the first."" If you've been following him for a while, don't bother, you've read 'em..."
3,A book that starts good and declines steadily.,"Known Space. It's cool. Beowulf Shaeffer. Cool guy. Mostly.The first few stories, especially the Nebula award winning ""Neutron Star,"" are of extremely high quality. It's something of a shock, then, that the later stories decline so rapidly. Niven's writing style changes quite noticably in the real-life years between the stories, from a more traditional space opera to something...not. I couldn't even finish ""Procrustes,"" it was so bizarre and un-Niven that I had trouble following it.If you are lucky enough to find the book Neutron Star, which contains the first few stories of this book (in addition to a few others), go for it. It's a better buy overall. If not (this will be most of you, unfortunately), it's up to you whether the first half of the book is worth the price of admission, since the second half arguably isn't."
4,An assortment of excellent hard science fiction stories.,"Beowulf Schaeffer is the recurring pilot-hero of many of Niven's ""Known Space"" stories, including some of his most famous, like ""Neutron Star"". In this volume they are collected and put in order, with a framing sequence. An indisputable aid to understanding Niven's other ""known space"" works, like RINGWORLD, and immense fun in its own right. Here you first meet the Puppeteers, you first find out the galaxy is exploding, you first meet the Outsiders and other aliens. (Niven does the best aliens in the biz. A few might cattily say his aliens are better than his humans.) A fascinating future presented by one of the best sf writers still writing"
4,the second is better,"Out of the two 1968-9 Electric Flag studio albums, the second, self titled one is the better. True, it does not have Mike Bloomfield, but the sound is far superior, the arrangements are tighter, and the band seems more sure of itself.The album is less ambitous, but the execution is better, and there are creative flurishes: listen to the segue from Sonny into With Time There Is Change, using the flute for transition. It is all part of the dark, smokey vibe, which focuses the album more than Long Time Commin, which is great, but never quite acheives an overall mood.( I wonder what would have happened if they had started with a basic blues album like this, then tackled the more lofty work of Long Time Commin'0It is a shame this band broke up so soon. Both records show they had plenty of potental. Buy this twofer, and you'll see the many ways they could have gone"
5,Nice coffee table book,Good book for sparking people's trip ideas. This is one I leave laying out for guests. The routes are not always the one's I would pick for the regions I'm familar with but are all sights to see. The pictures are great and there's enough information if people are curious they can look up more.
3,Missing some good pics of lower Susquehanna Valley,"When I ""searched inside this book,"" I found a text section on ""Holtwood"" & ""Conowingo"" Dams, not far from the Maryland border. I'm from around that area & have always been in awe of its beauty, so when I ordered this book, I was hoping there would be at least one nice photo or two of those places. Much to my disappointment, there was not a single one! The other photos were still good, but a great injustice was done by not showing that beautiful area!"
1,Watch out -- this item is not what is pictured!!!,"I ordered a set of what I thought were going to be six blue youth hockey sticks, two pucks, and two balls. What I got was one adult hockey stick. I called esportsonline, the supplier, and they kindly processed a refund. You can buy a set of six youth hockey sticks directly from their website, which is what I have just done. They are about $43 and do not come with any pucks or balls, though."
5,Pelican Pete begins to grow up in a New Book!!,"Have you read Pelican Pete, Preening for Flight? I liked it even better than the first, ""A Bird is Born."" It is one of those stories that teaches children about perserverance. And I love the reassuring note at the beginning that all the natural history facts had been checked by a scientist from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. We often just accept that what we read to our children is factual when it may not be.There is also a ""Did you know"" section and suggestions for learning more about pelicans at the back of the book--treasure troves for curious children and parents.Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of ""This is the Place"""
2,Pretty easy game,"My son is 8 1/2 years old. Luckily we rented this game before we bought it. He finished the entire game in about 3 1/2 hours of playing time.If your kid is good at these games, rent before you buy."
3,Pretty Good,"I got this game when I was 7. It did not take me long to beat the game. It is very fun, but level three is hard."
1,One heck of a sucky port,"OK, when this first came out for the n64 probably only like 34 people bought it. UbiSoft could've left it at that, but they redid the graphics added a minigame and rereleased it for the GCN, thereby wasting more precious pages in Nintendo Power than they already did with the n64 version. I think this rivals Crazy Taxi for GCN as holder of the World's Suckiest Port Award, hopefully not NP's newest voting category when they come out with the 2002 Nintendo Power Awards."
1,quakers goin duck donald,this game is weird. i hate it . what is up with this quakers thing. it makes me feel confused. they dont make quakers sound like crackers
3,All was good until...,"My son lost the ""key"" and had to buy a replacement form McGaurd. It was rather expensive, and shipping was extra. Actually extra extra, because he needed it quick. OK, it showed up, but the replacement uses a different size socket, so the OEM Volvo tire tool does not work. Now he has to carry another tool just for the McGard locks. How stupid is that?"
4,A good pleasant listening disk that may surprise people.,"The best way to describe this disk is to say the music is pleasant. Far from damning with faint praise, the word best describes listening to the disk. From the opening layering of chords, the music caught my fancy. Better yet, it caught the fancy of my ""Beach Boys"" loving rock and roll wife, so much so that she got me to buy another copy for her to carry in her van when she travels. My four and 1/2 year old daughter calls it pretty music, and likes it when mom switches on the bedroom player to start her day to it. It wears well, even hearing it that many times.John Hebden was a competent, working musician whose six concertos were recently discovered by Ruzena Wood. Cantilena does its usual excellent job of interpreting the music.In my opinion five stars are reserved for Bach, and perhaps Handel, although not Telemann. This music compares well with Telemann, better in places. It is a good disk."
2,I am disappointed with this CD,"I used to be a Pletnev fan after listening to a few of his great CDs from Virgin. However, for some reason, since he joined Deutsche Grammophon, I realized I don't like his playing as much as before. Pletnev still has excellent technique. I own about 20 or so of his CDs and 3 DVDs. I have heard quite a lot of Pletnev. In general, the earlier the recording date, the better the performance. The later recordings lack force and forward momentum and unfortunately replacing that with weird phrasing, inappropriate dynamic changes, and focusing on creating certain effects. I read a lot of good reviews of this recording, but I am disappointed after listening to it once. I probably won't listen to it again. The Prokofiev concerto is better than the Rachmaninoff. I'd give Prokofiev 3 stars and Rachmaninoff 2 stars. I strongly recommended the Rachmaninoff #3 recording from Denis Matsuev with Budapest orchestra. If you haven't listened to that recording, give it a try."
3,A Disappointment,"After being wowed by the Argerich performance of Prokofiev and Rachmaninov, I was looking for an ""authentic"" performance of these Russian masterpieces. Pletnev's interpretation left alot to be desired. His performance lacked the virtuosic flair that I was expecting, especially from a Russian. Instead of being left breathless, I felt rather cheated, considering I spent over $30 AUD on this CD. It was interesting however to see the different ways these artists approach their work and I learnt that a Russian playing Russian music isn't always the best (one good example is Gieserking who plays Debussy magnificently)."
2,not so much,"not enough wood for the money; no particular benifit [wine] hickory, apple,cherry or any other common smoking wood produces great bbq for a whole lot less money will not buy again"
1,Don't waste your money!,"If you are like me, you are probably looking for a solution to organize your limited closet space. Well, keep looking because this is the biggest ripoff yet. I bought two of these and within ONE day of using them, the hook broke on one of them and the air came out of both of them, despite following the directions carefully and accurately."
1,Doesn't stay sealed,"Like many other reviewers, my hanging space bag does not stay sealed.The standard space bags work great though. Shame the same quality isn't present in this hanging version of their product."
4,"Great Item, wish they were a little longer","The suit size bag seems very sturdy and durable. However, I wish the bags were a little longer. I am a fairly tall man so my suits get a little cramped in the bottom. They do make dress size bags. Unfortunately, I cannot find them anywhere on Amazon."
1,Does Not Work as advertised.,All the bags leak and do not hold it's tightness/vacuum! The hanger is cheap plastic and the seal does not hold - even after several runs with enclosed zip-attachment Do not buy!
1,bad quality,"Had no idea what happened- it was good for about 1 month and then got air in! had to move my wedding dress in Whitmor bag which is still holding my evening gowns, husband's shirts and the dress."
2,not as durable,"The plastic is not as durable as advertised. It ripped during my move. Valve seems to work. Packaging was a little deceiving... I thought I was getting 10 bags, not one bag that held 10. Didn't hold 10 jackets."
