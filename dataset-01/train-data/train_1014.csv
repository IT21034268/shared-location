5,Interactive Around the US,This was a gift my granddaughter who is the second grade. She spends an hour a day going back forth to school great way to entertain her during that time.
5,Finntroll Rules!!!,When I purchased this I had not heard of Fintroll before. This is one of the best albums I own. I listen to it constantly and its great to listen to while playing role playing games or RPGs. Its EPIC adventure music and I cant get enough of it.
2,Bwahh ha ha ha hah ahaaaaa! Does comedy belong in metal?,"C'mon now! Black polka metal? Oh lord this is so Spinal Tap it's not even funny, except it is funny. Hilarious in fact, but I'm not quite sure that was the intention of the band. To their credit Fintroll is some of the silliest metal I've ever heard and I've heard a lot of silly metal. To make the experience complete don't forget your accordion (which they use on several songs along with bells and gayflute) and be sure to wear your elf costume. You know, the one with the pointy shoes with the bells on the tips. Sometimes, and that is definitely sometimes, the ""folk"" elements are used to good effect but really there's only so much I can take of this Polish troll polka nonsense. Play it for laughs or for your medieval renaissance fair geek friends and then pitch it in the garbage where it belongs. Its really only amusing once. Don't forget your sword and chainmail!"
1,why do these things happen?,"this band is a total joke. how did they get signed? and everybody needs to stop calling this poop black metal.i don't like polka so why would i want it in my metal.it's just as bad as ""nu metal""."
2,Adjustable height a bit deceiving,"I incorrectly assumed that the height was adjustable between 27 and 42"". Rather, you install an attachment to raise the unit to 42"", and it cannot rest at heights in-between 27"" and 42"". Also, the design has a strange forward-pushing design which I find awkward to position."
2,Great album ruined by incoherent bellowing,"There's no doubt the music on this record is awesome, but everytime the singer opens his yap is a tragedy. The monotone, inarticulate bellowing ruins what are otherwise moving passages. The vocals are best when used as ambient background effects to accompany the music. This could have been a totally instrumental release in my opinion, and I would've given it four stars. I'm so sick of bands with ""singers"" that do nothing but bellow. Yep, you're pretty angry dude. YAWN!"
2,Hollow Thwok!,"The production on the album is very amateurish. The drums sound really bad. The snare has this hollow ringing thwok! sound that, I think, renders the whole album unlistenable.If you can get past the drums thing, there is some fairly interesting music on this album. But nothing really great. Not great enough for my ears to take that banging monotonous thwok! snare over and over again anyway."
5,AWESOME!,"I don't know why it took me so long to buy this figuring I've heard nothing but good things about it. It's like Mogwai meets Mastodon. Heavy, epic and beautiful."
4,oceanic,"yesterday i picked up 'oceanic', the new album from isis. i was very pleased with the 2001 release 'celestial' as well.terrorizer magazine puts it well when they describe isis as 'music for those who distrust words.' very little singing on this album. but it is a very sprawling work of instrumental art, for the most part. they give you the same sense of imminent destruction that neurosis give you, just from a different perspective.i highly recommend isis to any music fan. ive played isis cds for my friends who arent even into very much rock music at all, and they have loved them. there is a certain level of purity and honesty to their music. it forces you to reevaluate yourself, time and time again. very raw and bleak, but an ultimately satisfying record."
5,a high watermark for human civilization,"this is ridiculously, formidably brilliant. if you like heavy music and don't like this, you've got problems. see them live, absolutely crushing. it's like group meditation, except you don't feel like a dirty hippie."
2,Get Panopticon instead!!!,"Panopticon MUCH better album,this one has some tracks that are just noise.Quite annoying as Isis makes some incredible music.There are a few good tracks on this,but there is no flow due to the occasional noise track.Panopticon."
2,What?,"Great music, too bad it's painful to listen to because of the lack of a vocalist. If they replaced the dying whale with an actual singer, they'd have something to sell."
4,The Cherokee Removal: A Brief History with Documents (Bedford Series in History and Culture,"This is an excellent book for the historian and for the casual reader. It is well written, and with the inclusion of transcripts of primary documents, is an authentic source of accurate information. I highly recommend it."
1,Found on the internet for free.,"For grins, I had searched for one of these electronic articles on the internet, and I found it, for free! So I did the same for this one. Same results (different site had this one).As I expressed in the other review, this feels, to me, too much like relatively expensively priced items at a convenience store, except the only ""convenience"" is saving a few key strokes, and there isn't much information on what you are actually getting. The instant access via a digital vault makes it tempting to do the convenient one-click, and hand over your $5.95."
4,too expensive!,"We are a contracting company and have tried to stick to one brand of rechargeable tool at the same voltage so that the batteries are interchangable. This gets four stars because they do not last under heavy use conditions...the best we have managed is 11 months. We are carefull to fully discharge and fully recharge but they start to not a charge as long then will not charge at all. The other reason for the four stars is that they are way too expensive. It would not be so bad if it lasted for 24-30 months. We have 5 tools, each with 2 batteries and are replacing them about once a year.Bring down the price and it would be a 5 star!"
2,"1,200 Recharges My Eye!","I bought two of these 14.4 volt NiCad batteries with my DeWalt DW991 3/8"" drill August 20, 1999. As of today, April 20, 2002, neither of the two batteries will take or hold a charge. DeWalt says these batteries can take 1,200 charges. Not a chance. I have not abused them in any way. I have used only the original DeWalt charger. I have used them in a DeWalt flashlight, but never let them discharge excessively, or repeatedly ""topped"" them off.I am now faced with a [item cost] cost (with tax) to get my drill going again. Bummer.Seriously considering the Makita 6233DWBLE 3/8"" 14.4-Volt Drill/Driver Kit with Flashlight that uses NiMH batteries--much better technology. Only [item cost] for the kit."
1,Might have enjoyed it more if it actually worked...,"We purchased this toy after my daughter enjoyed playing with this at my sister's house. In spite of reading the reviews stating this toy didn't always work, we purchased it...and, of course, it didn't work properly. Only one side was blowing bubbles and they were very, very weak. I spoke with my sister and she admitted that her bubble machine has good days and bad days. Needless to say, we returned it."
4,A good bubbler,"This bubble machine was ordered because the smaller machine was not in stock. This size is fun, but really more appropriate for an activity not related to play. It works really well - puts out tons of bubble. We have not used it long enough to be able to see its durability, etc."
1,pooped out for my party,"I purchased this for my son's 1st birthday party to entertain the little ones. I opened it the morning of the party and set it up, it worked for 5 minutes and the fan went out! I was so upset!!! I suggest you don't buy it if you want durability."
1,sad not professional,cheap cheap spits bubble fluid bad design a bubble blower i bought in the kid's isle in Walgreens last Summer is better built.
1,Not happy at all......,Not satisfied at all with this bubble machine. Looks very cheap. It says it operates on batteries and it will NOT work unless its plugged in and this defects the purpose of me purchasing a PORTABLE bubble machine for my daughters birthday party. Also it says it comes with bubbles and there were no bubbles included.
1,Very Uncomfortable to refil,"I purchased this product for my son's 5th birthday, but am not at all happy with it. I wish I had the time to return it.Although its a lot of fun, once you switch it on. It can be very messy to refill the tray and also the bubble liquid is in an open tray so there is a concern of tipping over and making a mess."
4,Great little bubble machine!,I bought 3 of these machines to strap onto the back of trucks in a parade my work participated in. They worked great people really loved all the bubbles they produced and it made all of our truck displays look like so much fun!!
3,Yard bag,I've tried several types and manufacturers and this one was as good as they come. The concern is they like the others use cotton or other natural material for the handles and if you get two seasons out of the handles you're lucky.
2,Way Bad,Worst Zenon Movie Okay so Kirsten was Great But Everything Else Didnt Make Sense It's a Stupid Movie
3,Okay...,"Zenon was never a really great movie to begin with, so how could I expect the sequal to be that great? It was entertaining, but it was also annoying. I HATE that dumb futuristic lingo they use, it was like, irritation major. And we don't have the same actress playing Nebula (Raven where art thou?), that kinda bugged me. And Proto-Zoa...okay, we've got all these advancements in technology yet our youth is still looking up to these brainless pop zeros? Riiight. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want the ""Girl of the 21st Century"" to be someone who drools over a guy that's got a porcupine growing out of his head. Anyway, watch it if nothing else is on."
3,Same old story......different narrator.,"This dvd gives a broad overview of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, with little to gain from it, that a history buff or person intrigued by the events that took place on June 25, 1876 might find to be second-nature to their own knowledge of the battle. The dvd explores a story that has been established time and time again through books and films also pertaining to the subject. I would only recommend this product to someone who knows very little about the Battle of the Little Bighorn. I would recommend the much stronger version of the story in the documentary/film ""Last Stand at Little Bighorn""."
1,Disappointing,Spend your money on another Custer dvd. This is a waste of that and time. It gives only the most rudimentary details of the battle and is blatantly biased against Custer. Take my word. Don't buy this dvd.
2,"Weird, weird, weird","If you are into weird books, this is the right one for you. Otherwise do not bother. The story is too odd to put into words. The drawings are fine"
2,Not for NY Admissions,"Very good as a first book to get acquainted with the private school admissions system. If you are applying in New York City or if you already know the process, you will need more than this book can offer. In summary, out of 18 chapters, perhaps 2 are useful for NY admissions. Advise on what kind of photos should go with the essay is just very naive. You are doomed if you follow it in the NY school system."
2,NOT THE SAME PILLS AS BEFORE!,I've used Jim Foley's colon pills before and was very satisfied.But this order of pills do not work the same!Every time I take these new ones I get diarhea!What's up?Can I get my money back?
2,Just OK,"This product worked really well for me at first, so I was very happy. I was very careful to follow the directions properly. The problem is that after you take it for a couple of weeks it stops working and you have to take more and more pills for it to do anything at all. I will not purchase again."
2,Colon Pills not as potent as before,"The Colon Pills are not a potent - lack strength - as the last couple orders I have placed.I have to use more pills to get any effect. Very disappointed...Did you change the formula, because you should change it back. Not sure I will reorder this product from you .."
5,Mighty fine,"First heard this album 2 weeks ago for the first time(ordered from this site) and just heaps great to listen to,so Petrols, havent got favourite song yet from the album but another mighty fine album.brilliant fab wonderfull!!"
2,Dust chip bag.,"This is not the same bag I got with my tool originally. I used it till the old bag was ragged. This replacement was very expensive even if it had been like the original, but to make matters worse, it has a very large inlet port that requires an additional adapter tube thus making the whole deal stick out and more prone to snag on things, as well as making a quick switch to the opposite discharge more clumsy. I don't know if I'll even use it now."
3,Good introductory CD,"I received this as a gift from someone who just knew I might like a Celtic CD. Some of the tracks I like, others I don't, but the musicianship on all of them is commendable. I think this CD could be a good introduction to several different traditional instruments and styles."
2,Interesting story; needs editing and more,"This book is composed mainly of vignettes of people's lives as they were affected by the hurricane as it moved up the coast. It appears to be very well researched; especially considering it was written long after the fact. You experience individual and family disasters by the hundreds as the hurricane moves up the coast. Some were covered in a line or two; others in a page or two. While I initially enjoyed reading about each event, by the time it got to Massachusetts, I was wishing a good editor had excised about 25% of them. I found myself skimming by then and wishing it would end.I'm not sure if the earlier hardback had photos or maps but the paperback had neither. I eventually got out some old National Geographic maps so I could follow the story. Surely there were some good photos that could have added a lot. At least there is a photo on the cover. Still, an interesting story of a unique (so far) event."
1,pure trash,"The only reason I gave it one star is because there isn't a negative star to give.I spent 3 days trying to make this thing work right and called tech support 3 times...still junk.The sound was out of sync and the picture jumps and apparently can't be corrected. I updated my drivers,uninstalled and then reinstalled. Finally on the third call to tech support the tech himself told me that this was a common problem with this product.Don't waste your money nor time."
1,I wished I had read Amazon's reviews before buying this....,"Horrible software - what looks like an easy plug and play product ended up being buggy and unable to deliver anything. After multiple discussions with their tech support (friendly yet ineffectual), numerous re-installs and upgrades, the product still wouldn't work, leading once to a total crash of my system.And before you ask, I am computer literate and run a new Dell Windows XP system with twice the recommended system requirements that the product advices.VERY DISAPPOINTING"
2,letdown,"I loved Illreligous, and very much dislike this one. It's not bad but what it does have is certain boredom. All the songs sound the same. No high points, no low points. Sounds like a rushed album and shows in the songwritting. I wish to get other Moonspell albums..hopefully not as bad as this one."
2,Boring,Totally boring album. Its gothic i know but its too boring this album. Wolfheart and Butterfly effect are better albums. And i prefer to listen Typo o negative than Moonspell. The songs are all the same and there in no <> or any moment that make me like this album.
3,a disappointment,"Darkness and Hope is not a bad album, but considering Moonspell's track record (I'd give all their previous albums 4 or 5 stars), this is a bit of a letdown. These guys are so good, I expect more from them, and hopefully their next album will be a return to form. Few of the tracks really distinguish themselves, and their cover of Ozzy's ""Mr. Crowley"" is nothing special. A C+."
3,"Moonspell, Just A Little Darker?","""Darkness and Hope"" is under the category of goth metal, well.. I must say that I beg to differ.. This is indeed a good album. A good heavy rock album, but not metal. With such haunting titles as ""Darkenss and Hope"" and ""Heartshaped Abyss"", the music lacks the sort of eerie feel that should accompany such bizarre titles.Moonspell seems to be gaining a mainstream sort of vibe.. Even if that is so, this is still a Good, 4 thumbs up album, not scary.. Just strange.. Which is good too, just not quite another""Irreligious"".. That's my opinion and that must mean that it is true..."
5,heartshaped music,"this is the greatest balance between commercial and deep, dark, gothic metal music. it has a bit of pop, but they comeback with the dark metal riffs they are loved for. (...) highlights: firewalking (perfectly could be named opium II) heartshaped abyss and devilred... the cover of Mr crowley is superb. they played it here a few years ago... good move in order to connect with their glorious past."
3,Blessed Be the Peackmakers,"This would be an excellent book if it's your very first book about resolving conflicts, preventing conflicts, managing conflicts and/or about using Biblical applications to resolve, prevent, or manage conflicts.However, if you've been in management for awhile or worked as a church chairperson for a number of years, you will not find much new material here."
2,A foreign language,"Our school uses this book for its graduate management program. Many students in the program have not taken managerial accounting (like myself) and, therefore, would be much better off with a different textbook. After comparing this to other books, I discovered that this book is all ""quantitative"" managerial accounting--a subject that only takes up a single chapter in several other books.This book seems geared toward students who are studying the subject for their master's or Ph.Ds. Our professor had us read the book before ever ""teaching"" anything, and we were quizzed from book-learning alone. That said, I somehow managed to decipher the text well enough to get an A in the course--and that is no mean feat.Best of luck."
5,Comedy; giggedy!,"Top notch hilarity. I became acquainted with Jesse's comedy stylings from his frequent appearances on Keith and the Girl, and his album is no disappointment."
5,Only 5 stars?? Why not 10?!,"I began giving my 13 1/2 year old Black Lab mix this brand of fish oil several years ago due to a skin problem. She picked up a few fleas that did not mind the flea control medicine she was on. They went on to create an atomic flea party on her rump! The poor thing! I tried so many things before I realized that she had fleas. (I had her on the flea meds, after all!)By the time I realized what the real problem was, her whole rump had gone bald, and red/dry!!! The fish oil was the only thing that soothed her skin and helped her hair grow back. Not only that, but the silly old girl LOVES it!! She will actually sit and give me her paw for this capsule, without even the nicety of wrapping it in cheese!I am a devoted doggie fish oil gal now! She gets a capsule daily to keep her skin happy and her coat shiny!"
5,Sharks are exciting,"Small boys love sharks (ages 6 and 2). My aquatic experts enjoying view master pictures, especially the sharks and dinos."
2,Ineffective and Dangerous,"After trying 21 of the 23 described positions, my wife and I failed to feel any more passion and pleasure than we did before reading this book. I attribute this to her habit of watching television. Reading the book is exciting, especially because of the pictures, but putting these into practice is hard work. Not only is the work demanding, but they're potentially dangerous--especially if you're new at this sort of thing (which we are). Two of the positions really DO work, but we had tried them before purchasing the book. They're the easiest to work with, and the most stress free."
2,Not your first choice,"As my title has indicated, for those who are interested in the French and Indian War, the first choice is the PBS version, not this one.This piece has the run time less than one hour, definitely not thorough enough to cover the whole story of this war. I guarantee that you cannot see the whole picture after you have finished this film. In addition, the making of this film is not so smooth, nor delightful to watch. It, however, gives a deeper analysis on certain parts of this war. For those who have been familiar with this war, this could be a bright side.On the whole, this film could serve as a supplement, not for general-purpose use."
2,I agree with above,"I too found this film far less than comprehensive...not as good as ""The War that Made America"". However neither is excellent. Why with all the detailed DVD's and audio books about the American Revolution we cannot get a decent excellent production on the French and Indian or Seven Years War? I wish I had a few million to put together a documentary. Hell even popular films are few and far betweeen...""Last of the Mohicans"", ""North by Northwest""....doesn't anyone care about North America's first big war or the world's first World War?"
5,Filer kit to have,"Filter kit for 77mm I use with Sigma 24-60 f/2.8 lens. Filters are everything I expected. They fit smoothly on the thread, glass quality is high. UV and polarizing filters do the job flawlessly. I didn't test F-filter extensively yet, but initial shots came out properly corrected.I am satisfied with Sakar and will not hesitate to save money in the future and go with this brand. And nice touch - filter kit came with a very nice hard leather case."
3,Are these Zeiko's Filters?,"Well anyway, I ordered these, through Digi Acc because of the good reviews that it had. I never heard of Sakar but it seemed like a good cheap alternative base on reviews, but I was very disappointed. What I got was 3 Zeiko's filters, rated dirt on amazon. When I did try them on they seem to work fine with photos taken in the morning or indoors, until you use them for night pictures then you see unwanted light trails and halos, glares and everything else. I recently purchased the Marumi UV filter and saw a big difference. The glass difference is like an oakley glasses compared to gas station sunglasses. Save your money for the better filters. I would only recommend these filters as protection for your lens and nothing else.Digi Acc did admit to their mistake and refunded my purchase price, big ups to them for that."
4,collecter's item,"paul leary, the great guitarist for the legendary butthole surfers has made a solo album! he plays all the instruments on it and produced it himself, and you'll notice the skill with which the songs have been composed. there are plenty of guitar solos on this album, which you should enjoy. if you're a big fan of the butthole surfers, i would recommend buying this - if you can find it!"
1,Not as good as it should be,"Not what I expected from the man who rips it to shreds on ""Who was in my room last night."" So much of it is just too contrived. The vocals are terrible, high-pitched, and made my stomach hurt. He plays everything himself, which is admirable, but all of the performances, save for some of the guitar work, lack the gusto I would expect from him. The songs are weird and very hard to enjoy. A lot of forced synth sounds that sound off key and very dull percussion that works more as a metronome and less like an instrument. I found myself skipping to the next song 30 seconds into each one, usually when he started singing. ""Is it Mikey"" is OK, but it is the sole exception. This record is an oddball in any collection, but no worth being put into rotation. Sorry Paul."
2,"""Fireproof""","I didn't particularly like this record, but I can tell it was made by people that definitely know what they're doing. My hat is off to them regarding the nice, thick production. This is a solid, white guy rock album, with few flaws when heard in that context. These guys are confident players, without being flashy. The songwriting and arranging is precise and coherent, in fact they even approach greatness with the track ""Heartbeat Mosaic"". Overall, it's excellently done, just not my cup of tea."
5,Wonderful Lens,"First off i would like to say when I first ordered this item, it never showed, maybe they forgot to ship it. When I called they were very nice and they told me they would send another one for next day delivery (no extra cost) I received it yesterday and I was trilled. not only did it fit, but I have a DMC-FZ8. I put it on and it was a perfect fit. the only flaw is that my camera's flash isn't tall enough and because the lens extends so much it causes a shadow. but that is the least on my worries.im very pleased with the photos it takes with the fisheye distortion, and it's VERY cheap so well worth getting.here are two pictures i took:http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v610/chels31889/fisheye/P1000758-1.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v610/chels31889/fisheye/P1000763-1.jpg"
2,Lightweight,"Reads like an extended entry in ""The People's Almanac"". Superficial treatment of famous cases and too much coverage of non-attempts. Hinckley thinking about going after President Carter gets a full entry."
1,My Opinion,"This phone is a really lousy cellphone. First of all, the reception is terrible. You can't hear anything because it's so fuzzy. When I compared its reception to a Motorola Razr V3, the Razr beat it outright.Then, after after about 8 months of having it, the battery proceeded to leak acid all over my bag and the phone. I am lucky I didn't burn myself.Then Nokia refused to help me out and told me that it was ""out of warranty"", which is ridiculous because I bought it in January 2007.If you want a nice, boring, simple phone, with no bells and whistles like a camera or whatever, then I recommend the Samsung T-209. My friend has that and she likes it."
1,There are no good headsets for this phone,"Come next January, California law will require headsets when using cell phones in cars. THERE ARE ONLY THREE HEADSETS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PHONE, AND THEY ARE UNIFORMLY TERRIBLE. Despite what the plantronics website will tell you, none of their headsets work with this phone (except one very sub-standard earbud-type)--I know: I plugged every single one of them into my phone, and they didn't work. None of the Jabra headsets work with this phone. There are two ""earbud"" headsets that work, and one horrible over-the-ear headset (you can get this one here at Amazon for under $10, if you wish to throw away $10). They are all unusable if you have any road noise at all in your vehicle. If you plan to drive with this phone and want to use a headset, get something other than the Nokia 6061."
1,1 word... GARBAGE!,"I love ""The Glove"" (Gary Payton), but if you wanna break into the movie scene, please avoid STINKERS like this one!This movie started with an idea and suddenly entered absolute stupid mode! The cause? Somebody forgot to deliver the rest of the script to the friggin director, but hey ""we're on a budget so let's just keep filming away while we wait for the rest of the script to arrive""... guess what, ""rest of the script"" NEVER MADE IT!!You want black comedy? Pick up some CB4 (only on VHS as I write this), pick up some Original Kings of Comedy, pick up some Def Comedy Jam (there up to 4 volumes on DVD), pick up some Chris Rock: Bring the Pain, pick up some House Party flick, pick up some early Eddie Murphy flicks (Coming to America or Distinguished Gentleman, etc), pick up some... you get my point. Hell, Bulworth was 10 times better than this junk (kind of the same premise, but somewhat smarter, and had a heart).The Breaks? Nah, it's already broken!"
4,If you like FRIDAY you'll love The Breaks,This movie has many similarities to the comedic and cinematic style of Ice Cude's FRIDAY. If you're in the mood for a good laugh pick this one up.
5,Rachel's Opinion!,Hey guys! I was flicking around on the channels when I came across this movie. I had no idea what it was but it caught my attention and I decided to watch it. I thought it was hysterical! The acting was so good and the plot was awesome. Now I missed the beginning maybe half hour to 45 minutes of it but I caught on completely after a few minutes. Mitch Mullany did such a good job in this and he looked very good in it as well! I went online and tried my best to find out what the name of this movie. Reluctantly I did and I hope to own it soon because it is one funny movie! Great job you guys!
5,this movie was the bomb,this movie was non stop belly laughs thought out i didnt want the movie to end
3,Break it down,"This was a cute movie. Light heartedly spoofs black street culture as seen thru the eyes of a white boy raised by a black family. While this is no ""Jerk"" it had its funny moments.A special appearance by funk legend George Clinton in a jailhouse seen that has a cute black knowledge Q&A game show segment.Many movies are spoofed along the way. Most notably, ""Pulp fiction""Some funny bits, but its no ""Friday"" with Chris Tucker.But hey its only 9 bucks, what do you expect?"
5,This Movie Rocks!!!,"The Breaks is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!!!Everybody should see this movie.All in all, this movie rocks!"
4,hilarious,"This movie is hilarious but maybe not for everyone. If you can take a joke, this is a great movie."
3,Not all that great!,"I read the reviews for this movie and I thought it would be a good buy but I was disappointed. After I watched it once that was about it for me. Since I brought it maybe I will watch it again so it won't go to waste but I wish I would have watched it on TV first, that way I could have saved my money!"
4,Great... but not perfect,"I play this CD a lot, and I love it, but I wouldn't label it as perfect.Here's why.Tanya's vocals are strong, but sometimes I think her voice does not suit some of the songs on this album. For example, in ""Firequeen"" her voice does not soar as much as I think it should.The pictures. I don't concentrate on image for music I like, but the pictures were very... how shall I put this... strange. It was like the pictures were one big joke... they make me either cringe or laugh; they are so... I wouldn't say hideous, but just plain strange.All in all, this album is not as good as their latest, ""Crucify my Heart"", but still satisfying. It's well worth your money, so buy it."
2,Not useful,"After buying these cards I realized that the real study value of flash cards is making them for yourself. That has to account for at least half of the learning that you do. These pre-packaged cards are too general, cover too much material on each card and really didn't work for me because they weren't tailored to my specific needs. I ended up making my own the same way that I always do. Live and learn."
2,"Maybe for review later, but not for studying","As a Biochemistry graduate who took Organic Chemistry and went on to TA it for two years, I found these to be unhelpful in the process. The material was structured somewhat sensibly, but in a order very different from our textbook. This made using them more work than it was worth, as our in book chapter summaries were far more useful. These have sat on the shelf and collected dust for years and I don't foresee them ever becoming useful. On a side note - they have a horrendous chemical smell from something in the production process.If you're looking for something to help you succeed in O-Chem, buy a Molecular Model kit or a Study/ Solution guide for your textbook. These will actually be helpful, while these study cards will likely be of little use in conjunction with a course."
1,What a colossal waste of money!,"These cards don't help at all. They are basically just an abridged text book (paragraphs and all) printed on 200+ separate cards. In fact, my textbook has more useful summarization tables, examples and diagrams. Furthermore the cards themselves are bulky and cumbersome to hold. If I hadn't taken the plastic off, I would take them back."
1,not very helpful,"I purchased these cards hoping to improve my understanding and also to use them for reviewing before tests in my organic chem 2 class. The cards were not useful for either task. If you don't already understand the material from class the cards won't help clarify material. In addition, many of the reactions were not even covered by my instructor, particularly in the aldehyde/ketone section of the cards. This could confuse the heck out of someone. These cards might help you review but won't help you learn or understand."
1,sound like u trying to sing...This is so sickening,Shani has to be the worse role model for anyone. She looks more like a hooker then a 25 year old. Why can't I give this CD a zero? Bad Recording and very bad voice!
1,VEry Poor sound,This album is just a bunch of stupid recordings that Shani made. Every song on this album sounds alike and doesn't show anything new. Change your producers and sound... YOu are very bad!
2,I have to say sorry!,"In the search for her song I have spend so much time, and in the end I was very disappointed by her English CDs. Don't get me wrong she is very talented and has a voice to let you dream. The reason for me to search for her song is the one called ""Somnia Memorias"" it is the best song to date; I just don't know why she couldn't put this one on."
1,no,when i heard this cd at a friends house and i have to say that i never want to listen to it again. and you won't too
4,Pure Cheeze,"OK - If you're looking for Easy Rider or some kind of epic.. this isn't it. But if you want a good party movie if you have the kind of friends that watch(ed) MST3K then this is a gold mine! Watch as Evel gets tough with a slim ball promoter! Help alcoholic Gene Kelly regain the love of his 9 year old son! Tackle Drug Lord Leslie Nielsen in a Motocycle Vs. Porsche chase! See Evel womanize his way with a photographer sent out to shoot his deadly last jump! Hear Evel equate the horror of illeagal drugs to Nitro in cars! Friends of orphans and Nuns alike, Evel does it all!Shame that the DVD cover was photoshoped... the original poster ( and VHS box) showed Evel launching into the air from a ramp that was a giant hand gun."
3,Behold the Power of Knievel!,"Heinous drug dealers want to use the famed stuntman's body as cover for a major drug smuggling operation, huh!?! On the side of good is the one and only Evel Knievel, backed up with Lauren Hutton, Gene Kelly (!!!), and Red Buttons (!). The bad guys are a bad movie buffs dream team - Leslie Nielsen, Albert Salmi, Marjoe Gortner, and Cameron Mitchell (with a sprinkle of Dabney Coleman tossed in for flavor)! Believe me, you WILL be in heaven watching this. Although Irwin Allen is not mentioned on the credits (unless I just plain old missed it) all of his standard production team (Harold Kress, L.B. Abbot, et al) are accounted for. Consider it the greatest bad movie Hal Needham never made. Recommended for those into such things as these."
5,"Viva knievel,,the legend comes to dvd..","Awesome baby..Viva Knievel coming to dvd its about time,Evel Knievel was the coolest an greatest superhero ever.Can't wait to see it on dvd..I hope they give it some extras.One of my favorite movies of all time."
1,Viva Knievel 1977,"He?s powered his Harley over Autos , Mack trucks , snarling lions , seething infernos and plummeted headlong into a Canyon . But if the mob has its way , his next incredidle leap will land him six feet under . Death-defying legend Evel Knievel (1938 - 2008) becomes a man-in-jam when crooks use the road show as a front to smuggle drugs . A stellar cast gives full-throttle support : Gene Kelly (1912-1996) as a rummy bike mechanic , Red Buttoms (1919 - 2006) as a sleazy promoter , Leslie Nielsen (1926- ) as a murderous mobster and Lauren Hutton (1943- ) as a photographer who trades barbs-and-hearts-with Evel .Througout this high-speed adventure , Evel does things with a motorcycle that few-if-say-any-can match , leaving purseus in the dust..and breatless VIVA KNIEVEL viewers in hog heaven ! Is this a good movie ! , have you read the story ! , in my judement this is waste of time watch this movie . High Quality digital transfer"
3,Good 70's Flick,"This is one of those films that is so bad it's good. Evel Knievel stars as himself in a war against drugs and corruption. On his trek to rid the world of this evil he drags Lauren Hutton and Gene Kelly along the way. Some of the reviewers, calling this the worst film of the 70's, are obviously taking the film way too seriously.To enjoy Viva Knievel, leave your brain at the door, and start up your engines!"
3,Where's the DVD??? ;-),"Saw this on late night TV recently, and what a hoot! Movie just screams 1977 at top volume. As mentioned in another review, featured is the nutty grocery store clerk from ""Earthquake"" as a drugged-out aspiring stuntman. He meets his doom when he tries to impersonate Evel on a jump. The funny thing is Evels spare leather jumpsuit fits him perfectly despite the approximate 70-pound difference between the two! Leslie Nielsen as the villain is existentially comical. Check out the 'car phones' the baddies use to communicate, they look suspiciously like a GE trimline kitchen phones lifted from the prop department. Knievel made this about 5 years too late, when he had pretty much had it as a celebrity. Lauren Hutton, Gene Kelly and Red Buttons all get dragged under the bus, so to speak, but it's all in good fun. The ultimate stunt would be to jump over Evels ultra wide lapels, now that would be something!"
3,Sort of like an Elvis movie with no singing,"Okay, it's pretty cheesy, but it is actually pretty watchable for the price if your expectations are not too high. At one point Evel tries to scare the bejesus out of Lauren Hutton by putting her on the tandem seat and taking her on a wild ride of wheelies and the like ... that part was pretty funny. A special treat is former child evangelist Marjoe Gortner in the role of a druggie daredevil."
2,just bad,"I'm a big Evel fan so i had to see it, good or not. I suppose I don't have the same appreciation for bad 70s movies the other reviewers do! Evel's a decent actor but the movie is so cheesy its like a typical bad made for television flick. This lame script makes me think that some greedy marketer invented it strictly to make money exploiting Evel's popularity. I viewed this fully aware that it's campy but i was bored. Sorry Evel, but youre still cool in my book."
1,Disturbing,"When I read the introduction, I had high hopes for this book. However, the book has some very disturbing parts. For instance, talking about where children will live when parents separate, Gardner brings up that some children end up in boarding school and foster homes. I was skeptical about that, but continued on. When he said that many foster homes are bad, I wondered if he considered what kinds of things he was telling these children. From my experience, children of divorce have enough fears and ghosts. They don't need an ""expert"" putting more fears into their heads.I was also upset by the notion that he suggested that some parents don't love their children. While he may be correct, I don't feel that his planting the idea in their minds is going to make them feel any more comfortable with their parents divorcing.I did not allow my child to read this. With all her raw emotions, I felt it would be abusive on my part to expose her to new, unnecessary fears."
2,Not The Best,"I looked at this book on the recommendation of my counselor. I don't think I'll use it with my kids. It's older, so it talks about the non-custodial parent not being involved at all, and possibly not caring. It also mentions that parents can hate their children. Those aren't terms I choose to use in my parenting, and regardless of my husbands faults, he will certainly remained involved in the kids lives."
1,the boys and girls book about divorce,This book is awful. It is hateful toward parents and I would never recommend that a child read it! It is ugly and negative and has no value for helping a child heal from divorce!
1,Find something else,"Don't buy this book. It was written in - when? It reads like it was written in the 50's although I think it was in the 70's. It's really a terrible book, wasn't helpful at all even though a counselor recommended it. What a total waste of money it was for me."
4,Nice for the price!,"I am very pleased with this $30 lens, really was not expecting to much but it is know a wonderful new tool for my bag. With my Lumix FZ50 there is a circle around each image - I just shoot and crop within the workable range I know know and get some very neat stuff!"
3,I'm glad I read this anyway,"This was a rather difficult book to read; not so much from any fault of the author, but rather resulting from an effort to comprehensivly cover a topic for which relatively little is known. I found this book provactive from an emotional point of view; the primary sources certainly make the reader appreciate the devastation that must have occured to the (not so?) innocent by-stander. However, the book suffers from a whopping lack of focus in areas, and becomes somewhat repetitive. In addition, the theses of particular sections are often obscure, as are the conclusions. Despite this, ""Inside War"" is a wonderful book to read, although I felt that it was stuck in a nether region between a descriptive listing of primary sources and a thesis driven examination."
5,Very informative!,I read this book to my son's classroom - it was a great way to introduce Chinese New Year topics and discuss them.
5,Awesome,This is an awesome movie. I ride myself and being female and ridding can some times get alittle scechy...but not for the chick in this movie. this is a must own for all you disney movie freaks.
5,This is not just a ordinary book,"If you have read Harry Potter then your sure to like this book....It's packed with suspense, fiction, magic, romance & a whole lot of evil. I haven't read The book before this one... The Book of three but I assure you it's probaly just as good.If you don't believe me then see for yourself..... even Harry Potter might learn a few things from The secret of the Stone..... I know I did...."
4,Watch out for the 3rd Book,"I've read both chapters and it's so interesting, intense and...Wow! I can't wait for the third book to come out. It's something like Harry Potter only it's a bit like the olden days even with Walker and Zoe in it. I Like It in fact, I Love It!"
4,"If you HAVE to wear a condom, this is the one...","If you HAVE to wear a condom you'd be hard pressed to find a better one. Check expiration dates when your batch arrives, some of mine had a less than a 6 month shelf life when I ordered them. Imitations made by other brands are not worth the money."
1,Condoms arrived open,"Do not purchase! I received my order in a bag, with the condoms not in any sort of manufacturer's packaging. Okay - that's fine, I assure myself. What's not fine, however, is that the vast majority of the condoms' packets were fraying at the edges. This left all of the packages extremely well lubricated to the touch, but it also scared me out of using them. I'm actually wondering if this company is secretly militantly pro-life. Do not repeat my mistake!"
5,Big Improvement on the Straight and Narrow,"I'll keep this brief.We all know what condoms are. We all know what they're supposed to do. That being said, this like every other condom out there serves the purpose.However, Inspiral goes a step further, especially for the man in your life.The selling points about improving sensitivity, friction, etc., all hold up.And it does improve the lady's experience as well, as compared to other condom options.If you're looking for a prophylactic alternative to hormone BC or the regular 'straight and narrow' cousin of this condom, I'd highly recommend this to anyone in the market."
5,Dope!,Really dope early 90s southern gangsta rap. Excellent production and Big Mello sounds like a southern gangsta Big Daddy Kane. R.I.P. Big Mello.
4,Technically good but not engaging enough,There's so much right about this movie but for some reason it just doesn't keep my interest. It's the same way I felt about the Brad Pitt Jesse James movie: there's a high amount of elements which are perfect but it doesn't create an emotionally engaging movie.
1,If you know how to turn on a computer don't get this!,I'm very displeased with this CD. It might be helpful to a person who knows nothing at all about computer operating systems. If you know how to get around in Windows 95 98 or Macs OS; Don't get this CD. I spent on something I thought might help me and the product failed.
4,Dewalt 12v Saw,"Great portable saw for trim work, but could use the 14.4 or 18v for extended 2x work. Nice and light for not lugging a 10 pounder up a ladder."
3,Not Very Powerful,"This saw hasn't lived up to my expectations (unlike the many other Dewalt tools I own). It will cross-cut 2X lumber, but only with some effort. I can't get it to rip a full sheet of plywood without it becoming hopelessly bogged down. I wouldn't recommend this kit for anything other than the lightest-duty cutting. (I haven't tried 18v saws yet, so I'm not sure if this is unique to this caliber or not). For now, I sticking with my corded saw."
3,Good book for the parent who knows nothing,"Perfect for the parent who truly knows nothing about golf. For experienced golfers, it may help prevent you from overwhelming your child with golf."
4,It's not so easy for kids!,"After reading the rave reviews, I ordered this for my art class. I copied the instructions for each of my students and let them try it out. They got REALLY frustrated. These are 7-12 year olds who LOVE to do origami. Even with me helping each of them individually, they still had a hard time. Only one of my eleven students was successful. I'll try again...."
5,Wish I may... I wish I might...,"Those cool little thingies. The Klutz ""Wishing Stars"" pack is one of the best (and most original) craft books out there. For something so simple, they do cause a lot of amusement. Who figured out how to fold these stars anyway? All of my friends want to know where and how I learned the directions to make the pretty, little things. Thanks Klutz, we've certainly had some fun times with them!"
3,dull and expensive,"The paper quality is good, but the colors are a bit dull. Although there are two sides of each strand, sometimes the colors are too close and don't show up very well. Needless to say, I was disappointed by the variations of colors. Also, I think the price is too expensive for 100 stars. I bought it because it was convenient at the time. But now I would just rather cut out the paper myself. It'll take more time and effort, but it will be a lot cheaper and I can choose any color I want to."
3,antiquated,"I have read a few of Denise Austin's books. Frankly, I think her methods are a bit antiquated. The Glycemic Load index that she bases her entire book on is really just a reinvention of the glycemic index diet. Despite the fact that the glycemic load is an improved version of the glycemic index it simply isn't enough to base an entire book on. Frankly, books that do this better are the LA SHAPE DIET or WINNING BY LOSING. All in all, I think Denise is outdated and derivative. Wouldn't waste money on this one."
2,cat didn't like it,"I bought all 3 of these products, the spray, the paste that they eat, and the room diffuser. My cat does not care for the spray, she won't go anywhere I spray it. As far as the room diffuser, I can't tell if that did anything for her or not, and it is not very strong like some reviews say, it has a light citrus/herbal scent. As far as the paste, my cat LOVES that stuff, she starts to meow and comes running when I get the tube out and I put it on my finger and she licks it right off, but again I don't know if it does anything to help calm her down. I bought all of these in preparation for moving to a new apartment and wanted to use them at the new place, I did plug in the diffuser on the first day and had been giving her some of the paste every night starting before the move. It took her a few days to get used to the new place but I think that was just her. So I dont know if these products really work."
5,Life saver!,"I spray it on my bedding (all layers). It has a wonderful scent that I even love, keeps all my kitties peaceful and calm, and stopped one of my cats from peeing on my bed."
1,Doesn't work for intended purpose,I recently bought this product with the assumption that bathing and nail clipping my new kitty would go much more smoothly. This was supposed to give me a somewhat calm and tranquil kitty but instead she wouldn't go near anything that I put it on and was just as unruly during grooming. I guess if I bought it to keep her away from things then I could say that it worked but I didn't for the intended purpose. Maybe it might work on someone elses cat but for my Persian and Himi kitties it didn't
3,Hard to notice if it really works,"I have used this product in my bedroom 4 times now to try and calm my cat. She's 9 months old and very unpredictable. Some days she is lazy as Garfield. Then all of a sudden she starts bolting through the room like her bottom's on fire and can't find a bucket of water to put it out. Those are the times I have sprayed this product on her bedding and pillows. I also spray it around my own bedding to try and calm her. My room smells herbal and I enjoy the scent some, but she still acts like a nut. She calms after about 30 minutes or so. Was it the spray or was it her just finding that bucket of water to douse her tooshy? Your guess is as good as mine."
1,Absolutely no effect,My cat is very aggressive towards guests coming to my house. I was hoping that this spray would help make him less agitated. But it did absolutely nothing. Although the smell is nice. But save your money and buy a cheapper air freshner.
3,She didn't appreciate it,"I can't say positive or negative here, my cat did not like or dislike this whatsoever. If you want to try it, go ahead, but I don't think this did anything for my girl."
4,"Great product, but not for every situation","Using this spray is a great idea. Pheronomes are recommended in every cat behavior book I have read for everything from cat aggression to litter box problems. I have been using a diffuser for about a month. I also use this spray in places the diffuser can't reach such as the basement, and specific areas the cats sleep or tend to ""hang out."" There has been a slight difference in the aggression issues between two of my cats (I have four). But the real issue in my house is that the main kitty culprit was not raised around its mother so does not understand proper cat etiquette. I was hoping the pheronomes would help calm the situation, but there are still cat fights resulting from her bad manners. But I still would recommend trying it."
3,temporary calm,"I bought this (along w/ plug-ins and gel) for my cat. My mother (and her cat) moved in with me and my cat. It was a brand new place, and we introduced both cats into the neutral space at exactly the same time. How my cat (male, alpha) did not wind up killng her cat (sweet, timid) is beyond me. The fights were horrendous. I tried the plug-ins, a waste of money. I did the gel, more money down the drain. I did the spray, and I tried all these at the same time. The spray would work momentarily, just for the moment. I do have a job to get to, so I'm not able to stand around all day spraying the spray.My cat eventually had to be put on meds."
2,didnt work well,Didn't seem to do anything...my cat didn't want to go near the area for a while after using it...rather disappointed
4,The Careful Cousin,"Both of my sons enjoy the Henry and Mudge series. In this installment, Henry's cousin Annie comes for a visit, but finding a common ground is not so easy. With some effort, and a little help from Mudge, Henry and Annie work it all out and have some fun along the way."
5,Great!,"I was looking for a replacement for everlast bars which are not made anymore and this bar is perfect. It has a huge amount of protein, is very tasty, and relatively low saturated fat."
5,Frog Hair is THE S*%T,"Buy Frog Hair for all of your technical dry fly fishing (5X-7X). I adamantly recommended this product for small dries!! Don't us Frog Hair for everyday fishing, too expensive and benefits not worth the added cost (unless you don't care).I was a full time guide on some very technical dry fly waters in Southwest Montana for ten years, Frog Hair simply put more fish in the net for my clients!"
3,10mm is not 5/8,"The information on this blade says it has a 5/8"" arbor. When I received it the package says 10mm arbor which is closer to 3/8"". So now I have to take it to a machine shop to have it drilled out. I'm sure the blade is fine but beware of the arbor size. Amazon should correct this!"
4,Nothing Broken Here,"A very good hard rock album whose only flaw is a short running time -- but at the selling price that's OK.With the flood of me too hard rock/Metal Rap/Alt Metal bands, it's nice to find a band producing something you want to listen to, for more than three seconds.Comming of Age is very solid effort with strong lyrics and an album that won't bore you after you've listened to it two or three times. Their sound falls into the same neighborhood as Nickelback, without Nickelback's sometimes Bluesy sound.If you enjoy hard rock with a lead singer who can actually sing, check out Breaking Point."
5,Best bands in 2003,"Listen to to breaking point brings a breath of fresh air to listening to music, with the recycled raido waves and every one trying to sound the same few bands broke away from the norm, and I belive Breaking point is one of them this band has the most potential I've seen in a long time. Falling down was one of the songs that cought me by suppise then it was one of a kind which was music to my ears. Over all one of the best CD's I've purchased in a long time"
4,"An excellent thrilling story, one of those MUST HAVE books!","I really love this book, and the previous (Beyond Ragnarok). My favourite character is Ra-khir and Kevral, as well as Tae. Really good story, fast- moving but exciting and definitely not boring. I think the first is slightly better than the 2nd book, but I still LOVE the 2nd (this book) also. Good plot, many unexpected turns, good character setting. Can't wait to read the next book!!!"
3,Not a worthy sequel to 'Beyond Ragnarok',"As a sequal to 'Beyond Ragnarok' it doesn't quite do justice. There are several different interesting storylines going on at once, but they all seem to end up revolving around family values. This book seems to me to be a little more light hearted, a little more directed to a younger audience than her previous books in the prequel series 'The Last Renshai'. By the end of this book you wonder if it will be worth reading the sequel. You know you probably will, just to find out what happens, but it's not going to be anything in the same spirit as 'The Legend of Nightfall'. From such a brilliant author (referring to 'Guardians of the Bifrost') this was a letdown."
3,Worth the read but not the buy,"It'll be cool if you find it in a library, but definitely don't waste your money on it! This is a warning - trust me! I have it - and a bunch of regrets!As with the first book, the cast is motivated and believable, and also like Book One, the plot is slow and tedious and very SUCKY the longer it goes on. The thing shouldn't take, like, five hundred pages! Please, Mickey, kill it off in *Children of Wrath*!A couple of bright things to note, though: excellent details on swordplay and an interesting concept of Law and Chaos."
1,Sad to say,"I ordered one and it doesn't match the product picture . Hoping the seller will e mail me back so I can get the one pictured !! I also have the match mats, those I am very happy with."
4,Fits an '01 Cav easily...,"These were out-of-stock for the longest time, so I was happy I was finally able to order one for my '01 Cav, which completed my blue R-racing interior theme (I've got the full set of floor mats, visor covers, and color-matched seat covers. This steering wheel cover fit on easily, in fact it fits better than the Chevy cover I had on before it, and fits more snugly to the wheel as well. Very nice looking though the blue isn't quite as vibrant as in the Amazon picture but the material has a nice rubbery feel to it, not slippery like some other wheel covers, this one has a nice grip to it."
4,nice,"too bad you can't get this anymore. A nice track, a groove as the title implies. If you're interested, you can also check it out on ""Live on Brighton Beach"" by Fatboy Slim. He does a pretty good mix with that, though maybe not as good as the second one he does, the ""Big Beach Boutique""."
1,"Boring with a capital ""B""","Such a worthless vehicle for some excellent actors. The plot... What plot? It's a comedy that's not funny, a drama that not serious and it's slow moving as well. Not worth the time spent watching and James Spader is my favorite actor!"
1,Buy a map!,"Even before we get to the ""meat"" of the book we run into errors. On page vii he states, ""General Washington's headquarters during the first half of the year was at Morristown, NY."" ... er... NOPE... Morristown as anyone with a smattering of knowledge of the American Revolution knows is in New Jersey. So much for checking our facts Mr. Keller."
4,Isaac Shelby,"The book may not be perfect, but Isaac Shelby was a great man, and this is the first biography I have found of him. The book belongs in the library of every descendent of Isaac Shelby."
2,When the men from Buffalo were completely batty...,"Caught in stylistic limbo between so-called shoe-gazing and grunge, the Mercury Rev of 1991 were far removed from today's opaque, psychedelic balladeers. Allegedly three years in the making, the punningly-titled Yerself Is Steam teeters permanently on the verge of complete chaos. Now-departed vocalist David Baker had an irritating line in ""arty"" monologues - Einar from the Sugarcubes with a different accent - and melodies seldom poked through the feedback and flutes. ""Coney Island Cyclone"" is strident pop amidst a blizzard of guitars, and ""Chasing A Bee"" has a lurching, stoned charm. Elsewhere, there'a an overdose of self-conscious goofiness, while the closing ""Very Sleepy Rivers"" is an insufferable racket that outstays its welcome by a full 10 minutes."
4,Good reference work for the average gardener,I read the book and it contained all the information that I was looking for and a lot that I wasn't looking for but was glad it was included.
5,Great for tree pruning in particular,"Have a large property with lots of trees that need shaping and pruning and this baby makes it extremely easy to get the job done. Fits all SawsAll blades. Really eats the battery charge fast, so you need at least 2 or 3 conventional DeWalt 18v batteries to keep it running. I'm old so I can only stand to clear brush for about 2 batteries worth of time, but this unit makes short work of even heavy branches so I get a lot done. Plenty of power as long as the battery lasts. I recommend it."
4,Great value,"Price was terrific. I already have a few batteries and chargers. All the big box stores are selling this item for @ $200 with a charger and battery, I dont need any more. Got it a few days after I ordered it for 1/3 the price!"
1,Piece of Junk,"Bought this saw for my dad as christmas gift and it worked for short while, 6 weeks. My dad used it lightly and was never even dropped. Went through the channels with seller and amazon no help. Very disappointed with amazon. If I had bought this at Home depot, lowes, costco or at wholesale club they would have made it right. Really sucks. Think twice about purchases like this no recourse."
3,"Promising, but unsatisfying.","After a freak accident, Austen Bandy begins to experience disturbing hallucinations even though his doctors tell him he's alright. The novel follows his journey as he tries to find either a cure, or an explanation, for his condition.I found the mystery interesting enough to want to keep reading, but the story takes far too long to go anywhere, and I was continually distracted by Koja's bizarre writing style, which I think works well in her short work but becomes tedious in a full length novel."
4,This live setting presents Frishberg at his best.,"On ""Live At Vine Street,"" Dave Frishberg exemplifies his skills as an entertainer. Nine of his clever, witty songs are interwoven around a piano medley which allows Frishberg to display his formidable talents as a pianist. Frishberg's dry wit is evident in most of the song's, but he also proves that he can be serious and poignant on ""Long Daddy Green"" and ""Eloise."" The best of the predominant lighter tracks are ""You Would Rather Have The Blues"" and ""Blizzard Of Lies."" Also delightful is ""The Dear Departed Past,"" Frishberg's ode to nostalgia."
3,A mixed bag.....,"This movie has action, suspense, plot twists, computer hacking, and John Travolta. So, how can it miss? Perhaps by overdoing the action, suspense, plot twists, etc. etc., it becomes almost a parody of the genre. But, if you like that sort of thing, suspend your disbelief for 90 minutes and enjoy! Travolta's character is a badguy/goodguy who thinks that the ends justify the means. In his supposed quest to defend his country he resorts to mayhem, murder, extortion, and any other tool which will support his goals. He hires a convicted computer hacker to transfer a large amount of money to support his activites and lures him into working for him by promising him custody of his 10-year-old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife. Most of the plot is pretty unbelievable, but things sort themselves out and a little plot twist at the end leaves you scratching your head."
4,Enjoyable movie,"the moment i loved this movie was after i saw the explosion scene in the beginning... it was amazing!... seein it in the theater with the big screen and the full sound effect... i was so amazed... i wish i had a camera with me to take little photographs or something... and the scene where the guys got shot through the not see through glass was very stylish and i enjoyed that part too.. i like the sound effect used... overall this movie was enjoyable to watch.. i wasnt dissapointed at the end, Hugh Jackman is such a great actor, after x-men, i truly respected him and his skills.. well maybe Gabriel was a magician himself or something... they made the 1 minute hacking scenes very intense... the music with Paul Okenfield was good..(i forgot how to spell his last name) blah blah blah isnt htis such a bad review? IT WAS A GoOD MOVIE, INTENSE SCENES, AND GREAT SPECIAL EFFECT SCENE!"
4,Swordfish,"Felt like a mix of Matrix & Speed with a bit of No Way Out thrown in. Overall, I very good movie that is definitely a watch for thriller/sci-fi fans. It seems illogical at times and has overblown images, but it's nothing gruesome/vivid like the images of Saving Private Ryan. As an old-married type, the wife could only take the first 5 minutes before she went on to better things. Not a date movie unless both are hard core sci-fi fans."
5,"A Strong Cast, An Intense Movie","Don Cheadle, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, and John Travolta star in this movie. Nice. Very nice. And what about the plot? It's there, and it's tight. This movie has an up front in your face style that doesn't let up for the entire length of the movie. You find yourself rooting for the bad guy because he's just so damn cool, but also rooting for Jackman's character because you want to see the good guy win. Riveting all the way to the end. Highly recommended."
3,Not as great as I expected,"I watched this movie because I tend to like Hugh Jackman's movies, but was a little disappointed. It was an okay movie, I guess, but there are many that are much better."
1,Swordfish,I have tried to download this for 11 days. The process stopped and re-started 4 times. do not use UNBOX VIDEO it is customer un-friendly and the support people can't even understand or speak English! It's quicker and easier to go to the video store and buy the movie!!!!!!!!! WARNING DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY
1,Revolting,This rates among one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The action and sex feels like the writers had a checklist and they shoved it all in to check everything off the list.
5,You'll either love it or hate it,"Basically, you'll either love this one or hate it. It's amazingly simple, and it has no hidden meaning. Its precisely what it says it is: a movie about an ex-CIA spy who steals $9.5 billion from the government to fight terrorists. This isn't your standard action-thriller. Rather, its a mix of techno-thriller, action, and sex. Shortly after the beginning of the movie, the hero-hacker is forced to crack a difficult code while getting a blow-job, with a gun to his head, as a test of his abilities. Like I said, you'll either love it or hate it.It has enough interesting plot twists to separate it from typical action movies; but yet, its not complicated. You won't have to think for this movie.I will admit, I was very skeptical at first. I mean, John Travolta with a little thin-beard underneath his lips? That already seemed stupid. But I think you'll find it to be a good movie if you give it a chance."
2,Jeeze ... it's not THAT bad,"...Yeah ... it's true ... John Travolta really looks out of place and Halle Berry is obviously just paid eye-candy. On the positive side though, the script is tight and concise (even if it is a little predictible), Hugh Jackman is really pretty good, and there's a pretty good number of well-shot action scenes.Sure, it's not exactly the next Citizen Kane, but it's certainly worth plunking down a few bucks to rent with a clear conscience....Lighten up a little bit guys..."
3,Don't spend too much on this,"I'm not really sure why this one bombed so much for me. John Travolta, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, lots of explosions, loud music, clever gadgets and plot, but it just didn't excite me like I was expecting it to. Rent it? Definitely, but don't spend too much to buy your own copy."
2,Glitz but little substance,"There's lots of style and flash in this film. A topless Halle Berry---I really didn't see the hoopla over her boobla-------and some interesting special effects with computers and graphics but ultimately its a Mission Impossible episode gone on too long. John Travolta over acts----hopefully on purpose. Halle Berry plays sultry and shocked---two notes, and Jackman plays reluctantly moral. Everyone is ""playing"" something and why is that? I think it's because Dominic Sena's direction is really great here. The use of slow motion and angle shifting is really inspired and it's very difficult to create balance. Great direction may mean lackluster acting or a shoddy script. It takes a lot to bring all three of these elements together into a synthesis. Its a little scary when I actually liked teh special effects more than a film."
3,Action Packed! Lukewarm suspense.,"I love it when Travolta plays a villian, especially a stylish one! And this was a stylish movie fit just for him! I also fell in love with Hugh Jackman in this one. He reminds me so much of a young Mel Gibson. Don Cheadle never gives a bad performance but if you want to watch Cheadle at his best, rent ""Devil in a Blue Dress"". I couldn't believe he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for that one.Ummmm...All I can say about Halle Berry in Swordfish is that it was odvious that she was NOT who the casting directors initially had in mind for her part. She really didn't fit into her role. It was like watching an adolecent girl trying to convince someone that she's ""mature"".Swordfish is nothing new to us action and suspense junkies and it's no ""Usual Suspects"", but it's nice to see all those stunts, those chases, and the sick ""Matrix"" camera angles during that bomb scene at the beginning! To sum it all up, it's worth a look."
4,Swordfish:action and wit personified,"This movie should be considered an action powerhouse.From the beginning to the end I was at the edge of my seat wondering what the next move would be. It follows in the tradition of some of the new fast paced action thrillers of the 90(ie.Speed and The Matrix). Its worth the money, just remember to take your bathroom break and get your popcorn before the start because you don't want to miss a second of this action thriller"
2,I watched it for Drea,"I rented this so I could see Drea De Matteo, and sure she has only a couple scenes, only a few lines, and so on, but I loved her in it. It's cute how they did the irony thing with her talking about parental fitness while she makes porn and drinks and can't even be there when her daughter needs a ride. Also, she get whacked (preparing for when Adriana gets it? HA HA).See this for her, and Halle Berry's boobies, and forget the rest."
2,waste of time,"This is an extremely bad movie. The only saving grace is the special effects, and for that there are many other movies around. Beats me why talented professionals like Halle Berry and John Travolta agreed to do this nonsense. Berry doesn't do much except take off her clothes at every available opportunity. It's a bad rehash of Dog Day Afternoon, with a plot line so unbelievable that one wonders how the actors found their way through it - and then one realises they didn't. A total waste of time."
5,Great Action Movie,"Yes, there are many ways to start off by slaming this movie, but it's an action flick and IT DELIVERS what it's supposed to, many people overlook that. The story is pretty dum , stupid , and confusing, but it's nothing that the action and Halle's boobs can't pay off. It a great action movie, buy it, sit back, relax, and ENJOY THE MOVIE."
3,Dumb fun,"Lets face it folks- this movie has very little in the way of a plot, and even less in the way of depth. Nonetheless, its a good movie to drop in after a long day @ work. There are plenty of explosions, cool toys and attractive women to entertain me for an hour or so. Also, its an impressive home theater film, esp the opening scene. Of course, if you're looking for a film with any sort of meaning or artistic value, dont buy it."
2,Um....NO!,"This movie was AWESOME....LY TERRIBLE!!! Great opening, mild ending, overall 10-15 minutes of good footage. The rest is ... Some megalomaniacs who love Rambo and other ... fast movies might enjoy this one. Anyone with half a brain will be bored out of your mind for the interlude between the beginning and the ending. Other than a rather random 'boobing' the movie is quite dull; I'd recommend renting Memento, Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, Hannibal, even Happy Gilmore, don't touch this one with a 50 foot clown pole."
1,Horrible waste of time,"I find it hard to believe that some people can rate this movie higher than a 1.I'll admit it does have a lot of action -- so if all you want to see are some cool explosions and a cool car chase then sure waste your time on this movie.But in general the plot was not put together at all. Most of the action seemed completely pointless - as in the director was thinking ""Oh this is an action movie - we need to put in a car chase somewhere - hey it can go here."" The same thing for the nudity. While I know a big draw to this movie is Halle - it just seemed so pointless - as it really didn't add anything to the scene. There were several other places where they put shots like that in -- and there wasn't any reason for them.This was one of the few movies that I really wanted to walk out on. I didn't care about what happened - I just wanted the movie to be over with.There are many many many movies that are much better than this!!"
2,Don't bother. Rent it if you don't believe me.,"I bought the DVD after seeing Swordfish in the theater, mostly because I was impressed with the effects. While truly blockbuster in effects, even the talent (and body) of the fine Halle Berry can't support the lurching, smarmy dischord of the Point-Break-rehash script or Travolta's tired, played-out badguy act. It was terrible enough back in Broken Arrow.Save a few bucks and get the only part of Swordfish worth repeating, Paul Oakenfold's wicked cool soundtrack."
1,really bad hacker film,"Try and get this - a hacker who's been banned from going anywhere near a computer for more than a year, manages to hack into a DOD mainframe protected by 128 bit encryption security, ... with a Dell laptop, while being given a blowjob at the same time...The film lost me after that..."
4,'Techno thriller',"This techno-thriller kicks off with one of the most exciting movie openings ever. And rest assured, there is plenty more action to follow. John Travolta is on top form as Gabriel, a government agent turned arch thief plotting a heist to the tune of $9.5 billion from a top-secret government stash. He's aided in his devious efforts by his glamorous assistant Ginger (Halle Berry) and Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman), a well-known computer hacker. Meanwhile, Vinne Jones enhances his Hollywood reputation by playing a physic hitman-what else?All in all, it's a slickly-made action movie that's drenched in testosterone. And although the plot gets a bit obscure at times, there are plenty of big bangs and some decent acting too- and you can't say fairer than that."
2,Somewhat watchable...,"After hearing all the bad hype about this movie, I saw the DVD just to satisfy my curiousity.It was watchable. Some good action scenes but the acting wasn't much to write home about. A good enough movie to watch on a slow night.There's a great piece of dialogue by John Travolta in the very beginning about why Hollywood movies suck, then the movie takes it a step further and ends up proving its own point.It's nowhere near as bad as Wing Commander, though."
2,I wish that happened to me while tapping the keyboards,"Jackman is the new Clint Eastwood but I fear that the film making talent just isn't there to give him his own iconic 'Dirty Harry', an affliction troubling many up and coming Hollywood stars today. His look of bewilderment and horror at the surreal nightmare he's trapped in during the robbery burns itself on your memory. Unfortunately, his subsequent willingness to except his cut of the appalling enterprise which cost the lives of innocent hostages disappoints and disgusts, even if he has a child to support in this barely watchable and frequently ugly would-be satirical examination of 'the ends justify the means'."
2,Not worth it!,"I saw this film in the theaters and really wish I could get my money back. This film was nothing but the producers and directors trying to blow-up as many things as they could. The dumbest scene in the whole movie is Travolta driving in the car, shooting everything up in his way. Don't bother with this one. Save your money and go get lunch."
5,It's never what you think!,"John Travolta, Halle Berry, and Hugh Jackman take you on a wild roller coaster ride of a film. Pay Attention, (or rewind a lot!) or you'll miss something! John creates a manic character who is just sooo evil, and soo funny! He's actually loveable. You have got to see this movie! Buy it!"
3,Halle Berry looks very good,"There is not much of redeeming value here; the movie's biggest shot is a huge explosion early in the show that, except for the bad guys, kills almost everyone else within range (including cops trying to save a female hostage). The main plot? Hacking the US government out of 9.5 billion bucks for the ""antiterrorist"" hero (antagonist?) played by John Travolta. If you pay taxes, you won't be amused...then the hacker played by Hugh Jackman ""hacks"" by playing with geometric images on a fancy computer screen. Is this what hacking means?There are some good things beyond Halle Berry's naked chest; the actors played their one dimensional roles quite well. It takes some talent to make such roles believable to action fans. Travlota, Berry, Jackman and others did that well and I got through the show without daydreaming. 3 stars..."
3,"An eyeful for Hugh Jackman fans, but not much else","After seeing Kate & Leopold in the theatres, I rented this DVD to get more of Hugh Jackman! Well it certainly delivered, but I must admit that if I weren't a H.J. fan, I wouldn't have enjoyed it much. He's really good but Travolta just didn't deliver and Barry was slimy! The best parts were seeing Jackman in a towel hitting golf balls and trying to pass his ""test"" with the blond's head in his lap. The bus thing was too stupid to even believe. Given all this, I still watched it twice."
2,only if you like halle berry...,"otherwise you should steer clear. cheadle gives a good performance (as he did in oceans 11, another not so great flick), and jackman holds his own but more wasted star power with the likes of travolta and berry. another rising star is vinnie jones, the british tough guy who works for travolta's character. if you like the few moments he did have, go see snatch and lock, stock and two smoking barrels, he's great in those movies. if not, you should see them anyway cause they're great movies. anyway, just another high action blow stuff up kill people kinda movie, hollywood (stuff)that actually looked good in the preview. in fact, if you went on the poster alone this movie would get 5 stars, but you can't judge a book by its cover, can you?"
3,Swordfish [HD DVD],"Good plot, excellent cast, challenging concept and Halle Berry what else can a body ask for in a movie?AND HD-DVD made it great to watch"
3,The middle way?,"I guess I fall somewhere in between on the 'drivel-to-drama' scale of reviews herein. I came to the movie with very low expectations, and thus came away not at all disappointed. All in all, it was better than I expected, but less than it might have been.(I'll never understand those who complain about 'gratuitous' violence, nudity, profanity, etc. You see the trailer, you get the idea. Did you somehow think that this was going to be ""Waiting for Godot""? If it's not your kind of movie, then don't watch it!)The overall pace is good, the story line is consistent (if not strong), and there are just enough surprises to keep one interested. It may not be much of a video library 'must-buy', but it's probably worth the rental (or used) price."
3,Great beginning and usual hacker misconceptions,"This movie started great with a scene that I felt was better than ""bullet time"" from The Matrix but slowly went bad from there. I wanted to like it, I really did but Jackman as the hacker wasn't realistic and Berry was just cute eye candy. Rent this movie for the opening sequence (even better than motorcycle scene from The One)and the alternate endings but save your money for the sequel of The Matrix, The Matrix: Reloaded, due out May 2003."
2,...,"not too ecxiting of a flick. it hadz some best parts but itz really ..., stupid pointless flick that is'z a waste of time. the acting i'z teeribel. aand there wwere secens that invloved nudity and curse wirds for no reason. they were just put there to be there. and that soprta bothered me. dumb flick....peace"
1,GOOD GRAPHICS AND STORY!,EXCELLENT GRAPHICS COMBINED WITH A COMPELLING STORY WITH HUMANIZED CHARACTERS! LOVED IT!
3,Swordfish,It was a kind of good movie but the characters don't fit. Hugh Jackman is not a computer nerd. It doesn't fit.
2,context,"If you like movies without any context or theme, movies that weren't worth making, you'll sure like this one."
2,this movie...ummm... not good,"nice movie, nice scene with HAlle, but not so nice plot and definitely not so nice John Travolta!"
2,barely average,Halle Berry with Her vibe can't save this film.John Travolta is still Coasting with another Mail in type of film.this film reminds me of a few different films&never finds itself.it's just a Film that is Grandstanding it's Own Hype for the most part.watching it once was half too much.some decent Action parts is why I give it a two.
2,Bad Bad Bad,"This film gets 2 stars because of the first 10 minutes - including the obviously Tarrantino inspired bit of self-reflexive dialogue. Then the film falls apart and becomes a tired action film - complete with ridiculous ""tech talk"" about firewalls and such nonsense and a flying bus. Miss this film at all costs."
1,I just laughed.,"""Swordfish"" is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I went to see it because my stupid friend thought it looked cool(...). First of all, the plot is just one giant movie cliche: The computer genius having to hack in to the DOD while having a gun pointed at his head and getting oral pleasure at the same time, John Travolta randomly getting up in his convertible with huge guns and blasting people, gratuitous breast shots... By the time we got to the part where they make a getaway on the school bus, my friend next to me just kept repeating, ""This is so bad. This is so bad."" When they got the helicopter to lift up the bus, I told myself they weren't really going to do something so stupid, but they did. The helicopter lifts up the bus???? And the end is almost worse. All in all, I hate this movie. I might actually get it though, just for a good laugh(...)."
3,"This is why DVD players have ""skip"" buttons","Let's not critisize this movie for being stupid, predictable, and borderline boring. Let's also not critisize my embarrassing inability to find a dictionary to check my spelling of the word ""critisize"". This is a glossy action movie that you buy on DVD and skip straight to the explosion, car chase, and Halle Berry scenes. Don't read those other reviews that rip this movie for it's unintelligent and mediocre script. You already know this movie stinks (...). This is just a movie you put in when you want to impress your friends with your ground-shaking 500 watt home theatre system. Based on that alone, I'll give it 3 stars."
4,Sizing Up the Picture,"This is not a review of the movie itself (there are other comments and reviews in this one and the dvd version) but a review of the video transfer of this Blu Ray. This is a good looking transfer in 1080p/VC-1 video, colors are very well saturated, blacks are rock solid and the contrast is really good. The audio is in English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and encoded at 640kbps. It has a lot of sorround effects specially in the beggining with the 'Matrix'-esque ""girl with bomb explodes"" sequence. That sequence in particular is the one you can display to show your blu ray player.The bottom line... it is a nice (but not excellent) action film that will look good in Blu Ray, specially beign one of the first who came out."
2,"GREAT opening, races downhill from there.","The killer opener, filmed in downtown Ventura, CA just blocks from my house, absolutely takes your breath away. A stunning spin around the explosion of a hostage and the accompanying damage that goes through walls & around the entire scene leaves you heaving in your seat & gasping for air. However, by the end of the film it ends up feeling like a broken promise. You expect this truly stunning, rollicking action ride, but for all the pyrotechnics and Travolta/Jackman/Cheadle/Berry star power, it's a yawner. Throw in some really stupid pseudo-geeky computer stuff that any real hacker would scoff at, a little kid in danger (always a cheap, stupid, easy way out for a screenwriter), and a gratuitous shot at Berry's really-not-that-impressive rack and all you have is a 2-hour waste of time that leaves you wondering what else you could have rented.For God's sake, don't waste your money."
3,Mildly enjoyable,"You remember that Berry, Travolta and Hugh starred in it but that's about all you will remember! It's an entertaining movie but it's not a great film that demands repeated viewings."
3,Bad movie with excellent sound,"Let me begin by telling you that this is a bad movie. So this review is not about the movie itself but about what I liked about the DVD. The sound is just great, especially in the explosion and car chasing scenes. Also, Halle Berry is beautiful and this movie shows her like never before. So, if you like action movies, can enjoy good audio and think that Halle Berry is a gorgeous lady you should see this movie."
2,Did it really have to be THIS dumb?,"Slick and savvy terrorist Travolta recruits ex-computer hacker genius(Hugh Jackman)to transfer billion dollar funds from a forgotten account. This, of course, can't be done without guns and explosions galore. Tiresome action yarn with money to burn takes a mildly intriguing notion and loads it with costly but silly stunt pieces (eg, a city bus being flown around by a helicopter). MATRIX style 360-degree slow-motion track of a hostage explosion at the start of the film is its only highlight. Halle Berry got paid a million to be seen topless for a few seconds."
2,If there is nothing else on...,"After the first hostage explodes pepperinga city with ball bearings, the movie grindsto a halt. While I enjoy watchingJohn Travolta dance, another remake of thepsychotic villian so aptly played in BrokenArrow starts to grate.Most hackers I have met as a computersecurity engineer are nothing like the oneportrayed by Hugh Jackman.The other actors were not memorable to me at all.This movie seems to have expensive special effects,but I got a sense watching it that the specialeffects were done first, then a script was throwntogether to tie the special effects together.The plot twists were nothing compared to the beautifulweirdness of movies like The Matrix...."
1,just poor,"I want to know why the Finnish characters in this film were speaking german! There are a reasonable number of people who speak german and finnish in this world to call BS on that.Just stupid. *maybe* rent this, but only if you have 2 hours to waste on a dumb movie that doesn't even fall into the humorously bad movie category."
2,This Sword is as Dull as Can Be,"Swordfish is a high gloss, low concept action film without a smidgen of reality. Everything in this film looks completely fake; from Halle Berry's bare breasts, to John Travolta's laughably inane attempts to speak cool dialogue, this film is a cheap Hollywood product all the way through. Think of it as Lethal Weapon without the funny diagloue, Speed without the tireless momentum, Spiderman without the heroic prince. Think of it however you want... just don't bother seeing it."
1,Swordfish - a true stinker,"This movie has just hit the cinemas in Denmark. I went to see it with some friends. We all agreed that this movie should have been sent directly to video/dvd.There are so many cheap effects in it that it's amazing. There is only one actor in the movie that knows how to act, and that's Travolta. All the other actors performances are pathetic. And the 'plot'... is just an excuse to go from one predictable action scene to the next.My advice is to avoid this movie like the plague..."
2,not worth to spend time for,no story-lines. .. just a accumulation of erratic thought..not a good movie at all..funny how Travolta gets everything only at last moment..
1,What a bunch of TRIPE !!,"This movie is a discgrace. Shame on you Travolta !!! Of course, we couldn't expect much more from Hugh Jackman, considering his extremely limited abilities as an ""actor"". The only thing in this movie worth seeing is Halle Berry, you know what scene I mean. Other than that, this movie has a crummy plot, horrible acting, and the special effects are not that good either....crummy, even for an action movie!!! Save your money and buy some toilet paper instead, because thats about all this movie is good for."
3,Of manatees and idea balls...,"Speaking as someone with a background in computer science I can personally vouch for the methods portrayed in which a 512 bit decrypting, multi-attack worm, or ""hydra"" is created. Jumping about, mumbling, and feverishly tapping at the keyboard, in a manner similar to a toddler pounding bits of dried cereal into her highchair, while seemingly willing cubes of gibberish to coalesce into a super cube of rotating gibberish is pretty much how it's done in real life!I will now defer to those in the law-enforcement profession, who will be happy to explain why jumping off a cliff in pursuit of a person of whom you wish only to question is, in fact, proper police procedure.Anyway made me laugh and there was Halle Berry boobage - 3 stars!"
4,Puzzling but Highly Entertaining,This is a very good movie but a little hard to follow. The actors give great performances. The story works on several levels and that is what makes it stand apart from other films in this genre.
3,Matrix- NOT,"If you enjoy this genre of films then this is probably worth your time. I saw it because I was interested in seeing more of Halle Berry's work with her new academy award status. In this she proves she can play beautiful manipulative seductress very well. It could have been a good movie- some of the plot ideas and charachter parallels were good- but the movie just didn't pull it off. Baby-faced Travolta was hardly scary or awe inspiring as the evil agent promoting American values no matter the cost. Whenever he tried to come off as demonically obsessed you almost thought you were watching a comedy. If you are looking for a good action adventure that will completely blow you away, skip this. If you've got an evening to kill and love this kind of stuff, see it."
4,Great movie!,"Lots of action, computers, twists, bad guy/good guy. John Travolta was a little over the top, but Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were great and they have excellent chemistry. Basically Hugh, stole the movie. Watch it for the action, Hugh and Halle."
1,Stupid,Stupid and predictable. If you have a moducum of computer knowledge then you should skip this one.
1,Hollywood Cr*p At Its Worst,I was streaming this at no charge through Amazon Prime and it still wasn't worth the price of admission. I pulled the plug part way through when it just got worse and worse with each scene.I haven't seen every movie Travolta ever made - but he must have done this one purely for the paycheck. Trite trash. Save your time and money...move on to your next choice.
1,Not viewable,I bought five dvd's and this one was the only dvd that was not viewable.The disk was not scratched or dirty and my player is not to fault.
2,SWORDFISH SINKS!,This is a movie made for the chase scene crowd. It containsgratuitous sex and is just plain dumb. Not for a thinkingperson.
4,It's all about Halle Berry...,"A very good film, Swordfish, brings to the screen the story of hacker who is hired by the underworld to break a bank code resulting in the release of millions of dollars.Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry (who is GORGEOUS!), John Travolta and the rest of the cast, carry out their performances very well.The highlight of the movie has to be Halle Berry's nude scene at the pool.In short, the setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!Swordfish is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!"
2,Not that many reasons to see this movie,"Well, if you want to see Hale Berry (...), watch this! It's a brief and pointless scene. If you want to see John Travolta drive a frickin' sweet car, watch this! If you want to see some cool and memorable visuals and scenes, watch this!But besides that, this movie was bad. The movie was just plain weird, confusing and...weird! But, the director was smart, show Hale Berry (...) and you'll get some men to go see it and maybe even buy it! Oh, and what's that? Add an awesome car that I want to buy even though I can't, well that's cool. By the way, the car is a Tuscan and it's sweet. But, if you want to check out that car, buy Project Gotham Racing 1 or 2 and you can drive it or buy it if you're RICH! Oh, and if you want to chexk out Hale Berry, I think that Monster's Ball shows some stuff but I never saw it! So, just stay away from this movie!"
1,Just a BAD movie,"The only thing I can say about this movie is that it was bad. A bad plot, bad dialogue and Travolta's copyrighted bad acting. I watched this movie because of Hugh Jackman, and he was truly the only part of the movie worth watching. Several times he seemed to be marveling at the horrendous movie he found himself in. I only gave this movie one star because there was no half-star rating. Hugh Jackman fans, avoid this movie and watch him in The X-Men, Someone Like You, or Kate and Leopold."
2,Swordfish,"Directed by the master of flash-trash, Dominic Sena (GONE IN 60 SECONDS), the John Travolta action vechicle SWORDFISH is basically a sometimes impressive yet superficial cyber-thriller, done in the predictable Matrix-style action (Are there actually any recent action films out there that don't have the ""flo-mo"" gimmick?). Halle Berry gets her kit off, ho hum, semi-impressive action, yeah, yeah. Apart from a really awesome opener with big explosions, the rest has a ""been there, done that"" feel about it. It works well if you just want a dumb action flick, but it dosn't provide much more than expensive bangs and ""cool"" one-liners.The DVD extras include feature-Length Commentaries, 2 Behind-the-Scenes Documentaries: The Making of ""Swordfish"" and The Effects in Focus, 2 Alternate Endings, Hidden Features and trailers. Good extras, but it dosn't cover the fact that the film itself is very sub-par. More discerning veiwers would be best to rent an old copy of Bullit."
2,Odd and Disappointing,"This is yet another film delving into the world of hacking. The way that the film was shot was interesting - unusual camera angles, slow motion and effects kept me watching. The costuming of the characters was terrific. The storyline, however, lacked. There were moments the movie was limp and spent too much time on mundane incidents. The acting was contrived and not believable. Don't pay to see this one."
1,Not so bad it's good--so bad it's JUST BAD,"Not even fun. There are movies that are so preposterous you just have to sit back and laugh. Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies. Hugh Jackman seems in pain a good part of the time, and not because of what his character is enduring--but rather what he as an actor is having to suffer through. The other actors seem to either not sense how appalling their dialogue is and how ridiculous the action and plot are, or not care."
4,must have dvd,"well if your looking to have fun,adventure,and some comedy swordfish is for you.If you liked gone in sixty seconds you will like swordfish.there is a great explosion in the begining like no other before.well acted,well directed. 4 stars 4 sure"
1,Absolutely horrible,"This movie is insipid, stupid, and dull. When I saw Gone in 60 Seconds, I thought I had seen the worst movie I would ever see. I was wrong. Swordfish is all flash (and not really very interesting flash) and no substance: terrible plot, worse acting, and awful directing. Hugh Jackman's character ""hacks"" 128-bit encryption in mere seconds. Interestingly, in real life this takes hundred of SUPERCOMPUTERS months to do. I don't want to nitpick, but it wouldn't be hard to come up with plot elements that were more interesting AND more realistic."
4,Great Entertainment!,"While Swordfish may never be a contender for any type of award it is good, solid entertainment. It's the first movie in a long time that I've watched more than once. While this may seem to be a departure from most films where the bad guys lose you have to stop and ask yourself just who are the bad guys in this film. Either way, the view comes ot the winner on this one!"
3,Worth seeing........Once.,"As a general rule, I've always felt that technology doesn't translate well to the big screen. The only two exceptions are WarGames and The Matrix. Swordfish is no Matrix. That scene with Jackman tumbling almost endlessly down a hill....How long did that scene go on anyway? It's an okay rental....but if you haven't seen it yet.....Wait for cable."
2,Huh?,"Okay maybe if you just want to see a few (very few) special effects or to see HER chest, fine. But this movie was SOOOO terrible. It was just a lame attempt to show off some Matrix-like special effects. The most disappointing part was that the movie actually started off pretty really well, with excitement and a great special effects scene. But by the end of the movie you could tell this was put together by a bunch of people who had a lot of cool ideas, like ""yeah we should have a bus get picked up by a helicopter!"" and ""yeah we should have this as a special effect!"" and it never really mattered if the ideas worked with eachother or had anything to do with the movie. Like cheetos, its REALLY cheesy."
2,Is a Puzzlement,"Interesting premise, that a lone-wolf terror fighter enlists a computer hacker to liberate funds to finance the process, the genius does so -- AND THEN they go in, litrally, through the bank's front window, with vehicles, guns, explosives. And there's a helicopter ferrying a full-sized bus. So why the hacker and the whole concept? Travolta is manipulating, Halle Berry is appealing, Hugh Jackman genial, especially with Berry, and the character's little girl. Buy it used and donate to a charity thrift-shop."
3,good cyber movie,"Hugh Jackman is a hack man who is sent to John Travolta because Travolta needs him for a job. along the way we get great special tricked out effects and some good chases. Don Cheadle, Rudolf Martin, Vinnie Jones and the nude Halle Berry also star. the beginning where theres the camera panning around the place when the explosion accures it a good start. also where Travolta explaisn about the world of the computer. but theres some flaws along the way. Jackman must of hand a great time when that girl was giving him the old bob the knob while he hacks away"
4,Swordfish,"Another great job by John Travolta and Hugh Jackman, both are great in this movie... John play such a bad boy so good..."
2,no too good,travolta is the best thing about it a badly written film dont waste your time on this movie all about drugs
2,"""Swordfish"" stinks","Halle Berry appears topless in a scene for the first time, as you know. That is the only memorable thing from this movie, sorry to say. It gets caught up in its own hype and it never goes anywhere. The alternate endings are mildly interesting, but in the end, it's just another bad Travolta film."
4,No Excuse for this Much Ridiculous Fun!,"Before you even START with me, yes I know this movie makes absolutely no sense. The plot doesn't seem to have a beginning or end and each ""twist"" makes a more foolish mess than the last. But what a blast for visuals! **SPOILER ALERT**Just reflect on gorgeous Hallie Berry, complete with the ""it girl"" accessory a tootsie pop--hitting a long, straight drive off the top of the trailer. Or all those wonderful ball bearings, or John Travolta's too silly for words villian, soul patch and affected way of smoking a ciggie! Not too mention the fabulous chase scene and hill roll for Don Cheadle and Hugh Jackman. Pop a BIG bag of cheese popcorn, grab some peanuts and a Coke (secretly dropping some peanuts into the Coke for a sweet/salty treat), turn off your brain and enjoy this DVD feast of lunacy."
5,Clever,From the directing team of Gone in 60 Seconds comes a tale that will have your head spinning when the final blow is delivered before the closing credits. One of the best films of its kind I have ever seen. A masterfully written script that will have you guessing until the end. A must see for anyone tired of the same old good guy vs. bad guy movies where the plot is so predictable and paper thin that you could cut through it with a dull pair of scissors. Hugh Jackson and John Travolta deliver very good performances as wells as Hally Berry.
2,Propaganda,"This movie is an action packed load of garbage that tries to use the ruthlessness of American patriotism to give a cool and powerful image to the American government.This idea that there are these people in America who eliminate any terrorist threat with more brutality than the terrorists themselves is nothing more than an insecure fairytale concocted by Hollywood to make everyone feel safer in a sort of ""they don't wanna fu#@ with us"" kind of way.I don't think there will be a sequel to this movie now that sep 11 has happened."
1,This movie is like John Travolta's haircut...,"...bad. What a waste of time, talent and money. It throws in everything but the kitchen sink: machine guns, rocket launchers, car crashes, big explosions, stylish clothes, computer hacking, Travolta's recycled ""Broken Arrow"" villian schtick, hackneyed dialogue/situations, nudity, etc. But where's the feeling behind it, I ask? You couldn't care a lick about any of the characters or their motives. No more can be said. Avoid like the plague."
1,What a mess,"This is a film created by committee. It's a film that tries to be everything all at the same time, doing nothing well, and creating a storyline that is unbelievable, stupid and frankly boring.There are far too many, so called, ""exciting"" action scenes that lead nowhere except to try and break up the monotony of the laughable storyline.See Sneakers instead."
4,Swordfish; a pleasant surprise,"When I went to see this movie I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised: this movie is awesome. It has obvious action elements, a tease of romance (for the ladies), a bit of technolust, and it is mostly quite realistic making it quite believable as a possible real-life scenario. The soundtrack too is very awesome (techno). I'm not going over the plot as it would spoil it. Just see it, trust me. .... The only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is because its not a cultural megaphenomenon of a movie (you know, like LotR or Star Wars, etc..)"
5,"""The Soul Of A Writer"" is a journey worth taking!","""The Soul Of A Writer"" is not only thought-provoking, it delivers inspiration in the face of adversity. To begin the journey, is to start with the soul, and that is exactly what these authors accomplished. There are no right or wrong answers, just the true and human insights from those who write the songs. How powerful is the human voice and how ever-present is the writer who gives life to it! Truly a world of revelations , habits, and human ancedotes fill the pages of this book. It is a rare find for those looking to identify their thoughts and feelings with other songwriters. Whether you are a writer in full blown success or a writer still in search of that ""first:"" hit, I highly recommend settling down in your most comfortable spot and jumping right in. It may be remarkable what you discover in the ""soul of a writer."""
4,"Exciting, generous DVD","The flavor of the quadrennial Cliburn competition, its tensions and triumphs, is followed by complete stunning performances of Tchaikovsky's First and Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concertos by the two top pianists. I won't give away the unprecedented outcome of that year's tight contest. There are behind-the-scenes glimpses of judges conferring and hosts encouraging. As always, James Conlon, who I've interviewed twice for public radio, is a thoughtful and compassionate guide for soloist and audience alike. One side of this DVD contains the contest feature; the other side, the full concert performances. Rating: 4.5"
3,Supports,"I bought these with the saw, but they are to short to support much. I don't think they are worth the price. I think that a seperate outfeed roller would work better."
3,Not for a DW745 job saw.,"Based on DeWalt's equipment site which listed the DW7441 as an accessory for the DW745 job saw I ordered this support kit. It arrived on the promised date and I immediately set about installing it on my saw...NOT!! As is the case with most DeWalt products this support system was beefy, well made and promised to do a great job....on someone else's saw. It will not fit on a DW745 and can not be modified to do so. I contacted DeWalt support personnel and they admitted their site was wrong and the kit will only work on a DW744. If you have a 744 this would be a great addition."
3,misleading advertising,"We feel mislead. This popped up as an accessory for a saw we purchased. The saw is model 745 and the extensions fit model 744. None are made to fit 745. We are very disappointed that we must pay extra to return this item, since it is incompatible with what we purchased. Be very careful when given recommendations by the computer."
4,Does The job with some adjustments,These table extensions are nice to have when cutting a larger piece of wood and not having another set of hands to assist you. Setup is fairly simple. I did end up adjusting the mounting brackets by making the extension bind up a little to prevent the extensions from sliding out every time the saw is tipped over.
3,good idea but slightly sketchy execution,"this seems fairly decent but not well executed - needs some sort of retainerit doesn't stay in place when you move the saw (have a handfull of small bungees handy)alignment isn't critical to it's use, but it would be nice if there were some way to adjust it!"
4,Nice Addition,"This product was a very nice addition to my portable table saw. It goes on easy, does as it says and makes working with longer lengths of wood a bit easier.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it does flex some when running longer pieces across it and I wish it was made just a bit more heavy duty."
4,Qualit product needs a little improvement,These work great however the dude feed falls out when tilting saw to roll around. If this had a wing but set screw on either one to lock into place it would be perfect. I put masking tape around the tubes to make a tighter fit and lock better into place.
5,Quality upgrade to stock saw,"Quality product, and a great upgrade for Dewalt's portable table saw. It does add a bunch of weight to the saw decreasing its ease of portability, but we are all strong backed carpenters, right?! Anyway, the feed supports were very easy to install (took about twenty minutes) and work very well when working with large lumber. Worth every penny..."
1,Condom broke first time I used it!,"After years of using other brands with no problems, the first time my girlfriend and I used the Inspiral condom, it broke on us which was pretty scary. Hopefully others will have better experiences, but I was not impressed. Buyer beware!"
5,I love this cd still,"exit willie d enter big mike along with scarface and bushwick bill these mugs from texas put out another banging classic crooked officer deals with police brutality, six feet deep talks about black on black violence, bushwick continues his chuckie tales on murder ave, other songs deal with drugs, sex, and murder in the hood my favorite is the last cut bring it on which features the whole rap a lot mob a must buy."
2,Impossible to get out of dispenser,The towelettes were not perforated very well. That made it hard to get them out of the container. For this reason I do ot recommend them.
1,Defective,"This book is defective. It is brand new but was assembled incorrectly and is missing at least 8 pages of designs. I'm not sure if this problem exists with other copies of the book, but mine will be returned. Thankfully, Amazon has a good return policy with defective merchandise. If you buy it, make sure to check for all the pages."
2,Smaller than they look,"I just received my earrings and am not happy. They look like miniature versions of what I see on the screen, and I don't see any dimensions published (now I know why). I will send these back (if the shipping isn't more than the cost!)."
5,Essential,This is the basis of all of Rimpoche's teachings. Amazing and I also refer to it regularly. Arrived in perfect condition and very quickly.
3,Gripping - but ultimately not satisfying,"I thought the book was masterfully written, with excellent pacing and suspense. I really got caught up in it. But like other reviewers, I found basics of the plot seriously flawed. Luxford could have printed his story any time, without permission from Eve - consequently, her reactions were not plausible. Moreover, if someone wanted to press Luxford to print a story, why not immediately kidnap *his* child. And why didn't anyone realize the obvious fact that his child was at risk too and needed special protection? I found the resolution similarly illogical and disappointing. It was like taking a long and interesting journey in anticipation of a marvelous destination. Then the destination turns out not to exist and one must be content with the journey itself."
2,not one of my favorites,"Even though I'm a Elizabeth Goerge fan, I had trouble ""entering into the story"" and buying it. I mean, what kind of mother truly does not care abouth her daughter's disappearance, going as far as not reporting it to the police. This was the crucial detail that made it impossible for me to stick to the full story."
1,The best of Elizabeth George I have yet read !!!,This book is really great! A gripping plot and a lot of suspense! Featuring more of Sergeant Havers than the earlier novels. A very dramatic ending
2,Remarkable book,"I bought this book for a dollar at a library's used book stall. I would never have thought that I'd be able to overpay for a hardcover book at a dollar, but I did for this one. Not so much of a detective novel and more of a soap opera -- with a heavy dose of fantasy. If you're interested in a classical procedural, or even credible characters, look elsewhere."
1,A big disapointment!,The first few chapters are a sure cure for insomnia. After you get through the first half of the book it isn't to bad. The first half of the book could have been done in a chapter or two. I doubt that I will try another of her books
2,Misrepresented item,"DEWALT DW9053 5-3/8-Inch 80 Tooth Paneling and Vinyl Cutting Steel Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch ArborThe referenced saw blade is very difficult to find.I ordered it because my saw arbor is 13 mm and will not accept the more commonly found blades with a 10 mm arbor hole. I have a 5/8"" to 13 mm adapter ring for my saw. Much to my surprise when I received the blade (in record time, I might add) it had the more common 10 mm arbor hole which is useless if your saw has a 13 mm arbor as mine does. Because of the low price and the urgency of my need I do not intend to go through the rigamarole of returning the blade. I have managed to find the proper item elsewhere. I have ordered many items from Amazon and will doubtless continue to do so but my confidence in an items description has been shaken.Thank you,bbaggins42"
5,"You Gotta Have a Goal, Sister!","Read this book at your own risk!! If you are looking for a light read, some fluff that will occupy your time and not your mind, then move along Sister - this book is not for you. However, if you are looking for a road map to personal success and fulfillment, this book is both guide and tool. As Ann and Michelle share their stories and detail the development of the Goal Sister process, the reader becomes part of that very process, and begins envisioning and creating an empowered self. The exercises in the book provide the reader an opportunity to really focus her goal setting efforts; and the best part is - you do not have to do it alone! Not only do you have the support of the authors, but the book also provides guidance on how to identify and invite your very own Goal Sister along for the ride. For women everywhere who have ever uttered the phrase ""Someday I would love to ..."" this book gives you Someday - and it could be sooner than you think!"
1,A Ridiculous Book,"After reading the first 20 pages of this book, I thought to myself why on earth would someone want to publish this prattle. I am sorry I invested the time and the money. The book is need of a good editor and a publisher that knows what it is doing when presenting a book like this. This book should really be called the Failed Sisters. Failed to hold my interest for one."
3,The middle School is much better,I do hv the green book for middle school and it's much better since you can make copies for the class to work on paper. This one it will hv pictures with the Spanish word and kids will hv to rewrite the Spanish word and on the next page it will hv only pics for kids to identify and write the Spanish word.
3,Great for flash cards only,"It would be great for learning vocabulary, but not learning the language. There are a lot of flash aords included with good line drawings."
5,snapshots of the real american city,"This book actually gets at the guts of the problem of social relations between blacks and whites. As gentrification becomes a larger problem in American cities, the economic prospects are shadowing the social issues that are swept under the rug by politicans. The reader gains a sense of the residents of northton and the village and hopefully will understand why we act like we do.(ignorant) Understand the power of this sociological masterpiece and it will bring to light what others do to protect their urban community."
5,Streetwise,Recieved the book in a very timely manner. It came in a better-than-expected state for being used. I have done business with betterworldbooks before to buy used books and haven't been let down yet. 5 star business
1,4-piece Vent Shade,Disappointed in the vent shades. Unattractive external mounting. Returned them. Would not recommend this product. Try other brands for this type accessory.
1,Cannot put four ventshades on a subaru outback wagon!,"Auto Ventshade 94922 Ventvisor 4-Piece Smoke Window VisorThis model was the 'fitted' 4 piece vent set for my 2003 Subaru outback wagon.However, the way the windows are designed, you cannot put four vent shades on this car unless you want to attach them to the window itself!I would like to contact the seller and see if they have a two piece set, but there is no way I can find to contact them directly through Amazon.So be wary of the recommended vent shades for your car - take a good look at your car and how they should be installed before you buy.PS - I did purchase one set from them and they sent me shades for a pickup truck. They did accept the return free of all charges."
5,excellent for immediate level pianists,"I still play from the copy I have had for over 15 years. It is filled with wonderful well-know classical pieces and a few American folk songs. My favorite pieces in this excellent book are ""Spinning Song"", ""The Wild Horseman"", ""Tales From Vienna Woods"",""the Happy Farmer"", and ""Gypsy Rondo"". Most of the songs are at grade level 3, although there are some that are 2 or 4. This is a wonderful book for piano teachers to use for their students."
5,My Favorite Solo Album,This album showed up sooner than I expected and in perfect shape. It is replacing an album with the same name and music that my mother has (she is 82). Except the one mom has is turning brown and starting to crumble. I am very happy to have found a replacement.
1,Not a very stable mount,I've used this on my Romanian and Bulgarian AK's. I found that mount even when adjusted wasn't very stable and wouldn't retain zero when removed.
3,Saw good Batteries Bad,"I have my own repair business and use this saw occasionally and it never fails to have dead batteries when I'm ready to use it. No matter when I charged them last, they will not hold a charge for any length of time. Other than that it's a good saw, but I should have stuck with Milwaukee products for heavy usage. Have had no problems with Milwaukees batteries."
3,"Ok, not great, retelling of Merlin's young life","The Young Merlin Trilogy by Jane YolenA book chronicling the young years of Merlin's life, from foundling, to magician's assistant, to wild child who befriends/adopts Arthur, all the time plagued by magical dreams. The book is nicely woven of many different legends of Merlin, also with the symbolism of birds (i.e. passager, hobby, and merlin) to stand for Merlin growing up and finding his destiny. Unfortunately, even though the book is very short, there isn't really a lot there. It's kind of empty and boring. The odd style doesn't really do it any favors. It's frankly disappointing, as Merlin is a funky dude. Grade: C"
5,LOVE IT.,This is my first Runrig CD. It is amazing. I found the live format to be surprisingly superior to the studio recordings I've checked out- though those are still enjoyable. I find myself wishing I could understand the few Gaelic lyrics.
4,A spiritual look at some beloved stories,"I originally saw this book on the shelf at a local bookstore, and was intrigued by the concept. After all, there is nothing overtly religious about Dr. Seuss's stories. However, they do have strong themes, often defining a basic morality. So it shouldn't be surprising, I guess, that they can be quite easily linked to religious messages. Each chapter in this book takes a Dr. Seuss story and relates its message to a relavant Christian theme. Some of these are obvious, while others require a little more interpretation. I suspect that this material is much more effective when presented as a sermon by a gifted preacher.This is a short book, and a quick read, and is likely to be of interest to many fans of Dr. Seuss's writing, if only to show another way of looking at the beloved stories he created."
1,Gospel or Seuss?,"When you see everything through the eyes of a Christian, it's not particularly surprising to see anything, even Dr. Seuss, as Christian-referential. It would be more honest and instructive to try to understand Seuss clearly as Seuss. Too often trivial endeavors such as seeking honest and clear understanding become irrelevant in the brilliant glow of dogma. If you want to learn about Dr Seuss this might not be the best book for you. If you want to reinforce your faith bias in the context of children's literature, then this book is an example that there is something for everybody on the market."
2,Buy the book instead,"The book is far more informative. I found the pace of the DVD too fast. Also, the photography was far more distant than I would have liked."
1,"May be funny, but not for the right reason","The box states that this movie is ""The Complete Guidebook to Sex and Dating in the 21st Century."" If that's true, then we are living in a seriously troubled century. I honestly just don't understand what this movie has going for it. Most of dialogue throughout it seems forced and there's hardly any character development -- except the ""main"" character, whose part is no larger than anyone else's in the film. I especially could not understand how this movie won a ""Best Comedy"" award; at a few points, I laughed, but it wasn't because of the writing: it was because I couldn't believe how nondescript the film was. It seems like nothing really happens, and then the film has no good dialogue to fall back on.Also, I have no idea who the girl is on the cover, she's certainly not in the movie."
5,A great book,I read this book and the words and sentences flowed like magic. It is very well written. The characters and the situations are very funny. I found the style original and fresh. If you like modern plays with avant-garde technique you'll enjoy this book. The dialogue is out of this world.Maria
4,SWEET LEILANI,"Hundreds of grass skirts swung on swivel-hipped maidens, pineapple was the flavour of the week, and palm trees swayed to the swooning glissandos of SWEET LEILANI....Hawaii, or a glorified fascimile thereof, was back on the screen; that song was being crooned to best-sellerdom by Der Bingle. This little 1937 film was quite a hit in its day. Bing plays the pineapple growers' publicity whiz kid who falls in love with the winner of his Pineapple Princess contest, Shirley Ross. Meanwhile, his side-kick (Bob Burns), had his hands full in more ways than one with Martha Raye, which gave Bing a great comedy back-up. The Frank Butler-Don Hartman story was scripted by them with Walter DeLeon and Francis Martin, and was shrewdly fashioned for the box-office by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and director Frank Tuttle. The supporting cast includes Leif Erickson, Grady Sutton and Anthony Quinn (!)."
3,Out of Step with the Other Reviews,"While I agree that Heston wasn't as good a fit for More as Scofield, one thing I did like about this version was its fidelity to the full play. The original cinematic version strayed from it, especially from the device of having Matthew/the Common Man play multiple roles throughout.I also found that some of the other characters were better developed here: Henry VIII demonstrated more of the desire for More's approval than Shaw's performance; Cromwell was much more conniving and shrewd; Rich was more weak and duplicitous even than Hurt's portrayal."
3,Well done but not close to the first,"It is worth seeing, but the original is superior.This movie will be a little hard to understand unless you have studied the subject or have seen the orginal 1966 movie. The original movie is one of my all time favorites, this is worth seeing too... The subject of Sir Thomas More is a fascinating one. A very noble and upright man..."
1,Terrible,I could not even finish this movie. The actors (other than Chs. Heston) were horrible and their accents were annoying and impossible to understand. This movie takes a very serious and true event in history and makes a mockery of it.
1,I would give this movie a zero if I could!,This movie was horrid!! It was soooooo boring plus Heston's acting in this movie is the worst acting i have seen from ANYONE including acting from my daughters elementary school plays! It's supposed to be humorous yet i didn't laugh once and cringed at the attempts to make me laugh!
4,Great guide to important foods,I wanted a comprehensive list of the Superfoods because I have been trying to include them in my family's daily diet. This is a good book for this purpose. It gives good explanation of the value of eating each food. I definitely recommend this book if you want to eat better.
2,Basic knowledge,"Bottom line: it's nutritionally beneficial to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables! Plus, drink tea.Boring. I was hoping for some juicy details, but what I got was a bland recitation of so-called facts and statistics. The addition of ""sidekicks"" to the ""superfoods"" really lessens the potency of the superfoods' superness.More fun to read a few issues of Vegetarian Times and Real Simple - you'll get similar nutritional info with the added bonus of recipes and decluttering tips!"
5,Fascinating,"An excellent book that clearly defines and explains how these 14 foods can change YOUR life forever! I hightly recommend this informative book on nutrition and lifestyle! Check it out, and your life may never be the same!"
4,SuperFoods RX,Book is informative and gives great advice on the foods that are needed to change poor eating habits. The recipes and ideas are usable. I enjoyed reading this book.
3,So far the book is ok. I have not finished reading due to the holidays.,It is ok so far as these types of books go. Would be able to rate it differently maybe after I finish it.
3,Good info,After reading this book I have tried to change my diet.Hard to eat everything in this book that they claim are the super foods for a long period of time.I eat better than I did before with the info in the book.
4,Changing Your Life,"New genre--the how to change your life book. Some books use exercise, some religion, some work or family--this one discusses foods that will make you healthier, happier and stronger. Superfoods is a great starting point/motivator with excellent nutritional info, clearly and simply presented. My favorite book about life change (in another category) is ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,"" by Bruce Stockler. It's about one man who finds out his kids are more important than his job, money or career dreams--hilarious, honest and insightful. And don't forget ""Zen & The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."""
2,wrong information!!!,The two authors didn't do a good research on a couple of things.For example: According to the FDA yogurt can be called yogurt if it includes L. Bulgaricus and S.Thermophilus and not as stated in the book Thermophilus & Acidophilus!!!!! BIG BIG MISTAKE!!!
4,superfoods RX,some good information about really good foods but could have gone farther. a lot of the foods in the book are nightshade foods witch some people have problems with.
4,Learn To Eat Healthy,"If you are trying to eat in a more healthy way this book is a must. This book discusses each of 14 foods that in one way or another help prevent heart disease, cancer and other health problems. A discussion of each food and its healt benefits is written in a way that anyone can understand. Information about what to look for when shopping for foods as well as menus and recipies make this book a must."
5,Excellent!,"I really enjoyed reading this book and incorporating the superfoods into my diet. The author not only lists 14 superfoods and their ""sidekicks"" but also gives a chapter to each and explains why they are a superfood. Excellent book!"
2,i wanted it to be good,"i was excited to get this book and really had high hopes for it but its just like almost every other health food book out there, ungodly boring. everything you can learn from the book can easily be found online"
4,Super Foods,"Extremely enlightening. how can you go wrong with fruits and vegetables. Even used it to help lose 20 pounds. At 76, and still running a company you want to do whatever it takes stay on top of your game"
5,Superfoods comments,"The book contained a wealth of information on healthy foods and their benefits to the human body. Consequently, my husband & I have changed our eating habits and are losing weight and feeling better for it."
5,Start here to change your relationship with food,"This is the first book I read when I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance last spring. It gave me a strong platform from which to rebuild my daily diet without wheat, rye and barley, and helped me discover the joys of simple, powerful foods. This is NOT a diet book, but an extremely valuable tool."
5,GREAT BooK,"This book is filled with the nutritional information that we all need to be healthy. It's sad how lazy our society has become when we won't even take the time to throw a few things that are healthy together and instead eat processed death food at Mickey D's. Great Book, easy to read, interesting all the way through, easy to put into practice and comes with not only recipes but lists of suppliers for healthy eating."
4,SUPER INFORMATIVE,"SuperFoods Rx is based on ""strong academic science and peer-reviewed research clinical trials."" And it isn't just a food book. The other subjects covered are ""exercise, stress management, faith, friendship, laughter, daydreaming, sleep, and other elements necessary for a longstanding, healthy life."" The recipes are tasty and the book itself is easy to comprehend. The authors include some interesting things in the book such as, ""Consumer alerts"" which prompt consumers to speak out on things like ""less sodium in canned fish,"" or ""alert manufacturers to produce vitamin C supplements with added bioflavonoids in 100- to 250 milligram amounts."" There is also the ""Sidekicks"" list at the first of each chapter. If you don't like spinach or any of the other fourteen superfoods, they recommend a list of substitutes for each. It looks like they thought of everything - health, body, mind and spirit. It's a comprehensive nutritional guide worth looking into that's for sure!Brenda @ MyShelf.Com"
2,China vs US,"This book compares Chinese math teachers to US math teachers. Many of the US teachers seem incompetent. This is required reading for a math training I am taking and the teachers in my class are much more competent than this book portrays. The book also does not take into account that in the US ""ALL"" students are educated in the same schools for K-12."
5,Highest recommendation to teachers and educators,"This is education research at its best. It directly points the way to better classroom preformance, which is ultimately what education research is about. It gives a very persuasive argument that good mathematics teaching must start with a total command of the relevant mathematics. Its implications on the professional development of mathematics teachers should be taken to heart by educators, state agencies, and administrators."
3,stand,"I bought this table with the saw. It is strong and lightweight, but it does not make it easy to move the saw. I bought a wheeled stand for this saw, and no longer use this stand."
5,Awesome,Stand fits saw perfectly. Well engineered so it doesn't tip or slide when trying to push material across table. I use this stand on my concrete garage floor and it stays in place due to the rubber/ plastic stoppers on the bottom of the legs. You buy DeWalt to get the best- nothing less than expected here.
3,Not as much fun as III,"This album seemed to be a lot more predictable than the only other TOG CD I have (which is III). It is still good, it is still Roy Z and friends making great music, it just isn't as exciting as III was to me."
5,Touching and Inspiring,"I have now seen this movie about nine times, and it never seems to fail to touch me. It's an inspiring movie that highlights the issues with race relations that were prevalent in the 50's and 60's (and before), and it is filled with so much symbolism (such as Muhre's bird which Flora explains the uniqueness of at the end of the movie,etc.). It does it in a loving, innocent way that easily reaches children (and the children within us all).~I would highly recommend it!~"
2,Please Stop Faking African Accents,"The only thing I hate about this film is that one of the characters, supposedly from Africa, talks in a very annoying way. This is not how Africans sound, but great film about friendship. I just won't buy it 'cause I know I'll take it back."
3,may be a bit dated,"best for audiences 8-12 years old. very good kid-oriented discussion of racism. The fact that it's based on a true story is lost on the audience, however."
3,Conspiracy??,"A good film with many overlapping theories. Some mention of government conspiracy during a time in history where there was much social unrest, and conflicting issues with the war in Vietnam, government involvement in social issues."
3,One Crazy Movie!!!,"I received this as a graduation present on May 31st, 2008 and I finally finished it last night. For a George A. Romero, it was pretty good, but some parts are really boring. A virus named Trixie has spread through a town, so the military try to quarantine the town. Most of the civilians begin to go crazy and start killing each other and the military A man even tries to rape his smokin' hot daughter! I love the gore scenes. It seemed like a grindhouse film. I'd probably recommend THE CRAZIES!!!"
4,Underrated Classic,"One of Romero's most underrated works, it is more relevant today than ever before. The only bad part about this feature is the...ending. Otherwise, another great piece of claustrophobic horror from Romero. The DVD itself is a must for fans, espeically the great Lynn Lowry interview. Romero's commentary with Bill Lustig is also very interesting."
1,The Crazies,"Wrong version,The effects were nill, the acting was poor.The new version is a 100% better"
1,You will be bored crazy watching this film.,"And I thought George A. Romero's Season of the Witch/Jack's Wife/Hungry Wives (1973) was bad. The Crazies is another nonsensical low-budget film.A man goes ""crazy"", kills his wife, destroys things in the house and the house is set on fire. Now the military is looking for other ""crazies"".The only recognizable person is the child actor at beginning of film.You will also notice some extras from Night of the Living Dead (1968).Followed by a remakeThe Crazies(2010)."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Should've stopped at ""Night of the Living Dead."" This was painful to watch. Terrible story, acting and video quality. Save your money."
4,Don't Drink The Water!,"OK, the government strikes again. This time, a military plane full of a biological agent code named ""Trixie"" crashes in a small Pennsylvania town. The movie starts right out with a dad gone berserk, torching his own home, killing his family for no apparent reason. It seems that Trixie effects the mind, turning it's unsuspecting victims into homicidal maniacs! This is perfect George Romero territory! Soon, the army moves in, herding the healthy townfolk into the highschool gymnasium, while gunning down the infected hordes. This movie would make an excellent double feature with ""Night Of The Living Dead"". Though some of the scenes are rather goofy by todays standards, THE CRAZIES is still good enough for a few scares. Check it out..."
2,Not the George Romero we all know and love,"This movie was not what I expect from a Romero flick. Not alot of the blood and gore that is his staple. The story itself isn't that exciting and neither are the actors really. I will buy all the Romero movies due to my love of most of his work. If you are just a fan of the ""Dead"" series you should pass this movie up. There is no comparison between ""The Crazies"" and the Dead movies!! Not even in the same league."
5,Remove the horror and what have you got?,"What I love about Romero movies (meaning the ""Dead"" series and the ""Crazies"") is that when you remove the horror there is always a great underlying story about group dynamics. The Crazies delievers on this. It is one of the reasons I find myself constantly going back and watching these movies again and again ... And, yes, I watch them for the gore too."
2,"Slightly Crazy for ""Crazies""","This George Romero film, which (like Night of the Living Dead) was filmed in the small town of Evans City, in Western PA, revolves around what happens after a military plane crashes. The residents who come into contact with whatever the plane carried either die or go insane. Of course the government bungles the containment and a few protagonists attempt to escape the town. There are a few humorous moments, intentional and otherwise. The film is clearly a Romero flop. Of course, if you relate it to FEMA incompetency in recent disasters, it makes its own kind of sense. And, as in most Romero films, human incompetency is much scarier than an alien monster. If I hadn't lived in Evans City, PA, I probably would have rated ""Crazies"" as only 1 star, but seeing my former neighbors go insane, made me realize that Geroge Romero may have known, all along, what I had only suspected about the residents, leaving me with a tiny bit of self-satisfaction."
2,Terrible Waste of Time,"This low budget zombie-esque film is a complete waste of time, I rented it thinking that it would at least have some frightening moments but what I got instead was a test in patience. The details concern a toxic agent released by some dumb witted morons in the army in a small town and soon everyone gets the disease. The military, or what appears like extras in cheap army clothing, start to order martial law except a few hot headed guys break out. Each time the military is shown on the screen, Romero has some corny drum beating like we are too stupid to figure out that the army is there. Absolutely no suspense and an awful ending to boot...."
3,Over 30 Years Old,"Okay, this movie is over 30 years old and it really shows. Some of it is very silly and could have been done in much less time. The editing is poor, the special effects are not special nor really effects, and so on. The acting is better than most of the rest of the movie. It might have been okay during that timeframe, but pales for anything today. Still, it is watchable and we have an upcoming paintball scenario game based off of it. :)"
1,Just a bad movie.,"A little while ago I lost a bet with a friend of mine and I had to watch this movie.The plot is ,I thought, a good one. The water system get's contaminated by a virus that drives everyone in the town crazy. I seem's that the government has developed this as a wepon and it mistakenly was dumped. The army come's in and from there the movie is a mess. George Ramero of Night of the living dead fame is the director and it is his worst outing. There are too many slow motion shots that are not needed and distracting. The acting never get's above awful. This was a film that I wanted to see at first now I wish I never did...By the way this movie's plot is similar to a movie in the 80's called Impulse with Meg Tilly and Tim Matheson and it is a much better film. Go rent that......."
2,Long-winded...,"While this book is very interesting and well-sequenced, the chapters are too long-winded. As a graduate student, I have a lot of reading to do already. The author of this text (Manning) will go on and on for 4 pages just to make 1 simple point. This text needs severe editing to make the material more condense! It takes the enjoyment out of learning about fluency disorders(which is a very fascinating subject).If you're not a grad student, and have plenty of free time on your hands, then go ahead and purchase this book. Better yet, wait til the end of semester & I'm sure students will be looking to get rid of it. I would never keep this book as a reference tool. I only purchased it because it was required for the course."
3,Awkward Cut,"This product was cut very narrow through the hips. My husband is very slender and his normal 32 that is a little roomy was very tight. It also stated that the legs were cut to fit over boots, which is arguable. The ankles seemed almost tapered, they certainly were not wide enough to fit over his boots"
1,Teeny tiny,Much smaller than measurements would indicate. I ordered the same size that I order from Land's End and Levi -- ended up with something much smaller than expected in the waist and little short in the inseam.Wouldn't buy this online without trying on in a store. Sizing was definitely off other brands.
3,Looong,"I ordered a 34"" vice a 32"" because my previous 32"" pair makes me feel like a geek with high waters. Leaves a puddle of cloth at the shoe. But they are decent quality for the price. Levis are way over priced IMHO."
4,A great pair of jeans so far,"I actually love the color. It's bright without the usual pretentious fading or low-quality dyes. The fit is great and pockets are a nice size without looking bulgy. Like the other reviewers, the jeans are longer than the number says so the boot cut might be better if you want it to be an exact fit around your ankle."
4,Elegant and Economical,"A good pair of jeans which is an elegant fit as well as economical & not to forget good quality also. I am enjoying using it, thanks amazon.Sony DSC-W330 14.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Zoom with Digital Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.0 inch LCD (Black)Levi's Men's 550 Relaxed Fit Jean"
3,Preshrunk?,"I didn't know pre-shrunk jeans could shrink so much. I had to send a pair back because they shrunk unevenly. I can't prove it, but I believe these are seconds. The customer service was good though, & the denim feels good & tough. If you order these, I would recommend ordering a size larger than you normally take."
5,great!,"they fit and look great and the prices is even better, the shipment was on time.. recommend for sure :)"
4,A solid if unfashionable choice,"These jeans are totally devoid of any pretense to style or coolness and I like them for that. They have a very roomy, almost blobby cut. In my area, the male urban hipsters wear absurdly tight jeans, with their legs looking like tightly-wrapped carrots. Furthermore the cut of those jeans make the wearer appear to be wearing a diaper. These are not those jeans.The quality seems good and the fabric is soft but rugged. Time will tell if they hold up, but they seem like a good value for the money.Amazon pestered me twice to write this review, so I am guessing there is interest in this item..."
2,Wrong size,I ordered a34x32 and I got a 36x32.I was out of the country when the order was placed.I need the correct size
5,Hard to find,I have a hard time finding 42x34 pants for my husband for some reason they stop at 30 length in most stores he loves these and says they fit perfectly.
1,High-rise jeans not my style.,"These fit nicely in all areas except one. These are high-risers: Too high. I like at the waist or slightly below the waist as far as where the top of the jeans sit. These jeans just go too far up the abdominal area, and IMO, it's a very tacky and unattractive look."
4,the wife likes em! ;),"I got a thumbs up on these right away! They fit well and have a very nice deep blue color. Now that the holidays are over, I'm wishing that they came in a slightly relaxed size. (Who knew that your body stores fruitcake in your tush?)"
2,Fit,"The weight of the material was what I was looking for and the waistline was fine, but the fit around the lower abdomen and buttocks was way too tight.No, I am not fat but rather slim."
5,Jura Capresso S7 Avantgarde has been flawless 3yrs,"I'll keep this review simple... the S7 AG my wife and I got about 3 years ago has worked flawlessly. I clean it on a regular basis, which I have also heard is key not only for the sake of better tasting coffee, but also for the life and performance of the machine.We make shots almost every day and I guess we've made upwards of 2,000 drinks, and still it runs well. Prior to the Jura, I went through THREE Francis!Francis! machines (even the cool stainless version). In each case, the pump just didn't have the strength to push through proper espresso grounds (pods were OK), and I prefer fresh-ground flavor. Since the Jura has a self-contained, and yet full-automated system it was the only machine on the market at the time that made sense to me.Apart from the cost, it is a great machine that pulls a perfect shot every time. Until recently, it was the most expensive appliance we had in the kitchen...Enjoy"
4,Excellent Coffee,"This unit makes excellent coffee. If has preset buttons that let you make a great espresso or cappuccino right out of the box. It also gives you the ability to program it if you want to tweak the settings to even further perfect the coffee to your tastes.I had this unit for six years in an office environment where it saw heavy use. It paid for itself 10 times over, compared to going across the street to Starbucks.Be aware, that with heavy use the internal seals do eventually fail, and the unit has to be sent back for repair. The repair, combined with the large shipping cost should be figured into the cost of ownership.It worked well in an office break room, but might be a little on the large size for most home kitchens. (Although I frequently ponder buying another one for home use)"
1,Too much too little,"I expected a lot more from this machine. Now that I have it, I still use my old $5 drip coffee maker. The wife is still mad at me for spending our vacation money on it.Any impulsive male buyers out there: Steer clear, the wife would rather go to the carribean."
3,Not what I expected,Thought it would at least have some good card samples or tips on how to make great cards to gain that profit. Maybe i was expecting the wrong thing. But it doesn't have what I was looking for.
3,Not What the Doctor Ordered,"This is a great book but for very different reasons than what I ordered it for. It goes a long way in helping you with all the inevitable details that one has to think of when one starts a business - for this I give High Praise. What I thought I was ordering was a book that went into the details of making professional ""business type"" stamps, the ones that are self inking (or not) - this book is fantastic if your looking to turn a hobby into a business - for they go to great lengths to prepare you for that. It is not the book to teach you to do it in an ""industrial strength"" manner. I wish you all a great adventure into this - I can be fun! And very rewarding!Kevin."
2,Disappointing,"I was determined to like this book and gave it my best shot, but found I couln't bring myself to finish it. Yes, it's witty, but it's also hopelessly dated. The fifties had come and gone long before I was born, so I confess that many of the cultural references went right over my head. If you are looking for a spoof on academia, you're better off reading David Lodge or Kingsley Amis' Lucky Jim."
1,"Crapy Crapy Crapy Crapy music, i feel so sorry for these guys.","YOu must truly sux if u like hardcore! only loser listen to these music. Even metal is a lot better. What a stupid music world u people live in. There this album doesn't even deserve a one much less a 5. I don't know why you would listen to this kind of music, i just don't get it, it just sux.Chris, GCfans"
5,"Absolute Tops in Suspense, Characterizations & Story","Looking to hear an audio-book that will leave you dreaming of seeing the James Bond film based on it? Try this one. The audio book of The Night Manager takes my top audio-book award. The actor who presents the text has done other Le Carre books, but none as artfully as this one, in my opinion. Thinking of buying this audio-book? I would bet you'll be glad for every penny you spend on it: it's simply a fantastic story. I don't like to include story in my reviews, so I won't. Just to say, it is satisfying in every way. A structurally interesting novel, displayed in a fantastically exciting way. Once you've heard this marvelously delivered reading, try not to see Daniel Craig in the lead role - just try. British film and the Ian Fleming estate should not be far behind."
3,"Middle of the road, but readable","I do not get out much. So, the seemingly plausible descriptions of international arms dealers and their nasty trade I found to be somewhat novel and, therefore, fairly interesting.I even found use for Le Carre's revelations in a recent political argument with a leftist friend: ""The U.S. armed Saddam? Please! Anything we provided so many years ago has been obsolete for decades...and if you think, with all his billions in oil revenue, that Saddam couldn't get anything he wanted from illegal, international arms dealers, then, my friend, you are woefully naive!"" (Ah, yes, extrapolation and vicariousness are keys to a safe, happy life. But, I digress.) This is not the sort of thing, genre-wise that I ever read, but I found it compelling enough to finish. I did find myself rooting for the hero's escape at the end, and I was quite happy when he off'd those two [...] that had tortured him for so long. Shampoo, anyone? (Did I give too much away?)"
2,Are there two John Lecarre's?,"Are there two John LeCarre's? The LeCarre I recall wrote quite novels with quiet characters. The protagonist of ""The Night Manager"" is just short of being a superhero, and the villain Roper would not be out of place in a James Bond novel. I will grant that the prose is still very good and I enjoyed Sophie in her small time on stage (if you liked her brash character, you might want to read Amor Towles' ""Rules of Civility"")."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The main character here is a retired soldier, working the night shift at a hotel. He meets a woman who has information about an arms dealer.Because of this, he gets involved in a sting operation against the arms dealer, as he would like a bit of revenge after the woman is murdered because of the information she passed on.A slightly different book, with a commentary on how all governments mostly ignore the arms trade as they make craploads of cash out of it."
4,a good read,as usual le carre delivers when it comes to explaining the motives of the characters it was also cool tosee people from the russia house and the secret pilgrim in the bookThis book goes over a common le carre theme of peopel doing evil acts for good outcomes.
2,Bring back the Circus...,I was very disappointed with this book. The book started off with a bang and then sort of fell off into a rather lack luster ending. I long for the days of Smiley and the Circus
4,John le Carre on the upward swing,"Mr le Carre seems to blow hot and cold, one good book, one pot boiler. The Night Manager definitely falls into the former category. Jonathan Pine is the manager of a hotel in Switzerland, formal, correct, impeccable. But, like all le Carre's characters his placid exterior hides a multitude of depths. His mission is to bring down the ""worst man in the world."" Roper, the millionaire, gun runner, invulnerable friend of government ministers, philanthropist, doting father. Pine must infiltrate, seduce, outwit and destroy the empire that Roper has built. The tension is maintained perfectly and the everyday manner in which the characters go about their deadly business makes the book all the more riveting. If the final denouement is slightly disappointing, as if perhaps the author found himself in a cul de sac with no way out, overall, the story holds together wonderfully. And let's face it, at least he didn't finish with, ""And then Jonathan woke up."""
3,Worth a look,"An earlier reviewer pretty much summed up this book for me - ""...a middling good LeCarre read..."". Not exactly his best but still a pretty gripping novel and remarkably undated, even post 9/11. Some of his usual themes about loyalty and betrayal are here but at least this book takes place in an England which I can recognize, not in some post-Empire never-never-land. In short, if you like your thrillers written by someone with more than a passing familiarity with style and the English language in general, don't be afraid to pick this up."
1,SLOW,"not as gripping as his other books, well detailed and a nicely written story, but not as fast paced. i'd give it a miss."
1,Boring.,"I'm a big fan of spy fiction, and a friend recommended Le Carre. Sadly, this was one of a very few books I've left unfinished...and it was unfinished because I had zero desire to continue flipping the pages. The highly praised prose is just plain tedious to read, and the narrative is so slow to develop that I lost all interest. Now, I wasn't looking for action-at-every-page-turn, but some kind of exciting scene or development would have been nice to read, in the first half of the book. Plenty of other excellent books to read instead, don't waste your time with this one!"
1,This book [stinks},"Someone has to say it, it might as well be me. I really hated this book. I started in on jury duty and almost gave up on it then in favor of 6 month old Highlights magazines. He introduced about 35 characters to us in the first 20 pages, I wasn't sure for the first half of the book if there were in Switzerland or Egypt, (I think that they had been in both), but I swear he couldn't make up his mind. I didn't like the characters that I was supposed to like and I don't want to spoil the ending, but the story never resolves itself. I really hated this book. I loves me some spy fiction, but this book blew chunks. I know that LeCarre is the master of the genere, but he was asleep at the wheel on this one. Heed my warning or suffer the consequences on your own. Dog of a book, man."
2,Hurrah for the bad guys,"JLC's engaging use of language kept me reading The Night Manager long after I'd tired of plot and theme that crumbled to nothingness as the pages turned. As an older woman, I clung to Sophie and her vanilla smells and the power attributed to her over Jonathan. The story was interesting for the bad tradecraft and the previous century nonsense with bugs, taps, and intercepted communication, so necessary to the plot, and circumvented in real life. So much could have been done with the ""come to Jesus"" elements or the raw Canadian inset. How could Pine/Thomas have been given a New Zealand identity with no backfill? Women sprinkled the tale and were morally abandonded by JLC, except for Jeds who was plucked Deus ex Machina to breed horses. Loved the Pamanian interlude, though not as satisfying as in Tailor of Panama. Were it not for some overstated sexual situations, the book would be suitable for analysis by high schoolers for its view of morality in the late twentieth century."
3,Searching for the post Cold War devil,"LeCarre is undoubdtedly a spellbinder and a writer with true literary gifts. He ranks with top 20th. Century writers based on The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. With The Night Manager, however, he seems to be foundering in bestilled waters. There's no question LeCarre still has all of his tradecraft. He just has lesser evils these days. Like The Secret Pilgrm before it, LeCarre's post Cold War world here suffers from a severe lack of mystique. Roper is a well-crafted villain--LeCarre's doing the best he can--but it all feels like Mata Hari had dropped her last veil and revealed a rather common face."
3,Something is missing . . .,"I am bond to read everything that Le Carre writes because he has so often in the past created fiction that satisfied both because of the beauty of the language and the pleasure of the story. Here, alas, while the language still has that complex, deliberately affected style that seems so appropriate to Britans of a certain class, the story has little to offer. One doesn't care about the characters and therefore one doesn't care what happens to them. Not much at that."
2,disappointing,More Ludlum than LeCarre. LeCarre is a master writer; Ludlum churns out pap. This one reads like Ludlum and put me to sleep. Don't waste your time.
1,"finicky, but I can't find anything better","This print server is pretty bad but I can't find anything better for under $300. I just figured out that this one fails most often when I print something, turn the printer off, then later turn the printer back on to print something else. If I just leave the printer on all the time the print server won't make it print garbage the second time. For large print jobs I still have to connect the printer directly to my PC though (but be sure to plug it back in to the print server afterward or else your spouse will wonder why the printer doesn't work any more).HPS1U with HP Deskjet."
5,Greate for Home Netowrking,"My connection :- HP OFFICEJECT ---> PRINT SERVER -----> Wireless ROUTERInstallation was a Breeze , and believe me you will fell in love with the size . Its THE smallest and easiest to install .Even better than Netgear 1 port"
4,works ok for me,"The installation process of the print server on my Win2000 PC was straightforward. To add the printer using IPP was easy on Win2000, but Win98 took more time. I use it to share my HP laser jet. The speed seems to be all right with me, unlike other reviewers. Then again, I am only printing black/white text. It's cheap when compared to other print servers from netgear or hp."
1,worst product ever!,"stay away from Hawking Technology!! This thing doesn't work, and it hasn't worked for majority of people. Contacted tech support and wasted many hours. Didn't work for Minolta PagePro 1350WI've updated firmware, etc. configured it through the web. tried various ways of network setting, none of it worked. document just got stick in the print queue under xp and windows 7. tried rebooting the print server and printer. No avail.finally, go to their web site and it won't list print server compatibility."
1,"Yes, a POS","I tried installing this on 2 different systems (IBM laptop running WIN2K and a home built running WIN XP Pro, and 2 different printers. In all cases it: 1. did not work at all. And 2. caused my CPU usage to lock to 100% making the computer slow to a dead crawl. Even after attempting to uninstall the software, I had to resort to a system restore to make the computers usable again. Calling tech support was of no use. I wasted DAYS on this P.O.S. It made me feel good to crush that thing in a 4"" vise, crushing the little ******* into permanent garbage - which it was."
1,Save your Money- Buy another printer,"I bought this thinking that I would like to share my printer with my son on my network, rather than having to leave a pc turned on to drive a printer, or buying a second printer and that USB wasthe way to go. That was a mistake. The device works, setup is fairly strait forward and it does do what Hawking advertises I have to admit.What they don't tell you is that the device has about a 1k buffer and takes a very long time to acknowledge that buffer. So you print at about 1/20th of the speed you did before. That is with a HP 970Cxi printer. If you are printing graphics forget it.The Linksys is supposedly faster, but still a dog according to other reviews. So I'm now in a quandry about wheter I hook up an old pentium III pc and use it as a print server or I just buy another printer.As I said it does work but make you own judgement based on your needs."
2,"It does work, but very slow",I just got this and was curious if it would work since my printer manufacturer said they could not guarantee that it would. It does work but very slow as I just read on this site. I may return it. Like most people I was looking for a way to not have to keep a computer online to print but I don't know if this speed is worth it. Waiting multiple minutes for a photo is not work it. Printing text is fine however.
1,Simply Awful!,"I only wish I had read these reviews before I bought this turd of a product. For all the reasons the others mentioned, it fails on every level. Squirrely installation, S-L-O-W print jobs, runs super hot. Zero documentation, no web support, and no response from customer service. The uninstall utility doesn't even work. Stay away. Far away."
3,It's okay...,"Unless you a Cure (because of Smith) or Siouxsie & the Banshees (because of Severin) completist you probably would be better off spending the $20 or so on a copy of Siouxsie's ""Hyaena"" and The Cure's ""Head on the Door"" or ""The Top"" - they are all very similar (I think) to ""Blue Sunshine"" yet overwhelmingly better. Severin's unique bass approach in ""Like an Animal"" and ""Mr. Alphabet Says"" (easily the best two tracks on the disc) is worthwhile but there is little else that I was impressed with. I'm happy that Smith left this project in the dustbin otherwise we all might have missed out on some of The Cure's best work."
3,Mediocre with hints of genius,"This disc has plenty of potential with Robert Smith and Steve Severin let loose to indulge their musical fancies. But the result is for the most part mediocre, mainly due to the unappealing vocals of one ""Landry"", whom I guess was Severin's girl friend at the time. She certainly couldn't have gotten the gig any other way. Her wooden, sub-Siouxsie vocals ruin song after song. It's not all dark though-- Robert Smith sings on two tracks and there are several instrumentals. These are without a doubt the finest tracks on the disc, and among the most imaginative ever done by Smith or Severin. These hints of the greatness this disc could have reached make it worth buying. Just so long as the price is not too high."
5,"Call me biased, but...","I loved this album. I may be a huge Cure fan and developing a liking for the Banshees, but I'd still love it even if I wasn't.It's epic, refreshingly different, and sexually charged. It's full of vivid imagery and takes you on a strange, musical ride. The Glove uses a lot of experimental sound, both a brave and successful venture.I definitely reccommend this album."
4,This album will take you away,This side project of Robert Smith and Steve Severin was good. This album is so classic sounding in an 80's way. I'm quite sure it was partially drug induced(considering the state Robert was in around the time of these recordings. Very dreamy and strange songs...lots of female vocals but they arent bad...they just flow well with the melodicness that this album carries...not as good as The Cure of course but a good listen for fans of strange avant-garde 80's pop-rock with some keyboards. A trip to listen to.
5,The Glove Blue Sunshine (Import),"A MUST HAVE!!!! If you are any kind of Siouxsie and the Banshees/Cure fan, you must have this. ""Orgy"" is the most trancehallucigenic track EVER. ""Sex Eye Make-up"" is grrrrreat.As well ""Perfect Murder"", and ""Mr Alphabet Say's"".....Robert Smith tracks that are the most amazing ever.You deserve this CDAttomicc"
3,1 Outstanding song and 3 quite good,"The song ""Mouth to mouth"" is musically beautiful, and very original and intense. As I really put this song on my main list, I would say that it alone may justify buying the CD.The quest for originality can be found on the other tracks too, but I don't like them, except for :RelaxA blues in dragPerfect Murder"
3,"Yup, that's Robert Smith alright.","For Cure fans, Siouxsie fans, and just general bleak '80's music fans. ""Like an Animal"" screams to be the title song to a film about goth kids in the '80's. ""Mr. Alphabet"" is pure Cure B-side. The rest is not too bad, but not too good either. But isn't that what we loved about the '80's anyway?"
5,The Bible Makes Sense,Both an academic and accessible way to help people think about and use the Bible in a faithful way.
5,A Seminal Work,"I've had a worn out copy of this book for years and it has fallen apart to the point where I absolutely had to have another one. I don't care how old this book gets, it's a great way to learn the basics of statistics. I love this book and have since it came out in the 1960s."
4,Sweetly Intense,"Sweetly intense, but not intensely sweet, Bear City is a very honest, if sometimes distracted, look at the bear community, whatever that is. I've been a part of it for nearly 30 years and I am still not sure what it really is. Apparently neither were the producers of this movie and therein lies its charm. Bear City mercifully does not try to present a ""definitive"" view of bear life. The acting is superb, the ""extras"" and ""background"" guys are right on. However, it is a bit disjointed. It seems to dote on twinky queens almost as much as it does on bears, and that's why my review stopped at four stars. Character expansion could have occurred in the time allotted to the dress-up montage the two young guys mince through. Trying to fit in every nuance to please every viewer in 90 minutes, or even a Burns-length multi- part documentary, is just impossible. What they did with the resources at hand is pretty incredible, and I hope to see more with a better focus next time."
3,Better to Rent or Share,"The movie has good industry quality but the script was disappointing. I was hoping for a better representation of ""bear"" lifestyle and the over the board campiness of the film became bothersome.This is a film to share amongst friends or rent from the local video store. Not film library worthy!"
5,SUPERB!,"WOW!!!.......WHAT A SUPER FUNNY MOVIE!..........LOVE IT!MAKES ME PROUD TO BE IN THE BEAR COMMUNITY! :) GRRR, WOOF, WOOF, GRRRR!"
1,awful!!,"this movie was awful. i don't understand any of these positive reviews. the acting was dreadful and the characters unrealistic. i was annoyed by the steretypical asian roommate, the unbelieveable couple who argue because one of them wanted lap band surgery (really???), and the lack of chemistry between the lead and the so-called 'bear' he has the hots for."
2,mostly monochromatic,"The cover says it effectively: the bears are white and the men of color are twinks here. This film takes place in New York City, the home of hundreds of thousands of Black, Brown, and Yellow men. Nevertheless, MOST of the bears here are of one ancestry. I didn't say ALL; let me be clear. Still, this was terribly un-diverse. ""BearCity"" joins countless other low-budget gay films that support Eurocentricity and throw men of color to the sidelines. Even a doubly-oppressed population can be unjust or far from inclusive. I'm not surprised by the lack of diversity, but it rubs me the wrong way even still. I hope one day a work with bears of color would be filmed and distributed. That would be da bomb!"
1,can a gay movie get any worse?????,"I DON'T WRITE REVIEWS BUT I HAVE TO PROVIDE A WORD OF WARNING TO THOSE THAT ARE ATTATED TO THIS MOVIE CAUSE OF ACTINGBAD BAD ACTING MISSED CHARATER DEVELOPMENT AND WORSE WRINTING DID'T ALLOW ME TO ENJOY THIS FILMWHAT TERRIBLE ROLE MODELS GAY STEROTYPES SHUCKING AND JIVING FOR STRAIGHT PEOPLE AND WE ARE HUMAN BEING NOT ANIMALS TO CALL ""BEAR"" TO EVERYBODY IS OVER WEIGTH AND HAIRYI CAN SEE WHY ITS DIRECT TO DVDI USAULLY LIKE ALL MOVIES BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS MOVIE SUCKED YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON SERIOUSLY DONT WASTE UR MONEYI ONLY I COULD GIVE IT LESS THAN 1 STARI LIKE MORE BEARCUB (CACHORRO) THAT IS A GREAT MOVIE"
4,Great and funny,Great production value and characters for an independent film. Only bad thing I have to say is the music is too loud in some spots and you can't hear the dialogue well.
2,Another mediocre gay comedy...,"I honestly wish I could say that ""Bear City"" is not your typical indie gay comedy--and indeed some elements of the film differentiate it from most of the other gay indie comedies that seem to sprout up like toadstools these days. But those very elements that distinguish this film--the focus on bear culture, the bashful twink who ""comes out"" as a bear-lover, and the depiction of love and sex among gay men who do not resemble Abercrombie & Fitch models--are so thoroughly transformed into standardized gay tropes that the movie is ultimately stripped of its originality and settles into a formulaic, plot-less pattern of mildly amusing vignettes with no real focus or story structure. We are ultimately left with vapid platitudes assuring us that bears don't need to conform to queer norms of beauty in order to find love and happiness. And it takes them only 90 minutes to deliver this profound and provocative message (YAWN)."
2,Could be better.,For starters you can tell that the director was inexperienced because the quality of film wasn't very good and it looked like a high school student directed it...The story had a little romance to it but not enough to get you excited.Just like anything else the whole bear scene is just a label of who someone is. If it was directed much better and had better story I would've given it a better rating maybe.
5,Fun loving movie.,Interesting mix of people in this mmovie. You have the muscle bears right through the chub's. Every time I watch this movie I get something new from it.I do recomend it.
4,Mini Captain's Desk Organizer,"This is a really cute little miniature captain's desk with compartments for pens,paper,envelopes,ink,paperclips,etc. Also there are two drawers with dividers. I use it for my calligraphy supplies and parchments.The only drawback is that the drawers are unlined, but I lined them with some nice velvet to protect my pens and nib holders. All in all, I love it."
4,"Not real B&D, but a great mind control book","This book is a great look at the troubles that come from a big lie. We have voyerism, exhibitionism (not very strong), lesbianism, and some light B&D all mixed together here. On top of that listening to the thought processes of the heroine is fascinating. This is a very hot book."
3,Definitely sex and more sex!,"Enslaved is an okay read. It's not brilliant or even imaginative in its approach. There is tons of sex - almost every page. The main character, whose name escapes me at the moment, is apparently sexually inhibited, but once she has convinced herself that she is under ""hypnosis"" anything goes. Some of the stuff that goes on in the book, while trying to be titillating, falls flat because it is just so unbelieveable. However, it is a fun read and it was interesting to see how one lie spun into a series of exploitation and manipulation from supposed friends and loved ones."
3,Graphic Sex with Storyline,"Pretty innovative story-line and there's enough graphic descriptions of sexual acts to satisfy all. If it's too much for the uninitiated, the storyline makes it possible to read the book and put it down for another day :) The happiest people will be those readers who are into S&M, and slightly repressed readers who want to ""get out"" *grin* It's a pretty light-hearted book, perfect especially if you want a little brainless reading."
2,ehhhh ...,"i agree that the book was all sex, but it seemed over the top -- and not in a very good way. by the end of the book i was thinking 'my god, what else?'. i ended up skipping pages just to find out what happens and was disappointed with that!wont buy him again...."
5,los acostas,Thia music is very romantic in which you listen to and you feel or remember many things you've been through.
5,Breathtaking,"I ordered this book for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas after she had asked Santa for a book of fairy tales. I am blown away by the artistry of the book, and it also has such a great variety of all the classics, I couldn't be happier with this purchase,"
5,Beautiful book!,I was looking for a book that had a cross section of children's fairy tales and poems and this one is absolutely perfect. Plus the illustrations are beautiful!
2,Not my choice for a young child,"This is a beautiful, but dark book. While the illustrations are lovely, many of them are very dark and somewhat scary. Not appropriate for a young child or bedtime reading. We bought this for my 3 year old who loves many of the stories in the book and she was frightened by so many of them that we stopped reading from it."
3,Not for young children,I agree with another reviewer. Classic stories but some are very violent and dark. Definitely not for younger children.
2,Not for the moraly minded,"This is a beautiful book and I have only read to Repunzal, but that is when it fell apart for us. In the end of the story the blinded prince is able, by some miracle, to find his beloved Repunzal whom he was to marry. But when he finds her she is not alone. No, two small children are with her. It is THEIR twins! It may not bother many to read this to their children, but I don't want my child believing it is okay to have premarital flings."
5,Fantastic,This treasury of literature is somewhat different from other versions of classic tales but I love how detailed each story is. My young son really enjoys listening to them & looking at the beautiful illustrations.
1,Works only with batteries,The product is good but I wish it worked also with a power cord. I have outlets outside and I could use them so I do not have to replace the batteries every month.
1,Didn't work after first rain.,"The product seemed like a good thing ...Until the first rain storm. I'm returning it today. I dont think it is good for outdoor use,unless it is sheltered from wind and rain."
3,does it float?,"In researching this product, there is very little information available. For example, does it float? Can the Playmobil motor be fixed to it?"
4,Yo owe it to yourself,"While surfing the web trying to find a new rock band worthy of my attention, and hard earned bucks, I found a Mustasch album and the CD cover caught my attention, and since I have always believed in the power of a good album cover I took the chance and bought the album in cuestion, Ratsafari.Well, I was right! This album packs quite a punch and rocks like if there's no tomorrow. Some songs brought to my memory the riffs of Black Sabbath but their sound was quite particular (Alpha Male), while others rock hard all the way (Monday Warrior and Black City) and some others are melodic doom ridden fests (6:36).An extraordinary band with a sound so personal yet familiar that every rocker should give it a spin, imagine Black Sabbath riffs mixed with Soundgarden grunge sounds, I can't explain it you have to hear it."
4,Three blade pack,"Each of these blades is good enough to make those cheep chinese saws run like the high dollar ones. The thin blade cuts fast and clean in wood, plywood and non-ferris metal. After a year or two of use they still cut like new. This is money well spent."
3,WORTH THE READ,"I really like Judy Christenberry. Her books are always sweet, fun reads ( just what I expect in a series romance). I felt the hero in this book started out acting like a JERK! It seemed like in every scene he was yelling at her and demanding to ""talk to her now""! I stuck with it and luckily the hero started turning around and redeemed himself by about half way through. My co-worker borrowed and read my copy and felt that he was a man in love that had trouble expressing himself in the beginning. Well maybe. Either way this book is worth a read just because I LOVE this author. You really can't go wrong with her."
5,It's A MOD MOD MOD MOD WORLD ETC...,"Normally I'm a real smart-alecy buster when it comes to these reviews, but let me tell you that this stuff is up there with the best of The Small Faces and is much better than early Who, (and I love early Who!) I know Phil Collins says that The Action are one of his favorite bands. Don't let that stop you from checking them out, he sounds NOTHING like them. Shadows and Reflections is a marvel, but it's the Since I Lost My Baby that is the show stopper. The best Brit. aranbee slowjam cover. Must be heard to be believed. Ace, as I hear they used to say."
2,Jetlan cable won't work with Vista,"Unfortunately, I discovered that this cable won't work with a computer running Windows Vista. This isn't the fault of the cable manufacturer - they say so in their user's manual - but Amazon should make this clear on their sales page - they don't mention any such limitation."
5,Worked great with PC Mover,"I had recently purchased PC Mover and File Mover, and then found out by surprize that the cable included was USB 1.0, which was incredibly slow, and that they wanted an insane amount for a usb 2.0 cable. This was much cheaper, and worked as fast as I would have expected as the 'official' cable. I didn't even have to install the included software because the PC/File Mover software couldn't distinguish the difference.So I had a very good experience with this cable."
3,Fair Warning!,Fair Warning:Most people will want another (Vista compatible) cable:Cables To Go 39977 USB 2.0 Vista Compatible Data Transfer Cable
1,Unreliable -- not worth it,"I've been using USB transfer cables every day for years to keep my desktop and laptop synchronized. This is the first time I've used one with JetLan (PCLinq2) software and the experience has been horrible. I can't transfer more than one small file at a time without the software locking up. I've been trying for an hour now and anything bigger than about 20 MB just won't go across (smaller files do fine). This is under WinXP SP2. Also, the software defaults to the C:\ root drive and doesn't seem to have a way to override the default starting directory for transfers. Do yourself a favor and find a cable with better software."
1,Don't bother,I was interested in transferring files and settings between two XP machines. The product didn't work period - and I was told it would in my case. Customer support was pathetic and they clearly didn't care. Their response to my issue was to try to sell me another product.
3,NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE!,"Product probably works well with XP (have not tried), but it will not work at all with Vista - and I wish this were made clear in the description. Must return."
1,Jetlan USB 2.0 data transfer cable,"The one star rating is because this transfer cable will not transfer with Windows Vista. Apparently Microsoft had a proprietary program designed as well as the transfer cable itself, so you have to purchase one specifically for Windows Vista. Other than that the product itself is a good quality cable, it just wouldn't do what I needed"
1,not pleased,"It was not mentioned before hand that this item does not work with windows vista, i guess that is why it is so much less expensive. It is useless to me now since all my PCs are on vista. Thank you so much for the lack of infomation.signed NOT PLEASED"
2,Not very fast - Does not like Vista,"Used this product between two XP machines. Tested it against 100Mps network for transferring files/backup. The 100Mps network was about the same. I was hoping to be faster since USB is 480Mps.Also, tried to use between an XP machine and Vista, no go!"
2,Annoying,"It does what it says but, it takes too long to prepare both machines. Install the software on both PC's and use their way to tranfer your files!"
3,Lost half my money which I returned in like-new condition.,I paid $18 + for the product which I returned. My account was only credited with $10 +
4,Why isn't there more of this music?,"This is wonderfully dense, danceable electronic music, with a stylishly bored female singer. You feel as though she has seen it all on tour, but doesn't mind singing to you about it. And it's all so European.I searched in vain for comparisons to other bands. It fits roughly with some of the current electroclash bands like LCD Soundsystem or Fischerspooner. The singer sounds somewhat like Siouxsie Sioux. The Fitness is another comparison I could make, although they're a rather obscure Seattle band.It's nice and long, so you get your money's worth. It gets boring after a while if you expect too much out of the lyrics. The most fun song is ""Superfast Service"". Otherwise, just put it on and set the mood."
3,meh,"the book is okay. it is informative, but had it not been required for class, I would not have purchased it at all."
3,what i wanted but too costly,"The product is perfect for the scars after surgery but the shipping was outragous, it cost more than the product, way more"
5,"Love ""Never Love You Enough""","This was my first experience with Chely's music. A friend has a co-write (For the Long Run) on this CD, so I knew I'd buy it. After seeing Chely's showcase on GAC, I knew I would like the entire CD. Great vocals, great songs - Jezebel, Horoscope, For the Long Run, While I was Waiting, Deep Down Low and One Night in Las Vegas are my personal favorites, but there's not a bad cut on the LP."
2,Okay,"This album was okay...but the singing sounds kind of harsh, which makes it difficult to listen to."
3,So-So For Chely,"I have this album and the only tracks worth listening to are ""never love you enough"",""jezabel"", and ""what if we fly""buy used if you cannot Ms. Wrights best work but not the worst.Buy the album ""Let Me In"" for her best"
5,Star has Risen,"I don't know if she'd still be called a rising star or not, but in my mind Chely Wright has risen. The title of her new CD, ""Never Love You Enough"" pretty much defines how I feel about it. Each song is better than the last and worth re-hearing countless times. I bought it because of the representative music video from the album, but I love the whole thing. I'm now on the wright side!"
2,hmmmmmmm,"Comparing this band to Van Halen and Metallica takes a lot of balls. This band reminds me of Jet, The Hives and other bands I can't stand. I have never seen them live and I'm sure they put on an energetic show. As for people in Sweden, I think they would agree that Evergrey is the best live band. This sounds like AC/DC light."
3,"Expensive, but useful","Considering what you get, this kit is expensive. Still, I don't know where I could get the same sort of thing elsewhere. I think the price of DW7050 is probably about right if DW7051 and DW7050 were sold together as one single kit. I won't go so far as to tell you not to buy this, because it's useful. Just be aware that if your do, your paying a premium to DeWalt!One thing to note. Pay close attention to how you put it together. The way you do so depends on whether or not you are putting it on the right or on the left side of your saw."
3,"Good, but at a price","Definitely a major time-saver - without this (and it's requisite partner, the DW7050), the process of duplicating cuts would be much more time-consuming. Not the best design (it's a lot of guesstimations if you're cutting a longer piece than the base of the saw - causing you to have to measure with one hand, support the stop with one hand, and tighten it up with your other hand). If this had some sort of fine-adjustment mechanism to get past the need for three hands in such cases it would be perfect (and then actually worth the cost of having to buy both the DW7050 and the DW7051)"
2,Beware of Sharp Edges and Corners!,"The stop functions as expected.However, the main bracket is sanded on six sides and the sharp edges and corners were not are not deburred afterwards. After cutting my hand on one of the burrs, I filed the edges and corners and my gripe is that I have removed the rust protective plating in those areas allowing a path for rust.This would be a much better product if in DeWalt's manufacturing process, they would deburr the edges and corners."
4,timothythetoolman,Dewalt length stop works very well. I had cut our a couple picture frames using a clamped on piece of wood. When I tried to put it together I found that some of the lenghts were not the same. The DeWalt Lenght stop fixed the problem. I would buy it again.
1,CHOP SAW LENGTH STOP FAILURE,This item would not conform to the fence corner and base where the mitred wood rests while cutting (at the designated length) prohibiting you from cutting an accurate length from simply moving the wood along the line to the stop. I had to redrill and locate the length stop's end-flat/ plate so it would fit for shorter mitre cuts that remained in the bed. A precise cut mitre angle crept past the stop along the fence and base without modification. REAL LOUSEY DESIGN THEORY. YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY THIS TO FIT THE SAW'S BED/ FENCE INTERSECT IF YOU BUY IT.
4,Useful Charts,"I like the way this is organized. I am a very organized person. I am keeping a journal for the baby but in that one I son't want to add all the things that make me miserable but in the organizer I feel like I am being scientific rather than a whiner.The best feature of the organizer is the symptoms chart, it shows which thing is normal for which month. I am at week 11 and exhausted and seeing that in the second trimester the fatigue and nausea goes away gives me hope."
5,"Great organizer, keepsake and reference for subsequent pregnancies!","I used this organizer with my first pregnancy and it was wonderful--it had everything I needed in one compact place. After my son was born, I found that I loved looking back on my weekly journal pages and remembering milestones and significant happenings during his pregnancy. We are pregnant again and are using the first organizer to remind us when we can expect to hear the heartbeat, do our ultrasound, etc. I have ordered a second organizer for this pregnancy and am enjoying it very much--especially knowing how it will help me relive details in the years to come. Pregnancy is such a wonderful time and, yet, details really do get hazy! Love her pregnancy and baby books and love this organizer."
2,Skip this book - buy your own planner instead!,"I brought this thinking this would be more of a guide or a read-made checklist of items needed or things to keep in mind by a weekly basis. Instead, most of the pages are blank with minor guidance. I agree it's a great way to motivate yourself to keep track of things, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. A spiral bound planner would be the same thing. Skip this planner, you aren't missing out on anything."
5,The best organizer ever!!!,"I absolutely loved this organizer. I bought it when I was about 7 weeks pregnant with my first daughter. I carry around a daytimer with me everywhere and this was like the baby version of my planner. I carried it with me everywhere; it fit in my purse and was a great place to take notes at the doctor's office.I loved it so much that I have bought six more, every time a friend of mine announces their pregnancy (for a first child) I go on Amazon and have one sent to them. Everyone has loved it!It was also fun to read through the journal portion after my daughter was born and reminisce what I went through :-)."
3,Too scrapbook-y for me,"This book has a good start with its sectioning and checklists, but it is laid out in too much of a scrapbook fashion for me. I didn't want an organizer to serve as a memory book, and this one does that (mixed in with a few checklists). I was looking for a project/to-do/questionnaire/tracking mechanism, and although this lend itself to that; it is just written in too much of a scrapbook fashion for me."
3,Not what I expected.,"This was a present from my mom. It was nice, but not what I expected.. Too cold, like a calendar, while I expected something more warm, to express my feeling on my pregnancy.. I used for a couple of weeks, and then bought a lovely diary to keep my thoughts there. This book just felt to clinical.Hope this is useful, have a great day!"
3,Not really needed,"I am a first time mother and I bought the organizer thinking I would fill it up. In my opinion, It is a waste of money. Being pregnant, you already can't remember much, and this is just another thing to forget to do. But if you like to keep track of every little thing that happens, feel free to get this book."
2,very bad!,"well! i would not recommend this product, it sounds really bad. i had to buy another, better brand of course."
4,The Godmother,"I am an avid science fiction reader and was looking for something new. Elizabeth Scarborough had co-written several books with Anne McCaffrey, which I had enjoyed, I was looking for some other books that she had written when I found The Godmother. The book is a very interesting blend of SF, current urban political realities, magic and an updated version of the Grimm's fairy tales with a liberal dash of humor.Scarborough does an excellent job of developing real life characters. This book is both light hearted and thought provoking. I can't wait to get started on The Godmother's Apprentice."
3,Good book but jumped from character to character too much,The concept is good and original and I enjoyed the way it was treated. What I didn't like was the constant leaving a character in jeoperdy or about to make a discovery and jumping to another character. Since I read the book over several weeks; by the time all of the characters had all been updated I sometimes I had to go back and reread the first ones cliff hnger in order to understand what was going now happening.
2,A Disappointment,"This book was a real let-down for me. I had just finished reading Lisa Croll di Dio's ""Sherwood Forest"" and was looking for some more magickal escapism. This book was just lame. Sorry."
1,Too basic.,"This book claims to be a review for the cardiology board exam. It is not even remotely adequate for that purpose. It might be slightly useful for general internal medicine board review, but is probably too basic even for that.Here's a couple of questions/answers from the book. These are direct quotes, from pages 106 and 107 of the second edition:Q: What is the screening test of choice for carotid stenosis?A: Duplex scanning.Q: What does normal ventilation with decreased perfusion suggest?A: PE.Of course, some questions are more complex than these. But a substantial percentage of the book appears to be written on this level. I plan to take advantage of Amazon's refund policy."
1,Not a Beneficial Review or Informative,"I reviewed the book with an open mind as I thought it would have to be somewhat beneficial. Unfortunately, the book was a disappointment as the information it contained was elementary and often not even pertinent. The only impressive or useful characteristic of the book was the title, which the book did not live up to. The book contains a hodgepodge of basic and often irrelevant information a layperson could google over the internet."
1,Poor buy,This game is lots of fun but I was VERY shocked that it did not come with all the pieces and many duplicates of the properties. We are missing one Washington property card. We also have numerous duplicates of some properties.
1,Terrible Game - don't waste your money!!!,"This game was so cheaply made that the paper money will probably tear after 1 play. In fact, the game board came with a noticeable tear on it.But the horrible durability is the least of this game's defects. It has so many mistakes in the rules, cards, and on the board, that it is literally unplayable. Properties on the board do not have corresponding cards, properties are misnamed, money values are messed up... I could go on and on about the errors throughout this game. My teen received this as a Christmas gift, and got so frustrated with the errors in the game that we stopped playing and decided to return it. Worst part - we couldn't return it because we opened the box.Don't waste your money on this useless, terrible game."
5,Greatest party board game EVER!,"This board game was the smartest buy for a board game I've ever done, besides RISK. Not only is it great for 2 players, it is great for parties. It's very easy to pick up, same as Monopoly rules. The board looks very nice and there are many ways to play. Great game!"
1,WORST BOARD GAME EVER!,"This is the worst board game I've ever played (and having played over 200 board games, I should know). While the game had a huge amount of potential, due to poor planning and thought put into it by the game designers, it comes off as being a hack. Cards have incorrect descriptions on them, mathmatics of the game are horribly inaccurate (purchase price for properties, rents paid out, and cost of improvements have no intelligent basis. pull out a regular monoploy board and compare.). If you must choose between buying this game and buying $35 worth of toilet paper and burning it, go with the latter. I wish I had."
5,airport and trucking properties,What have others found?Is it true that the rules for rent on airport facilities are dependent on **number of TRUCKING facilities*** owned? rather than number of airlines owned? This seems quite odd as the other mode of transportation is NOT dependent on the number of trucking facilities owned.Comments from the makers?
4,"DEWALT DW7080 Extension System, for DW703, DW706, and DW708","I have the DW716 double bevel miter saw. Like other reviews state, this extension system doesn't slide under the saw for easy storage so keep that in mind when ordering it. You can either leave it extended all the time or remove it from the saw's base if it gets in your way.I anticipated this so the system is everything I was expecting. The system itself is great, very pleased with it. I like it a lot better than the black 1 piece version that comes on some lower model dewalt miter saws."
3,Sturdy but not that easy to adjust,"I have used these for a few years. They are sturdy and do not deflect all that much even with abusive projects like fencing.The big negatives are:1. Hard to adjust due to choice of screws on the base that hold them in place. For some reason, these screws are not knobs or thumb screws. Instead, they are big screws that require a tool to turn. Why? This is the sort of thing that begs for a knob or at least a thumbscrew.2. This works in conjunction with a length stop attachment. Because thee is clumsiness in setting up this units' support extension, there are issues that are caused on the length stop, too. It all works OK, but it is slower, stickier and more frustrating than it could have been.In any case, if you need/want something like this for the DW, this is your choice and at least it won't break."
1,Doesn't stow underneath base for storage as advertised,"I purchased the extension kit for my newly purchased DW716. I've been borrowing my father in law's DW705 and he has the extension kit for that model which is great - it stows neatly under the base of the saw. Not so with the DW7080 extension kit and the DW716 (both are advertised as being compatible). I couldn't believe that it doesn't slide under the base more than a few inches. This is practically useless since I don't always want 20"" sticking out the side of the saw. Others noted the same issue with their model saws. If it stowed it would be perfect, but it doesn't and I'm dissapointed. Also, the screws are self tapping which explains some issues other people described in their reviews. I didn't have any issues, just a little annoying but not a big deal since the instructions explained this."
2,not really impressed,It is just OK but certainly not worth the price. Should have got two for the price and I think Dewalt should increase the price of their saw and include them with the saw.I would not recommend anyone spend the money on these.
5,Great addition to my saw,"This product was a fine addition to my Dewalt compound miter saw. It allowed me to securely place eight foot lengths of crown molding on the cutting table. Amazon shipped mine without the end retaining bolt, but I was in too much of a rush with my project to raise concerns. Besides, not having that bolt did not affect the product's performance. Once again, this was a great addition to my saw.Update:This product sucks! It worked well with flimsy MDF crown molding, but is an absolute waste of time with any real wood. No amount of adjustment will make it support my hardwood projects square against the fence. Save your money and build your own fence and table extension."
1,DeWalt missed the boat here,"Looks and feels great, out of the box.....but, when installing on my DW713 the nightmare began. Mounting is very sloppy, and impossible to level with the saw base. Although listed as compatible, it just doesn't work. DW7080 and DW713 = JUNK. Trying to return, but mail order return are costly...my costly mistake...don't do the same. I suggest you find another support system or saw..Added Comment....I found a second hole on my saw base. It wasn't indicated in the instructions, but looked like it could help the situation. This hole needed a special size hex head screw, but did the trick. I now have my extension mounted solidly, and functional. I still won't change my rating or previous comments, because DeWalt failed in its' instruction and their support help."
2,These are fine but the saw is lame when using them,"I bought two of these but Dewalt designed them and the saw poorly.Holes on both sides of the saw are in the exact same place so when you put in both, they can only be pushed in half way, so they stick out.They also fit sloppy, not something I would expect from Dewalt.What they should have done is offset the holes so they could be pushed in for storage. Other saws do this, its not hard.Other than that, they work fine."
3,spike,Would love to rate it but....says ships in 1 to 2 weeks. LOOKS MORE LIKE 2 MONTHS. Will buy it elswhere if i can find it.
1,DW7080 does not telescope in and out of DW718!,"The rods of the DW7080 Extention will only go into the bottom of the DW718 saw base several inches before they hit against metal. The extension does not ""telescope"" in and out as Dewalt describes. Storing the saw will take up more space unless you take the extention off.The holes that the screws to secure the support rods in are not threaded from the factory. I used a large flat head screw driver to push down really hard while the screws created initial thread.You need to be careful that you do not strip the thread when screwing them in the first time.Probably need to take care when securing the extention later as the base of the DW718 seems to be some kind of cast metal.I tried to change rating to three stars but could not."
3,Horns is nice,the horn itself is great. The finish is good and the bulb works well but the mount seems like it could be better.
1,Junk,"Granted, it is very cheap, but the quality is so low it is not even worth the $3 they charge. The bracket is flimsy and the bulb falls off. Junk junk junk."
1,Extremely Cheap Quality!!!,The horn was delivered bent (bought from BikeWorldUSA) on the Flare and the Chrome was flaking along the length of the horn. The hardware to connect the horn to the bike is very very low quality and does not allow you to lock in the direction of the horn securely. Just pay the extra $5-10 at your local bike shop for a higher quality one. I am.
5,Tracks:,"""Chattanooga Choo-Choo"", ""Coloured Aristocracy"", ""Cheek To Cheek"", ""Ain't She Sweet"", ""Guitar Boogie Shuffle"", ""Sweet Georgia Brown"", ""Frog Legs Rag"", ""As Time Goes By"", ""Great Western TV Medley"", ""Haste To The Wedding"", ""Stars And Stripes Forever"" plus another extended medly."
4,"Dreamy and beautiful, highly recommended","I bought this album 10+ years ago when I first saw them in Portland, OR. I have no idea what's become of them since, but I still enjoy their music. The first and last tracks are especially gorgeous. ""Best Song"" is aptly titled, and ""Streetlamps in Snowfall"" is like a sinister dream creeping up on you as you're first falling asleep.If you enjoy bands like Beach House, Mazzy Star, and My Bloody Valentine, you'll probably like this."
4,Exactly as represented.,"Not too often am I able to purchase a book by mail that is exactly as the description described. If you are looking for a detailed analysis of religious stained glass in color, symbol and style,,,this is the book. Quite informative and seems to be thorough in its description and origin of symbols and colors. A must book for those individuals doing stained glass for churches. An excellent reference for those contemplating stained glass for their church. Enjoyable reading along with the very beautiful pictures of existing windows and stained glass in some of the present day churches."
5,Excellent.,"A fascinating inside look at President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during the Korean War and the constitutional crisis that followed. Westin pieces together bits and pieces of key legal briefs, Truman's memoirs, and an account of the social and political forces operating at the time of the seizure. If you ever wanted to know what the key actors were really thinking and what happened after the Supreme Court declared Truman's action unconstitutional, this book is a must read."
5,"Fascinating, Captivating","Really a very interesting read. Picked this up shortly after Ford died and it was really interesting to see his final thoughts on this most controversial period in American history. The ultimate truth may never be known, but with Ford being the last member of the Warren Commission, this beautiful volume will stand as the last comment on the subject from that committee. Proud to have it in my collection."
1,Safety review by the lady who closed Columbus airport?,"I have a hard time accepting the testimony of a woman who would ""prove"" bad safety measures by passing a bag full of putty, wires, and electronics through airport security, then not boarding the plane, then sitting back and hysterically saying ""I'm sorry"" while thousands of passengers are inconvenienced for 4 hours."
3,New story,"The following news story provides a clue about the one-sided nature of this author's views: COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Authorities were investigating an unaccompanied piece of luggage at the Port Columbus International Airport that led to the shutdown of a runway for four hours.WCMH-TV reported Saturday that Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the Department of Transportation, checked a bag Friday as part of a story the station was doing on airport security, but didn't board the flight to Washington.The station showed the contents of her bag, which included what appeared to be a tape recorder, an alarm clock and wiring. Ms. Schiavo had put identification on the bag, the station reported."
2,Paper never refused ink.,"Ms. Schiavo's shrill tone and cheap scare tactics start on the cover and continue through the final page. My mother once told me that 'paper never refused ink,' and this tome is a fine demonstration of that phenomenon. The author's shameless effort to frighen naieve travelers about the safety of our air transportation system is exceeded only by her book tour rhetoric. Although not depicted in the book, I enjoyed seeing her with a smoke-hood over her face on the Oprah Show"
3,Good Entertainment but questionable facts,"Yes, there are some good points Ms. Schiavo raises. She does not provide evidence that older aircraft are less safe but it's something to think about...even in 1998 it is hard to avoid a 727,She certainly knocks Delta...a shabby smelly plane and says she has gotten letters regarding Delta. From whom? About what? My last flights on Delta were fine, the planes were immaculate, the flights were on time and were uneventful. What's her hangup with Delta.She discusses the belief that flying is safer than driving. All you have to do is walk around Downtown Seattle and see how people drive. It is obvious that flying is safer than driving.We can look at a time factor as she proposes or look at it this way. Say 10,000 people were driving from Seattle to Washington DC and 10,000 people were flying from Seattle to Washington DC which would have the higher percentage of those arriving in Washington DC alive?"
1,Nope,"I read this book when it first came out. I actually spent money on it which I am mad about now. I didn't even finish it. I got about two-thirds through before I couldn't stand it anymore. She had so many things in that book that were totally false I couldn't believe it. I've been in the airline industry since '88 and had to laugh at this book. And NO I'm not bashing the book because it bashes the airlines and FAA. The FAA needs bashing I think. They have big problems. Airlines are in no way problem-free either, by any means.The problem I had with this book was that many ""facts"" she had were completely false. I don't know how someone could, in good conscience, especially someone who is supposedly an authority on aviation safety, write and publish a book on airline safety with as many falsities which can be found in this book.That's all. Except that when I see her on TV I have to change the station."
4,What do you think now???,"I read this book when it first came out. The author received much criticism about her "" biased "" opinions. In the wake of the terroist hijackings due to lax security, it is safe to say that the FAA is clueless. Of couse people will say that the airlines are responsible for airline security but the FAA regulates the airlines right? How about the child who flew for 26 hours straight on several different planes before being discovered? How do these things happen. Now the airlines are in deep financial trouble due to their incompetence and are crying for the government to bail them out. Mary was right on."
1,HAS HIDDEN VENDETTA FOR THE FAA,IDENTIFIES PROBLEMS(HER OPINION) NO SOLUTIONS---HIGHLY CRITICAL OF EVERYONE---ONLY SHE IS RIGHT--IF SHE REALLY FELT AS STRONG AS SHE CLAIMS--WHY DID SHE CUT AND RUN--THIS BOOK-- COUPLED WITH THE ATTITUDE THAT SHE PROJECTS ON TV INTERVIEWS--REFLECTS THAT OF A WHINNING PERSON WHO COULDNT HAVE HER WAY--AND DECIDED TO MAKE A LOT OF NOIS
3,"Charles D. Richardson, author, pilot, Air Traffic Controller (Ret.)","Mary Schiavo gives anyone involved with aviation an insider's view of how the FAA, ""the tombstone agency"", really functions. Since the beginning of aircraft regulation, congress created a double-headed agency mandated to ensure safety and at the same time foster growth in the industry. Almost always these two, safety vs money, collide, creating a problem for the public safety. If you fly either as a passenger or pilot, read this book.Charles D. Richardson, author of a military thriller, The Pact and coming soon, Flying Machines."
1,"How to market yourself as an expert, by Mary Schiavo","This book is worthless. I don't want to say to much about it, or Mary will have suceeded in further promotion of her disreputable aviation expertise.Suffice to say, Mary has become expert in everything, except the aviation industry."
5,Excellent reading!,"I read this in two days! Interesting reading and fascinating finding out that the FAA isn't really concerned about you-only about you buying a ticket. The first 28 pages were about the ValueJet fiasco and I couldn't put it down. The facts are there and she proves a lot of her points. I can't help but think if it was written by a man, it would have received a lot more press."
1,Deocorum Please,"Jacqueline Rose has done some serious scholarship in literary criticism, but this work is dubious, at best. I'm not sure why she misses the mark so poorly in this extended essay on the link between children's fiction and the publishing industry. But the work is very un-focused and rather trite. The approach is a bit dated, and I can imagine that perhaps the book is more an extended discourse on the theoretical apparatus that she seems to be enamored with rather than a solid interpretation of Peter Pan. The book is really an odd one, and it left me feeling so disgusted that I did not wish to finish the tome. Although, the other reviewers are a bit too vituperative in their critique, this book really strikes me as somewhat immature."
5,Earrings,I needed something basic in silver and these fit the bill exactly. They are exactly what I was looking for.
5,Very good clamp,"This is a very good clamp and I personnaly don't think the price is all that bad, and you should use one just to be safe. With that said, well, I get lazy and don't use mine as often as I should."
1,DeWalt DW7053 Dust Bag,I purchased this bag for my DW708 miter saw and it barely captures any of the sawdust. Most of the sawdust shoots directly out the lower portion of the blade and will not make it up to the higher location of the bag. I subsequently hooked up a vacuum system with much better results.
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased this product and was not impressed with the performace. I have a Dewalt mitersaw and found this dust bag only gets in the way and does not stop much sawdust at all from being blown out the rear. I would not recommended it.
2,Good for show,I use the saw with out a bag. I use a piece of 90 abs to direct the sawdust into a rubbish bin or just pile it up where it lands and clean up at the end of the day.
3,Pretty good in function,I have this bag on my DW708 and I have found it works best inverted with a slight tilt . A wider catch inlet would be an improvement .
1,Less than worthless,"I use a DW 12"" saw. This needs zero stars. This bag falls off when the blade arm is raised. After a half day of chopping it had pehaps 1/3 cup of sawdust with the rest on the floor. Sent back as defective. Don't waste your money unless you want to duct tape it on for looks. The other reviews about this problem were dead on."
2,Good In A Pinch,"This was what came with my DeWalt miter saw, and I lost in a move to our house. It is too small and but unless you have a dust collection system this will do in a pinch."
1,Bad advice,"When I called the Black and Decker Service Center for a replacement dust bag for my chop saw, the lady said that this is the one I would need. The first time I put it on the plastic ring split open. So much for Black and Decker and Dewalt (they must own B & D ) expert help!"
3,DeWalt Miter saw collection bag,The Dewalt miter saw collection bag is pretty flimsy for the money. Won't hold up an the collection area is very limited. Not that great of a product
2,So So,"The bad is fine but the saw doesn't throw much up into it, so if you are looking for a miracle cure-this isn't it."
3,decent,I lost my original dust bag for my miter saw and had to purchase another one. It performs just like the original. It collects a decent amount of saw dust but expect your work space to be covered in saw dust that isn't caught by the bag. It is easy to empty with the zipper at the back of the bag and it seems to open wider than other dust collection bags on other tools to make emptying it easier.
4,As Advertised,"This is the simple man's coffee maker - a good cup (or two) timeafter time. Very little maintenance, carafe broken once but nobig deal replacing it. Love this little machine."
5,All my Raffi favorites,"When I was a little kid I had a bunch of Raffi records & that was pretty much all I would listen to. When my nephew was born I started searching for some music we could listen to together. I stumbled upon this cd & bought it just for fun & realized that I still like Raffi after 20 years! Now my nephew will not play in his ""Johnny Jump Up"" unless we put this cd in & he just goes crazy when the songs ""Anansi"", ""Bananaphone"" or ""Y A Un Rat- Sur Le Pont D'Avingon"" come on. I'm so glad, he's only 9 months old and is already a music lover! Thank you Raffi, for inspiring 2 generations of music lovers in my family!"
2,the B list comp,"The compilation ""This CD is Condemned"" has most of the choicest cuts from the Deviants' long history. This collection is a motley grab-bag of stuff, and the best cuts here are nowhere near as good as anything on ""Condemned"". Don't go for this one unless you already have ""Condemned"" and just have to have more."
5,More beautiful than I expected!,"I always wanted a snowflake pendant and asked for this for Christmas. It is much better quality for the money than I expected. The snowflake is larger than I thought it would be, which is a good thing! The chain is attractive, though it seems shorter than I expected- but it works. Everyone actually thought the CZs were real diamonds! It is beautiful and unique."
2,Cheap price because of the poor quality.,If Charles Barkley ever had to deal with this printer he would say it's turrbull. Every time (and I do mean EVERY FREAKING TIME) I use this thing it wants to print the allignment page. It says there's a paper jam about 90% of the times I try to print (of course there isn't one) and I have to restart it multiple times to get it to work. It goes through ink like Mexican water goes through your stomach. The print quality is fair once it finally does print. I would say on a scale of 1-10 the print qulaity is about a 6 and the annoyance factor is roughly as high as America's national debt. I've averaged that out and generously given it 2 stars.
4,an awesome first effort,"The Blood Brothers are a band that will never fully be understood by the nay-sayers but that doesn't matter to fans of this genre. The energy and chaos of this album is addicting, an adrenaline rush underestimated by those that refuse to hear anything but cacaphony. The only thing more thrilling than a Blood Brother's album is a Blood Brothers show.This is a stellar first effort and a fine introduction to them for a first time listener PROVIDED that that the listener already be experienced in the grindcore, scream rock genre. If not, you're bound to be confused.Sonically, the later releases, especially Burn Piano Island Burn, are more polished but that doens't mean anyone should pass up this awesome specimen.As addictive as any drug, the Blood Brothers hook you and reel you in."
3,grows on you,"To be honest, I can't even type what I first thought when I heard this record. A cleaned up version would be: ""This is unpleasant. What in the world is this stuff?"" I did not enjoy the way these guys screamed and how they sounded. Very strange. I am also not a big fan of punk. As much as I disliked it, I wanted to hear it again. With subsequent listens I have grown to like this. It is different. Different is good. I suggest that you borrow a copy or find a way to test it out before you buy it, especially considering it is only 21 minutes of music. And listen to it at least a few times before you reach a decision."
1,stopped working after 8 months and hardly any use!,"This was a great disappointment. It sat on my dining room table so was hardly subject to rough use, i hardly ever used the CD player (mostly just the radio), but the CD player broke after only 8 months, showing an ""Err"" every time i tried to play a CD. This is a poor product. Because it was past the 3 months return period, i couldn't return it. So I have wasted my money and have to go and buy another CD/radio player."
5,Instructor/ Construction and Remodeling,"A good video that lays out all the steps in order, and gives you a good foundation for laying wood flooring. This would be useful for someone with good basic carpentry skills who wants to tackle a floor. Not necessarily for a neophyte. The video is well filmed and layed out, and the instruction is pretty clear."
4,Danish candy,"Three high-school boys inhabit an idyllic Danish suburb of single-family homes, empty summer houses just begging to be broken into, tiny clean stores staffed by pretty fresh-faced girls, and dewy soccer fields; they waft from one location to another on bikes, backed by a quirky little soundtrack. Ostensibly about three friends Jakob, Bo, and Mikkel on the soccer team, the movie spends the most time on the fits-and-starts romantic and sexual relationship of Jakob and classmate Mathilde. Meanwhile, Bo drifts away to an older, wealthier crowd, and Mikkel takes his chances with Mathilde when she's on the outs with Jakob. And then there's the consequences of the summer house break-in. The movie is gently humorous overall, but has some disruptive dark moments. In the end, an attractive cast and locations, and a peek at European life, make this a pleasant movie."
5,Can't believe this one didn't win the Grammy,"I have to wonder if the Grammy voters actually have kids, or if they merely vote for Name Brand as reflex. What a shame, when there's so much more creativity around than strictly Sesame Street. This album is a case in point. Not only is it stylish, catchy, well-performed and well-written musically, it is also uniquely educational. We were fortunate enough to have been able to attend some live performances by this talented group, but I know many families who haven't and whose kids still adore this album. The theme is dinosaurs, of course, but there's a sensitively-handled subtext about handling fears and nightmares. I can't recommend this one too highly, we're giving it as gifts all the time, along with Cathy Fink and Marcy Marxer's ""Changing Channels"" (which was also nominated for a Grammy and lost out to Sesame Street)."
4,"very catchy, well-made tunes","As other reviewers have said, these DinoRock productions are great for kids. Each one has several songs that I love to sing along with, and I often sing or hum the catchiest parts off and on during the day.But I must offer an opinion differing from all the other reviews I have read -- the narration is kind of annoying. And I feel bad expressing this opinion, because I really do like these works, but I would like them so-o-o much better if they had hired professional actors to do the spoken parts. I'm sorry, the tunes are great, but the spoken lines fall flat! Very amateur sounding. I'm pretty sure that even I could do a better job reading the lines. So, if you are easily annoyed by that type of production flaw, be fore-warned. But of course, the kids don't mind, and most assuredly don't even notice."
3,Buy Exile on Coldharbour Lane First,"Exile on Coldharbour Lane, A3's previous album, is amazing . This album is a weak follow-up. If I didn't know any better, I would think that this was their first album. It doesn't have the soul of the previous album. It doesn't have the loose, risky feel that make you feel like you should get up and dance, sing, and shout. What you are left with is a mildly please rock album.If you don't want to take my word for it, read the reviews for this album and then Exile. People may like this album, but they love Exile.Exile on Coldharbour is one of the the most enjoyable blues, rock, techno fusion albums I have heard and should be in your collection. I can only pray that A3 will bring back its great eclectic sound with the next album."
4,3 to be exact.,"I loved Exile on Coldharbour Lane, and this too is a good album. In comparison to Coldharbour, La Peste is their come down album. I'm sure half of their friends OD'd and who knows what else since the release of Coldharbour. The reason I say that is because La Peste seems to have been written in a very dark place, and I don't mean an attic. Although this album is probably a product of a more mature A3, I don't know if that is necessarily a good thing. I happened to like the less serious and no excuse approach of their previous album.If you do not have Exile on Coldharbour Lane, get it. If you do have it, and are considering picking this one up, you will have to adjust, but I believe that overall that this is a worthwhile addition."
3,$1199.00 retail?...where did you come up with that?....,This item is available brand new at HD for $599. Where did you come up with $1199.?
3,who goofed??????,"I had hoped to get this wonderful saw at the $279 ($251 after 10% coupon) price at which it was offered today. No tax. Free shipping. Too good to be true...and it was. Sadly, after ordering, I got the ""we made a mistake in the price"" e-mail. Oh well, I still like Amazon. But shouldn't they give it to those that ordered it at the listed price??"
4,"Powerful and smooth, but dusty","I bought the DW 708 3 months ago and have used it extensively since then primarily building oak furniture. Prior to the Dewalt I had a Ryobi 10"" non-sliding miter saw that labored when sawing through 6/4 white oak. The Dewalt cuts through it like a hot knife through butter, yielding a smooth cut with minimal tear out. The sliding mechanism is smooth and the miter presets seem very accurate. The only criticism I have of the saw is the dust collection port on the saw is small and relatively ineffective. With a powerful dust collection system attached I imagine I manage to collect about 25 - 30% of the sawdust generated - not particularly good performance. I have overcome part of the problem by placing a floor sweep collector on the workbench behind the saw. This has increased my total collection to about 75%. Never the less, the positives of this saw far outweigh the negatives and I highly recommend it."
3,Not the best for finishing work,"I dont own this saw but have used it a great deal. for cutting very wide stock and rough framing members its great, but try cutting molding or making funiture with it. The huge 12"" blade jumps too much. I own a great number of tools and every single one of them is a DeWALT. They are the most reliable tools out. But im definetly not a fan of this saw. I own my Dewalt 12"" fixed single bevel compound miter saw and its the best ive ever used. One other thing about the slide saw is that its belt drive as is all the double bevel saws. I do not like this. Ive had the belt lossen and slip on me and even break. If you are looking for a good quality, reliable miter saw, go with the DeWALT 12"" Single Bevel Compound Miter saw. Its powerful, tought, and it has a worm drive meaning no belts. But over all the slide sawis not too bad of a saw but just not for finishing work."
5,It doesn't get any better,"This saw beats the competition hands down. Every single petty gripe I've had with Hitachi saws is resolved by DeWalt with the 708.There are various complaints about adjusting this saw to steep bevels but if you read the manual it is clear how to deal with these adjustments.It could be argued that this is a very dusty saw but that has to be expected. The 12 inch blade has a thick kerf- - it WILL clearly create a lot of dust- -BUTAs a professional woodworker I've got to say that in my experience with this type of saw, it doesn't get any better."
1,"DeWalt DW708 12"" Double-Bevel Sliding Review",I couldn't get the saw to cut square. If I got a 45 degree on the right to cut it would be off on the left. I couldn't fine tune it because it would fall into the postive stops and not allow me to adjust a quarter degree one way or another. There were some good things but I had to take it back because after several hours of adjusting it didn't suit me. Due to DeWalt's excellent return policy it was no problem to take it back after 3 weeks.
2,Cutting Base moulding laying flat @ 45*,"Cutting Base moulding laying flat @ 45* does not cut square no matter how much i try to adjust it, it doesnt work. as for the rest of the saw its ok. I will buy the Festool Kapex next time"
3,Watch your thumb,"I love Dewalt tools but I feel there is one minor design flaw with this saw. I have to be very careful that when I grab the handle with my right hand to make a cut that I place my right thumb under the handle and not to the side. Several times, I have my thumb to the left side of the handle and it gets cut by the blade guard coming up as the saw goes down. The handle is just too close to the blade guard."
2,DW707 is not for the professional,"I am not a contractor, but a homeowner who is building my own house. The DW708 is an excellent tool when it is new; however, over a short period of time, with inconsistent use, the slides get loose and does not cut an accurate angle. You must keep the locking screw snug which is not the way it is supposed to operate in that it is then difficult to slide without this screw being loose. It also has no dust protection in the table bearings and eventually becomes difficult to move the table from one angle to another. Again, I do not use the saw everyday so I am confident that anyone who depends on this tool daily to give them accurate angles would be disappointed after a short time."
4,nothing better except the DW718,"I've had my DW708 for almost 3 years now and I am very happy with it. I love the capacity, ease of use, tool quality, the 12 inch sliding range is great for wide stock, and the locking stops are just where you need them.The tool isn't perfect though. I don't like the location of the alignment marker for the double bevel. It is obstructed for shallow angles up to roughly +/- 15 degrees. There also are not any postive stops for the bevel. Lastly I have yet to find a laser system compatible with the DW708.My complaints with the postive stops for the bevel, alignment marker location, and laser system have been addressed on the newer DW718 but it will cost you another $150-200.For my purposes the tool has mostly been great. It has run with no issues and will continue to serve me well for years."
2,Blade out of alignment with the Slides,"I have used other Dewalt saws and they where very good this one I have the blade is out of alignment with the slides. So in other words it dog tracks. It is a manufacturing defect and there is no way to adjust it. It is just defective. Others may have had good ones but this one is bad. The back of the blade drags on the right side of the cut. In a 3/4""x 4"" thick board as much as 1/32"". The front of the blade will produce a pretty good cut on the left side because the blade angled that way with the back of the blade to the right when you pull it through with the slides from back to front. Very annoying and makes for a lot of extra work."
2,A let-down for the money,"As a renovation carpenter I have used this saw for rough & finish work over the past year and have to say that this saw is NOT WORTH THE PRICE! Is does cut smoothly, and true, the dual compound feature is convenient, but I expect that in a saw at this price point. What is absoultely most FRUSTRATING about this saw is the quick lock lever on the table. DON'T EVEN TRY to cut anything less than a 2 degree angle - this table simply will NOT LOCK in place! This saw is ADEQUATE, for its price it should be excellent. I'd recommend either the Makita 10"" or the Hitachi 8"" if you really need a saw for precision work."
1,Dissapointed,"I thought I was purchasing a saw for my shop but instead found out I should have purchased this for framing houses and not for the fine finish work I do in my shop. The deflecton of the blade and wobble off the saw head will cost you a lot of money if you get into more pricey fine wood. The saw has held up nicely but not what I expected for the money. I have since purchased the new Hitachi 12"" and the difference is incredible. I really thought the Hitachi would be similar to the Dewalt since they both are 12"" models, but I wanted to try it out anyway. I used to own the 8 1/2"" Hitachi and and still have it in my shop 12 years later. The new Hitachi 12"" looks like something out of a space movie but boy it is accurate."
1,JUNK,"This saw might work ok for hacking 2x4s for rough framing, but is useles in a furniture/cabinet shop. Here is why:1. Does not stay square no matter how often you set it up.2. Way under powered for hard woods (even 4/4) with a fine tooth blade.3. The dust shute is a joke, even when hooked up to a collector.4. The saws head has about a 1/4"" of play(no wonder why it won't cut square miters)5. Requires the hold-downs6. Did I say it doesn't cut accurate miters?This saw has caused me more frustration then any tool I have owned in my 20+ years of building furniture."
4,DW708 D-B SLIDING COMPOUND MITER SAW,"The only two ""faults"" I have found are as follows:The dust collection fails miserably in capturing dust. The bag collects only a small portion of the dust produced. A waste of $... if you ask me. Even when hooked up to a vacuum, it collects very little dust. Plus, another annoying feature is the yellow band of paint around the outer circumference of the saw blade, which leaves a yellow stain on oak boards. Everything else about the saw is great."
2,Not worth the money,"This saw was quite a disappointment. It is just not accurate, and worst of all, the bevel adjustment moves no matter how tight you try to get it. It seems that the bevel angle gets altered after every cut because it won't stay tight. How professional is that? I didn't pay this much for a tool that requires this much work. I will definately stick with the teal tools from now on."
4,RBetri,A great eye opener on education. All those that are convinced that compulsory education is a solution open your mind and read this book.
4,Many twists and turns!!!,"This suspensful and well writrten novel by Diane Hoh won't let you put the book down. With an intersting plot and suspicious characters will leave you hanging untill the end. When Tess she a shadow walking away from the Devil's Elbow roller coaster immeditly after it goes off coure, she suspects somebody was tampering with the track. Nobody believes her whens she tells her friends what she saw. But somebody knows it's true, and that person will do anything to make sure Tess doesn't spoil their plans. Soon, Tess is tormented with slashed tires and menacing notes and phone calls. Who is out to get her?"
2,Not her best....,"I've really enjoyed reading many of her other books for YA's, and I often reccommend them to kids I work with. However, I would never reccommend this one. The story is so far fetched, but it might have been more believable if it was written from a single point of view, instead of the constant jumping from killer to victim. I also thought the killer's reactions to the main girl in this story was harsh and far fetched. Sure, he was nuts, but I still didn't buy his actions. This was the worst of the books that I've read of hers, unless you are a die-hard fan, stay away from this one. It's not only a waste of money but also of your time."
4,What a twist!!,"Oh my gosh, this book is a must read!! I never ever guessed the baddy in the book. The person was the least expected. Diane Hoh keeps you in suspense in this book all the way through. I could hardly put the book down. I was literally glued to the book. :)=good"
3,Creepy storyline,"This book was very well written and had a lot of suspense and kept me guessing. I'd never really liked amusement parks anyway, but after reading this book, I don't want to ever go on one in my life. This is the first Diane Hoh book I've read, (although some say she goes under the alias of Lindsay Caldwell), and it was very good. I'll have to get another out of the library."
4,Pretty good,"The ending of this book really got me. I never guessed who the guilty person was, and usually I know through the whole book."
1,What a disappointment,"Hey, Pure Shores is ok for a theme tune (some nice harmonies) and Black Coffee surely has some slick (especially their hip swivelling dance routine) but this is a terrible album. I am afraid I had to switch it off before it finished, it is so dull! I had thought that Shaznay was a good songwriter and that the band had taken a more hard bitten, street wise direction but all the tracks seem to merge together into irritating background muzak.Don't buy this unless you are so in love with them that you do not care. Even the inside photo shots just seem to miss the point!I am going to give my copy away!"
5,funky pop,"All Saints distance themselves even more from the spice girls with their latest release. This Cd is awesome! On each and every track the girls sing to the max, give us attitude and sass, and the production is seemless and amazing. ""Saints & Sinners"" is an amazing blend of electro-pop/r&b/funk. From the sexy attitude filled ""all hooked up"" to the sweet and gentle ""i feel you"" and the electro-pop ""black coffee"", this album is a must for any music lover. It's pop with that extra twist. Way to go girls! (Oh and the 2 bunus tracks are awesome as well)"
5,A great cd,a great cd this cd has a lot of catchy pop songs and i just love it!! Its better than their first cd
2,Jackie Chan as a Villain!,"""The Killer Meteors"" provides further evidence that producer/director/hack Lo Wei had no clue as to Jackie's real potential. Lo Wei built several ""Bruce-Lee-alikes"" around Chan in the early '70s. Despite the fact that the ""chop-socky"" had ran its course, Lo Wei blamed the lackluster commercial performance of these movies on Chan. One result of this problem was ""The Killer Meteors,"" an early Chan film, featuring him as the villain! Chan delivers a spectacular performance, as always. Unfortunately, he only appears in the last third of the movie. Also, Chan as a villain becomes somewhat difficult to swallow, considering his lovable, down-to-earth personality depicted in the vast majority of his films. Overall, one of Lo Wei's better films, but it suffers from too little Chan."
1,Poor Jackie,"In this movie, Jackie playes a villan who is being poisoned by his wife. He doesn't have a large role, and magically reforms to fight the last fight scene; after being melted! The final fight is worth seeing, as Jackie and Jimmy Wang Yu fight over a pit of stakes.The acting is a bit stale, and the end was too sweet for even me, but it definately wasn't the worst jackie movies."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I paid $1.49 to rent this, and I want my money back! Jackie Chan is definitely NOT the star of this movie. He has a small role as the villain, and he's really not a very interesting bad guy (however, the death scene where he sort of melts like the wicked witch of the west is kind of cool). But if you're a big Jimmy Wang Yu fan, go for it!!"
2,killer meteors a time killer,"Okay hear is the deal, this movie was not a Jackie Chan movie, he was barely in it and when he was he sucked, the action overall was really poor unless Jackie was fighting and even then it was not that spectacular. even bareing in mind that this was never intended to be a jakie chan type movie and is more of a supernatural powers, Chinese folklore movie I still thought it was kind of a waste of time and money, and i got it for under ten dollars, if you want to see it once, well it's your time."
5,The Ne Plus Ultra Of Shave Creams,"Another entry in a long line of outstanding Italian shaving creams. Rich, smooth, full lather. Great product in every way with first class packaging."
1,Way too small...,"My four-year-old daughter received the Bride outfit for Christmas, and put it on right away. She wears a size six. The dress fit - barely, but was too short and so tight that it was uncomfortable for her. However, it fits her four-year-old friend fine. Don't buy this unless your daughter wears a size four or under."
3,A Subpar Remake,"This television remake of a minor 1947 John Wayne western classic not only suffers from the fact that star Lou Diamond Phillips is not the ""Duke,"" but also from a script and direction that is definitely subpar.Phillips is a good actor, as is his co-star, Deborah Kara Unger, but attempting to step into boots previously worn by a movie icon like Wayne is always a mistake.The basic story about a wounded gunman who is taken in and reformed by a Quaker family is also viable, but writer Jack Nasser and director Terry Ingram, who shot their picture during a Canadian winter, do not seem to understand the western genre. The dialogue is staid, the pace and action sequences are static and the movie is, frankly, dull.The DVD contains a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette.Michael B. Druxman"
3,"Serious work, but boring...","Sometimes his writing is rather dutiful, maybe because he tried to inform historical facts about Japan for those who do not know very much about Japan. At least, this is a very serious work. But, almost surprisingly, there is not much new insights in this book. If you would like to know much more about Japan, it might be better to read novels by Kenzaburo Oe, Haruki Murakami, Yukio Mishima, or Soseki Natsume."
2,Not insightful,"I simply could not finish and did not feel like reading through this book anymore in the middle of it, because I found it boring (although his attitude seems to be quite serious), not because I am Japanese and feel irritated by this book. I cannot help feeling some deja-vu while I was forcefully reading this book. ""The lexus and the olive tree"" is more interesting in terms of discours about Japan."
5,start with this,"Patrick Smith's work is becoming known in Japan as the interpretation of Japan that only the Japanese don't know about. That in itself says a lot about this book. There may indeed be some flaws, but the basic thrust is powerful and timely. It is impossible now for foreigners in Japan to get away quite so comfortably with cultural relativist banalities. The propaganda, and the historical background has been exposed, and Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again. This book has made a real contribution to providing the basis of a realistic understanding of Japan among ordinary people. It's a good place to start for anybody interested in Japan -- which is only starting to get interesting (as long as you like rollercoasters!) It fully deserves five stars, although some people will, of course, mark it down."
5,Best ever box set,"This is a must for all tops fans and truely is magnificant, it brings out the best from these four familiar guys, wonderfully put together and deserves every tops fan, s attention if you want to levi and the guys giving there best this does just that , what an exellent compilation."
1,"Wheres ""Do Whatcha Gotta Do""","This is a very comprehensive review of Four Tops ""cuts' what I simply can't understand is why none of these 'Hit Lists' do not include what I believe to be one their greatest, Jimmy Webbs, Do Whatcha Gotta Do! Other than this terrific song I love the rest of the Boxed set immenesly"
4,Black & White,Are you familiar with the dark room but you want to know more? This book will help you tremendously. When I first read this book I learned so many new techniques that I never knew. This book you will never stop learning from.
3,"Expensive, but it works","I must agree with the above reviewer in that this item costs too much. Still, I don't know where I could get the same sort of thing elsewhere. It is a ""must have"" item if you also want to use the DW7051 Length Stop, as it attaches to this unit. The price is probably about right if DW7051 and DW7050 were sold together as one kit. I won't go so far as to tell you not to buy this, because it's useful. Just be aware that if your do, your paying a premium to DeWalt!One thing to note. The nuts are metric. I have metric sockets, but not wrenches. To tighten the nuts into place, you need to put a wrench on the rods themselves, which again, are cut metric. I made due with a ""normal"" (my point of view) wrench, but it didn't grip the part firmly."
4,Above Average AND a Safety Accessory,"Expensive? Yeah. but NOT as costly as cutting off a thumb or a kicked back 2 X 4. This is designed to support whatever you're cutting, so you can SAFELY keep material under control. It is well made (albeit in Taiwan) with heavy- duty parts - rods, plates and hardware. Mine came with STANDARD 1/2"" SAE nuts. Try using adjustable wrenches to install the rods to the plate and the screws underneath. Also if you leave just a little looseness in the installation hardware under your saw, you can easily slide the extension in and out to accomodate your lumber. You may want to lightly lubricate the rods. If I had a complaint, it would be that this should come WITH your DeWalt miter saw instead of as an extra."
3,Must Have,"The item is expensive but necessary. The kit comes with a regular nut that attaches the bar clamp to the saw. If you substitute a wing nut, you can quickly tighten or loosen the wing nut in order to slide the unit under the saw. It is NOT METRIC! DeWalt would do well to develop a retracting system and include it when you buy the saw."
2,Pretty Sure It's Not Worth It,"I love DeWalt tools and generally think they are worth the price, however - this is going a little overboard. I believe (as many others do) that this should have come with the DW705. It is overpriced and actually doesn't work that well. I've installed it correctly (with a little help from Customer Service) and yet it still doesn't sit properly. I think I'll go back to my own rigged contraption - it worked better than this does! I expect better from DeWalt."
2,Not a pair.,"The description is misleading. It states that you get a pair, when actually they only send one."
1,Dewalt DW7050 Extension review,This extension kit is an absolute piece of junk. This is mostly in part due to the poor mounting design. Save your money!
1,deff leppard sounding,"This a great cd and sounds just like deff leppard.John pratt has a great voice ,and thomas and giles do a great job on guitar.The songs are pretty rocking on money ,take me back ,lydia,and where you gonna run.Even the ballads arent bad,and the back ground vocalls sound just like them.So if you like deff leppard buy this cd"
3,Simple and for begineers,"To begin with, as a person familiar with the works of Toshie Takahama and admire it, there is nothing ""complete"" about the book.There are a lot of colourful models within and this book is definitely not among her best.The models represents what used to be typically Japanese origami style, simple to fold, effective enough to be recognised. Of course not to mention, packaged in a colourful and attractive manner.Would be a good book for beginners and a present for a kid."
5,great 9.2 coverage and fantastic DbCool software,"this book is pretty much the only Oracle book I've seen that covers 9.2 features in depth. Ingram's DbCool GUI software from author's website is a great companion to the book, but not mandatory. I use it daily alongside TOAD but DbCool is free (!?). DbCool explain plain shows the incredibly useful filter and access predicates new in 9.2 plan.Buried away on the website for the book (see back page of book)is loads of free stuff which some Oracle consultants charge for, audit, healthcheck, jpeg space charts and nice doc on Change Manager and native compiling for PL/SQL and Java. Hats off to the author for all the free stuff and long may it continue. Book worth every penny."
4,Sock Hop and All that!,"This cd is hoppin' and swingin' and taking you on at trip back to the 50's. With classic hits like Johnny B. Goode, Tequilla, and the Stroll. This Cd will get you jumpin and ""Rockin around the clock"". Put this cd In at a party and you'll get ""Whole lotta shakin goin on""."
1,I did not enjoy this book,"I read it after reading his En Route book.I love the former, but found this one boring.I didn't learn anything from it."
5,Brilliant,"There are few books that touch me as much as this one did. Night and Dawn were both extremely powerful, but The Accident truly was the apex of Wiesel's wonderful trilogy."
4,Bury the Dead,"This was a difficult book to enjoy most of the way through. We understand that this is a Holocaust survivor who has seen everyone he loved die or disappear. We want to reach out and understand him. However, he is so caught up in his past that he is constantly tearing his present to shreads. Frankly, we begin to lose empathy and/or sympathy with him until he is finally confronted with the cause and solution of his inner turmoil. Actually, we know the cause but it becomes clearer as to why that cause is so rooted within him. The solution is brilliant and worth the whole book for the understanding it brings to the reader. ""The Accident"" that happens is merely a vehicle in which the resolutions are enabled to happen. This book is an important addition to Holocaust Literature and is an essential reading for those truly interested in the subject. Don't despair with the book until you've finished it."
2,"Not worth reading, Wiesel is hopeless","In ""The Accident"" Wiesel attempts to prove that life is pointless because of the Holocaust, and that he's ""dead."" I personally can't help but agree with him, that he is psychically dead--but I couldn't stand this book because Wiesel refuses to look beneath the surface and face the painful potential of rebirth. (And I'm not talking about religious rebirth, rather, healing from ancient trauma.) Instead of considering a solution for his psychic deadness, Wiesel just gets further lost, and uses his writing to obfuscate the point.In reality, I think Wiesel strongly wants to LIVE (which is why he expends so much energy writing), but is too terrified of the vulnerability inherent in just coming out and admitting it.So my overall assessment of this book: It's not a worthwhile read, because Wiesel is an unresolved, traumatized person (primarily traumatized by his family of origin, secondarily by the Nazis) who remains in a bitter, largely hopeless state."
3,More of a 3.5 really,"This Book was a poor follow up to Night. After reading Night I was blown away on how the book appeared to be flawless and inspiring. The Accident however was Elie Wiesel, in a nutshell, mourning constantly about his past. Love and Despair. Life or Death. Some of the things he does in this book makes me despise him. I hope he has found what he wants out of life or death, but please Wiesel do not write another horror story..."
3,cute set,I got this as a gift for someone and it was a very cute set and they enjoyed it as well. I personally think its cuter on line then in person but for the price it was a good find.
2,Pretty but...,Don't plan on wearing this under anything that is even remotely clingy...it shows everything! The size is pretty true but not a lot of give so don't think that you can order a size smaller and squeeze in!
1,Aweful,"Hank Williams is the King of Country. This CD is garbage. Exactly how can you have a Hank Williams tribute with Ryan Adams? Johnny Cash is the only one on this CD that really deserves to be. No one wants to hear Keith Richards butcher one of the greatest all time songs ""You Win Again.""How can you have a Hank Williams tribute without Hank Williams Jr? He is the only person who can honestly do justice to Hank's songs. They could have at least had some better modern singers. Try country singers. Toby Keith, George Straight, etc. Not Keb' Mo. Not Ryan Adams.Stay clear. It is garbage."
4,A Tribute Worth It's Salt,"We are not usually fans of tribute CDs. Rarely do the tributes match the original versions and the quality of performances is usually spotty, at best. This one, however, is a keeper with more outstanding performances than one can usually bargain for. First off, Hank Williams is an artist truly worthy of tribute-- a uniquely innovative singer and writer and one of the great influences of modern country music (not to mention rockabilly and all its offshoots). Although the voices here hail from widely divergent realms of popular music, they are all (with the possible and understandable exception of Hank Williams III) distinctively singular artists in their own right who have each found a way to convey the essence of these terrific songs without compromising or diminishing them."
5,"Hank Williams ""Timeless"" on limited edition clear vinyl",This is an amazing cd with great artists doing a great job with Hank's songs. But this is a 10th Anniversary Limited Edition clear vinyl album from Lost Highway Records!!!!! This is a must have for any collector. You gotta add this to your collection and make all your friends jealous!!!
2,Buy the real Hank Williams instead,"While some of the cuts onthis hold up (notably by Dylan, Lucinda Williams and Knopfler/Harris) there are some stunningly listless and lackluster performances. Beck and Richards should hang their heads in embarrasment! One wonders, if they didn't love the music or have any enthusiasm for it why would they record such God awful versions of these immortal national treasures at all?"
1,All Sizzle No Steak,"Unlike many ""die hard"" C&W fans reviewing this album who do not like this becasue they want contemporary dorks singing Hank's calssics or they never heard of artists like Beck; I hate this cd for other reasons. The main one is becasue it blows. A legend being covered by a star-studded lineup would make you doubt this review but it's true. I love Petty, Beck, Dylan and others on here and I also love great county music. Sadly, none of this matters here as the songs are lifeless, awkward, and depressing. It is a $3 cd at best with no songs worthy of any quality jukebox nor has any redeeming value for completists who want the rare b-side. If you must, download Emmylou's ""Alone and Forsaken"" as it is the best song of the bunch (and that aint sayin much)"
2,"Apart from Dylan and Cash, not much of a tribute","How hard it must be to cover Hank. Well, it shouldn't be. Dylan is good. Cash is classic. Some others are ok. Not very impressed, though, with the package as a whole."
3,Timeless:Hank Williams Tribute,"Being a real Hank Williams fan I really looked forward to this album. The first cut on the album by Bob Dylan is a disapointment.His rendition of ""I Can't Get You Off Of My Mind"" sounds like an insulting parady of a country song. The next ten cuts rate good to great. Emmylou Harris singing ""Alone and Forsaken"" is really wonderful.The real shocker is the last cut, Johnny Cash doing ""I Dreamed about Mama Last Night"". I like Johnny Cash but what is this number doing on this album? It is not a song, but a talk piece and it has absolutly nothing to do with Hank Williams."
2,Where's the Energy?,"This complilation, with few exceptions, sucks the life out of Hank's songs. Just like singing the blues doesn't mean you spend a night crying in your beer, Hank's music just isn't meant to be played sad. Beck's mawkish, over produced, 'Cheatin' Heart' sucks the life out of countrty music worse than anything that ever came out of Nashville. Well, almost ever. With a few exceptions, the performers treat these songs like dirges, not like the sh*t-kicking Honky Tonk classics they are. I'm not saying that every Hank songs needs to sound just like Hank, as Hank III's cut here does, but give the songs the life and energy they deserve.If you want a Hank compilation, by someone other than Hank, listen to 'Hanky Panky' from The The. It's not for the faint of heart, but then neither was Hank Williams."
3,Mixed songs - mixed album,"As most remix albums go, this one has ups and downs. To be fair, there are more ups than a typical remix album. Particularly the last two tracks, Beborn Beton's mix of Majesty and Trance to the Sun's treatment of Serenade, are quiet nice, as well as several others. However some of the remixers just didn't try to hard - Eskil Simonsson (of Covenant) is better than the not-so-exciting mix of Love the Giver (the original being absolutely beautiful) would suggest. Front 242's mix of Eventide was surprisingly attentive to the original, unlike VNV Nation's typical 'mixing in own image'. If you like Claire Voyant and are wondering what it would be like with some beats added for a bit more club-friendly vibe, get this album - there's bound to be something you like. If you want to be introduced to CV, get Time and the Maiden first."
4,You will always be Christmas to me.,"Cyndi Lauper's Christmas album is a real treat. It isn't ""just another Christmas album"". Seven of the eleven songs are originals that Cyndi co-wrote, and they are all fine songs. If you like Cyndi, you'll like this album."
4,Great curves and handling,"I like the camera very much. What is especially nice about it is the size. Yes it is rather large, but that is a plus when you are a large handed person and this is one of the most comfortable cameras that I have tried out to handle. The buttons aren't microscopic and the lens makes a pleasant handhold also. Smaller is not always better.The one thing I do not care for is the response time when taking a picture and also when viewing pictures that have been taken. The camera also tends to get a little testy when you try to do close ups.Otherwise, lovely."
3,Average digital camera,I was not impressed with this digital camera. The images were not very sharp and the color saturations are average at best. I believe there are better values out there.
1,DON'T BUY THIS - NO VIEW FINDER!,"I've had this camera for years and don't use it becauseI can't see what I'm shooting! The LCD screen is washedout from the light of day. NEVER BUY A CAMERA THATDOES NOT HAVE A VIEW FINDER ALONG WITH THE LCDSCREEN! When I first bought the camera I thought it hada view finder and ended up keeping it too long beforeI could really determine that I needed one. By that timeI couldn't return the camera! I think Sony deliberatelyomits this information on all cameras in order to sellthose with LCD screens that don't have view finders.Wouldn't you know it, SONY upgraded thismodel with a 5 pixel WITH a VIEW FINDER! This seemsto be a problem with SONY. There are just too manydifferent models that Sony should retire (pull andtake the loss) instead of confusing loyal customersand selling out dated and techno defective productsto a public that still tends to trust the SONY Brand.I think my next digital camera will be a Cannon!"
5,Christian Ethics,"This book was our seminary book on ethics. It was a great read. The usual wonderful logic, step by step approach that is characteristic of Emil Brunner. This book is well worth reading by any scholar, minister or professional in the religious area. It is a little difficult for most laypeople but for one that reads a lot of heavy work in the area it is well worth the reading. An old book by now, but a great read and full of wonderful thoughts and concepts.J. Robert Ewbank, author of ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,Makes it so much easier-,"Easy to install on the 780- easy to remove when you don't need them. They help you to make the perfect cut, without fear ofthe crown slipping . Love 'em."
1,Not all they seem to be,"If you have the DW706 double compound saw you might be disappointed with these stops. They will NOT cut crown larger that 5 1/4"" which is far less than the 6"" crown that saw is capable of. There is a review that talks about this a little more on the DW706 page."
1,The crown stops are waste of money,"I purchased the DeWal saw because of the capacity to cut 6 inch crown, in position, against the fence. The crown stops do not work with 6 inch crown. Enough said. I guess I had the impression that if the esteemed Dewalt engineers would build a saw with the capacity to handle 6 inch crown, then the stops would also work. Wrong. I built my own ""stop"" by fixing a board across the table but in the process I wasted the money I spent on the Dewalt stops. I might as well chuck them out because using a board across the table is fine. I should have known better."
3,Compatibility with DW703,"The good news is that these stops fit onto the DW703 very nicely. The bad news is that when set fully out, there is only 3 2/3 inches between the backstop and the crown stop. Not much room at all to work with, so I hope your crowns are small."
4,Must have item,"Pro - Works as expected.Cons - Have to completely unthread to remove it doing a different cut (not crown), should be quick connect. Should come with the saw and have a clip on space to keep them between uses."
4,Crown Stops,The Crown Stops work great and are easy to adjust and store. They make cutting crown fast and accurate.
3,"Not Bad, helps a little","Good product, it helps a little. For those people who say its makes crown molding easy... I would like to smack those guys with a wrench. It's not easy. The stops do make it for quick cuts on the molding. Hire a guy to do the work, I busted up my whole garage getting so pissed."
4,Handy Dandy Item,"This is very useful - for more than just Crown Molding. When used in conjunction with the clamp, the work piece will not move on the mitre saw. My only reservation is that I wish they were larger to hold larger pieces of stock."
4,Crown Molding Stops,I purchased these stops for my DW706 and they worked great. It made my Crown molding cutting much easier and more accurate. I think the job would have been much harder without these.
4,Cokin P123S Filter Graduated,"I use this filter on my Sony DSLR and on my Canon SX30 to emphasize the blue skys in landscape shots. I sometimes combine it with a ND graduated filter, the results are impressive. I highly recommend having this filter if you like doing landscape photography.Kit for Cokin P Series System. Includes: Graduated Gradual Color Square Filters (Red, Blue, Orange, Grey and Yellow) + 1 Ultra Fine Goja Microfiber Cleaning Cloth"
4,Dull Sky Enhancer,"Great filter for enhancing a dull sky. Compared to a polarizing filter, sometimes it even gives a better looking sky!"
4,A wonderfully thoughtful book,"A great book on the effect big government in the church has on people that speak their mind. As far as the reviewer that said - that this work was ""too self involved""..... It's a memoir! Read the book.. It's worth it."
2,reads like a journal,"rather than a thoughtful autobiography. When Fox has time, a more nuanced, better organized spiritual autobiography would be most welcome."
4,Great customer support,"I got this ram upgrade a while back and loved it. Them my chip burned out one day. No real reason could be found for it, it just bit the dust.So I called support and no questions asked (other then the SN and part #) I got a replacment (and faster then they had estimated too).Now for the bad news, about a year later my new chip did it again. On the good side, they were still very easy to work with and got me a replacment within 3 weeks without any questions (other then SN and part #, again).Edit: Since writing this over a year ago, my new chip has not burned out. It appears those two times may have been a fluke or caused by power surge.So, it looks like the product works well, but burns out regularly. But then you get a replacment for free and very quickly. Just save your receipt. On a side note, my chip does not have the heat spreader on it and adding one might help prevent the burn outs."
4,corks and forks,"lots of vignettes about bob's ""adventures"" and memories about the beginnings of the wine affair that is in America now.. Very entertaining."
1,A complete waste of money!,"This video is horrible. I cannot express how useless it is. It does not describe in detail how to winterize a boat. The older couple who are in the video talk about the steps required, but the video does not get specific. They spend only a few moments on how to fog the engine, but never give a detailed explanation or show anything specific. They spend more time describing how to clean upholstery and a cabin bathroom; I don't need a video for this. A complete waste of money."
4,A Good Initiation Into the History of the Knights,"If you've wondered about the Knights Templars, who they were, what they did, and why they were important, this book will introduce you to them in a way that is fairly easy to understand without a bunch of confusing lineage tracing. From the Knights' endeavors to protect pilgrims in Palestine, to their more lucrative business endeavors in Europe, to their final hurrah tied to a burning stake, Frank Sanello takes you there. He shows how the Knights played a pivotal role in the Crusades, how they invented banking, and how royal greed can overcome most any obstacle. He also covers many of the myths surrounding not only their intiation rites and their beliefs, but also the myths surrounding their legendary wealth. Did they ever really have that much wealth? Where is it now? What about the Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant? While obviously nobody actually knows for sure about these things, Sanello does cover many of the theories regarding them."
2,nothing really stood out,The Knights Templars by Frank Aneloo is an overview of how the knights Templar functioned and how they recruited their members and performed their deeds. Overall I found the book to lack something. The one big thing and this may come from Sanello being a journalist and not a historian is the lack of citations throughout the book and although there is a bibliography in the back I don't get a sense for what plugs in where to read more. I have no way to evaluate his opinions or conclusions being I do not specialize in this area at all but I found the book to jump around quite a bit and not focus in on a specific area. Perhaps those with a greater background in this area can offer more on how his book fits in to the ongoing debate but I feel I learned very little from this and I have almost no idea where to go for more information due to the way it is organized.
3,Creative Insight,"Like most others in the Rockport series this book has an intriguing preface and a conglomerate of great work. The book features several prominent firms while highlighting the designers that work there. It's a good source of information because it explains the communication problem, and then how the use of good design solved it. It does this across several different media, from the aesthetics of store architecture to the traditional printed brochure. Like the others from Rockport, certain projects are repeated in their other books, but overall, any individual with an eye for the intangible will appreciate this book."
2,ok chick flixs,"these two deal with girls finding their way into adulthood. anywhere she wants a life away from mom's drama & gets it. Beauty she wonders who daddy is, & finds out."
3,One out of two ain't bad,"I really liked ""Stealing Beauty."" I thought ""Anywhere But Here"" was not worth watching and we did not finish it. Susan Sarandon plays a mother completely out of touch with reality and it got very old very quickly. Stealing Beauty is about a young girl who goes to Tuscanny to figure out who her father really is right after she has finished High School. She has been there before and still carries a crush on a boy she meet the last time."
1,Good design but very slow in saving data,I would not buy this simply because it is soooo slow. It claims to support USB 2.0 but it is worse than the old USB 1.0 in speed performance.
2,Very Slow Write Speed,"I've been using one of these for several days now, and I'm switching back to my old SanDisk Cruzer 512. The SimpleTech USB drive looks cool, but it takes 3 or 4 times as long to write large (3-4MB) files as the much older Cruzer.Stick with the major brands like SanDisk!"
1,Worse than floppy!!!,"SLOWWWWER than the ancient floppy!!! Don't even bother with it. Takes literally 20 seconds to save a 30kb save in Word to this usb drive. My Kingston takes 1 second, and it's only Traveler I generation, not Traveler II, which is twice the speed of I."
5,Proper please....,"Great resource for learning the basics for public speaking or preparing yourself for the workforce...more or less a given, it is what is expected."
3,Incomplete shippment,No cd-rom included in this book as said in amazon. The book is good but cd-rom is not included in it. Instable title given to the book.
1,A Christmas Classic!,"Back in the early 1960s when I was a kid, this was one of about 3 albums my parents owned. Back then, the album cover was pink with a red bow on it; I understand it could be purchased for $1 with a fill up at Firestone (so that's why we had it...). For many years, the sound of Christmas was the sound of Julie Andrews singing these carols. I was delighted to find it again. The sound quality of the CD is excellent and the songs bring back the memories. Anyone looking for a classy Christmas album with a nice assortment of more and less familiar carols will likely enjoy this classic Andrews collection."
4,Nostalgic Christmas album,"This is a ""update"" of an old vinyl record of Julie Andrews from my childhood. I love the Christmas songs and Ms. Andrews' clear, crisp soprano voice. I am back in my childhood home listening to records with my family.There are three songs on the end of the cd that were not included in the original album. I find them dated and most importantly, they are not Christmas songs. I think the album would be better without them. The rest of the album I LOVE!"
1,wont work,this item down loaded the label express but will not down load dvd-vhs magic. no help from the dealer
1,No Good,"This product is a ripoff! It downloaded to my laptop ok but then when I try to use it, certain files are missing. Also, it doesn't come with any cables to hook anything up with to do anything. I got it so that I could transfer family vhs tapes to dvd but this product is worthless! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,"very simple, good product","The stand is a little small, but this is advantageous if space is a concern for you. I found that it works perfectly sitting on top of my chest of drawers. Requires simple assembly that should take no more than 5 minutes! Great product that looks great!"
4,Expectations,"When one orders something online it is really hard. The quality of this product is good. The only problem is the fact of no i nstructions to put it together. My advice is to only use the black screws on the bottom for best results. Use the brass on the outer part. When together and the way you want the parts placed, it looks really great. It looks beautiful on the table for the display."
4,"Good, ""darlin""....","My daughter (14) said that she liked the book, with the exception that the author's use of ""darlin'"" was overused. As a parent, I appreciated the focus and sentiment behind the book's concept."
1,poorly thrown together,"This book seems to be a compilation of internet searches that were copied, pasted, and transposed for the sake of making it the author's own, without a lot of fact-checking through other sources. (Strangely similar text to some of the blurbs here can be found on Web sites.) The byline should read ""compiler,"" not author. This is not a creative, genuine project that was thoughtfully and painstakingly put together, it is a mishmash of random facts found online. The author does not seem at all in touch with the Hip Hop community but was more likely interested in publishing something for the sake of calling herself a published author. This is not reference material at all."
4,BUT WHAT ABOUT....,"GREAT CD, but if they are going to title it ""the best"" it must include Tobacco Road, and nearly all of the ""Spill the Wine"" album. It should correctly have the lame title: ""Greatest Hits."""
5,much funk,this group can groove on any type of vibe just blazing funk for days.i never get tried of there records i bought outlaw recently and that one is super funky.my 4 year old daughter loves you got the power.when you here real music it never looses it's feel on you and they deliever on this set.
3,"Declaring ""War"" on Cheap Anthologies","I first owned ""The Best of War...And More"" on LP some twenty years ago, and unfortunately the CD version is not an improvement. Middleweight contestants in the arena of 1970s funk rock bands, War was far better at producing singles that albums, and as such needs to be represented by a decent anthology album. Instead, you get short edits of several songs, including ""Spill the Wine"" their debut compilation single with former Animal Eric Burdon. There's also a pointless remix of the single ""Low Rider,"" that is redunant and unnecessary. The CD package contains no booklet, only a single sheet with very little information about the band. And at only 13 tracks total, it is a very skimpy collection.Overall, a shoddy anthology from a decent band that deserves better treatment."
2,Edited versions and a major omission bring this one down,"Any War compilation that doesn't include ""The World Is A Ghetto"" really shouldn't be called a ""best-of"". I just don't understand why Rhino/Avenue chose to omit this song, yet included two versions (the original and a remix) of ""Low Rider"". I realize that ""The World Is A Ghetto"" appears on ""The Best Of War And More, Volume 2,"" but we shouldn't HAVE to buy Volume 2 to get this song. Then again, maybe this is why it was omitted from Volume 1.Also, ""Spill The Wine,"" ""The Cisco Kid,"" ""All Day Music"" and ""Slippin' Into Darkness"" are edited versions that were supplied to radio stations, not the longer versions that appeared on the regular 45s (The edited version of ""Spill The Wine"" keeps turning up on War compilations. You need to pick up ""Eric Burdon Declares 'War'"" to get the unedited version.)"
2,If it isn't broke?,"This is a bad compilation of a great band. If you notice, there are two Best Of's. That is because this album is missing some great songs. The much better, 1976 Greatest Hits was only released as a Gold CD, is now out of stock, and is sorely missed."
4,"I Declare ""WAR"" On This Disc!!","Hey Rhino, if you're gonna do War, DO WAR!(The un-edited version of ""City/Country/City,"" ""Deliver The Word,"" ""The World Is A Ghetto,"" ""Southern Part Of Texas"")This band built it's rep on long,loose free jams, so any War ""Hits"" compilation should mirror that."
4,A good series,"It's your typical ""the situation gets so bad that only one person gets everything sorted out in the end"". Yeah there're some interesting crime stories but for me what's really interesting is the sub-stories that accompany the crime solving stories, like his personal life and the way he deals with obstacles. The show is fresh enough for anyone wanting something a bit different. Can't wait for the new season."
3,its ok not as good as the first one,not as good as the first one love the actor did not like the second season i like season 1 better
3,lukewarm,"Loved the first series, but found the second one disappointing. It lacked the intensity of the first series, and the two stories were somehow too similar."
4,LUTHER 2,Enjoyed this actors potrayal and acting. Once you begin watching you can't stop until the end is over and done.
5,"Luther, Season 2",Excellent acting I can't wait to see what's in store for the 3rd season of Luther. I will be watching!!!
5,Luther - Looking Forward to Season 3,"Spot on Suspense. Great character development of all the regulars and guests, in particular, Luther and Alice. The grIzzly murders are intimated instead of shocking you with the grotesque. Certainly not your textbook police investigation. Yet, not so far out in left field. Viewers who are curious in nature and prefer to use their mind will enjoy the twist and turns woven through each episode and through the series."
4,Writing is slipping in Season 2,"The writing in the second season is degenerating, as happens with many series. Guess the original writers go off with their pay? Or else just run out of good ideas, resorting to stepped-up gratuitous violence and deflated verisimilitude. Directing flagging a bit--how many more follow-shots of John's swaying shoulders do we need? Someone's even willing to let editing goofs slide by--the sound of John's shaking the killer's dice while both his diceless hands are clearly visible--for more than a nano-second, too. (Unless the idea was a sound-overlap edit for effect, in which case the effect was only confusion for this viewer.) Sorry, but reluctantly must remove a star from my original 5--although I'll watch all the episodes. ""Luther"" could fall apart even a little more around the edges, but would still be worth watching if it had nothing else going for it but actor Idris Elba's irresistible portrayal. He's mesmerizing."
4,Luther still quite entertaining,"Luther 2 was shorter than what I had anticipated but the character development is still great. Understanding that Luther is going through a period of mourning after Ep6 Luther 1, he's trying to find himself/his center of being in his crazy maze of a life. Nevertheless, he is who he is and he lives among his work.I didn't like characterization of serial killers...too young, to predictable, wish they were more edgy/freaky/weird. Boys just out of puberty attempting to be serial killers...did not make me quiver at all.I missed Alice...love the banter between she and Luther. What flavor they add to the show. We need her back in a big way in Luther 3 and there will be a Luther 3.If you love good acting, character development and awesome shots of London you will like Luther 2."
3,Not as Good as Season 1,"This is an excellent show and Mr. Elba is spectacular but not as well written as Season 1.Problem is Season 1 is so good, you'll have to watch Season 2 ;-)"
5,Gritty,Season one was epic. Season 2 carries heavier story lines and is a little heavy handed on the gritty-ness. Still one of the best shows in a long time.
3,Disappointed only two - 2 part episodes- be 5 stars if it were more,Disappointed there wasn't more of Luther. We are used to much longer seasons in the United States. The show though is 5 stars all the way. I'd give it 10 if I could. Idris Elba is perfect for this role- a morally challenged DCI trying to make it through the mess his divorce and ex-wife's subsequent death have left him in from season 1. He knows what the right thing to do is- but it is not always the justice he feels compelled to see happen. And for Luther justice will win out no matter how it is served and what emotional price he pays. Please bring back a 3rd season and give us a few more episodes. A real fan was left wanting much more time spent w/Luther.
1,Luther,Unfortunately I can't review this DVD as I didn't realize that different countries have different zone codes and I am unable to play this DVD on my DVD player. Very disappointing. It would be good if Amazon had some kind of advice for purchasers of overseas products.
4,Great shears!,"Contrary to the other review, these shears are very good. I have an Italian spitz pom mix and she has a top silkier coat and the bottom coat. I can groom her myself with these shears without having to spend $60-$70 on a professional groom. They trim her coat perfectly the way it grows naturally. I had previously bought other shears that were much more expensive and back they went because they did not trim! These were less expensive and trim perfectly. Give them a try and you'll love them."
4,scissors,"These scissors are great for learning how to blend, and for first time grooming. They are worth the money. However, if you are looking for a really nice pair of scissors I would recommend spending a little more money."
1,Thinning shears were not effective,"Unfortunately, these thinning shears did not work for cutting my dog's fur. Most of the other thinning shears available seemed quite pricey, but maybe you get what you pay for."
2,"Good period 1830 Samurai Flick, Too Many Drunks, Dumb Plot","There were parts of this movie that I actually enjoyed; There would be five minutes here, 8 minutes there, 20 seconds somewhere else, and then an actual 12 minute section, and so on. In other words, about half of the movie is good, 15% very good, and much of the rest is pointless crap just shot for effect. The good parts were worth it to me because I'm always searching for good period Japanese flicks. They should have spent more time on plot development. The drunken ronin fighting at the end was a huge spoiler. He should have been sober. Bummer."
3,Good,"Good, but not great, really. If you're expecting this film to be full of action you'll be disapointed. Nice to have if you're a Shintaro Katsu fan and love period films."
2,"Sorry, not that good","Sorry, I have to disagree with the favorable reviews about this movie. The character development was not good, the editing in some scenes poor, and the action was...sloppy. I really tried to like the movie because I'm a big fan of Chanbarra film, but Ronin Gai will never be placed in my 'must have' catagory. It does not possess the quality or class of any Akira Kurosawa samurai epic."
1,Lame at best,"The one thing that got out of this film was, don't trust the amazon ratings. I am a avid fan of Japanese cinema and this film was a disappointment at every level. I can't think of a film that I liked less...I wanted to compare it to ""Imprint"" but it doesn't even stack up to that...and that's pretty sad."
5,"Heart of Steel, Sword of Bamboo","For a comprehensive and excellent review, see Kim Anehall's comments. A tiny bone to pick, however, is the assessment of the close of the opening duel, when the bystander rushes to the fallen duelist and exchanges swords with the slain man. After he absconds with his prize, it becomes clear that the sword he has left with the corpse is bamboo ( another character breaks it in outrage). This indicates the extreme poverty of the thief, since he has clearly been forced by circumstance to sell his sword and has carried a bamboo sword to conceal this disgrace . A similar circumstance occurs in the more recent ""Twilight Samurai"" when the viewer is told that Sanada Hiroyuki's character had to sell his sword to bury his wife.The final battle contains some of the best swordplay ever filmed; and oh, that Katsu Shintaro, perhaps his most poignantly heroic scene ever!"
2,hmm Ok,"Its ok,GP just reprises a lot of his tracks from the 1991 release. There's really no suprises on this one. But the tracks are not even that good, the only track that got my attention was ""Love 4 Gangstas"" it's really nice for the dead homies."
4,2 Flics on 2 discs.....,"Hey, these are both classic SciFi movies! I really like that they are on seperate discs, in a slim-pack, AND the price would be nice for each, BUT NO!, you get 2 for the price of 1!!"
3,They have landed.,This is a good combo if you are into aliens and space movies. Although my children were not born when they made these they still enjoyed the movies. It is fun watching the reaction on the faces who are seeing the movie for the first time. I recommend this for family night.
4,great bargain,These were 2 good movies and the acting was great. I'm a SciFi fan and this fit the bill.
5,A Health Plan That Can Really Work!,"I have only recently read her book. And haven't followed her whole plan yet. But I had already been eating mostly this way for about almost 2 years. And I feel a big difference. After having followed ""Nourishing Traditions"" way for several years. I had 30 different ailments prior to the ""wise traditions"" way. But, I too had difficulty healing some of the last few ailments. I am definitely going to incorporate her approach into my own and feel very confident that this approach will be successful."
4,Good health,This book is exstream but has many good areas that should be considered if you want to change your life and improve your health. No one book has all the answers and this is just a part of the story.
1,Contour Freedom-A No Go,I have lower back pain and had hoped that the contour of the pillow as well as the angle would help. After using it for only 2 days I found my back hurt more at the end of the day.
3,How about a cheaper version without the massage,Based on reviews I knew the massage aspect of this product wasn't worth it but I do like the way it fits into my back and for that reason I would recommend it.
2,pretty satisfied,"I like the product, except the massage feature is really loud and not doing much. So, I am not using the massage at all.Other than that I like the product!"
4,It's true what they say.,"As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708, the one I think should have been included with the saw (or at least priced more reasonably). If it was...I'd give it 5 stars. Sturdy construction, particularly considering it's an offshore-built product. It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece, but that's forgiven due to the ease of removal (for switching sides, removing for steep beveling, etc)."
5,Good Stuff,"I'm an amatuer woodworker and I always appreciate things that help make my projects go a little easier and little more accurately. This is definitely one of them. It's a extra ""hand"" to hold things in place when your concentration is needed for sharp objects whirling around at high rates of speed. Recommend you get one of these and use it."
3,DW7082 on DW716,"Clamp works well, although it only works to clamp the work piece to the work surface. There is no provision to use the clanmp to hold the workpiece against the fence. The clamp seems somewhat overpriced."
4,Massive --but really the price!,If your reading this you discovered that your Dewalt came without a clamp. This is the mother of all clamps. Heavy duty is the word I would use. Fits perfectly in the oversize hole in your Mitre saw. Reaches over the oversize fence on your mitre saw as well. I tried to find any other manufacturer clamp to use as a substitute but no this is it for Dewalt. You 'have to' buy this one if you want a clamp. You either return the saw or give up and pay the ridiculous price. Is it a $80 part. No. Its more like a $40 part. Do you have a choice no. Do you need 2? I don't think so. Its massive. Has a quick release on the screw down. Good size knob you can work wearing gloves. Does all this make up for the price. No.
5,Get Two!,"These really increase the versatility of safe, precision sawing operations.Two clamps simplify quick changes and/or duplication cutting, if you do much of it from either side of the table. I also have the table extension supports on both sides of my miter saw to facilitate ease of cutting longer stock to either side of the blade. It's saved me hours of set up time (and shop space, too, as it has replaced my radial arm saw)."
5,Ouch but nice,Just added this clamp to my new Dewalt DW718 sliding miter saw. This saw did come with one clamp but I decided that I better have another one for the other side of my material I would be cutting for safety measures. It would have been nice if Dewalt would have included this clamp instead of the one that came with the DW718 but I am sure to keep costs down we are lucky to even get one material hold down clamp. This DW7082 clamp is way better than the one that comes with the saw and is more heavy duty with a quick take-up button that saves a lot of time screwing the threaded rod to tighten the clamp. It would be nice to have both clamps like this one but I can't justify buying another DW7082 clamp seeing as now I have one for each side of the blade. This DW7082 material hold down clamp will now become my primary clamp though and the one that came with the saw will only be used when I think two clamps are really necessary.
3,Like 'em.,"My review will mirror some of the thoughts in other reviews.These are quality clamps, very well-built and easy to use. They provide the safety you'd want while working with the saw. They do seem a bit pricey considering the size and simplicity but it's easily worth it.The only real ""cons"" I have is that I expected to be able to clamp items closer to the blade, rather than 4 or more inches away. Now for anything over 6 inches away from the blade I'm comfortable using my hands anyways, so I was buying these clamps with the hopes of getting them in fairly close. I also expected the clamps to ""get out of the way"" so that when I'm making complex cuts I don't have to work around the blade or motor hitting the clamps."
5,nice work!,"I was able to get this cd back in 2000 while I was in Europe, so I didn't have to pay this ridiculous price. But, the price aside, what you get on this cd is a collection of really good, though simple and basic, instrumental tracks. Some have a sense of Folk Implosion to them and are a bit darker... but all in all, there are some really nice tracks here. I've always been kinda fond of the album. The Rudy Trouve tracks are interesting as well, though their mood is a bit different.So no, don't expect another Sentridoh record."
3,"Decent, if you're interested.","For the major Barlowphiles out there (and I think I am starting reach that level of fandom) I would reccomend you get this disc. Yes, it is only instrumental cuts, but there are tweleve of them and they are all Lou originals, only available on this disc to my knowledge. I admit the import price is a bit steep. I bought this record in France pretty cheaply this past Summer so I felt good about it. The twelve cuts are very cool, at times mellow, at times very atmospheric and all around very interesting for the discerning listener. Also, the other guy on the disc, Rudy Trouve, is interesting to listen to. Making it a little more worth it, since I had not heard of this artist before picking up this disc. So if you really really like Sebadoh/Sentridoh/Folk Implosion than you should have this, from a completists perspective. But if you are just looking for more Lou, save your money on this and pick up a couple Sebadoh full-lengths for the same price."
2,Come on Lou!,"Let's keep this review simple. First off I had no clue what this record was, besides the fact that Lou was on it. I wish I would have read a review (but I couldn't find one.) The main dissapointment is all of the songs are musicals, and the music isn't awesome, it sometimes is kind of screwy and other times it is pretty good, but still for the import price this cd isn't worth it unless your a diehard fan, and even then you'll be dissapointed."
4,Beautiful,"heartfelt lyrics and a beautiful voice makes this cd one of the best I've ever owned. At times it can be a little different ... but, In an amazing way."
5,Price Pros Product,"This is actually the 2nd review on a shipment of 3 products from the Price Pros. My 1st review was mixed - I loved the product (excellent quality and design), but I paid WAY too much (almost $100) for expedited shipping (1-3 days) and the product arrived in 9 days. I have since removed that review and here is why...to my absolute shock and pleasure I just got off the phone with Price Pros (they called me) whereby they explained that the product took longer to get to them then they expected and hence the unacceptable delay for expedited. With that note Price Pros refunded me the difference between expedited and standard shipping. So not only was their product great but their response and customer service showed me that they truly value their customers. Would I buy from these guys again now? Most definitely. I highly recommend the product and can now highly recommend the seller. Thanks Price Pros...you turned a dissatisfied customer into an advocate."
5,"Fasacinating, intense, joyful, profound---a delight","These four CDs survey the best of Chinese traditional music, focusing on the four types of instruments: plucked instruments, bowed instruments, wind instruments, and percussion. The variety and range keeps this set from ever getting dull, and the music touches every conceivable emotion. This is a set to be experienced. My only regret is that there aren't more volumes in the series. If you are hesitant about this sounding like Chinese restaurant music, don't worry. This seems to be the genuine article, not influenced by Western music or muzak. Some of the instrumentalists on these CDs take your breath away with their technical proficiency and power. If you think you'd like to try some authentic Chinese music, this may be the only set you'll ever need."
2,Not for 12 1/2' DW734,"Bought this to replace dust hood that came with planer. Though it looked different I went by the statements saying it fit the DW734. It does with much modification and one three handed person (two can't get to it and you need three hands to hold the cover, the blade guard and the screw & screwdriver. I give it a couple of stars because it is more solid."
5,unexpected performance,"I needed something to prevent my workshop from becoming a cloud of dust each time I used my planer. this product exceeded all expectations when hooked uo to the shop vac, great product all around."
4,"Works very well, mounting a little micky mouse.","The dust hood changes everything on the planer. Were once was a pile of dust and fibers covering half the garage, now there is so few chips you could count them. I hooked the planer up to a 1 1/2horse delta dust collector with a 4 inch line, but my shop vac worked ok as well. Definately a good buy.... but the mounting is a little shacky with the way the screws go in to the point where you might screw things up if you do it too often. Basically, you have to leave it on, which wouldn't be bad except that you can't close the outfeed extension with the dust hood on. This means that there is not an easy way to transport or store the planer once the hood is mounted. I had to build a stand on wheels after I added the hood which took up alot of space in my small shop."
5,The REAL Deal....,"Although I didn't enjoy ""Gone Gone Gone"" as much as The New Deal's self-titled debut, it's still an amazing piece of work. The title track, Gone Gone Gone, is an absolute masterpiece, and even those who dislike electronica and techno will find themselves enjoying this song. Other favorites on the album include Home, Episode 7, Homewrecker, and Don't Blame Yourself.The female vocals on this album are wonderful, but I believe that their presence is one of the reasons I didn't enjoy this album as much. I enjoy The New Deal's music much more without the vocals, and although they included sound bites in their first album, there was no actual singing. Don't get me wrong though, this album is still amazing, and I highly recommend it.If you're interested in electronica, techno, funk, or jazz, check out The New Deal. I promise you won't be disappointed!"
5,Excellence - now available in disc form.,"The first time I heard this album, I thought it was a bunch of nonsense. Oh, the folly of youth. I don't know what to say about it. I'd like to compare it to another band, but that would be pretty difficult. I guess its similar to The Orb, perhaps the Disco Biscuits. But thats not important. This album is just awesome. Read somebody else's review for verbosity."
4,"Good, but..",This album is a good album but strays a bit much from their self-titled album that I was first acquainted with. Still a nice collection of songs and interesting electronica.
3,A Thin Line,"Solomita draws us into the real world of big city crime solving. An ""old timer"" cop, Stanley Moodrow shows a rookie that many of the rules for law enforcement are established by people who have never walked the streets of the inner city as a cop.The story starts with the reader knowing ""who done it"" so the intrigue is how will he be caught. The characters are real and the line between villain and hero are blurred. A moving suspenseful story."
3,Great! Until you need service!,"Yes its a great saw. However if anything goes wrong don't hold your breath hopeing Dewalt will honor the warranty. Now I just have a great looking yellow sculpture. If there is one iota of moisture in the shop (above 75%) don't count on this machine working past a few months!JeffSoon after this was posted I was emailed by Dewalt saying a rep ""would soon contact"" me....hey fellas, I'm still waiting...."
2,Great 2 year saw,"I have been scrolling for 20+ years. Not long ago I bought the 4th Dewalt DW788. Still Disappointed! I bought my first Dewalt about 10 years ago. worked great (low vibration/blade shake). At the beginning of the second Year it started surging and screwing up, I took it to a qualified repair shop. He said the motor was shot. Replacement motors are well over $200. So I bought a new Dewalt. 2 years later, same problem, so this time i bought a new motor. One year later that stopped working. I have now bought my 4th DW778. It has a terrible front to back blade vibration that I can't adjust out of it. Good design, NO reliability.I would love to buy the next better saw out there but at twice the price what will I end up with?"
1,Terrible repair cost -- Watch OUT!!!,"I bought this saw 2 years ago to do a small project. I now only buy what is considered to be the best tool I can afford in order to avoid having to buy a second better one later. I used this saw for about 2 hours total and didn't have occasion to touch it again until recently. After 5 minutes of cutting some 5/8"" plywood pieces the fuse blew. I replaced it but it blew again. Took the saw to the local DeWalt auth. service center. They tell me the motor is no good and it will cost me ... to fix! They called DeWalt to explain it was in new cond. but DeWalt says it's out of warranty. So if your saw fails be ready to throw it out and buy an new one."
3,Quality control is spotty,"I received this saw recently. Unfortunately, the table was machined poorly, and the blade would not center in the hole in the table. I returned the saw for a replacement. The second one had the table machined correctly. I see this complaint on the scroll saw forums. It is a shame that Dewalt is having quality control issues with this saw."
1,do not buy,"I bought this saw less than a year ago. With less than ten hours on it, the motor burned out. Dewalt told me to take it to a service center which I did. They replaced the motor, but after getting it back I have problems with the saw stopping in mid cut! To make matters worse, I t will not hold a #2 blade in the bottom blade holder. I use Olson blades, and after ruining a dozen, I called Dewalt again, and once again they told me to take it back for repairs. Since the closest repair facility is 50 miles from where live, this is an uneeded time and expense to me. To make matters worse, the service person I talked to told that was "" A fragile machine ""! I have been scrolling for 15 years, I bought this to replace a Delta 16 inch that finally died. Funny how I never once had to take it in for repairs in all thse years!!!!!"
1,variable speed not working,Length:: 0:50 MinsThe variable speed on my saw is not consistant. The speed control seems to have a mind of it's own. Maybe it is just the one that was shipped to me. This was an open box item from Amazon.
4,Best for the price,"If you read my review of the $200 Dremel, you'll know I tried that saw first because I didn't want to spend over about $200. Unfortunately, my Dremel experience was bad, I exchanged it for the DeWalt, and am happy with the latter.The DeWalt would earn 5 stars from me, but for the following: the light tends to ""droop"" of it own weight (this can be frustrating at first, but ends up not being a big deal); the blower is anaemic (but so are others I've tried); and the warranty is only 1 year (Dremel is 2); the price is a bit ""pricey""--but the product is definitely better than the less expensive machines.In all other respects (throat size, materials, vibration, motor--even though its rating is a low 1.3 amps, these 1.3 amps are all you'll need-- speed range, bevel capability, blade changing) the DeWalt is a very good product."
1,Problems Right out of the box with blade!! Seems to be common..,"After purchasing this saw, I read a review written recently by Jay. I had the same problem with the table screw holes not tapped in the correct location causing the blade to hit the table(only off by about 1/8th""). I called Dewalt and the service rep. told me that he wasn't aware of any problems with this saw. After speaking with the rep, he told me that I could file the holes that support the table. I asked if this would void the warranty and he said no. I filed the arm screw holes, however I am not happy with Dewalt. The saw seems to run good, but I just can't recommend it to anyone until Dewalt does something to resolve this issue. The only way I would buy it is from a local store so it can be checked out. Sorry for the lengthy review..GOOD LUCK!"
1,Not quality,I have two of these saws in the junior high where I teach. Both had endless electrical problems. The saws only had light use before they began to break down.
5,Dewalt DW788,"Ordered this saw from Amazon. Received much sooner than I expected. Got it set up and used it. It was ""love at first sight""! I have had two previous scroll saws from different manufacturers, both were pure junk compared to this scroll saw. This DeWalt DW 788 is actually a pleasure to use. I do a lot of inside cuts and nothing compares to this saw that I have ever used in regards to blade setup, ease of inside cuts."
5,Absolutely fantastic scroll saw,"Just got the saw set up and operating - in comparing my old Delta saw, it was like going from a Model A ford to a Lexus auto - a very quiet, virtually vibration free, easy to change blades and just overall, a much faster cutting machine - the tension control is super also - went thru a whole project without breaking a blade which just didn't happen with the Delta unit. A great investment for the scroll saw hobbyist!!"
5,Reduced my cutting time by 1/3,I was using a Delta scroll saw on a project with 30 identical cuts and each was taking me 15 minutes. Then I bought the DW-788 and the same cut was now taking 10 minutes! I think it has something to do with the way the blade moves more straight up and down rather than swinging through an arch.Do yourself a favor and also buy the easy-lift kit on ebay. It holds the DW-788 arm up out of the way for easily inserting the blade in inside cuts.Al Stewartphotocutouts
5,"DeWalt great buy, excellent saw.",Have used the saw repeatedly since it was purchased and it is of the best quality. The buying experience was quick and the no shipping charge was a great addition to the purchase. Extremely happy with transaction.
5,MUCH Cheaper at Grizzly,Grizzly sells a combo including the DW788 with Dewalt stand and light regularly for $499 and is on a spring sale for $50 less than that. All new. Save about $180 over Amazon and other sellers. Can't understand why the price is so much higher elsewhere. (Grizzly shipping + $21.00). This is one of the few instances where Amazon is not even competitive... unfortunately.UPDATE: 10FEB2010 - I see Amazon has finally reduced the price of this unit to a reasonable level that competes with the lowest found elsewhere. Glad to see Amazon catching on! If you are looking at scroll saws... look no further. This is the bomb! There is no better at this price point.
1,Great design but doesn't last.,"This saw has a great design, nice big table, quiet running, extra easy blade change. I use this saw about 5 hours a week. Gone through two motors in two years. Too expensive to be a throw away saw........."
4,nice machine,I have owned this saw for a couple months. I have played with it enough to get a feel for it but I have not worked with it enough to be an expert.Strengths:1) The cast iron table is nice (large and smooth)2) The saw doesn't vibrate hardly at all in fact I don't even have mine mounted yet. I have simply put it on a work bench and the saw stays put.3) The saw does make very nice cutsWeaknesses:1) It's heavy for moving (is also part of its strengths)2) It seems to be a little underpowered for larger stockOverall it is a nice machine with a fairly hefty price tag.
4,the best money i ever spent,"after working several years with another cheaper saw, i was tired of broken blades and constant replaceing worn linkage. this dewalt saw is so wonderful to work with, i supplement my income with scroll saw projects so i don't have time for saw problems and this dewalt has no problems. it may cost more but it is well worth the price.amazon.com was a complete joy to do business with. the saw and stand arrived two days after i orderd them. the light arrived exactly when they said it would.i am one happy customer and proud owner of a quality dewalt scroll saw,stand and light set up. carl williams,smithville ms."
2,Poor quality machines.,"We've been using these saws in our middle school wood shop for the last five years. In that amount of time, I've lost track of how many times I've had these in for repairs. It's more of a hobby saw that can not stand up to serious use. In addition, one saw that we purchased, stopped working a week after we took it out of the box."
2,owner of saw,"I was so excited to receive my new Dewalt Scroll Saw, however since I recieved it back in November of 2010 I have had nothing but problems with it. It would just stop working for no reason, I took it to the approved warranty shop which is 30 miles+ away to have them call me and tell me that nothing was wrong with it, well I brought it home and proceeded to use it and it stopped working again, I was so mad that I hit it with my fist on the work table and it started up and ran so I continued on with my project and numerous times it would quit and numerous times I would hit it with my fist and it would turn back on. I took it back to the shop and they could not even get it to turn on, they replaced several parts on it and it is working again, however the tension lever does nothing my blade is not taught like it should be. I am so frustrated and would Dewalt to send me a new one. I am going to write to them next."
1,I will never buy anything made by DeWalt again !!!,"I'm sure this (DW788 type 2)is a wonderful saw. It looks very nice on its stand, with NO BLADE in it. Apparently DeWalt let my saw out of their manufacturing facility without the thumb screws needed to mount the blade. It is a totally worthless piece of junk without the ability to mount a blade.So, I call DeWalt and they tell me that they have the parts I need, but it will take 7 - 10 days for them to get them to me. I asked if they could Fedx the parts since I need the saw to cut a piece of wood now. The woman on the phone told me that they don't do that.I told her that although I have several DeWalt products in my workshop that this one would be the last I ever purchased. She didn't seem that concerned. I really hate to see companies when they start to go down. AOL did it, Blockbuster was next, and now DeWalt. They seem to forget that they can't sell products if they don't have customers."
4,Dewalt DW788 Scroll Saw,Recieved my new saw in a short time. Saw worked wonderfully for me. Only minor problem I can find is the need for a better system of attaching the blades in the saw. I had some trouble with the blade slipping from under the set screw fastener.
3,Blade change,"This is a bum saw to change blades. Apparently, there was a misdesign in a ""wedge"" inside that keeps the arms too far apart and therefore, the blade is ""too short"". There is about 1/8 of an inch on each end to fasten to. There should be 3/8's or so. The earlier model Type 1 is very good in this regard. But this later model, the Type 2, is no good. DeWalt admits there is a ""slight problem"" with blade change but so far, no cure. We are stuck with it.Other than the blade change problem, I really like the machine and it runs circles around all other scroll saws I have had or still have.... once the blade is changed. It takes quite a bit of time and patience to change a blade."
3,Great saw with one exception,"I recently upgraded from a craftsman to the Dewalt. I have been happy with the almost vibration free operation, easy blade changes, and large 20"" bed. The only problem I have had is the hold down foot. Dewalt uses a large hold down foot that is constructed of a bent rod that attaches to one side of the upper saw arm. The attachment of the foot is not very solid. The foot interfears with the view of your work piece and tends to fall down into the cutouts when doing fretwork. This causes your work piece to bind up and then suddenly jump free as you apply more preasure to move the piece. It can be frustrating when working on an intricate piece. Also, the size of the foot makes cutting small pieces almost impossible without removing it all togehter. My old Craftsman had a small V shaped hold down foot that worked very well. If Dewalt would fix this one problem, they would have a great saw."
5,dewalt dw788 dream machine,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for myself, after the short time it took me to assemble the stand & put the light fixture on , I started to do some delicate inside cuts with this dream machine.Believe me I emailed, called, sent in for information on all the saws I could find, I am glad I bought the dewalt 788 saw. I have no connections with this company, I am just a hobbiest who found a new toy with nothing but joy, for the money you cant go wrong, you'll be impressed with the size of the table to the lack of vibration."
2,"Some nice features but,","If you like to saw out a few items in the garage then this will work for you, but don't expect it to perform day after day in awoodshop. First be careful of the blade holder. It is made of caste iron and if tightened too much will break. A replacement takes weeks to get. The blade tension lever will wear out which requires you to tape the lever into position. We have also ""burnt out"" two motors in a eight month period.Having said all that it realy is a good machine for the hobby person. The blade is easy to change, the table easy to adjust, and the variable speed is handy. Further, Dewalt has been very helpful in their customer service. We have also tried the comparable Delta saw, and find the Dewalt easyer to operate.In its price range, I would say it is the best available."
5,Great Saw,"I bought a scroll saw back many years ago. I remember I kept it one day. It vibrated so bad it would not stay on the bench. I decided this time to spend a little extra money and try the Dewalt 788. Boy am I glad I did. No vibration, all adjustments up front and easy to get to. This is really a great saw. I highly reccomend it. I don't think you will be sorry."
1,Two dead Ducks,"I use 2 of these at a middle school woodshop. We have had nothing but problems with them. Now before you think it is because of the hours of use, let me explain. When they are running, they are only on for two hours 4 days a week. Within the first 2 weeks, they both died. The repair shop took their time (3 months) to fix and then they broke again a month later. Back to the shop and 4 more months! Both circuit boards went out and the linkage get very sloppy. I just had another circuit board go out this week. I wish I could replace these, any ideas?"
3,Good for the hobbiest,"I think the DeWalt DW788 is a very nice saw for light hobby work. The cutting is very smooth, all the controls are up front and easy to access.The only problem I have with the saw is the hold down bar. It is designed in a such a way that if you change thickness of woods a lot, you have to readjust it and this seems rather difficult at times. When you reapply pressure to the holding screw the bar moves down tighter. It takes a few corrections to keep it from pressing to hard on the wood or not enough.Overall I think it runs very smooth and can be a great addition to any hobbiest looking for a reasonably priced scroll saw."
3,I Thought This was Supposed to be The Best..,"This saw came to me in good condition. No complaints there. However when I assembled the saw, which was quick and easy, I found that the blade doesn't line up with the center of the cutout in the table. In fact it is touching the side of the hole. I attempted to adjust the table by loosening the 2 mounting screws and was able to very slightly adjust it so that the blade was not actually touching, but it is barely clearing the throat opening in the table. I personally belive that is poor workmanship. The saw operates but the workmanship leaves something to be desired."
3,shirt sleeve is really long,"i love the shirt, except the sleeves are 4'' too long. the chest and length fits perfectly"
5,Tuxedo Shirt - perfect fit,"The shirt was received in record time for a last minute important event. My husband has a large neck and we could not find his size in the store without having to pay an incredible price. The size selected fit him fine. The shirt was nice material and had the tie and accessories were, as promised. I was informed of the purchase the entire way to my doorstep.Tuxedo Shirt - Wing Collar 1/8"" Pleat 65% Polyester 35% CottonI would recommend using them again in the future."
3,"Works, but not a super fit","Got this for a wedding to replace an old tuxedo shirt. I had read other reviews and I thought based on them that this would be a nice permanent replacement for my tuxedo shirt. Well, unfortunately, the old adage is true here - you get what you pay for. This review is based on the fit. I'm 6'1"", 190 lbs, athletic buildPros:-Its a formal shirt-Its a nice white, not off-white-It comes with free, horrible plastic black buttons (worthless, but unexpected)Cons:-Horrid Fit - very loose in the body and the arms were a bit wanky-Stray string hanging on a few buttonsUnfortunately, Fit is everything for me when it comes to fashion. This shirt did not fit me well but I imagine it may work out better for someone who has a beer belly and some fat arms."
5,L LOVE IT,L LOVE THIS BOOK OR ANYTHING IN THE JARHEAD SERIES I WISH A NEW ONE WOULD COME OUTOH LA LA
1,Very little in the way of insight,"I picked up this book, hoping to find questions that would truly help me get to know my partner better. Instead what I found were a lot of short generalizations, blithe answers, and questions I couldn't care less about. The sealed pages at the back (that contain the answers) are annoying and unwieldy. Finally, Ms. Corn (or her editors) should invest in a proofreader. There are so many mistakes all over this book, I felt like asking for my money back! You're much better off with ""The Book of Questions"" by Gregory Stock, or any of the other ""question""-type books out there. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Swatch Watch,"I got this watch as I wanted something simple, with a slight retro feel to it. The watch certainly fit the bill. The clock face is large and easy to read and the basic controls easy to manipulate. The only bit of complaint I have is that the leather strap is quite stiff, even after a period of use. I am constantly shaping it to fit the curvature of my wrist as it quite often tries to straighten out on its own and causing the watch to sit at an awkward angle on my wrist. Personally, I thought the strap was a bit thin for the size of its clock face and on my average sized wrist, that's of course personal preference so you may not think so."
5,Good stuff,My wife is pregnant and she loves this stuff on her belly as it expands and stretches. Nice aroma as well.
3,"External connectors don't hold cables tightly, had to RMA.","After tearing my hair out for a couple of hours convinced that I had a failing hard drive, I discovered my real problem were the external connectors on the bracket. I found I could reproduce my hard drive ""failure"" problem by barely wiggling the cables plugged into them. The external connectors are too loose; they do not securely grip the cables plugged into them.The bright side is that Cables To Go is RMAing this product and sending me a replacement without hassle."
5,A Good Idea,I have several external hdd's with SATA connections. This adapter proved to be exactly what I needed. Easy quick installation to my existing available connectors on the motherboard.
4,It works...,I purchased this in combination with the StarTech eSATA USB to SATA External HDD Dock for Dual 2.5 or 3.5in Hard Drive...The cables are long enough and the mount is of standard fair. The eSATA external cables connect with ease. I didn't have any issues with the connections both to the motherboard and externally to the docking station. Really easy to install... I would recommend this adaptor.
2,Serial cable,I tried to use this cable for my MAC Pro but the heads are too big for the case and in-turn the fan housing is bent. I have taken the cable out due the problem. Un-happy with the product but happy with Amazon..
5,Absolutely FANTASTIC book!,"Lee Hammond is the best I have ever seen (in book form). She goes into such detail to teach you how draw everything from eyes to noses to hair. She tells you what paper to use, what pencils, and how important it is to use good products. She is super! I believe that I now have every one of her books, with the exception of the animal ones, which I will get in the future! I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
4,ART BLAKEY,I WAS LOOKING FOR IMAGES OF ART BLAKEY IN THE BIG BAND OF BILLY ECKSTINEAnd he is present !!It is ironic that other beboppers made a start in the Billy Eckstine band !
1,I am dissappointed,"Don't cha is a great song, but I was looking for the explicit busta rhymes version. Apparently, the only way to get that version is to buy the expensive import cd.The long version on this album is just the normal don't cha, the 3:38 minutes song is the busta rhymes radio edit."
3,Don't Cha?,"Only has 3 different versions of the same song.You can see the music video of Don't Cha on your pc.Other than that, not much to it. I mean how many different ways can you remix ONE song? lol. Don't spend over 5 bucks on this even though it's imported, not worth more than that."
5,Keith McArthur,"I don't know much about this book, but that Keith McArthur is one sexy dude. Did you see that jacket photo? Whoa..."
4,"Buy for ""Bolerish""","This is the soundtrack for Brian dePalma's stylish but forgettable movie of the same name. ""Bolerish"" is breathtaking, the rest is quirky, very modern, and not to my taste. Probably not worth the ridiculously high price unless you're a real fan of this composer."
2,Hard Going/ Old School,"I have struggled to get through this book. It's very old school, not very specific in places, and lacks agility required for today's market place. No doubt the practices contained within it HAVE been relevant, just not too sure how relevant they can be in today's faster paced environments - for example: the depths of `test reporting'...who has time....and to who's benefit?"
5,Must Have for all Test Managers,This review is mainly to mention the excellent support I received from Author Rex Black.I had a technical problem with the old version of the ebook and found very little support from amazon to fix my problem. I contacted the author Rex Black and he personally made sure that the publisher was contacted and that my problem was resolved.Regarding the old book it is one of the best books written on test management. I have been using this book since 2003. I have the hard copy version and the ebook version which serves as an excellent reference book on any test project.Must have for any test manager.
2,"Some Good Info, But Generally Lacks Focus, Organization","Managing the Testing Process by Rex Black is a mess to read. Throughout the book the reader will find term definitions that are incomplete, circular or otherwise absent of substance. As a whole the book lacks focus and much organization. There are some good nuggets of information to be mined by the determined reader. However, I cannot recommend this book to any tester or testing manager."
5,Very comprehensive with concrete examples. Best testing book I have ever read!,"This is the best test management book that I have ever read. The author provides concrete examples and illustrations where appropirate so that the reader can actually learn, not just be awed by how smart he is. I especially appreciated the scope - the book covers the test process from beginning to end and includes helpful and practical advice on stuff that is frequently omitted from testing books like the politics of testing."
5,great book,"I saw this book in my public library, and after reading it once i figured out that i can't stay without it! so i decided to buy it, because you will always find a situation where this book can help you to plan testing processes or manage an existing process.Either if you are a software tester or a lead/manager this book can help a lot; highly reccomended!"
1,IT 645 College Book Review,"This book does not go well with the class, I would suggest to any university that is using this book for IT 645 class, to find a different author."
4,Good book - recommended for everyone who manages testing,"I very much liked the book. Rex Black has written about the process and management side of testing. This makes it an ideal complement to Cem Kaner's ""Testing Computer Software"" (which deals with testing technique) and Boris Beizer's ""Software Testing Techniques"" (which deals with the fundamentals).I found the templates useful, mostly because I never worked my way around Excel to get those metrics in an automated manner. But don't expect them to be replacement for commercial test management tools.This should be a required reading for anyone who plans or manages testing."
2,"Well written, but poor accompanying CD","I found this book well written, with an engaging style for what can be a very dull subject. Not exactly what I was looking for, but I was able to glean enough nuggets to gain some benefit.Very disappointed in the accompanying CD. Ad hoc samples appear to have been thrown together at the last minute. Simple things like a lack of data (1 record per sample database), poor data models, incorrectly documented comments and a lousy UI. Individual samples existed in a vacuum and did not tie together into a coherent whole. I would have held this book in higher regard if no CD had been included.It would appear that Rex Black did not practise what he preaches in this case - not a good look for a testing / QA publication."
2,"Good, but not great","As an aspiring tester, I can say that this book is not quite what I was looking for. It didn't give me a big picture of the testing process, nor did it give me any insight into how to use effective methods. On the whole, the better book for your money is ""Testing Computer Software"" by Kaner, et al. Now that one is a winner. This, just so so."
4,Rex Black explains clearly and deliberately,"My take on this book is that it`s more about creating organization within your test schedule and documentation. He goes through each step of the QA process, from documenting requirements to double-checking the results, and explains how you can spend hours upon hours of documentation for your QA efforts.It`s useful if you have nowhere to start. It`s full of new ideas if you already have a system in place. It can help you get more out of your testing organization if you have your QA manager read it for homework."
4,A good book,"It's always a great voyage to read or hear Borges. However, if you are not an Argentine, you'll miss a lot, since much of the interviews goes through very specific Argentine writers, politics etc."
4,Great saw - lousy stand,"I am overall very pleased with this product. Cuts well, nice features, packaging and instructions generated no complaints - for the saw.The stand was another story. It is tube steel construction, when I unpacked it, the tubes were dented and would not fit together without cleanup. It was not of the same quality as the saw."
5,Great Saw easy to use,The 788 is a great saw easy to use cuts good clean lines. I do fretwork and need to feed the blade in alot of drill holes top feed is great. a great saw at a great price.
3,cut great for an hour,"I saved all the money from the stuff that i cut on my old craftsman saw to upgrade to the dewalt, It took 8 days to receive. I put it together and started sawing, It was every thing it claimed to be for about an hour, then it started knocking, like the arm was hitting something. I called DEWalt and they said to send it back or take to service center. I drove 30 miles each way and they tell me it will take about a week and they will call me: I am not to happy with my new dewalt tool."
1,"Buy it, if you don't care if it runs","This saw did not operate out of the box. I took it into a Dewalt repair shop and they first replaced the speed control, which did not correct the problem. Then they replaced the printed circuit board and I had a working saw. Working for about one hour of use that is. The saw again does not have any speed control. You turn the saw ""on"" and whatever speed is present is what you get. Not looking forward to making continuous trips into Denver trying to get my monies worth out of this thing. Highly disatisfied. I thought DeWalt was above Black and Decker quality. I was wrong."
2,Topics are good...paper quality junk,"The information in this book is massive and very essential for any C programmer, that is if your eyes helped you enough to read it all .... because the paper and ink quality is worse than a newspaper."
4,Best Intermediate Book on C,"Bit expensive, but worth it. Gives you insight on topics you haven't thought of, in a clear manner. I especially enjoyed the topic on how c compiler calculates the memory location. But this is NOT for the experts. If you are already an expert, this book would be pretty much useless."
5,C Programming fun,"I saw this book first shortly after it came out and just had to have it. The DOS material is a bit dated, but still of interest. Chapter 4 on the similarities and differences between pointers and arrays is worth the price of the book alone. The material on function pointers in Chapter 8 is invaluable to an embedded systems programmer like myself. Great Software Humor is scattered throughout."
1,Low Printing Quality,"This book is printed so poorly that I cannot recommend it. The print-quality is lower than on-screen resolution from a computer screen.The bits of book I've read seem to blend being interesting and being unnecessarily caught up in arcania. I have never seen a technical book, pamphlet, paper, or journal that was so nearly illegible.Even the Forrest Mims books published by Radio Shack on low grade newsprint, and drawn with magic marker are more readable!This book should never have been published with a print quality so low."
5,Recommended!,"I liked this book, especially the way he comes up with funny phrases you don't see coming. I've read several other programming books (Safer C, Writing Solid Code, No Bugs!, etc), but this is definitely one of the ones that is enjoyable to read. It adds a light humour to the serious, useful information he provides.He goes into depth into the subjects of C declarations, memory, pointers, and arrays. He also explains some of the concepts behind the procedure activation record (used when calling a function), linking and compiling. He also challenges the reader with programming assignments to discover more, and provides programming advice."
4,A fine supplment to a C programmer's library.,"There are those times when reading for enjoyment is merited. van der Linden's conversational style allied with the wealth of topics he covers makes this a fun read. Much of the legend, lore and myths of the C language are explored. K&R explain ""how"" and PvdL tells you ""why"" and sometimes ""whodunit"". The drawback to this book is the sometimes extreme Sun-centricity, not surprising considering the author's employment. He's also had to revise his previous condescending remarks about the need to fetch a key (without a newline), dismissing it as only applicable for ""games programming.&quot"
5,Take me to School !!,"Peter's treatment of the C language is unique when compared to other texts I have read that attempt to cover the same material. His insight leaves the fingerprints of one who has written compilers. This lends itself to the kind of ""microsurgery"" that is performed on topics that other authors never get to. And Peter manages to do it while seasoning the prose with practical and historical byte sized treats. This book belongs on your shelf"
4,Excellent Book! Informative and fun,"For those looking to dig deeper into the nuances of the C language, this is an excellent book! It has given me a better understanding of C that is helping me design better C code. A must have!"
2,Not helpful,"I bought this book over a decade ago, in a rush to learn things that I needed. I recall it was a distinct waste of time. I'm no expert in C, so I needed tips. In the end, I favored other books that provided examples along with anecdotes. This book seemed to be much more focused on exhibiting how clever the author is, instead of actually helping me pull myself up by the bootstraps. The book I actually leaned on for advice (and I did write some code at the time) was Pointers on C by Kenneth Reek.Save your money, look for another resource."
4,Very Good,"This book was very informative and very well worded. I loved it. It tells everything that one needs to know in order to breed and raise ducks. This book helped me with every aspect that I needed to know about ducks in particular, and I would highly recommend it if you are planning to raise ducks or chickens in the near future."
1,poor craftsmanship,"i was really looking forward to receiving my new PINK espresso maker...if only i had known...i support taking advantage of shipping 'group' items however; had i known this item would not be in an individual box; i would have never ordered it. not only was it painted poorly and the paint chipped but, the handle was broken completely in half. needless to say; the espresso maker is unusable."
2,Bad Quality,"Ok, so I open up my package and I immediately notice chip paint falling off along the rim of the espresso maker. I am so disappointed because I purchased this to be a gift for a friend. I'm not about to give my best friend a chipped espresso maker. I didn't even bother to inspect anything else, I have no idea how good of an espresso maker it is."
2,too expensive to maintain,"I have been using the Jura Capresso for the past 3 years. The coffee has decent crema, but I am not happy with it's inability to make a very strong espresso. Setting the cup size is supposed to accomplish this, but the cup size is variable even when a single setting is maintained.My bigest gripe is that 2 years ago the machine malfunctioned and again this year. There is a flat fee of $275 to fix it including mailing (find your own box) which I find extremely excessive for a delicate machine that seems to break down every 2 years. The customer service person did confirm that this happens to a number of customers, but it is not excessive in the company's point of view. Also the turn around time to fix the machine is 3 weeks.I will switch to another product the next time it breaks down."
2,"Good coffee, weak espresso","The Jura-Compresso makes a decent cup of coffee but it is far from an espresso machine. I've been making venti size mochas (with 3 shots of espresso) for 15 years between my Starbuck's Barista and my Delongi machine. When I switched to the Jura I was very disappointed in the strength of the coffee. I also found the frother was terrible at frothing. I contacted Jura and they were very helpful in helping me but in conclusion the machine didn't perform as advertised. I returned it and purchased a DeLongi Magnific and I'm very happy. It makes excellent espresso shots and by using the ""mild"" setting, you can get an excellent cup of coffee. On one good note, Amazon was very helpful.Jura-Capresso 13204 Impressa E9 Automatic Coffee and Espresso Center"
2,Very poor at frothing,"I have owned cappuccino machines for about 25 years and all of them even at 1/10 this price could produce proper milk froth. (I know how to do it and use skim milk.) I have watched the DVD and called for customer support and practiced for weeks to no avail. The froth produced in either the ""up"" or ""down"" position of the frothing wand is too loose and bubbly like dish detergent bubbles not thick and creamy. Unfortunately, I have been trying for too long and having passed the 30 days cannot get a full refund. If you like a nice frothy cappuccino, try another brand."
2,Coffee very weak,Jura-Capresso 13204 Impressa E9 Automatic Coffee and Espresso CenterCannot get a good cup of coffee. Have tried all major brands but the coffee is still weak. Had to return for service after 6months. they replaced the grinder and brewer. Service was very fast and reps are very courteous and helpful.Would not buy an automatic again.
4,awesome so far!,"Great machine, makes great coffee so far. I have had it for two weeks and it rocks, fast easy and great tasting everytime... product shipped was different then product shown and a bit less fancy but all features are the same, just not as user friendly as the pictured product. I still think it is a great machine."
1,terrible sale,"I would recommend that Amazon cancel this seller's right to sell via Amazon.We paid for the product and thus filled our part of the deal, but never did receive our product. Emails and even phone calls were systematically ignored. We did finally get a response from the seller stating that he would refund our money that very day, yet that too was an empty promise. We finally had to take a legal approach.They may be great individuals - but they have no business selling products on the web."
5,Good summer Review,"I've been recommending this as a good workbook for my Spanish I students to review during the summer. They all say it is too easy, but I'm thrilled to know that they are looking at it. As they work through it, hopefully they'll be more challenged.It would be a useful tool for teachers in the public schools, and I would have used it when I taught in public school as bonus material for students who finished quizzes or other exercises early.The vocabulary is very basic for Spanish 1, and uses a good non-regional mix, meaning these are words that would be recognized in all Spanish speaking countries, not just Spain, and not just Mexico (some textbooks seem to lean one way or the other.)Great amount of material for the price, and because the answer key exists, an excellent self-study tool. I would say ages 7th grade and up would benefit from this book.Sra. GoseSpanish Teacher, AuthorFlip Flop Spanish Series"
4,Mark Wills never disappoints!!!,"Mark Wills comes up, again, with yet another solid CD! Out of the 11 tracks on the CD, there is only one I am not too keen about. This song is a duet with Ronnie Milsap called ""Prisoner Of The Highway"". I find it just doesn't fit in with the selection of other songs chosen for this CD. But 10 out of 11 songs I simply love. If you are a Mark Wills fan, this CD should NOT disappoint. From the beautiful ballads ""That's A Woman"", ""What She Sees In Me"", ""What Hurts The Most""....to the fun lyrics of ""Nothin' But A Suntan"", ""And The Crowd Goes Wild""....its well worth your money! Enjoy!"
2,This is funny,"I think that this album is funny.Plus the Song titles on Mark's album is really funny as well.I think by the time that I would be done listening to it, I will be in such laughter."
5,It's Fun (well it is for kids),"It's fun, so why not buy it? It's just $9.99. Your kids will really love it."
5,Bedime Blast Is Awesome,"I love the bedtime blast 20 piece accesorie set it comes with so many fun things the pets are so adorable and you can play with them for hours on end.It has 3 pets a chocolate lab, a cat,and an iguana they come with sleeping bag slippers and more i have like 150 pets and this one is one of my favorites!"
5,History lesson,Some how World War Two information is being set aside because of the time factor. This book was written in the 1940's. It provides a true picture of a small country fighting to stay free . Read it to understand history.
3,An Introductory Book,"This book doesn't help much those who have taken training on BW or who have been working on BW, as the book contains two chapters that may help you a bit on BW screens: one on Infocubes, the other on BEx. As put in title, the book covers more about planning: the part A about SAP in general, and 60 percent of Part B on SAP BW planning, etc.As an aside, I have no problems reading e-book bought here, but you should use the latest Adobe reader."
4,Excellent collection!,"I enjoyed both of these movies a lot.All the Right Moves -- classic Tom Cruise film about High School Football w/ Leia Thompson and Coach (TV Show I don't remember his real name).Great Expectations -- classic Charles Dickens novel turned into an R rated movie. I really enjoyed this movie, however I wish they had not used so much nasty language almost every other word out of Robert DeNiro's mouth was the ""f-word"" or ""sh**"". It would have been an AMAZING movie if they had left it out.I really enjoyed both movies. But who thought up this pairing? They have nothing to do with one another. But excellent pricing for two good movies! (at least used were)."
4,Excellent as usual!,"Another stellar performance by The Flower Kings. The only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars is that nothing can outperform their ""Space Revolver"" album (one of the best prog albums of all time). Standad jewel case edition."
3,incredibly week lyrics!,"Musically The Flower Kings have always been force to reckon with, blending the best elements of positive and upifting art rock into finely crafted masterpieces. The only problem is there lyrics, they could have been written by a child and they become more simplistic and unimagintive as there albums go on. To be brutely honest I think the lyrics STINK! I gave it 3 stars because of there musical talent and 0 stars for there lyrical in-ability. I really don't even see how some can call this album 'progressive'. Its doing someing that's been done over and over and its really getting redundent. Bands like this really should stop ripping of true progressive bands of there day like Yes, King Crimson, Frank Zappa, Rush and Genesis. Ronnie, try creating something original for a change!! I think that this album is a disappointment."
3,Less blessed,"One of modern progressive rock's more consistent groups, TFK's are able to achieve passing grades even on their lesser albums simply from an admirable desire to flesh out material- be it cheesy balladry or epic arrangement."
3,Dire - by previous standards,"Compared with earlier truly great TFK albums, I found this one sufficiently disappointing that I soon gave it away. The last song - Serious Dreamer was my favourite, although the Yes influences are worn VERY prominently on their sleeves here. The vocals - when not sung by Stolt - were a big turn-off...... Some songs sounded half-finished, like unnecessary filler to get the CD up to TFK's standard generous 70+ min length. If you're new to TFK,don't get this one first!"
2,Don't start with this CD,"If you have heard good things about The Flower Kings and you are looking to make a purchase, look elsewhere.Although this is their newest CD (at the time of the review), it is by far their weakest effort. While still good when compared to most other bands, the new listener would be well advised to start with ""Retropolis"" which in my opinion, is the most accessible.This CD is lacking the musical soul and strong lyrics of the band's previous efforts. There are a few good tracks but as a whole, I was left disappointed."
2,Slick styling but not built like old faithful.,"Had to retire my Skil worm drive after 11 years of faithfullservice. Liked the interesting design and the fact that it waslighter than old faithful but after about a month it was clear this was not a professional quality tool. Problems with the guard, and gears and a table that wouldn't stay locked. Almost impossible to find parts for this tool, rather heartbreaking when I had a box full of Skil parts right in the van. After the switch went out I gave up - returned it - and got a shiny new Skil HD77M, with the magnesium table. Just as light as the Black & Decker/Dewalt and not a single hiccup since I unwrapped it from the box. Wish every tool was built that tough."
1,didnt like it very much,first of this thing is all Plastic!!! second thing is balnce is weird and hard to get used to but the saw hook is a plus the main reason i rated this saw bad was it got droped off a plank that was no higher than five feet and craked in two and it wasnt even a week old so i geuss i will stay with a mag for now one star for the hook
4,Four Stars- Until It Broke,"This DeWalt saw has been excellent to me over the past 4+ years. It is comfortable, light in weight, powerful, and accurate. The rafter hook is great, and i've used this saw for cutting green wood, dried wood, engineered lumber, rebar, sheet metal, aluminum decking, stucco, and concrete. Recently while scoring a concrete slab, the gears gave out. While the shaft gear is in perfect condition, the armature gear is obliterated, and that happens to be the most expensive piece to replace as the gear is not available seperately from the armature."
2,Disappointing Durability,"Nice Saw and I've owned it for three years. Not a lot of use and it always performed well. I loaned it to a fellow I know well to build a dog house. When I get it back it acts like I need new brushes. Take it into service center and they say the armature has a burned spot. I don't think the guy that borrowed it abused it. Anyway DeWalt says $86 to repair it, still have to add tax to that.I can get another recon for $109 (free shipping and no tax) and that comes with a new saw warranty. Keep in mind also this saw has a current recall for safety problems. Maybe the Makita or Skill Mag would be a better choice. The Makta is the same price in a recon so maybe I'll give that a try. Since the Delta/Porter Cable accqusition more and more stuff is coming from China. I just don't think DeWalt is the same quality it used to be."
5,the best,"Dont buy anything but this saw. for balance to weight ratio-nothing better. I'm a framer and use this saw every day for thousands of cuts- The balance is so good I'll cut plywood on a ladder 20' in the air.I've cut through the cord three times, changed the bearings etc. the saw just keeps on going-not bad for a dewalt. Nothing else even compares."
2,"Don't pay, get it for free","This book is good. However, you don't have to pay for it. You can download the content of this book from MrSwing.com. And I mean the exact actual book with different name. This book was written to promote MrSwing's SwingTracker, and therefore should be given for free.I was very disapointed to pay for a book I already downloaded for free.In MrSwing.com this book is called ""A Practical Guide to Swing Trading"" by Larry Swing, who also wrote the forward for this book."
4,Boyfriend gets on my nerves,"I really liked her first 2 books in the series. And I really liked this one--but. I really wanted to know how sister Cat resolved tossing the parents from hell out of her house, and really really wanted the boyfriend to stop saying Sweethot. His ex-partner Milo is much more entertaining than Dutch, and I get tired of ""liar liar pants on fire"" for every instance of untruth in Abby's head. Otherwise, the mystery was tidy, and I liked the storyline. I will most likey buy the next book in the series, but it is not at the top of the list."
4,Entertaining!,"Enjoyed the previous mysteries as much as this one. Light but entertaining, I find myself addicted to Abby's adventures; I think you will too."
5,Won me over,"I was skeptical about this book. Not that I'm a skeptic by nature--in fact, I believe in intuition and psychic abilities. I was skeptical, however, that the author could make this type of trait in a protagonist work in a mystery without making it all seem a little too easy. But the author won me over and I tremendously enjoyed the book's highly original plot. The sister and parents didn't do much for me, but then again, I haven't read the first two books in the series, so maybe those characters are just there for continuity? At any rate, I highly recommend this book."
5,a vision of murder,"This installment is my favorite in the Psychic Eye series. It's a good, old fashioned haunted house mystery and also introduces us to M. J. Holliday of the new Ghost Hunter series. I enjoyed the depth added to Abby's relationships with Cat and Dutch. The supporting cast of characters is delightful and has followed Abby throughout the series."
3,Disappointed Fan,"I really enjoyed the first two Abby Cooper books (turned many of my friends on to them) and was looking forward to the third. However, in the latest in this series, the heroine has morphed into a ditzy woman who repetitively makes the same kind of stupid decisions, even when consequences should be teaching her otherwise. Do people sometimes act this way in real life? Sure, but I like my heroines to be smarter than average, especially when they are in an alternative profession. The real feel of Abby in the first two books was hard to find in this one. Please, Ms. Laurie, don't sacrifice Abby's strengths to create reasons for keeping her in crisis. The foundation of this series is so good that I'll keep reading it, to see if the Abby I like comes back."
3,WHERE IS THE CASE ?,"THE PRODUCT CAME, BUT NOT IN THE CASE, IT CAME ON THOSE HARD PLASTIC PACKAGES. SO, WHERE IS THE CASE ?"
3,"Good design, bad delivery","After a great deal of research, I decided the DW364 offered the best design (greatest adjustment flexibility, good power, sturdy materials, and best reviews of the top-rated saws) for a price that is within budget. However, my new, unused saw is at the Dewalt repair store having a few parts replaced. The saw I received couldn't be adjusted to make a 90 degree cut. After briefly reviewing the trouble, the repairman's first comment was (paraphrased): ""badly designed part; will have to replace it."" I also asked him to replace the shoe, which wasn't flat. Everything else looked OK. All of my other Dewalt tools worked correctly out-of-the-box. I hope to have a great saw after the repairs. Why should a new saw need repairs?"
5,Best circular saw out there...,"I bought another one of these to replace one that was stolen. It's bulletproof, dead accurate, and really really hard to break."
2,Buying a new circular saw?,"Don't buy the DeWalt 7 1/4"". I bought my first new skill saw in 10 years. Previously I have had great luck with Makita Tools. In an emergency, I picked up the DeWalt and took it to work. At first I loved it. Comfortable, light and accurate. But within a few hours of cutting 2x lumber, it soon went out of true. Then the shoe started to warp. I have not been able to get an accurate cut since. I am returning it and going to stick with my Makitas. I have six Makitas. Three 7 1/4"", one 8 1/4"", and a 10 "" chop saw, and a new 10"" compound slide miter which I love! I highly recommend all Makita tools. Also a guy on my crew has a Porter Cable 71/4"" saw that has held up well and the shoe has a life time guarantee."
4,Nervous 'bout all the time,"This movie was recommended by Marshall Chapman at a performance/reading last year. She told the audience that one of her favorite lines in the movie was John Prine's, ""I'm nervous 'bout all the time.""Take it from someone who grew up in the South and knows people like the characters in Daddy and Them...the dialogue is right on. I found it particularly refreshing that the Southern accents weren't overdone. Andy Griffith is perfect as Daddy and Laura Dern, Kelly Preston and the rest of the cast do a great job, as well.See this if you like off beat movies that don't move too fast and appreciate a good laugh out loud."
4,a finely crafted southern movie,"I had been wondering if this would ever be released,and thankfully it happened.I don't know how Billy Bob Thorton assembled this great cast, but it was quite a feat to have this many greats on a picture.John Prine was a real treat in his first acting debut, and It's the last wink from Jim Varney you'll get to see.This picture is a hilarious look at things southern that will make you take note of simpler places in life and re-acess whats important in our everyday worlds."
1,"if i knew this movie had as much cussing in it,and so nasty.i wouldn't had ordered it.it's very nasty.","this movie is nasty,cussing i didn't care for it.it sure wasn't worth no money in my opinion.i liked billy bob thronton in sling blade but this was not his best at all."
1,"WORST of Billy Bob,","Believe me, I wanted to like this movie - my expectations were sky high.This, the follow-up to my all time favorite film, Sling Blade, that almost never saw the light of day.After suffering through ""Daddy and Them,"" I understand why.I really would have rather never even seen it. That's just how horrible it is.I guess even a Southern Gothic genius can phone it in, and that is just what I feel that Billy Bob Thornton did in ""Daddy and Them.""I was saddened and thoroughly disappointed in this waste of time, talent and film. MMMM HMMM."
1,"Havn't seen it, like the music","I guess I'm a little late, but what the hell. A few days ago I came across a video tape in an old box. A John Prine special on PBS. Pretty good. Prine talked about the movie,(and the soundtrack of course) in an interveiw, and I remember wondering what happened to it. Anyway, the movie might be good or bad, but the music is worth a listen. I'm not a big country music fan, but Prines' stuff is smart and funny."
2,Sorry I bought it,"I got this, because I liked the song John Prine and Iris Dement sang that is supposedly the high point of the movie. Naturally, I guess, it comes at the end. I couldn't stand watching the move long enough to get there. Even though I grew up in the deep South a long time ago, nobody I knew behaved the way the Southerners in the move were portrayed. Maybe they were depicting the modern South Arkansas style. If so, thank goodness I moved to New Mexico. The only reason I gave it two stars is that Andy Griffith was in it. Just his presence uplifted the lameness just a little. Otherwise, I wish I had my money back."
4,"If you are no more than a little bit country, you will enjoy this movie","Every role was well cast in this movie. It really doesn't matter that the script was a little over the top, this movie is fun entertainment. Get your snaks from the kitchen, kick back and enjoy the film, and please clean up any leftovers before you leave the living room."
4,A little smile..,I purchased this video as a gift for someone who likes BillyBob's work-- and they were not disappointed! A good deal for the price!
2,Not great,Just over all not a good movie. I bought it because John Prine was in it and Billy Bob Thornton. It just wasn't entertaining.
3,Not bad,I saw the end of this movie on TV and wanted to see the rest. It's got some really funny moments and over all is a pretty entertaining movie. I'm a big Billy Bob fan so that helps too. But I'd say it's worth watching.
4,Ignore the 1-star review,"I just had to respond to the first review, which gave one star to this marvellous album. The reviewer is simply saying that he does not like this kind of music: contempory traditionally oriented folk music from the north of England. Kathryn Tickell has been responsible possibly more than any other piper for returning this kind of music to a fairly sizeable audience and she has done it without dumbing down or sweetening up the music. I saw her perform this material with the above Ensemble Mystical in England a couple of years ago in a medieval Great Hall in Devon, England and it was magnificent; the cd accurately captures the music and for any lover of traditional English or Celtic music it (along with her other recordings) is essential for an overview of the state of the tradition today."

5,dewalt 788 scroll saw stand,"WOW !! ordered this and Amazon said 7 days. Only two days later here she comes. Impressive. more after I get the saw and how it all works.Got to open the box and put the table together today. Box was a little beat up, but each piece was wrapped in plastic. Very pleased with the quality and wrapping. No directions to speak of, but was very easy to look at the picture and even supplied a few extra nuts and bolts. recommend this stand with no reservations at all."
5,Great,"After reading the reviews on this stand I was a little worried about ordering it. But, ordered it anyway. Glad I did. Box arrived with no damage. All parts were there. Very easy to put together. All you need is a 1/2"" socket and some common sense. Make sure to follow the directions and put the saw on the stand before you tighten everything up. The Dewalt Dw788 saw and the DW7880 stand are a great combo!"
5,Great Stand,I ordered the recondioned model and I am very happy. I received the item in less than a week. It went together like a charm. It only took 1 hour to put together and to mount the scrollsaw.
4,A Stand is a Stand.,"What can you say about a stand? It went together easily enough and accomodates my 788 just fine. The legs have a lip on them to allow the stand to be anchored into the floor, however I was not about to ramset a scroll saw into my concrete shop floor. Or, maybe those holes are for wheels, hmmmmm. If you need a stand for your saw, get it."
2,"Looks cool, seems solid but a real pain to assemble!","I have never understood how any manufacturer who creates products for buyer assembly have never ever tried to assemble their own products! I'd love to give the CEO, Board of Directors and their Design Teams their own individual Scroll Stand Saws to assemble! I am certain that the product would be redesigned within hours and it would then be a snap(hint,hint)to quickly assemble and then bolt together!"
5,SCROLL SAW STAND,A REAL STURDY STAND FOR HOLDING THE DE WALT 788 SCROLL SAW. A GREAT FIT. THE BLACK COLOR REALLY ACCENTS THE SAW'S COLORS.
5,great item,using this stand helps out a great deal. it bolts right up easy to move around when you need to. fast shipping too. a must to go with the saw.
5,Test of Time,"As a self-employed piano teacher, I have used Dome 600 weekly bookkeeping record for the past 22 years. Since I can no longer purchase it locally, I order it annually online. I have never found a comparable substitute. Dome 600 has stood the test of time for me."
2,At least it was short,"Staring at the Sun read rather as if Barnes had a couple of good ideas rattling around his head, but hadn't the time to explore or refine them before the publishing deadline was up.I wish I'd given up fairly early on, when it was clear that the main character was not someone I could engage with or care about. Then about two thirds into the book, it just got silly. Still I persevered - partly because I'd loved the History of the World in Ten and a Half Chapters & Flaubert's Parrot, partly because this book had been recommended.Very disappointing."
3,Not Vintage Barnes,"The first two thirds are the biography of an English woman who leads a drab monotonous life. She has a brief friendship during World War II with a fighter pilot who has mildly mystical tendencies (a la Antoine de St Exupery) marries a policeman, leaves him and has a child. I suspected (having read Flaubert's Parrot) that Barnes was setting out to rival Flaubert's ""Un Coeur Simple"" by showing us that an account of a drab monotonous life could be interesting. She eventually acquires a little sophistication and money and does some traveling and becomes philosophical. The last section switches into science fiction by having her survive into a dystopic twenty-first century.It lacked the bite and wit and penetrating insights of vintage Barnes. The futurology was unoriginal by science fiction standards - I don't think it would have made it into publication in Asimov's.- and the mysticism was run-of-the-mill.Not up to Barnes's standard, but that's a very high standard."
3,Not One of his Better Ones,"I am a Julian Barnes fan and was rather disappointed at this early effort. His writing is as precise as ever and his wit is there. But somehow the story line following a naive woman protagonist from childhood to age 100 somehow never gets going. There are interesting side characters, true, but the heroine and her listless and lost son do not spark any empathy or understanding but mostly annoyance at their passiveness. The story does get better as it goes along, but it's not enough to rescue the book."
2,Not for the ophiophobic!!!,"William Katt and Shanna Reed star in this silly little thriller about a town being terrorized... by rattlesnakes!Apparently the rattlesnakes are disturbed by the dynamiting at a nearby hillside. The final confrontation will leave some viewers gasping, not for the ophiophobic!!!Average acting, nothing much of a story."
4,great flip flop,"These shoes are great flip flops. They are comfortable, durable, and reasonably priced (considering they can double as walking/hiking shoes.) No break in period, but they are comfortable and ready to rock from the first use. This style is light and more comfortable than other Chaco flips I've purchased in the past. Definitely recommend."
2,These did not live up to the hype,"I have heard from friends that these are the most comfortable flip flops on the market and that they are good for walking. I have repeatedly tried to wear them and I find them to be painfully uncomfortable to the point that even wearing them to run out to get the paper is unpleasant. I believe that these shoes are made for people with arches, but I have very flat feet so it feels like something hard is pressing up against the bottom of my foot.I am giving the shoe 2 stars rather than 1 because I have heard so many good things from others."
1,BUYER BEWARE.,"These shoes are either made for people with tiny feet or they just run really really narrow and short. I have wide feet and wear most Medium width and a few Wide width footwear but this was way too narrow and short on my feet. Also, these are VERY HARD soled. No cushioning whatsoever. A let-down for me since they came so well-recommended (see other reviews). They didn't come cheap so I'll have to resell or gift these at some point. Disappointing :-("
5,Best Flip Flop ever made,This was my third pair of Chaco flip flops. Cheap flat flip flops make my feet hurt. Wearing these well supported flip flops make a huge different. I wear these all year long. Right after work each day I put these on in my car and wear them until I go to sleep.
5,Great for everyday wear!,"I love shoes. I like high heels, I like patent leather, I don't typically get excited about a flip flop. However, this one is the exception. While it doesn't exactly add much to any of my outfits, it is super comfortable and works well for my early, early morning swims and trips to the farmers market. I got the solid black pair and I find that I have them on just about every day at some point. While they are a bit expensive for a flop, I think they are going to prove well worth the money. This shoe is well constructed and feels like it has the heft to last through quite a few summers. I especially like the contour of it...it's not flat like a typical flip flop and it so comfortable on the foot! Also, I found it was very true to size....I go back and forth between an 8 1/2 and a 9 depending on the shoe. I ordered the 9 and it fits perfectly."
4,Great arch support,I like the arch support. I normally wear orthotics in my shoes and was frustrated that flip-flops didn't offer sufficient support. My only complaint is that my feet are wide and there is no stretch to the straps.
3,Loose Straps,Chaco flips are my favorite. But this pair for some reason had really loose straps and didn't fit very well at all. I had to return them.
3,Decent,"This eraser works well but after about six months it no longer would hold a charge, NONE at all so I have to use it plugged in which kinda defeats the purpose of a cordless eraser. Also using it while plugged in the unit gets very warm. Battery does not appear to be replaceable. They have decent reputations maybe I just got unlucky. If you do a lot of drawing or drafting definitely get one, and spend the money. Something like the Sakaura battery operated model for apporx. $30 is a real waste of money."
2,Disappointment,I am very disappointed with the Staedtler cordless eraser. I had an Alvin that was 7 years old and also cordless and worked much better. The Staedtler is make a strong eraser if you do much erarsing or drafting and design for a living. I would not recommend it.Pat
2,poor quality,"For this manufacturer, I expected higher quality. This eraser lasted less than one year."
2,Do Not Buy Rechargable Stuff,"After about a year the thing won't hold a charge, and the batteries are not replaceable. I would get the corded model instead. When it works, it erases just fine. Fortunately, you can plug it in and bypass the batteries, but when you do that the thing spins like mad; too fast for normal use."
4,Coming to terms with Kashmiri culture,"This novel is a most enjoyable story, an adult story, about a widow with young children learning to live in an alien, not always friendly place, a remote village in Kashmir, in the 1950s. It shows great understanding of the villagers, the children, and Sophie herself, headstrong, risking her own and her daughter's life because of her faith in other people, never giving up that faith. More than any other quality, it has enormous charm"
5,Enjoyed the book from beginning to end.,"Was sad when the book finished, Rumer Golden is a wonderful storyteller. I felt as though I were in Kashmir with her. Recommend this book, Black Narcissus, and The River. Also the old movie, THE RIVER is worth renting or buying. It's one worth seeing every few years."
3,"Good, But Unnecessary for Most Readers","Oran and Tosti do a nice job of defining legal terms for the nonlawyer. As a professional who needs to understand legal terminology, however, I have found this book unnecessary. I bought ""Law Dictionary for Nonlawyers"" before I acquired ""Black's Law Dictionary."" The latter is so complete and has such clear definitions that I rarely even bother to use ""Law Dictionary for Nonlawyers.""I strongly recommend that the layman buy and use ""Black's Law Dictionary,"" rather than this or other legal dictionaries designed for laypersons."
2,Law Dictionary for Non-Lawyers,"Unfortunately, this book was too basic and left a lot to be desired. I've seen better and have better from other sources. I was disappointed because I've been around the legal profession for several years as a (non-attorney) advocate with legal training from university law professors. I specialize in administrative litigation and this book was no help to me."
5,well worth reading,"I am an Armenian Evangelical woman who enjoys reading of church histories and personal testimonies of fellow believers. This book is a thoroughly detailed and fascinating account of a great evangelical who maintained his faith despite the loss of his martyed father and 75 other relatives during the incomprehensible, yet very real massacres of the Armenian people by the Turkish Muslim government during 1898-1922. Reverend Krikorian points out in his writings that the Muslim religion allowed those to be spared, should those convert to Mohamadism. Still, millions of Armenians refused, and were martyred for their faith.Reverend Krikorian was a survivor of this ordeal, yet instead of turning from his faith, he embraced it as a Pastor in America and missionary to those left in Armenia who survived.This book is fascinating, thorough in detail and a must read for those who identify as either a Christian or Armenian."
2,Not enough audio inputs,"The problem with this system is it only had 2 audio inputs. I could hook up my DVD and VCR, but not my new HDTV or any other components, such as a CD player or iPod. There are several other Home Theaters of similar quality and price that have 5 or more audio inputs."
3,Random squeals and buzzing using digital input,"This system sounds great and is easy to set up. I would give it 5 stars if it worked 100% of the time.However, my first one has squeals and buzzing happening at random times when using the digital audio input (both coaxial and RCA). There have been multiple reports of this on cnet's user reviews as well. It doesn't happen on every system, but when it does, you'll know it. I'll be returning the system today. I'll try one more time, but if the second one doesn't work, I'll go with Sony's equivalent even though it has one less digital audio input."
2,shop vac,I bought this thinking yes it is expensive but appears built to last. I also thought for the money it should suck the paint right off the wall when I start it up. To my surprise I found out it can not suck up a lousy screw on the floor. It is very quiet and filter is great. It is a VERY large unit. All I know is my craftsman would out suck this machine. I am planning on sending this unit back unless Dewalt tells me there is something wrong with it?? In the long run I think you are better off going to Lowes or Depot and getting a $ unit.
1,Some outdated information,"The book seems to have some very outdated views in dog training and communication. Like that part where it stated we need to assert our dominance by not letting Staffies sleep with us. That ""dominance theory"" has no support within the scientific community. Also I have several Staffies and never had any problems with any of them sleeping in my bed. And I never felt i had to ""assert"" myself with some strange rituals like feeding myself first or stuff like that."
3,Mixed review with inkjet printer,"I purchased these envelopes for use in an HP OfficeJet. They worked fine if I only printed an outgoing address. However, I wanted to print a return address in the upper left corner, and this caused lots of problems -- type lines askew, wrinkled envelopes, and paper jams. Apparently the printer cannot feed envelopes well if you want to print near the top corner. This may be a failing of the printer more than a failing of the envelope itself. The paper quality of the envelopes is good."
3,"So,so",Just seems like an average book on whitetail hunting. If your new to hunting buy this if not doing waste your money
3,ok,Pretty generic wisdom here. Get DDH and you can read the same advice over and over for 12 months. Nothing new for novices or old pros.
4,"Yet again a Great! Album,, from putumaya","If you want an album that,s fresh and cool to listen or dance to then this is the album you should have!!"
5,Best Akita Book EVER!!!,"This is, without a doubt, the best book on the Akita Breed ever written! Contains comprhensive chapters on topics such as Nutrition, Training, Health, Dog Shows, How to Find a Breeder, History and more. If you buy only one book on the breed make it this one! We are so fortunate to have this book. I can't imagine being without it. Kudos to the author-I imagine all breeds need someone like this! The price is actually laughable, considering what you are getting. Worth many times the current asking price. DogsRbetter, and if yours happens to be an Akita-you really want this book!"
4,Akita book review,"This book was a gift for my brother who is going to buy an Akita so I really can't write much about it, but he informed that it is a very good book and will be helpful to him buying and owning an Akita."
1,Bad book,"This was the worse book I have ever read concerning issues important to a dog owner. All the ""Junk"" that was included just caused the book to be bigger. My advise "" Buy a comic book"""
2,Fair; but better to see art by Bouguereau,"Book is big but only fair. A lot of text -- somewhat interesting, but not profoundly so. The photos -- none are really titillating, if that's what you're after. The best art -- clothed or nude -- of this type is Bougeureau. See books (there are only a couple) about him. (I reviewed one.) Waterhouse is also good. But Waterhouse's women always have the same androgonous hard unfriendly faces. Bouguereau has more variety than Waterhouse very pretty faces as well as other parts. Even if all you want are titillating nudes, you are more likely to find it with Bouguereau than in this book. If lots of mood, but unpleasant faces is OK, Waterhouse gives you plenty of mood. Bouguereau also gives mood but in a greater variety. And all his body parts are beautifully rendered. If you want lots and lots of text, this book is fine. But even the text about Bouguereau is more profound than what is here."
4,Totally adequate,"They seem to be holding up well. They're a pretty tight fit on my orbital, so I can't use a levelling pad underneath, but they work fine for waxing the car.And a year later, I'm ordering another set. I haven't had one fall apart yet, but if you take it off the surface you're working with the orbital still spinning, it will fling off into the bushes. I will also be ordering a set of microfiber bonnets, as these are not ideal for putting on a fine finish. Tip: take a sharpie and write on the inside of the bonnet exactly what compound you used last time. You can go from a wax to a polishing compound, but once you put polishing compound on it, that's all it's good for."
2,not worth the money,Really bad at removing wax. Would not buy again. I think you could do much better with microfiber. Hold out for a better product.
3,"""Great bonnets""",I chose this rating because this is a top of the line product! I loved the way these bonnets worked! I would highly recomend this product to anyone!
2,"""Daily Prayer Book"" Kessinger Reprint","The Kessinger reprint of ""Daily Prayer Book"" by Birnbaum has high quality paper, sturdy binding and covers with a clear dark print. However, there is one major problem. This is a Hebrew book that should be printed to read from the right cover to the left cover (the reverse of English). Kessinger printed the book to read from left cover to right as an English book. This makes the book unusable as a Hebrew prayer book. I had to return the purchase. I wrote to Kessinger but have not received a reply."
4,"Excelltent, but more needed","This disk pays tribute to the early days of Rock 'n Roll. It is a nice start, but some of the tracks are all to avalible elsewhere and it would be nice to see some more rare tracks by the artists included on the disk. Mead & Ginsberg talking about the Beat Generation is classic conversation. The CD is a much needed relief from an age where the top music stars are overproduced supermodels, and good looking pretty boys who cannot play an instrument much less write one of their songs.Before the age of MTV, when pop stars had to look good, there was the golden age of Rock radio, and this disk is a reminder that there was a time when the focus was on the music, not the glitter."
1,Problems from the very beginning,"I don't usually bother to write these things because I'm don't expect much from products made today. They usually work for a while and then break and I go on. But I have had nothing but issues with this package since I purchased it for the office. The problem is that for no known reason, while typing in WORD and using the foot pedal, the audio file that I am transcribing suddenly jumps back to start. It happens randomly and without apparent cause. I spent hours on the phone with customer service (who were very, very friendly, if not always knowledgeable)only to have a product that makes me so angry I usually just give up. I've even upgraded to the most recent software package and changed the setting as per instructed to help resolve the issue, but it continues. I've tried it on different computers and with different staff members. We do not have this issue with our Olympus digital transcribing kit."
2,Completely confused,"When I bought the product I had high hopes for what it would do. I am master's student trying to transcribe my interviews for my thesis. I wanted a product to take my recorder interviews and turn them into written word. This software does not do that. All the software does is allow for you speed up, stop and rewind a recording with your foot. This foot pedal somewhat eases the process but if you did not use a Sony IC recorder the software will not read anything that is not a .wav file. My recorder of course saves the audio files as .wma. So I then had to download conversion software!! The headphones provided with the software and foot pedal are of poor quality especially for the price the product costs. I ended up having to combine the transcription software with Dragon Naturally Speaking to transcribe my interview. It has been a big hassle. I would not recommend this item for if you are expecting a faster and more efficient process."
2,So Far Not So Good...,"This product is great in theory, but so far I haven't been able to use it. It does not appear to be compatible with my Sony ICD-UX71 digital voice recorder. It might have been nice if someone had told me that before I bought the thing. Inside the box, in tiny letters, it says the transcription system is only compatible with ICD-ST, SX, MS, BM, BP and P series Sony recorders. So now I guess I have to spring for a new recorder as well. The system looks simple enough if you have a compatible recorder. The foot pedal plugs right into your computer. I'm looking forward to seeing how well it works with Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition software."
3,Foot pedal,"The pedal does stick, but I find it helpful and am happy to have it now that it came down in price. I have to type lengthy Meeting Minutes and this was necessary."
1,Software doesn't work,"The software was burned onto a blank disc and it seemed to install just fine, but when ever I try to load the program, it freezes up and says ""Not Responding"". Feels like a waste of money."
4,Very clear and easy to use,"I am very pleased with this product. It installed easily, and the clarity through the headphones is above average. The software is flexible and easy to use. Overall, this set does exactly what I needed and I would recommend it to anyone who needs good digital transcription equipment and software."
3,Different than I expected,"I purchased this product for two reasons. First, that the product is organic. Second, that sweet potatoes were out of season. So, for those reasons, this is a great product. However, I felt the puree was really liquidy. I assumed it would be more like pumpkin puree. Having a soft, solid texture. Also, it has a little twang after-taste. I felt the butternut squash puree had a similar after-taste. I was not familar with this type of puree product. I had always used Libby's canned pumpkin puree or homemade puree. So, it is possible it was simply my expections due to product comparison. It did make excellent sweet potato pies, but I was not happy with the other recipes."
1,"Tart taste, this is not sweet potatoes!!","I thought that this would actually be ""sweet"" given that it is suppose to be ""sweet"" potatoes but it is bitter like ear wax!! Never again! I have 10 cans left...what will i do with them!?"
5,Fine product,All the cans were well packaged and there was no damange to any of the cans I received. I feed pumpkin to my dog occassionaly and she likes this pumpkin very much.
4,I want to buy a beekeeping starter kit now!,"This is an interesting documentary very similar to ""Food Inc"", and ""Inconvenient Truth"". So, right of the bat you know who the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" are. The movie presents evidence that pesticides are the root causes for bees vanishing.So, watch this with a grain of salt, and you will enjoy it. I enjoy it so much that I think I will try beekeeping as a hobby."
5,"Broan QT242WW 42"" Under Cabinet Range Hood","We purchased this to replace an old, very noisy, Ventline range hood. The Broan was easy to install; fan is very quiet and has multiple speeds ranging from very low to very high that work well at eliminating cooking odors from inside the house; the light has a low and high setting (2 A-15 appliance lamps not included) and provides plenty of light for cooking. We would highly recommend this to anyone wishing to replace their old noisy range hood with a new quiet model!"
3,"Somewhat cheap, would get quieter and stronger next time",Got this as a replacement for the original I had in my home. It is OK but noisy at higher speeds. For the price it works out.
4,Range Hood,"Very good product, and the price was terrific! My total price was about $80 less than I would have paid for the identical item at Sears (if one includes sales tax).The item is sleek and attractive looking, and performs well. It's not noisy, although it's not ""super quiet"" either. I connected it to a rectangular vent, and had to be careful that the cutout for a cirular vent ddn't come out as well.All in all, an excellent purchase."
1,really hard to read and understand,"It is an old scripture, translated into english. I could not understand most of the text."
1,Not even close...,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read - it is ridiculously bad. The content is at best common sense and at worst completely inane. The layout follows no discernable logic. The graphics make no sense, or at least no point (other than filling space). And the format appears to be the work of someone unfamiliar with the most basic word processing program - bullets out of order, indentation that muddies the content. Hiles needs to establish a service level agreement with his editor.For the price, I expect a book that is not only informative, but professionally designed and edited. Instead I get the ramblings of a self-styled expert in service level agreements. In the end, the book is a joke...and Hiles is laughing all the way to the bank at $125 each."
4,The Best DeWalt Circular Saw ever made!,"While it being an impressive claim considering the quality of DeWalt portable tools, the DW364 is still a far cry from the Super Sawcat of the late to early 90's.The DW364 was the first Dewalt (of the yellow variety) circular saw that featured an electric brake. It's strong shoe/base coupled with a strong knob/depth adjuster makes this as solid a saw out in the market. Blade changing is practical with the blade lock feature. Easy motor brush access, makes this saw very easy to self-service.Good saw that has only proven itself"
5,saw,"i love the way it feels and works, and will buy more Dewalt products. great price and will tell all my friends"
1,Mrs. Lehr should be ashamed!,"The story that the author tried to convey in this autobiography, one of being trapped in a loveless marriage to a homosexual, is marred by the author's haughty social-climbing and snobbishness, as well as the numerous racist comments in the book. I found it offensive that a supposedly well-bred woman such as Elizabeth Drexel Lehr would lower herself by openly denegrating other people."
2,Missed the Mark,"I really wanted to like this book. And I did find a lot of value, but it seemed more like a handbook you would get when attending a seminar to accompany the presentation. Perhaps that is what the authors intend."
3,Good generalization,"In this simplistic, straight-forward account of the most famous of all medieval pastimes, Jeffreys explains the origins of the tourney as a barbaric free-for-all, its evolution into a highly stylized sport for the very rich, and its ties with the ever-present warfare of the Middle Ages. One-hundred pages is hardly enough space to allow an author to go into any depth at all, and one does get the idea that Jeffreys is just skimming the surface of his subject matter. Still, it is a good general look at the medieval tournament."
1,Didn't work for me,"Mixed as directed on label 1 and 1/3 oz per gal of water to use in hand spray bottle to spray my carpets/floors. It seemed to work for about 3 hrs, then the fleas are eating me up again in every room I sprayed and dog hasn't been outside to bring more in yet. Seems it just put the fleas to sleep for a few hours and that was it. They're just as bad as before I sprayed. $25 down the drain."
2,Buy a Separate Light Stand vs. This One,"Overall, this is an ""ok"" light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this. The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the ""up and over"" position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work. That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects, and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."
2,"Defective bulb, but otherwise OK","Easily attached and a useful addition. Unfortunately, the light bulb was defective and I was unable to get a replacement or a refund for the bulb I had to purchase. I could, of course, return the entire device, but why for just a single $5.00 light bulb?"
1,work light trouble,"I found this light to be nearly worthless, it doesn't stay where you put it and keeps falling down so that within one week of having it and constantly adjusting it one of the mounting screws stripped out of the Dewalt saw."
2,A weak light,This light leaves a lot to be desired. The neck needs to be stiffer so it doesn't droop and the power needs to be increased for a stronger bulb. The amount of light provided by this lamp is weak.
3,Wrong replacement bulb specified,My light has worked out fine. But my work light says to use a candelabra base bulb as a replacement. The correct bulb is a 25 watt R-14 flood with an INTERMEDIATE base. Once I knew that the replacement bulb was easy to find.
1,Poor designed product,The light would not stay in place as it is not strong enough to stay in a fixed position. I had to use string to hold it upright so that the light would show on the work. Very poor design and would not recommend anybody purchase it.
3,product is as advertised.,its simple and works well. the tube holding up the light has trouble handling the weight of CFL bulbs. It does not stay where you put it and sags. Thanks nancy for getting rid of old filament light bulbs. It is great having toxic mercury bulbs in work shops where they get broken alot. It really isnt safe putting CFL bulbs in this product due to mercury poisoning. I have not found an LED that fits the narrow opening yet. The bulb weight is an issue for the tube holding the light fixture. My old filament bulbs have no trouble but you cant get high watt bulbs anymore.I recommend DEWALT stiffen up this product given CFL type bulbs will only be availlable in the future. It simply cant handle the weight of the CFL bulbs.
4,Good dance CD,If yer into Dance music this is a good solid CD. Most of the songs are pretty popular and I had them on most of my other CDs but still this is a great compilation. From Dj Quicksilvers's Ameno to Neils Van Gogh's Electronic confusion you really can't go wrong with this CD! Plus it's not a continous mix so if you wanna grab songs off of it to make yer own compilation it works great.
4,Emotionally Compelling,"This book is masterfully written, and it is clear why it has won the Newberry Award. Although the overarching theme is predictable, the twists and turns that the plot takes to reach the conclusion are surprising and interesting. I couldn't put this book down."
3,Better for adults,"Getting Near to Baby is a good book, and it is well written. While the novel has strong voices, I just felt that the voice of the protagonist was much too adult for a 12 year old. Her didactic philosophical musings were not how a child would process the world, thereby making the story lose some punch for me. Her actions seem real (someone complained that it was dumb for a kid to climb onto a roof, but that is exactly the kind of thing a kid would do) but the general thought processes whenever there was no dialogue were not realistic to me. Good book, but really an adult writing for adults."
3,A Good Realistic Book,"I thought Getting Near to Baby was a pretty good book. I liked it because the book has all sorts of different moods taking place. I also thought it was good because it was based on different life experiences that the author had. I learned how hard it is to have a young member of the family die. I would recommend this book to more girls than boys because it is told as a girl's experience. To see what the sad problem is and what an enjoyable ending it has, read Getting Near to Baby to find out."
3,A Sad Book,"A young girl, Willa Jo, had a baby sister who died. The death created a deep sadness in her entire family, so deep that Willa Jo stopped talking. People around her tried to help, but nothing seemed to work. There were beautiful passages in the book where Willa Jo would climb onto a roof and look up at the sky, as if the sky could soothe her pain and help her reach out to her sister. Heaven always seems to be above us, in the evening or nighttime sky, and that must have been where the baby had gone. I recommend this book because parts of it reminded me of when my own grandma died. I understood how sad Willa Jo must have felt, which is good writing. How the family grieved and handled the loss was never boring. It makes the reader think about their families, death, sadness, and how life must always go on."
1,"Too sentimental, essentially meaningless","This book, about a family torn apart by a baby's death in the Depression is frankly, depressing. The entire book takes place on a rooftop with flashbacks making up most of the content. There is no particular reason to be on the roof it justs ""feels like the right place to be"" or something of the like. And in an attempt to be very profound the author attributes the cause of their rooftop venture as the family's way of ""getting near to baby."" Yes, that is the whole point of the novel. The exciting climax where the family actually talks on the roof is heartpounding and turbulent. If you can't detect my sarcasm by now, you are not educated enough to read this book. Well honestly this book is to touchy-feely, if that were ever thought possible and has no conflict or plot whatsoever. The moral learned from reading this is not to ever read a book by someone who lists their hobby as ""making stone walls."""
3,Getting Near to Baby,"This book opens a path to its readers that is unexplainable. The Newbery honor book bears a truth that not many people want to hear. Getting Near to Baby is written by Audrey Couloumbis, and is not in a series.Getting Near to Baby is about a family that not only falls apart because of their baby sister's death, but is torn apart by their misunderstanding aunt. The only thing that they find comfort in is the sunrise (they believe it is their sister in heaven.) The family has to go through some rough times, but is still willing to make it work. Can they possibly get along?I thought that this book was excellent and in many ways a teaching tool. I would rate this book a three out of five. This book starts out slow, but ends too quickly. I could not put it down after fifty or more pages. When finished with this book, you too will see the blinding sunrise!"
4,A Wonderful Book!,"Getting Near to Baby definitely deserves 4 stars! The writing style Audrey Coulumbis shows is interesting. She is a very poetic writer and I will definitely read her other books. If you love poetry you will like this book.While a little bumpy and dreamy at the beginning, overall it is a great book. The chapters are very short but include much detail. This book satisfys readers young and old. The characters are very intriguing, and make any reader want to read more. Willa Jo and her family seem like normal people, but I don't know anybody who sits on a roof to watch the sunset. The plot of the book is twisted and sad, unlike most books I have read. It was sad how the aunt treats the children. Doesn't it seem mean not to let children play with children across the street because they live in little houses? Even though this book is sad, I will recommend it to everyone in search of a great book! By: Caitlin"
4,good popper,"This is a fun product. I would have given it five stars, but it came with a stopper missing on the crank and my Dad (Who I gave it to as a gift) had to fix it himself. I own one myself and I love making sugar popcorn in it. I like that it makes popcorn quickly without the additives in microwave popcorn."
5,It Met All the Great Reviews,"I was a little concerned that the Whiley-Pop might be a hassle to use and would end up stored with the fondue, assorted blenders, choppers, magic egg or bullet, etc. But it wasn't! It works as well as described and is very easy to clean and store. We use it a lot so I'm pleased with my decision to purchase it.Popcorn does not burn (unless you walk away from it(DAMHIK), I find that less expensive popcorn pops just as well as some of the brands that cost 3 times as much.When it arrived I was a little put off by the thinness of the pot but after using it realized it let the heat spread quickly and evenly across the bottom.Buy One. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,A winner!,"I've had mine for a couple of years now and still love it. I even bought a 2nd one as a gift. After experimenting with different temperatures (I have gas), and going through about 12 varieties of popcorn, I feel like I have mastered the craft. The super-fine popcorn salt is crucial. Unfortunately I also discovered that hands-down the best oil is the coconut oil-based stuff. BTW, the Wabash Farms Kettle Corn is shockingly delicious, but can be a cleanup chore."
3,Broken in a month,I got my popper on 14 may and and on 14 june it is broken.Today after making popcorn the whirley part just fell offwhile cleaning the lid. Does make great popcorn but shouldnot break after making just one 1lb bag of popcorn.
5,Best Popcorn Popper on the Planet,"I would recommend this popocorn popper to anyone, it works great only takes 3 minutes, doesn't burn the popcorn and makes enough to not make you feel like you need more especially if there are more than one of you. It is a great design and should last forever."
2,Broke after about 5 months,We had this popcorn maker for about 5 months before it broke. One of the plastic gears broke. They used to be made out of metal. It worked well up until that point I guess.
5,Love it!,We love this so much! I got it for my Husband's birthday on the 12th and we've used it every night since! It's so much fun and it makes great popcorn!
2,Not as good as before,"We had a popper like this, but this one in no way compares. The lid does not stay on, the fasteners don't grip the pan and donesn't stay on very well. The metal part that turns the popcorn inside the pan is not much bigger than a paperclip. The one we owned before was a lot better. This one hardly moves the popcorn around. I was sure this was the same brand that we owned before, but I would not recommend this popper. Perhaps they have one that is more expensive and works better, but it is difficult to tell when ordering on-line."
1,WHIRLEY POPPER,THE POPPER WORKED FINE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND THEN ONE OF THE PLASTIC GEARS BROKE. SHOULD BE MADE OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
4,Beware of the cheap gears,"It works great but takes a little time to learn how to use it. Olive Oil does work fine with it, but you must put it in before you turn the heat on. After about 30 uses the cheap plastic gears wore down and I'm waiting for new gears to be sent to me. But , when working correctly it does make great popcorn."
1,Not really REAL Apollo 12,"There is a little real Apollo 12, some clips with the real astronauts ANDlots of video of fake ""training."" This is a minor home movie"
4,Fantastic,"I watched the whole thing in one sitting. While one of the historians is a bit cheesie, the whole thing is great."
4,Enjoyable trip back in time,Great documentary for an older space buff. Maybe a little pricey unless a non-profit gets some of it.
4,Roy Richey,"Gilbert Kneiss was an official of the Western Pacific Railroad and Vice President of The Railway and Locomotive Historical Society. His Bonanza Railroads was a pioneer effort of railroad history publications started in the 1930's by contemporary authors Lucius Beebe and Charles Clegg. Though very general in nature it is an authoritative piece and set the stage for the many detailed rail histories to follow the end of World War II. Kneiss was technical advisor to ""Railroads on Parade"" at the New York World's Fair and Director of ""Cavalcade"" at the Golden Gate International Exposition at Treasure Island in 1939-40. He befriended Lucius Beebe in storage of his private railcar ""Gold Coast"" in the Stockton Roundhouse of the Western Pacifc in the 1950's prior to its donation to the California State Railroad Museum. Kneiss' volume belongs on the shelf of any true Western Rail Historian. He is truely one of the pioneers of railway history and preservation.Roy RicheyVirginia City, NV"
5,Don Williams - 'nuff said,"Don Williams is one of the ""best"", clear beautiful voice, exceptional talent. ""Lay down beside me"", my all time favorite, but there are sooooooo many good songs on this cd. Enjoy!"
5,The Best of Don Williams Vol 2,This is a great CD and I recommend it to any Don Williams Fan. I received this item within 7 days of my order
3,"Pretty good, but....","I used to attach a piece of wood to my mitre saw table with hot melt then gut the middle. I decided to buy the real deal. I like that you can remove them mid-job for the occassional flat cut, but I had trouble with one of them slipping away from the back fence if I applied too much pressure.Some have called them cheap in other reviews, but I would buy them again."
1,"won't do 6"" crown","With a little redesign work these could have be made to be used on 6"" crown. To bad Dewalt can't do a little re-engineering. I take them off and just use the wing nut to do 6"" crown. With a little adjusting you can get it rignt on the nose."
4,A Fine Upgrade,"This is a very well constructed shower head. It is large, however, and you will want to use it in a large shower. If using in a small stall, get an extension arm for it, as it will not have room to hang down properly. It only has one spray pattern, a moderate rainshower, that is very relaxing. The shower head is quite heavy, chrome plated and a quality looking piece. The jets all work, and are rubber-tipped. It makes overnight guests think they are in a 5 Star hotel."
4,Good little stocking-stuffer,"This miniature book brings a smile in every page. It is a book of cooking-related quotes by famous cooks and writers, illustrated with striking block paintings, like the one shown on the cover.The quotes are amusing and short, perfect to use as quips in emails to fellow cooking friends or in cooking chat rooms and forums."
3,Good product,"I looked into a Baby Bjorn because my daughter didn't like the sling I had. With the sling she lasted about 10 seconds before crying. With this BabyBjorn, she last about 5-8 minutes. No exaggeration. It seems like a good product but I am unable to use it as I had desired. For the short time I have worn it, the design and material seemed comfortable."
1,Buyer Beware!!! Please!,"I am at a loss for how carriers like the Bjorns get such great reviews- If you do your research on baby wearing, you will quickly learn that one of the number one things to know when baby wearing is that you should always make sure your baby's legs are in a ""frog leg"" position, meaning their legs are supported close to their inner knees so their knees are in line with their hips. Please do your research, perhaps google ""baby wearing safety"" before you purchase any carrier- it is important for you and for your baby.I will also say, this was our first baby carrier, and my husband and I found it to be very very uncomfortable, especially in comparison to our moby wrap. Because he doesn't like the ""fuss"" (it is second nature to me now- like tying a shoe) of tying up the moby, we bought an ""ONYA"" Baby carrier- it is newer to the market,but WAY more comfortable than any of the baby bjorns we have tried."
4,good product and good service,"I wanted a second hand babybjorn carrier and I got it. It was in a great condition, as it was described. A nice touch...I received it in a cute box with a little note from the seller. :-)"
3,Constant Adjustments,"I've had this for 6 months. It is fairly comfortable if it is adjusted perfectly, it is horrible if it is not. I find myself constantly making adjustments to it as baby gets bigger. My baby never fell asleep in it like he did the sling. I'm not sure I will use it anymore, now that I can use my sling in a hip carry position."
4,"A MUST HAVE, ESPECIALLY FOR A SECOND CHILD","I didn't purchase a baby carrier for my first child (now three) but after just having my second, it was a must have in order to keep up with my very active toddler in parks, ballgames, the circus, etc. The reason I chose the Baby Bjorn over the Ergo was because I am 5'2"" and found the Ergo to be a more bulky for my petite frame. The Baby Bjorn fits me just right. I find it very easy to get my baby in and out and to adjust the straps. I honestly cannot tell you that the ""Air"" model breathes any better than the original because I never used the original model but it seems to breathe well with my son and I like the elasticity this model has."
4,We use it,"This works well for different torso lengths, and grows with the child. It claims to be cooler than the regular version, but it's still pretty warm - I don't recommend for long periods in hot weather. Also, don't think you'll go for long hikes with this- baby's inner thighs and butt will get sore after a while with any of these type carriers. We did do shorter hikes using this from 6-9mo old. We used it for our first until she was about a year, then gave it to a friend for hers, now were using for our second-- pretty durable. Adjustment directions are on the inside of the product so you'll never lose them. It's very quick and easy to adjust. Baby LOVED going shopping in it from about 3-6 months, once she could face forward. I'm happy we bought it."
2,Better buy 'active' or 'synergy',"I bought this one for someone else because I love my 'active' bjorn. I ended up returning this one, because without the back support it is just not worth it. If $$ is an issue, you are better of with spending a few more bucks on 'active', if you do not want to spend double on 'synergy'"
4,Great carrier!,"This is a great carrier! My daughter loved it since she was about 3 months old. Even though her head was still not stable, she only liked facing out. She was happy and falls sleep in the carrier. My husband was able to put her down to crib without waking her up! This model is not too hot for summer, so that was a plus too. I'd give it 5 stars if I could use this carrier on my back."
3,good for the little ones,"We got this carrier to use with our daughter when we had problems with the newborn insert for the Ergo carrier. This was an excellent option when she was small (and light). She didn't overheat, even in Phoenix, AZ. Neither did Mom! However, because the weight is all on the shoulders, it was not much good after she started to gain a bit of weight. It also doesn't work as well as we would have liked for a long baby. Still, it did the job well for those first few months until she could ride in the Ergo without its insert."
5,Keeps Mom and Baby Cool,"I bought this (at another retailer) when it first came out and couldn't be more pleased. We have been using since my son was just a few weeks old and it does a good job of keeping both of us comfortable whether we are in the grocery store or enjoying the outdoors. At 4 1/2 months, we are now using the carrier front-facing. The adjustments are easy to make and the product, once you get the hang of it, is easy to use with baby."
2,not that great for the back,"The look and feel of this Baby Bjorn is great but I wish the design was similar to the other carriers. After just walking with my son for ten minutes, I can feel the strain. It says it can hold 25 lbs but the back definitely couldn't handle that much weight."
4,Good product,"The baby carrier is not very heavy and does its job. The back support is well designed as well, you can trust this carrier."
3,Ok for when baby was small & light....,"I loved this when my daughter was small, but when she got around 13-14 pounds my back killed. Her little feet and legs would also turn purple after 15 minutes. Not good. Go with the Ergo carrier if you can afford it- baby can't be front facing but you can wear baby on your hip or back so they can see forward. Ergo carrier distributes the weight much better and doesn't cut off their circulation."
2,Fine if you just want a carrier for a newborn,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this carrier is the best by the sheer number of them out there. We were given one by our parents when our son was born and it was fine for the first few months. However, as soon as he hit 15 lbs the shoulder pain became unbearable when wearing him for more than 5 minutes. We did an incredible amount of research and switched to an Ellaroo Mei Hip (also available on Amazon) and have never looked back. They are incredibly comfortable and shift the weight to the hip instead of the soft part of the shoulder. (Our friend has the Ellaroo Mei Tai carrier for her newborn and loves that too.)Ellaroo Mei Hip Baby Carrier - BlackAgain, this isn't a bad carrier, it just isn't that functional after the first few months. Its also padded in such a way that it is difficult to fold it up small enough to carry in the diaper bag and still have room for other stuff."
3,Father of twins,"We have 3 month old twins and I have one of these and an old school blue babybjorn. When we travel through airports we use these. The advantage of this gray & white carrier is that the fasteners at the top snap in quite nicely, much nicer than they did in past models.This is also more minimalist in design than the other model...I guess it's supposed to be more sporty, but it feels less secure.I still find this quite an uncomfortable product and would suggest new parents to consider other brands of slings etc. to carry their babies. After about half an hour of carrying around one of the little guys in this my back really starts to hurt. and the belt strap going across looks odd...it's white but the inside is grey (not matching the other straps...really an odd choice, must be a scandahoovian design."
4,Splurge for the more expensive one,"I have been using this exact Baby Bjorn for about 3 months now and I am pretty happy with it. I like how easy it is to use and adjust. The one major thing I don't like about this model is the lack of waist support. Because there isn't a strap around your lower back/waist, all of the babies weight is hanging on your shoulders and that begins to hurt very quickly. I wish I would have splurged and gotten the better model with the waist support. Do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more."
4,Great,"Works great for my baby girl! I got it so we didn't have to buy a infant carrier carseat and with two other kids, my baby is always close. After awhile my back starts to ache a little, but expected with a 15lb baby!"
4,Mr. Mom Bjorn,"My husband LOVES to use this whenever he can, whether its just walking around the house or doing some shopping. I like that it adjusts to both him and I, and its easy to tighten and loosen up. My son is only 2 months old and loves to be hugged up next to mom or dad. The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because where my son's legs and arms touch the baby bjorn have to be covered otherwise they rub and get all red. It doesn't seem to be painful at al for him though. Great product, I'd buy another one again!"
2,ok,We bought it but quickly returned it mostly due to the inability of it becoming a backpack. Bought the ErgoBaby Sport instead.
4,Great overall product,"I bought this carrier because my son likes to face out, and the carrier that we had does not support that. Also, he was born on the smaller side, and Baby Bjorn carriers are made to carry babies as small as 8 lbs, so we could use it comfortably sooner. My only complaint is that the shoulder straps are not very padded, so as the baby gets heavier it gets a little harder on your shoulders (this is why I gave it only 4 stars).It was delivered in a timely manner and the product was new as stated."
3,BEAUTIFULLY PACKAGED,"Whilst the BABYBJORN CARRIER was for gifting & not for our personal use, i must say the packaging was both beautiful & professional. Based on the professional & attractive way this product was presented, i would not hesitate to recommend same."
1,AWFUL TERRIBLE,"One of THE WORST carriers on the market. It hurts me, hurts my baby. After reading about the pressure and damage that is put on her spine I wish I could burn every bjorn/crotch dangler ever. So, so, so bad. A waste of money and a painful time. So glad we threw this away."
3,The Baby Bjorn Synergy is a better bet,"We own the Baby Bjorn Active Carrier, and we all love it! However, it is too hot for summer heat, so we opted to purchase this item--the Baby Bjorn Air Carrier. Without the lumbar support, all of the baby's weight is on the shoulders, and my husband could feel a huge difference. We didn't know Baby Bjorn had a new ""Air"" carrier, the Synergy, until we visited their website. It is made out of the same fabric as this one but is designed like the Active Carrier. So we are returning this one for the Synergy. Your lower back is well-worth the extra money! One less trip to the chiropractor or massage therapist will make up the difference!"
4,"Great product, reasonable price","It was really easy to use,The only problem is, once our baby turned 1, we can;t use it any more, It would be great if we could switch it to cary her on the back, because it is getting heavy to carry on the front."
3,ok product,"The product is from very good martial, very easy to use. i found that i have problem of stress on my baby legs. this make it hard to use for long trips."
2,"Great for infants, not so great once they face out","Love this for newborns. Super lightweight and easy to put on. Baby fits well and comfortably inside when facing in. But, once baby starts facing out, this carrier put lots of stress on my neck, back and shoulders. My baby gets excited and leans forward and kicks, adding even more to the stress. I'm in the market for finding a new carrier because even though my baby's only 14 pounds, she's already too heavy to carry facing out. For the amount of money you spend on a new one, I'd recommend finding something else."
5,Baby Carrier Supreme,"The product is great as it allows plenty of airflow between the baby and my body. Only downside is it has several snaps which in its defense are designed to make it easier to put on and take off, but really not necessary."
3,Cannot transcribe from LP mode,"I was so excited to purchase this bundle with Dragon naturally speaking software in Sony recorder but after opening everything and reading manuals, upset to find out that I cannot transcribe from LP mode (i.e. max. recording mode: 334 minutes). My primary purpose is to transcribe lectures from school. I've more than one class a day and it takes about 3 hours per class. Dragon software and Sony recorder themselves are good but if your intension is like mine, it's useless. It can transcribe only in stereo mode (41 min) and standard mode (125 min). I read all reviews from amazon and sony websties including fine prints but none of them mentioned it can't transcribe in LP mode. Hope this will help for your purchase."
1,"Big Hat, No Cattle","This book features a great title, but the content sure doesn't live up to that promise. I got the feeling this was created to give the author something to sell to suckers who come to her speeches.The material presented is old and tired. The concepts are puerile at best. I would assume most people learned these concepts when they turned about sixteen - basic stuff like how to shake someone's hand and whether to wear a hot pink pantsuit or the charcoal one to a business meeting. Very, very elementary stuff. I can't imagine who her audience is.The best title for this book, so it reflects the concepts it contains, would be ""How To Quit Your Job in Fast Food and Move Up To Shipping Clerk"". I'm returning the copy I just bought. How sad - she could have done something great with this if she'd put in just a little thought and effort."
1,Now made in China,"Just received my DW3178 blade from Amazon and see it is now made in China. Looked carefully on the Amazon site and couldn't find where it is made. For me there are too many other choices to buy a chinese blade, no matter how it cuts. Also wish Amazon more clearly showed country of origin."
2,Sanctuaries,"Every Monastery, Convent etc phone number I called is no longer in service!!! They put out a new book but didn't bother to update the correct information. Now that's bad!!"
4,Excellent resource for peaceful/meditation retreats,"Even though this book is about ten years old, it's still an excellent resource, and I highly recommend it. (I gave it only 4 stars because it's outdated, otherwise, I'd say 5 stars.)I was recently looking for a place to do a silent or meditation retreat. I had perused the internet, but frankly, when you don't know much about given places, it takes a long time, and a lot of effort to get reviews and information about different places.This book, however, lists hundreds of excellent places, and includes a personal review of each one, from which you can conduct a much more meaningful internet search.I highly, highly recommend this book if you want to know about the plethora of places across the United States where you can find a retreat, I was very happy with mine!"
5,Absolutely Gorgeous,I got this to replace one that I had bought in Cape Cod (the store where I had bought that one closed and I had lost a couple of stones from it) and it's the closest thing I could find to that one. It sparkles beautifully!
3,What's happening with our Gisselle??,"When I first heard the cd I was a bit disapointed because I had to pass to the fourth song to finally hear a merengue.In opinion,8 is not a cd for her first fans(los merengeros) it's more for new markets like Mexico and Spain.And the merengue songs on the cd are not what I was expecting for way to much slow merengue beats.Hopping that the next one will be totally merengue.I will always Gisselle cuz she has a charming voice and she is very pretty.Y como que! :)"
2,merenguera o baladista,"en este cd de gisselle hay mas baladas que merengue, cosa que no le ayuda mucho. las fotos y el repertorio es muy parecido al disco ""corazon de mujer"" de melina leon y vocalmente gisselle trato de que se pareciera al disco ""pasional"" de jessica cristina. gisselle tiene talento de sobra, pero la gente que maneja su carrera deberian de ser mas originales y no ponerla a imitar a otras cantantes como olga tañon, jessica cristina y melina leon. otra cosa es que gisselle es muy buena merenguera pero en este disco hay muchas baladas que no le quedan..."
3,"Mostly Ballads, Not Enough Merengue","This has the same critique as Olga Tanon's latest album. A pop album that was marketed prior to release as a merengue, quite deceiving. The album starts with a ballad and it takes a while to get to a merengue song, track four to be exact. There are three or four merengue songs total out of 14. Some ballads sound nice and others rather sleepy. Gisselle has a beautiful voice and is a great merenguera and sounds very sensual in ballads but it is a mistake to package all these different genres in one disc. A lot of people are dissapointed because they were expecting an album of mostly merengue."
5,"Before Jill Scott and Erykah Badu, there was Marlena Shaw","As much as I love Jill and Erykah, if Marlena Shaw were to drop an album today, it's no doubt that it would put these two artists' works to shame. Most of Shaw's albums weren't big sellers and some of them are even out of print, so if you want to get started on your search, begin with this collection. As with most ""Best of Marlena Shaw"" collections, ""Yu-Ma/Go Away, Little Boy"" appears on here, but other notables like ""Could It Be You"", ""Feel Like Making Love"", and a vocal version of the classic ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"" are also here. For Gang Starr fans, ""California Soul"" will sound familiar because this was sampled in the group's 1990 song, ""Check the Technique"". Check this album out."
3,Marlena Shaw California Soul,"Oh my god!I feel really ashamed because i have only just heard of Marlena Shaw!she is amazing!It all started when i went to Molokos in Cardiff and i heard California Soul.Ever since then ive been trying to find who invented this masterpiece.It is probably up there with one of my favourite songs ever,it just catches me,i love it.Can't wait to here her other creations!xxx"
4,Good fun album.,"I got this CD from Soulcracker's website when if first came out. I'm pretty sure that I was one of the first 1000, because they even took the time to sign the album before sending it to me. I thought that was really nice. I saw the band live when they came to the Boston area and they sounded pretty good. It's too bad that Beastie has left the band. I don't know if the Soulcracker sound will be the same without him."
2,Disappointing but not horrible,"Long story short, I saw these guys on VH1 and thought they were the best. To show my support I went to their website (which hasn't been updated in YEARS...wonder what that means!) and ordered a copy. The first track is pretty good, but as other reviewers mentioned, it becomes song after song of the same repetitive mall-punk teen-pop guitar. Talented? Sure. Talented enough to break out of their hometown? Probably not."
5,Liked it,"I am glad to have watched the video. I liked the system of cutting the blocks for the girders and how the joists were layed out and lapped, cut by eye. They do a lot of cutting by eye, and they do it good. They are fast and quick, how I want to be. He did a good job with showing the stairs also. those carpenters even have a sense of humor! must watch for beginning framer."
2,hummm...,"hi there i have been a carpenter for 20 years, i bought this video because i like watching them and who knows i might learn somthing knew,,,,, my dislikes are.....1) while larry was cutting the 4x4 blocks for the girders he did not mark them with a speed square there for they can be out of square and cause one side to be low or higher the what the block was measured for.2)the way larry manoverred his skilsaw was a little on the scary side.3) while putting on the sub floor larry did not put any insulation under the floor, and that is code most any where.4)the stair stringers were off set by one inch, thats not a bascic set of stairs.5) also on the stairs larry put the stringers tight against the wall, every set of stairs i have seen there is eather a 1x4 or 2x4 at the bottom of the stringer and then put to the wall that way sheet rock can go down futher and carpet can be tucked.LIKES.... 1)layout, laying out the joist before cutting them, and hold nails all in the same direction. thanks..."
5,Very solid DVD!,"I grew up around a father with no carpentry skills whatsoever.Therefore, I reached adulthood, not knowing how to do many of the things I wanted to, regarding basic carpentry. This DVD is very professional, and he is a very good teacher. Clear, concise and simple."
4,Erelli lullabies,"I disagree with the previous reviewer; this is not a Tom Waits album, nor is it meant to be. These are lullabies that Mark Erelli is singing to his infant. As such, I think a whiskey-soaked voice would not be what one is looking for. The tone is much quieter than other Erelli albums. I enjoyed the music, and considered why he created it when I bought it, to play to my own children."
5,Quiz question and answer,"I wrote a review of ""Footlight Parade"" a couple of years ago and don't want to replace it. However I recently discovered a trivia fact about the film and decided to toss in this question: What is unusual about the several times the pianist plays the song ""Ah, the moon is here"" during the audition scene?Answer: Each time the song is in a different key. When Mary has a go at it, it is in B-flat (as it is when Dick Powell and Frank McHugh demonstrate the piece in their hilarious duet). When the opera singer who gets into her singing mood with perfume (""Forget the smell, honey; sing"") gives it a try, it is in C. Finally, when the woman who wins the audition sings it, it is in G. Presumably, the pianist had worked with this troupe for a long time and knew each singer's preferred key..."
5,A Gem !,"I completely agree with one friend that told me this was one of Cagney's most underated films although it is fantastic. The musical numbers designed by Busby Berkeley are outstanding and the final number ""Shangai Lil"" is a pleasure for moviegoers and especially if they are Cagney's fans like myself.... After seeing this movie you can understand why Jimmy Cagney would won an Oscar for Yankee Doodle Dandy nine years later, his role as Chester Kent is an anticipation of his George Cohan role...The performances by the rest of the cast are excelent especially Joan Blondell who shines as Jimmy's Assistant...I really spend and excelent time watching ""Footlight Parade"" being this 1933 gem ""a must see"" for the legion of Cagney's fans...."
4,"Can't stop singing ""Shanghai Lil""!","I've watched Footlight Parade several times. Like other Cagney fans, I marvel at his versatility as he goes from gangster films to musicals. I love every minute of this movie, but the icing on the cake is the ""Shanghai Lil"" sequence. If you've never seen Cagney do anything but gangsters, you must see him as an absolutely adorable, dancing, singing ""gob"". And, the ""Shanghai Lil"" music is performed in so many styles thoughout this final sequence that you can't get it out of your head. ""I've been lookin' high, I've been lookin' low, lookin' for my Shanghai Lil."" Don't miss this one!"
2,The color is awful!,"I bougth this dust ruffle because of the color in the picture... It looks like a really pretty blue color, like the one on the baby pooh crib set... but when I got it... I was really disapointed.. the color is really dark... that picture has nothing to do with the real color... is awful."
3,not as good as the label's blurb,"It's either impressive or dispiriting that Celestial Harmonies should include such puffery (the above) to promote their albums. ""Mechanique"", for my taste, errs too much on the side of 'gentle, new age music'. If you want something that will lull you to sleep, fine, but you won't find anything especially stimulating here."
4,Saw them live...and I had to get the cd..,I just got their new cd...and its fantastic...for some odd reason they give me the Jimmy Eat World vibe..does anyone agree?
3,No Knife? More like no more hardness!!,"I'm sorely disappointed in this new CD. On ""Drunk on the Moon,"" there was a certain freshness...with a little room for improvement. On ""Hit Man Dreams,"" that improvement was made with the addition of the new guitarist/2nd songwriter, Ryan Ferguson. With the loss of drummer Ike Zarimba, the beats on this one are simply not hard enough. The beats leave much to be desired. The vocal stylings were also changed somewhat....with the harmonies being somewhat low, giving it an unpleasing sound. Some songs, namely, ""Academy Flight Song,"" ""Charming,"" and ""Minus One,"" are all great songs, but misrepresent the feel of this album. Again, I'm a little disappointed in the direction the band has gone in terms of sound. If you wanna try something new and you've never heard of em, start here. If you've heard em before, I might warn you..it's DIFFERENT than it was...a BIG departure from the traditional No Knife sound!! Listen at your own risk!!"
4,A great accomplishment!,"There have only been a few artist that I have listened to, and knew that I would follow there work for many years to come, and this is one of them (others would be Indigo girls & Ben Harper). I found them on IUMA and fell in love with the songs, ""Where I am"" and ""Stereo""! I bought the CD and was surprised to find that almost every song grabbed me and took me to the same place these songs did.The only reason I gave a 4, instead of a 5, is because there is one song, I won't point out, that sounds like it was put on the album, just because someone thought it was ""commercial""!.. If I know these guys from the quality of the rest of the CD, this track was most likely voted on by a manager, producer or Label ...I don't know ...but, the rest of the CD is definitely a 5!Charlie, CA"
3,OK for the price,"This is not a bad tool, but it does not seem to be as durable as I had hoped. The variable speed feature ceased to function within a few days and the on/off switch is a bit difficult. It does a good job of sanding without swirl marks, just don't expect to have a variable speed sander for very long."
2,"Good sander, poor electronics","I bought this sander after doing much research. It worked great on one and a half projects, a front door and part of my kitchen table. Part way through the kitchen table it flat out quit. I took it to a Dewalt S/C and they tell me that the Variable Speed switch is an obsolete part. They didn't even bother to put it together. I think I'll go back to Porter Cable."
2,"Bad switch, bad company",This tool's switch went out too soon for an $80 sander. Other dewalt tools have broke prematurely for my satisfaction.I was persuaded into switching all new purchases to dewalt after much high pressure sales garb...I will be going back to tried and true PC and Makita.
2,Not Very Rugged,"This sander is well below Dewalt's typical standards. The design is fairly good, but durability is severly lacking. It has already bit the dust (no pun intended) with very little use over a few months. Very, very disappointing. I'm going back to Porter Cable."
2,"Bad switch, dust port.","I own several Dewalt tools, and am overall happy with the quality - however, this sander has two notable defects: the on/off switch (as others have noted) seems to be of bad quality, mine seems to get caught in between on and off -- the switch seems to be designed to be operated with one hand, but the defect makes this difficult. Also, when attaching my Fein shop vac (*highly* recommended) to the little dust port, it quickly wiggles loose -- and the vac does stay attached to other Dewalt tools properly. On the bright side, this sander *does* sand well, leaving a nice finish in a very short amount of time.PS: (I make it a little practice to note where each Dewalt tool I buy is manufactured, anything that can be tracted back to Elu, or made in Italy is of high quality, hint, look where the owner's manual was printed)-"
2,Awkward power switch,I was very unhappy with the power switch on this product. Look closely at the Porter Cable 333VS and PC 333PK before you make this purchase.
3,Weak dust collector assembly,"I've had the sander for just over a year and it has performed very well, until now. The dust collector assembly keeps coming off, every 30 seconds! The design of how the dust colletor port is attached is very weak, in my opinion. My work-around is to wedge a small piece of anti-skid matting in the port. A small sheet metal screw driven through the dust collector assembly and the port may also improve this poor design."
4,"Stylish, modern watch","Only criticism is that it has no background light function, so viewing time in the dark is essentially impossible."
4,Collector Item,It was pretty much what I was expecting. I thought maybe the gun would light up but it doesn't. However it is a nice collector item for any avid Futurama fan like myself. Arrived in mint condition :)
2,Does NOT run on Batteries.,I should have contacted the seller first and asked questions. It does not run on batteries. It works only by continually squeezing the trigger. Not easy for a 3 Y.O. The light is not bright and it makes no noise. The light is made by sparks from a grinding wheel inside. If you want a gun from the 50's made of tin that is sort of quiet this is it. If you want bright lights and some noise choose something else.
2,not fun,These are aggravating to use as they do not stay closed and spill coffee everywhere. Will not order again.
1,Inaccurate product description.,This product did not include any information about the separate component you need in order for them to work. The Pods did not come with any instructions. How were we supposed to know you need to buy a unit to seal these!
3,Good (messy) coffee,"It would help if I didn't have to waste three cups of coffee trying to find the right amount put to into the pod. Also, it just doesn't seal properly. You will have grounds spilling out."
2,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE,I like this product very much but it's important to also follow the prices. I had to drop the rating down to 2 stars from 4.5 stars because of the drastic price increase. The last time I bought it the price was $32.18. An E-Mail advertisement arrived today at $47.55. The price went up $15.37 which is an increase of 48%. THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS!!
4,Great Must Have Tai Chi DVD,"Firstly to the other reviewers posted here take a chill pill. While I agree that there were a couple of minor guffaws in terms of some exterior noise and I think one time a door opened, there is really nothing offensive at all. The picture quality is very good and most importantly Sifu David Chang is a remarkable instructor who is both very inspirational and very gifted. The moves are learned SO easy it's a joke. A teacher like this is worth his weight in platinum, but seriously teaching like this is rare even on China dvds. If you want complicated look elsewhere. If you want to learn real beginning Tai Chi and get a GREAT workout BUY THIS DVD and his other DVD on Tai Chi For Weightloss."
3,Great instructor,"As the other reviewer said, the production quality of the video is poor (you can tell it was filmed in one take in what seems to be an acutal Tai Chi studio with a bathroom door in the background...also you can hear traffic going by outside). All that aside, the instructor is great, and in my opinion that's what matters. If you can just picture that you're in a classroom with this guy getting private instruction then it's not bad. He's very knowledgable and explains the moves really well. I felt like I got a good workout."
2,Not what I expected,I wish I would have known or seen this video before I bought it as it is a complete and total waste. The instructor seism to know what he is doing but the quality is just terrible.Another DVD disappointment in my collection.
2,YUK!,"I didn't care for it and I didn't like the fact that their best tune was left off""drowning in a daydream""My guy liked it though.. Honey, if it comes up missing I had nothing to do with it :)"
4,The great return,"Subzero are back, and we are so blessed! Necropolis is a great reminder of why we all (or some of us) love hardcore. They grab you right by the throat with the opening title track, and never let go. The hardness and melodies are all there. Additional stand out cuts are 'Dirty Needles', 'Swinherd' and 'Prepare Unto Battle (Kill or Be Killed)'."
3,Carpenter anyone?,"The detail and directions are very well done. If you are a carpenter or have enough experience working with your hands and understand the carpentry terms you probably could do this. There are excellent ideas here for anyone's backyard. I will be using some of these myself next year, when I hire a carpenter."
4,Decent harness,"Works as advertised. I was able to solder all my connections on a bench before I installed my new radio, pretty straight-forward instructions."
2,downer,"when the first track ""Tailfin"" ended, i was hooked! i listened to the same track again and was ready for more. sadly, my excitement began to dwindle rapidly as the album progressed. overall, this kind of lukewarm jazz is just not my cup of tea. it just sounds a bit too tepid for me. the playing is nice, but the atmosphere is stuffy and to reserved for my tastes. ahh--if it all could only have been more like ""Tailfin."""
5,"The Eagle Aloft"" Two Centuries of the Balloon in America","Was researching Virginia's W&M senior, Joseph Shelton Watson, who, in 1802, was the first Virginian from Louisa County, Va. to design, build and send aloft a hot-air balloon! Found excellent research material on my hero, Watson...thanks!"
5,very instructive book,This book helped me understand how really Paris was before Haussman did his work. I recommend this book to any person who is interested in Paris and it's history
5,Brilliant Work,Amazing CD!!! A must have for all About Productions fans. I also highly recommend to those interested or searching for the early experiences of Mexican Americans/Chicanos in the United States. This is not a traditional historical material in the way anthropologist gather information but in my opinion a more important and rare source being a historical piece by way of how families/insiders have access to intimate knowledge.
1,faulty zipper made this useless after 1.5 years,"A product is only as good as its weakest point, and in this case that was the zipper.The zipper began to fail after 6 months and became useless after 18 months. This bag did not get hard use, but the zipper was an inferior grade: it had too-small teeth and they failed to mesh and broke. Once the zipper failed the whole bag was useless."
4,"Sturdy, good for kids","My kids got these a couple of years ago (teenagers). They have held up great. No ripping or tearing, zippers still work. I got one myself and I like it too.Pros: The straps are comfortable. There's a small phone/MP3 player zippered pocket on the top, under the handle. Top handle not just ornamental, padded.Cons: Wish there were more internal slots for things like pens, etc. in the front pocket. There's only a mesh sort of half pocket. I don't like the compression straps on either side of the backpack. I have these on some other bags and I don't like them there either. They get in the way and I don't find I need to strap down the contents that often.Mystery: There's a little pocket on the top of the right strap. What is that for?"
4,JanSport Air Vital backpack,Great backpack! I have had the same one in red for over a year and being a fashion-conscious female wanted a new color to work with my spring wardrobe. The red one still looks practically brand-new even after 2x per week use/abuse and a winter road trip to Yosemite. I spent so much time evaluating different packs before buying the red one and was so pleased with it that I just ordered the same pack in a different color. My only complaint is that the straps could be a little more contoured to avoid cutting in at the trapezius muscles.
4,Excellent book with excuses,If you like the AR-15 or are just interested in it you should buy this book. Probably the best all-around AR-15 book I have ever seen. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because Mr. Sweeney spends way too much time making excuses for the deficiencies of the M-16 and the 5.56 round. Those of use who have used this rifle in combat are well aware of it's issues.
4,The AR 15,This is a series of articles from various experts on the Ar 15 rifle. It is what the person who is considering buying the Ar 15 needs.
3,Reprints of magazine articles and filler,"I have all 4 volumes of this title. They are all reprints of magazine articles that Patrick wrote for various magazines along with some filler added to bulk the books up. There is some good, useful information in the 4 volumes but if you add all the good info up and condensed it down, you would have about one or 2 chapters worth of material out of 4 books. The man knows what he is talking about but some of his text and pictures are ancient history and just reviews of guns and manufacturers that don't even exist anymore. If we get another AWB, 95% of them will not exist anymore. If you are looking for a compendium of Mr. Sweeney's magazine articles on the AR over the years, then you have come to the right place and by all means grab all four volumes. I did."
2,Did they even have an editor?,"This book is rifle with misspellings on nearly every page, ranging from typos to transposition of possessives and contractions. It's just a mess.The writer also veers off on wild tangents continually from the subject being covered, anecdotes that have absolutely nothing to do with the paragraph, only to go back to the subject awkwardly.It really, really needed an editor."
3,not quite all that,the book was recomended by a site as a must have. I find it talks more about this brand and that brand and how the military views this or that and not really about building or trouble shooting an AR. As a matter of fact there is very little about how too's or any definitions about technical terms in the book. Really disapointed. Would not recomend.
2,Patrick let us down,"Regarding AR-15 Volume #2Most of the reviews here are clearly for the first volume which I also enjoyed thoroughly. I could hardly wait for volume 2 to become available. However it was quite a let down. It was virtually void of the technical information Patrick usually provides and instead was filled with quips and comments. He spent too much time trying to be funny and or arrogant instead of providing his usual first class reviews. Editing left a lot to be desired as relevant pictures were often pages away from the text they supported. I have many of Patrick's books, but,I definitely would not recommend AR-15 Volume 2, sorry Patrick, you let us down with this one."
2,A very poor second volume,"The primary value of this effort is the evaluation of manufacturers which have changed in the two years between volumes. Otherwise this is a disorganized mess, with some of the poorest proofing I have seen in years. Typos appaar on almost every page. All of the real meat on the AR-15 is in the first volume and that is the one to buy. Leave this one in the bargain bin."
1,Just Say No.,"There is nothing in this book that you cannot find by searching the web for thirty minutes about the AR-15. It' filled with cliches and self serving comments. The spell checking was bad as well. The last couple of chapters of the book is truly advertising for AR-15 gun accessory manufacturers. If you are looking for something technically informative, I would recommend by Zedicker Building guide or the Competitive AR book he has done. Also the Marine Corps Field Guide to the M16A2 is very informative. This is typical Guns & Ammo publication. Lots of fluff, little substance."
2,Not that impressive,"I bought this book without too many expectations, thankfully.The author may indeed have used many AR-15 pattern rifles, but I find the book to be chock full of opinion and speculation. There are very few hard facts in here. The few facts that are present are of little consequence.Still, it was reasonably entertaining, and it isn't very expensive.This book is not going to be a valuable resource for any novice builder or collector. It is only an entertaining read for those who know their gear.In short, this is simply A BOOK, that happens to be about certain AR-15s and certain parts for AR-15s. This is not THE BOOK of anything at all. For most, it is going to be a waste of time."
4,a little wider than expected,"the fit isn't my favorite, and they went a little overboard with the discoloration stripes in the front, but other than that they are comfortable and durable. They also run a little large, I usually wear a 36x34 and probably could have gotten away with getting 34x34, or even a 32 inseam."
2,Review of Naturalizer Shoes,"First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look. But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot. In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters. I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the ""leather"" will soften up and become easier to wear."
1,You look like a [flop] to me...,"I'm sorry, but what this guy is selling is just one blinding flash of the obvious after another. As a first-time expectant father, I thought I'd get some useful information from this book, especially since my wife's cousin (also new parents) recommended it to me. Quinton Skinner comes across as a very immature, self-centered man whose answer to everything is to stick his head in the sand like an ostrich. As was the case with another reviewer, I only made it halfway through the book before his whining drivel got the best of me. Avoid this book at all costs if you want to learn anything about being a real dad who participates in- and helps with his wife's pregnancy and labor and in raising a happy and healthy child."
4,Very funny approach to fatherhood,I bought this book for my husband and I laughed throughout the book. It is a very realistic approach to Fatherhood for the corporate jet setter.
4,How to make a soft pad last,most complaints about soft pads can be fixed witha quick trip to home depot and a few bucks1: mount it on plywood using tape. do not use tacs or nails. use it along the edge of the pad as to not interfere with the sensors.2: cover the pad with plastic sheeting. (and you though it was only good for protection from terrorists) a thick plastic cover will protect the pad and even allow you to leave your shoes on.3: Make shure that you turn of the control in the options menu. Otherwise the X/O/Square/Triangle can read as wrong buttons and influence your score. this can happen easily on a soft pad.4: optionally you can add soft padding (1/4 inch foam works) if you are not going to play with your shoes on to kepp your feet from yelling at you for playing all those hours.
3,...What a shame...,"This was the first kind of DDR mat i've ever bought for my DDR game when I got it about 8 months ago. These pads are durable, but better made for beginners. When I play heavy mode songs, I slide clear cut across the carpet, and I dont even push very hard. I reccomend actually buying an official Konami pad, because these stick to the floor better and stay in place. Of course, when I always play against someone, I end up against a wall and my pad rides into it, while my friend is in place the whole time. >>; Do not buy this if your a good DDR player. This is for beginners only.I really only had a few problems with mine. Ive had them for 8 months and it hasnt ripped or anything. So sometimes the sensors get out of position.. but they do go back. My two pads are fine. Although I usually have to drag my pad back to the other side of the room after I play one heavy song. X_X;"
2,Fatally Flawed,"I've got two dance pads; one from Mad Katz and this Naki pad. This one is more comfortable, since it's got extra padding on the bottom, and it stays put on my wood floors no matter what I do with it. Unfortunately, it never makes the good grades, because it has a fatal flaw: you can't press two of the same buttons simultaneously.While this may not seem like a big deal, it comes up quite often for those of us with big feet. You step on the left or right arrow and your foot overlaps the triangle or square. With your other foot, you step on an arrow; you hit it square, ""Perfect!"" on the beat, but the dance pad won't register the step. ""Boo!"" There goes you score, your strobe light, your rating... Extremely annoying.Additionally, the extra padding makes it difficult to fold, and it never seems to lie exactly flat. (Mine always has a hump on the top row.)"
2,Not a good pad,I bought this pad as a spare because I was having a group of people over for a party. I brought it out since I didn't want everyone to ruin my better pads and sure enough this thing broke after about 6 hours of playing on it. It is thin and pretty flimsy and my friends who own it have said the same thing. Stick with redoctane and you'll never be sorry you spent the extra money.
1,Poorly built DDR pad - much better starters out there,"I bought two of these when I first purchased DDR, almost 2 years ago. They were cheap, and I guess I got what I paid for. However, it isn't nice when you're playing DDR, step on the Up arrow on the pad, and find out that the pad didn't recognize the step because the electronics behind it had shifted a bit in the pad.The pieces in the pad slide around too much, making efficiency and dependability very low.There are better pads out there - ones with non-slip pads on the bottom and ones with special coverings. I'd recommend those over these pads any day.I'd definitely steer clear of these pads, no matter what dance level you play at."
2,okay...,"it may look good in the picture on the website, but it doesnt actually look quite like that. Mine wouldnt stop crumbling up when i got it, and it was never straight. o.0' It kept scooting a little to the left, and i barely moved anything. >.<To add to that, the start button was stuck. Maybe its the pad, or maybe they just send me a bad one, but i still have to return it. Since this is the best pad amazon.com has, im just going to have to order the ignition pad (a more expensive pad, but worth the money) from elsewhere.okie, thanks you for reading this! *wavewave*=^-^="
2,Great if you are new to DDR... Bad if you are not.,"My friend bought DDR about six months before I did and I could only play it when I went to his house. He had this pad. This pad was great when I was playing ""beginner mode"" because even if the pad did slip there was enough time between arrows to get off the mat and adjust it again. However, when I started playing light and standard mode it was a whole different story. The pad often slipped and I often stood on an arrow by mistake thinking that it was the middle of the mat. The back arrow of the mat stopped responding if you tried to press it. However, this pad is great for beginners. I would recommend a wireless ""Night Moves Pad"" if you are more advanced. This is avaliable at many stores. The price is $40. I was amazed when I compared it to the pad my friend had. I guess good equiptment really is an important part of Dance Dance Revolution."
2,Its not a very good mat...,"I got this mat for my daughter's birthday. For the first few days, it worked great, she played it practically every day. After a while though, it stopped responding. Also, you can never tell where you are standing on it, and sometimes you end up pressing a different arrow. It works, but barely. I would only recommend this to someone who could not afford a better one or is using it only for a few weeks."
1,Broken.,I had the pad for a couple of months and it broke! The down button continues to click on its own and it is messing the gameplay. Mine doesn't look like the pad it shows above either.
3,Found a PROBLEM!!,When the saw gets caught in material a few times it starts haveing problems with the guts!! I've had to take mine apart half a dozen times now and put the parts back in the slots they belong in!! Mostly where the fork fits into a small hole! Hope they fix this problem before I decide to buy another.
4,Very cute stickers,"This collection of stickers is a must have if you're a Monet fan. They include all of his most famous paintings, from water lilies to haystacks; and they can be used for most anything. It's a great set to give to a child who is learning about art, or even those who just like the nice scenery. Under each picture it tells you the name of it, and I especially like the fact that for being stickers, they still have so much detail. I'd recommend them to anyone who is a lover of art, or just likes to decorate things up with a little color."
4,A Must Have For Kenny Chesney Fans!,"This collection of videos is a must have for Kenny Chesney fans. Aside from the videos, there is footage of the band and other people on Kenny's crew...along with Kenny's bio, awards and the address to join his fan club. If I had to pick something I didn't like, it would definitely be the fan footage...there were too many messages to Kenny from his fans...I would rather have seen more footage of Kenny himself. Other than that, it was great and I give it 4 stars!!"
1,what a joke...,"this is supposed to be entertainment? well,wait...yeah, it is...comedy! what a joke to think anyone with half a budweiser soaked brain thinks this guy has an ounce of talent...people that like this stuff probably are the same people who like Tim McGraw,Toby Keith and the like...if you ask them ""who has more talent, the eagles or Kenny Chesney?"" their likely answer would be the latter...what are they putting in that there budweiser lately? must be some kinda mind numbing stuff to make people think this waste of space- poor excuse for a human being and even sorrier excuse for a musician could even stand in the same room with a legend like the Eagles or Fleetwood Mac...it's really sad to see the music industry fall to this low a level...speaking of Fleetwood Mac, has anyone heard the awful rendition of ""Landslide"" by the Dixie Chicks? sounds like someone scratching the chalkboard to me...check out the original,and judge yourself...if you know what talent is when you hear it..."
2,Not Well Designed,"What it does is very simple. It hooks up to the longest plunge stop screw on DW621. As you turn the knob, it rotates the screw. As the screw is inserting or releasing from the base, the router body is raised or lowered. The problem is1) Range of height adjust is only 1+ inch.2) If you raise to the end, the screw will jam and if you lower to the other end, the screw will come off from the base.3)There are three screw joints along the line of connection. Thus, often you end up unscrewing the knob instead of lowering the bit.4) The knob is too close to the dust collection port making it hard to turn.5) In order to raise 1 inch, you got to turn the knob 30 times with your two fingers.They could have provided 1) a hookup for the stop screw and the existing fine adjuster. 2) An extension handle for the existing fine adjuster hex hole. Then, they would do a better job than this adjuster."
1,boring,"with so many wonderful, creative, and clever craft project books out there, don't bother with this one. i would suggest any book by jocasta innes instead- she is a designer who is always inovative and original."
2,"Worked for a while, then...","This unit worked reliably for a year, then started to go off, on it's own, in the middle of the night. Consistently, in the middle of the night. After a couple of weeks of troubleshooting, and waking up my two toddlers, I'm replacing with a different brand. All the other units in the house still work reliably, and have detected even trace amounts of smoke. Maybe I just got a bad one?"
5,Happy with purchase,Arrived earlier than expected. Were a snap to install and have not had any problems. Bought them to replace three older single mode brk detectors. Would recommend this brand and vendor.
5,BRK SC9120B Smoke/Carbon alarm,"I kept putting off changing out my 7 year old alarms but finally decided to get going on it. I was pleasently suprised how easy it was to replace the existing BRK's, simple is the only word for it. Remove the existing plates, screw in the new ones, insert the existing plug, test and forget."
1,Easy Install,"This was easy to install but we had a smokey house a few times and nothing was going off, hit the test button and it shows its working fine. I do not trust this for my safety!"
5,not to shabby,This worked well .I thought i had bought the NG modle but this worked with a test gas that I used . So far so good.
5,smoke and CO alarm,"Very good technologie at a very good price. The installation can't be more easy. I just don't understand why the explanations on how to do is so long.You can connect them together, and they got a battery in the package. You can be confident on buying it. I bought on amazon and I received it 3 days after with free shipping"
4,First Alert Smoke alarm,Very sensitive (a good thing). Plenty loud enough to wake even the heaviest sleeper! I am very happy with this purchase.
4,Easy replacement,"My old combo alarm died after 9 years of service. This was a replacement model and was not available locally. Strangely enough, the identical part number (9120B) locally was much cheaper, but for a reason: it was only the smoke alarm! Not sure why it was the same number.Anyway, replacement was a breeze. The old alarm was A/C hardwired, and the same connector fit into the new one. When I ran the test, the all the alarms in the house went off, as they should.The new alarm came with a 9V Duracell already installed."
3,Reviewing 60 units,"All units in our condo complex have one of these types of alarms and 2-4 of http://www.amazon.com/First-Alert-9120B6CP-120-Volt-Wire-In/dp/B000KKHWLU/ref=pd_bxgy_hi_text_z . Out of 60, four were replaced because of constant false alarms (Three of these were in uninhabited units so we tried the alarms in other areas [Outside, in non alarming apartments, etc]) and they still kept going off. All alarms were less than 4 years old. Four out of sixty is kind of high considering the recommendation is to call 911 immediately and evacuate the _ out of there. Additionally (not sure if to blame this or the other smoke only alarms) once one alarm had a low battery at least two other alarms triple-chirped."
1,PITA,"Our house is only three years old. In the past two weeks, one by one a detector is going off alerting ""CO Move to Fresh Air"". Every time it happens, I have one poor dog who pees on the floor. I have tested batteries, opened windows, etc. I finally had the furnace guy out. He could not find any trace of CO. Apparently these things were not meant to last. So far four detectors have done this. I am grateful that all four went off during the day! That is the only good news about these."
2,Cheap Product = Absolute crap,"My contractors installed these 3yrs ago. I didn't know how cheap these were. 6 months ago i installed a brand new Duracell Battery. It gave me problems initially then worked. Today it kept beeping for low battery. I cleaned it, vacuumed it and installed a new duracell battery. Now it just won't work. Then i read some reviews stating the duracell doesn't go well with this smoke detector. I installed a new Energizer battery and it worked instantly. It means only One thing. This product is not well designed and there some circuitry issues. Duracell is one the top battery brands (not a battery issue for sure). In a year i will replaced all my smoke detectors and use a different/more reliable brand. and I will make sure all my friends and family members know about this so they don't make the mistake of buying this piece of crap in the future."
4,Great deal,My CO detector part of this unit went out after 7 years. Guess that's not bad. Got a great deal on this one to replace it.
5,BRK Electronics,I have BRK Smoke Detectors and needed to add Carbon Monoxide Detectors. The SC9120b plugged right into existing. All I had to do was change out the mounting flange which was supplied. 5 minute job to complete.
4,Much better product than previously,"My apartment came with the BRK model smoke detector before it became a First Alert product. At that time, I upgraded to the First Alert combo CO2/Smoke detector but it used to go off (false alarms) even if you boiled water! It was crazy. The reason I kept this particular brand/model is so that I could just unscrew the detector from the base, unplug it and install the new one without having to change the base from the ceiling. So that smoke/CO2 detector somehow went bad. It would continue ringing even though there was no smoke/CO2 and had a fresh, back-up 9-Volt battery. I repurchased one online. The new one works great as it is not nearly as sensitive as the older model. I just hope it goes off if it really needs to go off!"
4,CO/Smoke Detector,Typically timely Amazon delivery. The installation was safe and easy by following instructions provided. The CO/smoke detector tested satisfactorily and is in use.
1,Stay clear of this headache,Received three BRK SC9120B replacements after original units (4 years old) started a low battery chirp with new Duracell batteries. Spoke with BRK rep. about problem and they sent three new units with Duracell batteries. The units worked fine for about two weeks before all three started to chirp a low battery signal. In that time our other three BRK smoke only detectors that were installed 4 years ago started the same chirping sound. Again called BRK and they were going to send us three replacements for them. After the nightmare of having six four year old BRK products fail in a matter of three weeks and three brand new replacement units fail in two weeks. I would stay away from BRK! I have read elsewhere about an issue with BRK and Duracell so I was a bit surprised when the new units arrived with Duracell batteries in them.
1,Garbage,"Terrible product. Malfunctioned after only 1 year. Woke my entire family up at five in the morning. Got,everyone out into the freezing cold, Bly for the fire dept. to tell me the unit is faulty. I see numerous complaints. Add me to the list."
1,"False alarm went off the moment we installed it, and did not stop even after we uninstalled","This product immediately triggered a false alarm. There was no way to stop this unit from indicating a false smoke alram other than disconnecting it, and pulling the 9V battery from the unit."
1,"Falsy Advertised as ""Easy to Install""","First of all, this does not come with a power connector you can plug into your wall. Second, it requires you connect it to a junction box which was not mentioned in the ad. I do not have a junction box and it's necessary for AC power which means I would have to buy one and figure out how to install that as well. I am not familiar with any of the ""easy to install"" installation instructions and am glad I can just use the battery backup as the main power source. Do not buy this if you don't know how to connect wires to junction boxes and it also requires a wire stripper which you would also have to buy. For this price and all the wonderful reviews I at least expected to be able to install it without buying more stuff and getting my Electrician father-in-law to help."
5,Great Smoke and CO2 Alarm,"These units were perfect for replacing my hardwired smoke only alarms. It would have been nice if someone would offer a wifi version of a hardwired alarm to allow the units to talk to each other if the communication wire in the hard wired set up had not been previously run.Other than that, 10 minutes to install 2 new units.It would be nice if the manufacturer of these units were to give you more information on how to properly recycle the old units as they have some radioactive material in them. I was able to find the address for First Alert to send my old units to for recycling. $20 in shipping to recycle them, however better than the land fill."
4,Previously returned item,"I received and installed the First Alert SC9120B alarm yesterday. I noticed when I first opened the box the alarm was contained in that it was not covered inside the dust cover that was used in the Kidde units that I had purchased through Amazon. Additionally, as part of the post installation checks, a green LED is supposed to be lit and visible through the 'POWER' hole of the unit, indicating the unit is operational. When I first checked, I did not immediately see the lit green LED but after a more concentrated effort saw that the LED was lit but through the space surrounding the 'TEST/SILENCE' button. While it 'appears' that the unit is functional, I'm not sure that the LED had gotten dislodged from where it is supposed to be installed within the unit, i.e., visible through the 'POWER' hole.Also, since the alarm was not shipped covered in the dust cover, I suspect that either the manufacture failed to use the cover or I received an alarm that had previously been returned."
3,Dies in Two Years; Otherwise OK,"Our builder put five of these in our house. So far, two have died after two years, in a highly annoying way: The CO detector goes nuts and produces false alarms continuously. This completely terrorized our dogs and gave us headaches. (We did have the fire department over to check CO levels when the first one went, so we know the alarms are false.) I would have looked for a longer-lasting unit, since they're not exactly cheap, but they're all wired together and changing that would be painful. Amazon seems to have the best price on them, by a significant amount, so here I am."
3,Replacement for same unit,"These came with my condo and last only 5 years. They are rated so they should work OK my only gripe is the door for the battery, which is tricky to use."
2,False CO alarm,"After less then two years, the alarm will go off and indicate ""CO."" This alarm will continue even when placed outside and no other alarm's going off."
1,Stay Away!!! Constant False Co alarms,Had 4 of these combo units... just unplugged the last one and purchased non hard wired co detectors these were just terrible!
3,First Alert SC9120B,I just contacted them about one that has failed after 4 years in the 5 year warranty. They told me to throw it away and they are sending me a replacement. Previous negative posts must have had some influence.
1,Nothing but Trouble,"Our state passed a law requiring CO detectors in all sleeping areas. Since my existing wired smoke detectors were nearing the end of their life, I thought I would just replace them all (7 units) with the SC9120B model. For the first year they worked fine. The next year after that I started seeing a unit falsely alarming a CO alarm. Replaced that unit under warranty and found that it only worked when it isn't connected to the other units. 9 months later, a different unit started to alarm on CO, falsely. Since I wasn't home at the time, the fire department had to locate the issue. The fire dept made a comment that these type of detectors are notorious for false CO alarms and recommended that I switch back to smoke alarms only and get a stand alone CO detector. The stand alone smoke alarms are good for 10 years whereas the combined smoke/CO detector are only good for 7 years before they will alarm for replacement."
5,CO and Smoke alarm,"This was purchased as a replacement for a defective CO/smoke alarm. I tossed the old one before I realized there was a 5 year warranty on it. Being a new house I didn't get the paperwork on the installed smoke detectors, so my bad. Works exactly as it should. No more false alarms."
3,Just Under Four Years on Last Set,"They work fine and then.....poof, they decide not to work. We bought another round of them after hosting the fire department three times in two days when the last ones all decided not to work. Could have been that we did not protect them from dust in a remodel so we are giving them the benefit of the doubt. When they are working they test very well."
2,english please and install hardware,"Went to install the unit and to my surprise the instructions included in package are only in Spanish only. The package was printed in english only.I was able to find the English instructions on-line and print them out but even so, at least include the instructions in english. Also, no mounting screws or wire nuts included so I had to come up with them myself. After all the install issues the unit is working good so far."
