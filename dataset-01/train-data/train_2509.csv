1,Waste of paper,"I am an Internet sales manager with 4 years of car sales experience.First of all, this guys capitalizes on his name, and most shoppers buy this book because his name sounds like Zig Ziglar, which he is not, not even close.All this book is is a few car selling TRICKS, one-liners, and crappy attitude. And his other book Phones kills - is even worse.As a contrast - I would highly recommend For Zero To Hero, or a book that you unfortunately cannot buy here, so I am only going to mention the author initials - JV, and those in car business will sure know who I am talking about."
3,"Why is S Douglas ""Scotty"" slamming every car sales book but this one","Why is S Douglas ""Scotty"" slamming every car sales book but this one? I wonder if he actually owns all the books he has put negative reviews on? I also wonder if he works for Ziggy or maybe he is a friend of Ziegler and pushing this book for him. Ziggy does not need anyone to help him sell books. Take a look at all of S. Douglas ""Scotty"" reviews concerning car sales. He puts almost everyone of them down but praises this book. What's up with that?"
2,Mediocre,"I am new to sales, selling cars for only 7 months. This book has little new or significant material. Good for a quick read but nothing more."
4,What's the problem? Strong as death!,"This is the book I thought I was buying. Sure, it could be better inregards to the write up section. But even the authro stated that he was unsure about leading us the wrong way and that the write up is best eft to the closer. Overall, it's a 4 with strong lerans toward a 5. Now, some of the previous reviews were left by someone (maybe the author) of another competing book. Sad that he must result to this."
1,Waste of time and money,"My owner herd me using a technique used in this book and nearly fired me. After explaining to him where I learned the things I was doing and saying, he asked to see the book. He said this kind of garbage was what is wrong with the car business today. He held the book in a sales meeting and told us all if we used any of these tactics we wouldn't be working for him. Then he pulled open a box of books called Selling cars the hand book of the professional and gave each of us one and told us to read it. I haven't raed mine yet. When I do I'll let you know what I thought."
5,This Book Saved My Financial Life,"I read this book about ten years ago and it gave me the incentive and tools to get totally out of debt. Beforehand, I had massive debt and never thought I'd be able to become debt-free. I did the things this book tells you to do and about four years ago I finally did it....I paid off all my credit card, student loan, and car loan debts. I've stayed out of debt since then, with the only debt I have is my mortgage. I charge items on my credit card and pay off the balance in full each month.Debt-free is a wonderful freeing feeling and I owe it all to this book."
4,Excellent - Full of ideas that really look like they might work!,"Just started delving in to this book intently and keep leaving it in conspicuous places for hubby to see it...Have to schedule a sit down - I know that debt free is the new ""rich"" in America - I don't want to be ""rich"" but I do want to be free of the worry!"
5,Great for Little Kids,"My son loves Scooby-Doo, but would scard when he watched the cartoons. I recalled the Pup name Scooby-Doo from when I was kid and purchased this DVD for him. He loves it and doesn't have me check under the bed for monsters anymore."
2,depends on shoe size & type of shoe,I would not recommend this product to anyone who has size 9 womens or above--or who has walking shoes or hiking shoes. The spaces are too small to hold anything but sandals or some dress shoes size 8 and smaller. I ordered this thinking it would be ideal for my closet and shoe-storage issue. The product disappointed me.
5,great purchase,i bought this shoe organizer before and it ripped during moving so i needed to buy a new one i had my old one for about 3 years and it worked wonders it saves so much space and it holds so many pairs of shoes maybe not exactly 30 unless you put flats but i have about 20-25 pairs and it fits them all
1,dont waste your money,hung it on my closet door three day later the weight of the shoes the clips broke made very poorly!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Sturdy over the door shoe holder,"The fact that it holds 30 pairs of shoes is great, but I didn't realize how heavy my door then became and how it was difficult to put the shoes in and out. Very sturdy!"
1,Hate!,I has plastic hinges to hold the shoes up which i think is so stupid. It broke the next day I bought it because there were too many shoes! Seller was fast but product sucks.
1,DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!,This shoe rack did not even last for 3 weeks and it was a pain from the beginning. DURABLE????? NO WAYY!!!! The hooks that go over the door are metal but the loops that the hooks go into are PLASTIC and it just completely snapped one day. I didn't double up shoes in the slots and there were a lot of flip flops in it and how heavy are they? Don't waste your money on this product it is not durable at all. Get one with metal hooks and metal loops. I wish I could get my money back!
2,"poor construction, barely functional","There are three pieces at work here. The metal hooks that go over the door, the canvas eyelets that hold the entire canvas part below, and the plastic rings that connect the hooks with the eyelets. Those plastic rings snapped off within one day of loading the organizer half-full. I jerry rigged it so the eyelets now hang directly on the hooks. However, this strains the eyelets since they are twisted 90 degrees from their normal orientation. It's anyone guess how long this thing will last. Also the sticky tabs that are meant to keep the organizer stuck to the door are useless. Don't even put them on the door when you get the product. I'll keep using it until it falls, but I would be happier spending more for something that was tested by someone somewhere. This was never tested."
3,Great for Smaller Sized Shoes - Don't Expect Much,"I purchased this rack before for my old tiny room. It suited fine. It got rid of the clutter on the floor and made it easy to select what shoes to wear.Fast forward 10 years, my rack is used by my parents for guests when they come into the house. Still usable although I must warn if it is held by a door that is open and shut frequently this may not be the best rack. When shoes are filled up it gets quite heavy. Also with bigger size shoes, Women's size 8+ or 3""+ higher heels, the slots fits solely one shoe (taking 2 slots for a pair).I purchased this for my children's shoes and it works just fine. It's easy to put up, visible, saves on space and at $15, it beats a shoe rack."
2,Doesnt hold its wieght,"Just a warning to everyone who buys this, if you do put 30 pairs of shoes in this shoe holder that does indeed have 30 slots for 30 pairs of shoes, do not be surprised when 1 hour after hanging it, the plastic connector that hangs the product on the hooks that fit over the door snaps under the weight of all of the shoes. Honestly, this happened - one hour after I hung it up. I used 2 key rings to replace the plastic connectors which I hope will hold out but the fabric of the product itself is also tearing already and I do not know how long it is going to hold. Hopefully for a while until I can figure out something else. For under 10 bucks, I suppose you get what you pay for. Very disappointing."
4,Great,It holds 30 pairs of shoes and the price is great. Only problem is if you have big shoes you need to alternate with smaller thinner shoes to fit well.
3,Great for small feet,"The shoes in the picture must be children's shoes, I wear a women's 9, and my husband a mens 11. They don't fit in this organizer. If you squeeze them, they do, but they aren't easy to get in and out. Squeezing them in also will eventually lead to the whole thing tearing. Ive been storing rolled up t-shirts in it. Works great for this!"
2,Book would be great if it got to me in usable condition,"I'll give two stars for the book itself but the dealer in VT that I bought it from didn't describe it correctly, saying it was in ""very good"" condition, when in fact it was water damaged throughout most of the book. Totally unable to photocopy anything. Beware of sellers who misrepresent."
3,Good phone ...but horrible battery life,"Nokia 5300 is my third phone till now, I am not very crazy about phones, and I give more importance to the basic functionality of the phone rather than other features, I never used any phone apart from Nokia phones. In all other phones battery life used to be simply awesome, but for this phone I am really disappointed with the battery life, I need to charge it every other day. Overall this phone is good. no other complains."
2,"Awful phone, avoid.","After my old trustworthy motorola pebble decided to pack in a went for the Nokia 5300 not so much out of being partially impressed by it but rather that was one of the better phones on offer as part of my phone contract.In the several months I have had it is has broken several times. The screen has decided to take the image of a stained glass window, the phone itself is this ugly little fat thing that sits uncomfortably in your pocket probably the only half decent functions of this phone is a half decent camera.While the phone has tried to sell itself through having a built in MP3 player and radio option personally even if I didn't have an ipod I would rather just spend 50 on a half decent MP3 player and have a phone that is sturdy, slimline and well, functions as a phone!Cant say there is anything really to recommend about this phone. 2 stars is being kind. If only they had put out a new version of the pebble."
2,Eh,"I got this phone awhile back and replaced it fast because it kept freezing and I'd have to take the battery off to restart it. My phone recently broke and I'm back to using this one again and realizes why I avoided it in the first place.Picture Messaging - never works, always says network failureText Messaging - it doesnt seem to save new words so its quite annoying to have to type a frequently used word that it does not recognizeCalls - good. no problems here.Overall - sometimes the phone itself just freezes and the option to switch off doesnt allow you to choose it."
2,Hello? Can you hear me?,I like how this phone looks and the menu is easy enough but that is about it. It works so I guess that's a plus as well? This is the first phone I have had where everyone I talk to has a problem hearing me. Apparently it gets a ton of background noise. I cannot really rely on this phone for any important/business phone calls. I'm thinking of going back to my old freebie Nokia candy bar phone for now.Bottom line: keep looking.
3,Back cover of phone is not covered by warranty.,"Just to let anyone who is interested in this phone...the back cover is not covered by your warranty with T-mobile. So, if you just happen to lose it or break it, T-mobile will send you everything else (the phone itself, charger, etc), but without the back cover. Don't ask me why they don't cover it--I thought that was pretty weird b/c without the back cover, the phone is nothing! The battery will fall off! Also, the manufacturer doesn't carry it either so, thank goodness for ebay! My phone is functional again! The guy from Nokia I talked to said that I should have called them first (the manufacturer)to repair it, b/c they replace everything, but check first anyways before sending your stuff to them.The phone itself has been good to me though, but I do wish it was a little bit slimmer. T-mobile customer service is questionable though."
4,great phone overall--speaker problem,"I have had my phone for close to a year now. I traded in from the Razr to this phone because I was told it has a better signal that it's motorola counterpart. Not the Razr but the product with a lot of the same to offer.The only complaint I have at all is my speaker doesn't work properly which results in missing calls or not able to use the speakerphone.Aside from that, this phone is awesome!"
4,Wished The Voice Recorder Had More Than A Minute,"I just received the Nokia 5300 a few days ago. One thing I found out was that the voice recorder could not record more than one minute. It looks like it can, but after talking to Nokia twice over the phone, recording more than a minute was not available for this phone. Didn't make sense to me that you can choose the miniSD card to put your voice recordings on, and not be able to record more than a minute. Plus, you can record while talking on the phone - but only for one minute!Everything else about this phone is great! I do highly recommend reading the pro's and cons of other reviewers. I have a Microsoft Vista laptop and it worked great with it - for those wondering if it will work with Vista."
2,Very Poor Product!,"I Bought the product based on the C-net review which gave it he highest rating. From the start the phone felt extremely cheap. I also had a terrible time trying to get the phone to sync with my Mac. Nobody at Nokia seems to realize that there are alternative platforms out there. I had to spend ten bucks on a third party program, so I could get isync to work with the 5300. I finally returned it when I found out there is a next gen version of the 5300 that was better in every way. When I was on with t-mobile to return the phone, the Mic on the 5300 stopped working. I'm just glad I was able to return it in time."
1,The worst phone ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this phone three months ago and had no problems with it until just recently. I noticed a scratch on it, which turned into a crack, which became bigger. The screen was still visible until the next day. It then became black and could not see anything. I would not recommend this phone to anybody."
1,Great phone if you are 15,"I got this phone cause I thought it would be a nice little phone. Wrong. Yes it plays songs. Yes it is little. Too little!!!! This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers. The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK! It is hard to use. I returned the phone after only 2 DAYS! I got the Samsung T629. TOTALLY better. Does almost everything the Nokia does, but is better, looks better performs much better. If you are a teenager this phone may be good for you. The Samsung even sounds better. Get the Samsung, same price more phone."
5,Rockin' out with The Stereo,"The bastard child of Rory from The Impossibles and Jamie Wolfard from Animal Chin, The Stereo provides a softer sound (and a definte departure from ska) than either band but with beefed guitars and emo-esque melodic vocals, it's an experience all of it's own. This particular album (the stereo's third) is just Jamie rockin' out, Rory having departed by this time, but that just makes the album all the more killer. It's definetly time to stop listening to the radio and pick up The Stereo."
3,umm...no,"while this book was interesting in that the heroine already had a disabled brother, i found it to be lacking in depth. It wasn't bad, exactly. I just wanted more. If you like imperfect heroes, check listmania esp. melbabe's two lists for some good stories. This one just lacked that certain something."
4,A little big.,Love this soft sided crown. It's just quite a bit big for my 2 year old. Hoping it will be usabl-y big in the near future.
3,Must have Garter belt,Does provide compression but is useless unless you have something to hold them up. There are no silicone bands or any other kind of band to keep them from falling down.
2,A rather dull story!,While the acting of the young lady is good but the story with the priest havinglittle regard for this teenager leaves something to be desired. Story is notinteresting enough and always around the same subject plus the ending is alsonot conclusive. Would not see it again or recommend it.
3,Jarring transitions,"I'll be back to give 5 stars to the DVD of the film when it's released. The movie is terrific, and my 7-year-old and I were mesmerized. But we're not as positive about this soundtrack. It's great if you want a recap of the music in the movie. Also great if you're unfamiliar with jazz and dance music of the last century and need a sampler. But if you want to just sit and listen, this may not be the album for you. The leaps from big band to salsa to tango to whatever are startling; you might prefer recordings that stick to a single genre. I also don't think the sound engineering on this album was that crisp; the music is sometimes pretty muddy. Follow the names of the performers you see here and explore their other recordings. There's a ton of great stuff out there."
3,Left out an important song,"The soundtrack is decent however as one of the reviewers said, this cd has left out one of the best songs - ""Corazon de Acero."" This is the wonderful dancing duo - Wilson and Elsamey's song for the Rhumba."
4,Excellent Music,"The selections on this CD are great. It provides you with a mixture of great music. You can play the entire CD and have yourself a party. Swing, rumba, merengue, tango, foxtrot its all there. Enjoy"
5,The Best CD Ever!,"I think the soundtrack is awsome! my favorite song is El Bonche Menea because I get 2 do all of my favorite latin dances on that song! I also liked the movie mad hot ballroom. I am an indigo fan,so if your not then don't read the rest of this message.I like Scarlyn,Karina,Jatnna,Elsamelys,and my baby Joshua Duran(HE IS SOOO FINE!)you should get the movie! in stores now. BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Mad Hot Ballroom Sound Track,"The music on this CD was some of the best Ballroom and Merengue music that I have ever heard. I loved the Movie ""Mad hot Ballroom"" and just had to own the music tracks from this movie. Every Grade school teacher in America should watch ""Mad Hot Ballroom""."
1,RIP OFF!,Price per candy bar after shipping more expensive than buying in a store. A real rip off and although the candy is great the price is ridiculous!
4,Great pictures of tools,"This is a really nice book for those interested in fine tools. I was hoping to find information on how they were made. If you are a toolmaker, this book really does not include any drawings, sizes or build methods. If you are just looking for a nice historical record of works of art in tools - this is the book to get. Great pictures of Paul Hamler's miniature tools for those interested in his work too."
2,Pretty but not accurate,"This is a beautifully photographed book of fine tools. Appart from the fact that all such picture books these days have a pungent chemical odor, one could hardly fault the photographic excelence of this book. Nagyszalanczy is an experienced woodworker, but it was dismaying to me that the text is full of factual erors. Most noticeably in the Japanese tool section, where it is clear that basic priciples are a mystery. I don't know how it got by the editors at Taunton Press."
5,great guy gift,"For all the woodworkers on your Christmas List - or birthday list - or whatever. This is a TERRIFIC book, beautifully photographed, intelligent text, and very reasonably priced for the value. Check it out!"
5,love the 80's,Love the band King. I was a big fan in the 80's and I still am.Any King fans please email me at sdm0303@yahoo.com
5,good read,"a very interesting book, although wether they are really a dzog chen lineage has been open to debate. nevertheless you can get a lot out of this book."
2,Defective dvd don't buy,This dvd will only play the first short. There are no links to get to the other movies. The main menu only goes to one movie.
4,Quantum Theory in Plain Language,"A book devoted to the development of quantum theory, Jim Baggott gives readers a much-desired rest from the mathematical rigidity of the subject. This book is fun, pleasant, and easy to read. It introduces the fundamental and key ideas of quantum theory through clever, to-the-point analogies and diagrams. Many physical chemistry students, or just science audience, will welcome this plain approach of the subject. Landmark concepts such as operators, postulates, Pauli principle, Bohr-Einstein debate and Bell's theorem are covered with a lucid and thoughtful account."
5,Read this before taking undergraduate quantum mechanics.,"This book prepares the physics major for quantum. The author is honest about the debate over the meaning of quantum theory, something that most text books ignore. The introduction to the mathematics of quantum mechanics is extremely helpful. If you read this before taking the course, you might actually understand the math on the board! Just remember the quote from Richard Feynman, ""...I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."""
4,The Glory Road by Fern Jones,Absolutely great! Her's is an amazing story. She should have been a star.....
4,Very enjoyable,"Queenisha ""Queenie"" Sutton was a beautiful and very successful woman. She did whatever was needed to get what she wanted. That included snaring handsome Zeke Washington! While at a charity fund-raiser Zeke was put up for auction. Winner ""purchased"" him for a single night. Queenie was determined to make him HER man! She even went to her best friend, Poetta, who put a ""voodoo hex"" on Zeke. But Queenie got a lot more than she ever expected!Meanwhile, Raymondo (a co-worker) was out to make Queenie HIS woman. But Queenie wanted no part of him! As for Poetta, she was not just a side-line character. Poetta had her own trouble. She was in love with a married man. But the man dropped dead when her love spell went wrong!If you like ""sister-hood"" then this book is for you! Filled with humor and a sassy wit, this story was easy to like. Well written characters that will keep you reading."
5,Saludos Amigos / Three Caballeros,"Fun and adventures travel tale.In all the Donald Duck and Goofy, one can definitely see the art work from 'Fantasia' and other classics. The unique characters to these Jose Carioca and Panchito would make for great characters to bring back. The Aracuan Bird as a running joke and zany antics adds dimension and color. There is even Sterling Holloway in yet another voice role. So, feature length over all, but made up of a variety of shorts."
4,Looks like a good deal,"I always enjoyed ""Three Caballeros"" but understand why Disney animation purists may be disoriented or disappointed by it. I just ordered the disc and will revise this review after watching it. Too bad it doesn't include ""Blame It on the Samba"" (1948), starring Donald and Jose. As for Donald's chasing skirt, so did the cherubic Harpo in early Marx Brothers movies. It was considered I think disarmingly spontaneous behavior in more innocent times. Maybe for that reason, it was an age when women slapped men more than they do now. And kicked dogs too, I suppose."
4,Glad to have this,"I am glad to have this two film DVD. I see it as historical mostly. The US government was trying to build good relationships with Latin America during WWII and sent Disney down there to work up films to help make us ""good neighbors."" Much of that story, the surface parts can be seen in Saludos Amigos and the extra features. A little known part of our history and a keeper for that reason.In addition I like some of the older cartoon art and I think for my tastes some of the best is in here, in particular in the last 2/3 or so of Three Caballeros. I would keep it for these scenes alone.But this is mostly of historical interest to me and well worth watching from that perspective."
5,Enhances enjoyment of the novels,"Though this book is mainly geared towards the role-playing game series, it contains such a wealth of information on Krynn and its inhabitants that it only helps the reader appreciate the novels even more. It is well written, thorough, and enjoyable."
4,Quick and Easy,"Great shape for a used book, and awesome. Everything you need to know about Krynn post WoTL."
5,No te lo puedes perder,"Hace unos dias estuve en Costa Rica y compre este libro, esta simplemente exelente!, cuando lo empiezas a leer cuesta cerrarlo para pasar a hacer otra cosa, no te lo puedes perder, he reido, pero creo que he llorado mas, es increible imaginarse que estos hombres pasaron por martirios como los descritos y algunos siendo inocentes... si tienes la oportunidad, leelo!!!"
5,My Brother My Executioner,pls give me the novel analysis of the novel of Sionil Jose My Brother My Executioner. The summary of it the setting the plot the theme the characters the summary of each chapter
3,Understanding the Philippines and Me,"I read these books out of order, but I enjoyed both. I had to start the Pretenders twice because I was so attached to the character of Tony that it hurt to see his life go out of control and I could not bear to see how things would get worse. Tony loses his happy life as an educator as he is unable to tell his wealthy in-laws ""no"".Mass made me want to visit Tondo so I could understand Pinoy slums. I was also attached to the characters in this book and reading was slow as I compared my life's decisions to that of each character.The writing can be ""preaching"", but if you can get by that these books will help understand the Philippines and yourself."
4,Ingram's Wes Bio is informative,"I liked the bio of Wes Montgomery by Adrian Ingram. I have been listening to Wes since the age of 13, (1965), and he is definitely one of the reasons I've played guitar for the past 40+ years. Ingram's take on Wes fills in many spaces about his life and career. The format of the book is kind of mix and match... but it still delivers on quantity of info. The pictures are few and the quality sometimes lacking, but for sheer bang for your buck this book is a Wes lovefest! I already knew a lot about the music of Montgomery, Ingram shares info about his origins that you don't find in most sources. The discography, instrument/amp info, insider stuff on the recording sessions all give this book a unique view of Wes. I recommend this to anyone who wants tolearn more about the man and his music. I don't think the definitive book about him has been written yet. How about a bio-pic ala Ray?"
4,Hard Work,"Ingram made a very hard work to bring all Wes' fans a in-deep sight of wes' life and career. Here you can find the entire discography (very precise) of a great jazz guitarist.This book gave me the opportunity to buy only the right cds, leaving out all commercial collections. Not many photos, but good ones."
2,This Giant deserves more!,"Okay, mr. Ingram loves Wes and his music, that much is clear. And it is good to know how this guitar giant lived his (much to) short live. I like the kind way Ingram describes the period of Wes's life when he sold his soul to commerce. At least that is the way the 'real' jazz connoisseurs think of it. Ingram's story puts this perod in a different perspective. What I don't like is the flimsy looks of this book: poor type, poor print and very poor illustrations. Pitty, this could have been a good book."
2,Save your money,This book was a let down for me. The print quality was poor and as biography books go this was the worst I have ever read. This book has no depth and leaves you unsatisfied after reading it. A very quick read. Youcan read the whole book in less than two hours. A great guitarist like Wes Montgomery desires a decent biography on his life. Not this shallow attempt. A couple good pictures of Wes though.
5,Great song from a great album!!!,"dont listen to those two nimrods!! this song ""she wants to move"" is a great song with a great beat and is a club classic!buy the single or just buy the album""fly or die"" u wont regret it!"
1,dated&dry,"this cut reminds me of a outtake that didn't make the Jacksons ""Victory"" Album.this cut is flat&just is layered with one to many ideas for it's own good."
3,Teddy Bear Treasury,"If you are a teddy bear person this is an excellent book to have. It has a variety of teddy bears in several sizes and dressed for all occassions. The designs are in color and are easy to use. However, the book has only teddy bears and many of the designs are too large to use for anything other than wall hangings or on afghan's. Some of the designs have appeared in other books. The designs are well shaded meaning you may use up to 30 or more colors. These are not designs that could be finished easily in an afternoon. This book is for the more experienced cross stitcher."
1,"Good idea, poor implementation.","I have rsi bad enough that I'm trying to change careers. I had hoped that this mouse might be helpful in easing some of the tension; however, it isn't precise enough for efficiently clicking items on my desktop and it tends to drift aimlessly to one side even if mouse if moved towards opposite side. Also the grip is a bit awkward to use it in the air you have to depress the trigger any time you want to use the mouse, which for me is exactly the type repetetive motion I'm trying to avoid. This effectively makes it useless to me as a mouse. Hopefully technology and implimentation will catch up with the idea."
2,"Cool concept, poor quality control.","This item is a great idea, and when it works properly, it is very smooth and intuitive. The problem is that the mouse has a poor connection with the battery or the battery is messed up. I dont know, but I cannot get it to work but for a few moments and then I have to take off the battery and reattach it. I talked to tech support, and we could not get it resolved, so they issued a product replacement form. The product has a two year warranty, so that's not a real problem. I am sure we'll get it fixed, but I just wish they would have had a closer handle on quality control. And unlike bigger electronics companies, they do not send you a UPS label. So returning the product is at my cost."
1,DO NOT BUY GO MOUSE,"I have the go mouse and keyboard. the keyboard works great, but the mouse only works intermittently. I returned the first one after a couple weeks because I thoght it was defective. it would work fine for a while and then not, the second one worked fine for awhile and then the same problems, the buttons had no response etc., so I bought a second one because I figured I needed one while the original was being sent back for repair or replacement again., the new one also has similar problems from the get go. it seems like it will establish connection for awhile and the totally intermittent, now I have $120.00 worth of 2 junk Gyration GO mouse. I beleive it is crappy driver or crappy design. Do NOT BUY!!"
5,Really good service,I receive all the seeds on time with instructions inside how to work with them.The seeds are growing almost all of them without problems.
3,a basic book on study skills for the college or advanced high school student,"This is a basic book on study skills.This book is aimed at the advanced high school or college audience. It assumes the student is engaged and motivated.It is somewhat dated and did not cover some of the 'modern' challenges that a student might face such as various issues or needs in light of computers and other digital devices.I attempted to adapt this book to remedial ninth grade students with little success. It is written for the advanced student so please know this will not be an appropriate pick for most middle school or 'struggling' high school students. This book would not be a helpful book if your student has ADHD or learning disabilities. I only rated it three of five stars because my class did not find it helpful, but you would if you are a bit more advanced than my particular students were."
4,Insightful,This book is insightful in a very basic way. It is easy to understand and for those who are honestly looking to improve their attitude towards life this book will make you see things more clearly. If you do the work and make some changes it will bring joy.
4,High School Chemistry Tutor (High School Tutors),Our 15 yr old son thinks this is a good supplement to his high school text book. It gives in depth reviews of the problems. May offer some helpfull insite that the teacher didn't review in class.
3,"Innovative Story, Terrible Design","First of all, who on earth thought to do a verticle reading, hard bound book? It's really a poor decision. This is my first P.K. Dick story. I thought the plot was innovative and well laid out for the most part, but found the exposition very lacking! There is little to no background on the characters- it was more like a screenplay than a typical short story. It was a very easy read. I was not a great fan of the movie- so this (along with the ridiculous format) probably clouded my enjoyment of the book. I admire his imagination and will defintely read more.Julie"
5,Great product,Constipated for yrs....only product I have found to help. Doctors have tried everything for mr. I will now tell THEM what they need to tell their patients!
5,Thanks for speedy service.,Fiber smart is much better than those flavored products it is a combination of several things the body need for the digestive tract. I think it's a source of fiber for anyone to take it is great for the digestive tract.
2,Lightweight overview of domestic violence practices,"A sadly lightweight overview of domestic violence procedures in the U.S. and Canada. Interesting reading for anyone who wants some indication of what's being done in the field but for any serious academic use this comes off as lacking. No index, not enough referencing and non-academic, may be of interest as a starting point but could have been much better."
3,An Expert of Aristotle Eludicates Rand in 100 pages!,One of the world's foremost experts on Aristotle eludciates Ayn Rand's philosophy: Objectivism. Marred by some errors.For a complete systematic presentation of Ayn Rand's philosophy get yourself a copy of Dr. Leonard Peikoff's *Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand.* It is generally the book that other authors who write books on Ayn Rand get their information on Objectivism and Ayn Rand's philosophy from.
1,Very Hard to Read,I found it extremely difficult to get through each page. This is a very poorly written book.
5,great value,Bought this bag along with smaller one for less than other sites wanted for one bag. Good quality as always with DeWalt products.
3,"some great songs, some very discordant","I love the harmonic sound of bassa nova and the rythmic grooves of much electronica. I had heard someone playing this CD at the park and decided to get it because what I heard sounded so good. There are a lot of good songs on this CD, but there are some that are really discordant that I can't listen to. The voice of the female vocalist can be a bit grating at times."
1,Tax liens aren't all that,"I learned about tax liens from the Rich Dad series and when I read some of the information provided in this book, the 50% returns clearly shows that it is just part of the hype. Really you won't get up to 50% returns, with the industry average hovering around 8-9%. To the book's credit, it does state that you ""could"" go up to 50% or more not necessarily that you will."
3,Sam's Opinion,"Book was fine, but it still doesn't show how to actually buy Tax Liens. It just provides information that may help you learn to fundamentals."
2,"Some useful details, but ...","... the text is written in an informal conversational style targetting an average 8th grade student. If you want something that can fill its pages with solid substance, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if taxes and legal jargon intimidates you, the baby-talk tone of this book is for you."
2,"Too small, don't buy.","Too small, my wife can't do much with it, and it takes a lot of effort for me to use it. Won't buy again."
2,Well made but poorly designed.,"This nut cracker is designed so that nuts (like Hazelnuts) don't fit into ether the front jaws or the rear ones well. The front jaws when squeezed with send parts of the nut flying across the room and often smash the meat of the nut. The second set of jaws,while larger, require squeezing the handles to a point where they are nearly completely closed in your hand, not taking advantage of the larger hand muscles to crack them. Twice I have pinched the fatty part of my hand below the thumb trying to crack them.There is just not good leverage in the tool to crack the nuts. My wife and granddaughter have given up on it and it now lies in the drawer of other useless gadgets.Also, wider handles and/or rubber grips may have helped considerably."
1,Masquerade,"Wanting an introductory overview to C. G. Jung and his work, and reading the editorial reviews that Mr. McLynn has presented an objective and clear account of them, I eagerly picked up this biography, but was disappointed to find it a tendentious polemic relentlessly and repetitively attacking Jung (and, by the way, I am not a ""Jungian""), dwelling at unnecessary length on the Freud-Jung relationship and insufficiently on Jung's influence as an original thinker of the XXc, and most signally, failing to present any sort of precis of Jung's seminal ideas that would be helpful to the general reader. Don't bother with this one: wait for a better biography, something on the lines of Peter Gay's Freud: a Life for Our Time."
5,Best biography of Jung so far,"McLynn tackles the controversial issues in Jung head on, such as his mistresses and attitude to women,his relationship with Freud,alleged National Socialist sympathies before the War and anti-Semitism.Jung does not always appear in the best light,but McLynn backs his comments with evidence.One-eyed Jungians may not be amused, but this biography presents a wealth of information and should not be missed by anyone interested in Jung."
3,Flawed though Interesting Biography,"On the positive side, this book contains a lot of interesting information about Jung especially from a personal point of view. Contemporary accounts are presented and where there are conflicting stories the author at least mentioned all the possibilities. Almost the entire first half of the book deals with Jung's interaction with Freud. It is clear that the author prefers Freud. This is also the section of the book were the author allows himself to subjectively dismiss Jungian ideas. The rest of the book is more neutral in analysis though the picture painted is not an attractive one. But Jung may not have been the most likable person. To me the greatest flaw of the work was that I still did not have an appreciation of what made Jung as popular as he was and still is? The book is readable with some interesting information and views but it cannot be the only biography of Jung you read."
1,A harsh drag over Freudian coals....,"A harsh drag over Freudian coals. Misses Jung entirely. Breaks down everything Jung did to alleged neurosis via his mother or his libido. A few interesting points I hadn't read elsewhere, but overall a waste of my time. Exhibits little, if any, understanding of the depth and immensity of Jung's work. Quite the hatchet job. Try Bair's or Wehr's biographies instead."
1,the last page causes a sigh of relief,"McLynn doesn't like Jung ideas. Not a problem, really, but then why write a book about him? So the book crawls slowly, unhappily amassing all negative gossip about Jung, leaving the reader ( as probably also it did to the writer), miserable, exhausted, untill, at last the book ends, and a sigh of relief is impossible to avoid. Was this really necessary? Was this a paid, imposed job? This is really a pathography, a subgenre of our sick postmodern times, and I hope that these kind of people never go so far as the write a new life of Christ."
2,Child's Health Record book,This book wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a book that had blank spots for me to fill in medical records and dr. visits and yearly stats for my child. This book does have places to do that but also pages of information that I didn't want. The pages were the very old brown tinted pages and felt like they might disenegrate in 20 years when my child will be on her own and need her medical records. But it was the only one of this kind that I could find so it'l do until I find a better one.
1,Don't buy it,This book is over 10 years old so very outdated. Not worth buying at all. Very disappointed.
1,Out of Date!,"I ordered this book to track my newborn's immunizations. Upon receiving the book, I realized that the section for tracking these does not include the current vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC, but rather only select ones. I would not waste money on a book that is not up to date!"
3,A Wordless Karoake,Half the songs are wordless. Doesn't make sense. However the other songs were good and my grandaughter enjoyed them.
1,cheap knock off,"Well its a nice looking unit,it was easy to install,but after driving My Truck I don't care for the vibrating and dissorted mirror.If I didn't need a mirror right now I would probably send it back for refund."
4,very good book on mexican witchcraft,"This book uses visualization techniques and some spellcraft in order to gain power. The methods are not what you would usually find in wiccan books. For example one visualizes the virgin mary under various colors of dress and emotions in order to get certain powers. Other saints are visualized in the same way. I would have given this book a ten, but the author then writes that there are certain ""secrets"" that cannot be told in the book. This is the one flaw in the book and I must say in a few other books on the occult. I feel I'm being sold short. Fortunately, a careful reading of the book will show that the ""secrets"" can be gained through the visualization methods the author describes. You have to read between the lines to know this though. Given this, the book is a very good text on mexican wicca."
4,A perfectly serviceable entry in a fine series.,"This was a perfectly serviceable entry in a fine series; it is neither the best nor the worst of the lot. This is true both in terms of the quality of the stories in it, and in terms of the smoothness of the editing. One item of note is that it contains the (allegedly) final story in the ""Cynthia, Witch of Syracuse"" series by Dorothy J. Heydt, which I've always been quite fond of and which is apparently being (has been by now?) collected into a book in its own right. I'll have to look for it."
3,Captures a bygone time,"Most journalists in the Soviet days wrote about Moscow, while Leningrad remained a largely uncovered backwater despite its tsarist glory. This book is far from perfect, but Robinson was a language student in the tsars' capital and wrote perhaps the only Soviet-era Western book about a foreigner's experience in that city."
3,very short tape,I purchased this tape along with the advance exercise tape and discovered that both tapes could have been combined and still have room to spare. The demonstration is short and you would probably have to pause and do the exercise then restart. The advanced tape actually was just a sales pitch to purchased some of her product.The first tape said you will not need any creams yet on the second tape after a very very short example of some exercises you are introduced to her product line
3,old School,"As you know Rosa Guy is an author, from back in the day, I enjoyed the booka lot, but was a little put out with the dialect. I don't like readingwith accents, It was well written, started off a little slow, but picked upat the end, but don't forget this book is for young adults."
1,Really Annoyed,"The end of the pump handle broke off the first time I tried to use it. The one time we got it to work it went about 3 inches into the air. The pump's seal did not work at all after that. Not worth the money to send it back, but hoping to warn others. I should have read the reviews before I bought it..."
1,Disappointment,The pump was broken right out of the package so you could not pressurize the rocket.Very disappointed as I had a lot of fun with this toy when I was a kid.
2,Bad Sample - I used others that worked well,The one I bought had a bad seal and it went about 3 feet in the air - much to the disappointment of my son and I. I have other models before and they worked well.It wasnt worth the hassle to send backQuality was poor.
2,leaky seals,Either the product delivered is old OR the seals do not prevent water-air leaks very well. It works well sporadically with a great deal of care and attention. I had a toy like this when I was a child. It worked much better then.
2,Lots of Plastic,Doesn't last long before the plastic cracks and you're washing yourself. More metal on the pressure points would of made for a better product.
2,bad & bored,This buy was an silly mistake!!The acting of the Stars of this picture was bad like a TV Soap-opera.The story is boring.You need some western-action?Look at Bonanza.
1,Kill me now,"After reading The Gospel Of The Flying Spaghetti Monster last year, I expected this book to be more irreverent fun based around the whole FSM concept.How wrong can one person be?I managed to get through roughly half of the book and that was only because I couldn't find a newspaper at work to read instead. The author has taken the fun out of the FSM and my impression is that he is just trying to cash in on Bobby Henderson's creation without making much of an effort other than putting the words Flying Spaghetti Monster through a program that creates anagrams.It's garbage and not worth the effort of shelling out your hard earned bucks. If you have already bought it, use it to prop open a door or stick it in the bathroom for when you run out of toilet paper."
1,Went to lulu...,"...and clicked on the preview this book link. I only got a 7 page pdf (so if it's half the book the whole book is 14 pages?) that had a different title to the book. Not much of a preview.I still think it's poor form to publish this book at the same time as Bobby Henderson's. This is his baby, and he should be the one profiting from it."
5,Sooo Many Things to Find!,"My 2.5 year old is now very interested in details, so when I saw the well-populated photographs in this book I knew we had to have it. We take it on outings and pull it out when she needs a quiet activity. Both she and her older sister pore over the illustrations (see if you can find the Scotty dog on a bead bracelet) and they even practice counting the items in the photos! This is a sturdy book with illustrations that will hold the interest of even busy youngsters."
2,Odd little book,"I ordered this for my 18 month old grand daughter - it had a good rating.Pros:Well made and durable.Lots of pages, and good size for little hands.Easily handled by a toddler.Cons:Very obscure and odd pictures.The poem is also a little odd.The pictures of the clowns are downright scary - and I've always wondered why some kids were afraid of clowns!Some of the pictures are a bit on the ""dark"" side.The book is just ""ok"" in my opinion. We are trying to teach recognition of items in pictures, so it is difficult when the pictures include things like a board game piece, dice, a cake topper, and other obscure items. It is a very odd book. Maybe this is supposed to be ""artsy"" or something - it's lost on me!If I had picked this book up in a bookstore, I would not have purchased it."
4,"Nice, but not as good as the others","This is a cute book, but not as engaging to my daugther and me as the others in both rhyme and picture. She liked looking at the bunnies at first but that quickly grew old."
4,Exciting debut,"Escapee is a breath of fresh air in a market of Patricia Cornwells and John Grishams. Not unlike Sherwood Anderson's classic, Winesburg, Ohio, Poland's collection is a focused study of small town life. The writer empathizes with his characters even as he unveils the tricks they play on each other, and sometimes themselves, in order to survive.The strongest piece is ""Moshe's Minyan,"" a moving exchange between a young man home from World War II and his kindly Jewish employer. The only criticism is that some of the endings are a bit abrupt. Excellent dialogue and details."
4,Simple purchase with no problems,The Reliance power cord was of high quality and was what I expected. It was shipped in a reasonable time frame. The price was average. I would purchase again from Reliance / Amazon.
2,When will something happen?,What is taking so long to ship? Do i need to buy somewhere else? I would appreciate some action within the week!!!
5,worked as needed,Good product and I would say anyone would be happy with this. Make sure you have the right length not to much or not to little
5,Impressive,"Received my power cord today 7.20.12, very impressive, very well made, 10' was the perfect length, way better than what I was expecting! GREAT PRICE!!!! was worth the wait to get the free shipping, the power cord was far less $$$$ than what everyone else was selling locally, GOTTA LOVE AMAZON AND THERE SELLERS :-)"
5,Generator Power Cord,"Excellent Quality Product for a reasonable price delivered very quickly exceeding all expectations. Product maked it very convenient to tie-in any Standard 230/120V, 5000 to 7500 Watt Emergency Generator to properly wired and equipped emergency panelboard permanently hard wired to exterior weatherproof outlet box located within 10 feet of portable generator location.Reliance Controls PC3010 10-Feet 30-Amp L14-30 Generator Power Cord for up to 7500-Watt Generators"
5,Excellent Gold Chain,"I was a little hesitant to order this chain because it was so inexpensive, but I went ahead and was wonderfully surprised! The quality was better than most department stores and the price was more like sterling sliver than white gold. I'm very pleased and will continue to order from this company!!"
5,Excellent Album,"I've also lived in Puerto Rico during that time, listening to SAGA on Alfa Rock 106. I remember buying this album when it first came out; to date, I still have the first three albums in excellent condition. The whole album is excellent.The solo in the song ""Humble Stance"" between keyboard player and guitarist and then syncronizing at end of the solo is jaw-dropping. Let's not forget the song ""Tired World"" with another incredible guitar solo.If you like Yes, Kansas or anything Prog, this band and this album should be in your music library."
4,Exellent first Album.,When this album came out they were playing the bar scene in southern Ontario.I was blown away by the music! the bass player and the original keyboard player were previously in a band called flood. the guitarist in this band has gotten better over the years but his playing on this album is incredable! One of the best guitarists to come out of canada. No Lenny Breau but better than alex liefson( a great guitarist in his own rite) If you never heard these lads then check them out. You'll be glad you did!
3,"Remastered very well, but what about the cover.","Ok Saga Fans, the remaster of this album is definately better than the polygram version I had which also had no lyrics or liner notes or band photos. All the photos are nice and I like this remaster a lot. Problem is that my cover art on my Polygram version has more color and detail. So who got lazy in the art dept. Its not sharp and the color is really flat. Other than that this is a good album. Not my favorite saga album, they were still getting better at this point. Good outing and good remaster."
5,One of Saga's Very Best!!!!,"I am a bassplayer of 40 years and fell in love with this group from ""Day One""! I had the pleasure of seeing them in person while in Vancouver, BC in the mid 80's well after their first few releases. They are a tight,musical savvy, and electrifying group. Their other releases are tremendous also. Check them out!!Danny@ Mdbassman"
1,Big Rip Off,Don't waste your $10 buying this one-page sketch. I could have gotten the same information from Wikipedia for free.
4,"Funny and Intelligent, but a bit rushed","Larry Gonick's Cartoon History of the Universe III, is a wonderful read. His humor is sharper than ever, or perhaps humanity just got more ridiculous with age. Whatever the reason it's still the most amusing history book you'll ever read. This book unfortunately does feel a bit rushed. Plenty of time is given to the rise of Islam and the decline of the Byzantine/""Roman"" Empire, while some other events in Southeast Asia were overlooked as is history in North and South America (however some South American history is covered in the next volume,The Cartoon History of the Modern World Part 1: From Columbus to the U.S. Constitution (Pt. 1)). However, that's really a minor complaint, as Gonick crams nearly 800 years of world history in 300 pages and for the most part does a damn fine job. So for any history buffs, comic book fans, or pseudo intellectuals consider this book a must own."
5,History done right!,"In an attempt to reverse Hegel's quip that we learn nothing from the study of History Larry Gonick has the antidote: His Cartoon History series. Here is a perfect way to not only learn history, but enjoy it like you've never done in a classroom; a good meal for the brain ,it will stick to your grey matter."
4,"Very good, but filtered through modern perceptions","The _Cartoon History of the Universe_ is a good outline, on the whole, of the sweep of human history (and pre-human pre-history). For a quick newbie-friendly introduction, it's hard to beat.About the only nit I can pick is the way Gonick insists on portraying ancient and medieval people as shocked at, or guilted out about, slavery. Back before machines, you _had_ slaves or _were_ slaves (or the equivalent)...there was no third choice. Slave-trading was a perfectly respectable trade for a very long time, until the West decided to end it."
1,A Big Disappointment,"The author's insipid attempt to sell her hiking trail guide as a book of haunting tales is insulting to the educated mind. The book is a dud, a sham, and I wish I could get my money back. Even the few interesting supernatural stories are made bland by her lack of style. Take my advice... if you are looking for a genuine book on the paranormal and the occult, do not waste your time or money on Andrea Lankford's Haunted Hikes. It is just a trail guide."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"It turns out that this is a reprint of a late 19-century history of Bohemia. It reflects strong likes and dislikes, some of which appear somewhat dated more than a century later. In addition, it's annoying that some pages are copied illegibly and others are not included at all."
3,"Repetitious, but bass so strong will cause your walls to shake","And it sounds even better in an elaborate car system. The windows in my vehicle were vibrating constantly featuring an incredibly deep bass response - dayum! I have to agree that even though the whole album is quite good, it is repetitious. I thought the disc had started over at one point, but it was actually a different, ""new"" track."
4,"Everyone will ask ""Who is this band?""","It takes a few minutes for the title track to really kick into the grove, but when it does, hold on. The recording quality has a lot to do with the ambience of this CD. It's a bit of a rough take, but it adds to the purity of the sound. Home made instruments being played on the street. If it was squeaky clean, it wouldn't be as good.When I playthis CD, and it must be loud, everyone will ask, ""who is this group?""Check it out."
5,AWESOME,"I AM ALWAYS INTERESTED IN DISCOVERING NEW AND DIFFERENT SOUNDS IN WORLD MUSIC, AND WHEN I PICKED THIS CD UP, I HIT THE JACKPOT! THIS IS WEST AFRICAN MUSIC, FROM THE AREA AROUND THE BORDER OF THE CONGO AND ANGOLA, AND IT IS ENHANCED BY ELECTRONIC AMPLIFICATION, WHICH WAS MADE FROM SPARE CAR PARTS, AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS AS WELL. A LOT OF CHANTING, CALL AND RESPONSE, DISTORTION, COMPLEX PERCUSSION RHYTHMS AND ELECTRONIC FINGER PIANO (IKEMBE), IT REALLY IS AN AMAZING EFFORT. YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD THE IKEMBE PLAYED LIKE THIS, OR SOUND LIKE THIS."
2,Review of B&W slip-on lens cap for slim-line filter,I am a big fan of B&W filters--they are the best. But these slip-on lens caps are useless; they fall off all the time. I wish B&W would make a better lens cap for their slim-line filters.
1,CRAPPY CRAPPY CRAPPY,"Better to buy the 80mm cap available from B&H; photo. This piece of crap will never stay on even B&W;'s own filters. After buying a $200+ filter that can't take a normal cap because it has no threads, I would expect that B&W; would make a decent push on cap--not so. Do not buy this. B&H; photo sells a nice push on cap, the 80mm works for me, but I have heard the 79mm may be even better (but I have not confirmed this).I bought the Kaiser 80mm PUSH-ON LENS CAP at B&H; and it is much better."
1,Cap is useless,"You can hardly touch the lens, let alone store it with this cap on. I'm not sure what i'm going to do because there doesn't seem to be an alternative.I'm >< close to breaking out the duct tape and a rubber band."
5,Complete Guide,"I have an eighth grader that has been helped, and will continue to be helped, by this comprehensive guide for pitchers. It is a book that can be read cover to cover, or used as a reference book where you just take the information that is needed at the moment. Either way, the information is presented in a concise yet complete way. I highly recommend this guide."
2,Outdated,"Some useful information, but these are techniques taught decades ago. Some f the ideas are no longer taught. Pursue other options"
4,Step by Step Guide to transform imagination into reality,"Step by step instructions help your budding young artist transform imagination into reality on paper. From organizing materials to tweaking the drawing with your own personal style, DRAW Magical Fantasies provides easy instructions and a light approach to drawing fantasy characters. A great follow-up to 1-2-3 Draw, another book in this series of art books."
4,NICE ALARM CLOCK FOR THE PRICE,"OVERALL, I LIKED THIS ALARM CLOCK. I LOVE THE PROJECTION ON THE CEILING.THE ONE THING I DO NOT LIKE IS THE BUTTONS. THEY ARE A LITTLE HARD TO PUSH. I FEEL THAT THIS CLOCK COULD BE MADE BETTER.HOWEVER, IT IS A GREAT PRICE AND VALUE. IT DOES DO THE JOB."
3,Corby CR-A78 Digital AM/FM Clock Radio with Time Projection,This is a sturdily built product with good though not sleek looks. Perfrmance is good. Main issues are with the projection display whose time needs to be set independently from that of the main display clock and hence needs to be reset every time when power fails since the back up battery only provides back up for main clock. Secondly the projeced time display is small size and red in color. Wold have preferred larger display and in brighter colour.
3,Okay for its price,"Okay for its price. Not the best and most convenient clock. It is tough to turn off the alarm. You have to switch the alarm off, as opposed to a button that you can press. There is a snooze button, but it's still pretty tough to hit. The LED is great though."
2,disappointing projector,"I have 20/400 vision and wanted to be able to read the clock without my glasses. The projected digital numbers are to too small on the ceilings (barely readable with squinting), too faint and blurry on the walls across the room.The clock itself works just fine. Low rating because useless projector for me. If I had no vision problem, this item whould have gotten 4 stars. (5 stars if with a rotating projector head)"
2,Unfortunately a 'no go',"I used this projector clock to try to project 3 feet in a mostly dark room. It attempted to project a 4 inch image onto a white paper on my wall. Unfortunately, the lines were too thin and too faded to see the image from more than 4 feet away. It did not work for my purpose."
3,Coby CR-A78 Clock,"I purchased this clock for my 4-year old daughter. The clock works well, however, the sound quality of the radio is poor. I guess when you pay less than twenty dollars for a radio, one should not expect a hi-fi sound. The projection feature is a plus, because it vibrantly projects the time onto the ceiling and it contains a focus knob to ensure the projection is clear. My little girl really enjoys the clock, so I think it was worth every penny. A good buy for the price."
3,Nothing Special,"This itme reminds me of a diver's halmet.The Alarm Sound Is Not Loud Enough. Overall, it is ok item."
2,Project is poor,"I wanted a unique looking clock, with big numbers, and a projection mode for the clock. I got two out of three with this one. The project on this clock is very poor quality, projecting from my desk to the back wall (approc 12' away) the image never makes it to the wall.I'm sure there are better projection clocks out there, this one just doesn't do it."
2,Failing of certain presumptions,"I suppose I had certain presumptions about this item, and for $15 I shouldn't have expected much, however I was less than impressed with this item when I received it. The projection system is weak (less than 5 feet or so in a dim room and can only be swiveled about 85 degrees up (thus, you cannot project onto the wall behind the unit, as I has wished to do. Additionally, the snooze button is located on the front of the unit and my tests of attempting to press it one handed from a prone position resulted in toppling the item."
5,long lasting,Have had this alarm clock since 2008 and it's still working great. Love how it projects it very clearly onto the ceiling and you can focus the time if needed. good product
2,Not as pictured and not very sturdy,Somewhat disappointed in these earrings. They are NOT as pretty as they look in the picture and I am skeptical that they will last very long. My guess is the 'flower' is going to separate from the post the 1st time I forget to handle them with the UTMOST of care.
2,Inferior Performance,"Very, very slow in toasting. End product is unevenly done...very dark on one edge to light on the other. Because of the slowness in toasting, if the bread is thick, it tends to dry out before it is done. Although this is supposed to be a powerful toaster, the heating elements seem very skimpy. I would have returned it for a refund if I hadn't thrown away the box before I tested the appliance."
1,A great toaster... only if it worked!,"This toaster has all the features to make it a great toaster, but its problem is it's just poorly built. I just had to return two of them within a month. On the first one, the right lever got stuck after using the ""pop up"" feature the first time. This was after one day of usage. On the second one, the left lever broke and would not hold the toasts down after 3 weeks."
1,toaster,I bought this toaster from Amazon. It never worked and when I called Krups they were not very helpful. Amazon made the return easy. My Cuisinart toaster works well.
3,good for not really caring how cheap it looks,when i opened the box it was a crushed hat with bent wiring. It will not shape up correctly. its a cheap piece of felt with a wire running through it. i could have made my own. Definately does NOT look anything like the picture.
5,Ok,"Walking in the memory lane with this perfume. Maybe the last time I enjoy the fragrance , thank you for delivery on time"
5,Excellent,The thoeries of Marx or Engels or Lenin are readily available in moderns paperbacks . This edition I wanted for what it is and part of a collection . It arrived in excellent condition .
3,Outdated,"When it comes to Quark titles it seems pitiful that this should be one of the better methods of learning Quark, having said that if it were a more uptodate title dealing with Quark 7 and up it would probably deserve five stars.The book deals with Quark in a understandable way going through a number of tutorials which deal with the hows and whys of Quark in a logical manner almost like being in a classroom environment but is let down by out of date fonts which do not work on most modern computers--has no website back up(as most newer books do) and misses out on many of the newer applications of Quark 7.Having said that there are no other books out there that come close to this for its perpose."
1,"Waste of money, ingredients","Buy another cookbook. The recipes in this one obviously weren't tested. My daughters and I, who cook frequently, made the ""chocolate"" cake (which called for 3 teaspoons of cocoa) and the chocolate chip cookies--both had strange ratios of ingredients and turned out horribly. Surprising, given DK's reputation."
5,Highly recommend it,Bought this cookbook for my 14 year old son for Christmas... kinda would like to have one for myself!! Really well thought out book for beginner cooks ... not just children... these recipes are not baby-fied. Totally recommend this cook book for beginning chefs! at ANY age!
1,Don't bother wasting your money,"This has to be the worst cookbook for children I have ever seen! Even an adult who knows little about cooking will find it useless. My 18 year old could not even follow the recipe instructions in this book much less would a child be able to by themselves or with only a little help. For example, on pages 62-63 there is a stir-fry recipe that omits telling you that you need to put aside 2T of oil for the stir frying. Instead, it has it written as an ingredient added to the sauce, which is not to be used until the end of the cooking!! Another page tells you to put a potato in the oven but doesn't say which shelf to put it on and has you heating an oven and cooking at 400 for 1-1 1/2 hours for just 2 potatoes! Whoever wrote this book gave little thought to it. It's asking for a disaster in the kitchen when it assumes someone knows all these left out details."
3,DK Children's Cookbook,"This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, so I can't really evaluaate the book. I can let you know after the holiday."
4,Very good compilation of articles.,"This book is a must have for everyone planning to or currently designing vlsi high performance circuits. Covers initials/reviews of mos transistors from mid-to-deep physics to simple components and then to further more complicated circuits. Interesting to mention that the authors compile a set of related articles published on highly respected journals. Cons are that many times those coverage are superficial, condensed to one page and leads you to deeper research on the original references. Pros are that you have, in only one place, a whole compilation of good articles in the area. I think this is the most interesting aspect of the book, because once you study the concepts covered, you have good knowledge to understand those articles. Overall, the book outperforms many other books, both in coverage and in the level of detail on each topic."
3,It's ok...,"A so-so book. Sort of sloppy, doesnt' quite stand on its own without a course to guide you through it. There is some good information in this book; the chapter on transmission lines is quite good. There are also some more practical design examples in the latter half of the book. I'd recommend the Weste book instead."
2,DIC is an average textbook,"Like most circuit design books, DIC doesn't cover issues that a serious circuit designer should know about. It does not mention or barely covers transistor sizing techniques, drive strengths for standard cell libraries, antenna rule checks, synthesis, and signal integrity issues like crosstalk. Sequencing elements like flipflops and latchs and memory design are covered poorly. Despite this, pipelining and parallelism are covered fairly effectively compared to other texts. Many other circuit design books are also fairly outdated now with respect to semiconductor technology. For instance at 10um cmos technology, leakage power is significant, but a casual reader would never know that you should increase the transistor threshold voltage or lengths on circuits on non-critical timing paths to control this nanometer effect."
4,Color?,"For some reason, the international edition of this book has color pages in certain sections but the US edition of this book is completely black and white. This is a bit of a problem since these color pages are about circuit design rule in programs. Each color represent a different material. The black and white version looks like it's every material is the same."
4,Good introduction/intermediate level book,This book is not for the very novice engineer. But its a good reference for a grad student or beginning engineer.I liked the way the author builds the chapters from one to the other. He also talks about practical examples which is very important. The chapter on Xmission lines in particular is very well written. Also includes second order effects.My background: I have 15yr experience doing analog IC design. A through and through digital engineer might have more thoughts on this but for me its been a great reference text book.
2,Poor printing quality,"I bought this book for my class. The seller described it as new but actually not when I received. I think it's only 50% new at the most. The most important thing is this is the version that is for sale in India only, which means that's a copy version. The paper and print quality is so pooooooor!!"
1,Poor Quality,"I really thought the material was strong, which is unfortunate because the quality of the book was very very poor.Chunks of pages separated from the binding. Our quarter is only 11 weeks and 15-20% of the pages are now loose and fell out of the book.I paid over $130.00 dollars for this. I realize it is more of a publisher issue than Amazon's but...Prentice Hall Electronics and VLS Series: BAD QUALITY"
3,Ok for transistor level ...,"Has some good information at the transistor level. However, the book falls apart after the first time you open it. I returned my first copy and got a brand new one, but same thing happened. The back of the book cracks and pages fall out as soon as you start flipping through the thing. Highly overpriced, as most books of this type are!"
3,Good to Hear...,"It is actually good to hear the voice of an icon of the 60's such as Brautigan. I did not expect such a mellow, soft, almost effeminate diction. Bad thing about this CD there's much static noise, so typical of the era (say, recording of the water dripping from a faucet or such).The questions to ponder are these:how well has the work of Richard Brautigan sustained the burden of time? And how does his lyrical short fiction compare to his poems heavily imbued with an impromtu surrealist Americana of the 60's."
5,in lov,the moment i open that dvd case my childhood memory was flying all over the room...it brought back so many good memories for me...i loved it
5,Love it,Can't say enough great stuff about this set/show. My boys ages 8 & 3 would watch this all day if I'd let them and I don't mind letting them watch a couple of episodes back to back because they are learning from it too.
5,Great educational series,"Although the animation seems to be on ""early 80s"" level, these series do provide lots of interesting facts from various areas. The plot is built around situations when Carmen is attempting to steal various historical objects all across the world while two kids are always there to stop her from doing that. While ""investigating"" a case, each episode introduces a history and other details associated with each respective item and/or place. Probably will work best for kids 8+."
4,Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?,"I'm glad this fun and educational cartoon is out on DVD. I'm still waiting on the whole ""Wishbone"" series about the cute dog, his life, and adventures into classic books to be put out on DVD. The cartoon version is great, but the gameshow version of ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"" theme song still plays in my head. Worth it.Please come out with a complete series of Wishbone on DVD next! Thanks."
5,Great Series for a Great Price,"I remember watching this everyday when I was younger, and the random facts I learned are priceless. I can't believe I got the complete series for less than ten bucks. This is one of those shows that I'm going to treasure forever and share with my kids...whenever I have them."
4,worth it,My 11 yr. old daughter has learned a lot of geography from this series. She watched episode after episode until she watched all of them.
2,Disappointing,"There are different speed settings for the ball, and on high, the colors are overwhelming and hypnotic. On slower speeds, the colors are good, but the ball rubs on the plastic, which makes a ticking sound.Due to the black color of the plastic, the water is difficult to see as it runs down the stairs, so other than the ball, there's not much to watch."
3,Fun Satire,"A cute book, read it for the humor. It is very funny!! Those who believe The One Minute Manager teaches you to be a manager in 3 minutes are foolish. The One Minute Manager helps new managers understand how to work with new relationships in their new position. If you have has a bad experience with your manager who is following the steps of The One Minute Manager then you are either a poor employee or work for a manager is just not following the steps properly, You will most likely rationalize the situation and believe what you want."
1,Poor quality.,"Not a good quality as I was expected. Very different from the picture. Dust, hair come to the ball and stick to it for good. At the end returned this item."
4,Nice Exercise Ball!,"We acquired this ball under unusual circumstances. My wife and I use a 55cm ball daily in a stretching routine that greatly helps getting our old bones moving. Since we were flying, and bringing an infalted ball was not an option, I bought this and had it sent to our destination (family in the mid-west). It worked out well. It seems to be well made and met our requirements. As stated in another review, the included pump is almost worthless; I blew it up myself (lungs are still in pretty good shape). I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for such an item."
1,Leak all over after 6 months,"I bought it from Target and I am angry that water leaks all over my countertop after 6 months. I do not understand why and the water in the bottle is all heat-up and hot.....This is a very bad design I won't trust hamilton anymore....This is the piece of ""shxx"".....Waste my $....."
1,Never buy!,"I would not recommend buying this product. Even when I first got it, it didn't work well, and it went downhill from there. The unit didn't adequuately cool the water, the water flow rate was slow. After just a few months it stopped cooling all together. It was still under warranty so I called the 800 number for instructions. You could ship the entire product to them to receive a full refund, or mail the cut cord end for a $20 refund. Considering shipping costs, I opted for the $20 refund. I called again 4 months later asking where my $20 was. They stated that it takes 5 to 6 months to process a refund! Amazing! Now over a year later and still no $20. That should be illegal. I replaced it with a Whirlpool that has been working well for over a year."
1,My unit broke after 9 months,I bought mine from Target and after nine months it suddenly stopped working. No water would come out from neither hot nor cold dispenser. The unit looks nice but can't even last a year. I also don't like the fact that both hot and cold water switches must be turned on. I once only turned on the hot switch since we don't need the cold water. But after a day or two the water smelt burnt. I'll never buy this brand again.
1,Beware the Warranty,"I carefully followed the instructions when setting up my Hamilton Beach water dispenser, and was quite pleased with it. However, after just eight months of normal use, the unit's motor burned out. I contacted Hamilton Beach, and was told that the unit was still under warranty and could be replaced. However, I would first have to send them a check or money order for $36 to cover shipping & handling! That's more than one-third of the original purchase price!I have no intention of gambling more money on another Hamilton Beach product. Instead, I will be seeking a different model from another company."
3,"Good size, but I wouldn't buy it again","I bought this because I wanted a smaller water dipensor at a good price. I like it, but the water dispenses pretty slowly. It takes over 10 seconds to fill a pint glass, so next time I buy a dispensor I'll get the spigot kind. I have never had a problem with leaks. The water never had a plastic taste, and I did a thorough cleaning the other day and it still works fine. My main issue with the dispensor is that all of a sudden the motor got pretty loud. I just ended up turning off the cold side, and only turn it on if I want cold water."
1,poor quality,The heater function heats up the while 5gal water bottle which causes the air in the bottle to expend and cause water to leak.Very bad product.
1,"Also leaks, other commenter hit the nail on the head","Mine leaks as well. At first i thought it was that the water bottle had a pinhole leak in it (not leaking from it, but keeping it from having a vaccum and letting air in the bottle, thus causing it to leak downward). After reading the other reviews, i did some testing, and if i keep the hot off, it doesn't leak. If i have the hot on, it only sometimes leaks. I had the hot turned on, and my office door closed over the weekend, and it got REALLY warm in my office (they crank the heat in the mornings). When i opened my office door i felt a heatwave, and as i expected, it was leaking. As the other commenter mentioned, I believe it is due to the heat causing the air to expand in the bottle forcing the water out a little bit."
2,"Great for those who are either perfect, or have ADD","Great pictures, I'll give it that. However, I felt the book was assuming too much, especially for the beginning rider. Great ideas, but not much instruction to back the pictures up. If you really progressed as fast as the pictures without professional help, kudos to you. Otherwise, not realistic. Common faults illustrated will continue without someone else (ie a trained professional) to back you up."
4,Fun and not so creepy as her later ones,"Val McDermid can write and I'm always grateful for her lesbian characters who just happen to be lesbian rather than that being a plot device. Lately though her stuff has had a lot of gratuitous violence and in the last one a rape scene written to titillate - as if there weren't enough of those written by men. So it was great to find her older series with a more straight forward mystery, well plotted and with interesting characters. Highly recommended."
3,Unsteady Middle Eastern Rhythm Cut-up,"Startled is how I feel whenever I put either of the discs of this two CD set on. The music always inspires a suspicious air. This album paints the hot driftless air, the grit and the rapid sense of urgency that one can encounter in the Middle East. It's probably the way the drums and cymbals just burst through a background of street noises and hum. If you haven't listened to Muslimguaze before I would start somewhere else, say ""The Return of Black September"" or ""Farouk Enjineer"". If you are already a fan you will find this extended play a fine addition to your collection of Bryan Jones' work."
2,Decent lamp if you can put it together,"This is a decent lamp, but it would have been a lot easier to put it together without instructions than with the misleading instructions provided. Lite Source should be absolutely ashamed of itself for sending out a product with such terrible instructions. It would be very simple to fix them and the failure to do so shows a complete lack of respect for the customer. I strongly recommend against buying this lamp (or anything from this manufacturer) for that reason."
4,Insightful and Inspiring,"Josie enters the hospital at a very ill 67 pounds, believing that she is almost perfect. She doesn't realize how sick she is, or how much she has wasted away. Her brain is so starved that she truly believes she needs no food, and scoffs at others who do eat, and only begins to feed herself after numerous threats of hyperalimentation. Through her stay in the hospital, Josie recalls events in her life that lead up to her eating disorder, and slowly begins to figure out how it came about as she begins the slow process of recovery. The whole book follows her through her hospital stay and the refeeding process along with the thoughts that circullate around such a difficult time."
3,DARK SHADOWS COLLECTION VOL 26 [FINAL VOLUME],IT WAS SAD TO SEE THIS GREAT GOTHIC SOAP OPERA COME TO THE END ON APRIL 2 1971.WAS NOT TO THRILLED WITH IT ENDING IN PARALLAR TIME AND NOT 1971 WHEN BARABAS AND JULIA HOFFAMAN AND PROFESSOR STOKES CAME BACK FROM 1841 THROUGH THE TIME TRAVEL STAIRCASE.ANYWAY I GAVE IT 3 OUT OF 5 STARS STILL MUST WATCH IT TO SEE THE FINAL ESPOIDE OF THE COLLINS FAMILY ENDING ITS CURSE.
5,The Final chapter,Yes - this is probally either the second to last or the last 40 episodes - which will have several events such as some one crossing over into the parallel time room just he dies - leaving the others to wonder why. The Collins couple will get trapped into the room and survive the night and end the curse and the show will return to the present time where Julia and Barnabus will attend David's graduation and a statement that dark shadows never set down on Collinwood again
5,Awesome poster!,"If you are a Brad Pitt fan, or you are a Fight Club fanatic, then this is a poster you must have. I love it. I have it framed on my wall and I get compliments on it all the time. Well worth the purchase!"
4,Pro's and Cons,"The order came in on time, but I did have a problem with the packaging. The box was slightly crushed and the poster itself had some creases and rub spots from the shipping process. I still framed it and hung the poster on my wall, It is a good quality print and all in all I am happy with my purchase. If you are a fan of fight club or Pitt I would suggest this poster, just don't expect to recieve it spotless without any slight damage. All in all I will buy from poster revolution again, but I do hope my next order is in better condition."
4,Great for the price,"Fantastic poster, came with a few wrinkles the word ""fight"" on the soap bar is hard to see though, but overall the poster is great."
4,Graduate Real Analysis,"Overall, I think this is a very good book. It can get difficult to read at times, but many graduate real analysis books are like that. This is probably one of the best ones out there. I think it is better than Royden and Rudin. Not only does it focus on theory but also applications. Royden and Rudin mostly focus on theory. If I have to teach a graduate course in real analysis one day I would use this book."
3,Exercise bands,"They are okay. The DVD is worthless as far as instructions on how to use the bands. There are several attachments and absolutely no instructions on how to use them. But, the price was good and they work as far as just beign exercise bands. Would probably buy them again."
4,Mostly satisfied,"The progym appears to be that it will ultimately suit my needs. The main reason I ordered this kit was that it included ankle cuffs. Those provided in the kit that I received were either defective or a poor product design. Using the lightest weight tubing (5#) the cuff does not stay attached and pulls apart. I have contacted Gofit and am waiting for a response and that they will replace the non-sticking cuffs that I received. The foam handles are great. I prefer using the exercises in the Thera-Band Resistance Band & Tubing Instruction Manual. The DVD is okay but the intended use for this kit is an adjunct to physical therapy and the DVD is more gym/fitness oriented. It has been some time since I contacted progym. The ankle cuffs have not been replaced...therefore, I must use them cautiously until I can find a substitute. The ankle cuffs on ripcords are fantastic but are not interchangeable with progym"
3,Go anywhere work out equipment,"The bands, the case and the DVD are great for people who travel or who want some simple equipment for an at-home work out. The DVD is done well - clear, simple instructions for a total body work out.This is a creative opportunity. I found I didn't need the door thingie. Door knobs and hinges served may purposes. It's a greaat challange to create moves using the tubes. I love it. An alternative to free weights and machines is always welcome."
3,"Worked well for about 2 months, and then broke","For the first two months, these cords worked great. Then, the green band (15 lb) band broke, and I have been relegated to using the blue and red together, just to get to 15 lb, and I can't go higher. Good design on the bands, easy to switch the weight, but the quality really brings down the value. I would recommend going a different direction, especially if you are looking to use these a lot.Also, just for kicks, I watched the DVD, and it was pretty bad. I bought these for use with a different workout, but the DVD is bad. I would not even think about using it."
3,By the newer version of this product not this one,"This is a very useful means for on the go strength training. It has a DVD that explains basic core development. It is durable. I have had it now for four years and it still works like new.However they have since come out with a better version of this project. The hooks on this scratch and actually draw blood when they scrape against your skin. This unit comes with only one door attachment, and the handles are not of great quality."
1,Does Not Last,"Worked for a while, then the elastic snapped! Safety aside, it disrupted my workouts. I went with Bodylastics instead, and they have been holding up far better (and with more room to grow). This product was not worth the money."
4,Good product,The product is of reasonably good quality although I'm not sure how long the handles will last.All in all its good enough for home use and I imagine that most people would be satisfied with it.
4,I like this product but....,I purchased this for my husband. This is what he has to say about it.I like it because it's easy to use and you can travel with it. I think it's a good exercise tool.It seems to made well.I don't like the instructions. I think they could have provided a more detailed and varied use of the product. I had to just figure out a lot on my own.
3,Not perfect but useful.,"I bought this at a local sports store and I have been using it daily for about 2 months now. The bands are designed to have a working distance. For example you get good resistance for about 8' and then it becomes obvious that you are hitting the limit of the band and it may snap. So you need to just work from 4' to 8' which is more than enough for any exercise I can think of. The carabiners are bit weak too but I picked some strong ones up at Home Depot for about $3 a piece. In my opinion the handles are great for the price and I actually use them in body weight exercise with strap attachments similar to the TRX and have had no problems.In conclusion, do not bend the bands beyond their normal limit (you'll be able to feel the band not budging) and if you're concerned about the carabiners buy some stronger ones at Home Depot. I don't have experience with other sets like this so I guess you could always just buy a different one."
4,I like it,the resistant tubes are good and the DVD comes with good workout plans. I have used this kit for 1 month and at the same time watched my diet. I already lose 3 pounds:)
5,"Good workout, good value","This is a handy, well designed item. I was surprised by the quality of the the exercises that are demonstrated on the DVD. They focus on strengthening the core. I had just finished a course of PT for a back issue and these exercises were consistent with those prescribed by my physical therapist.My only quibble may have more to do with my own impatience, and has nothing to do with the quality of the product, but applies to the use of bands in general. Each time you want to change the height of the bands you have to unthread the bands from the strap that holds them in place behind the door, open the door and move the door strap, and rethread the bands. As I speak I wonder how anybody who's too lazy to do that can get teh motivation to exercise at all."
5,Great product,Paid $19.95 couple of weeks ago when it was on sale. Quality product and well worth the money. Comes with full instructions but I even come up with my own exercise. You get 3 bands for different level of workout.
5,FItness while you travel,"Somebody was really thinking clearly in designing the GoFit Ultimate ProGym. This kit is very easy to pack and yet has enough resistance to support a pretty thorough upper and lower body workout when you travel. The quality of construction is as good as any I've seen in competing resistance band products. It has all the attachments required to hook it up to door frames and to attach to your feet.If I have one beef it is that the accompanying DVD needs additional engineering so that you can access individual exercises directly from menus. Some options are offered but it doesn't always reliably return to the menu after going over an exercise.One addiditonal benefit is access to the web site. There are other exercises on the web site and there are ""mini"" videos available to demosntrate how to do them properly.We are so pleased with this product that we bought a second one to keep at our vacation condo."
3,examples,Even though this product comes with a dvd there isn't very detailed instructions on how to use the product. It does show different exercises but doesn't show you initially how to hook the different bands together and to the doors.
3,Ultimate pro gym,The bands work as they are supposed to. However I have yet to figure out hoe to attach the door connections for the leg workout and after emails to the company I still have no reply. I don't believe the customer service for this product is very good and doubt that I would buy anything else from them.
3,Takes some getting used to!,I believe the pro gym will be beneficial once I am comfortable with all the moves. After just one day I could feel the effects on muscles that have not been used in a long time. The instructor takes the time to stress correct form and explains the benefits but the it jumps a lot between positioning the cords in the door. The DVR moves faster than a beginner can posssibly move. I had to keep pausing the DVR and repositioning the cords and then found that I had missed a few reps in each instance. I am sure that once I am comfortable with the whole program I will be happier.
2,Broke after 1 year,"I bought these for my boyfriend as a gift, and he absolutely loved them... at first. He typically used the one with the most amount of resistance, until broke near the handle after 1 year of use about 2x/week. Then the other two broke shortly after - same spot - with minimal use."
2,User Beware,"The GoFit Ultimate Gym should be issued with a warning. On my first use, the hook at the end of one of the bands broke, sending the band and the broken hook flying back on the door and making a large hole in it--bad enough, but I am glad it went that way and I dii not go flying with the hook pursing me. I shall be writing to GoFit with a complaint. I wanted to alert users to this real danger."
4,A Bowflex for the Poorer (or Frugal) crowd,"This great product offers a fast, easy, safe and reliable FULL-BODY work out, and really helps to tone leg, arm and back muscles, while building power and endurance.Easy to use, with a handy picture-guide and DVD with instructions, workouts, circuits, and tips.In my opinion, you can perform *almost* the same full-body workouts with these sturdy resistance bands, as you can with much, much more expensive (larger, heavier,) exercise machines."
1,Garbage. Seek a different brand.,"I purchased these bands one month ago and during the first week one of the bands snapped at the plastic end leaving me with two bands. I was still able to do some exercises with the remaining two bands however today, one month into using them, a second band snapped in the same spot and I am now left with one band which is not useful for any exercise. This is my first set of workout bands and use them at my office but I caution anyone looking to purchase these to seek another brand as these are trash. Waste of money."
1,EXTREAMLY DANGEROUS! DO NOT BUY!!,"I bought this for my boyfriend as one of his Christmas presents. He's been using it for less than a month and hasn't had any issues. Until tonight. He was using 2 tension bands attaced to the carabiner (the instructions say you can use up to 3 for extra resistance.) when the silver part of the carabiner broke off and went flying. It sliced his thigh while the carabiner flew into his foot. His foot is so unbelievabley swollen and bruised. I honestly think he broke a bone/bones in his foot. We'll be finding out soon. On top of the $25 we lost on this product we will now be losing a lot more at the emergency room. Thank God no one else was in the room when it happened. Like our 9 month old daughter... This product needs to be recalled. Save your money, but most importantly a body part!"
4,good product,come with every thing you need to work the arms and body plus it come with a work out dvd that will help you learn the work outs
5,Excelent,Excelenttttt!!! This product works every muscle in your bodyyyy it is just great and for the price even better...
1,Disappointed,"The write up indicated, in fact I followed hot buttons to, a ""custom fit"" tray. The picture showed a tray that followed the contours of the space and fitted up from the tail gate to the brackets for the rear seat. I got a generic and undersized piece that was woefully deficient from what was promised. It was neither as wide as the space nor as deep as the space. Too much trouble to send back!"
5,"good product, prompt shipping.","product was perfect as described and delivered promptlely, sooner than estimated. Good product. Good seller."
2,so so,The wick was a nice fit . the only problem with these wicks was that they burn way too fast. I would buy again but would have to buy more than 2.
5,"Great knife for the price, quality Wusthof product.","This is an excellent ""half tang"" utility knife, very sharp with a classic style handle. The handle has a nice feel and is of medium weight (not too heavy, but not feather-light either). I can dice broccoli and cut lemons with ease. It is also great at cutting sandwiches and burritos. While this knife does not have the very solid balance and feel of a Wusthof Classic knife (which has a thicker, bolstered blade) this quality utility knife will certainly do the job, and the knife's long blade (it seems like a 5 or 6 inch blade, not 4.5 inhes) is very handy at slicing right through foods. If you want the most satisfying cutting experience, go with a pricey Wusthof Classic or the very nice Wusthof Grand Prix II with comfy ergonomic handles. But if you don't like spending $70-$100 for one knife, this Wusthof Gourmet Utility knife is a very high quality option and will fulfill most people's needs for a ""go-to"" utility knife."
5,Dogfights Season 2 is awesome,"I love this show!. This is the best thing out there. If you like aviation or military history, this is the show for you. The really cool part, over and above the awesome dogfight action, is the comments from the actual men who where there. This would make a great gift."
5,Great Gift,"I bought this for my husband's Christmas gift, and he loves it! It has been gratifying to see him enjoy hours of entertainment on a subject that fascinates him. He is a pilot and loves to watch an episode and then come and talk over what he has learned and how he identifies with the people in the program.It was a good choice for a Christmas gift, and I especially liked that I did not have to go to the mall to find it."
2,Not good,I did not like this scoop at all! I usually use the OXO scoops but was in need of a different size. It is nice that they offer this scoop in just about any size but I did not like how it worked. It felt awkward in my hands and the cookie dough stuck to it so only a portion of it was coming out.I would not recommend this product.
4,good for cupcakes,"makes filling cupcake pans so much faster. fyi this scoop is a little bigger if filled to the top than needed for a cupcake, i fill it about 2/3. also its a little annoying when the batter drips off the side and gets on to the cupcake pan so i make sure to swipe the bottom real fast before i fill each pan otherwise it will drip and it bothers me. still way faster than before, when i used a spoon or ladel and it took forever."
4,right size!,"I needed a very specific serving size for a particular preparation I was planning, and Zeroll Company has all the serving sizes you can imagine.Design is very nice and so are the materials and colors. The only flaw I noticed is that the cleaning mechanism of the bowl is not very accurate and does not reach the bowl surface evenly enough, leaving remains at the bottom of the bowl, certainly not as other brands I own, like the all-steel japanese made dishers, which are cheapper."
5,GREAT SCOOP!,"I purchased several of the ZEROLL FOOD DISHER the 24-1.49 oz, 40-0.71 oz, and 100-0.32 oz, I got them all from Amazon they are the best Ice-Cream Scoops, However, I use them for measuring and scoop dough, for muffins, cupcakes, cookies, meatballs and so many other uses, they are easy to operate and so strong and well made, it makes the work so much easier, I'm glad I found them here! Please Check Posted Pictures under the Item with step by step Photos, Cooking with Zeroll Universal Scoop and making the Best Oatmeal Raisin Cookies with the Recipe. Thank You"
2,disappointing,"The Zeroll scoops are not of the quality I hoped for - they seem rather flimsy and not designed to last. The handle is a bit cumbersome and therefore it is somewhat difficult to use, though perhaps if you are a left-handed person the handle would strike you better than most. The Ecko scoops I have (maybe 10 years old)are of much heavier construction and are available (I found finally one at a candy making store) for about half the price. High quality kitchen tools make routine chores more fun - well...the Zerolls are no fun. They do work, mostly, thus a 2 star rating rather than a one star rating."
1,EZ Disher is not EZ! Does not work!,"I am very disappointed with the Zeroll Universal EZ Disher. It was very uncomfortable and awkward to use and worse of all, it does not even work. Better off using a regular scoop or just a regular spoon!A 1 star rating only because it's required."
3,Too Much Fluff before Too Much Drama,Writer dragged on the good part way too long. I was three-fourths the way finished before it really got good. No mother should have that much control over her children.
5,The best RL recording.,Oddly enough I stumbled across RL back in the 90's while I was working on some stuff on the bench and MTV2 was on the TV in the background believe it or not playing music videos. I wasn't paying much attention to what was on then all of a sudden this song catches my attention. I turned around to watch the video and catch the song name and artist. I believe it was Let My Baby Ride from the Come on In album. Well within a few days I found the Come on In cd and I have been hooked on RL ever since.I like pretty well anything from RL but the First Recordings is my favorite by far. I really wish I would have made an effort to go watch RL play live. It is sad that RL and many others didn't become popular or even known until late in life because there aren't making them like these guys anymore.If you like real blues and don't have this CD don't give it a second thought pick it up and wear it out.
5,Great Prep Kit,"Although the exam is not interactive, and you must write your answers down, it was very very helpful and consistent with the actual exam material. Much better than some of the other exam practice tests I used."
1,Kindle version is a mess,"Having 5 practice exams on your iPad seemed like a great way to study for the exam. Unfortunately nobody bothered to proof this e-book before selling it to the public. The numbers in the answer key don't match up to the questions or the answers just got left out of the answer key all together. It makes it more difficult as a study guide than just reading the textbook. I contacted the publisher thinking of course they have realized their embarrassing error and can they send me the corrected version. Instead, they emailed me back wanting me to walk them through the errors, which they will send to the author/editor and then I can contact Amazon about getting a revised version of the e-book someday. Really a cheap product and not worth the money."
1,Answer key is wrong!,"After doing the entire first test and checking answers, I discovered that the answer key and the answer explanations do not match up with the questions! Editing please."
4,Cliff's Test Prep California Real Estate Salesperson Exam: 5 Practice Tests [2006],This book has over 750 real estate exam question and answer explanations.

1,When it seems too good to be true...,"...it usually is (too good to be true). This is remarkably inexpensive for a rack-mountable power strip; you can't even buy an empty 19"" rack enclosure this size for this price. But it's just as the first reviewer said regarding dimensions: it does not fit the standard 19"" rack spacing. Also, the screws holding the thing together are round-topped and not recessed, so if you try to put anything over or under it in your rack, that other piece of gear will likely get badly scratched by this unit's screws. This was designed by a truly incompetent design team; don't reward them. If you need a rack-mount power strip, avoid the Gem Sound SP-8500."
2,Not worth $8,"Very cheaply made. Pieces mostly will stack. Board itself would get 1 star. Not the typical cardboard you would expect in board games. This is more like thick construction paper, very floppy and bends easily. Took a chance with this product with no ratings. Save your $8 and buy another checkers set."
3,Not very tantric.,"Not very instructional, this would better be called a demonstration. It is best paired with the book ""The Essential Tantra: A Modern Guide to Sacred Sexuality"".Neither of these are actually Tantra. If you are looking for something Sacred, look elsewhere. However, if you are interested increasing sexual pleasure through Tantra-like activities and positions, these are certainly amongst the better learning aids you can get.The video does show graphic demonstrations of the more intimate areas... your imagination does not have to go to far with this one. Coupled with the book I mentioned, you will build a solid understanding of erotic massage techniques.I gave it 3 stars because it isn't tantric as the name implies. I would give it 4 stars if they called it what it is - Erotic Massage."
5,This is a Got To Have Video,Beautifully and Artistically done (but not too shaby) this video is amazing in the demosntration of the Tantra techniques and practical applications. Very good to watch and practice with your loved one. You will enjoy this video.
1,Disappointing Video,"I was quite disappointed in this video for a number of reasons. First of all there is absolutely no verbal instruction given. For someone who does not have the book and is not a massage therapist, the instructional value of the video is minimal.Additionally, the accompanying background was so over-modulated that it was terribly distorted and distracting, at best. In order to watch the video comfortably, I had to turn the sound track completely off.I would not recommend this video for the purposes for which it is described."
2,Not Much Here,"From the cover and title of this video, I was expecting a couple to demonstrate the principals that make Tantric massage different from your standard erotic massage; or at least the mutual excitement which leads to mutually fulfilling lovemaking with continence. I was therefor completely disappointed by the anonymous black-clad masseur whose hands seemd to float dramatically but impersonally on and above the bodies of his subjects. He gives absolutely no verbal instruction as to what he is doing or why, so billing this as an instructional video is a complete mistake. The quality of the video itself is average to poor, with a badly-spliced sound track more likely to inspire aspirin consumption than lovemaking. I believe this video survives only because there is nothing else available!"
1,A joke,"When my partner and I viewed this, we laughed so hard. It was NOTHING like what we expected. The massage techniques were nothing special if you know anything about giving a massage. You basically watch a man give a woman a body massage, then work his way to her genitals. Then it switches and a woman massages a man. The unrealistic part of it to me was that you could see (when the woman was massaging the man's genitals) that the man was getting so hot and about to blow, but then the woman just quit. Almost like he had an orgasm without ejaculating. I didn't learn *anything* from this video. It was a total waste of money."
4,Fun for Dr Pepper fanatics!,My dad is a Dr. Pepper fanatic! Growing up he drank it when others drank beer. Hahahh. So this was perfect! Nostalgia! He hung it up in his garage.
4,Nice but small than most and a bit thinner than some... Still enjoy seeing in the kitchen,"You are getting what you paid for here. There isn't anything above and beyond but it is a nice cheap way to decorate your kitchen, dining room or entertainment room... Especially for you Dr. Pepper addicts."
2,Look Carefully...No Paper tray,I bought one of these and packed it up to return tonight. There is no paper tray. The only way to feed paper is by opening the front door and sticking in sheets of paper. Then they hang out the front. The paper tray is an option that no one has in stock. I am going to swap for a 2550N. It comes with the tray and is supposed to be networkable.Bob
2,Poor design,"There is no paper tray on the 2550L, and when I went to purchase a paper tray (an expensive accessory) directly from HP, they were ""out of stock"". Also, the printer oftern makes loud noises when performing internal maintenance (not good to suddenly wake up to in the middle of the night). I've sent the printer back and bought a printer from another company."
2,Have to replace color cartridges too often,"I have had this printer for about 3 months now and have already had to buy a $175 drum and countless toner cartridges. And I don't print anywhere near the maximum output of 30,000 pages per month. I might do 2500 a month. Yes the printer is cheap and prints high quality, but it isn't worth all the extra costs associated with it. And it is very slow if any type of complex document is sent to the printer, VERY SLOW. To upgrade the memory from HP is $500. If I had it to do over I would not have chosen this printer."
1,Smart chip screws you,"As other reveiwers have noted, the smart chips inside the toner cartridges are anything but. They generally force you to toss perfectly good toner catridges and imaging drums away before they're even near empty.Our per page cost, not counting the paper itself, sky rocketed to around 6.5 cents a sheet! Turns out, it may be cheaper to buy a new printer than to restock this one."
1,Three letters P.O.S.,"I live close to h/p in silicone valley. I would really get a kick out of driving down and walking into the main office and smashing this pos on their floor. Eats toner/ loud as hell/james all the time, try to print on legal size paper.... forget it.I guess people live and learn. I learned to buy from Japnease companies. At leist there stuff works... shame on you H/P"
1,Horrible Printer - VERY expensive to run,"What a piece of you-know-what. I really wish I would have done my research before buying this printer. The consumables are VERY expensive, and like the others have said - it's clunky and noisy. Anyone giving this printer more than two stars has to be out of their mind. What a waste of money!"
1,Macintosh User Not Happy,"If you use a Mac, I advise you not to purchase this printer. In spite of the supposed support for OS X, most of the features of this printer are not available, as HP has not bothered to make the toolbox available for the Mac. I found this out having wasted a lot of hours trying to adjust print quality settings and FINALLY getting sombody at HP to tell me I can't access most of them. Now, not only will I return the printer, I'll never buy another HP product. False advertising."
4,Works great for Me,"I've read a lot of bad reviews, but I have to say mine works perfectly. I have a mac, and it's hooked up remotely/ wirelessly, and it's only jammed once in 3 years. No problems. I'm shocked so many others have had such trouble!"
1,READER,This has proved to be a very difficult read. It seems to have a lot of doubletalk. After rereading many of the sentences I still can't make sense of them. I usually can zip right through a book. All I can say about this is that it has been a real chore.
2,4 Days seemed like an eternity,"This book 4 Days in Eternity, by Wayne Marentette was OK at best. I highly recommend Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow ISBN number 0972962301, if you are seeking a book with ""Substance"" that goes much deeper. 4 Days seemed like an eternity when I was reading it, drags on."
3,Do I have to have an NDE too? I expected more!,"4 Days in Eternity is a wonderful book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have an NDE myself? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, just one chapter about her great NDE, but the rest of it shows how anyone can open up, if they learn how. I'm not saying 4 Days in Eternity is a bad book, really, but I guess I was just expecting more."
1,worst after life book ever,"I am a person who has a master degree and very much love after life books. The best after life book authors are raymod moody and Melvin Morose. When I started reading this book that was super long, I realized the words were so dramatic I could not after awhile understand what the author was trying to tell me. This experience was very long and drawn out. I am not saying the author didn't have this experience, I don't know but I do know it could have been written better."
1,Recording of a 1000 Microphones,"This recording is ridiculous! What were the engineers thinking? Every section of the ensemble sounds like they were recorded in their own separate studio. I'm convinced that Mahler was a master of orchestral color, and knew how to get the sound he wanted, even with the huge forces of the Eighth. This recording does not convey that sound. To me, the recording is unlistenable. I consider it to be a failure on the part of the engineers, which is a real shame, considering all the musicians that were gathered for this recording (oops!)."
5,Ratha's creature,"Have you ever wanted to know what it was like way back when when the lager cats were more in command? well this book is set for just that, for cat fans of course, and this is a deliteful read. I was in middle school when i first read this and was just captivated with just how awesome a read it was and couldn't put it or one of it's other sequels down becuase i love animals and there's nothing like a good animal read, fictionally. I wish i owned the book so that i could read it again and plan to own it soon enough so please, if yoyu're looking for something to read then pick this one up or else you'll miss out on something great!"
4,If only cats had conquered fire...,"I am a cat person. I happen to believe that all cat people would enjoy this book, given they like a good infusion of adventure. Clare Bell brilliantly reimagines a prehistory where sentient cats are suggested as being the top species and a cat called Ratha dares to experiment fire. The writing here is top-notch and vivid with description that never gets too flowery. These are cats, but they are not cute and cuddly--think cousins of the saber-toothed cats. Bell gives their characters a wonderful blend of humanity and pure cat instinct. I don't know if I would consider this children's literature, but rather something anyone could read. Wonderful pick for any lover of fantasy adventure."
5,Simply Amazing!,I fell in love with this book as soon as I read the first chapter let alone the the the first page. It was as if I was I was there herding prowling with the Named Clan. A really good book and so is Clan Ground which are the two best books out of the series!
4,Another good Bosch novel,"As usual, this book starts off slow but the tension builds well and the conclusion is terific. I really llike this character!"
3,Blah,"This addition to the Harry Bosch series never really grabbed my attention. However, I kept reading, hoping for some drama or tension, but to my disappointment, there just wasn't any. To sum up my impression of the book, boring."
4,"Nice One, Mike","Yet another thoroughly enjoyable novel featuring the now retired detective Harry Bosch. Harry can't leave things alone so off we go into a well-paced, fun to read adventure. If you like detective novels with doses of humor, sex, action, twists, turns and guns, I've no doubt you will enjoy this book. I recommend, however, that you start with the earlier books so you can get a feel for how smart and tough HB is.Connelly's writing style makes these novels so very, very good. He drives the plot smoothly, with lots of sudden turns and plenty of romance that peaks a reader's interest. My wife read it between Danielle Steele books and she enjoyed it as well.Harry's retirement made me feel older than i am was the only downside. I hope he goes back to work, somewhere or develops his private eye business."
3,"Slow start, but a good book","I 'inherited' this book and decided to read it before giving it away. I thought the book got off to a slow start and it took me awhile to get interested. (I have never read a 'Harry Bosch' book, so maybe if I had, I would have gotten into the plot a bit sooner. I'm not normally a reader of this genre, but I have to say, once I got past the slow start, they book held my interest. A lot of suspense, a lot of mystery and a bit of 'revenge'. The solving surprised me a little, but it was a nice change from what I've been reading lately, where everything is predictable. If you are a fan of crime solver mysteries, you will enjoy this book."
4,Not a disappointment,I've read a number of the Harry Bosch books and this one is one of the best. Just enough twists and turns to make it one that was really hard to put down!
3,Relentless Harry,Harry Bosch proves that he lives up to his reputation as relentless in this investigation of an old case. An old robbery gone bad linked to the murder of Angela Benton has Harry on the trail. Why was she killed? Was the theft of two million dollars an inside job? And what happened to the disappeared agent Martha Gessler? Why is the FBI so hot to keep Harry off the case?
4,Harry Bosch a flawed and fascinating character.,"Harry Bosch doesn't have a perfect life so this makes him a more real character. He is flawed and that's what I find fascinating. Michael Connelly does know how to write interesting, hard-to-put-down stories and this is one of my favorite from the Bosch series."
4,Just keep on listening,"When I listened to the first few chapters of this book I thinking ""Why is this book so popular and why did it get such great reviews on Amazon?"" But, I just keep on listen hoping it would get better. And it did. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it."
3,"Good read, but nothing original about the story","Fairly entertaining, but almost a 'cookie-cutter' crime story. Having read quite a few books in this genre, I can say that while the book was not bad, it also didn't really provide anything special for the reader that he could not have gotten from a dozen other crime novels. I will give the author credit for developing the characters well, and I found the single-bullet theory to be interesting as well. Other books in this series are better, don't start with this one."
5,Spellbinding,I found this book to be full of suspense as well as a deeply emotional journey for Harry Bosch. Never a dull moment! I loved it.
4,4 stars again,"I've read 7 or 8 Michael Connelly books and they're all excellent reads. Lost Light was no exception. Good suspense, heavy-duty realism. I'll eventually catch-up and read them all, and by now I'm sure I won't be disappointed with any of them including the non-Harry Bosch books. I do hold out hope that he'll have one that rises above the others and I'll give it 5 stars instead of what I always give books that I'm glad I've read, 4 stars."
4,Lost Light by Michael Connelly,I like his books they are all very interesting and sometimes you can not leave the book not even for a minute until it is finished.
5,Lost Light,I enjoy the writing of Michael Connelly. He makes you feel like you are riding along with Detective Bosch. Wish he would have more books with the Lincoln lawyer and Bosch together.
3,Not the best Bosch,"Not one of Connelly's best Bosch Novel. I felt there was too much padding, and much more LA noir than necessary."
5,Lost Light,I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Lost Light. I am reading all of the Harry Bosch series and hope that he never has to retire.
4,Lost light,Always enjoy getting into a harry Bosch book. This one was entertaining but not one of my favorites but still a great book
4,Well done!!,Exceptional work. very well done. good time line. he does it yet again.I also recommend a couple of Non Fiction books as well: Nightmares Echo (Katlyn Stewart) and I Know Why The caged Bird Sings (Maya Angelou) both are very empowering
1,I don't get it.,"Reading so many of these reviews, I don't get. I really don't.In my opinion, this is a major disappointment. The main plot is incredibly contrived; the subplots are intrusive and unnecessarily complex; the dialogue lacks inflection, pacing and character uniqueness (Connelly should read Elmore Leonard); and the characters, for the most part, are wooden and one-dimensional (Milton=bad, Kiz=good, Janis=loyal, etc.)Also, whenever necessary, the author resorts to ""character facilitations."" Need a spying device? Bosch has the ideal friend, who can provide him the exact house and navigation equipment. Need news information? The ideal reporter owes Bosch a favor. Need good legal help? The perfect defense attorney owes Bosch a favor. Need a Las Vegas cover? You get the point.I won't even get into the implausible, ""wrap-it-up"" ending. It's been well-stated by other reviewers.As I said, I just don't get it."
3,An okay read...,"I quite didn't purchase this novel, rather received it as a gift when I bought something from Borders recently. Since I haven't read any of the Michael Connelly thriller series ever before, was not sure of what to expect. I wouldn't say it's too good, wouldn't say it's too bad. Anyway, I quite didn't expect ""Arthur Conan Doyle"" style and I'm happy was up to my initial expectations. The only downside is that the intricacies and governmental bureaucracy amidst the CIA and FBI and so on is explained in too much detail, which makes the reading a bit boring. Overall, a good time-pass read!Subhasish GhoshSt. Cross College,University of Oxford"
1,Connelly has sold out,"Michael Connelly's have been steadily going down-hill. He was one of the best detective series writers ever in classics like The Last Coyote, The Concrete Blonde, and Angels Flight, and he made me a loyal fan. The last 4 books have been getting simpler and simpler. Lost Light reads like Sue Grafton. And its not just that the writing has gotten simplistic, the character Harry Bosch has lost his punch. Now he's just a nice bumbling guy. Why do so many authors abandon the style that made them famous once they arrive? Lost Light reads like any of the stupid best selling authors out there, Michael Connelly has lost the original voice he once had. Seeing how many people like this book just proves the point that he's figured out how to make more money by making his books easier to read and easier to write so he can write them quicker. Very unfortunate, we've lost a great one."
4,"Easy, enjoyable read . . . but","it never ceases to amaze me when an old lady like me can figure out who the main bad guy is before all these super-intelligent LAPD cops, FBI agents and Harry himself. As soon as the ever-so-illusive reference was made, I knew he'd end up being The One. It was so obvious that I thought maybe they threw it in just to throw me off - - but no, Connolly took the easy route. So I remove a star for that and for the ""surprise"" ending that has been so overused, it's no longer a surprise at all."
4,Another great Harry Bosch,"I love the Harry Bosch series. I wish I had started reading the series in order just because I think the continuity helps to get to know the character, but it's not necessary to read them in order to get the concept. There's a bad guy, Harry figures out who it is, and gets him. The story lines are not too complex but interesting enough that I usually read them in a day because I want to know what happens. I haven't read a bad one in the series yet."
5,a very good Bosch book,"If you love Bosch books this will not disappoint you. If you like detective stories and still haven't read those of detective Bosch, you're probably going to get adddicted (at least I did and know of plenty other people who did)."
5,Well done,I look forward to Mr. Connelly's books. I make sure I have an afternoon available because it is hard to tear myself away from his work once begun. He comes through as always with a nice slice of his world for me to savor.
5,Another Excellent Bosch Adventure,"I just finished Lost Light after reading several other Bosch novels, which is probably the best way to read it. Certainly, Lost Light stands on its own as a great detective story. But if you ""know"" Harry, this is just a fantastic story! And the title is appropo on many levels, which will be revealed through the storyline. There is little more for me to say that hasn't already been written in the reviews, so I'll just echo other 5-star reviews -- DITTO!"
3,Not quite on center,"Retirement doesn't seem to fit Harry very well. He spends a lot of time thinking/hating/yearning/cursing/obsessing over the badge he no longer carries. Granted, being a PI means he can finally play 100% by his own rules, he's just not the same without the department. The mystery was more drawn out than it had to be, with the terrorism angle just a frustrating waste of time. When the payoff finally hits in the ambush at the end, it's pretty good.The first person narrative is jarring. It's not that Harry's mind isn't an interesting place to be, it just feels like some of the eloquent descriptions and thoughts of the author that make other entries in this series so smooth and flowing cause the story to skip and sputter around in places.I don't think I've mentioned this before, but I don't like Eleanor Wish. I wasn't happy to see her back, even if she's not around for much of this book. She's a black hole Harry gets lost in, which only takes away from the books she's featured in."
3,Interesting addition to the series,"This is the first Bosch book written from the first person. I found it an interesting change although I prefer third person.I generally liked the book. The case was interesting and believeable. You don't get the good characterizations you get with Connelly's third person narratives, so I missed that.It is also a little unbelievable that Bosch gets all of this cooperation now that he's retired. I mean, come on! Law enforcement people and reporters putting themselves on the line over and over again for a P.I.? I think not.But it is readable and enjoyable."
4,Another great Bosch book,I have read every Connelly novel but hadn't been able to find this one. All Harry Bosch fans need to read this one too.
1,A Hack Job,"I was wondering whether/when Michael Connelly would sell out by writing junk and trading on his reputation. The latter, of course, well deserved -- but writing is hard work and after churning out so many very fine novels it's hard to imagine that there's that much left in MC, until he has time to recharge his batteries and his inspiration. Unfortunately, he chose the path of easy money instead of literary standards.Not much to say about the book. The writing is mostly awful. Our hero, Bosch, de-evolves from a complex individual to a fairly uninteresting cardboard character. The plot... well, what plot?If you must read this book as part of the series, do yourself a big favor and wait for the (used) paperback version."
5,Second Spectacular Adventure,"The second book in the Battlecruiser Series introduces the new arch villian. His name is Saatori and he is the warrior supreme. Bent on vengeance, hate and duty; he will carry out an act that will trigger an intergalactic war. The only one that can stop him is Commander Janice Anders Daria, commander of the Battlecruiser Pegasus. She once fought to save a planet from invasion, now she must fight again to save her own life and the life of her crew. This is a must read!!! Once again it will introduce a Starship beyond your dreams in a war beyond your imagination."
2,Strange!,"The author apparently does not take seriously what the Bible says about Paul regarding his Roman citizenship, his being a Pharisee and his family. I question the research that went into this."
3,Genealogy of the Goding family,The book is great with a few exception. All the pages on the right side of the book in not readable. So the information on the right I will not be able to read. So if your family information is on the right side of the book you will be missing a lot of key information.
2,Delving deeper into Dragonlance Religion,"If you are looking for more options for clerics and mystics, keep looking. The prestige classes here really focus more on giving divine focus to other classes. There are a few cleric prestige classes here, but not many.This book delves more into the churches and followers of the different gods. Reading the Gods (or Religion) section of the Dragonlance Campaign Setting gives you a pretty good idea, this just goes into more detail."
4,Seems to Hold Up,"I have used these in my humidifier for several years now and they seem to do a good job. If you have a Duracraft Evaporative Humidifier, I would recommend this."
4,"its a filter; it fits, and filts","If you need a filter and you know what you're looking, this vendor is a good source."
4,Good Value,"My dog is a chewer and pressed rawhide is the only thing that really lasts with him. Also, pressed rahwide only breaks off in little bits so he doesn't gobble big hunks (helps prevent choking). These are large and while not as compressed as some--they made for a nice long chew."
3,Good with supervision/timer,"These are great for the aggressive chewer, but you'll need to time it if you base it on my experience. I tried the 8"" with a 75 lb american terrier, and an 8 lb toy maltese.Both are pretty aggressive chewers, but both got diahrrea from getting to about half the bone. (I tried 8"" for pit bull and 4"" for maltese).Limit it's intake and you should be fine.They DO entertain for what I'd say is good, which is an hour. If your pet is to be confined, unwatched, or crated for over an hour, I'd say use a Nylabone or other bone for aggressive chewers."
4,"Read it now, detox later","A frightening cross between Mary Chase and Hunter Thompson, ...""Isla Vista"" details a drug soaked Halloween in a supposed college town. For this reader, Mr. Knox accomplished a rare feat: he made me laugh out loud. Then again, this may be because of the contact high generated by the all too real descriptions of various mind- altering substances. The book is funny, the author skilled, and the subject terrifying to anyone over 40. A great read and a fun ride, even if a little close to the shoulder of madness. I loved it."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"It's pretty evident this is a first attempt at writing from someone who doesn't really know how to write. As other reviewers have said, let's put aside the fact that this book has very little to do with Isla Vista. This book could have benefitted GREATLY from an editor. Or even a proofreading by an older brother or someone with a high school degree.If you can get past the horrible grammar, you're still left with a book that makes a weak attempt at humor. It might be enjoyed by middle schoolers, but definately not by grown adults."
4,Great Memory For An Author Notorious For Blackouts!!!,"Yes it is trueI have been to rowdy college parties!!!!It is true this is very Hunter ThompsonesqueFear and Loathing on the Central Coast.The writing style is kinda hard to comprehend at firstBut, you get used to itI liked the part how every house in IV has a nameThe BoathouseThe Bob Marley HouseThe JunkYardI had forgotten all about that...I wonder how Mr. Knox's liver is doing these days?Seems like he liked them pillsI 2 wish it had more on IVMaybe for his sequel...This book should be a must read for UCSB incoming freshmanThis book should be on every former Isla Vistan's bookshelfEven if it's just to show your friends someone actually wrote a book about living in Isla Vista!!I hope this is the 1st of many from J.M. Knox..."
5,Random Lingering In Isla Vista,After the first page you can't put it down. He commands the narrative and gives the reader new eyes. If you thirst for brilliance than this is your book.
1,WHERE`S IT AT??,"I WOULD TRULY LIKE TO REVIEW IT BUT IT STILL HAS NOT ARRIVED !!!IT HAS BEEN SINCE AUG 9TH , SO WHERE`S IT ATR. CIPRES"
5,Grab the Kleenex!,"Do you keep secrets from your spouse/significant other? From your family? When is just a little secret too much to keep?A Simple Gift will force you to ask yourself those questions. True to form, Witmer/Grayson has written an emotionally rich story of old and new family traditions and family problems. I loved the family history aspect of the story, and of course, Avery & Mike's journey.This book and a Christmas cactus will make a great gift this holiday season.As always, I look forward to the next book by this fabulous writer!(If you're new to this author, you owe it to yourself to check out her backlist!!)"
5,Wow!,"Avery is getting her groceries one night and sees her runaway daughter who has been missing for more than a year working in the next checkout line. Her daughter has a secret and resists Avery's efforts to reunite. The more she tries, the more her marriage crumbles. This is a beautifully written book about three people who love each other, have hurt each other, and one remarkable woman who brings them back together as a family."
5,woodworking,'cabinetmaking and millwork' is an excellent resource for those who wish to do some woodworking as a hobby or to enter woodworking as a profession. it is full of pictures and hints of different methods you may use to build things for the home. a previous copy was given to my son and i had to replace it. it will be used quite often.Cabinetmaking and Millwork Revised Edition
3,The Servent King: The Bible's portrait of the Messiah,"A good overall picture of one of the important themes running through the bible that adds to a comprehensive understanding of the plan of salvation. For me, it was a little too sketchy."
5,Awesome book,Its a life changer. It showed up when it was supposed to wink wink. No really Its a great read and its transformational just in one read. Two thumbs up!!
2,Defective,First look at this and I wanted it ! It seemed like a metal armor suit for my phone but when I received it in the mail the thing didn't even stay shut like I tested it on a drop and the front swung right open and left my phone unprotected ! I quickly returned for a refund not a great buy.
4,Ethereality incarnate...,"It really blew me away. Being an avid disliker of things involving ""pinkness"", I was surprised at the atmosphere provided on this album, and I have every intention of growing my LPD collection. These are the type of CDs you'd want to play while lying on your bed at night with your eyes closed, visiting the space behind them. The moods of the songs shifted too, subtly, but they were noticeable if you paid really close attention. The only thing I regret about this album is that it didn't last longer."
3,"This is an another ""old collection."" Only for the advanced.","Pretty much everything I said in my ""Under Triple Moons"" review can be applied here. This is an album of older, less coherent music than I am used to by the Legendary Pink Dots.By no means would buying this album be a waste of money. However, I recommend the beginning start with either ""The Maria Dimension"" or ""Hallway of the Gods."""
5,A Pale Green Review,"This is probably the BEST LPD release; if not than pretty close to it. Actually, luckily, the first that I purchased. A lot of rare material here. The first disc starts great- great low cost effects. If you could put sounds through a kaleidoscope- this is what you'd see. The second disc has a lot of old and rare material including ""April's Song, which isthe oldest surviving recording of LPD."" There is otherwise unreleased and mix tape songs that may only exist on some random compilation or outlandish archive. Buy this release if you care about this band."
4,product description is wrong,The unit itself is really great especially if you have an aversion to mosquitos as we do. Coils may be lit then placed inside the holder and hung in an appropriate spot. The coils are held in place very firmly yet allowed to burn properly. The product description states that 10 coils and two stands are included - they are NOT it is only the holder.
4,Like the Hanging Feature,"Since mosquito coils tend to be rather static in where it can be placed, and quite often massively dependent on wind change, I like that this holder allows for the coil to be hung up. I haven't even used it like that yet but it works great just sitting in one location too. Strangely enough, I keep thinking the coil will burn through the mesh. I've only used it a few times but it doesn't look like it will, though it does leave an intriguing black, coiled trail. I don't know why they chose to design it like that but I'm sure there had to be a reason - whether good or bad is something else."
3,A concise and only history in Chinese Triad Organisation,"This could be the ONLY comprehensive book on the history and practice of Chinese Triad society (the equivalent to the Italian Mafia). Although the book is rather dated as it was written in 1925, it is an essential reading for those interested in day-life Chinese culture and practices at the turn of last century."
2,Narrow scope,"I used to subscribe to Colonial Homes magazine and enjoyed it, but this book focuses primarily on upscale interpretations of colonial interior decoration. There is little representation of antique cookware, fireplaces, windows, etc. Perhaps the word ""decorating"" should have tipped me off, but I mostly see a bunch of pretty photos without a wide range of colonial styles. Where are the simpler, more rustic interiors? Most are closer to the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg than to any working person's home in colonial times.This book is more a representation of the Colonial Revival period, which came about a hundred years later than true colonial days, and which was itself a romanticized and updated version based on the original period."
2,typical,This book is definately for the young minded. I've put the book down so many times and picked it up not remembering where i left off. This book is really typical. The main character seems awfully young for someone who is supposed to be going off to college. This gave me no new insight about eating disorders. I would not reccomend this book.
2,attention seaking and eating disorders,"It just wasn't a believably written piece. It seemed to sensationalize aspects of eating disorders and behaviors, and point to the generalizations that sadly dominate this diagnosed mental illness. A mental illness that strikes mostly elite, upper class, white people? Book after book repeats the same drama. It's just another plug that supports the unfortunate generalization that all people with eating disorders have little financial concerns or someone else typically foots the bill, are self absorbed, spoiled, controlling and manipulative attention seakers who buckle when the possibility of failure or personal responsibility encroaches. I have yet to seen anything opposing this in print yet."
2,boring........unfinished!!!,"I started reading this book then i put it down somewhere and totally forgot about it - it was that boring!!It really confused me because the book wasn't really that much about eating disorders and i thought of Kim as being an average sized teen worrying about her weight like everyone does but then all of a sudden she was in hospital and everyone was worried - it was like she became ill overnight. Her illness was all covered in about one page and by the time i'd got that far in the book i was just flicking through it and so practically missed the page long hospital drama!!!If you are going to write about eating disorders then i think you should cover all the really serious issues that go with them - this book didn't do that at all, infact i think it trivialised eating disorders. The book made it seem like eating disorders are cured in a day or two when they are not, there's a long healing process involved and its a shame the book didn't cover that."
1,Waste of time,"If you are looking for a book that thouroghly describes anerexia or bulemia, dont get this one. It had like 3 major parts that described ""Kim's"" anerexia,thats about it...I was looking forward to reading this book and when I was finished i was very disappointed. If you are looking for a good anexeria/bulemia book..DON'T read this one!!!"
5,Hope for those with Eating Disorders.,"Personally, I thought Kim:Empty Inside was an amazing story of the struggles of a young girl with Eating Disorders. I myself, having been bulimic, recommend this book to all who are in need of hope and inspiration. I love it! 5 stars!"
3,review from a seventh-grade reader,"I found this to be a very strange book. I don't really see how a teenager could have written it- some of the events, such as Kim getting so hungry she ate out of a dog bowl (?), made me wonder how anyone, even an adult, could have written this book! I liked some of the parts about going away to college and coming home for Christmas, but the book dragged on so much I ended up not really caring what happened next. They skimped on most of the parts that could have been important, and you didn't really know she was losing so much weight until she ended up in the hospital. This could have been a great book if it had been written better, but aside from that, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone ""serious"" about reading up on eating disorders."
2,too many similarities for me,"When I read Go Ask Alice as a teenager, I felt the girl's downward spiral was too extreme not to have been exaggerated. But I didn't make the Beatrice Sparks-as-actual-writer connection until I read Jay's Journal. There were plenty of similarities. I went ahead with ""Kim"" because eating disorders are of interest to me, and I figured perhaps Ms. Sparks would vary the old pattern a little. Forget it: yet another essentially good, optimistic, fun-loving teen from a nice white middle-class Christian family. I do like (Ms. Sparks's) suggestion that faith in Jesus can help heal one's troubles, but it is just wrong to deceive about these books being written by real teens. It's an insult to any readers who know better. And the results of drug abuse, occult experimentation, and chronic binge-purge cycle are usually overexaggerated or atypical in these kids' stories. Far better real-life accounts exist!"
1,Wutever,"Ok, first of all I have both Ana and Bulimia, and they cant be cured over night like kims were. Also U dont get all sick and need to be hospitalized in the tiny ammount of time she did. I thought the book was really typical...ive already sold my copy!"
2,Give me a break,"This book only got 2 stars because of the fact I actually finished it, I don't usually finish books.This book is so annoying. No one with a real eating disorder is that happy about EVERYTHING, she happy about her parents, and some guy, and school, gymnastics and life...if you're so happy then why would you need an ED? Plus there is no way to get to 75lbs by just bulimia, maybe there is, but not the way she was going at it. There was no account of excessive excercise either. And getting so hungry she ate dog food???? Give me a break!It was an OK book until it got to her ""recovery"" she was just too happy about that too. Read Diary of an Anorexic girl, I mean most people will fight recovery. This book is just so pathetic, she sounds like a 12 year old girl not a college freshman. I in no way could relate to this girl and usually I can. Thank god the book was short other wise I would have completely wasted my time."
1,This is Atypical of Cosmi JUNK!,"The game itself is a lot of fun, but the tiles are very hard to see. I have seen better Mahjongg games for FREE on the internet. Not worth paying ANY amount."
3,"Interesting, but not complete","This book is, in many ways, a wonderful book. It has beautiful illustrations of old patterns, and it has an interesting and extensive history section. Unfortunatly this history is not complete. It is focused almost entierly on Denmark, with some about the rest of Europe, but none about the spread of crochet in the US. The illustrations are lovely, but they are almost entierly from danish patterns and collections. If you are looking for general historical patterns (from about 1800 to the early 1900s), then you will love this book. If however, you are looking for somthing more general and less eurocentric, this book is not for you."
3,"Good product, but beware of DVD drawbacks","This is a good product, but I wish I had known the following:There is a significant delay between when you push the record button and when recording actually starts, in the neighborhood of a few seconds.Also, there is no editing as-you-go with DVD. If you are used being able review the last part of what you taped and record over it if you don't like what you see, you will be frustrated with DVD recording. There is no editing unless you transfer it to your computer and then of course you need to record it again on a DVD burner or video CD.I ended up exchanging my DVD100 for a miniDV format TRV22, which has the same resolution & basic features, is smaller, cheaper, and doesn't suffer from the problems mentioned above."
2,Great Picture Quality but Lacks tools,"Sony DVD Handycam has great picture quality, if all you want is to film and playback on your DVD player. I wanted to make a compilation DVD but The ""ImageMixer Ver.1.5 for Sony DVD Handycam"" sucks. I bought another Movie editor but it cannot read the MPG created by the Sony software. So you have to convert the file to MPG2 format.It takes six minutues or more to finalize a dvd, It's faster to download using USB2 to finalize, Unfortunatly the Sony Software does not reconize the dvd it not finalize.I can't belive how hard it is to find, Sony minDVD media. I tried other brand names, but I lost some of the DVD because it did not finalize correctly.(...)."
4,Great Video Camera with built in DVD!,"I love this camera sooo much! However, the viewing angle has become a very big problem in that it does not pan out wide enough for a lot of shots. Otherwise I think it is a great buy for the price.Another thing to not though is the ability of it to take still photos. It is really cool that after you are done filming, there is still space allotted on the DVD so you can add still photos to the movie you just created.The photos will be displayed at the end of the movie like a slideshow. It is a really nice way to end a viewing and the camera sets it all up by itself. That is a very cool feature. Hope this helps!"
3,"Cheesey, mindless fun for a rainy afternoon.","While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,"" a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem. There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun. Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither."" Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization). This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare. See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere."
4,Learn how to keep healthy plants in your aquarium,"This is an excellent introductory book for anyone interested in learning how too grow aquatic plants in their tanks. The book begins with descriptions and illustrations of everything that may be important to this goal, such as water chemistry, lighting, substrate, aquascaping, etc. After that there is a listing with nice color pictures and info on about 60 of the most commonly available plant species. There's a total of 135 photos and illustrations."
2,Doesn't say much... does even less,"I got this head to take on my vacation to Venice as I had no one to travel with, and I thought the head would make for a good partner.However, the head practically refused to say a single word throughout the trip. All conversation between us was very forced and one sided.At one point we missed our train because head didn't wake us in the morning, even though it was her alarm clock which was set. It looked good sitting next to me on the plane and in restaurants and for that I""ll give it two stars, otherwise I do not recommend it."
2,DO not get this if you are looking for a wig stand,"I recently purchased this item to serve as a wig stand. However, I am in the process of returning the item, as the one I received had an unstable bottom that wobbled to begin with. Not only that, but the material is way too flimsy to serve as a wig stand. I knew ordering initially that it was made of styrofoam, but I did not realize how inadequate the material would be to hold something on it. So, if you are looking to get a wig head to hold your wig- this may not be the one to get. I am actually using a long plastic cup placed upside down as a temporary solution till I find something better."
1,smallest head ever,"This has got to be the smallest head ever. Feels like it was molded from a child. Not suitable for wigs because it is not a true reperesentation of a human head, unless you're an alien of some sort with a tiny head, don't buy. seller was great and item did arrive on time."
1,Small styrofoam head size,"Beware, looks like a great buy, however these heads are childsize and do NOT hold the shape of your wig. Yes the base is great for clamping down if you desire to do a hairstyle, but the head itself is sooo small even if you pinned the wig to the head it would not work! Not worth the $$$, unless you are looking for child size heads!"
2,not as pictured and size too small,The head that I received was not exactly as pictured (actually looks like this: http://www.amazon.com/Beautys-Bin-4884-Foam-Mannequin/dp/B005FFQJXC/ref=pd_sbs_bt_5 ). It's also a lot smaller than my usual styrofoam heads. Will not buy again.
1,There are places that have it for less,"A while ago, I started to work on a web show as the costume designer, tech producer, prop person, and makeup artist. My job requires me to make wigs, and my sister was getting sick of me using her head for that purpose, so I decided to buy an actual wig head. I looked online, and found that Sally Beauty Supply had the exact same thing for $3. Literally, the exact same thing. I measured it and everything. Just go to Sally Beauty Supply, it's a lot cheaper. Oh, and if you want to see what the wig head can do, go to [...] (it's my web show)."
3,Good for hanging weaves,"20"" Head; my head is 23"" so I couldn't use it to make a proper fitting wig. Still good for hanging weaves."
4,A head above the rest,"I purchased this for my wife who has just starting making crochet hats, they look impressive on it. It arrived in a few days in good condition and I don't have any complaints."
2,"If you want a small styrofoam head, this is for you. Not the average head size.","Don't bother with this, its too small for wigs.....I was expecting something a little bigger. This would be good for kids, if they want to play dress up and have their own little wigs. Other than that, don't waste your money."
4,just what i needed,"I ordered this foam head to use for making my wedding veil. A Styrofoam head is just that... if u need oneed one then this is does the job. With shipping it is more expensive than the ones at my local costume store, but they were currently out of them and I figured it was worth a few extra dollars to have it when I needed it."
3,Small,Tjis head is smaller than my head so when I try to use it to make a u part wig it makes it a little difficult. I measured around the head of this item and it was 21 inches
4,Female Styrofoam HeadSHANY Cosmetics,This was just what we were looking for.. Arrived in good shape and was the right height. I would recommend it.
1,Disappointing!,"I was disappointed with my purchase because these foam heads were the size of a child's head, not an adult. Other than this they were perfect!"
3,not much to say,"I guess this does the job. It's inexpensive and gives me a place to put my wig. Not great as being sturdy, but serves it's purpose at a low price"
3,Not what is pictured,"The head that is pictured as the product is NOT what I got. I have the one in the picture, and wanted another. I got this one and noticed immediately that this was TINY. It is child sized. Now, I will be using this purely as a wig stand, I don't need it to keep its shape, just to hold it. But this was surprising to see. If you want something larger, don't bet on this one. I don't know if they ship out different heads, but as I said above, I didn't get the one above.If you aren't picky, got for this one, or go to SallyBeauty. They have the one in the picture, for the same price or less."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I understand the item is styrofoam, and I expected a few imperfections, but I got more than a *few*. The item has clearly been used. It's dirty! The nose is squished in and it is very noticeable. Like others, I bought this to model hats and such. I am embarrassed to take pictures of my hand-made items on this styrofoam head. I will say that it was packaged very well and I got it quickly. I suppose I got what I paid for, but I think I will be making another purchase for a different head model with a different seller."
1,Can't upgrade your system,Lavasoft Ad-Aware Plus Anti-Spyware [18 Month Subscription]Lost 2 1/2 years of a paid license when I upgraded to Vista 64 after purchasing 3 year license. Lost hard drive so upgraded to Vista 64 and Ad-Aware won't work! No refund and SE Plus (which works) will not be supported in future
2,Old version,"Ordered version 1.06, but was sent v. 1.05. Lavasoft website will upgrade the old version if I send them my order number. However they will not accept an Amazon number. Amazon customer support said sorry, that they would accept a return and provide a refund.I will be more careful where I buy software in the future."
1,nonexistant customer service,Having purchased both Adaware and their personal firewall i can tell you that there are far better products that are available then these. But this company has the worst customer service that I have ever encountered anywhere. After getting computer generated responces from element 5 [ the company lavasoft hired to do their customer service] for over a week I removed their software and bought new software from another company. Beware of Lavasoft!!!! An awful experience!!!
2,Old Version,"The product was fine, but, I received an older version and as a result I couldn't properly update it even after registering it. As a result, I purchased the newest version available directly from Lavasoft and it works fine and I have had no trouble updating it. Why didn't you specify what version it was on your website; then I could have made an informed decision?"
1,Questionable reliability,"I bought this product and was happy for the first month, then the product quit working. I replaced the bulb to see if that was the problem and that did not help. I then replaced the batteries and that did not work, so I bought the adapter and the product still does not work. I either got a lemon or the product is not reliable."
1,Worked great for a few months...,"I absolutely loved this booklight and used it often for the past 5 or 6 months. Then, it suddenly stopped working. I replaced the bulb, tried batteries etc. but no dice. I'm past the point of returning the light, so I wanted to warn other buyers that this may be a great product, but don't be surprised if you get a lemon..."
1,WARNING: Seller is NOT Amazon,"I received the ZTS battery tester as sold by Adorama via Amazon as a gift. Neat product but it only worked for a few minutes before failing. Unfortunately, Adorama return policies are much more restrictive and inconvenient than Amazon. Adorama did not exchange this item for a new one per my request. I recommend avoiding Adorama."
2,Doesn't always work,"I got this to test some batteries i had collected from around the house. I got a blank readings on about half the batteries I checked. That would be fine if it meant the batteries were dead, problem is, I get the same reading if I slip in the middle of the test and lose connection. Some batteries don't register at all. In both these instances,I tried the batteries in my battery charger that has an lcd screen and half the time the batteries gave me a reading in it. My battery charger isn't portable though and only works with AA and AAA's.Summarization: Doesn't always work. Thinking about sending this tester back. If is was a cheap $5 one, these problems might be acceptable, but this was supposed to be a quality battery tester and I still don't know what kind of charges my batteries have."
5,Works well,"Good one I think. Easy to use. How accurate I'm not sure, but the options at this price point with this kind of simplicity are limited."
4,An Average Book,"Owl's New Cards is about, of course, Owl. Owl's best friends are Rat and Brown Bear. They do all kinds of things together, including playing cards. However, the group discovers that Squirrel ruined their deck so they couldn't play. The next day, Owl decides to make his own deck of cards. He works really hard throughout that day and is extremely proud of himself when he's finished. However, when his friends don't show up for their usual card game, Owl decides to find someone else who appreciates his cards. This, in my opinion, is an average book that's worth reading."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"I bought this thinking that the Corel company, which offers this on their website, would not sell an inferior product. But I was wrong. This program froze my computer up several times. Once while trying to install it, then after several tries installing it froze again while I was editing a show, then again when I tried to burn a DVD. This program is terrible and I would not recommend it to anyone. Also my opinion of Corel just went into the toilet. Thank you very much. Rene Boufford."
4,"Comfortable, but large","Obviously this pillow is large as it is a queen size. It is just a little too tall for my taste. Very comfortable and nice, though."
5,Great replacement,"When I got the pillow, it was much larger than I expected. It had no smell, like other reviews had mentioned - just took some getting use to the larger size. It sleeps well, and has been a great replacement for my older foam pillow."
2,pillow,This pillow is extremely stiff. I actually ended up with headaches caused by the pillow. Was not at all what I expected. No give at all.
4,Good buy,We like latex foam pillows and these purchased were a good buy for the price as compared with department store prices. Very happy with purchase.
5,Love them,"This is my fourth set of latex pillows. So far I like these because they're not so dense and heavy, but they are light supportive and so comfy. These pillows maintain shape for years to come. I started buying latex pillows fifteen years ago and still have my first set as back up in the spare room. I did buy one set that did'nt hold up as well as others. I think the velour type cover contributed to how they held up and I didn't care for that cover at all, because pillow cases don't slip on them easily. Only time will tell about these pillows, but so far so good. Love my new pillows!"
3,Foam pillow,I love beauty rest latex foam pillows BUT I wish all the ones I had to select from were not FIRM. I prefer a medium density pillow but all I found in stores and online were firm.
3,"Simmons Beautyrest Latex Pillow is ""Ehhh...""","This pillow is a little thin and small. It looks to be standard size but it's very thin... if you need a latex pillow with better support I would not buy this pillow. It supports your neck and head moderately but only when I put my arm under the pillow for more support. If you want a good latex pillow that you won't use much or that you plan on using for travel, this is your pillow. And the price is not reasonable at all. I found out after I bought it that I could have bought a two-set from Walmart for only a little more than what I bought one for on Amazon. Shop around. Do your research. Make sure you know what you are buying! It's hard at times because the product descriptions are usually lacking or not very accurate. I believe Amazon should have a better policy on that sort of thing."
2,OK,"I ordered this same pillow same brand at another store 2 years ago. I left mine in a hotel and was hoping to get the same pillow again, but it's not the same as my last one. I think Simmons changed manufacturers because it is very firm. I needed one a little less firm. In fact I ordered another one from another store and it's the exact same way. Very firm. I can't find one by Simmons like I had before. No big loss though. My husband liked it very much and my sister-in-law kept the other one. So if you like firm and springy this is the pillow for you."
3,Better than what I had,I think this pillow is good - but my neck still hurts when I wake up...haven't found the magic solution yet.
2,Nice pillow. NOT FIRM.,"The pillows were nice but were just too soft- definitely not firm. I bought two FIRM foam pillows at Bed Bath and Beyond a few years back, but they are compressing and becoming flatter...too flat for allergy-ridden side sleepers like me. Unfortunately, BB & B doesn't carry them anymore. Too bad these didn't do the trick. Time to keep looking..."
1,pillow,The pillow was made in China. Was too hard and too high. Not usable. Took a chance and bought it because the place I last purchased one no longer had anything like this.
2,No Support,"This pillow does what many down or puff filled pillows do, it squashes down too much. There is no support for your neck and the pillow does not feel firm at all. If you are like me and like a high loft pillow, do not buy this product."
4,Good for people who suffer from allergies....,"After looking at Memory Foam pillows at a local store, I decided they were too expensive--even on sale. I used an Amazon gift certificate for this pillow and am really glad I did. Not only is it comfortable, but I haven't suffered as much with my allergies. It comes with a very nice pillow cover which is machine washable. Give it a try!"
2,"Too hard, too high",I am a side sleeper and took a chance at this pillow. I've been told to get firm support for side sleeper but this pillow is too firm and too high and doesn't work for me. I get neck pains in the morning.
5,Best pillow I have ever used!!! (side/back sleeper),"After owning this pillow for over 6 months, I can officially say this is the best pillow I have ever owned or used anywhere! I LOVE IT! I am mostly a side sleeper and this pillow is great. However, it is not exactly firm....it has a good amount of 'give' to it. I am a man with broad shoulders requiring a taller pillow so, when sleeping on my side, I place a thin pillow under this pillow to give it more height. This works wonderfully! When sleeping on my back, this pillow is perfect by itself. Overall, the most comfortable pillow ever. The best!*Due to the amount this pillow 'sinks' or 'gives', if you are a side sleeper, you may need a separate thin pillow under this one (not in the same case though!) in order to have the desired height. Though thick, this pillow compresses a good amount once you lay your head on it."
1,"Don't Buy This Pillow!!! (Purchase Date Oct 25, 2012)",This is the WORST Chemical Laden Smelling Pillow that I have ever purchased in my whole life..Don't waste your money...I have thrown this pillow in the trash because the smell was so bad...I believe that I received an old knockoff instead of a real Talalay Latex Pillow...
5,So Comfortable,"Wow, I finally found a pillow for my big head, just kidding on the big head. This pillow is not to firm and not to soft. Like Goldie Locks put it, ""It's just right!"""
2,They sent me two different pillows,"I ordered this item first in 2010, and I love it.Love, Love, Love it.5 stars all the way.After I got married, I ordered another one for my wife so she would stop borrowing mine - but it was a completely different pillow.The one I ordered in January 2012 is much softer, lower volume, and not particularly good.Since it seems that this one is the pillow being shipped now, I'd give it two stars.I certainly wish I could get another one like my first one, but that seems unlikely"
4,great pillow,good support. keeps it's shape. very happy with the purchase.I would recommend it to anyone who is in need of a supportive pillow.
3,It's okay.,"I have been a on a great pillow search. I am an overweight side sleeper who has neck problems. So, I need something that is high profile, flexible, and firm. Like pretty much all of the latex pillows made now days, this pillow is not firm. Apparently this is because they don't make latex pillows as dense as they used to. Of all the latex pillows I've tried, I like the springiness that I have come to love in latex pillows, but it falls short in the firmness and profile department for me.If you need something that is both firm and has a high profile, this one is not for you."
2,Foam just not the same,I was disappointed in the pillows because the solid latex foam was not the high quality I expected from Simmons.
2,didn't like it,"I woke up to pain in my back and neck, my lady didn't like it either. I'm a back and side sleeper. You should try to test it out first."
2,Not Impressed,"I purchase the latex pillows due to a neck injury, i can not use down or pillows that do not bounce back in place when you move your head. I have purchased these types of pillows in the past. However this pillow is a little different as it is really a firm hard pillow, not at all like my others that are softer, which were listed also as firm. This really is a HARD pillow. it's very springy... but's it is also HARD! I read the description thoroughly, and spoke with a representative, and purchased the pillow based on the conversation (wish i had not), however it is too hard for me."
1,Bouncy,"After reading the great reviews of this pillow, I decided to give it a try. Big mistake. I tried sleeping on it four nights and each night my neck and shoulders would get more and more sore.It is a rather strange pillow as it bounces, but I guess that is what rubber does.It also makes your head hot.Maybe great for some, but not me."
2,Not a Firm Pillow,"I read reviews on this pillow and hoped it would be a FIRM pillow as stated. It is not firm at all, feels like I am sleeping on a flat wad of foam. Unless you are a tiny person, this pillow will not support your head and neck if you are a side sleeper. Very disappointed in this name-brand product."
5,Great pillow and price!,Just what I was looking for! Great pillow would not want anything else to sleep on! Love Latex!
3,Not as good as the 100% latex pillows,"I have a two-zone, 100% latex pillow that I needed to replace. I thought I'd try this lesser expensive one, but it's not the same at all. The less expensive one is more like foam than latex and is warm to sleep on. The more expensive ones are heavier, more like soft rubber, and cooler to sleep on. I'm not sure how to describe it. I like the more expensive one is better, in my opinion."
3,"Not for me, It's like sleeping on a balloon","Length:: 2:55 MinsI found that this product had no real description of how it felt. I have not slept on a latex pillow so this was new to me. I didn't like how it felt and it was a bit weird to sleep on. Almost like sleeping on a balloon. From all of the great reviews I was expecting something much better. I can't say this is a bad pillow due to the fact it does offer good support but being a smaller person, this pillow just felt too big and pushy. I guess latex pillows just aren't for me. I wanted everyone to understand what it means when people say this pillow is springy so I hope this helps. You never know until you sleep on one whether or not you'll like it. I also want to note this pillow is larger than a standard queen size pillow. It was 4 inches larger than my other pillow and barely fit into the pillow cases."
5,The most wonderful pillow ever!,"I've been looking for a foam pillow, remembering as a teen I had one and loved it. I never can find a good pillow--my neck hurts, my TMJ would get worse, or my ears would be sore. I have had a very hard time finding a good one, and was thrilled when I found this on amazon. Latex foam pillows are far superior in comfort to the popular ""memory foam,"" which I think is so uncomfortable--I mean, it smooshes down and stays there--how is that support? Latex foam, on the other hand, is light, but so supportive. It's springy--it's gently lifting you up. Anyway, I've had it for about a week and slept better than I have in years. I absolutely love it! Also, I can't believe how fast I got it. When I ordered it it was out of stock, and I chose free shipping. Had it in a few days. Wow! Thanks Amazon. (PS The latex smells a little funny at first, but the smell was completely gone within a few days.)"
2,Inconsistent product quality,"Due to minor neck pain, I was looking for a pillow that would support my neck when I sleep on my back. I purchased this pillow in November of 2008 and really liked it. It was firm, supportive, and exactly what I was looking for in a pillow. However, when I purchased the same pillow from Amazon in March, 2009 for my wife, it was vastly different. The second pillow was packaged in the same wrapper and had the same labels, but had absolutely no support or firmness. Unlike the first pillow, this one flattens down paper thin and really doesn't function as a basic pillow. My guess is that the company (Simmons) has problems with quality control. Because Amazon will not allow you to return opened products, my advice is to give this pillow a try, but avoid removing the plastic cover until you determine whether you receive the paper-thin variety or the supportive variety."
2,Too Soft,"I've been sleeping on foam rubber pillows for the better part of my 51 years. I purchased 2 of these pillows in king sz. I was disppointed in how soft they are.Normally when you get a new foam pillow you have to go through a short periodof ""breaking it in"" because they are somewhat stiff. I don't mindthat b/c I know I'm going to have good head and neck support for years to come.Not so with these Simmons Beauty Rest pillows.They claim these pillows are FIRM foam.This is not the case at all.This is the same density of the old foam rubber pillows I am replacingwhich I've slept on for 10 years.So my $70 for pillows down the drain.If you want a good foam rubber pillow that is firm and gives good firmsupport, this is NOT the pillow for you."
5,Finally!!,"Finally!! After purchasing all the ""hype"" pillows, and throwing them in back of closet, I found this! It is cool, keeps shape, comfortable, and looks good. Added bonus: Made in USA!"
5,Loe these pillows,"Great pillow for squeezing, resting your head and I love them (have more than one) They have held up well...I have had my older ones for over 5 years.I am not allergic to them. They do not get lumpy either like many other pillows I have owned. I highly recommend them."
4,Dreamy....,"I've slept on a Latex Foam pillow since a very young age. For a couple years I was without one, figuring any old pillow would do. Since getting this pillow, I can't imagine ever sleeping without it! I'm sleeping better than ever, it's hard to get out of bed in the morning. I do wish it was just a little thinner, for me it's a little thick, but still, I love it!"
4,Pretty good,I am happy with this pillow. Comes back to shape and doesn't bunch like regular pillows. Worth the money.
2,Half as good as I expected it to be.,My wife and I have been buying solid foam pillows for many years. Prior to getting them online we would purchase them from Sears. Since Sears no longer has them in their stores I decided to purchase them from Amazon. This was half of a good idea since only one of the two pillows were as firm as it should have been.Both of the pillows state that they are Firm but one is clearly not. It is very soft and does not hold my head up. You can also feel that it isn't as heavy as the pillow that is correct.I am disappointed in the obvious lack of consistency from pillow to pillow.I would have sent the bad pillow back but my wife said that she would use it as is.It is very unlikely that we will buy another of these from Simmons in the future.
2,I'm returning it,I bought this because I have trouble with my ears getting sore when I sleep on my side and this was supposed to be good for a side sleeper. First of all the smell is just awful! I would highly recommend airing this out for a few days before using. And it made my ears even more sore then the memory foam pillow that I already have so am sending it back.
2,not as described. flat and smelly too.,"this pillow isn't firm. i watched a video that someone posted and got excited. i have no idea what pillow was in that video, but it's not the pillow they sent me. it's flat. it stinks too. i'm sending it back. i need a pillow for shoulder pain and having a very hard time finding one that works."
2,Half my order was as expected!!,"After sleeping on these pillows at a friends we decided to order a set for ourselves. I ordered two, and one is much firmer than the other. I'm disappointed that the product is not as described and that quality control is poor!"
3,Too thick....,"I really WANT to like this pillow. I like the ""springiness"" of the latex, and find the support to be excellent. But it's just too thick. My head and neck are being bent upwards, and I am waking up with a sore neck and shoulder. I'm 5'5"", perhaps a taller person would find the pillow size to be perfect.I've been using the pillow for a week, thinking I might get used to it, but woke up again with very sore shoulder and stiff neck. It's quite disappointing, and if I return the pillow, it will cost a lot to ship. So I feel stuck with it."
2,beautyrest pillow,"I've had a beautyrest latex foam pillow for about 5 years, and really like it. I've been looking to replace it with a new one, so I was glad to find it on Amazon. Although the one I've had must be regular support because I ordered the firm support latex pillow & it was too firm for me. I returned it only because I need a softer pillow with more spring in it. I've been happy with the one I already own, I just need to find the same support to replace it with. The firm support felt too hard."
2,Too large,"Expected a little more give--am trying to replace an older foam pillow that would give and support well. This was too big, too hard."
4,Good Pillow Does the Job,I am a foam pillow sleeper for many years. Lately it has been difficult to find a good foam pillow and when you did it cost a king's ransom. This pillow is nice and full and didn't cost too much. I am happy....zzzzz
5,Most comfortable pillow I've ever owned!,"Soft yet firm, and comfortable, no matter where you place your head or how you sleep. This is a nicely made pillow and a great value for you buck. I'm so glad I bought this."
4,Simmons Pillow,"Pillow is very good quality, a little more firmer than I would have liked. I have several of these in the queen size, but needed a King and think I need to find one in a medium firmness."
3,not very firm pillow,"this pillow is labeled as firm foam. It is foam, but it is not firm. It is quite soft and does not give me the support I was expecting."
1,"No Supports, just bouncy.","I will not recommend this product if you are looking for supports, especially for $58. I returned the product the same day."
3,Not a firm pillow,"I have been sleeping on a latex pillow for the last 30 years. This pillow was advertised as firm latex. It is anything but.....it is soft yet bouncy. It is a ""cool"" sleeping pillow. By that I mean your head does not sweat. However it does sink into the pillow because it is not firm. I am now using my old pillow once again, [it is 9 years old] because it has more stability than the new one.If you want a bouncy pillow, this is for you, if you want a firm latex pillow it is NOT for you."
2,Not High Quality,"I have previously had a latex pillow, but was disappointed with this one as it doesn't seem to be as dense and hefty as my last one. My head ""sinks"" in it too much. Feels cheap."
2,Not firm at all--this should be rated differently,"The pillow is not what I would consider firm. It was a soft pillow without any odor or fragrance. I have used a water pillow for a few years and will probably go back to one, as they are affordable on Amazon. No problems other than the product is not what is advertised."
3,Good pillow...needs to be a,"Good pillow! Needs to definitely be thicker. Haven't had it for more than about 3 months and already feel that it's flattening out a bit. I have always preferred latex foam pillows; They have more support for your neck and last much longer than any other pillow I have EVER tried. Especially when buying a order online; look for Customer AND Editorial Reviews. Editorial reviews give you more informative facts; while customer reviews give you a variety of perspectives on the product. I have Fibromyalgia, for example, and another customer was thoughtful enough to include how this pillow benefited patients with Fibro."
2,Not a FIRM Pillow,I think it is a quality pillow but it is not FIRM as the add suggests. I have owned several latex pillows in the past and I would rate this pillow a '2' on a scale of 1-5 with '5' being extra firm and '1' being very soft. The price was good and I will keep it for a guest pillow and try to find a 'FIRM' latex pillow elsewhere.
2,Not a good alternative for Down pillow lovers....,"I was looking to upgrade some aging pillows of mine so I ordered this pillow on account of the overwhelmingly positive reviews and the reasonable price. I really enjoy the comfort of Down pillows, but unfortunately they aggravate my allergies. I was hoping this pillow would be a good alternative, but instead it was not for me. The pillow has way too much spring for my tastes. It's not hard as others have described. However, if you push it down and let go, it will quickly spring back. It almost feels if the inside material is mixed with air. It feels overly synthetic and makes my neck hurt when I rest on it. I am hoping to find a pillow with a more natural feel, but that is hypoallergenic. The buckwheat pillow seems promising."
5,The BEST pillow,"Bought this January 2010. Still LOVE it!It doesn't lose it's shape or flatten. My last pillow cost more and started to flatten, but it died in the washer.This you don't need to wash. Just the zippered cover and your pillow case.Though be careful removing it. It is very ""grippy"" and my corner tore a lil from tugging at it to get out. It is made with holes all over so they may tear if you pull too hard. I let it air-out a couple days just in case. No issues with smell for me.I sleep amazingly on it. After sleeping elsewhere, it's like a supportive cloud when I get home. I take it with me and contemplate getting another to leave elsewhere, but think it will be confiscated haha.-30 year old guy"
1,Awful,"This pillow is awful. It smells like a condom, is far too soft, and your head rolls off it. Don't let the expensive price fool you - I would have been better off buying a pillow for five dollars. Worst purchase ever."
1,Uncomfortable,I have been ready for a new pillow for a long time. I read all the reviews on line for months. I finally made a decision to purchase this pillow. What a major disappointment!! I would not recommend this pillow to anyone. Uncomfortable for weeks. Finally had to take pillow off bed. Now very happy. Recommend all people looking for a great pillow to buy a pillow from Hampton.comThe best pillow on the market is at Hampton.com
1,"Smelly, stinky pillow","I don't know why Simmons (maker of mattresses) decided to team up with Dunlop (maker of tennis balls). The result is a jiggly pillow that stinks like a fresh pack of tennis balls. The smell isn't readily apparent when you first get them... it sneaks out after your head has been moving around on it for a few hours. The first night I used it, I woke up with a headache and was nauseated.Unless you have no other choice, I would recommend any other product."
3,Not For Me,"Love my latex mattress, but the experience doesn't transfer to the pillow. It's too soft and ""rubbery"", bouncy. A firm down pillow beats it."
4,good pillow....little too firm,"I bought a latex pillow at JCPenney a few months ago, because it was on sale and with an additional % off. My husband slept on it one night and wanted one. I was not able to get another at JCP for the same price, so I looked online. I read the details very carefully to find a pillow with the same ""materials"". I thought this one was identical, so I ordered it. My husband likes it, but it is firmer that the one I have. I would have sent it back, but he says it's okay. If you like really soft pillow, don't get this one."
4,6 Months Later,"When I first got this pillow I liked how it didn't sink in like other pillows do. But I found it was making me wake up to kinked necks...and that's not fun at all. After about a month, it finally flattened down a little so that it wasn't so bad of a sleep. I like my pillow 6 months later...it's firm, it's supportive, and I actually own 5 more :)"
4,great pillow,Firm. Holds it's shape. Been buying a pillow every year for my husband. He seems to get them flat in no time. I've been using a foam pillow for AGES. My ears hurt with most other pillows. Encouraged him to try this one. He is pleased. Amazon prices were the best I found. My pillows last for YEARS (10+). Hope this one does too. Seems like the same fabrication material.
3,shipping! uck!,"the pillow isn't tooo bad. its just a little smaller than i had hoped and not as firm either. My complaint though is that it came nicely sealed in a box, but the pillows bag was under the pillow crunched in a corner of the box, and the nice cloth zippered cover has black curly hairs all over it! surprised, i started to question my purchase, wondering if i had accidentally purchased used? so i looked over my printed receipt and went back into my order online, and no i purchased ""NEW""! i went online to email amazon on the packaging feedback and have never heard back from anyone! its been almost 4 weeks ago! i paid almost $30 for the pillow! ""NEW""!"
3,"Started out great, went down from there","When I received this pillow, I was absolutely excited. I am a side sleeper, and it is so hard to find a supportive pillow. This fit the bill, for about 2 weeks. Despite the claim that it doesn't deflate, it did deflate on me. Not by too much (nothing, compared to a down pillow), but enough to be noticed. Also, it has holes all over it, which is great for allowing air to flow through, but I have noticed that I have tears forming around the holes. This is after only 28 days. I am not sure about the longevity of this pillow. I love that it is great for allergies, mites, etc. It is a comfortable pillow, just not fantastic. I wound up ordering the Simmons Coil one, and I love it (although it really is HUGE). I'm not sure that I would buy this pillow again, but I will continue to use it in conjunction with the Simmons, which has become my primary pillow."
1,Inaccurate King,"I ordered a king size which stated as 18x36. When the product arrived, the foam size is measured only 18x28 only the foam case is 18x36. Misleading product - don't buy it."
4,Perfect support,"I really like this pillow. It is just what I was looking for. It is firm and supportive, but also soft. It does smell when you first open it. You have to let it air out a little. Then I rubbed a little scented lotion on it before I put it in the pillowcase. Now it actually smells nice. I bought one of these at a fancy furniture store and it was $55. Much better price on Amazon!"
4,Product dimensions are listed incorrectly!,I got the standard size.....product decription said the product dimensions for the standard are 24 x 15.7. Got the pillow the actual size according to the tag on it is 26 x 18. Amazon.....update the product dimensions please!! Otherwise love the pillow it could be a bit more stablized when laying on it b/c if u sleep with someone and they move around the latex foam is really bouncy and ur head bounces around. Sure wish Tempurpedic made an extra firm memory foam pillow! I have a memory foam mattress topper and really love it.
3,High Quality...But Firm And A Little Hot,"The title of the pillow does not say firm in it. This is a very firm and pretty thick pillow. I own the regular version of this pillow also. For me the regular feel is the perfect. Only thing about the latex is it's a little warmer than normal pillow materials. If you're a pillow flipper always looking for the cool side, you might want to consider something else. I ended up giving the regular one to my wife who loves it. The firm one hasn't found a steady home yet. The quality is top notch though. I believe these pillows will last for many years. We've owned and used the standard feel pillow for about 2 years and still like original condition."
3,not what I wanted,"I left my perfect latex foam pillow at a rental home on vacation. I ordered this one hoping it would be the same, but it is not. It is too heavy feeling and hurt my neck. I wanted a springier softer one. It also seemed small in the standard size."
2,Not a firm pillow,I was very disappointed. I was expecting a firm pillow. I'm not sure I would call this even medium support.
5,The BEST pillow EVER!!,"I have had this pillow for over a year and I love it. I wanted something that would last longer than the standard pillows I kept replacing which lost its shape over time. This one never loses it's shape. It firm enough, but the weight of your head does make it go down slightly and provides very good support. I was scared that I was going to wake up with a stiff neck the first week. I love putting my head down to sleep on this pillow every nite. It's dreamy...hahah.. Someone described it as springy. Yes, but it's not like your head bounces on it. It's just good firm support. Do not expect your head to be lost in squishiness/fluffiness. It's just good support. I LOVE IT and recommend it to anyone trying to make the jump from the standard pillow to a latex foam pillow! :)I paid $31.99 during a ""lightning deal""."
5,Ahhhhhh!,My husband and I are spoiled to latex foam pillows. So comfy. These are good quality and keep shape. We replaced our set and use the old ones in shams because they still hold their shape. Love them!
4,Not consistent,I ordered four of these pillows in the standard size. Two were firm and two were fairly soft (all in packages labeled firm support). I've decided to keep them as I don't mind the variety but I think this helps explain the mixed reviews.
4,Huge fan of latex foam,For the first 2 weeks or so I really wasn't ecstatic about these pillows. They had a funny smell which I was disappointed took so long to disappear.(not headache inducing or anything but you could always smell them going to bed) The other issue I had was that I have been a side/stomach sleeper and the pillows are just too thick and springy for a stomach sleeper. The pillows actually started to train me to sleep on my side more. While it was annoying for the first few nights I slowly found myself falling asleep faster and never waking up with a back ache because I wasn't sleeping on my stomach too much.All in all a positive experience and I really like how supportive the pillows are.
4,not supportive enough,"Had a foam pillow growing up, once my big head laid down I was out. Been trying to replace it for years. No pillow I have found has given me the same comfort or support but this one comes close. Its a specific feeling for each person but this one should work for a lot of people. Best of the ones I have tried."
1,Very dissapointed; these are not firm pillows,"We bought a set of talalay latex firm pillows a couple of years ago & we love them. These were bought in Houston, but we now live 150 miles away from the store from which they were purchased, therefore decided to order the Simmons ""FIRM"" talalay latex pillows online.They arrived yesterday & I immediately knew by the weight & flimsiness of these new pillows that they were not of the same quality, nor were they anywhere close to being ""FIRM"".A great disappointment, since we have out of town guests arriving in a few days, and I'd hoped to use them in the guest room.I'll definitely be returning these pillows."
3,Why so many different reviews? Not all of the pillows are the same,"I have been meaning to write this review for 2 months, but only get reminded at the very end of the night as I go to bed and lay my head on this pillow. I bought 2 of these pillows 2 months ago, and can tell you that they are 2 VERY different pillows. One is firm but spongy while the other is soft and spongy. I ordered these two at the exact same time (both new) and can tell a very distinct difference between the two.These pillows are ok, but this just serves as a precautionary review- always buy a pillow you can feel before buying. Reviews will only take you so far. In this case, they probably won't take you anywhere because who knows what kind of pillow you will end up getting.In case you were wondering- I checked the tags and everything had the same information on it. I tested the firmness of these pillows with several people and each person indicated that they could tell a distinct difference between these pillows."
3,disappointed,"Received wrong size, returned and again received wrong size.My computer was down for several days and there was no way otherwise provided to complain.Finally had to contact the credit card company . They gave me a phone number to call.When I finally got them on the phone, they could noy have been any more understanding and accommodating ."
1,Pillow too firm,"This pillow was too hard for me. I have purchased other Simmons latex pillows and some were harder than others...maybe they are all different because some listed as ""firm"" are supportive but still comfortable. This one hurt my ears and head. Still searching for that balance of supportive yet soft latex pillow....."
1,Foam pillow,"Unfortunately, this pillow, although latex foam and that is what I wanted, was just too large, too dense and I didn't like it. . .even after reading umpteen reviews where most were favorable. I ended up purchasing another pillow elsewhere. If the pillow had been half the size, I would have liked it. This type of pillow is extremely hard to find."
2,not good,No support at all. This product is not correctly described and should be avoided unless you have company coming to stay that you don't like. This pillow will help their stay be short.
2,latex pillows,"The pillows arrived in torn open original plastic wrap and appeared to have been returned items slightly dirty, The shipping costs of over $20 was way over priced and We could have paid about $2 more and gotten them with out shipping charges.Ray Anders"
3,Good pillow,"Good pillow at a decent value. It is a little less supportive, less firm, than I prefer, but still a decent pillow at a fair price."
2,Too soft,"Very dissapointed! This is not a firm,it is soft and very thin. At best,you can use it for a small body pillow. It had a bad smell out of the box too,pu!"
5,Pretty either dressed up or down,These earrings look terrific with pants and a nice top or perhaps dressed up a bit more. They are simply comfortable and pretty - and priced right.
5,easy to use,"it stuck to the floor,but peels up easily. worked great making grout lines on my floor.plan to buy more for future projects."
3,Scores for imaginary movies,"Near as I can tell, ""The Pink and Purple World of Dishonesty"" is an unpublished novel or screenplay by Tom Fazzini, vibes player for Small Good Thing. We get a brief excerpt in the liner notes of a story that seems to be about vice cops in a gritty city somewhere.This CD, perhaps, is the score to the film. It's an ambient wash of lounge jazz, sounding like the score of every noir film you've ever seen. At moments lovely, at moments tedious, it's closest to Badalamenti's work on the Twin Peaks score. Only, without David Lynch to capture your attention, you can get a bit lost in soft soundscape.""Pink and Purple World of Dishonesty"" is a bit of a surprise if you'd been exposed to Small Good Thing through their work on ""Slim Westerns"", a lovely sonic stroll through the American Southwest. Then again, it's really the same idea - a soft, distant take on well-worn cliches."
2,Rainbow Milk Thistle Plus,"I liked the fact the product was ""food based"" and I don't have any complaints about the effectiveness of the product, but the pills are so large I choked on them. For me, a gel cap or smaller pill would be much better. I had to change to a different brand because I was becoming concerned one getting stuck in my throat."
2,Pills too Big,"I am taking these pills but have to smash them, then gag them down. Why doesn't the company make it in a gel capsule form..I will be looking for another company that does. The ingredients are great but if you can't swallow what good are they."
2,Not that good. Racheting mechanism is stiff and course.,"For a 1/4"" rachet, it's almost useless. The Tee handle is great, but the backforce is so high with this rachet you'll find yourself unassembling things more than assembling. Really a let down."
5,Convenient and Accurate,"This monitor is easy to use, quick, and has convienent buttons and numbers. Overall I was very pleased with this purchase. The only thing different tidbit I would like to see is the adapter plug should be in the back of unit."
1,Diastolic Reading Inaccurate,"I took the meter to my doctor's office to compare it's reading to a cuff & stethoscope reading. On two attempts with two different cuffs, the meter was off. The bottom number (diastolic) was much lower than the cuff reading."
5,Blood Pressure Monitor,"Omron HEM-773AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with Easy-Wrap Cuff and IntelliSenseWorks GREAT! Needed the larger cuff for Husbands arm. No issues. The Doctor felt this was a good choice when I took to appointment to show him how I used it. It was on the money with what they got when checking my BP. So, we feel it is a very accurate unit. The cuff is tricky to wrap when doing yourself, but with practice gets easier."
3,good unit; wall wart generates lots of elf/emf,"This is a very good blood pressure unit, easy to use, comfortable. It never over inflates - other units occasionally decide to use a second reinflation cycle, which way over inflates and hurts.The only complaint that I have with it is that the wall wart it comes with generates a huge amount of elf/emf (whether the unit is in use or not). So, I'd suggest keeping the wall wart (not necessarily the bp unit itself) at least 4 to 5 feet, maybe more, away from your head while sleeping. I have measured the wall wart that comes with the hem 780 to generate much less elf/emf. Unfortuneatly the 780 does occasionally overinflate, which I hate. Also, the 773 uses a separate on and off button from start, and the 780 uses only one button, a bit less user friendly."
4,blood pressure monitor,Am satisfied with this product as it lives up to its customer reviews and ratings. Easy to use and store.
4,Good for a couple,"My husband and I both watch our blood pressure and wanted one with a memory for two people. At first, I wasn't sure if I liked the larger case, but after using it awhile, I do like that there is storage space for the cuff. Makes it very neat and portable. My only compliant is the cuff doesn't fit well at end of wrap. May fit a larger person."
4,Omron HEM 773 Deluxe Blood Pressure Monitor,"I've used Omron Auto inflate Blood Pressure Monitors for about 20 years. This my second unit. The units are very accurate, durable, and as a rule easily used. This new unit has a semi pre-formed cuff which I find harder to get properly fitted on my arm and occasional error messages appear. Outside of this, it is an excellent unit, compact and accurate!"
3,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING...NOT ACCURATE,"I've been using the Omron HEM 773AC for five months and am somewhat disappointed in that the readings, based on what my doctor's office finds, are not accurate. It reads considerably lower than my actual B/P. I can get an more accurate reading by carefully watching the monitor for the ""heart beat"" indicator to appear after the cuff cuts off flow. But the meter always reads much lower... for example when I observe the ""hear beat"" return at 130 the meter will read 100 to 110.The lower pressure I have no way of determining but I suspectit is always a little low, maybe by ten numbers. On the positive side the unit is easy to use and I am getting an ideaof what raises my B/P.I think three stars is more than fair for this machine."
3,"Easy to use, excellent features, but not real accurate","I found the Omron HEM-773AC automatic blood pressure monitor easy to use and a good indicator of blood pressure trends. I compared readings taken at the doctor's office and found my readings to be some what higher. I found the lack of repeatability to be an issue when taking several readings back to back. The accuracy may be lacking, but it served well as a general indicator of blood pressure trends. I like the easy wrap cuff when taking readings. The numbers in the readout are large and easy to read. The memory feature allows the user to store up to 20 readings including the date and time for two people. The ability to plug it in a wall outlet or use batteries is a real plus. Overall I feel this monitor is a good buy considering price, accuracy, and customer friendly features."
3,"eh, it's all right","Overall this product is just OK. I got a great deal on it (on sale, plus a $10 instant rebate, and I had gift certificates).What I don't like about it is that #1: I feel like it's not accurate. I've been borderline HBP for a couple of years and now this machine gives me perfect readings. (119/79, 120/80, 117/78 to name a few) and #2: I often need a 2nd person to help me put the cuff on, otherwise it doesn't get as tight a fit. My dad has an older model where the cuff wraps around and slides through a metal loop so you can get a bit of leverage when you're putting it on with your other hand. This cuff is a little more awkward.I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, let's just say that."
2,Grey noir,"Though published in 1997 I'm surprised it's still available and quite cheaply, too. The bulk of the book is devoted to thirty-six classic noir movies with background information but the main point of the title are the posters and lobby cards. The large page size means that the images get the size they deserve but here's the problem: they have been printed in three colors instead of the four that normal color work is done in. The missing color is black and I find this very odd because black has been used to print the headings and text.The missing black means that the dark and black areas in the posters just looks insipid and sort of very dark grey. The vibrancy of the posters has been ruined to my mind! I'll stick to my favorite noir poster book:Art of Noir: The Posters And Graphics From The Classic Era Of Film Noir, by Eddie Muller.***SEE SOME INSIDE PAGES by clicking 'customer images' under the cover."

2,It is copy right protected and you cant rip it in your Ipod even though u legally own the cd,"If you want this just to play in your car then BUY IT !! If you are like me and a HUGE dido fan and want that one song PARIS in your Ipod then DONT BUY IT as it rips in but wont play back properly. I even deleted the tune and restarted the computer and tried two other times !!! It also has media that promts to a web site and you need to download additional software to play that part.unlike a DVD that just simply ""Plays"". All in all the song paris isnt on her ""A"" list or her ""B"" list for that matter. Skip this one.. Want Mine ??? I dont. John S. Reynolds- Santa Barbara"
5,HELP out of Hell,This book was real help to get out of the Hell my family has been in since falsely accused of abuse. The irresponisible therapists have NO idea the pain they have caused.
5,Making sense of senseless cruelty,"Those so called ""professionals"" of the cottage industry called ""childhood sexual abuse"" should be forced to read this book before lunging foward to ""save"" more kids. The witch hunt we've seen in this nation makes Salem look like a tea party. Beautifully written, well researched, heartbreakingly fair - the enemies of critical thought and careful observation will hate this book."
1,Misquotes galore,"I challenge anyone to look up the so-called quotes and references. This book misquotes constantly and twists information mercilessly. On the other hand, it is a terrific book if you are a child molester."
3,The item does what it should,the titem worked but seemed a somewhat cheaply made. And i washed it and didnt get all the water off i guess and started to turn alittle brown
4,Sadly beautiful,"I know, I know, I only gave this disc 4 stars (5 seems to be the standard here). Reason being, this month saw the release of ""Shaming of the True"". If you can find it, THAT is KG's 5-star album. But this one is also truly wonderful. From the delicacy of ""Tears of Audrey"" to the witty ""When You Give Your Love to Me"" to the hyper-literate and hyper-thoughtful ""Goodness Gracious"" (I get choked up every time I hear that line about ""when my hair starts to grey"", knowing that it never will) to the flat-out psychotic ""Shadow Self"", this is an album that just gets better and better. It's also sad, knowing that we will never see the likes of this phenomenal artist again. R.I.P. Kevin, your legacy lives on."
3,A cry for help....,"Almost as tragic as the loss of the sensationally talented Kevin Gilbert is the fact that the only albums of his that are easily available are the most depressing. For those who are wondering what the fuss is about--why the lyrics are so smart & funny but the music so bleak, RUN do not walk to www.kevingilbert.com where you can (finally!) get a reissue of the Giraffe albums which are smart, funny and among the finest progessive albums by anyone, ever.The stuff on the Giraffe albums is on a par with songs by Todd Rundgren, Brian Wilson, Elton John, Billy Joel--its THAT good. Since no one can help KG now, we might as well enjoy the music he made when he was still able to find his way home. I think he would want it that way. Thanks, Kevin."
5,Don't Wait... Buy It NOW!,"All of the reviews that I've read are right on. The good ones and the bad ones. That's due to the complexity of Kevin Gilbert, his lyrics and his music. If you are musically trained or love layered, well produced, complex music that sounds simple to a simpleton, you'll love Kevin Gilbert's music. If you enjoy lyrics that are so layered that every time you listen to them you come away with a different conclusion, then you'll love Kevin Gilbert. If you enjoy catchy, contagious pop-rock, you'll love Kevin Gilbert. If you've ever been depressed and despondent, felt isolated and confused, you'll love Kevin Gilbert. He's sweet'n'sour. Ying and Yang. Sweet pop with dark lyrics. Dark pop with sweet lyrics. Good God what are you waiting for? Get this album! Also don't miss out on Kevin's rock opera masterpiece, ""Shaming of the True"" and the ultimate, dark, disturbed, alter-ego, Zappa-esk ""Kaviar."""
3,"Starts brilliantly, fades hard","I'm amazed this album gets such high praise. If all of the songs were of the same quality as the first two, then I would agree this is a five star set. But after the brilliance of ""When You Give Your Love To Me"" and ""Goodness Gracious"" this cd goes south. Yes, the other songs are lyrically strong, but musically I find them uninteresting. Ok, Shadow Self is a unique song, but I find I don't enjoy it that much.I would still recommend this cd because of the two gems."
5,Love that Voice!,What a great collection of songs by the gifted and talented Miss Kate Smith. She really can belt out a song with such feeling. The cover has a beautiful picture of Miss Smith with a great big smile! There is no one like Kate!
3,slips down. bunches up. cuts circulation.,"I'm on my feet all day and need heavy duty help with the circulation. I had a similar item from different manufacturer but had it for so long it started to wear out. I bought a medium (I'm 5'5"" 125 lbs) but it was TOO tight. So I bought a large and it fit much better. I like the open toe but don't care for the color. YES, it is BEIGE and ugliest beige I have ever seen. It also slips down and bunches up around the knees cutting the circulation. My suggestion is to get a heavy duty garter belt (not the Victoria Secret kinds...). I wear mine with industrial strength garter belt and it works much better."
2,Country of Origin doubtful,"The picture shows the 4022 with ""Solingen Germany"" marked on the blade. The copy says ""Made in Germany"".This knife is made in at least three factories. Two in Germany and one in a secret country. One of my 4022s was not marked as to country of origin. There are two versions of the German 4022, as evidenced by different markings. Wusthof admits they outsource, even though their site for the Gourmet line says ""Made in Germany"".I have owned the 4022 made in the secret country, and still own and love one of the German-made 4022s. It is the one without the geometric design on the right, and has a date underneath the trident. I like it a lot. It takes and holds a good edge. I do not find its flexibility a drawback, but that is a personal preference for each user. It is a good value for the money.So, shop carefully, and be sure you are getting what is pictured and described here."
3,Loved it until it broke,"Great little paring knife for those with smaller hands. Tang extends 3/4 of the way into the handle and it maintains its edge well.I purchased this on sale (but not @ as low a price as being currently offered @ Amazon) through [...] back in May 2009. It accidentally went through the dishwasher once -- hubby did the dishes-- and was knocked off the kitchen counter onto a wood floor early in the summer with no apparent damage.Was using it this week to peel and dice a raw potato when the handle broke clean through at the last ""rivet"". Although it was sold with a limited lifetime warranty, I haven't been able to find the paperwork in order to return it.I realize it is not a high end knife, but I'm still disappointed that it broke in a little over 5 months of gentle use."
5,"Needed a nice pairing knife, and found it.","Solidly made, keeps a good edge. Good hand feel...hey it's a pairing knife but a good knife is so important to avoid injury. Found it!"
4,Classic not gourmet,"The classic set has been amazing, they do require honing and to keep a razor edge, frequently. I purchased a 3"" paring knife, 4042 and when my 10yo daughter was using it to slice an apple, the last inch of the handle broke transversely and some rust is present. So much for German stainless steel!Update--------------------------------------------Found address for Wustoff USA in CT mailed in knife, got a new one for cost of mailing it in, $1.44. Great customer service."
5,"Wusthof 3"" Paring Knife","The Wusthof gourmet 3"" paring knife has good balance and I am looking forward to the blade and edge holding up as well as our other Wusthof kitchen knives. When ordering I did not notice that the blade was notforged as with the larger knives but it has quality manufacturing detailsthat should give it a long life of hard use."
2,Very disappointed,"Owning a set of Wustoff knives was on my 'bucket list'. So I was really looking forward to these knives. I hand wash my knives immediately after use. A few weeks ago, while cutting up peppers, the handle of the paring knife broke clean in half (I almost lost a finger). As another reviewer stated, it broke just past the second rivet. Not the quality I've always believed Wustoff to be. Flimsy and cheaply made."
5,My review,"I was concerned about the quality of the knife when I ordered it, but I have received the knife and it is much more than what I was expecting. I'm very happy with the product and would get another."
3,Too Thin,Blade is very thin. Very lightweight knife. If you want a thin blade then good but I prefer not to worry about snapping the thing while using it.
5,Negative Dialectics,one of the best books on history of thought and indisputably the best one on frankfurt school.
3,Dated picture book,"I've really enjoyed Peter Garrison's aviation writing so I bought this book. Didn't pay much at all for it and got good value, just didn't get much book. His writing is great as always but this was mainly, well written, captions"
1,Not a good product,"I bought one and there is a problem with the USB interface. My Sony VIAO, with Windows XP Pro, complained that it was plugged into a slower USB 1.1 hub. It wasn't.I tried on another computer, also running Windows XP Pro, and after it initially appeared to recognize the drive the computer failed to work with the drive or even recognize it when it was plugged in.I guess I'm lucky. I can return it without any loss of data, since it never worked properly to start with."
1,Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware),"DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT! I bought this particular hard drive while deployed. It worked good for about ten months then went flop on me. I ran several programs on it in an attempt to recover the lost data (approx. 450 GB worth) with negative results. I then tried to contact Maxtor and it's parent company Seagate, to see if they could assist me. They redirected me to their own data recovery service and tried to pilfer anywhere between $1,700 to $2,000 to get the data back for me. Take my advice, BUY FROM A DIFFERENT VENDOR. AVOID BOTH MAXTOR AND SEAGATE ALTOGETHER!"
1,SeaGate Maxtor Stealing Your Money,"Don't rely on SeaGate to help out when your data goes missing. After spending half a day talking to their Indian based tech support and their South African based data recovery all this company could offer me was a polite ""Sorry your data went missing"". It should be the policy of any maker of hard drives to guarantee their product for life regardless of warranty date. Isn't the point of buying a product from a reputable company because you believe they will help you when you need help? Otherwise you might as well buy an external hard drive from the guy on the street."
1,Failed for me as well - BEWARE,Very disappointed in this product. Have many images on this drive and now it's failed. Not sure if I'll be able to recover them. PC's are not recognizing the drive any longer. Would not recommend.
1,Avoid Maxtor,"I bought my Maxtor external hard drive a few years ago. Several months ago it stopped working. I tried it on two different computers and both gave me a message that the computer didn't recognize the hardware device. I changed the USB cord, which didn't work. Plugged and unplugged it and that didn't work either. Went into some online forums, and none of the advice helped. However, I did notice that a lot of other people were having the same problem as me. I think that a company should test a product to be sure that it works properly before putting it on the market. Apparently this company didn't. This is a HORRIBLE, low quality product."
1,Failed,"About 18 months after my initial purchase, the hard drive has failed and will not load up. I'm very angry about this, as 160 gigs of information is a huge amount of information to lose! What a waste."
3,Maxtor PS3200 drive 7200-RPM USB2.0 200 GB,"My died after a few months. Overall it is a great product. Fortunately, it was still under warranty. I should get it back in a few days."
1,I'll never buy a Maxtor/Seagate product again,Nothing new to add or say about this miserable product that hasn't already been said; the hard drive failed just like everyone else's and there's nothing that can be done.
3,"Good Book, wish it had better photos or illustration.","This is a good book with plenty of information about restoring old bikes. I wish the photos or illustration were better. Some photos are such poor copies that it's a wonder why they were included in the book. Otherwise, I appreciate what the author put together."
3,Definitely worth reading,"I am an armchair student of prophecy and it is clear that there a perhaps better books on the subject of eschatology. However, there are no other texts that I have come across that get to the subject of the UPC and it's embedded 666 margin bars better than this one. If one gleans nothing else from this work, then it will have done it's job of illuminating the subtle yet ubiquitous posturing of this emerging world system. This is certainly not one of the ""wacko"" marginal products like the dubious ""Bible Code"" books or movie. It is precise, researched, and where it targets the UPC, on dead center target."
1,Doesn't understand UPC encoding,"I read this or another Mary Relfe book with the same premise--that UPC codes are the Mark of the Beast and contain a hidden ""666"". Her analysis fails to actually comprehend how UPC codes work, and misconstrues the start, stop, and middle separator bars as encodings of 6, which they aren't. An article in the Skeptical Inquirer many years ago covered this issue and accurately explained how the UPC codes work."
1,Bankrupt.,"If you've read Texe Marrs, you are familiar with the game of ""Pin the Tail on the Antichrist."" Mary Stewart Relfe is a master at this game. She can find the numbers ""666"" on a newborn baby's behind, and give you 6 good reasons why you should be afraid. The problem with books like this is that the content is usually dated by the time it hits the bookstores, and what information isn't dated is incorrect. I read this the other day and just shook my head in amazement and disgust: amazement that she could find a publisher, and disgust that there are so many gullible Christians out there buying this junk."
2,Very basic and VERY Disappointing !!!,"I expected much more from this book than I got. This is not a good read for those that have any knowledge of fitness or kinesiology. The quality information was just not there. If you have zero knowledge about periodization, then this book may be an O.K. read for you. I would still recommend against it however. There are much better books out there on periodization than this one. In fact, one of the books is by the authors that did this one. It is called Designing Resistance Training Programs. It is an excellent book ( 5 stars). That is another reason this book was so disappointing. These guys are quality scientists and writers. Unfortunately with this book, it looks like they were just out to make a buck."
2,wrongful sale of vhs tape,"This was described as a used VHS copy of the film Twisted. It actually is not a regular copy--it is one that was made for promotional use only so every now and then up on the screen comes ""PROPERTY OF HEMDALE HOME VIDEO, FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY."" These are not to be sold. This was misrepresented."
2,Go look at in a bookstore first,"So I ordered this book of of the strength of some other DK books that I have purchased for my son. All of the other books I looked at in a bookstore first - this time I did not. So imagine my surprise to find a picture of a dead dolphin floating upside down in a drift net.For me that is not an appropriate image for a child to see. I can understand if they want to bring up the topic, and the other picture of a whale with a drift net where the words say that he breaks free is fine. But a picture of a dead dolphin - the book went staight back to Amazon."
3,"Not a ""silver bullet"" solution","I was hoping this would be the ""silver bullet"" solution for removing rust in all situations. Unfortunately, it's only marginally better than other home remedies. Though this item will take off rust, it appears to only work well for surface type rust off items like silverware or porcelain.I've had just as much luck using home recipes. Do a search for ""rust removal with Borax"" or ""rust removal with white vinegar"". This Naval Jelly works a little better than those recipes, but neither are solutions for deep pitted rust."
5,Great To Remove Rust From Clothing!!!,"I always keep this item on hand because it's the only thing I've ever found that removes rust from everything, including clothing! I have used it for years on just about every fabric to get rust out and it works EVERY TIME without damaging the material."
3,It's okay,I bought this to dissolve the rust underneath my truck. It did okay. The gel did not help with spraying upside down. It also shoots very direct since no spray is available.
1,permatex rust spray,"the spray did not spray good, gummed up sprayed all over....gel spray is a bad idea..i really would like my money back...mick"
1,Not worth to even try,"I used this product according to instructions on the label to remove rust stains from a metal shower rail & did not work at all, I do not recommend anybody to buy it !"
4,nice nostalgia reference,"Enjoyed this video of automotive history. good quality and lots of technical detail on the entire Ford Motor Company's line of auto products. HOWEVER, this tape is identical to Ford Motor's Cars of the 50's. Don't order both."
3,Don't mess with Speed!,"I ran a search at Amazon.com to find any DVD's of Speed Racer. There was a single hit, Speed Racer The Movie. So, I bought it. I was really in the mood to be taken back to my youth and have a great time watching a Speed Racer ""movie."" I knew that I had not actually purchased a ""movie,"" but a collection of episodes...I would have picked a different set by the way....You get the ""Car Hater,"" and ""The Mammoth Car"" (parts 1 and 2). Of the two, the Mammoth Car is the most fun. I particularly like the omnious sounds of the Mammoth Car. The supplemental material comes from one of the first (if not the first) episodes where Speed describes the capabilities of the Mach 5. This is fun, but I would like to see better selections of episodes. Hey, why not put them all on DVD in their proper order like Harmony Gold did for ROBOTECH?"
2,Music Video Was Inappropriate!,"My 10 year old son just received this dvd in the mail and i was looking at it with him, and knowing how much he and his younger brother like to sing the theme song to speed racer, I said ""hey there's a music video - let's watch it"" After a few seconds, I sent my children out of the room while I continued to see what other vulgar scenes were in this thing. The girls in the bathing suits and feeling themselves up in front of my children was very very inappropriate!! This is a child's video for god's sake, can't people leave sex out of anything!!! I plan to write the company that is listed on the back of the video and voice my opinion as well."
3,Jinkies! What's going on here?!,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Scooby-Doo! However, in my humble opinion, the original ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" series is, far and away, the best that Scooby has to offer. So, why on earth did Cartoon Network/Warner Bros. choose to include 2 later episodes featuring Scooby-Dumb? (well, at least it's not Scrappy...) I had high hopes for Scooby on dvd with the appearance of ""Greatest Mysteries"". Now I'm not sure that I trust Warner Bros. to do Scooby justice in his dvd releases... This dvd is not bad, but a true fan of Scooby-Doo will most likely find themselves skipping over the later episodes, and wishing they had gotten their money's worth."
2,Fun,"I rated this 2 stars since I watched it a few then got bored of it. If I wrote this the day I first watched it it would be rated 4. It's very fun, and the bonus episode is great."
4,Cute choices,"I remember these from when I was a kid. For some reason, I thought there were more than 4 episodes on this dvd."
3,Cartoon Network literally killed Scooby Doo!,"I'm a Big fan of Scooby Doo. But I wouldn't I repeat wouldn't buy the DVD.Do not buy the DVD. Order Cartoon Network if you don't already have it. Cartoon Network played Scooby more times than one could keep track of. IF you pay close attention you'll notice that the same episode is played twice in one day or maybe three of four times. I suggest you record the 13 ghosts of scooby doo instead. The monsters are real at least. Tape Ghoul School, Scooby and Relunctant Werewolf and Boo Brothers. Cartoon network will give more than enough hours of scooby till you're either bored or till you're ready to tape it again."
5,Good classic cartoon,Zoinks!This Dvd features 4 classic Scooby Doo Where Are You episodes + 1 bonus halloween day classic episode.3 of the episodes are the 1969 season for me the best and the two other are from 1976 season where the show is called the Scooby Doo Show and features a new character Scooby Dum brother of Scooby Doo.It contains the mexican spanish dubbing as they broadcast in Spain.A classic for any Scub fan.Scooby Doooooo!!!!
2,too short.,"I place the order for the plastic one and the 2 cut out,but they send this one 24"",so I returned because I need the long one,they should specify the size."
5,Awesome Knife!,This is the best knife and a must have for any kitchen. I not only use it for tomatoes...I use it for everything. A very sharp knife and one of my favorites. I love the tip as well. We have owned ours for several years and love it.
4,Cheap sticker... excellent tomato knife,"Very sharp serrated blade out of the cardboard sheath. Not flimsy. Two pronged very sharp, pointy fork tip useful for moving sliced/chopped items around (into a bowl; off the cutting board). Blade is easily made razor/hair shaving sharp with a ceramic steel.I have 2 Wustof Santoku knives: gifts from family. This tomato knife is of similar quality except for the cheap red sticker. Cuts through tomatoes effortlessly; as well as melon, strawberries, peppers, etc... (you get the idea. the blade is very sharp )The knife itself is excellent, but to earn 5 stars for a $30 tomato knife, leave the sticker off and laser brand/imprint the handle or leave it off entirely. The blade is marked indelibly; no reason to cheapen it with a tacky red sticker that is starting to peel on the handle."
2,Except for the one Jim PAGE SONG THE REST WAS pretty bad,Except for the Jim Page song the rest was pretty bad. The artists were not very good and the material sub par
5,Great Fun For All Ages!,"The quest for the kidnapped Prince Froptoppit concludes in this volume. The art and writing by Mark Crilley is superb; Very funny moments effortlessly mix with great suspense, The mysterious Throck's secret is revealed, and there's a GREAT twist involving Alia Rellapor. Crilley is improving as a storyteller with each successive book. This one just zooms along!Fans of the Akiko comics will love this book, and it would make a great read for young fans of Harry Potter."
3,Interesting story,"I was hoping for a little more from this book...maybe a better twist that I didn't see coming from the very beginning. I was a little disapointed there was not more suspense or twists. However, it kept my attention and I did somewhat enjoy it."
3,"Speak Softly, She Can Hear","The book itself was okay. It got better the farther along I got into the book. But, I didn't really care for the first half. I expected better from this book as I thought her first book, ""Perfect Family"" was awesome."
4,Not fantastic...but not bad.,"I bought this book because the summary was interesting to me. I was born in the late 70s, so much of the 60s and early 70s plotlines didn't make sense to me...I have no idea the importance of finishing school, getting into Vassar, blah blah blah. Naomi infuriated me, Eddie made me sick, and I couldn't deal with Carol being such a pushover...but the story kept me reading and the end was FANTASTIC. I recommend reading it just to find out what was really in the character's heads by the end of the story."
1,Author just as bored writing it as I was reading it!,"I thought the plot of the book outlined on the cover sounded like a great story! However, that's the last place I would use ""great"" to describe this book. The story moved along, I thought Carole's character was flat and unrealistic. But at the end, it seemed the author got tired of writing the book, so she ended it. I felt no suspense or anxiety. I read a ""thriller"" to get a thrill. Very disapointed."
3,hmmm,"Although my opinion of the main character in this book is not too different from the opinions in less favorable reviews, I rate the book a bit higher. I was on a week long backpacking trip when I read this. I longed for entertainment in the evening so perhaps that explains the generaous rating. ...like feeding a cracker to a man who hasn't eaten in days...Anyway, I found the plot to be mildly suspensful although quite predictable. I did carry a sense of ""when is it going to happen"" as I turned the pages. The conclusion was satisfactory but as another reader pointed out, the main character's actions should have happened sooner. It was a very easy read that required no effort...perfect after a long day's hike."
2,Didn't even like the main character!,"This book had a very sad main character, Carole. She was weak, not-too-bright, and made too many poor decisions. There was not enough suspense to even make me want to finish this book. I did read it till the end and was glad I did. Spineless Carole finally took some brave measures and that's why I elevated my review to 2 stars."
3,Not Bad.... But Not Great,"I truly looked forward to reading Speak Softly, She Can Hear but was left disappointed. It's an easy-read, but.... not as compelling & riviting as I hoped.Speak Softly started strong, then lulled me to boredom as the weak Carole Mason allows herself to be tortured by the grossly unlikeable Eddie & her supposed friend Naomi. While Carole was understandably scared and vulnerable, she naively allows herself to be tortured by Eddie & Naomi for a good portion of her young life.The story picks up and moves a bit quicker toward the last quarter, has a few interesting twists. But by the end, I was mostly just irritated because the only reason Carole was trapped by her secret was because she allowed herself to be trapped to begin with. Generally speaking, most of the characters were too shallowly drawn to allow the reader to become fully engaged in Carole's story.Although Speak Softly's not bad, it's certainly not great."
3,Enigmatic title does not a good book make,"I was drawn to this novel first because the title piqued my interest. Reading the synopsis interested me even further. I read a few reviews here before I started the book, so I knew going in that there were some mixed reviews.I am another reader who was grossed out by the sordid beginning. Subsequently, the rest of the book petered out in a slow, ice-melting kind of way.A part of me sympathized with the main character, who was but a sheltered 16 year old when she became involved in the crime. Ironically, trying to protect herself and her parents from the crime became the undoing of all of them. Very sad. But another part of me was annoyed with how she let it control her life - she never considered going to the police once to clear her name and her conscience. And by the time she was an adult, why didn't she questions the motives of her partners-in-crime?All in all it was an interesting premise but not a very satisfying tale."
2,Don't Believe the Comparisons,The blurb on the book jacket (Wally Lamb?) declares this book to be similar to Tartt's The Secret History. It is not. Secrets and twisted sex do not *always* make for a good book.
1,boring boring boring,By reading the back of this book its sounds like a great read.This is one of the most boring books that I have read. Please dont get sucked in like I did and purchase this book. After a promising start it fell away.
1,A very sick book,"This was, without a doubt, the most worthless piece of trash I've read in a long time. The reason why it gets one star is because the spelling and grammer was correct throughout the book. By the end of the book I was so disgusted with the main character for being so self-centered. Yes, I finished the book because I finish what I start, but it was a major waste of eye-time. Carole is one of those people you wouldn't hang out with unless she was getting high powered shrink time. Disgusting book; glad I bought it on sale for $1.00 as it wasn't worth any more than that."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Novel","On a dark and stormy night, a horrible accident occurs. A woman is dead, and the survivors decide that it would be in their best interest to burry her rather than calling for help. Sound familiar?Pam Lewis takes a fresh approach to this old tale by illustrating how the cover up effects the rest of their lives. The concept is interesting.Sadly, a great idea does not make a great novel. There is no mystery to the great mystery of the tale, and the main character is the only one who does not see the surprise ending coming from chapter one. The characters are poorly developed, and supporting players are more caricatures than people. Worst of all, the characters are not likeable. The heroine stumbles from one bad decision to another, but not in a misguided and loveable way. Instead, she seems selfish and cowardly. This is the first time I've found myself wishing that the main character would commit suicide and end the suffering of those around her."
4,Keeps You Reading,"Author jumps right into the story...keeps you reading in urgency. Although, by about midway through the book you can pretty much guess the ending, the curiousity factor lies in just how the author is going to pull it all together. I read this book in only two sittings. I have now loaned the book to a co-worker, who is also getting into it quickly."
3,Who is the SHE in the title? And who's speaking softly?,"Seriously, I just finished the book and am not sure of the title's significance?"
3,Poorly done...,"You might want to take this one to the beach. Read it and leave it there. It's poorly done, and very lame. The best way to approach this book is to read the first 50 or so pages (the sex scene) and skip the rest."
2,Hard to finish,"I am one of those people who REALLY try to stick it out to the end. The best thing I can say about this book is that at least it ended in favor for the good guy (if you can call her that).One reason this book did not flow - the characters were very flat, one-dimensional. Over all I thought pretty much every one in the book was a little off, with the exception of Will. Will seemed to be the only level-headed person without deep issues."
5,Tyte,"definitely more electronic/dub than the rest of his offerings...but then again who knows what he would have been doin 9 yrs later, he switched up his style so much its impossible to pontificatebut still distinctive and syncopated rhythms"
2,Lint trap,Did not match up to what was advertised In the amazon write up on this product! I was not pleased with product.
4,frt too high,product is fair quailty but frt was way to high.when i ordered the two products together i figured they would ship together but they did not so it cost 20 bucks to ship these 2 items.not worth it
4,A candid look at boarding school life...,"Casualties of Privilege offers an inside look into some of the dark realities of our nations elite boarding schools. The essays, written by those who have witnessed or participated in the rituals they describe, offer a candid look at a side of the world that few of us ever get to see.I read this book when I was considering the possibility of attending boarding school. At the time, I thought the essays in the book made boarding school look very intriguing. Had my parents seen the book, there is no way they would have even let me apply.Overall a very good book, if an honest portrayal of boarding schools is what you're looking for. For those who may think the subject matter is controversial, open up your eyes and realize that these schools are no different than the rest of society."
2,Shallow,"The basic premise underlying this book of essays written by former prep school students is that there is such a thing as a standard prep school experience. In fact, the term ""prep school"" has been adopted by so many different types of secondary schools as to have become meaningless.Those common threads that do exist (loneliness, use of alcohol and drugs, sex, etc.) are really part of being an adolescent, and are not unique to prep school students, although the young authors of these essays would have us believe otherwise.There is nothing in these essays that wasn't said better by J. D. Salinger in ""The Catcher in the Rye."" Read it instead."
4,All Boarding Staff should read this!,"Whilst this book shows some of the ugly side of boarding schools, it is a 'must read' for anyone working in a boarding school - you will be surprised with what goes on behind your backs!"
3,Fairly good book,"Adolescents are pretty much rebellious. No getting around that. It's natural. It's necessary. It's just part of the process of growing up. However, there are differences between children going through this while living at home and going to a public school verses living at a boarding school. It isn't a major difference, but it does exist and has its own flavor. This book gives you a taste of it from those that experienced it or were experiencing at the time of that the book was published. I found the recommendations given by this book to be sound and reasonable. While I do not view this as a great book, I would recommend it for those thinking of going to a boarding school or sending their child to one. However, I would also recommend you not base your decision on just this book but read several about boarding schools before doing so."
3,Ok book if you have others to get advice from,"This book was good for some very basic info on toddlers. I didn't like the format because it jumped from one thing to another. Most of the info seemed to be geared toward 2 years and up, and the section on feeding was boring. It was mostly about the food pyramid and RDA's. Ugh."
2,Does this woman even have children?,"I'm still reading the book, but already I feel like this woman clearly doesn't have kids...or at least doesn't have one like mine. Do any parents really set up activities for their toddlers such as creating a balance beam for them to practice walking? I chase around my daughter and we do activities as they come. Somehow, even without me following the author's suggestion she's learned to walk, do stairs, pick things up from the floor and stand up without pulling herself up. From this book, you'd think you have to work with your child to accomplish these things.I've loved most of the 'Everything' series, but this one doesn't seem to fit my style of parenting or my child."
3,Didn't like it,"I'm not a parent, but I am a young teacher for toddlers at a daycare center and I was hoping to find some insight to help with teaching our toddlers that have behavioral problems as well as having trouble with toilet training. There was some helpful information with potty training, but other than that, I didn't get much else out of this book.I was also hoping that the book would have a curriculum where I could get some teaching ideas that will go along with their age group. This might be a great book for parents, but I didn't find it very helpful."
4,pretty good.,"i use this and the ""what to expect"" book. they seem pretty similiar. the latter seemed to be the more organized of the two."
3,Toddler Book just an overview,"The book had good advice, particularly Chapter 9, Food Fiesta, with a chart of recommended daily calories and good food suggestions. It is enjoyable simple reading that gives you an overview of what you may experience in the toddler years and how to handle some situations. But overall, it is too general to be the bedside book for most parents."
2,Waste of Money,"I found this book to be a total waste of money. Sure it has a few interesting pieces of information, but nothing I haven't heard before. This book may be useful if you have never had any experience with children. If you have been around children at all, you will find everything in this book to be pure common sense. I was looking for something with more concrete usable information."
3,depression fallout- hoped for a better ending....,"I truly thought (know) this book is amazing...helped me so much...TILL THE ENDING! HAtted the ending...hopping for a better one... this SUCKS! Wanted a happy outcome! WISHING FOR ONE!Be well-Live,love,laugh"
2,disappointed--not what I expected,"While the author's stages of depression that a couple goes through seemed to be pretty accurate, I was very disappointed by the overall tone of the book. It seemed to me that she basically advocated that the non-depressed partner leave in just about all situations.I recently went through an injury which took over 3 months to heal, and during that time, my partner and I went through the stages as described. That's why I was excited about getting this book for both of us to read, so that we could understand why I was depressed and why he was feeling the way he was feeling about our relationship. Instead, the book advocates eventually giving up on the relationship and getting out.Needless to say, my partner didn't need to read that! It didn't really offer any advice about how to work your way back to what you had before the depression-causing event, so I'm giving this a big thumbs down."
3,I didn't know know that,"Two things I didn't know:One, Louis the XIV was guillotined (I somehow got the idea in my head - no pun intended- that it was Louis XVI), and, that Anita Bryant was the widow of John Reed (I thought it was Louise Bryant). Reed, cad that he was, was probably trying to get his hands on as much free Minute Maid orange juice that he could."
1,A Major Disaappoitment!,I had such great hopes for this book and really looked forward to reading it. I could barely make it half the way through when I finally gave up. The prose is turgid with faulty syntax. I often had to reread sentences to make sure I understood what the author was trying to say. I was given the impression that he wrote with authority but found some of his statements and facts to be questionable. The 1930s in Paris deserve a better expose than this.
4,Good but brief review,"This book gives a brief review of life in Paris before World War 2. It covers James Joyce, Reynaud, Bricktop, Joesphine Baker and other. It should have covered more about foreign policy, and incidents such as the assassination of the Nazi diplomat in Paris and Munich. These incidents contributed to World War 2 and The Fall of France to the Germans in 1940."
2,"CUTE, BUT PREDICTABLE","Stephanie is the only Full House girl I like. She's not a cliche like the character of D.J. nor an overadvertised icon like Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen. Jodie Sweetin, the actress who plays Stephanie is cute, smart, savvy and VERY funny. She is the only good thing in this tired, sea of madness of a book.I was glad when Jodie's character was allowed to drop the ""how rude!"" line. It was stupid, not cute or funny and added nothing to the story line of the show. Jodie, as Stephanie is by far and away the most appealing girl on the show. I think she is the brightest."
4,If Only...,"Ryoga. He's the one proposing (If you can believe it, he's so shy!) But really, he's proposing because the Ghost Cat returns (still brideless)and has taken over his body. The movie's ok, but it's not fair!! Ranma should be the one proposing! It's interesting, though, and i would reccomend it for Ryoga and Akane fans."
4,Neat little accessory - not just for sports people!,"Do not believe the myth that these are only for sports people. They are ideal for everyone, in New Zealand (where I live), they are a popular fashion accessory among teenage boys (and sometimes girls). They are lightweight and durable and look pretty cool, with the ide variety of colours available. Only bad point is that dust, lint etc tends to stick to it often."
4,It works if you will.,"Hal Becker's book is the number 1 book for those of you in sales. Persistance, knowledge and courage are the ingredients, and Hal takes the time to help you apply them. This little book is worth more than its' size will convey. IF YOU ARE IN SALES THIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOU IN THE GAME."
5,It is what it is,This filter is a cheaper non-hepa version of the filter that came with this filter. I kept the foaPre-filter from my original filter and put it in this filter.Works great.
1,Gunslinger by Connie Mason,"One star is way too generous for this. Desperado (come on, Desperado?) is a chauvinist pig with no class, intellect, or respect for anyone and Chole is a complete twit who does little more than droll over said pig for the length of the book. Combine that with a complete lack of plot, and this is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. Save your money for anything by Lorraine Heath, Kathleen Kane, Maggie Osborne, or Susan Kay Law. This one isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
4,A decidedly different direction for the Dots,"Chemical Playschool 10 is yet another in a long string of collections of Dots outtakes, improvisations and meanderings. This one is particularly different in that there are a handful of would-be solo pieces by singer Edward Ka-Spel. Apparently their content and mood fit the overall goals of the release, and we should be glad they are included, as the Ka-Spel tracks are perhaps the best on the disc. ""Scarlet Wish"" opens the disc up with one of the best tracks he's recorded to date. On the whole this release captures the gloomier side of the band fairly well, along with their more improvisational moments. ""The Man with the Cut-Glass Heart"" and ""Glasshouse"" are both much obviously darker than the more psychedelic material the Dots had been recording on releases like ""Hallway of the Gods."" On the whole, not quite as massive or all encompassing as ""Chemical Playschool 8 & 9"", but quite compelling in terms of content and mood."
3,"Good Ideas, Taste Super Sweet, Tricks Missing","There's no doubt that Pretty Party Cakes is filled with innovations: edible butterflies, marzipan roses made with edible glitter, petit fours out of Bollywood.BUT there is a heavy emphasis on fondant, an extremely sweet sugar dough that many find inedible, and royal icing, which is basically confectioner's sugar and egg white. In the European tradition, the cake portion tends to be dry.I find some info missing: instructions on how to make mazipan roses leave out stuff like using the edge of a spoon to thin out the edge -- a well-known technique that is necessary to get the results in the photograph. I really find it unacceptable when cookbook authors omit these steps -- the ones them separate their finished results from yours. You're paying big bucks for the book -- they should part with all the secrets.So, buy the book, be dazzled, pick up a few ideas, but go elsewhere for recipes -- and buy other books to expand your knowledge."
3,recycled ideas,"I flipped through this book at our local library. I started out being pretty impressed because the book is nicely done, but then I started seeing a lot of recycled ideas from various American cake and cookie artists. That was rather disappointing."
5,A suspenseful look at Machu Picchu,"I found this documentary to be an excellent introduction to the subject of Machu Picchu and the social structure of the Inca Empire. What particularly impressed me was how the structure of the documentary was set up in such a way that it modeled the process of scientific inquiry: hypothesis, information gathering, and proposed results. It didn't just tell the viewer the ""facts"" of the site but positioned him or her as a scholar testing the the ways that the site been interpreted over the years. I think this would be a good documentary to show a class, as they would get both the information and experience the process of creating and testing information. The music is somewhat History Channel, but I suspect PBS has to do things like that or people won't watch. Pedagogically, it still strikes me as a useful documentary."
4,It was ok just not great,"Generally, PBS puts out some good DVD's but, this one is only average. Since I have no plans to visit Peru anytime soon and the main tourist attention is Machu Picchu this is a good alternative.There is only 60 minutes of film, which is not enough time to really get into the subject matter. I think it should have longer with more information on the work being done to restore the place and any new discoveries."
4,Es Muy Bien,"I enjoyed the ""Ghosts of Machu Picchu"" and would recommend it to those interested in that topic.The great mystery, of course, is how so much was accomplished, so precisely, with so little knowledge and such rudimentary tools.I am always left wishing to know and understand more."
4,Good chlorine dispenser,"I purchased this dispenser for my pool. It works great. The quality of the unit is good. The lid is a little difficult to get on and off. Other than that, it is great."
3,Add 3 Pennies,"Along with only 1, 3"" tablet I started adding 3 pennies. My pool used to have a horrible algee problem; especially after the seasonal rains began. My pool no longer gets ANY algee and I hardly ever need to brush it anymore. The pennies vanish over about a months time but they are very inexpensive to replace. I would have given more stars if they made this floater with a topside that held up better to the sun's UV. They only last a couple years here in South Florida."
2,very cheap and leaks,This is a very cheap product that seems to never really seal well. The adjustment on the bottom is very low quality and looks prone to leaks. I cant imagine any setting on this was accurate at all. For a huge pool you could just throw it in wide open but this was for a spa. It was just too risky to use and over chlorinate. I ended up giving it to a friend with a large pool.
2,cheap knife-,"Do not buy this knife at full price. If this retailed for $54 on Amazon the price was inflated. The knife is thinner and quite lightweight compared to the other Wusthof knives I own, without the flared bolster that is usually between the blade and the tang on a Wusthof knife which gives the blade its weight and heft. The tang is a full tang from end to end, but not top to bottom in the handle. The Gourmet line looks as if as if it were stamped out of a sheet of metal and sharpened. I was at an upscale kitchen store today and they had this style of knife from a higher-end Wusthof line full price for only $44.95, with a flared bolster and full tang. I got this knife on sale but by no means did I get a good deal."
1,doesn't work,Treo 700p willnot sync with this cord. I didn't send it back due to shipping cost exceeding value of cord.
1,"low quality, NOT PALM OEM","This is not a Palm OEM cable and it is low quality. It is a retractable cable form factor and the retract feature stopped working right away. Very thin cable, expect it will fail completely in short time period. Also worth noting that there is NO SYNC BUTTON on the cable.Finally, the photo below is not accurate compared to actual product which I received."
1,Not working with Treo 650,It is not working with Treo 650. I compared the metal teeth at the connection end. My original palm version has 5 teeth. But this one only has 4 teeth. It can only charge the unit but not able to synchronize.
3,Hot Sync Cable for Palm Models,A good quality cable for the price you would expect an item like this to cost. The item loses some points for not having a hot sync button on the plug like the Palm version does. You can activate the hot sync via the palm applications screen.
1,It does not fit,"I ordered the cable to use w/ my T/X. It has a different configuration for the connection thus, I cannot use it!"
4,Price is right,"It's an OK cable - it took a few times of wiggling to get it to connect cleanly, but seems to have ""broken in"" so it's fine now. Only negative is that it doesn't have a sync button, but that's no real problem."
1,not same as picture,the product is alot different then the picture and it did not charge my palmone e2. i would not recomend it to any one.
1,Confused Seller,I did NOT receive the item pictured. And from the other reviews that I'm reading different people got different cables! I ordered this so that I could charge my Palm Centro and it has NO charging port like pictured. I'm waiting for a reply from the seller.
1,Palm OEM Hotsync cable,"Unfortunately, it broke after second use. It did not fit properly. But it was only $0.38 but the inconvenience and mailing cost was not worth it.Yong"
1,Overpriced & undervalue,This was a waste of $20! A more realistic price for this book/pamphlet would be $2.95. Only good thing I can say about this pamphlet was that it had large type and was easy on my aging eyes.
4,Very short book.,The book was very short and to the point so the message was loud and clear. I would have liked it a tad better with a bit more detail.
3,Good Holocaust book,I liked this book because it has good detals.It ezplains what people had to go through during the Holocaust.I recomed this book because it is a good way to learn about the Holocaust.The strong point was when the war was over.The weak point was when the naizs killed alot of people.
2,Mis-leading binder,"I bought this because it looked like a very old bible but pics very mis-leading..... the is no cross or imageson the binder at all...it is two tone brown and thats it...I dont like to look at pics that are not correct,its like being lie too...THIS IS NOT A VINTAGE BOOKBOOK CASE AT MOST ITS PLAIN JANE..."
5,I love this copy,"This one is probably the best copy of competitive advantage, even though i find many articles in ""on Competition"" as well, but you can still buy both. Acutally you have to!"
5,Mr.,I understand what companies have to do about the creation and sostenibility of competitive advantege by this book.
4,"Its a book, what else do you want?","Just as the description states. Only ordered this for school. Not like I had this huge desire to buy the book for reading material... But, with that said, very informative and great price."
1,Cannot see the Value in it,Any student of economics will not be surprised by this disappointing book. Economic theory says that given a change in price amount demanded can 1. increase 2. decrease 3. stay the same.
3,Interesting concepts but a slow read,"I have become a Michael Porter convert and find his thinking motivating. My only complaint is his writing style. It seems he uses a thousand words to say what could have been said pretty clearly in about one hundred. As a result, I find myself reading it in stages otherwise my head begins to hurt.That said, I have enjoyed the book just wish it was less mind numbing..."
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF $$,"I read the wonderful reviews of this item and bought it. BIG MISTAKE. I have to hit the ""reset"" button every time I want to use it because it won't come on with the normal ""on"" button. In resetting, I have to redo the date and time EVERY time. I JUST GOT THIS THING YESTERDAY!!! I'm sending it back! Also, this is WAY too remedial. I didn't expect a Palm Pilot, but at least something for the thinking adult!"
1,"Negative, hostile songs","While a few of the chants have catchy melodies, listening to children chanting, ""I don't like him,"" ""My socks don't match,"" and ""I'm mad at you"" gets old fast. I would prefer something much more positive sounding."
5,BOOK LOVER'S MUST,"I have discovered a book-one book-which will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about anything you'd like to know about, all in some 500 pages. It is encyclopedic in scope and written in a scholarly, but easy to read style. Look in the index, pick your subject, from the prehistoric to the computer to DNA and cell theory. It's a book lover's must."
5,Love those Little Einsteins!,"Great videos on this dvd, my 3-year old loves it and I don't mind watching it with him over and over and over."
5,mission Celebration,"Classic Little Einstein's. My daughter loves it and I love the educational aspect of the music and art, the team work, etc..."
3,my grandma says they're cute,my crazy hates the little einsteins noe but i can not remember my crazy liked them when he was three + i haven't watxched them in a while with crazy evenThanksJennifer
1,Incomplete,This book in Kindle format is not complete. I could not figure out how or why it had been edited
3,"Something old, something new...","I disagree with the previous reviewer about this video having no interest or value - I enjoyed the two James Marshall presentations very much; they are certainly on par with other Scholastic Video releases, with good music, good animation and faithful representations of the original Grimm stories. I also showed ""The Elves and the Shoemaker"" to a class of Kindergarten-age students yesterday, and they were entertained, and said that they all liked the story, even though the animation is only intermittent. The final two stories on the DVD, ""The Three Billy Goats Gruff"" and ""The Fisherman and his Wife"" are both twenty-to-thirty years older, and have far less entertainment value, and seem a strange match with the other films here, being stylistically and artistically much more primitive. So three good stories, two not-so-good; three out of five stars."
1,Crowded fields,"I wonder how these 317 elaborate pages sprang from nothingness. Chatter, meaning, chatter, no meaning, shatter chatter. Silence? No need to shatter chatter."
2,Less than expected,"I was excited as was the staff in my office. We do so much hole punching that we thought an electric hole punch would releive us of constant manual labor. I figured for the price we would have no problems. But I was amazed to find out that it can't punch through papers if they have staples. Almost all of the papers we file have staples so the machine is pretty much usseless to us. Also, it doesn't even come close to puching what it states is the max number of papers. Plan on half. Also. Paper chips don't all make it in the recepticle. If you pick it up you'll have little bits of paper everywhere. It was disappointing to say the least. Back to the manual hole punch."
4,"Sturdy, comfortable","I sit in this chair 8-10 hours a day five days a week, and it's great. It's highly adjustable and ergonomic, which is important to me as I have a bad shoulder and wrist. I also love the mesh back, since my south-facing office can get hot at times. I've been using the chair for 10 months and it shows no signs of wear.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lumbar support, which slips down and out of position. If it stayed in place, this would easily be a 5-star chair."
3,Not that great,"I'm not sure why so many people love this DMM so much in the reviews. It's a pretty mediocre product, probably worth the $19.99 I paid but definitely not more. The probes are really hard to remove from the slot, the case feels light and kind of flimsy, and the flip cover is just annoying. I got this to save space in my toolbox, but I'm really not impressed. I'm thinking about returning it."
4,It works well but fdlimsey lid,"The meter works well. It does everything as advertised. I found two problems. The lid is flimsy. It tends to flop around but at least it has two real hinges rather than a plastic strip of a hinge. The cutout insuring the meter is turned off before you can close the lid in a nice feature. The second problem is getting the probes and the wire leads back into the provided pocket. I have yet to get them is so that I can properly close the lid. The old ten lbs of wire in the 5 lb pocket applies. As I keep it in a drawer rather than carrying it around in a shirt pocket, it works well for me. If I had to package it up and close it to put in a pocket I would not be happy with it."
3,Quiet chaos..,"I like this one. It manages to have that distinct taint of LPD on the music, and at the same time sound like nothing they've ever done before. The attitude of the whole thing was kind of slow and hypnotizing. I enjoyed it very much."
2,Way too Sweet Protein drink,Unfortunately had to return this. Something in it made me rapidly sick after I tried it for the first time. It has a nice aroma but was way way to sweet for my preferences. Amazon kindly refunded my money even though it was open. Yea for a great retailer.
4,Excellent Quality!,"Although it was recorded in 2005, this is an excellent quality live concert DVD, showing off the great musicianship and creative flow of Porcupine Tree.If you've never heard this band before, do yourself a favour!"
5,Best rock dvd in a lonf time.,Great production. Great songs. Great band.This dvd is worth every penny.
5,What the heck is a Porcupine Tree?,"Well the answer to that question can be found here! Someone shared this with me and now I share it with all. It is the summation of their excellence in musical manifestation. I haven't seen such concentration to expression since attending Yes shows. This DVD is produced with the intent of you receiving the highest quality musical experience. Buy it and you will share it, I promise."
5,PT nails it!,"If you're a fan, it's a great set. If you're not, it's a great introduction to them. It's a relatively small venue, and the staging is nothing dramatic (which shouldn't surprise any fan), but the performance and audio quality are amazing. They are, without a doubt, one of the best groups of musicians/writers/producers around today."
5,WOW,"I know this may sound stupid but I have been waiting my whole life for an album that I just love every song on. If you have a decent home theater, the audio will knock you out of your seat. The video is poorly done almost annoying but I got over that quickly."
4,Warning - No paper Tray,"This is a great printer, but the lack of a papertray severly hampers productivity. You can open the manual feed door and stack paper there, but it hangs out and over time bends the paper etc. The paper tray is a 150 dollar option. If you want to buy this printer with the papertray already bundled, buy the 2550N."
1,Smart Chip Screws the consumer,"Chips inside the toner cartridges force you to throw away consumables before their time.It's frustrating to send a toner cartridge you can feel still has 1/3 to 1/2 its toner back to HP, but that's what they expect you to do. It's also expensive. Our per page cost sky rocketed to 6.5 cents, NOT counting the paper..."
1,"A small thing, but not very good...","Being an avid fan of O Yuki Conjugate (whose members contributed to this effort) and already owning Vol. 2 of ASMG's ""Slim Westerns,"" I ordered this disc blindly, thinking that it would be along the same lines of its predecessors. What a mistake! While at times this collection recalls David Byrne & Brian Eno's ""My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts"" (especially the cuts that feature rants from fundamentalist Christian preachers), the hellfire-and-damnation preaching grates on one's nerves -- and the preaching is plentiful! Ugh. I can't imagine why anyone would want to repeatedly subject themselves to such negativity, but apparently the blokes in Small, Good Thing found it worth preserving here. The music would fare better on its own as instrumentals, fitting somewhere in the genre of trance/lounge. I'll be sure to pre-audition any future discs from this group before slapping down my bucks on the table. I suggest you do the same."
4,A bit expensive,"I hadn't really thought about it but when I went by the store, I realize just how much money I spent getting it through amazon. At the local grocery, I could get a 20 pound of the same stuff for 10.29 and ended up paying 16.48 for a 14 pound online. The product itself is quite amazing. I have pretty picky cats that have pretty smelly fecal matter and this covers it well."
2,Its not the best but its ok,I did us this product and it did its job but it wasn't the best product. I found something that was much much better.
4,You want to work on the railroad?,"At the very least, this book serves as a warning to those who take the job lightly. As a thriller, put away your disbelief as to one man's ability to do all our hero does, because this stuff has or could happen. My dad pulled the pin with a man in the knuckle. You don't want to go there. With the ability of digital FX to keep the carnage at a minimum, this would make a good movie. Bruce, where are you ?"
5,An exciting book for anyone,"Kem Parton has written a winner! His style is captivating, and the story line and subject matter are timely and believable. Mr. Parton's book gets ""two thumbs up"" from me and I am not a railroad afficianado. If you want to read an exciting book I encourage you to fork out a couple of bucks for this and prepare to get entertained."
5,Great Read!,End of the Line was obviously written by someone who truly knows railroading. It is very exciting and totally accurate. It is worth the time to read. I have been a railroader for over 30 years and a locomotive engineer and a full time railroad elected union officer so I know what I am talking about.
1,Hilarious!!!,This may be the funniest book I've ever read. A railroader named Casey Jones? Terrorists attacking through the rail system? An author who lost his job because he published this book through a vanity press? A series of reviews all clearly written by the same person? The book reminded me of the Ali G episode in which Ali G asks the head of the INS whether Homeland Security is afraid that terrorists will drive a bomb-laden train into the White House. A more plausible scenario than those propounded by this piece of literature
3,Boring but educational for the novice,"This video is not for anyone that already knows how to give a good massage. It's for anyone interested in massage but not willing to spend hundreds if not thousands on classes. There's nothing erotic about this dvd. It was educational in the art of relaxing touch. You will learn how to give a good swedish massage but it doesn't show much about genital massage or anal massage. It's 50 minutes of tantic/swedish massage and 10 minutes of genital massage (5 for females, and 5 minutes for males) Although I must say the video was professionally done. This lighting was good and the massage therapists knew what they were doing. I just wanted more techniques on the genital area."
2,Not what I expected,This book was purchased to be read alongside another book my Bible study group is doing.IMHO Marshall spends too much time taking issue with other writer's interpretations (that he considers wrong). For my purposes it was a waste of money.
4,THE HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS TUTOR 2nd ed.,The book has been great in helping my students better understand concepts associated with high school physics. The examples are numerous and the calculations are clearly shown. This is a great addition for a high school reference library.
4,nice for gift,good for gifts! nice get up but dnt expect uch in terms of longevity!nice heavy watch with big stylish dial for 2 yr use..i bought 4 of them for my relatives at the same time.they all liked it(the look and the get up) and its 2 month now-no complaints yet.
3,Decent book but not great,"I wanted to like Felicity more than I did; I felt that her reasons for acting the way she did were never made convincing enough. At least she eventually recognized her bad behavior for what it was. Thorn was terrific; rather than the type of guy you like to read about but could never imagine living with in real life, Thorn was very much the kind of guy you'd love to settle down with.The chase ploy did drag on too long, as did the lead couple's back-and-forth romance, all of which slowed the pace of the story. Nevertheless, it was a good read and, if you like comparatively mild stories, worth a few hours of one's time."
2,WHERE IS THE CARAVAN?,"I wanted this dvd because I love the desert and camels. Sadly the dvd was about waiting for the arrival of a Caravan travelling through the desert to get to the village waiting for the food and essentials. I did not want a history of how a well could be constructed, and how the villagers live. It was for me just another documentary of how a poor village survives. It could have contained so much more and been much more interesting. Shame!"
2,Not Very Realistic,"My little sister got this book out of the library, and I skimmed over it. It is very sad and it is unrealistic, because Ms. Wiggins' pony, Winston, gets sick and dies, and he lies down for a long time while he's dying.I read in an animal magazine once that horses' ribs get squished underneath them if they lie down for awhile; which is why they sleep standing up. This book is not really very realistic, yet my sister read it and liked it.The Saddle Club are much better books and you should try those instead of these. They are much more realistic.The Pony Pals books are sometimes interesting, but I think that they are a little immature and the Pony Pals themselves are supposed to be 10 years old. They act around seven. If you are around seven, then you might like this series, but if you are older than that, try the Saddle Club."
5,Good but sad.,This book deals with losing someone you love. Anna has a very hard time and Pam and Lulu have to help her deal with it. Very good.
3,looks nice,Sharp looking accessory. Says will fit a 1lb block of butter. lid not quite big enough though.
3,"Cliched, but you can't help loving it.","I have to admit I love this book, even tho it's got some pretty clunky cliches in it (a hold-over from Wallace's career as a screenwriter and romance writer). And she strains credibility a bit by trying to cram in every single Baby Boomer issue: women's lib, assassinations, rape, pre-marital sex, birth control, abortion, the draft, Vietnam vet syndrome, Amerasian kids, workplace sexism, AIDS, etc. etc. But if you can get past sentences like ""Her green eyes glittered like a cat about to pounce upon its prey"" and ""She was transported to a feeling she'd never felt before,"" Wallace does manage to draw you totally into the lives of these 4 women and make you keep turning the pages to find out how everything turns out. You especially identify if you're from that era, but even non-Baby Boomers can get caught up in it. There's a reason writing like this sells - we all secretly love a good soap opera. Cliches or not, it works - and keeps us coming back for more."
4,CHARLIE,"""CHARLIE"" as he is so affectionately called, just keeps getting better and better as the books go on. I've read through the first three and have just ordered the next three. I'm intent on reading the entire series. John Harvey has created a most interesting man."
3,The handle broke after a couple of years,"This was one of my first WUSTHOF knives. My son is a chef and he recommended them. At the time I purchased this knife, I didn't know that different quality levels are offered by the brand. I liked this knife because it was sharp and felt good in the hand. My three star rating is because the handle broke after a couple of years. I have since upgraded my WUSTHOF knife purchases to the higher quality ones GRAND PRIX II."
1,Surprisingly Poor Quality,The handle cracked within the first two weeks. The blade is flimsy and already dull. What a disappointment.
4,Seems well built - but don't expect a warranty,"As the previous reviewer noted, it only comes with about 10 nails. A box of 2500 was about $30 at the local big box store. The nailer seems well built, and fires 3"" nails into soft wood with the heads buried about 1/4"". The instruction book was translated from a foreign language, so don't expect to discover the features without a lot of experimentation. I still haven't figgured out how the ""Depth-of-Drive Adjustment"" in the ad works (unless you count adjusting the air pressure down until the nail is left protruding and finishing it with a smack of a framing hammer). There is also no mention of a warranty. Shipping seemed to take an unusually long time, so if you are in a hurry, pay the extra $40 for a Grizzly."
5,Tenchi Universe - The Complete Boxed Set (Vols. 1-8) DVD,I thought this series was just so wonderful. It has everything you need for a great show action/humor/romance. Though the ending was more dramatic it was very well done. I love this series it is one of my favorites. This is one set I will watch over and over. My favorite episode I have to say is either one of the Time and Space and Adventures or No Need for a Conclusion. The animation is great and the characters are wonderful. If you want to watch an action packed romance-comedy get this series!
1,OAV is better...,"I really don't like the TV series of Tenchi Universe, Tenchi In Tokyo, and the movies. It's funny, but the storylines are different, and adding Kiyone as a main character is not really smart. I give the TV series a 1 star.So instead, I stick with the OAV series like Tenchi Muyo (OAV), Mihoshi Special/Pretty Sammy (the one when Kiyone is lost in space, swears to kill Mihoshi), No Need For Tenchi/All-New Tenchi Muyo books, Tenchi Muyo GXP, and in the future...Tenchi Muyo OAV3! Didn't you know that some characters from GXP will appear in the OAV3? Plus Tenchi's mom will appear in OAV3...and her name isn't Achika Masaki, it's Kiyone Masaki. So yeah, stick with the OAV series. It's funnier."
5,A true visual feast,Rarely have I seen a photography book that captures people and places with such power and consistency. Every image forces you to stop and explore. There is real emotion in the portraits and the landscapes place you right there. The caliber of work and the quality of print make this one of the most rewarding books I've ever owned.
5,Stripping away the stereotypes.,"Well beyond the typical books of this genre. Mr Robbins not only tells a story, he does it with an insight into the hardships and the religous intensities of this culture I have never felt before. This book changed me. My ultimate compliment to an author.Buy this if you want to see beyond yourself, into another world of human existance."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Built poorly, the ball arrived with no pump instructions and a DVD that doesn't work in Macs. Having gone to the manuf website, I followed the instructions for the ball. 45 minutes later, it was fully pumped up. Then I inserted the stopper only to find that the seal was Awful. Leaked air almost immediately. There is little more frustrating than spending an hour of your time pumping a ball, then having to rebox it up, then print a return form, and finally drive to the post office to send the ball back - for a $25 fitness ball!!!Junk - avoid purchasing at all costs. Get the higher end model for an extra $15 - TRUST ME."
4,GoFit Stability Ball Review,"The GoFit Stability Ball is a great way to tone your abs and stretch the back muscles. The DVD included with the ball gives short exercises you can do with the ball. The one draw back with the DVD is the exercises are shown seperately and you need to play each one. I guess the exercises are simple enough though once you learn them you probably won't need the DVD. The 65 cm ball is able to accomodate a person from 5'5"" to 6' 2"". Yoga is a good way to strenghten your core muscles as you try to balance the ball and position yourself in various poses and exercises. Worth the money but was recently at Walmart, and you can find a Stability ball there for half the price."
4,"Good ball, bad DVD","Happy with the ball, but the woman in the DVD has probably never made a workout demo before. She couldn't even do some of the exercises. If you can get a ball separately, do it. Then get a better demo DVD, say Adam Ford's Swiss Ball Basics."
5,Love it!,"This ball is perfect for an at home workout. The video shows you so many ways to use it so if you are not able to go to the gym this ball covers it. The pump is a little cheap, but that's the only complaint I have."
1,Inaccurate Description,The ball is not as described. I could not use it. It was also difficult to inflate.
2,ball sizes run larger than advertised,"I regularly use stability balls at the gym and bought this one for use at home. I use the 65 cm balls the most, so that is the size I bought from GoFit. However, the ball is clearly larger than 65 cm when fully inflated. I measured the size at 70 cm, and it is still a little more squishable than a workout ball should be. Sure, I could let some air out of the ball so that it is smaller, but then it would be flat! The GoFit ball is a poor quality product if that is what was intended.While I have not had any problems wih my ball leeking, I would suggest buying a size smaller than you use at the gym or buying a different company's ball."
4,I love this ball--wish I didn't have to buy it again!!,"I purchased this 65-inch purple ball well over a year ago and it improved my posture (I use it while on my computer at home) and replaced traditional chairs for me. I actually cried the day it burst (and it did burst and left me with a bruised head!), but I think it came in contact with a broken glass (we had our windows repaned) so I do not blame the ball for that.I could not wait to replace it and ordered one I thought was the same, but it was not---though it claimed to be 65cm, I felt like my knees hit my chin each time I used it. The reason the GoFit ball is my favorite (and I am reordering it) is the strength of the ball--it holds more weight and holds it better.I took off one star for the 'bursting' experience--the ball was there one second, and gone the next. That could be devestating for a pregnant woman."
4,Nice for the price.,The size fits me and my wife well. We love it. The material looks sturdy. The only issue I had was like someone mentioned the air seems to be leaking pretty quick. having said that I havent filled air since past 5 days..But I would have prefered it to stay firm at least 1 week.
2,A very average product,This is just an average product. Not a high standard one where you feel satisfied with your purchase I was hoping for better quality. The air escape and the pump is very cheaply made.
5,Great for workouts,Reasonably priced. Fun to use.A little hard to inflate with the foot pump.Once it's inflated thou it's great.
5,I use this book frequently!,"When I get ready to bake something, I generally consult this book first. It is organized well and provides all the basic techniques (as well as some advanced ones), that I need for probably 75 percent of the baking projects I do. Even if I don't use Nick's recipes I use the techniques that are in the book. The techniques are explained well, with good pictures to support the text (or vice versa). I also can make my own creations built on the building blocks in this book. I even take the ideas, recipes, or flavor combinations from other sources and modify them so they use Nick's techniques or proportions or components.98 percent of everything I've tried from this book has worked and tasted good (usually very good or excellent). This is a cookbook classic."
4,BATASTIC,Special bronze coloring makes it a collectable item by itself. Highly recommended to all who is in the toy collectable hobby. One of a kind item that is hard to find in any regular toy and collectable shop..........................
4,Very informative,"This video, made by ABC in the ""World of Discovery"" series, is a very educational, although sometimes depressing documentary of the magnificent rhino. Somewhat similar in content and structure to National Geographic's 1987 video, ""The Rhino Wars"", it focuses less on the poaching."
5,A must read for triathletes - Open Water Swimming,"Whether you compete in open water swimming or in an olympic pool, this video is very helpful. There's plenty of great tips. Visual aides helps the text one reads in triathlete training books. This video is a very useful compliment to any triathlete or competitive athlete book. One year a triathlon may be in a pool and you may be surprised to learn the next year the event has been moved to open water swimming. You need this video."
4,Great Guide,We started a women's Bible study several months ago and have tried a variety of books to guide our group. This book has been the best by far. The themes of each chapter are easy to follow and generate good conversation.
2,Alittle displeased,I was little displeased due to the fact the book had alot of personal thoughts in it. Lots of writing. Who would sell a book with tht much writing in it? Didnt leave room for even my notes. Also wasnt mentioned in description.
3,2nd book in the series & it was good...,"Description from the back of the book:The Lone Star StateIt was as forthright and independent as the women who braved the rugged land, and sunset-haired Kate Calloway was as feisty an example of the breed as Cord had ever seen. A Texas woman. He had not dealt with one in a long time, but he recognized the gumption in her blue eyes.He would be a fool to question the threat behind the shotgun she leveled at his chest. He would be still more a fool to give in to the urge to take her soft body right there on the hard, dusty ground. For though he sensed that they were two halves of one whole, Kate belonged to the man he'd come to destroy. That they would meet again was certain; the only question was how long he could wait before making her his.* I wouldn't say this book was great but it was certainly good. Not as good as the first but I'm hoping for much more in the last book of this series. So far I would recommend this series."
2,Heroine had more gumption than smarts,"Kate, the heroine of ""Texas Empires: Lone Star,"" had gumption. But that didn't stop her from making stupid mistakes throughout the story. I suppose she was supposed to be so attracted to the hero, Cord, that her common sense went out the window.If you like that sort of story, you'll enjoy this book -- the plot and setting *are* good. But be warned that this book contains unneeded subplots; plenty of distrust; a Big Secret; and an over-the-top villain.I gave this book a D+ at All About Romance."
5,Perfect Bag,"I needed something to lug my saddle back and forth from my house to the barn and this is perfect. Great price and very durable. I'm pretty hard on it, carrying it back and forth a couple times a week."
2,Beware!,"This item was shipped without any product packaging (loose in the shipping carton with no protection) by the Amazon associate; with nothing to indicate its value as a collectible. Make sure you REALLY want to spend $50 for a 6 1/2"" stuffed Peter Rabbit...this was to be a special birthday gift for a little girl. Amazon provided a full refund and return."
4,Merriam- Webster Rhyming Dictionary,The book is organized by rhyming syllables rather than rhyming words and so provides a wider range of rhymes and near rhymes than most books of this kind.
1,Kindle edition is not functional,"The search function in the Kindle edition simply does not work. You type in a word, you get a list that seems to have no relationship to the word typed and does not include that word."
1,Odd-Man-Out,I guess I have to be the odd-man-out because I certainly don't think this book deserves a five-star-review. Most of the rhyming words are so obscure you will be hard-pressed to work them into a sentence. I found The New Comprehensive American Rhyming Dictionary to be much more useful. But I guess three five-star-reviews can't be wrong.
1,Monstrosity,"If you are interested in becoming insane, I suggest you purchase this product. Not only are you giving them your hard earned dollars, but they torment you in return. Most of the time, these broom machines are totally useless, but this one goes the extra mile. Not only does it miss 99% of the dirt, but it blows the 1% that was miraculously picked up back in your face and on the floor."
1,"I need a vacuum, not a fan","Now that I've actually received and used this product, I'm extremely surprised it's as highly rated as it is. While it does seem to pick up a fair amount of dust and dog hair, for the most part it blows more of it all over the apartment through the extremely strong exhausting action. It goes everywhere, and it's impossible to get the floor and rugs clean. As soon as I cover a spot, it gets dust and hair blown right back over it.I'm returning this immediately - I don't know if the one I got is defective or if it's just a terrible product."
2,"barely worked, broke too soon","We bought this as a cheap replacement for another Dirt Devil we'd had for more than a year. This one broke repeatedly, and even when it looked like it was working, never had suction. We were happy to pitch it."
4,Great product,"Can't beat this for the money. It's not the most rugged but, on the flip side, it's light and effortless to push. It is an upright that also functions as a canister. It has all the power of vacuums that are 5 times as expensive. Get this..."
2,Burns through belts,"Yes it has good suction. Yes it is light. Yes it is noisy.But also it burns through belts very quickly, and what's more, it sprayed oily burnt belt through the attachment hose and onto my couch."
3,"Good, solid vacuum","I had this vacuum (or a previous but similar version of this model) since Jan 2006. Tonight, it died. The motor started to intermittently lose power and burn. In fact, when I turned it over to see if the brush was turning I witnessed a few sparks fly out! Anyway, notwithstanding its dramatic demise, this vacuum actually did an excellent job for the past 3.5 years. The only thing I didn't like was emptying it- bagless isn't great b/c you have to empty it outside, lest dust flies everywhere in your house. Also, the filters are about $20 and if you have pets, you're gonna need to change the filter somewhat regularly. Don't be fooled by the budget price of the vacuum, they get you on the filters! (Kinda like ink jet printers/printer cartridges) I'm now looking for a replacement, and will probably go with a vacuum that uses a bag."
1,Vacuums like a leaf blower,"Others have commented on the fact that it blows air out the front. For me, this was a major con. Everything I need to pickup gets blow away as I move the vacuum towards it. If this vacuum sent the air out from the side, I would highly recommend it, but for me having it blow out the front was unacceptable and I returned it."
3,Pretty good for price,"I do like this vacuum. It is a great price, but it does have a few drawbacks that are important to note. It is quite loud, and it blows away some of the dust/things you're trying to vacuum. For instance, when I assembled it (which was simple.. except I think one screw they sent me was the wrong size, so I had to use one that I had, because the others were too shotrt), I tried to vacuum up some of the styrophom blew away). Also the flap that the hose goes into, when the hose isn't in it, it sometimes blows open letting dirt out (maybe tape it?). And it doesn't move the best, kind of clunky. Otherwise it's good for the price, the hose is pretty good, the cord is long enough, it's on the lighter weight side. Overall, I'd say its a good purchase for an apartment."
2,Powerful suction but ultra cheap materals,"This vacuum cleaner really gets the dirt out of the carpet well but that's about it. The plastic parts are most definitely made in China, Cheap, it even smells cheap! It actually feels like a cheap child's toy while using it. It is not as loud to me as others were stating in my opinion. The worst part of the entire product is the ""hurricane"" force winds that blows in front of the unit. It blows dirt, dust, even a sock across the floor well before the suction hits; it actually caused one of the pictures on my wall to move around! If I bought this at a local store I would return it but too much hassle to mail it back. When it burns out (which is probably soon), I will remove the motor and cord & let my niece use it as a toy."
2,has issues with beater brush,had this Dirt Devil Breeze Bagless Upright Vacuum for only 3 months and the beater brush broke. The bushings went out.
1,Not as advertised at all,"I purchased this vacuum and the cord is 15 feet long, not 25 as stated. There is nothing automatic about the height adjustment. If does not adjust automatically nor can it be adjusted manually for different carpet types. If you want a vacuum for a small kitchen with very short pile carpet, it works okay but that is the limit. Find a better brand."
4,pretty good,"Spent some time figuring out how it worked...It's really powerful, though a little noisy. The only problem is that the hose is loose and easily self-detached."
3,Dirt Devil Breeze Bagless,this vacuum is quite loud. the filter also gets pluggged and it is dirty cleaning it. I recommend cleaning the filter outdoors to avoid the mess.
4,Not bad for the price.,"This is a cheap vacuum. That said, it was a pretty good vacuum. It did a great job of picking up dirt and pet hair in my small apartment. The filters were available in most stores around here, so that was also nice. It's a lightweight but sturdy vacuum.However, it's not the best vacuum out there. We recently went back to Rainbow and had no need for our Dirt Devil anymore. We donated it to a family in need. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a decent vacuum without wanting to shell out big bucks for a Dyson or something."
4,Great vacuum for the price!,"Being a single guy, I'm definitely not ""Susie Homemaker"". I wanted something inexpensive that would get the job done. Lots of suction and does a great job,especially with cat fur in the area rugs. My only complaint, as seen in other reviews, is that the hose is too short for using the tool attachments----------"
4,Pretty Good,"This vac gets the job done, now i havent owned it for very long about 2 months but it seems to be holding up just fine and it was inexpensive so im quite satisfied. I was tricked into thinking that it didnt come with a filter so i ordered 1...it came with a filter so i have 2 which isnt the worst thing in the world but im just saying they couldve said a filter was included.."
1,"cheap, low quality","We bought this vacuum for our basement. Based on the low price I didn't expect much. But even my low expectations weren't met. I did not like that the product needs assembly. The quality is so bad that while the motor may be powerful, most of the suction is lost, such that actual performance is really bad. Sound is terrible and way too loud. Would not recommend. Better spend a little more."
2,bad design,"When you use the vacuum with the handle back the exhaust blows out the front and blows what ever you'r trying to vacuum up ahead of the vacuum and you can never catch up with it.It blows so much dirt around it makes a bigger mess. The vacuum cleaner work's great as a canister,but only as a canister."
3,Dirt Devil,"This is the first upright vacuum cleaner that I have owned. For the price the machine performs well on carpet. However, it is exceptionally loud and I will reconsider purchasing a bagless vacuum again. Emptying the canister is a nasty chore."
5,Strong Value,"I am not a big cleaner so I didn't know what I wanted from a vacuum. I just wanted something stronger than the one I had. So after going shopping locally and seeing decent vacuums were over $100, I came to find this one here. I must it SUCKS!! In a good way of course. It is light and compact yet strong and effective at the same time. I would definitely recommend this to a bachelor.... in fact, 2 of my friends have purchased this after using mine."
4,Angel in Devil's clothes,"Have to use it to see how dirty your carpet floor is. Cleans fabulously. Assembles in 10 minutes with only 4 screws to fasten. If you are looking for a cheap solution for your dusty worries, this is highly recommended."
2,Have to turn it off to use tools,"This vacuum is functional, but with total hassle. You have to turn it off and attach the tools to use the tools. It's heavy to me. The vent in the front blows air out really hard and makes it hard to pickup light objects. Plus side is it does pretty good on bare floor. I won't use the tools, it's a total pain to use them."
3,Dirt Devil Review,"This is a well-priced, light-weight vacuum cleaner. I like that it auto adjusts from floor to carpet; the cord is 25ft, although I prefer 30ft which is hard to find, and the canister is easy to empty and clean. I don't like having to completely stop and assemble the hose w/attachments. I would not buy another one."
2,Dirt Devil Vacuum,This item was inexpensive as vacuums go but it still was not worth the money. Incredibly poor suction. Have to go over carpets multiple times and still it isn't clean. Would only recommend for extremely light duty with just dust. Will be donating this and buying a quality machine. A waste of money in my opinion.
1,Worst vacuum I've ever owned,"I have owned a dirt devil vacuum before and found it quite satisfactory for the price. Not so this one. There are four complaints:1. It is difficult and unpleasant to change from the floor to the hose. You have to physically shift the suction tube from the one to the other--no simple switch as with most vacuums. This means you avoid doing it as much as possible.2. It exhausts out the front and blows the dust bunnies away. You literally have to try to sneak up on them and chase them down. They often get blown up in the air, and then you either have to wait for everything to settle, or come back later to find the room looking still un-vacuumed.3. It is heck-of noisy.4. The filter is difficult to clean."
5,Great buy,"Bought this vacuum at Home Depot today for $39 and it does a fantastic job. Recently bought a Shark Infinity, paid $200 for it, worst unit I have ever used or bought. Highly recommend the Dirt Devil and the price can't be beat! Even bought a 1 yr extra warranty for $4.99."
1,Defective,"This vacuum worked great at first. After a short time there was an occasional whiff of burning belt and a whine like the brushroll/ beater bar wasn't turning. Soon the belt broke, so I went to replace it and found the beater bar had completely seized up. Looking the brushroll/ beater bar over, I saw that it had been assembled crookedly. One of the square holder ends was centered in the middle of the bar, the other end was offset. This is obvious when looking at it and should have never made it past QC in my opinion. A replacement one will cost $16 plus shipping- not worth it for a $50 vacuum."
4,Loud but it works!,"I clean houses for a living, so I've used a lot of different vacuums. I say, for the money, this is a great vacuum. It has great suction power, which ends up being the bottom line. If I had hundreds of dollars to spend, yes, I suppose I would get a Miele but for a $50 workhorse, put your money on the Dirt Devil.Pros:-It's light - I can carry it easily with one hand-It has great suction power - I never worry that it will do the job-long lasting/Stands up under daily residential cleans-it's affordableCons:-It's so loud that I wear earplugs when I use it (but I am paranoid about hearing loss)-Fan does blow light feathers/dust bunnies around at certain angles.Yes, it's a joy to use a client's Miele when available, but if that's out of your budget and you want something that you can depend on to keep sucking the dirt up, clean after clean, consider a dirt devil."
2,Great for laminate-poor for carpet- creates a windstorm,The unit has great suction power but the exhaust from motor is extremely fast. Would blow everything off the refrigerator.The unit has a statement on the front that it automatically adjusts to different heights. NOT SO. there is no auto OR manual adjustment. It will pull area carpets off the floor no matter how you use it. Works great on laminate floors if you don't mind the hurricane exhaust but is hard to push on carpet as always on the lowest floor setting.
4,A Real Decent Vacuum,This Vacuum works good. It Arrived on time and Its Light Weight and is easy to Dump out the stuff.(Bag less) makes it easier.It Picks up good and also has some what of a Longer cord then other vacuums.The Downside:It is Kinda Loud and blows massive air out the front when its on.Other then that it is A Real Decent Vacuum.
5,Love it!!!,"Love this vacuum, light and easy to handle....yes it makes noise which vacuum doesn't...I Do recommend, I was able to put it together my self and when it comes to this stuff not good at it, when my husband came home was shocked when he saw it was all together....and working. Great vacuum Thanks."
4,Not a fancy vacuum,"We have a dyson for our house. When it arrived it took less than 2 minutes to put it together. It was light and super easy. This dirt devil we got for our RV and it required several screws and we had to use the directions to put it together properly. This vacuum works very well for the environment we use it in. I bet a studio or small 1 bedroom apartment would be good with this as well. It's easy to use once put together, and the litter bin was easy to empty."
4,Great Vacuum,"I'm very happy with this vacuum. It is very light weight but yet has great suction. I like that it automatically adjusts to the floor height -- go from bare floors to carpet easily. The only disadvantage over my last Dirt Devil is that the hose is not connected. If you want to use the hose, you have to connect it. Not a big deal but nicer if it was always connected."
5,Perfect cleaning the carpet floor and also tiles,Perfect cleaning the carpet floor and also tiles. Cleaning everything quickly and also I spending less time to clean when compare to old which I used.
2,Pain in the butt to install,"Has a lot of parts you have to install, clunky product that is difficult to maintain without it falling apart. If I hadn't damaged the box it came in, I would have probably returned it."
2,Burnt after two and half month of service,I love to have this. It is good for money and worth to buy it.I will recommend to buy this product.Above review I put first but it got burnt at 3rd month so have to write again to suggest that buy at your own risk.
1,Not worth the $,My home has been through two of theses already. The first one we went to buy it together. I figured I did not need an expensive one because I only have 3 small rooms of carpet. No need to go crazy with expensive ones. It did not last a year. We went through two belts and those are no big deal change but the minute you open up the machine you take out the roller it seems like it doesn't sit right after it. I called up Dirt devil and they could do nothing for me since the warranty was up. The price they wanted me to pay to fix it I could of bought another machine. Which we did. I thought that maybe I did not install the belts right when changing them on the first one so I bit the bullet to buy the more improved version of the vacuum I had.I still have the second one here it has been almost a year and no problems with the belts but it doesn't seem to pick up anything. I guess the life of this vacuum is only a year . Don't waste your money on this vacuum.
3,Mediocre,"We were given this vacuum as an unregistered wedding gift, so I had an open mind when we first got it. I was excited about the bagless characteristic, because previously I had only used bags and was curious as to how I would like the bagless. We've now had it for 2 years and have only used it for our 700 sqft apartment (with mostly carpeting) and our car. All in all, I would not recommend this vacuum. The suction isn't great, and the handling is typically awkward for a large upright, and I can never get the filter clean. I think I'll buy a new one and stretch the life of this vacuum a bit, but as soon as we have some extra cash, I'll be upgrading to something else after doing some research. A vacuum should still be going strong after 2 years in a small apartment without pets. I guess it never was strong to begin with, so that explains it."
2,Breeze,"I didn't believe the reviews about the exhaust blowing things away from the vacuum. LOL I was so wrong. The price is good and tools work better than most, but if I did this over I wold have spent more on a different brand."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"We are in the lodging business and have a lot of experience with vacuums. We have purchased Dirt Devil vacuums in the past and they are all worthless pieces of junk. Cheaply made. No suction. For whatever reason, we recently purchased a Breeze bagless. I think it was on sale or something. Boy, big mistake. The Breeze was the worst of the Dirt Devils yet. On hardwood/laminate flooring, it had no suction. It would blow dirt, crumbs, etc. across the floor. It was also clumsy to use and very cheaply made. We've learned our lesson: No more Dirt Devils! For the under $100 category, Bissell is the best bang for the buck."
2,"Buy only for carpeting, forget hardwood floors!!!","I purchased this vac because I have had Dirt Devil vacs for as long as I can remember. Like others I have had, this is powerful! It works great in the rugs in my home. The problem is on hardwood floors. Here is why...the exhaust vent is right on the front of the vac. It blows everything around so it is difficult and time consuming to clean.Another issue is the hand held tube. You have disconnect the floor tube and then connect the hand held tube. It is not as easy to use as my past Dirt Devils.Spend some more money and buy a better quality Dirt Devil. It will be worth it."
5,Clean,Great unit for the money. My cleaning lady wanted me to upgrade and suggested this one! We love the bag less Much more effective. Tons of suction. Typical lightweight plastic but good for price. Nice unit
4,Great this vacuum..,"I have been searching for a good vacuum and something that wasn't going to be horribly big because I don't have much closet space. This seriously is a great value! They could have packed it in a actual shipping box, but hey nothing was damaged. Also, the hose on the top falls down when vacuuming which doesn't bother me because nothings perfect. When I used it on my center rug A LOT of cat hair was in the container I didn't even know it was that bad. The sucking power is insane. I would definitely recommend this vacuum!"
1,Not pleased,"So this is my first review that I have written because I felt the need to share our disappointing experience. After just 1 year, the vacuum is dead - - smoke, dead motor. I'm sick of buying vacuums. If you are looking for a vacuum to last for a few years, this is NOT the one."
4,Great little Vac,"First of all, DON'T BUY the SUGGESTED FILTER AND BELTS. They are the wrong filter. You would want to get the F2 Filter, not the F1. You would also want to get Belt 15 and not the 12. If you follow that information you will save some time and a lot of hassle.I use the vacuum to clean my pellet stove mostly. It works greats because of the Hepa filter. Other than that because of its size I keep it in our basement. It works on carpet and on hard surfaces too. It is a great cleaning tool to have especially for that price."
5,Vacuum,"I had one of this for years and was using it every day at the store with high foot traffic and it was doing a terrific job at cleaning and never broke, its a little loud but it works great"
5,Dirt Devil Breeze is awesome,"Does what I need it to do, its light, easy to assemble and easy to clean. Best vacuum I have owned so far!"
5,Love it,"This vacuum is light weight, easy to operate and picks up cat and dog fur easily. The canister is easy to take off and on to dispose of the contents."
1,Disappointed.,"As one other reviewer here has already mentioned, the exhaust is located in the front. This has got to be the most idiotic design flaw I have ever experienced. It was blowing the sand from my potted plants and shooting it everywhere. Also curtains and papers on coffee tables were blowing around and quite frankly, it does not do a very good job at picking up debris from the floor.I got it for 50% off at a sale through Carson's. So I only paid $50 for it. But now I see why it is on sale.The packaging was so wretched I had to tear the box off piece by piece to get to actual vacuum cleaner.The assembly instructions were a bit vague which made it a tad frustrating to construct.I am disappointed, to say the least."
1,Terrible vacuum. Died after 3 months of use.,"Bought this vacuum in October 2011 for occasional area rug use. By January 2012 it stopped working. I have to run over the same piece of carpet 20x just to get maybe 30% of the particles picked up. Even worse, the vacuum leaves a trail of dust behind it now. Worst vacuum I've ever owned, sorry I purchased it."
2,"If lightweight is what you want, this is it, but....","This vacuum is super light and it does seem to pick up dirt quite well. Using the hose is a hassle because you must disconnect one hose to connect to the base. It will get old fast. For $50 it is a good buy, but do not expect it to last long. It is very, I mean very cheaply made. Bump it the wrong way and it will break. For $50 more you can get a much better Hoover bagless"
1,Terrible Product,"My wife bought this to replace a 15 year old Hoover. Why she chose this make and model is beyond me. Without a doubt this vaccum is the worst product I've ever owned. We have a dog that sheds a lot so we need to vaccum daily. Unfortunately this vaccum picksup almost nothing and pushes the excess around but doesn't pick it up. In fact it doesn't pick up much of anything. I've gone through the manuel and tried to figure out the problem but it just is useless. Save your self some money and aggrevation and buy something, anything but this vaccum."
1,lost suction,"I bought it 1 year ago, initially worked great and I was very pleased with the results. After 2 months of use it started to loose suction and 6 months later it was a completely useless item. Extremely disappointed."
4,"Great Vacuum, great price...","Purchased this about 3 years ago and it's worked great. The belt finally broke and I needed to replace the original filter canister as well, would've cost about $15 for both... since I lost some of the attachments and the roller bar had a lot of hair and junk that needed cleaning, I decided I might as well and just buy a new one for under $50! Yes it is loud - but hey it's a vacuum! Suction is great and you don't have to buy expensive bags all the time. Overall for the price, can't beat it."
5,good vacuum,"This is a very good vacuum. It picks up almost everything. It is a little noisier than other models, but otherwise is very easy to use and maintain."
4,"So far, so good. My wife lives this thing","We obviously had a bad vacuum cleaner because once my wife received this one, we were amazed at how much dog and cat hair was still in the carpet in the basement. It was almost a bad full! For the price, this thing does a GREAT job!"
1,over heating,if u have bigger than a studio ignore it. very poor perfomance and over heats.worst vaccum cleaner i have ever used
4,Amazing!!,This is one of the best I've had... Amazingly Powerful..!! and worth every penny you spend...!!1 thing I dont like about it is that it sounds like a Tank...but I can ignore that coz it cleans within seconds..:D
3,buy it if your interest is very focused on the model 92,"The book justifiably centers on the current flagship of Beretta products, the model 92 and all it's variations. but for a book focused on ""modern"" beretta firearms it's unfortunate to buy an edition 7 years out of date. This wouldn't be anything to count against the book except that in this instance there has been several interesting new developements. Those somewhat familiar with Beretta firearms should be aware that the Model 8000 series and the model 9000S series as well as the subcompact Tomcat are not featured which might not be overtly stated by it's 1994 publication date. However, the superb coverage of the model 92 including detailed information on proper 9mm cartridges and holsters makes this a good buy if your interest is very focused on the model 92."
2,Figuring out pronunciation of words a pain the butt,"This dictionary sucks. So I know how to use the International Phonetic Alphabet to figure out to pronounce words in other langauges. For example I want to know how to say ""yellow"" in Italian and when I look up ""yellow"" I see the Italian word for ""yellow"": ""giallo"" but it shows how to pronounce the English word, not the Italian word, so I then have to go back and look up ""giallo"" in the Italian section to figure out how to pronounce that. It is a complete waste of time and I can't believe it is made this way."
2,not that good,"it is not that good, confusing and not entirely straight forwardsometimes , I get what I am looking for.would not recommend"
1,Review for Italian Dictionary,I ordered this book weeks ago and still have not received it. I cannot review the product itself because I don't have it.
4,Italian English Dictionary,"It serves my needs well. I work for an Italian attorney and most of his clients/contacts call in from Italy, as well, we send emails and faxes back and forth to his two law practices in Rome and Milan. Webster's New World Dictionary is a great asset in aiding me to perform my job most efficiently."
5,Fabulous and complete,"This is not a travelers dictionary, it is very thick, complete, detailed- more for someone who is learning to speak Italian, rather than the average tourist who wants to know a little. It has Italian to English and English to Italian so it is very versatile. Great dictionary to have on hand for studying the language."
5,What can I say,This and all Webster's dictionaries are great. It is nice that they continue to update information for you so the new words and definitions are always there. Great size and not too heavy to carry around with you.
4,good book,"good book. fast delivery, good condition. but was significantly larger than I had hoped, thinking i would have been able to puut it in my pocket to take with me on travels, but this is more like a full sized dictionary. Was still helpful though and would recommend product and seller."
5,"Itallian Dictionary, Webster's New World",The dictionary was promptly sent and gladly received. It is used nearly daily at my desk. I cannot understand why I didn't get the dictionary sooner. Many thanks to Amazon and to the seller for making it part of my day. Grazie mille.
4,Great addition,I think this book is a great supplement to learning Italian no matter what method you are using to learn it.
5,Very helpful and complete,"I am studying conversational Italian with Pimsleur.Replaced my old less complete dictionary with ""Webster's New World Italian Dictionary: Italian/English, English/Italian"" and have been very satisfied. At the same time, I purchased ""Essential Italian Grammar"" by Olga Ragusaat, and Italian for Dummies.Essential Italian Grammar has been very helpful, but the Italian for Dummies hasn't been as useful.I should have ordered a complete verb conjugation book at the time.Free Delivery was extremely slow! Slow enough that I'll get my verb conjugation book through another channel."
1,What were they thinking???,"This was the worst movie that I've ever had the misfortune of trying to view. I can't imagine who would think that this video was fit for human consumption by anyone that made an effort to look at it. This is a dingy movie that looks as if it was shot in some sort of abandoned building. Make sure that you read the cover because I can barely tell you what the plot was about because of the poor quality of the sound. The acting was sub par (and I'm being really nice about this). I didn't recognize any of the actors with the exception of Robin Givens and I can't imagine why she would choose to entangle herself with such a mess of a project. Be aware....after falling asleep 10 minutes into the movie, my husband woke up, tried to look at it again, then left in the middle...I should have followed him!!!!!!!"
1,"Hilarious, only because it was so bad.","This movie was horrible, and they used poor Robin Givens to sell the movie. She barely had a role in the film, and her personal situation was irrelevant and random. Most of the movie takes place in an Apartment or Office building lobby that doubled as some sort of Hospital Waiting Room.....Camera is shaking, horrible mics, and annoying broadcasting quality.....This movie look liked a film major's sophomore year final. Save your money. I could not stop laughing at how random and cheap this movie was....I also hate the outcome, it was very unsettling...you had no one to root for or against and if you did, it didn't matter, cause the outcome was disappointing and the ending was random and ""are you serious""-worthy....the title doesn't even match the story line...especially not the tagline for it..."
2,Couldnt watch the whole movie,I tried to watch this movie because I love Robin Givens but this movie is awful. Its very low budget and majority of the movie is film in the waiting room.
1,ERROR NO FILE!!,"I bought this MP3 player about a month ago. I was using it and all the sudden my music stopped. So I looked at my MP3 player and it said that there was no file. I took it and I turned it off. Then I let it sit for about five minutes and then tried it again. This time it worked, but like the last time, it said that there was no file. I did this many times and it happened EVERY time. It was very annoying having to reastart it every five minutes. I hope the company will correct this problem, but in the mean time, I am out an MP3 player."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have several computers, none of them recognized this player, making it IMPOSSIBLE to load songs. Essentially I have a portable FM radio. Don't waste your money. I recently purchased a CREATIVE ZEN ... which I LOVE !"
4,Be careful of color,"Everything you expect from a trash can, thought this color was going to white but came red. It doesn't really matter but just not how it is shown in the picture..."
2,Lightly scented,"Very light scent, Paco Rabanne not seem authentic and it took a long time to be delivered. The way to apply the lotion is uncomfortable because the system does not bring the spray system."
4,Old fashioned gospel,"Classic gospel, enjoyed many of the tracks (minus one which was too much of an attempt at 'soulful' for their style). However, I grand CD to enjoy of you prefer the quartet-type gospel tracks."
2,Outdated reprint,"This is a new translation of a work originally written in 1935, updated in 1955. Those interested in the historiography of this topic may find it useful."
4,Collection of Research Articles & Papers,"This is an excellent book for people who have already taken atleast one course in CMOS Design or as a reference for people in the industry. A good background in understanding of CMOS circuits operation is a must, which generally will be the case for anyone who is considering this book. An excellent book for second year Grad students who have sufficient background and want to go deep into the modern VLSI Chip design methodologies and research."
1,Don't make this mistake!!!!,"The FP1500 is what can only be described as pricey garbage. After returning two units, I have given up completely on anything manufactured by AudioVox. Even if the TVs actually worked correctly, the user guide is apparently written by someone with English as a third language, and also omits basic (and potentially useful) information. Their customer support personnel are surly, and less than helpful. Be forewarned: steer clear of AudioVox, and especially this LCD fiasco."
2,It seems to work but...,"The HD its recognized as SATA, but at least in my case, it wasn't recognized at its full capacity. At first I thought it was a Bios or format problem but after trying everything I just changed my MB. Concluding, this adapter didn't solve my problems, maybe for others will."
1,DOA out of the package.,Don't waste your money this item doesn't work (tried 3 different computers/hard drives). Total donation of money/shipping and time.
1,Mental Scars,HORRIBLE ACTING I've seen elementary school plays that had better acting. NOT scary at all the deaths where comical they where so poorly acted. Looked like it was done with a home video camera. The kids in this where better actors then the adults
4,3P Component (ypbpr) Video Distribution Amplifier with Audio,Worked as advertised but instruction manual weak. I only had 2 out for the one in and they had to be on specific output ports. First connection did not work which worried me but outputs must be connected in numerical sequential order as labeled on box. Not mentioned in the manual that I could see. It allows me to use one cable box for 2 TV's so I can use the tv tuner on one and the cable box tuner on the other in whatever combination. Great for sports.
2,Not impressed with the output video quality,"I'm using this to split a component video signal to a few devices, to me the red signal is too hot and looks unnatural. On one of the longer cable runs the driving impedance seems to high and it's allowing noise into the signal. I just don't think it's a super-high quality unit.Your mileage may vary depending on the devices..."
4,Used in multiple displays .. great picture,"I wanted to try this product out to display my input to multiple displays. It displays it in multiple displays perfectly. Since I have older model devices, this came in handy because they were still using component cables. If I had newer equipment, I would have probably used something like thisViewHD 4 Port HDMI 1x4 3D Powered Splitter Ver 1.3 Certified for Full HD 1080P (One Input to Four Outputs). Overall very nice product if you're still using component cables."
5,Great product,This splitter amplifier works great. The delivery has been fast. It is very easy to install. Combine this splitter with an IR extender you can use only one cable HD decoder with two HDTV located in two differents rooms. With the IR extender you can control the cable decoder from the room that does not have the decoder. You can also use a spare component output to record HD programs on your computer.
5,Insanely good - like eating candy!,"Boy, do these things ever disappear in a nanosecond in this house! I have to bring home at least 4 boxes to just get them to last for more than 2 days! They are so amazing - fruit snacks covered in yogurt, wow. The kids just go nuts over them and have them daily as an afternoon snack. They're great for team snacks as well - seems like everyone just loves them. The strawberry seems to be the house favorite - just all over rich tasting and good. Fresh, very soft, something the kids just love. Highly recommend!"
3,Not flavors listed,"Though some reviewers received packages with the listed flavors, we received a box of 18 packages containing only the flavors strawberry & grape. For the price, will probably try buying again and see what we end up with since the kids aren't too particular."
5,Great Snack !,"This is not the first time I purchased these. They not only taste great, but the ingredients are healthy overall. A better choice in snacks than most. Sort of addictive but in a good way."
3,Basic good read,"Overall this was a fair book. Could have been more in depth and specific. Almost a general overview of the subject. Have read other, more detailed acounts of concentration camp demons. Quick read, gossip type. Would like to know more. Seemed to rely heavily on foot note info. Had more questions after reading than before."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting more in-depth exploration of the subject. The author spent a whole lot of time telling the reader that not much was known about the subject because people who would be in position to know her personally have not spoken out. It seems as if the author had attempted to write an in-depth look, was not able to secure interviews that would accomplish this, even after travelling extensively . He then just seemed to quote other author's works to complete the book. I just don't feel he had enough information to have written and advertised this work as the ""life and crimes of Irma Grese""."
4,Only book available :(,"This is the only book available on Irma Grese and its kinda of a let down. The author does a decent job of researching her and states that he is non-objective regarding her crimes and legacy, but seems to have certain attitudes and feelings regarding her as he makes evident throughout the book. She was a beautiful woman that got caught up in the insanity of the third reich and paid for her crimes with her life in the end."
2,not worth the money,"Although its an interesting read, not enough detail at all very short didnt really go into specifics of her treatment of the prisoners etc i was dissapointed but its not totally boring just wasn't what i was looking for."
4,"Great Bluetooth Headset,But Not The Ear hook","I like this headset great sound outgoing an incoming,but good luck on useing the earhook this headset works better without it,if it fits in your ear well,but I am happy with this one."
2,"Good Looks, Bad Static","Looks very cool. Very convenient charging via USB port. Not so good sound quality. Audio has a lot of static tics and pops and that is the only reason I give this 2 stars. Everything else is great.Pairs quickly with my Nextel i870.I lost my Plantronics 510, so will fall back to this unit until I can find the latest earpiece that has received good reviews. Other may have a great experience with this earpiece. Unfortunately, I am not one of them. Maybe I got a ""bad"" one."
2,Dissapointed,"I reserched this headset on line & it was well recieved by a couple High Tech Review websites. My experience has been a lot of trouble with phone to headset interfernce, dropped calls & poor battery performace"
2,GARBAGE,"PURE GARBAGE, THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY. i SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH MOTOROLA CONCERNING BLUE TOOTH EAR PIECES."
2,Didn't like it,"I bought it beacuse I needed to switch the earpice with 2 Bluetooth phones, a Cingluar 8525 and a i875, constantly. It did the job, but the earpiece was too big for my ear, wouldn't fit, and the button combination for the switching was a bit hard to accomplish. I bought a Cardo Scala 700 and its the best..."
2,Dissapointed with quality,"I recently purchased a BlueAnt X3 Micro, only to have it give no sound after a week or two. People could hear me, but I couldn't hear them. (I checked the volume!) I couldn't hear any tones when it turned on or off. Then the replacement came, and now after a week or so it won't charge. No lights come on, and it can no longer be switched on. I've tried the wall charger and the usb charger. I will have to ask for yet another replacement. When it works though, it is a great bluetooth headset, and works really well with my Nokia 6233 and has great sound. If it wasn't for these quality issues, I would recommend it totally."
3,OK but . . .,This headset is OK but if I had to do it again I would pick another headset. The cheap plastic ear hanger doen't fit my ear or my wife's so the head set always feels loose. I have to really shove it in my ear to get it to stay and then it pops out anyway. The sound quality is pretty good but it is just uncomfortable.
3,"Not bad, might not be the best for certain phones","You certainly can't beat the price of this headset.. If you buy directly from Verizon or Sprint, or any of the popular wireless companies, expect to pay close to $100 for it..I successfully made the bluetooth partnership right out of the box.. Maybe with my phone, the Audiovox XV6700 Pocket PC Phone, there is something screwy with my bluetooth setup.. I've had to re-create the partnership quite a few times.. And once, no matter how many times I recreated the partnership, I'd hear a weird fuzzy and scratchy sound coming from the headset, and it couldn't hear my voice.. Nor could I hear anyone talking..It's kinda flukey.. Depending on your phone, it should work just fine for the most part.. I don't really think any of the bluetooth headsets out there work perfectly yet.. But this one is a good buy for someone who is looking for something decently priced, and of a good brand.."
3,"didn't fit in my ear ,but seems like its a good piece","this piece didn't fit in my ear .the circlar thing which goes into the ear was a little bit larger .so i suggest to buy the piece from the store which has a good return policy and no stocking fee try it and then buy it from online .amazon returned me the money immediately ,but they haven't returned my shipping charges yet when i have send them the item back .i hope they return the shipping charges soon ."
4,it works!,"I haven't tried to do anything fancy with this headset yet, but I had no trouble getting it set up, and people I talk to can hear me okay (though not as well as when I just talk into the phone). My only issue is that it makes the battery on my phone run down much faster than I'm used to, but that seems like a problem I'd have with any headset."
2,The not so comfortable BlueAnt X3,I gave my BlueAnt X3 away to my brother because it was too big and the ear piece was also too big. The product just did not meet my standards.
4,Blue Ant Bluetooth,Very good bluetooth device. You can be heard clearly; you don't sound muffled to listening party.
3,good product but no accessories/replacements available,I bought this headset and it works well for the price I paid. Plus the accessories that come with this headset is amazing. You would have to pay extra for the different types of chargers. The sad thing is that I lost the charging cable/wire on a trip and now I can't charge my headset. I just hope I can get another cable/wire from Blue Ant.
2,CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW???,"FROM THE VERY FIRST SOUND OF MUSIC TO THE LAST PHONE CALL I MADE WITH THIS BLUETOOTH, I FELT I WAS MISSING SOMETHING . . . THE OTHER PEOPLE I WOULD TALK WITH KEPT SAYING WORDS LIKE: HUH! WHAT! SAY AGAIN! WE MUST HAVE A BAD CONNECTION! ETC!"
2,"it works, but ...","it sounds pretty badit's comfortable, the gooseneck usb cable is greati don't see the need for all the silly flashing lightsi got it for a great price and it works but the sound quality is pretty badpales in comparison to my Apple iPhone Bluetooth Headset (which they no longer sell)"
4,Surpassed my expectations.,"Upon renewing my wireless contract I got a Razor phone and quickly discovered I could no longer plug in my wired head set which I constantly use while driving. After much research I decided on the Blue Ant and I have been very pleased with it proformance thus far. I get 5 - 7 hours of talk time from a charge which for myself may be 2 days on the road. My biggest concern with a bluetooth set was how clear my voice would be received and I have had zero complaints. Oh, the price; it was 79.99 at the cell store, I got it under 55 dollars shipping included thru Amazon.I would reccommend this headset to anyone.Jim G.Gorham, Maine"
2,"OH, THAT PESKY STATIC!!!","Purchased this for my LG VX8300 phone. Loved the goodies that come along with it, and it fits my ear really well. Nice and light! Pairs really easy with my phone. But, I am getting a lot of static, even though I have a great Verizon signal, like always. With my phone shut, I can hear beaps when I press any button. Even, those beeps are interlaced with STATIC when heard through this headset. I press the Multi-function to activate the voice commands; and that communication between my phone and headset has static. Keep in mind, all this static is happening when my phone is a few inches away from the headset, clearly with a direct line of sight. I am returning this unit to Amazon.com. BUYER BEWARE!"
4,Blue Ant Review1,"I tried a motorola blue tooth ear piece and could not hear well with it. Bought the Blue Ant and can hear very well. I can use it with or without the ear hook. I like all the charging choices, but mine does not seem to hold a charge very long."
1,not worth it,the Ant is designed I guess for special peopleI found it very uncomfortible to wear and annoying to use
3,Not for small ears,"I read great reviews about this headset and the price was great. Some reviewers mentioned that the earpiece might be uncomfortable for people with small ears. I guess my ears are on the smallish side, but nothing exceptional, so I figured I'd be OK. I was wrong.The earpiece was huge. It didn't come close to fitting in my ear. The piece that goes around the ear, for those who want extra support, was about 1/2 inch too long. Really. My partner has large ears: the kind where a new hairdresser says things like we'll cut your hair so that it minimizes your ears. It fit him perfectly.I would say if you have normal sized girl ears or small boy ears, don't buy this device."
2,"Lots of pros, but one Major con for me","I loved the design of this item. Small, barely felt it on my ear, loved the different charging options, but...Maybe I recieved a defective item, or maybe I have too big of head. No one could hear me when I talked, even in a quiet room. Driving and talking was impossible. I decided to send it back and buy a headset with a boom mic. If you have a smaller head, it would probably work just fine. However, it wasn't functional for what I needed."
4,Good Device,"I really like my blueant device. I have very good reception and it is light-weight which is also a plus. The only thing that I dislike is the plastic earpiece that goes around my ear. Other than that, it is a recommended product to use for people on the go."
2,Hate.it.,"I've had it for 2 weeks and I'm trading this in ASAP. Everyone I talk to using it complains of echo and interference (voices). And while you can shut off the flashing blue light, you can't do so while you are already on a call. As a result, at night it's like having a freaking firefly on your ear. Very conspicuous and distracting."
2,This is not a MICRO headset,First of all this is not MICRO at all. It is large and bulky and does stay on the ear very well. The sound quality is poor for the person on the other end of the conversation. I use it with a Blackberry Curve PDA. I paid about double for the BlueAnt V-1 and for the money it is the best I've tried out of many bluetooths. Lesson here is you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money on this.
2,"Great little BT Headset, but with a major flaw","Received this headset today and was excited about having it. It connected with no issues to my BB 8310 and was working fine until I was on a call and received another one. I tried to switch over using the ""Answer"" key on the phone and while it did switch I had no audio. I then tried more test calls and got the same issue. I then called tech support and they informed me that the headset doesn't support call waiting? What kind of headset doesn't support that feature? It is because of this glaring flaw that I give this device two stars."
5,"Versatile, functional, good","It is simple the best bluetooth i've ever had. It pairs with my PDA and Laptop without any problem. Comes with car charger, USB charger, what else you could ask?"
2,You get what you pay for...,"This headset is cute but isn't the greatest. It doesn't fit smaller ears as it does large ears. The hook helps but isnt all that great, still have a hard time hearing and it picks up alot of background noise. People I talk to on the phone with say there is alot of static when I was driving with my windows all closed and with the phone in the passenger seat. It's usable, just not great."
1,Waste of my money!,"I can hear on it sometimes but when I try to use it no one can hear me clearly on the phone. On PS3, no one can hear my at all. Iguess you get what you pay for, I paid less then $10."
2,Too much static - unusable,"Looks great, feels alright and versatile charging options - all great features! However, none of them matter if the product doesn't work well.1. There is so much static on my end, even right next to the phone, that it drives me nuts! It feels like an old-school cordless phone, and a bad one at that!2. Everyone I talk to complains so much about the sound quality that they are hearing, I end up turning it off so they don't have to experience terrible quality too. It's one thing if I deal with it for convenience, but another to subject someone else to it.I guess in the end, you get what you pay for, and I should have realized that it was this low-priced for a reason. I would NOT recommend buying this headset."
1,"Poor Sound, Microphone and Battery","When you start talking after 30 seconds starts to sound even with all its charge, the person on the other side hears an echo, and one must speak loud enough for you to listen"
1,Small with poor fit and sound quality,"Pros: Small, Nice Charging optionsCons: Doesn't fit on ear well, constantly falling off. People on the other end consistently complained that they could not hear or thought they had a bad connection. Would not but this brand again."
4,happy with my blueant headset,"i like my blueant headset, good size for me, i hear clearly everyone can hear me. The only thing i don't like is that it won't stay in my ear and it sometimes fall out fit loose. Other than that i would buy it again"
1,Needs Work,I purchased this item because it was suppose to work on more then one bluetooth phone at a time. It will not - I contacted the support center and I am still waiting to hear back from them.
5,Great Headset,Great Headset I have owned 2 others.Motorola 850 and an Motorola H3This one by far is the best. Great quality clear and crisp.
3,Good for the money,"I have had the BlueAnt x3 headset for several months now and for the money, it is a decent headset. Comments from other reviewers are correct with regards to the echo on the receivers end when the volume is turned all the way up. The problem is that in most cars, it needs to be turned all the way up. I tried the gel ear piece and is isn't very comfortable. Although I may be something of a snob on that front since I changed from a Jabra wired headset that was so comfortable. Despite the echo, sound quality is acceptable on both ends of the conversation. I don't walk around the city much with it in, so I can't comment on wind noise. One of the big reasons I bought this headset was for the variety of recharge options it gives. In that, I am not disappointed one bit. Everyone should include a car adapter at the very least.Summary: Decent sound quality except for an echo with the volume at max, moderate comfort although secure in ear, great recharge options."
3,"It's good a few good features, but....","...three major flaws in my book: it has a tinny sound that is difficult to hear in a noisy environment, an ear bud that is uncomfortable, and only one size of ear hook that is too big for my ears. I'm not a petite or small person, but the earpiece won't stay on well, no matter how many ways I've adjusted it. Contacting the company to ask for a smaller ear hook resulted in a ""we're sorry, but we don't have one"" message. To their credit, they did reply promptly, but weren't of any help. I've seen this complaint from other people. Pros: The lanyard and clip are nice, the size and weight are small, and the chargers are awesome. Nevertheless, I will be returning this product and finding a more comfortable unit, even if it doesn't have as many ""features""."
3,Good features but mic could be better...,"I purchased & returned a previous one due to static & interference which BlueAnt's friendly tech support could not account for or help me fix...On the second purchase, everything paired easily with it and it sounds good, all features work well too. My only complaint is the mic picks up too much ambient noise at times such as road hum or nearby conversations. Other than this it works great."
4,Good product,"Overall, I'm very happy with this product. My only complaint is that the optional rubber cover isn't made very well. It comes right off very easily, and as a result, I've already lost the one and only cover included with this headset. Otherwise, a good product."
2,Could you repeat that?,Could you repeat that? That is all I hear when I am on this thing. I have to talk in my teacher voice (extra loud) so the person on the other end can hear me. I figured out the the problem is that the ear bud does not fit in my ear properly. I have to use the included ear gel to make it halfway fit but the I cannot hear the person on the other end either. I must admit that the lights on this ear piece are pretty. I am going to give this ear piece away and purchase anotherIOGEAR Bluetooth Wireless Headset.
2,"Bottom Line: Fuzzy, Erratic Reception","The BlueAnt X3 Micro has bad reception and range. I cannot put my phone in my pocket while using the headset, and my wife cannot put her phone in her purse and use it...there is far too much static, pops, etc... The X3 disconnects when I turn my head away from my phone. People I speak to using the X3 complain they cannot make out what I am saying, that the reception is full of static, and that it cuts in and out. The charging solutions for this device are great, but the bottom line is that the X3 does not deliver well on what it was designed to do."
3,BLUEANT X3 MICRO BLUETOOTH HEADSET,"IT'S A VERY NICE BLUE TOOTH, BUT THE FIT OF IT COULD BE IMPROVED UPON!! IT IS TOO LOOSE AND STICKS OUT FURTHER THAN NEED TO BE!!CECELIA P.LOS ANGELES, CA."
3,Can you hear me now? NO!,"I have had this device for about a week now and i am a little disappointed. It doesn't fit well on my ears however that could be due to my ears being smaller than Normal. Also everyone has a hard time hearing me. They either say that i am muffled or to quiet even when i am talking loud. Its a decent product and seems durable but i own a business and need people to hear me when im talking. It cam with a car charger, wall charger and a number of ear muffs and ear holsters.I dont care about the blue light but would rather not have it."
4,BlueAnt X3,"This is one cool little headset. It is lightweight and comfortable. I have purchased quite a few headsets looking for a comfortable one and this is it. Only disappointment is that it does not stay in my ear without the ear guard, which is what I was really looking for. I could never wear an earguard with my sunglasses comfortably, but for some reason this ear guard does not get in the way. I love being able to charge the unit right in the car. Sound is great and the controls are simple. I've tried Motorola and Plantronics, and like this one the best!"
3,Tough fit for little ears,"I was really excited about this as the product got really good reviews, but unfortunately it's too big for my ears. Not a good fit for those of you with diminutive ears. Unfortunately I didn't read the return policy closely and wasn't able to return this in time, so I'm stuck with a headset that doesn't fit. Someone's getting it for Christmas I think!"
5,A Cool Headset!!!!,"I went through a lot of reviews before buying the X3 and I have to say that I'm quite satisfied with my decsion on buying the X3. One bad remark I always noticed on the X3 reviews were about the speaker not fitting in the ear bud. I guess people expect too much and want everything perfect, well I would say the headset is very comfortable and fits with ease once you use it with the earloop. I have had no problems in any aspect of the X3 whether it is design, sound qulaity or features.I own a Samsung D807 phone and I had a Motorolla H605 headset before which suffered with voice clarity problems. The X3 is as cool as the H605(not like a weird thing hanging on the ear) and the voice clarity is excellent.It's really worth the price with all the different chargers and the cool features it comes with. I can finally stop my quest for bluetooth headsets and breathe a sigh of relief.Way to go Blueant!!!"
2,Fragile,"This little device seemed perfect at first, but it quickly became a real hassle. Sound was good, fit was good, weight was great. But it regularly drops its connection and is often a beast to reconnect with the Treo it was purchased for use with. My wife dropped it from a modest height the other day and it split apart and will not go back together. For the price, i am not happy with the purchase."
3,Annoying Static,I agree with other reviews about the design features and charging options but those things come secondary if static over takes them. The static is real even the phone is only inches away from the unit. Unlike my earlier Bluetooth devices this one has really short range...like 3 feet. I can not live with static so this one is going back.Sorry Blueant.
2,Has problems,"I bought this item on seeing many positive reviews here and on other sites. I liked the design, easy access to keys and ability to charge the device in a different ways.As advertised the device connected effortlessly to my LG VX8300 (Verizon) phone.Unfortunately, the voice reception quality was very poor. I had to speak in a very loud voice -- even in a quiet room -- for it to correctly transmit my voice to the phone. In the car with the windows rolled up and radio turned off -- I was unable to get it to pick up what I said.The ear clip design is poor and my piece became loose within a day of use.I may have received a defective piece -- since my negative review appears to be an outlier. I wanted to share my experience for the benefit of people purchasing this item."
4,"Quality headset, comfortable and convenient","The small size and light weight make this a comfortable headset to use. You can use it without the ear hook, if your ear is the right size. The insert is comfortable as well. Great sound quality both for the wearer and the person you are talking to.The operation is slightly confusing until you read the instructions start to finish."
3,Really a BlueBUG,I was attracted to the Blue Ant for it's price and the included chargers. Set up was simple to my Samsung SCH-U740 Verizon phone. The very first day I used it in my vehicle it was nearly impossible to get it to fit my ear and adjust the volume. When attempting to adjust the volume and the Blue Ant's (+) and (-) buttons are very tiny on the outskirts of the center button and it's not that simple. Overall sound quality is decent after you mess around with positioning it in the ear and get the volume right. I will have to try something other than this Ant or I will be breaking New Jersey's dumb law and holding my phone to my head when driving.
4,Very Nice,"Ordered and received a couple days later with Amazon Prime's free 2-day shipping. Haven't had any problems yet (but have only been using for a week). The controls do take some getting used to, but once you figure out the simple pattern it's relatively easy. Folks with very large fingers may have trouble (but I suspect these tiny things -- no matter what brand -- may offer challenges for larger fingers, in general).I use this with my personal cell and my work blackberry in the car and it's great. Never have to dig for those things in the bottom of my purse again! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the sound quality could be better."
4,A True Southeast Asia - 5 years Ago,"I am planning a trip to Burma. I found the production quality excellent and the information well presented. I wish that something of this quality was even more recently made. I know Vietnam, having visited in 1999. The Vietnam segment is an excellent view of the people, history, and sights. Much of what is foretold in this 5-year old video is happening today. I can highly recommend this set as part of your learning about these countries."
3,Interesting video,"I had previously viewed the version of this documentary that has Martin Sheen narrating, and I have to say I prefer that one. Martin Sheen's voice adds a drama to the video that Rick Ray doesn't really communicate. The documentary itself is very interesting, but potential buyers should note that the section on Cambodia is less than 20 minutes long, while the Burma section is around 40 minutes, with the rest being about Vietnam."
3,Not as expected.,"It's too bad, but I rented this film thinking it was narrated by Martin Sheen when it wasn't. This is not the PBS version. It is narrated by the film maker. Not that he did a bad job, it was just not what I expected. Good, somewhat quiet film. Students might find it a little too quiet. I'm curious to know if the PBS version is better in this regard. I like the fact that it covers three different countries in one film."
2,Snippet.....,"I bought this disc for the single song ""Trick Me"". What I didn't see was the word SNIPPET next to it. So, if you like Milkshake, go ahead and purchase. If you're looking for another song, get the album."
3,Illuminating but gets old quick,"Walter Anderson was an extremely unique and interesting fellow. After hearing about him, I wanted to see some of his paintings and read more about him. The book has many color plates which will give you more than a feel for his style. The introductory chapter provides a nice biography and is in large measure an essay on his artistic style and philosophy, as viewed by Redding Sugg, jr. The bulk of the book, (pages 38 to 236)are transcribed log entries by the artist himself. I am glad that what was included was included, but after about the 100th page of ""today I saw a duck. A boat went by. I drew a Pelican. The wind was blowing....."", it gets a bit boring. Still, I wanted to learn about this guy and I feel that, having read the book, I have done so."
2,not what I expected,I believed this DVD would be the movies itself but it was clips and how they were created. I was upset as it was a gift.
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"As a fan of Ray, I was so happy to get my hand on this. I bought it for the mature film lover in myslef, but my three year old sister loves to watch the fairy tales and nursery rhymes. It is superb in every way."
4,Recommended for avid fans of Ray H.,"very classic and old, if you're collecting Ray H. movies, this one is a must. But if you just want old movies, you might not like it that much, this one are a collection of his first movie special effects clips, you might want to consider the other 2 box collections available here in amazon too, which i also happen to have, their nice good old movies and classic too. Search for Ray Harryhausen."
2,so LONG!!!!!!!!!!!,"the book lays out some great points but fails to really define key points. what it likes to do is bring up a term or a topic, then just bombard you with examples (most of the examples is about Clinton being impeached, Bush & Gore, and Obama) and forget to really explain the topic or term in detail.unnecessary information is put in it and it's SO LONG it makes me NOT want to read it. make a 5th edition and cut out all the unnecessary examples. go straight into the topics and terms, explain in detail (STOP USING SO MANY OF THE SAME EXAMPLES) IT'S SO DRY i don't even think the TAs read the book in detail!"
3,"3 stars for effort, but not well-executed","Kernell and Jacobson try to combine historical and rational-choice understandings of American government in this text, but not in a particularly successful manner. The issues of collective action and free rider problems are above the heads of most undergraduates, who care about what actually happens in politics, not what a game-theoretic model in a book thinks should happen.The writing style is also very dense. It's not particularly engaging for the reader, and the occasional cutesy attempt to insert cartoons or other stylistic improvements falls flat. The history is very interesting to someone who cares, but doesn't show the average student why history is important, why it matters that they know it in order to properly understand American politics today.For a slightly better take on an American government textbook with a historical focus, take a look at Landy and Milkis' new textbook."
1,Mistake,"The picture doesn't match with the descriptions. I recieve the Wheel Masters 180 Degree and the picture show one of 90 and 120 degree, not 180.I waste my money.[...]RGDSAndro Scaramelli"
1,Trash,"I guess you get what you pay for. I didn't pay anything for this system, so it was really no lose.Within a month after setting this thing up, the fan in the box begin to really get loud. Within a month after this, the fan quit working all together. Within a month of that, the whole unit quit.I now know why Audiovox only has a 90 day warranty on this system. It'll last about 100 days."
2,Audiovox DV1201 5.1-Channel DVD Home Theater System,I had this stereo for 2 years before all but two of the speakers and the Subwoofer cords snaped the connections are not very great I would suggest saving you money and buying a better quality stereo.
1,Don't waste your time!,I bought this for a small bedroom amd packed it right back up! It sounds like a kids toy! I couldn't get very many music stations...there in NO bass and it is made as cheap as I've ever seen one...Do not waste your time. I kick myself for buying this...
2,HOME THEATER,"IT IS GOOD BUT,REAL SMALL AND THE BUILT IN RADIO DOES NOT WORK SOMETIME. THE SELLER IS SUPPER AAAA."
2,Audiovox 200 watt system,I'M 14 AND YOU SHOULD READ THIS BEFORE THINKING ABOUT BUYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This looks pretty cool but like most items it gets old really fast! There are many things you can do with it and I thought it was really hard to put together because there are so many wires. This system has good sound and it goes fairly loud. If you wanted a a nice system I would not pick this Audiovox. Only get this item if you want a small surrond sytem for your room. It is good for parties and for watching some movies if thats what your looking for.
5,Documentary Goes Beyond the Ordinary Style,"This documentary film is truly a work of art. Unlike many documentaries that simply turn the camera on an interesting subject, Lucia Small works magic to bring creativity and personal interest to her story both in front of and behind the scenes to make the subject and this film so engaging. Telling the story of her father, she interweaves critique, engagement, surprise, frustration, and a sense of wonder at her father's continuing belief in himself as the true artist who has simply been misunderstood. Any daughter of any father growing up in the seventies will appreciate this!"
5,A whakky father following his passion,"A really great story about a father, from a daughter, providing insight into the mind of an eccentric genius that so many of us can identify with in some weird way or another. Very enjoyable ride with a lot of great humor. I wish my dad was like him,.. kinda!"
4,"Attractive, functional","The Macbook cover fits perfectly. I like the small inner retaining flap that keeps the Mac in place even if the zipper is open, and protects the Mac from any contact with the zipper. It's an elegant touch. Nice wide zipper that will last. My daughter uses this (both the mac and the sleeve)...the red color is a stand out at school."
3,Works as a sleeve,"This sleeve protects the macbook well, nothing flashy. Will only help from scratches while moving the macbook from place to place."
3,"It's okay, but...","I bought the sleeve for my MacBook, and it fits perfectly, kind of a sleek-looking thing. I needed something that protects the laptop from getting scratched when I put it in the carry-all with all my other electronic gadgetry, and it does that. BUT, I discovered Target has something similar (not in cool red) with a HANDLE and SIDE POCKET for $10 less."
4,Just Right,We had been looking for a red slip cover for a few months. The Apple shop could not help so we bought this cover. It is perfect for what we wanted and very easy to use.
4,Works well,"Does a good job protecting my laptop, fits well in tote bag. No complaints so far.I am not bothered by the lack of pocket for mouse or cord. The purpose of a laptop is to be portable. Get one with good battery life is what I suggest."
3,Decent case for a decent price,"This item has an good fit, and is durable. It makes a good protective cover for placing your MacBook in a backpack or bag.Downsides are that the inside has a flap to fit over the top of the MacBook which it waterproof but makes it difficult to quickly take your laptop in and out."
5,Superb case,"If you have a MacBook then it is the best case you can get for the money you pay. There is only one thing I don't understand - why did Amazon classify it as ""ELECTRONICS""?"
3,Not bad but not great either,Very good protection sleeve for the Macbook but is not a carring case. No handles or strap. As other have reported the zipper is protected from scratching your laptop.
5,FABULOUS!,"I used to manage a book store that carried only children's literature, thus have read hundreds upon hundreds of children's books. Tico, is in my humble opinion, simply one of the very best.Gorgeous illustrations, beautiful relevant message - I would even say that this book is perfect.Bravo Leo Lionni! You have done it again."
5,Tico / Lionni The Original Rainbow Fish,"This story line is familiar if you've read The Rainbow Fish, but Tico pre-dates that story. Tico is also a more profound, developed story. Happy, re-assuring ending. Sensitive and precient in this age of me me me."
1,Very harmful message.,"The main message of this book is that you should not be different, because if you are you will be rejected by your peers. This is not a message I want to transmit to my children.The only good point about this book is the art. It is really beautiful. The best use for this book is to cut pictures for paper craft, scrap booking, ext."
1,Very upset,"I am so disgusted that I woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a Dora toddler bed. I held the Dora toddler bed until christmas, when on Christmas eve I went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong and I was unable to assemble the bed at all. I ended up returning the bed, in exchange fr nothing. I found out that they no longer carry the bed."
1,dora deserves better,"wow- cheap plastic, poorly routed holes, took 1/2 an hour to finally reach the conclusion that the screws could not align properly due to bad construction - sent it back - my daughter loved the Dora picture and was very sad that she couldn't keep it."
1,i am not pleased,"i am not satisfied with this bed the metal rods along the bottom that are supposed to hold the matress up are constantly falling out causeibg the matress to sink. my child is 2 and hates this bed , i do not recommend it to anyone with a toddler i am tryng to return it myself"
5,JAPANESE TSUBA LIBRARY IN A BOOK,The author description is accurate. Very difficult to find this much information at such a low price. Must have book for the collector. Color cover with b/w images to the contents.
4,"An Insightful, Easy Read","While on my search for truth, I stumbled one year ago upon the nine principles of Spiritualism, finding that my own personal philosophy aligned with eight of the nine, and I find myself exploring the ninth principle for personal validation. At the very least, the book is a fascinating look into how Spiritualist mediums do their readings and lends an appreciation as to why they are pretty accurate on one's major issues but not 100% accurate on all issues.I will purchase another one of Elizabeth Owens' books, as this one is fascinating and, having been to Cassadaga, FL three times in the past, can relate to some of the characters (meant tongue in cheek) whom I've actually met. I'll keep you posted on whether Elizabeth Ownens' book actually helps to develop the talent."
5,Simple solution to a potential costly replacement,"All the time you hear of tailgates being stolen. This is a simple, effective, and durable way to protect your tailgate. Is it perfect no but it should make it bothersome enough where they will move to the truck down the row.The lock is easy to install, takes only minutes and comes with a security bolt that will make it much harder to simply remove the lock. If you don't want to use the security bolt you can use a traditional hex head bolt which is also included.It comes with two keys. Could not be a simpler solution to a potential costly replacement of a tailgate."
1,A book that undermines its own arguments,"When I was a freshman in high school, a religious great aunt sent me this book because she had heard that I was interested in science. Up to that point it had not actually occurred to me to question the account of creation in Genesis. After reading this book, however, and considering its contrived arguments, I became convinced that testable scientific theories (e.g. Darwinian evolution and modern astrophysics) offered better explanations for the origin of the world. Ironically, this book led me away from a literal reading of the Bible to more allegorical interpretation."
2,Biblical Creation attempts to be a science,"Morris believes that the Bible can be scientifically proven. This is impossible, since the Bible is a religious text. It is an interesting read, but keep in mind that Morris uses bad science and fallacy after fallacy to make his religion look scientific."
1,Scary choice for serious backcountry use...,"I'm on my second Terra Summit; the first was replaced by the vendor (not Amazon) after its crystal got heavily scratched and fogged and the bearing markers for compass wore off on a single 4 day backpacking trip. This time I took it in the woods, got turned around, and soon was seriously lost because... the compass doesn't work! No matter where I pointed it, it was ""SSW"". This isn't a mistake I can afford to make and next trip this watch is staying home."
2,Returned 3 times,"I like this watch a great deal but have had to return it 3 times in 9 months. Each time Highgear customer service was very helpful, but they have had to replace it each time as well. It just freezes up and no buttons worked. I have twice tried new batteries, but that didn't work either (for long).I like the watch very much and wish it was reliable."
1,nothing more than a simple watch,"The watch was awesome until a month into ownership and the temp/alt/baro function stopped working and the girlfriend threw away the reciept. although i just ordered a casio pathfinder. the weather icon is nice but knowing how to read a barometer is a lot more simpler. Cheap price, cheap watch"
3,Highgears Summit watch,"For the first three months it was pretty nice. The watch band eneded up breaking away from the base unit. It was too late to return it for a refund. Amazon only has a poor 30 day policy for refunds. I tried to have the watch band fixed at a local watch specialist shop. No one in my area could do it. The actual connections to the watch housing broke. I tried several shops and 4 months later it still sat on my dresser. Actually it's been a year now the watch is still running well, but telling time/temp/alt/bara from a drawer now instead of my wrist. I am sending it soon back to Highgear to either fix the watch band or replace it. Their rep has informed me that there is a 2 year warantee on the Summit. I wish Amazon would have told me that when I purchase it."
4,"Great for picking up Obj-C 1.0, don't use for learning the framework","This is a great book if you want to learn objective-c 1.0 and are looking for a quick read. It assumes that you have no programming experience which makes it really easy and provides a good refresher on C based programming in case it has been a while for you.If you are looking for a book on the foundation framework with the intention of doing some programming on the Mac then look else where. This book does not cover the entire framework and its material is a little dated.!Take Note! This book covers objective-c 1.0 so it does not cover ""properties"" and ""fast enumeration"" which were the major features added to objective-c 2.0 which is the current version of objective-c."
4,Good Introductory Book You Can Read Quickly,"I wanted a book I could read very quickly. This book was written in an easy-to-learn style and I plowed through it really quickly. It is intended as a very introductory book and if you have any knowledge already of Objective-C it might be a bit basic, sometimes even a bit too basic. The first part is the basics of the Objective-C language second part is an introduction to some of the more important parts of the Foundation Framework (but not AppKit). Overall I enjoyed the book because it met my needs of a quick introduction/overview book that I could read quickly."
4,Good book to teach yourself,"This book was quite easy to read. Although I have some limited programming experience, I think this would be easy for someone who is not expereienced in programming at all. The exercises and descriptions in the book were easy to understand and helped by having you write code that applies the principles in ways that reinforce the ideas. My one knock on the book is that it does not go into Xcode which is what you use to develop code on a Mac. However, I think that might be another book in itself for those of us that aren't very experienced with programming."
2,Out of date,"It was what I ordered, but I didn't realize I was buying the 2004 version. A lot has changed since then. I meant to buy the 2.0 version."
2,"Avoid if (1) you know C, or (2) you want something thoughtful!","In general, this gets high marks from most reviewers, but I did not like it. I think the reason is that I have been a fairly competent C programmer for many years. So half the book was telling me things I already knew (what is a++ etc). Even worse, the other half had an elementary viewpoint. It was intended to help you rote learn mindlessly.As I read about the language features I did not know, many obvious questions occurred (Why on earth would anyone use this apparently kludgy and inefficient NSNumber class? How does init differ from a C++ constructor?). But there was no intelligent discussion of such issues, you were left to figure it out for yourself.There were also too many minor typos in the code examples."
5,Great book to get started with Objective-C,"This book was a great help in learning the Objective-C language. It focuses on the language and touches on sme specific areas of Cocoa. A vetran C++ programmer, I found this book to be a quick way to come up to speed on Objective-C.The organization is well thought out and clearly written. It would be a great book for a someone who has never programmed in C and for vetrans wishing to learn a new language. The book is easy to read and organized in a manner that makes it quite useful as a reference after reading it."
1,Assumes no programming experience,"This books assumes the reader has no programming experience at all. I can't imagine choosing Objective-C as a first language. And if you are, I would discourage you from doing so.If you have some software programming experience at all, you will find most of this book a waste of time and space on your shelf."
4,An unexpected rare gem of a set...,"This generous 2 CD Tchaikovsky only program is a bargain winner! Veronika Dudarova and her obscure Russian orchestral forces will give allof her more esteemed male counterparts a run for their money. She is well served by the engineers and studio acoustics. The sound is vivid and spacious, never lacking in detail. There are moments of demonstration quality. Dudarova's approach is a little on the slow side,but she captures all that is sublime, leading up to the great climaxes.The track listing is as follows:Disc A: 1-Festive Overture on the Danish National Anthem, 2-Fatum, 3-Fantasy Over.: Romeo and Juliet, 4-Symphonic Fantasy: The TempestDisc B: 1-Symphonic Fantasy: Francesca da Rimini, 2-Capriccio italien, 3-1812, Ceremonial Over., 4-Fantasy Over.: Hamlet"
3,The Complete Guide to Real Estate Finance,"This book is excellent for learning the basics in real estate financing. It leads us to the items that we should consider before making investment decisions. However, two aspects in the book disturbs me. One, the author makes undisguised effort to use the book as a meadium to promote his other products, such as books or computer softwares. Two, he allocates about one chapter to preach his life philosophy that is wholy unrelated to the subject matter of the book. Although I am glad that I have learned basics about real estate financing from this book, I don't think I will buy another book from this author."
4,"A great knife, and a good price","The knife is not only good for cutting bread, but also tomatoes. In other words, it cuts items with a hard ""crust"" and a soft inside."
5,Simply Wonderful,"I absolutely adore the little book of ""Steamy Erotic Poetry""I have read it several times... and it is sincerely a treat!!!I think perhaps I would have labeled it more sensual than erotic...but this little book is simply wonderful!!! It is filled with love,sensuality and a smooth blend of eroticism... I was mostimpressed... I am happy to have had the opportunity read it..."
5,What can I Say!!!!,"Each and every one, eitherput a smile on my face or made me want more lines.Erotic in a very tasteful way and you can 'feel' thewords. Everything fits and flows with a rhyme thrownin at just the right places. Liked the format also,quite a change. Want more!!"
1,Stability ball review,I purchased both a 55cm and a 65cm Go Fit Ultimate Burst Resistant Core Stability Ball for personal use. So far I am very dissapointed with it as they lose air and are not round. You try to roll them and they are very lopsided. Would not purchase this brand again. Very disappointed with it.
2,It's a ball,"I don't know why I thought a big orange ball would enhance my exercise routine. I used it once and then gave it to a 12 year old friend. Nah, thanks anyway."
2,"Too small for 5'3"" person","I chose the size to purchase based on the item description. I am 5'3"" tall and have average proportion. I do not have long legs, if anything they are short! This ball doesn't even come up to my knee. Even the enclosed DVD is demonstrated with a larger ball! Since I have inflated it and tried to use it, I cannot return it. I now know that a 65cm ball is the right size for most women. I wasted money on this one and hope to save someone else from making the same mistake. The ball is good quality but truly sized for a child."
3,Fairly Decent,"This book is a decent chemistry book that does a good job in covering chemistry material. Although there are not enough example problems in the book to gain a good understanding of the ""math"" goes on chemistry. The book doesn't provide goods STEPS in chemistry problems. For example, the text lacks a section that tells teh student how to draw a Lewis Dot Structure and the steps to determine bonds. This text also has labs but they aren't really that good.The book does offer good examples of realife chemistry in action. Things are organized well with good charts, graphs, and summary tables. The book problems are o.k. but one should supplement the book with another excercise book. It's easy too understand and good for first year chem only."
2,Usability is low,"This atlas tries to cram as much information as possible without any consideration for how the information will be used. Particularly distressing is the type of binding which makes it impossible to see some areas of a given country when spread across two facing pages. Sometimes a large map of a country is provided with missing areas and one has to go to a smaller, less detailed map of a country if one is interested in that area.I cannot recommend this atlas to anyone. I would rather have an older but more usable atlas than this supposedly very modern and detailed atlas that is unusable."
3,Ruthless beat-up,"Lots and lots of good drum and base alike beats covered with slightly monotonic synth. The ever changing tempo of all stories is somewhat exhausting. The intros to all stories are a bit too long. The occasional humming bagpipe sounds do not seem to give the extra punch to the concept. Still, I like the album a lot."
2,A little on the light side,"The bike rack arrived quickly. I am able to mount two bikes on the rack without difficulty. The weaknesses are enough to make me wish I had paid a little more and possibly gotten a stronger, more durable rack. If you are attaching the rack to a 2"" mount, you have two choices, additionally purchase a steel adapter or watch your bike bouncing and swaying because of the plastic adapter included with the rack. In addition, the plastic bike tube brackets have no locking mechanism, so the bikes will slide to and fro during transit. In addition, the velcro straps are not designed to allow for a tight hold on the bikes. Also, the straps after two weeks have begun to fray and delaminate. I use the rack to transport my bike for a mile or two each day. I won't use the rack to transport my bike on any of our busy highways or interstates."
5,I am the King of the Seven Sea-Monkeys!,"When I was a wee lad of 10, I walked inside Spencer's Gifts in South Florida. After sampling some edible underwear, and looking inside every stupid cardboard box gag gift, I saw this incredible blister pack of Sea-Monkeys. I'd seen the ads in comic books, and was still gun-shy of comic book mail order after the ""corrugated cardboard"" submarine fiasco (fits two, My Aunt Mimi!), but there it was, the grail of grails.The kit I'm reviewing harkens back to those halcyon days, and the goods still delivers. USE DISTILLED WATER, PLEASE!!! You want your monkeys to live, or what? You could pay less for a basic set, but you gotta swoon over the retro graphics of this set. Buy it, puhleeeeze!"
1,bad experience,"at this time i only see water,but that was not the problem, the problem is that i am buying from el salvador,the shipping cost me the same as the toy, and i hope for those who bought this toy, and live in the U.S. that the warranty be for real."
1,The eggs didnt hatch,"We followed all the instructions to purify the water etc but the eggs did not hatch, we were so disappointed"
2,expensive to use,"The crystals are hard to find at stores around us, and are very expensive. We returned ours to order a jewel punch-type tool instead."
2,Should be called Annoy not Inoi,"This is a very good MP3 player, when it works.Two downsides, one is major1)In my first day of use the unit would not turn on. I returned it to CompUSA the next day. I have only had the unit for 5 months and again the same thing happened. The unit is dead and will not turn on. I will call the company and see if they will replace it for me. Their English is really bad too.2) not so easy to scroll through playlists. To avoid the hassle of scrolling through a folder with 100 songs I needed to break up that folder in to 2 or 3 folders to make it more manageable. The scroll wheel on the Ipod takes care of that.The problem with many reviews is that people don't let time pass and see how the something works over time. That is the most important. The Inoi has failed me twice in less than 6 months."
5,A Must Read!,I throughly enjoyed this book. I love the way Debra White Smith weaves mystery and romance and a little comedy together to make a superb book! Not knowing if Beth would choose Micheal or Scott kept me on the edge of my seat! I also enjoyed Beth's pet pig! I hope you read and enjoy it as much as I did!
5,One Great CD !!!!,This is a true Hall and Oates cd. It has all the right elements. Which make it a great cd.
2,"BIG HALL & OATES FAN, BUT DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD","Being a big Hall & Oates fan, and seeing them several times in concert, I thought this CD would be one I would enjoy. Except for a couple of songs (notably ""I'll be Around"" and ""Ooh, Ooh, Child""), I was mostly disappointed in the duo's covering of these soul songs. This was not Hall & Oates' best effort."
5,Hall and Oates do it again!,"Our Kind of Soul should be a part of everyones cd collection. Daryl Hall sounds great as usual. His voice is truly one of the greatest of all time. He is vastly underrated. The 3 original songs are classic H@O. I have a special feeling for ""Don't turn your back on me"". The re-makes are done very nicely and Hall and Oates add their spin to them. Among my faves are ""Rock Steady"" which is real funky. Hall and Oates really rocked it on that one! Also ""Neither one of us"" is a classic ballad that made my girlfriend cry the first time she heard it! Other good ones are ""Used to be my girl"", and ""After the dance"". Lastly, ""Still in love with you"" may be the best song on this cd! It is a classic and I am sure Al Green is proud that his song was done so well. Bravo to Hall and Oates! Can't wait for the next one!"
5,My Kind of Soul,"Normally I don't like artists rehashing each others work but after listening to these cuts all I can say is, wow! The first time that I heard Hall & Oates version of ""I'll be Around"" I thought that the Spinners had reissued it. If you buy this album for only one song, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the rest. There are even a few nuggets on here that may be difficult to obtain in other forms, my favourite being the Five Stairstep classic ""Ooh Child"" (originally O-o-h ). There are ""rememories"" here for everyone. Sure, opinions are that there could be a song or two left off or added but Hall & Oates covered the ones that were important to them. This isn't a recording by a twosome who's better days are behind them, rather a twosome that is paying homage to the music that influenced their works and I for one wondered why it took this long. It was time. And I hope a followup soon to come."
4,Good CD,A good selection of tunes and mixes. My only semi-criticism is that the percussion seems a bit heavy. The bass needed to be turned down on my CD player and in the car.
5,Incredibly wonderful CD--Maybe my favorite ever!,"I bought this CD a while ago--and could hardly stop listening to it! Listened to it on the computer at work, in the Discman at the gym, and also at home. I have bought it for friends. I seem to never get sick of it. Saw Hall & Oates in Seattle recently--bought the CD of the concert!!--and feel they are only getting better and better with age. Their voices & musicianship are superb...and this CD shows it. The ""Blue-Eyed Soul"" duo is playing soul like their voices & style were meant for it. I can't wait until they make a follow-up--and can't wait for their new Christmas album to be released. I recommend this CD more than any other I own--which is a lot! I love, Love, LOVE it, and hope you will, too!"
2,H&O Bring Nothing to the Table,"I'm a casual fan of Hall & Oates, so I figured I should check out this album . . . wrong! The only songs that sound good on this album are ones that sound exactly like the originals. Anyone who's considering buying this album should just find the original singles on iTunes or something and save their money because H&O, at best, are delivering generic interpretations of some classic music."
2,Stop the madness,"First Michael McDonald drains all the soul from classic Motown tunes then H&O; proceed to wreak havoc with classic soul from every era. STOP THE MADNESS! To even suggest that H&O;'s Rock Steady can even be mentioned in the same breath as Aretha's is blasphemy. What are you people thinking? Obviously you are not familiar with the originals cause, these covers sound more like bad karaoke than well arranged songs. I don't take issue with Daryl Hall being described as a soul singer, but the arrangements are tedious at best.If you want to hear real soul, start with any Rhino ""Didn't It Blow Your Mind"" compilation with the original tracks by the original artists."
5,Classic Soul at It's BEST!!,"Our Kind Of Soul is one of the best CDs of true soul classics available. Some of the best classic soul tunes are on this CD, and performed as only H&O; could. Among my favorites is their version of Barry White's ""Can't Get Enough of Your Love"". Daryl's voice makes it clean, crisp, and makes you want to listen over and over. Another fantastic track is their rendition of ""Ooh Child"", which sounds even better the original. My personal favorite is ""Used to be My Girl"". Daryl makes you feel the sentimental loss of the vocalist. Absolutely unbelievable!""Soul Violins"" and ""Don't Turn Your Back on Me"" both remind me of the great classic H&O; tunes. Perfect blend of harmony that no one can come close to.Overall, if you need a fantastic album to add to ""your kind of soul"" collection, be sure to pick up ""Our Kind of Soul"". You won't be sorry..."
4,Veio Grátis numa Revista,"Eu comprei esse disco numa banca de jornal em Burgos, Espanha. Estava de bobeira e quis comprar um cd pra ouvir no walkman. Esse foi o mais barato que eu encontrei. E no final, achei o disco muito bom. Blues clássicos tocados por um dos cardeais da parada. Vale a pena."
4,easy to take off,"I bought this sneaker couple weeks ago for my 9 months baby girl. It even cute for girl not just for boys, the design and color is vibrant and stunning and the material is light weight , unfortunetely it easy to take off by my baby, every time i put it on her, its always easy for her to take it off unlike robeez"
5,Excellent!,Excellent choice of songs from The Chieftains. Always good but this is the real deal! The sound is always refreshing no matter how many times you hear them.
4,The EssentialChieftains,Nice collection of this groups music I have been looking for and wanted for many years. I would recommend this disc for fans of this group
5,Very Satisfied,"I purchased this book as a gift for my husband, whom is a follower of the Norse Path and already owns several books from the same author. I find Thorsson's approach to both the theory and the practise of the Norse Path to be really useful and practical, without over simplyfying the conceptual part. I also find him to be a writer who is very respectful of the historical sources, and at the same time leaves a lot of room for seasoned practitioners to add their own touches to ritual and prayer. I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I intend to continue purchasing books from this writer."
3,Early 90's Troth Propaganda,"This particular book has some useful information in it, such asholy tides, but is wrought with christian damage throughout andpropaganda for the Ring of Troth circa the early 1990's when Edred Thorsson was running the organization. The whole anti-baptism ritual is completely rediculous, as it assumes that said person is 1)Christian and 2)That one's faith/troth is comparable to Christian belief. I absolutely hated this concept. The rituals have a very Ceremonial magick feel, not organically Heathen at all. I find this book to be somewhat overrated, and definitely not essential heathen reading...this work falls a bit short."
4,Does the job,"Its okay! It shipped pretty fast. Its actually the Vortex II though. It can be loud when playing. It is not meant to be used all the time, but when your overheating, or see a bit of fog ( I use thermals and fog slightly) turn the fan on for 30 seconds. I would suggest buying this product to anyone playing Paintball, and wearing a mask ( Reffing/Playing) for more then 20-30 minutes at at time."
4,We will see,"Appears to do what it's supposed to do. Weathers been cold so will have to wait for the humidity to do the ""acid"" test."
2,Does not look the same,The product I received is Vortex II. I looks diferente from the one displayed on this article. Looks weak and really is. I am not sure if was worth to buy it.
4,Pretty flowers,"Works well with fondant, much to small and petals are too thin for cookies. Great daisy shape and it's nice to have the graduated sizes for different projects!"
2,Difficult to use,"I have not been able to use this shape successfully. The petals are thin and fondant (or cheese or any other material) gets stuck in the space. Petals are delicate and break off. I could be just totally clumsy, but so far I have not had a single flower come out intact."
4,A brief review of F.N.G,"I've read 'Chickenhawk', and 'Into the Green' and various other books by Vietnam Vets. This ranks up amongst the best. It is well written (which many aren't) and I believe it is probably autobiographical. It really describes well the day to day grind and general misery of a typical grunt in the field,moving across the complete range of emotion, from watching his buddies getting shot to pieces, to watching his own body gradually disintegrate from the ravages of jungle rot, and eventually..........well just read it!!"
2,Disappointing Christmas Movie,This DVD has several different cartoons on it and I was disappointed in them. They were stressful and characters were mean to each other. Wasn't the nice Christmas movies I was hoping to enjoy with my young kids.
2,unhappy,I was very unhappy with the vhs Mickey's teice upon a christmas. It was labeled as new and I find that very hard to believe. When watching the video the picutes moves up and down the entire movie.
1,Amazon instant video is awful,"The film is great--but the service is AWFUL.Instant video is a terrible app. The buttons are too small, no hdmi out to your own tv and if you must download more than twice (think toddler deletes it, you buy a new iPad, your phone drops into the toilet), you can't without several calls to customer service. Buy it from iTunes. At least then you can download and move it as you wish. By the way, the download is stupidly slow. I tried two systems and wifi on each took a minute per mb. Seriously?"
1,Bad buffering,"The movie was great but it kept ""reloading"". We watched it 2 times but never watched it straight through due multiple ""reloadings"".Seemed like a steaming issue with Amazon as our Netflix & Hulu were working just fine."
5,My son loves this movie!,Who doesn't love Mickey Mouse and his friends?! It definitely is not my son. He absolutely loves this movie. He has watched it twice a day every day since we bought it!
4,Not bad...,Mind you I've only seen part of this as my kids are the primary viewers but the animation is well done and the stories are cute. Does not rank alongside the true Disney classics but good for what it is.
5,Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas DVD,"I saw this DVD in a store while I was doing shopping. Somehow something made me to buy this DVD. I used to watch Mickey Mouse cartoons when I was little and stopped watching them after I watched Transformers, He-Man ... After watching this Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas DVD...hey, I 'm back into the disney world again! This DVD is so cool that not only the kids will love it but even we adults too! I really like all the 3-D effects they made and hope to see more of them. Will there be a Mickey's Thrice Upon a Christmas DVD next year? I'm going to the North Pole to write my name on Santa's good list, hee hee hee..."
2,Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas DVD Review,"The case was in very good condition, but I was disappointed in the DVD disc itself. It was covered in scratches. The quality promised in the description of this item did not hold true."
5,grand daughter agian,but we watched mickey who would let this one slide by we all grew up with mickey mouse what a hoot
3,Just Ok,"I got this for my daughter she loves Mickey, I could care less. I think overall it was just simply ok"
5,Great movie for the under 5 crowd,My son who is 3 loved this movie. It has a good message at the end of each segment and there's plenty of slapstick to keep him laughing.
1,Don't buy unless you enjoy 3D mania.,"What happened to Disney?What a disappointment. It is all about taste yes, some people like certain gimmicks, certain tricks and animations and other people like quality and original art work.Computer animations are not attractive by them selves anymore, they once were (to me)."
2,Lots of bullying,I don't normally write reviews but I disliked this mickey mouse movie so much. Minnie and Daisy bullying each other on the ice rink I was horrified by the the whole first episode on this disk. the other were ok but I really couldn't get over the message that being mean is fine until someone gets hurt. This is not the same Mickey mouse that is on the disney Channel and shouldn't be advertised as such.
4,gift,I bought this for my son he loves anything mickey mouse and he loves this movie too its very cute
4,Great Christmas Movie for the family,"I liked the different stories, but i thought the ones about minnie and daisy and the one about goofy and max could have been longer. my favorite was probably the one with mickey and pluto. but my absolute favorite part of the movie was the different popups that appeared between each story. They were cute and clever."
4,CGI Mickey,"I'm not a huge fan of CGI movies. Shrek's okay and Monsters Inc had it's moments, but I've just never been a huge fan of it. However, I decided to reserve judgement on this one until I saw it. I got it as a gift, so I might as well watch it.It was fairly short (only 68 minutes long). The animation quality may not be up to par with Pixar, but it's still pretty good.The most important thing, beyond the technical animation is whether it's fun or not. I'm surprised to say I actually enjoyed it. The skits were actually entertaining. I haven't really watched Mickey and the gang since I was a kid. It was nice seeing them in action again. And whether your a big fan of CGI or not, it still boils down to entertaining stories that will help get the entire family in the Christmas spirit. It's sure to be a hit with the kids especially, but also the adults."
5,great movie,"Great movie for kids to bring out the Christmas spirit. Recommend to kids of all ages due to the moral of the story, typical Disney."
4,Christmas tradition,"My kids have always loved this. My ten year old still asks to watch this or ""it won't be christmas"" ."
5,GrandChildren Love it,Grand Children love this video Watch it more than once over the holiday season Go ahead and buy it you'll like it
5,kids like it,my kids really like this one. we end up watching it all year lond not just at christmas.
4,Useful little book,"There is a lot of good, constructive information in this concise, well-written book, however as one of the other reviewers mentioned, some of the author's suggestions are questionable from a usability standpoint. Read it, think it over, then do what works for you."
5,"This is the Real Deal, a Must for every Internet Marketer","Amazing book, every page is full of great value content.Maria really gives a lot of great to the point tips to create great web copy that sells!Full with step by step guides, blueprints, simple THE BEST!"
2,The secret every direct response copywriter doesn't want you to know...,"Here it is: You don't have to read their books.Why buy books, when you can get all the direct response copy techniques right from their sales pages? Just like the one that led you here on Amazon.So retrace your steps to [...]Study this sales page. Copy the format, tone and items (such as using teasers ""See page x"" and so forth). Use your own words, of course. While you're at it, visit some sales pages of other direct response copywriters like Seth Godin and Dan Kennedy. See the techniques and patterns emerging?Bottom line, all the lessons are right there.Art"
1,A must for the library of every snake oil salesman,"The Huckster's Handbook -- that's what I call it. If you are in the ""business"" of selling Cialis, coral calcium, weight-loss pills, low interest rate mortgages, shark cartilage, etc., then this book is for you. If, however, you sell legitimate products as I do (coffee) there is little in this book that will be of use to you. It's all about writing hype."
3,Mostly targeted to spammers,"Most of the examples are about writing good copy for websites that promote miracle cures, etc. Same with the email marketing section where you get advice on bypassing spam filters. Otherwise has some good advice that would be useful if it was targeted to more mainstream marketers."
5,sales copy for websites,"""One of the best books I have found that applies direct response copy writing secrets to the Internet. I write direct response a lot for my living and the theory and tactics in this book were spot on"""
4,Good Old English Cozy,"It's been awhile since I read ""Orchestrated Death"" the first book in Ms. Harrod-Eagles Bill Slider series, but I decided to get back in the series. This is the second book in the series, and it's a good one. If you're a fan of English cozies, then give this series a try. Bill Slider is a real doll and his adventures in the fight against crime are good. I really enjoy Ms. Harrod-Eagles writing, and I'm starting to really like her characters - Bill and his sidekick Ahterton (Mr. Perfect). Dixon is wonderful too."
3,Beadwork magazine,"This magazine is good but only average to people who want to use the projects most of the projects are very out there so if that's your thing you will love it. For the average beader it is NOT worth the cover price.Beware the subscription to this magazine if you are not in the US it's overseas subscription is the worst of any magazine I have ever come across, out of 4 issues that I should have had I've had 1 !!!!"
1,Beadwork magazine,"Since I have NOT yet received this magazine, cannot leave a review. If/when it ever arrives, will be glad to post a review."
5,This is a great movie.,I got these movies because I saw them on Lifetime when they came out and they were wonderful movies. I would recommend them to anyone interested in the subject of teen pregnancy and I feel it's gets the message out.Lisa
5,Too Young to be a Dad,"I really liked this movie, mainly because it's told from the teenage father's point of view. About 90% of the TV movies that deal with teen pregnancy are mainly told from the mother's side. This one took a different approach which I thought was a very smart move. Paul Dano was perfectly cast for the roll of Matt Freeman, a straight A honor roll student who sleeps with a girl he likes and she ends up pregnant. Both of their parents decide that adoption is the best option for the baby, but as the movie goes on, Matt has second thoughts. I'm not going to give away the ending, but in my opinion it was a very good ending. This movie is really good for parents to watch with their teenagers since it will (hopefully) send a message that one can end up being pregnant even if you have only had sex once."
5,Mom at Sixteen,"I haven't seen the DVD, but I've watched It on tv twice. its a really touching film. i cant wait until i can buy it...i love this movie so much. it makes me cry but in a good way. fomr watchign the movie ive been a lot happierand chnged my mind about some things. ive dyed my hair to looks like jaceys and im getting a new wardrobe like that in the movie. its a little over the top but i love this movie so much"
5,Too Young To be A Dad,"I recently saw this movie on Lifetime movie network. WOW! This is one of the best movies that have ever seen. This movie shows just what it would be like for a teen if they were to be a parent. I was really surprised about the outcome, and I would explain more, but then you would not have any reason to watch it. This movie showed how to be responsible for your actions, and that you need to think about what you are doing before you do it. If you have ever had this type of situation happen in the family, or are expierencing it right now, I would suggest that you watch this film."
1,Skip this mixer,"I was very excited to receive the Oster 2577 6-Speed Hand Mixer as a gift last December. The retractable cord is a very nice feature. I also like the attachments that came with the mixer. However, those features do not compensate for the major flaw of the mixer. As other reviewers have stated, the speed control is very poorly designed. In fact, I thought the mixer was broken the first time I used it. There are no stirring or blending speeds. The lowest of the six speeds is so fast that I imagine it's near the highest speed on most hand mixers. I really wanted to like the mixer, and so tried it several times throughout the year. Frankly, I now avoid using it. I prefer to pull out my stand mixer, which is not convenient, to trying to control the mess the Oster hand mixer tends to make as it splashes ingredients all over the surrounding counter top."
1,Worst mixer I've ever owned,"I am left wondering if Oster even tested this product. If they had, they never would have released it. Yes, of course its a low price point so you can't expect commercial quality out of it, nor did I expect much. Just mixing cake batter or a few ingredients shouldn't be much to ask though, and this mixer did not deliver. As others have stated, the lowest effective speed of this mixer equates to high on most other mixers. It is zero to zoom in a few seconds, and you're left cleaning up the mess. This is something that can't be overlooked. I wouldn't purchase this mixer if it was available for spare change."
2,Defective product!,"I bought this mixer because the price seemed pretty good, it had a retractable cord, and came with plenty of accessories. However, the first time I used it, I realized that a ""low speed"" does NOT exist on this mixer! Even on the lowest setting, the stuff I was mixing in the bowl went flying all over my kitchen. There seems to be little difference between low and high speeds. My mom happens to own the same one (we bought them around the same time), and hers has the exact same problem. She spoke with Oster on the phone today, and apparently they've had a lot of complaints about this model. They're sending her a replacement. I plan to call them tomorrow to see if they will send me a replacement also.Bottom line, unless you want to lose half of what you're mixing and actually LIKE scrubbing things off the wall, this is NOT the mixer for you!"
1,Speed control??,"I was excited to finally have an electric mixer. This thing is powerful, for sure, but the lowest speed is already going full tilt! If you need to cover yourself and your possessions in flour, have at it. Otherwise, avoid this piece of junk!"
2,Great for high speed; Bad for anything else,"I was excited to order this mixer because of the retractable cord and the strong motor. Unfortunately, though it says it has six speeds those six speeds are actually high, higher, very high, ultra high, extremely high, and most high of all. Though it's great for whipping cream or beating egg white, you cannot mix anything at low or medium speed. At first I thought I could live with it, but I can't. I'm going to buy a different mixer. I do not recommend this to anyone unless you want two mixers also."
2,"easily broken, do not buy","This product looks good but really very fragile. My wife used it only a few times, each time about half hour. And suddenly the shank broke in the middle."
5,Hand Mixer,"I love this mixer. I bought this one to replace one that I had since 1984, it was also an Oster that I received as a wedding gift. I truly hope this one lasts as long as my previous one did. My Aunt had hers since the early 60's, but she didn't use it as much as I used mine."
3,Very Difficult to Eject Beaters,"I have had this hand mixer for over a year and a half and have been quite happy with its mixing capabilities. I've found it to do quite well mixing up cake batters, beating egg whites, mashing potatoes, etc. I have been happy with the retractable cord, the comfort of the handle, etc. I have not used the attachments, however.But, I do not care for this mixer because of how difficult it is to eject the beaters. The eject button is the switch that controls blender speed. It's difficult to push in, even for my husband. I learned quickly not to eject the beaters unless the mixer is unplugged, because if it's being especially difficult, your thumb may slip and inadvertently turn on the mixer!The mixer performs well enough for me to continue to use it. However, I would never recommend this mixer for someone to purchase because of how difficult it is to eject the beaters."
2,What a disappointment !,"I had owned another Oster Hand Mixer for years but the motor finally died. So I ordered this one without reading the reviews. What a disappointment. It is heavy for long use, it is too fast and splatters stuff all over and the beaters are hard to remove. Oh, and the retractable cord is cranky and doesn't always work. I'm looking for a new mixer...any suggestions?"
1,Poor Engineering!,"I purchased this mixer at a Meijer store for $30. It's going back for a refund today, and I haven't even bothered to turn it on to try it. After reading the reviews on this product, I'm truly puzzled as to why this problem hasn't been mentioned yet: it's too heavy and thick for a hand mixer. I'm average height, and so is my countertop. Yet I have to hold this mixer up high to use, and it's awkward. It's also quite heavy, which normally would seem an impressive feature for a product field filled with cheap and junky items. But in this case, it makes it less functional. I can't even imagine using this for more than a few minutes. It might work for a tall guy in a workshop, but for the average female with less upper body strength and height, it's not practical. Worst hand mixer I've ever tried!"
3,high speed mixer,"Great if you want to beat things at a high rate speed which is why I purchased this one *WARNING THERE IS NO LO SPEED* I have another 125 watt blender that I now use for liquid so it dosen't spray all over! I puchased this one because I couldnt find a 250 watt blender for this price!! I don't find the cord to be short same size as my other blender however it is slighty difficult to press the release button for the beaters, but you can just pull them out shouldnt break anything I was doing it that way to my old blender for the last 15 years (never knew there was a release button)Overall if you want a powerful blender for a great price and your willing to be a very careful with liquid (or you have a less powerful blender) this is it! Go buy it!CHANGE OF REVIEW before buying this one check out the oster 2500 sounds like its pretty good and it has a lower speed that works!"
2,Too Scary,"I bought it at Target for about $40. I wasn't sure about it because of the price and that it was so heavy. I was attracted to the 6 speeds and the retractable cord. That retracting feature is nice but it's a stop and start process with some fiddling with the cord to get the job done. The beaters are thin and I didn't read about the care for them, so I either left them in water overnight or put them in the dishwasher. The next day they were rusted and I had only used the mixer one or two times. The great thing is that they have a good customer service department and I was able to have them replaced. A good point someone made for making cookies, was that this would be a good machine for that. The other comments about the high speed and control of contents being mixed are also true. Noise level: it probably isn't any louder than the other hand mixers. This is my 2nd or 3rd mixer in 23 years. I'd like to either upgrade to a stand-up mixer or find the G.E. model I had before."
1,Stopped working after 10 minutes,"I agree with the other's comments on lousy speed control. Mine burnt out, literally, after 10 minutes of use. Mixing softened cream cheese, on low. Complete junk. Is there a ""No Star""?"
2,Injured hand,"I let my daughter use this mixer with the whisk attachment to beat some egg whites and one of the wires broke off during mixing and jabbed her in the hand. I never used the whisk for anything but whipping cream and egg whites, but apparently it wasn't sturdy enough for that. When I called customer service, the person was very nice and said they'd send me another mixer, but when it arrived, it was a different brand, one that I had decided I didn't like the look and feel of when I was shopping originally. It also had only one set of beaters instead of the various attachments of the Oster mixer, the box was smashed, and the whole thing smelled of burnt motor. At this point I think I want my money back so I can try a mixer from a whole different company.Before it broke, it worked pretty well, but the retractable cord only retracted a couple times before it stopped doing so, and all the speeds were very fast. I had to use an extra large bowl to keep ingredients from spraying everywhere."
1,"beaters flaking off, no low setting","There seems to be some sort of coating or metallic paint on these beaters that flakes off in the food! That can't be good. What are those things made of? It is also too powerful... there is no low speed. Even just set on 1, it goes way too fast. I can't let my children use this without hanging on to it with them. There are times I feel I could lose control of it, not to mention it flings the food all over the place."
1,Terrible Mixer,"Don't waste your money on this one. No speed control, too heavy for me, cord wouldn't retract, and beaters were hard to eject."
1,I've replaced it,Same complaint as others. I've ended up with spatters and flour dust all over so I'm afraid to try anything higher than the lowest speed. The retractable cord was a great selling point for me. Too bad it doesn't work well. I have to feed it in a few inches at a time. When the cord is extended it's so curled it gets in the way and makes the appliance difficult to use. I've only had this mixer a year and I've replaced it.
1,It cannot be used in the UK. Why on earth to you allow products to be purchased from the US if you can't use them in the UK!!!!,I am furious! I want all my money back and postage!!!!!!! NOW OK!!!!! I am deeply ashamed of the poor standard.
2,Should have paid attention to other reviews,"This mixer looks and feels like a good quality mixer, however, the lowest speed is much too powerful. There is no way you can slowly mix in any ingredient without splattering all over the place as the lowest speed is extremely fast. I can only imagine what the other speeds must be like. I also think the mixer is too bulky. I have large hands and I find it much too awkward to handle. The retractable cord does not always work. You have to play with it to make it retract. Would not recommend this mixer due to it's bulky size and the fact that the lowest speed is way too powerful.I would return it but I have gone beyond my 30 days."
1,WAY too powerful to be useful,"This looks good, but even on the lowest speed it's too powerful. And there's little variation from low to high. It's also a bit big and much heavier than my last hand mixer. Definitely NOT the right mixer for me. And unless you want butter and sugar or eggs splattering your kitchen walls, you, too, are better off with a different model."
1,No speed control,"I found my mixer to have the same problem that the other reviewers addressed. 6 different speed selections, but there's practically no difference between low speed and high speed -- more accurately, there really isn't a low speed. Very bad situation when you try to mix dry ingredients into wet. Flour goes everywhere.Additionally, it could be more streamlined than it is. It's too tall (distance from handle to tip of beaters) for me, an ergonomic problem. To save my shoulders I either need to get a new mixer, or lower my countertops.Last comment: the retractable cord feature doesn't work well. I have to keep pushing the button and forcing the cord to rewind.For me, this was one wasted purchase."
1,awful,"since I dont have my receipt I'm writing a review on amazon to take out frustration.My complaint is the same as the others - the speed control.I got this mixer as an affordable stopgap since my stand up mixer is broken. I bake often, and every time I use this mixer, I want to kick myself for not returning this the night I bought it.The minimum speed is ridiculously high, makes for messy mixing and useless for some items altogether (eg brownies, muffins)don't make the same mistake I did!"
1,no slow speed,"I thought that the newer model had the problem corrected, but there is no low speed on this hand held mixer.Too late for me to return it, since I don't have the box anymore."
3,Rather fast read,"Reads like a cross between a travelogue and novel. Good attention to detail. A touch of Brazilian history and insights into its polyglot denizens and the rise of the plutocrats, juxtaposed with the country's migrant poor.I'd give it 3 and a half stars if that were possible"
5,Why isn't this is print?,"Truly a great book on the by-gone era of airships. Copiously illustrated, ""The Hindenburg - An Illustrated History"" teaches the reader not only about the one airship that everyone remembers, but also about airships in general.Count Zeppelin was the grandfather of the Hindenburg, but other designers are chronicled here. Germany, England, and the US all have their airship histories summarized.The paintings bring to life an age that will never come again . . . when the airship ruled the skies.Look for this book in auctions if you have any interest in airships."
3,Beautiful Illustrations but poor historical context,"The book is as impressive as other reviewers have indicated. Beautifully illustrated and a virtually complete history of the development of the type. The comprehensive illustrations (and it IS an illustrated history) leave little room for developing the text so although the history of the airship and its place in geopolitics and history is correctly portrayed there is virtually no reference to the true reason for the demise of airships - the succesful development of cheaper, faster heavier than air aircraft that (usually!) delivered their cargos more reliably and on time. None the less the book IS a good illustration source and provides sufficient pointers for further detailed research."
5,"WAIT!, NO! I DO RETRACT MY LAST REVIEW!","What am I doing? I can't make up my mind - some days I like it some days I don't. Today I weighed less, so I guess it's a good book. And don't foget to look at my picture on the back cover - I've never looked that good! I really do owe it all to Muscle Meals. Just forget what I said before."
3,"Use the book to gain muscle, not loose fat","If you can get past the goofy, narcistic illustrations in the book, the majority of the recipies are fairly good. However, it will help to know your way around the kitchen as some of the recipies need tinkering to make them either work or taste acceptable. Doubling up of some recipies (i.e. one with protien powder, one without)gives the impression that there are more recipies here than there really are. An average to good cookbook for serious bodybuilders trying to add muscle but are tired of the replacement meal in a blender routine. Would not recommend the book for someone who is looking to only loose weight. The nutritional information given is for large servings."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"Most recipes in the book start with good intentions and a few are actually good, but most lack flavor and the textures are off. This book would be good for someone just getting into a nutrition program, or someone who needed a great deal of guidance. I was disappointed with this book."
1,VERY BAD BOOK,"I bought this book because of a few positive reviews. I guess I should've noticed that they were all posted on the same day with similar wording. Very suspicious, but they can't cover up for a bad book. This is absolutely the worst diet book I've ever read. Poorly executed with lousy food."
2,Disappointing,As much as I tried this book just didn't work for me. I feel there are many better diet/exercise books on the market that will give you much more for your money.
2,Confusing science book,"I wanted to like this book, but I found the science and diet advice confusing and contradictory."
1,Simply gross recipes,"I had very high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, most of the recipes were pretty gross. Most are pretty bland. This book just collects dust now."
1,horrible,this book was a complete waste of money. the recipes are disgusting. I've made several of them and ended up throwing everything out. the book is next. save your money.
1,POORLY WRITTEN WITH BAD RECIPIES,"This book is filled with bland, un-appetizing ""food."" I want to be kind, but following this book's advice I gained six pounds of fat in 2 months and I was hungry for real food all the time."
1,VERY BAD,"This book is amateurish. The photography is bad, the writing is worse, and the meals are very unappetizing. I tried cooking a half dozen meals from this book and all but one of them (liver and oatmeal, surpisingly) were bland. I don't know how else to put it. I liked the liver and oatmeal, iron-boosting breakfast. I just had it for my last meal. But I know most people will not find that appealing. This was a good idea for a book; the execution is the only problem."
4,"Great pictures, flawed layout","I bought this book years ago when it was first released and was disappointed to see that many pictures are printed over 2 pages which means the fold is cutting the beautiful pictures in two. Also, these pictures look so much better when presented on a white background, why on earth did they use black?The pictures themselves are of course the best railroad pictures ever taken and print quality is superb!"
4,In the best tradition of Connelly and Sjowall and Wahloo,"Charlie Resnick is inspector in Nottingham, where the 6 year old girl Gloria disappears. After a few months her body is found by a young couple making love in an abandoned warehouse. A few months later another 6 year old girl, Emily, disappears. At first sight the disappearances look very similar and there are quite a few possible suspects. It is up to Resnick and his team to sort out who was involved in what. In the end both crimes are solved, but it takes until the last page before it becomes clear to the reader what happened exactly.Charlie Resnick is an inspector in the tradition of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch including his love for jazz music. We also follow Resnick's colleagues, who are not all equally likeable, but that only makes the characters more realistic. There is also quite a lot of criticism on society in the tradition of Sjöwall and Wahlöö. All in all this book is a very enjoyable read."
5,Straigth terminal Rerailer,"Straigth terminal Rerailer, turn out that this will be used as a spare. The train set already has a rerailer in it's track package."
1,Fake memorys pro duo been sold in Amazon,"I'm totally dissapointed, i bought two Sony MSXM8GS 8 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo (Retail Package)from two different sellers, and they are fake totally fake, i wrote to the sellers and they said that they can't do anithing about, this is so bad, that this people be allowed to sell in Amazon, since they are fooling people, and taking our money just that easy, i tought that since was Amazon, this things would not happen, i was wrong, now i'm afraid to buy any other thing, cause i don't know if i'm going to get what i bought.....Dennis Saranovitz"
4,8 Gigs is a lot of stuff,"Verrryyy Niiiccee as Borat would say, this product rocks. 8 gigs is huge for a PSP or digital camera. I use mine for my PSP and I have 3 movies, about 250 songs, 1000 pictures, every demo game made and all of my game saves and downloaded content on the stick! It is excellent, however it is not quite as fast as my old 4 Gig Sandisk card, but you really only notice when opening the videos folder and while transferring from a PC. It is still fairly quick and I definitely recommend getting one if $200 sounds like a good deal to you!"
4,Good for PSP storage,"I bought this for a PSP console. I wanted to store music, pics and games. I've been using it for more than a year and so far, it hasn't let me down.Now that the newest PSP models don't have a UMD reader, a memory stick this big will be much more useful."
4,fake but great,arrival time was great product is great but yes....it is fake but works perfectly fine on most (older) products and i haven't ran into any problems with new things either but have seen a lot of bad reviews about it so if u want to take the chance if it works with your hardware its worth the price if it does (works great with psp)
5,Awesome product for my modded psp slim,"Works flawlessly with my psp iso's. Fast data transfer rates and solid reliability. 100% legitimate stick, definitely recommended."
1,It was a counterfeit,"I was sent a counterfeit 8GB memory stick. It showed 8GB of memory, but only 500MB of it worked. Everything that was stored on over that was corrupted. I filed a claim with Amazon and got my money back. Don't buy from the Gadget Store."
1,Terrible Service,"I bought this product some time ago, and the seller sent me the wrong product. So I emailed the seller and sent my product back. Now the seller stops responding to my emails. So I file a claim with Amazon. Amazon denies my claim. So here I am out roughly $30 and nothing to show for it.plain and simple I wouldn't risk purchasing from this seller"
2,Not too sure about this one,"First of all, this came all the way from Hong Kong. It took way too long for it to get here. It took about 2-4 weeks just for it to arrive. Second, it does not look authentic. The packaging was a cheap plastic not like one you find at a regular store. I can't say if it works or not because it was not for me. Go with the Amazon for quick shipping and true Sony product."
5,very very good,The seller and the product were excellent I will definitely buy from them again.Thank You
1,JUNK,"dont buy this 8 gb memory stick ! at least not from these people, was no good and i could not get them to return my e-mail's so i threw the piece of crap in the trash ! i gave about 80 or 90 bucks for it , i think alot of people are coming over to amazon.com with ther junk from e-bay i would never buy anything from e-bay again because we have got burnt there several times now it seems like the same song and dance here !oh and no help from sony either even tho it was a brand new sony card."
3,"Good, but expensive.","The product is good, do what is expected, but considering its price is better buying 2 cards of 4G."
3,slow shipping from amazon,"normally fast shipping from amazon but this item did not arrive by the stated time, and I had to leave on vacation; so I never did get to try it.In other words, if you're expecting to receive it by a certain date and it's critical that you have it, don't order from here. go out and buy in an electronics store for twenty bucks more."
1,Bad vendor do not buy from them.,"Order two (2) unit, they charge me two (2) unit and shipping and handling for two (2) but only shipping 1 unit. What a drip off they are. I got con......The adaptor for memory stick pro due is broke a part, not sure this is a real product make by SONY.......shiping come from Hong Kong take 4 week to get it....""SH.T"" ""SH.T"""
5,Huge amount of space,"Using it in my psp. I put half of californication se1, the first four eps of the office and five movies and I still got room on it. Reads just fine in my psp and transfers just as fast as my sandisk 4 gig card. Without the movies I can put about 23 psp isos and a couple of homebrew games and apps... The isos range from a couple hundred megs to about 1.3 gigs. Anyways it holds a lot of stuff and it works in my psp. That's all I need."
3,not a sony authentic,"aside from this not being an authentic sony merchandise (which by the way the seller failed to mention until AFTER purchase) i have no problems using it on my psp. the delivery was fast and i didn't notice the speed difference on transfering files, i'm not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing. but nonetheless, i am much happier with my psp now that i have multiple games to choose from the memory stick"
5,Best memory stick for the psp!!!,"Okay, the Sony 8GB memory stick (MSX-M8GS) is fantastic, period. It not only works on the PSP, but on anything that uses Pro Duo, which includes cameras and so forth. It even comes with an adapter for devices that use the old Duo sticks.What can you do with 8GB? Well you can hold a bunch of music files, photos, movies. I can watch whole seasons of my favorite shows, no joke. I had watched all of victory Gundam and still had enough room for more, and victory Gundam has around 30 episodes. Imagine watching all of the first season of heroes on your psp without changing sticks, sweet no?I would only recommend this to anyone who feels that a two and four gig memory stick is two small or someone who wants a whole season of a tv show on their psp. A bit pricey, but well worth it."
2,has its funny parts but...,i can pinpoint the problem with this movie. It starts out pretty good and is pretty funny but somewhere along the line whoever wrote this movie realized that the plot is too short for a full movie. They aded so many subplots that the movie becomes completly ruined. By the end of the movie so much more had happened then just what was supposed to in the begining that you lose track and the funny parts stop. this movie gets a + for effort
4,Myst V: End of Ages Limited Edition (Mac),I enjoy these types of games. Certain preferances are not compatible with my imac G5. There is a conflict with the video card which causes they system to crash. I had to turn off antialiasing and something else. It worked fine after that.
3,First Impressions,"Big dissappointment. Beware, this item is more hype than reality. The strategy guide is a miniature, only about 3""x5"" with a font that only Lilliputians can read. Can't comment on gameplay since I just got it yesteday. The making of video is at the mystworlds website. From what I ahve read it should be top notch.The music and lithograph are a definite bonus."
2,Beware the Soundtrack in the Mac Special Edition Myst V,"Just bought the Myst V Special Edition for Mac. Haven't started the game -- but I did listen to the soundtrack. The soundtrack is amazingly boring! Any amatuer with a Mac and Garageband could have composed and orchestrated a better score/soundtrack. Myst V soundtrack is totally unlike the other Myst soundtracks (I have them all and love them) -- it is uninspired, mindless, unimaginatively synthesized, with barely a connection to the themes woven throughout the music to Myst, Riven, Myst III, and even Myst IV. Even the singers sound bored silly.I hope the soundtrack doesn't foretell an equally boring gaming experience. Mac users -- wait to purchase the game alone."
3,Not great but play it anyway!,"Ok, ok, I agree with the other reviewers that this one was not as good as the others, but hey, it's the last one and we all knew it. If they had ended the series without telling us with Myst IV we'd also be equally upset, right?So, it's an ok experience. Not nearly as challenging as IV, not nearly as exciting as Riven, not nearly as experiential as III, but it's ok. If you've played all the others I feel you owe it to yourself to play this one, but it won't be one that you'll be talking about for months or years to come! Hey, you can do like I did and turn around a sell it here on Amazon when you're done, but at least play it!!!"
3,Inferior singers and over-calculated conducting,"I admire some of Boulez's Mahler recordings, but in this case his cool, analytical approach sinks Mahler's greatest romantic work. To remain aloof in Das Lied is as lethal as remaining aloof in Tristan or Parsifal. Mahler invites us into a world that Boulez dissects from afar.His tenor soloist plainly has half the voice needed, and although Violetta Urmana is an exciting Russian newcomer (originally Lithuanian), her grasp of Mahler style falls far short of Jaent Baker, Kathleen Ferrier, and Christa Ludwig, whose recordings of Das Lied are glories of the record catalog. At bsst, Boulez offers an intriguing alternative, for those who don't want Mahler to be too exciting."
4,The BEST dream book for content!,"This book has the most information for understanding the threads that weave through our dreams. It is a little hard to find specific references until after you see the whole book to become familiar with the author's groupings.(no index). However, the search is MORE than worth the effort. The explainations of dream-states and angelic realms are not often found in other sources. If you dream, this should be in your personal library!"
1,Not good,"Read that this is the best book on dreams. But after reading many others, I do not have a good rating for it. It interprets dreams with stuff in the bible. I am a Hindu, what happens then? Read ""The Complete dream book"" by Holloway. It is way better."
5,Watch Your Dreams,"Without question this book by Ann Colton is provocative in a good way, and has been very helpful to me. Amazingly enough, I have had dreams that have coincided with what she has described in her book ""Watch Your Dreams""."
4,Still See Fleas,"I just received this item in the mail yesterday, May 3rd 2012, and used it the same night, spraying the entire house with the exception of the one room that's off limits to Lila, my cat (pending permission to spray it, which I have now received, with limits). However, early this morning, several hours after spraying and thus plenty after the spray had dried, I was bit by a few fleas - and they normally don't bite me, just land on me awaiting my swiping palms. Furthermore, somehow I seem to have gotten the spray itself all over me, so I took a bath in which I washed myself thoroughly with soap and water, and washed my hair with shampoo, but my skin is still extremely all-over itchy today.Hopefully, my expectations that the spray will kill the fleas will hold out. I know it's too soon to really judge the effectiveness of the product yet, as it hasn't really had time to work. Therefore, I will attempt to remember to update this review as necessary, but no guarantees."
3,Good Product - Terrible Sprayer!!!,"The product seems to do the job....the problem is the sprayer. It leaks a lot! Ended up with more product on our hands and dripping around on the floor than we had to spray. And it says not to get this stuff on your hands - then put a sprayer on it that works!!!! Finally retro fitted a sprayer from a different bottle and it seems to do much better! But really, should a person have to do this???? Sentry Home needs to redesign the sprayer so it does not leak all over. If I buy this again, we will use a different sprayer right off the bat and not have the mess we had the first time we used it...."
3,Not entirely without merit,"There is a lot of action in ""The One Eyed Soldiers"", an obscure but enjoyable European spy movie, but very little sense. In fact, none at all. It is like someone had a bare outline for a potentially interesting thriller but neglected to fill in any of the connecting dots."
5,the best book in every universe,"Little Molly is sick, and Hank, Drover, and Slim try to bring her medicine.But they get lost in a blizzard!Will they ever make it back home?Will they get the medicine to the baby?Find out in this exciting adventure of hank the cowdog!!!!!!!"
5,The Greatest Hockey Movie Ever Made,"In perhaps what is the finest example of hockey ever captured on film, this documentary follows the New Jersey Devils through their drive to the Stanley Cup in 1995. Film has many highlights of the Devils' playoff series against Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and then the Detroit Red Wings for hockey's most coveted prize the Stanley Cup. There are also many off ice interviews with players, coaches, fans and others that will give the viewer a few interesting side notes. This movie is a true classic in its depiction of the underdog Devils coming through the playoff series and sweeping the heavily favored Red Wings in the Finals. This film is a great piece of hockey history. Well done movie, as with most good movies, look for many more sequels to be released in the coming years."
3,hard 2 get a feel for.,It was diffcult 2get time period & where it took place. & I have 2 write a papr by 3-3-99 please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,i didnt really like it.,I think that if you are into literature than you might like this book but I think that it wasnt as great as my professor said it was going to be
4,Replacement Remington Foils & Cutters,"I don't feel like these are as good as the original...I'm sorry. I admit I was a bit disappointed.Tried a couple of new razors out there that shaved much better than this and I probably will just buy a new razor next time. Seller's service & shipping was great, though...would definitely buy from this seller again."
3,bubbling,I'm sure I could improve upon my installation but in the end the bubbling was just obnoxious - I'm tempted to remove and try again but instead I wrote this review.
2,Old and Cheesy,"You would think that the nhl would be able to put out something better than this piece or work. The ""hosts"" are corny and their segments are worthless. The goals themselves are pretty good, but the most recent only go up to about 1995. So don't expect any of the recent great goals that have been scored in the NHL. Overall I would only recommend this product to fans who have followed hockey for 15 or 20 years."
3,Obscure,"While the introduction and footnotes were very well edited, I did struggle through the actual journals themselves. This could be attributed to Nelson's writing style, my unfamiliarity with Lake Superior geography and/or the plethora of French nomenclature (which can generate confusion for some). Overall, the journals are insightful of survival strategies and day to day existence in the fur trade years of 1802-04 in northern Wisconsin. Nelson, who was only fifteen when joining the XY Company, was a keen observer of Ojibwa Indian customs, the interrelationships between company men and his immediate surroundings. If the writing of the journals had more continuity, it would have been an enjoyable read."
2,Bad Narrating,I was very disappointed in the Andes: Machu Picchu DVD. They played awful flute music throughout the video and it was not a good tour of the area.
3,microwave egg poacher leaves much to be desired,"Maybe I expected too much but this thing is so hard to clean and it must be CLEAN each time you use it. I don't know why but when we try to use it twice in a row without cleaning it perfectly, it does not cook the eggs well the second time around. Eggs are pretty tricky to clean off in general so maybe I shouldn't blame the plastic device, but it is truly annoying to have to spend 5 minutes scrubbing this thing after easch use. It was very inexpensive so for the money I suppose it is fine."
1,Not a good cooker,This plastic microwave cooking device does a horrible job of making poached eggs. It gets the egg too done.
3,microwave egg poacher,"I had high hopes for this, but was disappointed. It blows up and splatters the oven part of the time. I try to make sure to prick the yolk and that the lid is on correctly but it still only works part of the time."
1,A real pain,"I bought one of these, and followed the directions as closely as I could, cooking the 2 eggs at 1:15 minutes. The result was two overcooked eggs. The next time I looked for the wattage of my mircowave and adjusted the cooking time to 1:00 minute. This time one egg was undercooked, and the other exploded all over the inside of the microwave."
2,If you like exploding eggs and cleaning your microwave.....,"If you do like exploding eggs and cleaning your microwave every time then this is for you. I have tried it several times and adjusted the time but the eggs are either over cooked or under cooked. This last time I placed a heavy coffe cup on top because I am tired of cleaning my microwave. The concept is great since I have no time to boil water and wait. The lid needs to be better so it stays shut regardless of what is going on inside! Yes, I pricked the eggs, added a tablespoon of water and BAAMMMM - explode city! Thank goodness it does not cost much."
