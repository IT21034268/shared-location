5,Finally!,"I am so stoked to see the Wild Swans reissued on cd. I've been searching for this one for a long time. Before buying this I had only heard Bible Dreams and Young Manhood on those Sire Records ""Just Say..."" samplers. Just on the merit of those two songs I was sparked to locate this cd. And it was well worth the search. This is an awesome set of songs. From start to finish it's pure delight. Lush guitars woven with subtle keyboards and the guy's cool voice makes this an all time favorite for me. You won't be sorry."
5,Nearly perfect,"This album is a near perfect blend of pensive lyrics, lush guitars, fantastic keyboards, and great vocals. It is well deserving of its 5 out of 5 review average. I highly recommend it for anyone who appreciates bands like New Order, The Ocean Blue, U2, The Cure, Toad the Wet Sprocket, etc."
5,Wrath of God..The Dragon Wasp,"Mr. Bennett has shown a unique and original style of writing. The story blends different worlds and moves smoothly from one to another. I believe the use of wasps and their superior attack modes bring the reader into suspenseful situations that appear to be hopeless for the people being attacked. Mr. Bennett changes scenarios with combinations of opposing worlds that rely on medieval contests to the death.Throughout, he weaves a medical struggle to discover ways to avert the effects of the Dragon Wasp. This book could easily be adapted to a movie."
3,"Okay read, doubts on that Booker nomination though","The book sets out to be impressive but along the way it somehow disappoints. The plot seems to drag on endlessly with the characters continously sulking and mulling over their problems! All in all, it is still enjoyable as a light read with little depth and character development."
1,A Booker Prize nominee???,I usually wouldn't write but felt compelled to say that this book is awful. Definately not serious literature - must have been a very weak year in the Commonwealth!
3,Missing in Action,The story had no plot at all. A very simple story told in even simpler way! I was not very impressed. I didnt feel author did a great job in catching emotions that revolved around the theme. Probably only good thing about the book is the parellism with real life.
5,Great for Runners with a neutral footstrike!,"This is my second pair of Grid Trigon 4 Ride shoes. I used my last pair at the Surf City USA Half-Marathon, for running and preparing for the Los Angeles Marathon and for training for the upcoming Long Beach marathon. They were very comfortable and have given me generous support. Just don't train in the rain, the shoes are not as comfortable to use when they are soaked in water. My last pair zonked out losing some of it's protective cushioning properties after nine months of use, and I really wanted to get the same pair. :-)"
3,If you have an old microwave - this is the only one out there!,"No...it's not great. Ball bearings were falling out all over the place. Amazingly enough, it still works!? It's the same piece of junk it was years ago...but...if you don't want to replace a microwave because of a lack of a turntable, it's the only way to go."
5,Highly recommended for either California history or women's issues libraries,"No Rooms of Their Own: Women Writers of Early California, 1849-1869 offers a fine collection of literary writings from fifteen women who wrote in diaries and were decades ahead in their feminist thoughts. Liberated from usual roles in a frontier world, their essays, poems, and stories describe their challenges and make for inspirational reading highly recommended for either California history or women's issues libraries."
2,Watch the part number,"I have an R717 camera. I bought the dock too. Each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical. HP labels both as an R07 battery but the L1812A has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera. The other battery is the L1812B and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera. I bought a ""clone"" battery (not HP) and its edges are rounded too. Maybe HP could explain the difference. Just thought you would like to know."
2,Good product; bad experience on delivery,"Product shipped when ordered, and USPS indicated it was delivered 3 days later. Finally, the product arrived via USPS 20 days after the original delivery indication date.... USE ANOTHER METHOD OF DELIVERY!"
4,HP L1812A Battery for my Digital Camera HP R707,"Actually, there is nothing much to review except to say that the product arrived in a condition that I expected. It is just a rechargeable camera battery."
5,great level,"this is the first Stabila level that i have owned, and it is everything it says it to be. Easy to read, strong magnets, and TOUGH! I am a welder, so my tools ride in the toolbox and need to take care of themselves over rough ground down the pipeline right of way, this level does it all"
4,fun for a while but collects dust,it's fun cute toy to have and play with once in a while. My apartment gets very dusty from heavy constructing works in the vecinity and the dust doesn't forgive this toy. So you can clean the accessories but you can't really clean the sand. So you mix it up and eventually the sands went from very light to greyish. I suppose I could just buy a bag of sand and clean this one out.
5,Love my little sand box!,I have always wanted an item like this. I've seen many sandboxes similar to this one at the mall & finally I just bought one online. It's even a little bigger than I thought! I LOVE my little sandbox. It's nice to just play in the sand sometimes.
2,junk jewelry,"I am very unhappy with this product. I have only been wearing it for a couple of weeks and all the ""silver"" has rubbed off the skull that hangs down and the ring that holds the hanging skull is not welded together so it gets snagged on things like towels and such. I would not buy another from this vendor and am going to try to get my money back."
5,Fabulous and hard-to-find item,"This is a fabulous item for anyone who loves steaming food. It is also extremely rare - you can find hundreds of ""large"" steamers (more than about 12"" in diameter), but this is the only one that is small (7.5"" in diameter)... ideal for people with small kitchens/cabinets that wouldn't normally accommodate the large steamers. And I haven't been able to find this item anywhere else."
2,Not quite like the old Revere Ware,"I bought this steamer insert to mate with my 1979 3qt Revere Ware sauce pan. Theoretically, they should be the same design. I realize the new Revere Ware is now made in Indonesia and China and that the quality of the stainless steel isn't as high as it used to be; however, I expected that the steamer insert should fit. It did not. It fit very loosely and wasn't even staying on properly. There are small gaps between the steamer insert and the pan that would let a lot of steam escape. I ended up finding an old Made in USA one at the Salvation Army for $5. Gently used and 90% new. Fit like a glove. Nice and tight. I compared the two and there's no comparison in the machining. This new one is just going to become a spare!"
4,"Adhesive on bottom of pan, near impossible to get off","I love the steamer, don't get me wrong. But whomever came up with the type of adhesive that holds the label on the entire bottom used something near impossible to remove before using the pan. Heat does not remove it, soap does not remove it, steam does not remove it, a scouring pad does not remove it, what removes it? I have yet to discover so I have yet to used this steamer."
4,Pretty nice steamer basket,"This steamer basket gets used about twice daily in my house, for steaming veggies and fish and hard-cooked eggs (try it, they're much easier to peel than boiled eggs, even when the eggs are fresh). It holds the steam fairly well, but enough steam escapes from the so that at 15 minutes (the time to steam eggs) the water in a 2-quart pan is nearly dry. I suspect this is a problem with the lid rather than the steamer basket, as the lid was part of the saucepan set and does not come with the steamer. I'm ordering the 3-quart pan to avoid the dry-up problem instead as a result.The handle is what really makes the steamer for me - it's so nice to be able to pick it up from the water pan and walk to wherever I need to without burning my fingers on the ring in a traditional folding steamer basket."
3,Obnoxious label on bottom of steamer,I love RevereWare and would give product this 5 stars except for a VERY stuck-on label that covers the entire bottom of the steamer.
3,"This video should be titled, ""Cold War Presidents""","The video, ""American Presidents""'s name is misleading. Although contained in the title is Presidents, it is nothing more than a history of the Cold War Presidents. So after we get by that, the video is informative, accurate and interesting. The video clips are relavent, and worthwhile. I showed this video to my 4th grade social studies class and they were able to understand its content and manage not to fall asleep."
3,stuff reading,"The meat of the story was great and I did enjoy the read. A true love story, the guy gets the girl at the end... but It was the getting there that was the issue.There seemed to be much repetition throughout the book and there wasn't a nice flow to the story either. I didn't know who the author was talking about at times until later on the character would ""pop-up"" again finally clarifying who he/she was.Maybe it takes a second read?"
4,Great book,"Two troubled souls find one another and help each other mend painful pasts. I read this in one sitting. Victoria the heroine was wonderful candid and intellegent, Gabriel was dark,brooding but also loving and kind. This is the first book I've read from this author,and I must say I was very impressed, it was a sweet sexy read with a great plot that I refuse to go into, do yourself a favor and read it yourself."
4,A worthy change of pace....,"I don't think that I can put my finger on anything that caused me to be totally swept away by this story, but I was. Gabriel's Woman is the first Robin Schone book that I have read and am planning now to work backwards and read The Lover to find out more about Michael. The writing style is a bit different but I was able to adjust to it quickly.I disagree with the reviewers who say that this book is too dark and has too much homosexual innuendo. I believe that it was written exactly as it needed to be. Gabriel's life was not pretty and light, therefore should not have been sugar-coated and wrapped in a bow as many other romances would have it. I do enjoy the more typical romances as well but this was an exciting change of pace.My opinion is that if you are open-minded and would like to add something to your romance collection, clear you schedule and dive into this book."
3,The only love story is between Michael & Gabriel,"This dark story is about Gabriel who we met in The Lover and Victoria, who is another virgin who needs sex tutoring. Gabriel is the typical schone hero. He is a tortured hero who was a victim of homosexuals. Though wonderfully written, i didn't find it erotic at all. Sure, the sex scenes are kinky but it lacks warmth and tenderness. The only love story here is between Michael and Gabriel - they are too close for comfort. I got the impression that the feelings they have for each is other is more than friendship if you know what i mean(almost like a homosexual bond). But Schone is a good writer that's why i gave it 3 stars."
2,"CLINICAL, NOT EROTIC",Great writing but the author portrays sex as cold and clinical. Maybe because the characters are not warm individuals. I agree with one reviewer below that Robin Schone is good at character development but sorely lacks in eroticism. The sex scenes doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy all over. It's mostly clinical descriptions of sex and the male and female anatomy. The publisher again misleads the readers by selling this as erotic romance. There's nothing erotic about it at all.
2,Save your money.,"There is absolutely no chemistry or heat between these two characters. The hero and heroine spent minimal time together, and I don't think they even kissed more than twice. I understand this book is labeled ""erotic"", but I felt that it was a very weak love story."
2,Wrong relationship,"This book is not a love story. The most intense relationship is the one between Gabriel and ""the second man."" There's been mention of homosexual overtones - I think that is a bit overstated...the real story is not between our lovers, but how much hate and fear Gabriel has that needs to be overcome before he can love again. Frankly, there was little heat between the two main characters, I don't think they even kissed before page 200. If you want to read a great book of Robin Schone's, skip this and read The Lady's Tutor,"
1,Bad,I have had very few books that I couldn't get though but I have read 75 pages and can't go on. Doesn't make sense. Don't have any idea where the author is going and not going to waste any more of my time. Sorry I paid good money for this.
3,WIERD AND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT . . .,"and if that's what you're looking for go for it. Explicit sex scenes and confusing writing make this sequel a stilted read.The book is a sequel to another book (The Lover) which I have yet to read and the writer makes no effort to cover what happened in the first book to clarify what is happening in the second! Besides being confusing (and the writing style attempts to be poetically vague!) the sex is also quite shocking. I haven't ever read a description of sodomy in romance writing but this one has it in all the detail you could want. The only other book by Schone I have read is ""The Lady's Tutor"" which was a much better read."
1,Great customer service but awful book,"The customer service was fantastic from the seller, but this book is thrash, and after the first 3 chapters, I threw it away. The author must have been on something when he/she wrote it. Don't waste your money."
4,A NOVEL OF EROTIC ROMANCE,"I have read all of Robin Schone's books and this one, like ""The Lover"" and ""The Lady's Tutor"" was hard to put down. This book continues where ""The Lover"" left off, only this is the story of Gabriel and Victoria Chambers. In this story, Victoria, a 34 year old former governess, appears at newly reopened House of Gabriel to sell herself to the higest bidder. We later find out that Victoria is the unknowning pawn of the plan to destroy Gabriel. While there is graphic sexual content, I throughly enjoyed this book. If you liked ""The Lover"" and ""The Lady's Tutor"" you MUST read Gabriel's Woman"
2,Hard to Read,"I love reading about broken heroes and the healing they receive at the end of the story. After reading the five star reviews, I was looking forward to enjoying this book. Unfortunately, it was very difficult for me to get through. Perhaps it's my lack of taste."
5,"a wonderful cd, thank you enrique for making it!!!!!!",this cd is sooooooooooooooooo great! i hope he keeps singing 4-ever and ever!
1,I would not recommend it as the best example of Latin music,This album is not much different from his first. Same predictable boring songs good enough for the unsofisticated teenagers. Very irritating and unpleasant voice.
4,The bomb disc,"In my humble opinion, this is King Enrique's best CD. It's a lot faster and better paced than his first CD, with a lot more standout tracks than any of his other CDs. My favourite is Miente, an awesome song combining a stirring piano/keyboard, short, sharp, powerful guitar riffs and a cool drum beat with Enrique's strong, moving vocals thrown on top. The next best is Solo En Ti, (which I know all the words to without knowing Spanish) it's a happy cool song. Revolucion is a mysterious, brooding song, and Lluvia Cae is cute with its reggae flavour and dub vocals. Totally phat CD."
5,MI ESPOSO,"THIS CD is the first cd I bought by Enrique when it first came out.that's when I started calling him ENRIQUE-THE GREAT- his voice gives me goose bumps every time I hear it and the thing is ,is that he does'nt even have to sing- he could just hum and I get chills MI ESPOSITO'S voice is truly amazing and right now he and his brother are exactly where I prayed they would be much love for this cd and every cd by Enrique love,sentira"
5,Handbook for someone dealing with SSD and W. Comp.,"I read the other reviews but I feel that it needs to be reviewed by a different perspective. I work in the business of securing SSD/SSI benfits for claimants. This book explains how SSD and Workmen's Compensation actually fit together. We hear all the time from injured workers that they were never told they could apply for SSD benefits, in this day and age this should not be happening. You need to explore every avenue open to you regarding benefits, this book gives you the blueprints, so to speak, to do this. In using this book it will show you how to navigate thru the system. No one said it would be easy but you can find comfort in realizing someone is watching your back. Every girl in our office has one...................I would like to hear from some of the other firms in the Bucks County area that handle SSD/SSI and Workmen's Compensation claims. What do you think??????"
4,A Compassionate Read,"It was touching to read how Ms. Freemer stood by her husband during a very difficult time in his and their lives. Also interesting to read about all the hassles that happen to a disabled person as he struggles to gain some order in his life. I think it would help any person facing such struggles to find affirmation from another experiencing similar things. Sad to read about how unsupportive our culture can be to one who is honestly disabled, but hopeful that a person can think positively, move forward and approach life anew."
3,7 Motivational Greats,"Information is very good, but the narrator is very distracting. Instead of reading the book, the narrator tries to imitate numerous voices and is more interested in acting than getting the information to the listener."
1,Not worth the time,"I bought these cds based on other reviews and I am very disappointed with them. I will begrudingly say that there is some subject matter falls in the ""OK"" catagorie but most of it is tired platatude of outdated ideas. Some of the talks are so reactionary as to be offensive. This work is hardly inspiring."
4,Facts About This Score,"To correct the previous reviwer's comment about this work being ""just the way Mussorgsky wrote it"", this reviewer would like to point out that the Dover score is a reprint of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's arrangement and orchestration. While a brilliant and deservedly popular work in its own right, Rimsky's arrangement was prepared about 5 years after the composer's death and bears only the most superficial resemblance to Mussorgsky's 1867 score (full title: St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain). The Dover reprint is very clean with a sturdy binding at a very reasonable price - certainly worth the 4 stars from this reviewer."
1,Not since Roxy Music,...2 great musicians found a way to fall out of favor....nothing worth downloading to iTune Library...already toss the CD....and I was so hopeful.
4,Almost...,"The magnet is'nt too strong, and, the numbers on the protractor vial have worn off after about three months in my bags. (My nail bags.) Other than that, I do love this little bugger. It is really light, so, I don't mind carrying it all the time. The horizontal & vertical vials work very well. Real clear, and quick to center...My wife suggested painting clear acrylic nail polish over the numbers on the adjustable dial. Too late for mine, but, may be a good idea for someone with a brand new one...aloha,"
3,Great Most Of The Time - But Not Always,"For most things I love this level. Good size, good feel and easy to read. However, there are things that people should know before they buy:1) The rotating vial is not flush to the side of the level; it sticks out. This means you can't press the level against a flat wall without it wanting to ""rock"".2) The end caps are tapered (why???). They don't hold the same line as the frame - they are narrower than the full width of the frame at the ends. You can't draw a complete line into a corner without removing a cap.3) The top vial is also not a continuation of the frame line. You can't draw a full straight line across the vial (it is recessed slightly).For most jobs these things aren't a problem. But when they are, they are a real pain; leading to the mixed review."
3,Rotating Vial not Flush,"It fits perfect in my tool bag. Easy to read. My only complaint, like other reviewers mentioned, is the rotating vial is not flush, it stickout."
5,"quality, viewability, functionality","""Levels"" are hardly the thing that draw ""reviews,"" one is pretty much like any other. I'd have to give the Stabila brand a two-thumbs-up rating. The subtle different in ""the bubble"" and color of the liquid that makes view- ability and usability a few notches above all others. Magnetic base of this particular unit is exceptional when working around metal items, kitchen drawer sliders in my instance, a god-send. No regrets at buying, even paying a bit extra for over other brands. Would buy it again."
3,close but no cigar,I was somewhat disappointed by the quality of this item. Perhaps I expected too much since I freely admit to being a novice jewelry purchaser.
3,Fun Book,"This book was cute and fun. I'd refer to it as a slightly more raunchy version of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Sure, it could use a little more character development and it left a few loose ends to be tied but overall it's worth a read. I read it sophomore year of high school which is the perfect age for a novel of this calibre. Reread it as an adult and it definitely wasn't as great as I remembered it but I'd recommend it for a 15-18 year old age range."

3,Enjoyable half hour,"It is, indeed, a short documentary clocking in at about a half hour. No new information but nicely done. Not a ""must have"" but enjoyable."
2,Just my opinion,"Too short; out of date documentary technique; amaturish production; Or, perhaps Ken Burns has spoiled me for life. Or, . . . . perhaps I'm just too hungry for information about Abraham Lincoln that doesn't exist. This production didn't tell me anything I didn't already know."
4,Hoover hand held vacuum,Good vacuum. Works well. I replaced an older Black & Decker unit of which I couldnt find a replacement and the Hoover is just as good.
4,So far So good on budget wet/dry vac,"Hoover S1120 Hand Held Wet/Dry Hand Vacuum CleanerThis vacuum working well thus far... plenty of charge for stairs and miscellaneous clean-ups. No attachments but thus far the built-on nozzle is working adequately for my needs. I haven't yet tried it on a wet pick up at this time.One con is that the unit is rather noisy, but bearable.For $30, and as it is both a wet and dry vac I feel it is an excellent investment."
3,It works,"The dustbuster is great for small spills, but it is super loud. I like that you can mount it on the wall, because it does make it super easy to locate and charge."
4,Rechargeable Hand Wet/Dry Vac very useful with PETS,"We've had several different similar units in the past, one with detergent dispenser. This one works fine with one spray bottle for detergent and one for rinse water, and the Hoover go-anywhere rechargeable hand vac. Simple, functional, fairly powerful, runs long time on one charge. I would like an attached brush to help loosen dried soil more quickly."
4,PERFECT PORTABLE VAC,"Perfect portable vacuum for tiny spills not worthy of hauling out the big vacuum. I have a cat, and he's always spilling food on to the floor and kitty litter on to the carpet. This works great for that. I also use it alot to clean my car, so I never have to go to those coin-operated machines at the car wash again.Charging is quick and easy; operating couldn't be simpler. If I was forced to find a flaw with it, it would be emptying. If the thing gets too full and you pick it up, some of the vacuumed pieces will fall out. Taking the back off to empty the vacuum in the trash is a minor problem. The filter has some hard plastic you grab on to and pull to remove...well, the plastic is in such a shape that it pinches your fingers when you pull to remove it.Like I said, very minor flaw. I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it."
3,It's Not Great,"I've owned this vacuum about 5 weeks. It's very average in my opinion, mainly because the suction power just isn't strong enough. You notice this particularly when you're using it to vacuum your car and the dirt and debris is somewhat ingrained in the shorter carpet. Just seems like you have to go over it several times to get all the dirt. It does work well on spills though (the wet vac part), and it does an okay job vacuuming stairs and other small jobs. Overall, I'd give it a very average rating."
3,Ok Product for the price,"The product overall was ""ok"" not the greatest considering it is a Hoover. Battery does tend to die very easily. I tried using this to vaccum my car floor and was unsuccessful with the little things -- (purpose of what I bought it for). Does great sucking up gunk after sweeping on my pergo floors - but again the hole is a bit too small therefore the suction power is not the greatest. I have had other machines that worked better. Note there are no attachments so that is not so great. The charging station is flimsy and kind of pointless unless you plan on hanging it up - otherwise the cord is all you need. Good Luck -- I wouldnt buy it again --"
1,This is trash! A minus1 star would be the proper rating,"What? Who are these people giving this item multiple stars? Are they crazy? Using this is like vacuuming with a soda straw. This is the most worthless bit of trash I have ever bought. Probably because of the way it is designed. The base of the nozzle--the part that actually touches the floor measures 3 inches by one inch--BUT look again. The actual hole through which things are sucked, measures a tiny one inch by 1/2 an inch! That is less than one square inch of suction. Plus the plastic surrounding the hole actually prevents you from getting close to the things you want to suck up. I can not believe that Hoover puts their good name on this useless little machine. Save your money. DO NOT BUY the Hoover hand held wet/dry vac."
4,Handy,"This is a great little accessory for quick pick ups when you dont want to lug your big vacuum out. It has good power and suction, it's pretty loud though and it's hard to empty but i still like it and would recommend it."
4,You're a cute little sucker,"Purchased as replacement for ""Dust buster"". Unit is adequate to the task of picking up smaller stuff. Have not used it for wet pickup at this time but would assume from suction that it would work as advertised. My wife's main complaint is that the power button MUST be held for unit to work. After a few minutes, it becomes troublesome to hold pressure on the power button. Power seems to be adequate as we use it for only a few minutes at a time. An improvement would be to have a ""switch"" user could place in ""ON or OFF"" position. Charging base receives power head very easily after a few practice dockings, unit is held securely and base can be wall mounted."
4,Not bad at all for the price...,"A little bit noisy but it does the job.Couldn't believe the sucking power in a chargeable, light vacuum."
3,It's okay.,"This vacuum cleaner works decently. It's nothing spectacular, but it least it picks up the cat liter. It is very loud though, so if you're kids are sleeping at night, this will wake them."
2,booo not good,"I really needed a hand held vaccum cleaner and thought that is looked like it was worth buying, I used it mabe 20 times, it worked great until it would not charge anymore. Finally after 2 month it died for good :( now i need to buy another one."
1,Useless!,"It's been years since I had a hand-vac, so I spent a lot of time researching the ones available. I decided on this one after reading the reviews, it appeared to be the best candidate for what I needed. Unfortunately, it hasn't been worth the purchase AT ALL! The opening is so small, that anything larger or longer than a cheerio is impossible to pick up. The design of the internal components make it even harder to just keep the debris inside the canister! To top it all off, the device only stays charged for seven minutes according to the manual -- I haven't been able to get it to function well after just a few minutes. There's so many negatives, instead of listing them all -- take my word that this product is a total waste.I've decided to just buy another stand vacuum to keep in place of where we were storing this hand-vac & use the stand vacuum's hose. This hand-vac is a definite inconvenience instead of connivence."
3,"light, cordless but not powerful","The product is light, cordless but not powerful.It can deal with light dust, bread crunches, but it cannot take hair or something similar."
4,Hand held vacuum,"So far this hand vacuuum works really great. I like it much better than the previous one I had that had a cord. This one I can take to my car and all over the house without trying to figure out where to plug it in. I wasn't sure I would like having to hold the power button down, but it saves the limited time you have before the battery dies. Haven't used the wet feature yet, but I'm sure it will come in very handy. I highly recommend the vacuum."
2,Lasted almost 90 days,"After less than 3 months of very light use, it is dead. I finally got around to screwing the charging plate to the wall and less than a week later it died. How's that for murphy's law? It was working fine Friday, went to pick up a pile of dust I swept up on Saturday amidst some home remodelling, and {silence} nothing. The button clicked and I smelled smoke. Not good. Honestly, I never loved this unit. You have to depress the button while you vacuum, making it difficult for my children to use and the recepticle is difficult to empty. Prior to this I had the Cone Vacuum, that I LOVED, but after stupidly using it to clean up a damp mess, it died. I've contacted Hoover to see what they will offer in the way of replacement."
3,"Ok, but not great on wet stuff",If you're looking for something that handles wet spills well you should probably keep looking. It doesn't have the right type of suction to handle the wet stuff well.
2,works ok,"it works ok, next time i will try a different product, the opening for suction is only in the middle and it has no power indicator, so you have no idea if you got it in the dock right and it is charging."
3,Good but.........,"This little vacuum worked very well for the first 2 years (almost), but now apparently the battery died and it don't hold the charge ( 5 mins max). So I have to plug it sometime before I want to use it. In other words, it's no good anymore."
2,Loud and Very Narrow Suction Point,"I bought this Hoover S1120 to replace an eight year old Black and Decker Dust Buster with similar features that finally quit on me.The two most noticeable differences are that this Hoover is twice as loud and the ""suction point"" hole is much narrower and smaller.I know hand held vacuums are loud, but this was much louder, almost ear piercing in fact.It doesn't pick up wet or dry spills like the old Black and Decker Dust Buster did.If I could do it over again I would not buy this Hoover S1120. I didn't give it one star because it does work, just not to the standard it should.Unfortunately I don't know of another hand held vacuum to recommend to you, so for now I'm back to the ol' broom and dustpan."
3,Cleaner!,"I looked to get a different model but after reading all the reviews, this was still the best around in its price range. It's powerful, compact and great for my office apt."
4,Grrreat,Best and most powerful handheld I've ever owned. Only negative I have is that you have to hold the switch for continuous operation
4,Little power house.,"I'm very pleased with the vacuum although I haven't used the wet feature yet. It performs well and is priced reasonably. My only negative criticism is how loud it is, but I can live with that."
4,"great vac, but hard to clean","This hand vac is powerful, and sucks debris in easily. However when it is time to empty it, the filter assembly resists coming apart without lots of effort. I have had two of this model of Hoover hand vacsHoover S1120 Hand Held Wet/Dry Hand Vacuum Cleaner, and both have this problem."
4,Sturdy Little Sucka,I'm surprised at the high build quality of this sucka. Noisy though. Easily glides in and out of the recharger. Impressive tolerances. A very good value.
4,Very simple to operate and does the job for me.,Not a bunch of small tools to deal with as others similar to this one do have. Operates and installs easily.
4,does what it says on the tin,"a good, useful little vacuum. pleanty of suck. would be better with a sliding / locking switch, rather than the 'hold it down all the time ' push button that it has, but this is a minor complaint."
2,It doesn't suck..that's the problem,I bought this thing to vacuum my auto so I wouldn't have to run down to the carwash every time it needed vacuuming. It doesn't have enough power to pick up the dirt on the floorboard or floor mats. So it's pretty useless.
1,Poor Quality,I purchased this item a few months ago and was very disappointed that after 2 uses the item would no longer charge. I called hoover and they said I would have to bring it to a service center to determine the problem. The item was only $25! It would cost more for me to arrange a drop off etc. I now know that hoovers are not the best item and they definitely do not offer accommodating customer service
2,Too Many Compaints,"Wish I could say I liked this little vacuum more. I'm not sure if this is a problem for most cordless vacuums, but I know I'm getting a corded handheld next time.My first complaint is that it takes forever to fully charge (to fully charge it can take several hours or more), and the charge life is extremely low. I noticed it losing power after only 10 minutes of continued use.As many other people have been saying, the suction power is also incredibly weak (and narrow!). I literally have to go over the same spot several times to pick everything up.I wish I was able to return it, but we've had it too long now.In addition, having to hold down the ""on"" switch in order to power it is a pain! Imagine having to hold that down while maneuvering it with the same hand. Poor design in my opinion. Overall, it's ok if what you need is a quick, low-power vacuum, but I'd recommend something else."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this minivac hit the sweet spot in terms of price and reviews but have found it to be really weak. It doesn't pick up the simplest things, like crumbs, and it takes a lot of effort and time to get it to pick up anything. Wish I had spent more in the first place and got something better."
5,"Worked so great, I had to buy 2.","Love the vacuum. It has great suction and is easy to clean out. I initially bought the vacuum to use in our RV. After testing it out around the house I loved it and immediately ordered a second one to keep in our house. Having a one year old who likes to drop half of everything she eats on the floor, I would consider this a great investment."
1,yup,"I purchased this hand held cordless vacuum, so I could vacuum my car for in between car washes. I have a two year old toddler that occasionally spills his cheerios or snacks in the back seat. After using this product, I am not satisfied. It does not vacuum everything up. If it had more power to it, it would of have been an awesome product. But hey it does the job!"
1,LOUD!,"We bought this ""hand vacuum cleaner"" about 2 months ago (Feb. 09) and immediately found it was (for us) incredibly loud. I thought I would get used to it . . . but I haven't. Perhaps it's just me (I wear a hearing aid) but I find using it to actually hurt my ears. I take my hearing aid out (reasonable enough, right?) but I also have to put something in my ears to make it even usable for me.If you have any type of hearing issue, or are just sensitive to (very) loud noises, I would consider another product.PS - Yes, I should have returned it immediately and yes, I do feel a bit silly having to take all the precautions I do, just to use this ""quick"" vacuum!"
3,Loved it for about a year,It's a nice little hand vac with reliable suction for about a year. Then it gets to a point where the battery just won't quite charge up like it used to. Hey for $25 I feel like I got my money's worth. It still sort of sucks but not powerful enough so I'm going to buy another one. I know I'll get a good year out of it.
3,"Great, EXCEPT for the Vacuum Mouth","This picks up messes great, but I have to empty it very often while trying to clean tiny pieces of my Bunny's hay, because the opening to this Vacuum (""Vac Mouth"")is VERY narrow, and is centered in the middle. aside from that issue, it lasts long after charging and is very easy to empty the filter (since i have to do that pretty often)"
2,Cleaning after a wet spill = YUCK,"Sucks ok. Fine for small dry spills, but you must develope a special technique to capture wet spills without making the clean up of the vac WAY more trouble than the original spill caused in the first place. Would not buy this again."
1,Battery Life is Terrible,"As several other reviewers have mentioned, the battery in this unit lasts about six months to a year. After that, you will get about 30 seconds of full power and then it slowly dies out. This comes in handy pretty much never. It has been uselessly hanging on the wall in my kitchen for a few months gathering dust (that it ironically can't vacuum up) and drawing electricity because I'm just not ready to throw out a $30 item. Hoover was once dominant in the vacuum industry, they should consider this product an embarrassment."
1,Very disappointing....,Very disappointing....doesn't suck well. Difficult to empty canister. I could not find one like I had before...thought it would work. Big mistake and waste of money.
2,Not impressed,"I have a Hoover full size vacuum so thought i would try the hand held vac. I am not impressed at all. The battery is practically dead after using for just a few minutes. The fan blows the light items(hair) around while trying to vacuum up which is annoying. Also Very loud. Suction is OK, nothing great. Probably much better options out there at the same price."
2,Underpowered,"I found this vacuum underpowered. Crumbs on the sofa required multiple passes to get them all off-- it took more than a minute. In addition, you have to hold the button down to keep the cleaner turned on, which is both annoying and hard on the thumb."
5,Love this vacuum!,"I love this hand held vacuum! It picks up great and the battery lasts a long time. If there was one thing I had to change though, the power button has to held down to keep it on verses just flipping a switch to turn it off and on."
3,have to hold down power button,"This works well for a hand vac, but you have to hold down the power button the whole time you're using it. It doesn't have an on/off style switch, but a button that requires continuous pushing. Annoying and makes my hand hurt. But other than that it work well."
1,Do not buy this,"It worked decently well for the first maybe 5 times. After that, it broke and now it ""vacuums"" for about 20 seconds before becoming completely useless. Seriously, do not buy this. Do not buy this. Do not buy this."
1,This is one vacuum that doesn't suck!,"Would love to give a more complete review of this product, but after two attempts to charge it for more than 18 hours, I got at best 5-10 seconds of use out of it. I say ""use"", but I really mean ""the motor was spinning."" There was no suction, since there was no charge in the battery at all.I've had a lot of vacuums that totally suck. This one doesn't at all."
4,Get's the Job Done Conviently,"The product is what I expected and was a great price. It comes with a wall mount... awesome... There's no cord to drag around, it is always charging while plugged in and on the doc. It is easy to empty and light weight. The item is very loud for such a little unit, the coloring is a bit cheezy; I'd much rather it a neutral color so it doesn't stand out as much on my wall... not the biggest deal. I like how the nozzle is shaped, I can push it up against furniture and walls because it has an angle. It sometimes does leave a little crumbs, lint, dirt behind and that is why I gave this a four star rating."
1,review,I anticipated a vacuum that I could use for months before changing the battery. This device needs to be recharged after 7 minutes of use. Another example of modern technology going backwards.
5,Very powerful,For a $25 vacuum i was not expecting such vacuum power. It just sucks anything that is close by the spot i aim at. the only draw back is that you have to keep pressing down on the button to keep it turn on otherwise it will shut off. i dont mind it though as i only use it briefly each day for the bathroom floor.
4,No complaints,"Haven't yet tried it as a wet vacuum, but it works perfectly well as a dry vacuum. A crevice tool would be a plus."
3,Mixed review,"This Hoover portable vaccum has great suction and more than meets my expectations. On the down side, after I emptied the cup, I could not get the vacuum cleaner back together. It does not ""catch"" on the clip. This happened after only one use."
5,Great item,"Just bought the second one. I like it, The power is enough for cleaning both car and home. Easy to use. The only thing is missing, is the led indicator for charging."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,Suction is poor. Have to go over a spot several times with the center of the nozzle. I returned it.
5,Hoover Wet/Dry Hand Held Vacuum,"This is a powerful vacuum. It's a little loud, but if you want a vacuum that can pick good the noise come with it. The only problem with it is there are no attachments for special pick ups. It has a large dust/dirt filter so you don't have to clean it in short times. It's what I've been looking for."
5,Great Cordless Hand Vac,"I bought this cordless hand vac based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I have had it for a month and it rocks. Very powerful and very easy to use and clean. It has a built in filter that is reusable and washable. It only lasts about 5 to 10 minutes, but that is fine for my needs. It comes with a recharging unit and is easy to plug in and remove it. I highly recommend this cordless hand vacuum."
5,Love it!,"This hand held vac is great! The charge lasts for quite a while and it's pretty powerful for small jobs. I haven't used it on a spill yet so I'm not sure how that feature is. It's a good weight and very easy to use. A couple of things to know though, 1) You must hold down the button to use it. 2) It is a little on the loud side. 3) The bottom gets scratched pretty easily. But for a rechargeable hand vac at this price it's fantastic!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Pros:*Easy to clean*Suction is ok for the price*Good for easy, quick clean upsCons:*Gunk gets built up and stuck too easily*Can only vacuum for about 5-7 minutes before having to recharge again (several hours)*Fan blows air out 1 side, so anything on that side gets blown across the floor (making it inefficient to clean)*Not the best when trying to clean carpet or your carOverall:*I would pay a little bit more and get something that does a better job."
2,It stinks,"Is there a way to really power this thing up? I bought it to do quick car clean ups and for getting right around the woodstove. It stinks at both jobs. You'll just stand there trying to suck up dirt and crumbs with this thing, and not much happens. Forget about getting anything bigger than a pea. It makes noise, and not a lot more. Blah."
3,Compact convenient but can't pick up lint or fuzz,"I bought this hand held vacuum mainly for my car. Yes, it powerful to pick up small objects; such as snack crumbs, small pieces of trash or dirt, but it doesn't work with lint or fuzz on the carpet or seat. You'll need to brush the surface before you vacuum. I decided to keep it for my kitchen floor. In the mean time, still bringing my car to carwash."
2,Finicky Recharging,"Its not a great model as it turns out- it takes 24 hours to charge for about 15-20 minutes of use. And, it's finicky when it comes to recharging, sometimes it won't have recharged at all so I learned from another review that you have to then drain it and then recharge it. The suction is not very strong."
4,Good hand held vacuum,"So far so good. Just got the hoover hand held vacuum cleaner last week. It's powerful and picks up stuff pretty good. The only downfall is that you have to continually keep the button pressed to use it. I would prefer if it had an on/off button that I only had to press once when I want to use it, but at least it does what it's supposed to do. Overall, good product for the price"
4,Good when you have a baby around,"I asked for and received this last Christmas. It has been very helpful after my 19 month old finishes eating. It also took care of the pile of salt that she created on my kitchen table, after getting the shaker open! My four year old actually enjoys using it as well. He searches for dust and crumbs on the kitchen floor to suck up. My only issue with it, as some other reviewers have mentioned, is that the exhaust vents on the side, and can end up blowing the very things you're trying to clean up."
4,good value in a hand vac,I'm very pleased with this hand vac that I use mainly to pick up stray litter (two cats) and crumbs from kitchen floor and counter. Only drawback that I wish I had known is that you must hold the on switch on. You can't just switch it on.
2,"Does not perform as promised, design is flawed","I got this because I needed something that could clean up a variety of messes (I have 3 kids). Pretty much all it's good for is vaccuming up PILES of dirt. It does not have strong suction at all. It barely holds a charge.Most annoying of all, the ""on"" button has to be held down during use. I vaccuumed a flight of stairs and my wrist was very stiff and painful afterwards from having to push down on the button with my thumb. It is now sitting in my closet, only to be used in place of a dustpan when I sweep arounf the wood stove."
4,what a suprise - in a good way,good more then expected - bought it 8 months agoonly minus is the noise that good be too much but not a reason to say no to the product
3,could be better,"It does what I wanted it tom which was clean my car, the only down fall is that the battery died right away. I have only used it one."
4,Hoover Wet/Dry Hand Vac,"Bought this one to replace another hand vac that died of old age! It picks up very well and holds the charge very well. It is a bit of a struggle to remove the bag to empty, but maybe I just need to do it a few times. You can see how much ""junk"" you have picked up, and you don't have to empty it each time you use it. Great vac for the price! Thanks Hoover Co."
1,Unusable - they wobble,I bought two of these thinking the price was too good to pass up. Unfortunately they both wobble visibly and wish I'd passed. Maybe I'll try to true them up myself like the previous reviewer but I'll probably just trash them and buy a good one.
3,"OK, but not high quality","This faceplate is sold at a great price, and for that reason I have given the product 3 stars. On the plus side, the faceplate screws onto the lathe just fine. The finish is OK, but not great. Still, very serviceable. The faceplate wobbled when I ran it on my lathe. It would NOT have been serviceable, but I was able to use normal lathe tools to shape the product so it ran true. The aluminum is soft and fairly easy to trim. I had to trim the edge, the face, the back, and the shaft of the faceplate before it stopped wobbling. Now it runs OK.If you do not want to go through that kind of hassle buy a more expensive faceplate. I am sort of a cheap type and I am willing to do these kinds of things (trim the faceplate) to get a cheap tool to work right. A few times this has not worked out so well, but this time it did.AD2"
3,The Field Guide to North American Hauntings :,An entertaining book but one that struck me as absurd at times. Blackman tended to rate a large number of spirits as dangerous and kept warning that headless ghosts might well take the head of a mortal to replace their own missing head. The most off the wall section of the book is a survey form which one is to use to question any ghost he might meet. I don't know about anyone else but should I meet a ghost I don't suspect I will take the time to ask it to fill out a short survey for me.
4,I was surprised,This book was rather good. I actually found some things local to me and I live in the middle of no where. I liked this book. Covered a lot of areas of the U.S. and was pretty well written. I enjoyed this book.
3,"very intersting , but some parts were a little weird.","i have read many books on this subject. i found this book to be very interesting. There were some things i found that were a little strange. For instance, the part were he said that a headless ghost might try to take your own head ""come on!"" Overall, it's a good book, but for those true ghost hunters who are serious about these things, this book might be a little dissapointing."
2,Dissapointing! No scary stories here...,"More historical and folklorish than actually about ""hauntings"". Worth a read but not for much money! Check it out at the library, save your money, you'll be more satisfied. Being native american and LOVING ghost stories, I had high hopes that I could connect with this book . NAW. I was very dissapointed!"
3,Hoped for more,"I'm always on the lookout for good books about hauntings, and this book was decent, but its faults overshadowed its credits. The historical info (albeit unsourced) seems credible and well written, the ""hunting"" and ""living with ghosts"" tips seemed absurd -- example: when living with a ghost, set a place for them at dinner. Disapointing."
2,Way too short for a doom and gloom documentary,24 minutes to explain the end of the world? How cute. You would have been better off reading Revelation 6:12-17 from the good book. It's much cheaper than buying this DVD and just as helpful!
5,Great book by true baseball fan,I met Steve when he came to Texas for the A's vs. Rangers series a few years back and I was working in the radio booth. I was impressed by his baseball knowledge and I so I bought the book. The book is a masterpiece and you got to get it if you are a Giants fan! I a Texas Rangers fan and loved it! Good stuff!
5,Amazing!,"This book will truly help you and kids see how gigantic the ark actually was, and to understand the true conditions that it was built under. It shows how many train box cars would have fit in the ark, how the pens could have been built, gives lots of comparisons so kids can truly wrap their minds around this miracle. Illustrations are beautiful. I used it to teach kids at a homeschool co-op and at children's church. It fascinated kids from 3 to 13, and me, too!"
5,The True Story of Noah's Ark,Our kids absolutely love this book! The pictures are amazing and the accuracy is so much better than the typical book on Noah and the ark.
1,"Origin of the word ""Genocide""?","Forget those nagging questions such as the 23,000 foot depth of water needed to submerge the highest mountains, the lack of air and sub-zero temperatures at that altitude... My question is why this was taught to me and millions of other children as a cute fairy tale... instead of what it was... the first ""Genesis""-ocide. Why do the illustrations show the cute giraffes and zebras instead of drowning babies? Why were the billions of sinless creatures and plant drowned along with the ""sinners""?Why would a god who supposedly ""loves"" humans do this? If he wanted to start over, why didn't he magically sterilized the human race(OK not Noah)... a lot simpler than the flood, and a lot less murderous, and take a more patient approach... after all, he has plenty of time. He set a fine example for Hitler, Stalin, Milosovec, etc."
3,Okay telling of the general story,"As is true with so many films about historical events, this film is not completely accurate. However it does follow the general story as described in the Book of Judges in the Bible. The primary Hollywood elaboration is the long term relationship between Samson and Delilah. Whereas the Bible only reports a relationship at the end of Samson's life, this film portrays Delilah as the scorned lover who threw herself at Samson from the very beginning of his story. The film is also somewhat dated in style simply because it came out in 1949. Not bad, but could be better."
2,Samson & Delilah,I found that this DVD was of poor quality. The company that reproduced it did a very poor job. The color was not as acute as the one I saw on TCM. Victor Mature is one of my favorite actor of all times. Samson & Delilah is one of my favorite films with Victor Mature. But because the quality was so poor I had to returned it and to have a credit given to my account at amazon.com. Story wise I would give it 5 stars but for the quality of the reproduction I would rate it a zero.
4,The bible according to deMille,"This is one of the films which are greater than life and does not have much to do with reality. One either likes it or not. I liked it. The visuals are great and the emotions flourish. If you liked the ten commandements, you will like this, too."
4,samson ..,the tape have some chinese or other fpreign subtitle language and i wish i knew about it efore purchasing it
4,Sampson & Delilh,Excellent. I am 84-years old and remember the film from when it was initially placed into the movie theatres. I apparently mistakenly ordered the movie thinking it was the original version but received a second version of this movie featuringBelinda Buer & Anthony Hamilton and was sadly disappointed to see Victor Mature playing the part of Sampson's father. What a let down.
1,Not comfortable,"The foam on this pillow is to hard, and the pillow is way to small. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this pillow.I paid 23.00 for the pillow. The seller has offered a refund - 5.00 restocking fee. So I pay to return a 23.00 productwith a 5.00 restocking fee and that doesn't leave much change. I will try to buy from Amazon only and not an Amazonseller from here on out, because they stand behind their products with a full refund."
4,Leg pillow,"I didn't realize that it had an elastic band to hold it to one leg.After using it for awhile, I understand the need for the band, butit comes lose sometimes and those velcro hooks are uncomfortable.A single round pillow without the elastic would work better for me.Otherwise, the pillow is fine and I will continue to use it."
3,Way to big,This is a text book not a memory jogger. I was serious expecting a 2-10 page foldout or some sort of flowchart.Good material but a lot more than a memory jogger.
5,Nice Little Level,"Handy little level. Magents are VERY powerful. Excellent fit and finish. Holster is good quality, too."
4,Stabilla Torpedo Level Review,"I do not need the 30 or 45 degree bubble, so for me the Stabilla is better than the checkpoint in every aspect except for the need of a magnet on the end of the level, for when bending stubs in conduit."
5,Solid Level,"This is a quility level. It is made up of metal with the level tube encased in a solid plastic cube. Compared to my other levels, this is deisgned with quility and craftsmanship in mind. as far as the accuracy, i would rely on it more than my other levels as the bubble seems to jump to one side if it's not percisly level, this helps when leveling.It has two small magnets underneeth that are recessed into the level and do not cause any mis-reading. These magnets are very powerfull. you have to pull hard to get it off metal.update:In the end, because one side is not flat, I can't check level for a second level or place a 2x4 over it. The magnet is so hard that I cannot pull it off the peice to see how far off level it is to choose a shim, and frankly, I use the other levels as they are lighter, don't make a loud BANG when they fall. I would have been ok, with not buying this item."
3,So disappointed,"I haven't used it in practice, but just out of the box I am puzzled about it. For this level, you can put it on its side to get a reading in two directions from two separate levels on the unit, which seems great. You can also use it magnet side down and get a single reading from one of the levels.Here's the problem, I am getting two different readings from the same level, depending on if I put it magnet down or on its side in the same exact place. Ughhhhhh!!!!!I don't think I'm going to go through the trouble of returning it because I need it, although I'm not sure which way is the accurate way and which is wrong. I think using the magnet side is probably the better reading since you'd think it was flat. I also hate returning things and threw away packaging thinking I would never return a nice, German made level."
1,Not for hard workouts at all.,"I bought one of these armbands for running and it has been nothing but trouble. This armband appeared to be designed well for running. Given this, I was suprised how much this band doesn't protect the ipod from sweat. Also, the band is impossible to clean without ruining the velcro. After two months, the band smells really bad (even though it barely gets wet) and I can't clean the smell out. Definitely pick another solution. Some might think smell shouldn't be a problem, but anything that affects your run is a bad thing."
2,another overpriced ipod accesory,"I love my shuffle, but I am disgusted by the ridiculous prices of accessories. Perhaps the ipod is like a game console - the unit is sold at a loss and the games are where the money is made? But there isn't an iPod accesory under $30, whether it's a piece of velcro or a ziploc bag. OK for priveleged children of the rich, but the shuffle was supposed to be for us common wage-earners. A simple armband shouldn't be more than my phone bill!!"
1,White? For something I'm gonna sweat on?,"I bought one of these w/ my Shuffle when they first came out. I could not find an alternate style at that time. I run marathons and lift weights, and let me tell you, the formerly white armband is white no longer. The material is not stretchy enough for weight-lifting either. I have to adjust it a couple of times during weight workouts as my muscles get swollen w/ excess blood flow as I lift. When I wear the armband with the device while running, I have noticed that sweat pools in the little USB receptacle. My Shuffle (w/ which I am also disappointed) became rusty at the USB portion and has had to be replaced twice since March 2005. I tried to get my money back the second time, but to no avail. Bottom line: Apple stuff looks cool, but that's about it. I'd prefer something ugly and functional instead."
1,Great way to lose customers....,"Just when I thought that I will learn to forego the screen and use the screenless iPOD shuffle, I learn that I have to pay 30% of the price for an armband - otherwise the unit will keep on bouncing on my chest as I tire out on the treadmill.Guess what, the reason I was planning to go for the shuffle was that I needed less songs - so I can do with even less and buy the 256MB Sandisk with band, looks, et al at $70."
1,Awful,"This is very disappointing. It's huge, cumbersome, and uncomfortable. The worst part is that it's not elastic at all - just a hard rubberized canvas strap - so if you actually put it around your arm, it's alternately too loose and too tight as your arm muscle flexes just during a normal range of motion.Plus, locating your Shuffle on your arm for jogging or running is just a bad idea. The cord ends up dangling and flapping around too much, getting in the way.I bought this for running after getting new running shorts that didn't have pockets. I ended up switching to a belt clip to hold it to my waistband. Much, much better!"
5,Its expensive....It works.....Its Apple,"OK, so it costs 1/3 as much as the IPOD. But unlike most cute little workout-related stuff, it does work as advertised.I do some pretty hard aerobics and weights, and the armband works great. The neoprene doesn't slide, and it doesn't absorb sweat. I have never had a problem with the IPOD falling off or falling out of the socket on the armband.In short, it works as advertised. Wish it was cheaper, but it isn't."
3,"When you buy Apple, you pay for the marketing","OK, the product is fine. I don't have to hold my I-pod when I run anymore, which is nice. And the armband stays on fairly well. But it is kind of a pain to put on at times, and more than that - it's totally overpriced considering what it actually does. Look at all the Ipod accessories - they're priced with a margin the rivals bottled water.When I bought the armband, I was annoyed but not yet angry. A couple of weeks later, I bought the ear buds: $40 for headphones that fall out of my ears every 15 seconds. The problem - Apple emphasizes ""style"" over design. They're pricing based on Marketing, not on value. And I, for one, am totally done buying anything but their core products - and even for core products, will only buy after thorough research and testing."
1,A Terrible Product,"The method used to secure the Ipod to the band is horrible. After 20 minutes of activity (jogging), the piece that accepts the usb end came loose, sending my ipod to the ground. A terrible product. Apple is only concerned with ""artistic"" styling at the expense of actual function."
3,"Works well, but fragile","Typically stylish Apple product, but provides little protection for the Shuffle and, when knocked against gym equipment (as I did the third time I wore it), is likely to disintegrate on contact."
4,Cables Unlimited 10x12 Anti Static Bags,"Cables Unlimited 10x12 Anti Static bags are perfect for storing/shipping small motherboards, CD/DVD Drives, or larger cards. The thickness is pretty good and they are not easily punctured. These bags do not have an enclosure or zipper, which is fine in my case as I planned to seal with tamper evident seals. If you are looking for anti static bags for motherboards, I'd recommend the 12x16 as they will generally fit just about any motherboard."
2,De gustibus non est disputandum,"Since historical facts concerning Henry Purcell are skimpy, the writers and producers of this Monty Python account of his life decided to fill in the details with actors in period dress hamming it up through various time periods, including the present. It's a pity, because we really do need a serious documentary on Purcell -- and this certainly doesn't fill the bill. (Incidentally, the accent seems to be shifting around again from Purcell' to Pur'cell, to Purcell'. Which is it?)The two stars I have given the effort are solely for John Eliot Gardiner's always splendid (but here, chopped up and scattered) musical contribution -- which, after reading the initial florid review, is the only reason I finally bought the dvd. Buyer beware!"
2,"England, My England -- The Story of Henry Purcell","The music was great, but the movie had neither closed captions nor subtitles. As I'm getting a bit hard of hearing and the British accents were a bit thick, I followed very little of the story. It might have been great, but other than the vaguest outlines of the birth, life and death of Purcell and the events of his era, with which I was somewhat acquainted, I didn't know what was going on. It may well have deserved more than two stars, but I couldn't tell. Closed captions or subtitles should be standard. The description of the DVD suggested to me that it had captions, but the copy I received did not."
5,A magical book,"I was pleasantly surprised when reading this book which is definitely something different in the market of lesbian fiction.The story and the skilled writing of the author captivates and leaves one with the urge to read it again,cause you are left with the feeling that if you read it a second and a third time you will see things you haven't noticed before.It's not just another love story or a story between two people with an age difference. There is so much more to it.I really appreciated this book and can't wait for the sequel,anxious to find out if the author was able to write with the same magical skill again."
5,Finally,"Finally, a lesbian book with a somewhat new twist. The characters are well developed and you seem to feel what they feel.Good writing and a plot that keeps you interested. A few typos, but nothing so bad that it's distracting.I look forward to more from this author."
3,No Answers for the Review Pages???,"I don't see the answers for the review pages. These analogies makes me say ""I am not smarter than a 5th grader."""
1,mama 2!!!! oooh randy!,"wow! i know this kid! he's in my class! i had no idea he was ""famous"" or whateverhis real name is julio rivera. i know him a ton. he's obsessed with hilary duff and he is very feminine.I HATE HIS GUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTSAlso, he has no talent a-da-whatsovaa.....toe?No, but seriously. don't buy this albumm...n?It's for jerks.And your mom.And your toe.AND SPIDERMAN!"
2,Old news,I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't gain any new information from it. The information was basically a repeat of everything we already know about Alzheimer's Disease.
2,"clumsy interviews, some good material though","I have a background in neuroscience and have also spent many years as a meditation practitioner. It's rare to find individuals who straddle both worlds - the scientific and the contemplative - so it's easy to get hopes up when I believe I've found a resource that (skillfully) furthers this dialoge. More often than not, those hopes are thwarted. This series is yet another example of the latter (thwarted hopes). There were some wonderful moments with the interviewees, but the interviewer was extremely clumsy in his approach. I'd definitely like to see a better production effort next time 'round!"
3,Uncertain what they meant the movie to be,"This is a good movie eventually but I wish they had made up their minds right at the start whether it was to be a comedy or a drama. Ms Davis excells in drama. The first part of the movie with all the stupid acting suitors acting ridiculous just isn't up to the standards of her usual movies. There could have been numerous suitors without it descending into farce. The fact that Fannie is a silly foolish woman could be established less heavy handedly. Later on the movie gets better and the ending is very moving. It is certainly not one of her better movies but that is the fault of the script not in her performance. I would have thought that she would have ""put her foot down"" so to speak about all the stupidity in the first part of the movie. Even later on when she is obviously older but still ""holding court"" with numerous suitors was played too much for comedy. This movie should have been a drama all the way."
4,You can't beat it.,"You can groan at the the corny philosophy, smirk at Bette's hammy technique, gloat over how immune you are to the hokey charm of this old war-horse... but by the end you'll be sitting among the damp Kleenex wishing you'd been loved the way Mr. Skeffington loved Fannie. Raines has all the subtilty Bette lacks, but it's still the Bette Davis magic that makes the movie an enduring classic."
2,Not for Bette,"I love Bette Davis, and have many of her films, but the absurd characters of Mr and Mrs. Skefinton is so idiotic and unsympatheic, that it doesn't fit Davis or Raines. Ms. Davis has played the spoiled rich beautiful young woman before, as in Jezebel, and done it well, but the characters around her were written well also, and the costumes worked well, not so in Mr. Skefington.The story is simply unbelievable. Mr. Skefington, Claude Rains, plays a proud man who came from a poor family, but because of his intellect and ability, became a rich, smart and shrewed business man. From that character, he is turned into a blitering idiot after he meets Bette. He allows her to turn him into a weak and naive man without any strenght of character. Also in this film, Bette's very high pitched voice, which got higher as she got older was nerve wracking. This part was not for Ms. Davis or Mr. Raines."
3,too smart for the role,"Yes, a must for Bette Davis fans (and at age 43, she is still MY favorite actress), but for me Fanny Trellis never really works because Bette Davis is so darn intelligent that I can never completely buy her character as an airhead. In fact, a more shallow actress might have made the character more interesting! Clothes and sets are fantastic, though. I will say this...she did convice me she was beautiful. One of my favorite scenes in a movie is her bursting through with ""George, George dahling!"" So fun to imitate!"
5,One of Bette Davis' best!,"Proves again that Bette Davis was not afraid to be ""ugly"" on camera. She put acting before stardom.Great pairing with Claude Rains. Movie is more of a lesson in ""vanity"". Has a happy ending tho.Look for small role played by Bill Kennedy...for you Detroiters who remember him as host for many years,to a local program that showed classic movies"
4,Mr. Skeffington,quite a film...but some cutting could have helped. Last scene viewers should be warned to be prepared with a handkerchieHow the Nazis agreed to free him is never really explained......f..
4,great,very good story. kept your interest. i give 4 stars. i look foward to more interstingstories like this one. Thank you
1,Ear buds to big,"Ear buds were way to big for my ears, other then that they would be great to have, but sadly they are not"
5,Amazing art-garage,"This album will blow your mind! Definitely the ultimate Danish rock album (lyrics are in English) The style on this album is raw garage with an arty twist. Potent songs like 'Abyss revisited' and 'Pincchio Loose' go right for your throat while 'Ode to Billie Joe' (originally by Bobby Gentry)is sung with such pathos it brings a chill down your spine. This reissued cd-version contains an extra disc with rarities, among them some cover versions if Black Sabbath, T. Rex (partly sung in Russian!), Roky Erickson and Tex Ritter. A must-buy if you are into garage rock Scandinavian style."
5,"The ""Ace"" of Bass","Ludwig Streicher is well known in musical circles for his orchestral performances. This is understandable since the double bass is not considered a recital instrument. This disc will definitely change your opinions. The virtuosity of Herr Streicher is absolutely amazing. He brings out the real voice of this instrument and it will be surprising to listeners who have never heard the total range of the bass. The highlight of this recital is the final work, ""a bassist's nightmare."" It is an incredible amalgam of some of classical music's greatest hits. If this were not enough, the audio quality of this CD is outstanding!"
2,Disappointed,"The CD-5638 Bag does not have pockets per Amazon decription-""Store or transport three packs of borders in each of five clear plastic 37"" x 4"" pockets - 15 total!"". Also, it does not measure ""Overall 38"" x 25"". It is actually 30"" x 24"". I think this is the same bag as the ""Deluxe Bulletin Board Storage Pocket Chart"" which is significantly cheaper."
3,marky mark and the funky bunch,I like the music Mark Wahlberg made with his funky crew.I loved the glamour and nice clothing in the clips.Very quickly changing pics !...I also love to see Marky Mark move his beautiful body dance and move !...
1,A worthless copy of Beard's work,"If I could of given a lower rating than one star i would have. Quite frankly the book sold by this particular publisher borders on fraud. There is no artwork. Which makes this book a pointless book of text, without any redeeming value. While Beard's orginal work is a fine example of this type of work, the company that published this edition hasn't a clue. Highly recommend you don't purchase this edition of Beard's work you will be sorry. Any edition of Beard's, other than this edition will be a worthly addition to your library."
1,Cheap copy with out pictures,"Like all the other 1 star reviews who got this book after 2010, i recieved a cheap rip-off computer print out. every paragraph says to refer to (Fig. x) but there is not a single picture in the book. yet now where in the description does it say this is a computer printed out copy. I mean the i can handle the cheap computer printed pages, but the lack of photos makes building very difficult."
1,Ruined a Great Book,"The copy I received was a poor recreation of the original that included ZERO of the important diagrams and pictures. The book is full of references to illustrations and there are none. It was recreated with the use of OCR and not very well. It is full of unintelligible typos. And, the worst part is, the Amazon Look Inside feature on this page was showing a very different copy of this book. The one shown on the page is the original, and has the actual images included. I'm returning this now and buying the proper book."
4,Classic work in the area of Karmic Astrology,I used to own this entire series until a certain nasty hurricane destroyed my astrology collection! This and his book on the Part of Fortune were tomes that I used frequented and are still worth owning even years later. When these were published few astrologers were taking the nodes seriously. Today they are a main staple in many branches of astrology from Synastry to Progressions and Solar returns. Grab this book at these basements prices but you may also want to check out the new node book by Celeste Teal that covers them in the above mentioned areas.
5,Awesome Book,"I had this book before and someone borrowed it and never returned it. I am so happy to have it again. It is very straight forward and kind of harsh in its explanations. However, it has excellent content with perceptions that open you up to a whole new understanding for karma and the north node."
4,Great for understanding Nodes,"I really appreciated this book for understanding how the nodes work within the astrological chart, gave me a new perspective on things. Made me interested in the additional volumes."
4,Magnificent!,"Sir Patrick Ramsay came to visit his married mistress Serena and her eligible young cousin, a possible candidate for the position of his wife. He never expected to be attracted to Chloe Transome, the chit's proper duenna, an aging spinster of 29 years. As they deal with their personal securities, the lovers are beset by jealous relatives, eager to destroy them.Get your hankies out for the denoument of this tale of two lonely people afraid to trust in love. This regency is not a sedate book of manners, expect lots of love scenes, witty and risque repartee and an emotional ride that will leave you sighing in satisfaction at the end."
1,Look back before you buy,"Be sure to look back at the prechter calls. His basic overview was great - but the devil is in the details. He missed badly from around 2001. Yes, he called for this bear market - the top and time to short and kept shorting as he called tops on the way up from 2002 to 2007, would not have anything left now. No one was able to time this market and don't believe that Prechter did."
3,"We've been here before, haven't we???","...a great package of some of the better public domain exploitation/grindhouse/drive-in films, which include the following titles:Beast of Yucca Flats (1961)Die Sister, Die (1974)Drive-In Massacre (1974)Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter (1965)Rattlers (1976)Scream Bloody Murder (1972)She Demons (1958)Track of the Moonbeast (1976)...and now the bad news!!! For those who invested their hard earned money into the same company's multi-movie set, called ""Grindhouse Classics"", guess what?? The company merely recycled the same titles into this multi-movie set, and then, revamped the packaging. In the end, here we have a clear-cut case of 'Buyer Beware'....."
3,Executive Sandbox Sand Trap Golf,We ordered three of these for decorations at our son's rehearsal dinner.They were fun and brought great comments to the evening. The onlydisappointing thing was they don't have a way to store them well once thepackage is opened. There is nothing to store the sand in or the littlecomponents.
5,It's About Time!,"Finally, Joan's best performance on DVD - Possessed (1947). And what a plus to see Humoresque and The Damned Don't Cry included. But with Mildred Pierce (which we all own already) and The Women currently out on DVD, why not finish out Joan's collection with the films she did in her five years at Warners; ie, Flamingo Road (in which she double bitch slaps Sidney Greenstreet to hilarious effect), Goodbye, My Fancy (Joan as a congresswoman - we need her more than ever!), and This Woman Is Dangerous (which is not nearly as bad as you have been led to believe). I guess we wait. And wait for Harriet Craig (Columbia) and Daisy Kenyon (20th Century Fox) as well."
3,Could've been better!!,"Don't get me wrong because i'm really glad they released a boxed set of joan crawford films, but i don't get why they include 2 films that were already on dvd with the set. those were the women and mildred pierce. sudden fear and flamingo road would've been excellent choices instead. i hope one day they release a 2nd boxed set with her movies from the 30's. movies like strange cargo, possesed(1931), dancing lady, sadie mckee, etc."
4,Nice collection,Nice collection - wish the closed captions were a little faster though on a couple of the movies!
4,TCM Greatest Classic Legends: Joan Crawford,"TCM Greastes Classic Legends: Joan Crawford was not the combination of Joan Crawfordmovies I was looking for, but I settled because it was only combo available that came theclosest. It was a gift that was excepted with pleasing results. Almost any JC movie would be good."
5,Joan's finest piece of work,"For those that doubt Joan's acting ability these movies can turn doubters into believers! Four of the five films come from Joan's Warner years (including her Oscar-winning material from Mildred Pierce and Oscar-nom for Possessed). Humoresque -- a film mixed with romance, music and tragdey is a masterpiece. The Women -- an all-woman cast blended with cattiness and gossip and one of the first movies Joan plays a b**** in. The Damned Don't Cry -- based on a true story a woman who leaves her sad, dissatified homelife that lands her in the crime world. On the Mildred Pierce disc there is a filmdoc on the legendary actress (BEWARE: Christina is in it trying to discredit). I don't buy box sets regularly this though I couldn't pass up as a Joan fan."
4,"A ""Feeling"" Fan Must-have!","While it is true that this mini-album was released as a sort of ""preview"" of things to come, it is better suited for a fan who is attempting to round out their collection of ""The Feeling's"" recordings. Two of the tracks, ""Sewn"" and ""Helicopter"" can be found on the full-release album ""Twelve Stops and Home,"" but the other tracks ""When I Return"" and ""All You Need To Do"" cannot currently be purchased in any other media form in the U.S., not even on iTunes; so if you're looking to hear more songs by these up-and-coming pop/rock dynamos, then the aquisition of ""Four Stops and Home"" is a great buy! It is an ablum definitely worth having just to hear latter tracks and to watch the beautifully disturbing video for ""Sewn."""
4,Book is written before Bujinkan time,"Rating of 4 stars is because it contains interesting techniques.Is believable technique manual. Easy to understand.Contains also believable history and weaponology, withoutbeing cheesy about them. Writer has done historical researchwithou a doubt"
5,Illustrated True Crime,Very good and graphic reading. I enjoyed this book and could hardly put it down. Thank you for your fast service. This book was filled with everything you want in a crime. The pictures was good close-up shots. very very interesting!
3,One small error,"There is one, just one, small error in the book. On pages 442-443 there is a photo of a body partially covered by a tablecloth and the caption reads: ""Dead Judge, 1978. Italian Judge, Riccardo Palma was assassinated by the red brigade in Rome on 14 February 1978, as he stopped to buy a newspaper""But the photo is not of the Judge, but of the body of Carmine Galante, the acting Boss of the Bonanno crime family. Who was killed by a typical mob hit, on July 12, 1979 in the backyard of a Retaurant in Brooklyn, New York after eating a meal. Also, there exists other photos of his body (not printed in the book unfortunately) without the tablecloth covering him up. And those photos show a cigar still clutched in Galante's mouth."
1,I threw the book away.,"I don't do that normally, but these photographs of events and objects were beyond conceivable normal behavior by human beings and I just didn't want the book in the house, or even be reminded of it. No accounting for taste.Shipping was very fast, the book came as advertised in great condition, but even 17 cents for the book plus shipping did not stop me from chucking it."
5,Excellent quality - excellent price!,"Cannot beat this air hose. I needed a fast temporary solution to run an air line about 80' from a porch to a garage. Not interested in a hard line as it was a rental for 2 months. Liked this so much this is all I use now. I did take this now though and cut it into 25' sections as I dont want to use 100' in the shop everyday... so this was like 5 hoses in one. Great, excellent value."
3,Not one of Rubinstein's shining moments,"I am a huge Artur Rubinstein fan - he is, without question, one of the truly great pianists of the 20th century. But I'm sorry to say I have to agree with the other reviewers who were disappointed in this performance - a little sluggish, lacking in energy and fire (very un-Rubinsteinian) - and sluggish Mozart isn't much fun to listen to. You can do better than this recording of these wonderful works -- I recommend the Christian Zacharias recording, which bounces along with a good deal more verve and light-heartedness than this one."
5,The other review is remarkably strange,"This item is essential and surely one of my favorite CDs I own. How could any fan of Rubenstein or Mozart not think this is some of the most sublime performances ever cought on record? Strangely though in the Eb quartet there is a rather annoying buzz at times, but it is not nerely enough to take down the amazingly perfect performance."
1,Would have been great...,"I bought this adapter to run component video from my ATI HD 2600 card to my tv. Plugged it in and got picture; but the color was all off. After playing around a bit I found the problem was that the blue component out was not sending out a signal. If you get one where all the connections work, I think it would work great. It sends an HD component signal from the 9-pin S-video port on ATI cards to the TV."
4,An enjoyable tour of the Wild West - its rise and fall,"This book coveres the life and times of fictional Hugh Cardiff and man whose many experience mirror the facts and ledgends of the old west. I Loved when it first cam out and I regret never having seen the Mini-series, I hope is availible for rent someday."
4,Biased Tour de Force,"'Balkan Ghosts' is an impressionistic tour de force of the Balkan. It doesn't come near Rebecca West's masterpiece 'Black Lamb and Gray Falcon' - but it is a travelogue in the same tradition. The author, who is acquainted with certain parts of the Balkan, crosses these tortured lands just prior to the Yugoslav wars of secession. His prognoses are accurate, his depiction of ancient ethnic enmities sweeping, his pessimism justified in hindsight. But too many important aspects are neglected or papered over. The responsibility of the West, the interplay of big powers, the ineptitude of international organizations, the forces of democracy and ethnic reconciliation in the region, religious co-existence and much more besides. Though one sided and biased, it is a must read - if only to understand what influenced the American administration of Bill Clinton in the formulation of its Balkan policies. Sam Vaknin, author of 'After the Rain - How the West Lost the East'."
4,A Traveler's View of the Balkans,"At the front of the book is the Author's map of the Balkans which begins in the north with Austria and ends in the south with Turkey and Greece, in parallel and separated by the Aegean Sea. There are two tracks going from north to south. The western track follows the Adriatic Sea down to Greece while the inland eastern track begins with Hungary and ends with northern Turkey.The Author travels both tracks, spending a bit more time along the eastern track, particularly Rumania and Bulgaria. His contribution to history comes from a ground view of interviews with people along his path. As opposed to the view from 30,000 feet, the Author's ground level travels allows him to record pictures of life as experienced by the people whose homes were in the Balkans.Balkan Ghosts is an interesting book that sheds light on some historic events."
2,"Might be a scholar of Balkans, but definitely not their son","It is simply bothersome to read something so willfully manipulated through a lens of Western superiority...the book aims to impress, rather than to convey any real historical progression. Unfortunately, many readers' opinions about the Balkans become shaped by sadly misguided pretenders, who will probably remain outsiders, no matter how long they live in a foreign place. The Balkans are quite diverse and the poor writer assumes that extrapolating from their common past under Ottoman rule he can really know them. Oh well."
4,Fascinating Corner of the World,"I was very intruiged by Balkan Europe and wanted to learn more. This book, while a travelogue, was also a great historical primer. I've had several friends who've also been very impressed with it."
4,Truly Surprised,"I loved Mr. Kaplan's work - it was amasing. I was born and raised in Bulgaria, and I've never met a Western who tried his best (and almost succeeded) to understand the rich cultural heritage of the Balkan peoples, the reasons why we fight and hate each other. Mr. Kaplan's style is fabulous...you can see the proud mountains, the dark people, the beautifull churches. I don't agree with his point in presenting Orthodox Christianity as a fanatic religion, or it would be better to say - Orthodox Christians as fanatic followers...But as a whole the book provides the reader with a great deal of true facts, and I must say that Mr. Kaplan succeeded in understanding the passions ruling this place, a frightfull mix-up of races, who live together without mingling.. I would like to thank Mr. Kaplan for doing such a GREAT work in presenting our history and our habits. Thank you. Yours: A full-blooded Bulgarian"
4,A subjective but valid view.,"This book is both a travelog and history lesson. Kaplan's observations can sometimes be as subjective as his travel plans, but I've read this book twice (the second time after the NATO action in Serbia/Kosovo) and it holds up as a good primer (albeit subjective and incomplete) of Balkan history. If you want start learning about the Balkans, you could do a lot worse than to start here. Recommended."
1,Frighteningly misinformative...,"I found this book to be less a source of researched information and more a source of political commentary full of misinformation.Before I even got to the first chapter I was already annoyed by the preface and how the author had: 1)falsely defined the geography of the Balkans, 2)incorrectly attributed regional political problems to the former Austro-Hungarian Empire 3) projected his stereotypes onto the reader.Kaplan should be ashamed of himself for writing on a topic he knows so little about.It frightens me that he would have the audacity to publish this book."
2,Entertaining fairytale unfortunately sold as truth.,"The seriousness of Kaplan's opinion is evident from the choices of the ""historical"" sources he consulted for ""understanding"" the region. Stoker, the 19-th century irish author of Dracula is to him a major source of information about Transylvanian history and for the 20-th century he adds some english lady lost in the Balkans and known for her mellodramaitzed vision of reality. 10000 words do not reach to shead some light in the mess up he makes babout Balkan hisotry. But he is, like Stoker, a master myhtigation and he hepls the unadverted redear confirm his most vile presumtions and prejudice. Like so many reviews of this book confirm it, he will feel proud that a smart writer (and Kaplan is one), confirms what he always supsected and lends arguments to his clean prejudice, helping keep his black and white world in order. DISGUSTING, but EFFICIENT."
1,Uninformed,"Sure, the book is an interesting read. But it should not be labeled as history nor taken seriously by analysts, scholars, or policy-makers. It is completely uninformed and provides no delineation between fact and fiction. And considering how seriously it was taken by the Clinton administration (which Kaplan himself writes about), I feel he should personally be held accountable for the administration's subsequent strategy of non-intervention in Bosnia. Maybe he wasn't expecting Clinton to buy into his ideas whole-heartedly (and we'd expect Clinton to have done his homework better), but Kaplan is at fault for writing such a distorted book.Some of the other reviewers recommended alternative sources of (actual) history - Ramet, Gordy, Wachtel, or Woodward."
1,I would not recommend this book to my students,"Mr. Kaplan is entitled to his own opinions. However, as a teacher of history, I am entitled to my own opinion too. I would not recommend this book to my students. It incites prejudice and bias towards a region of the world that actually has a quite different history and culture than the one depicted by the author. I am a US teacher of history and a history buff and I could not accept so much inaccuracy and bias from a book that calls itself ""A Journey Through History"". In my opinion, this is not a book of history, not a journalistic account, and not a travel book either, so what is it? I do not know. In my opinion, the book has no value as any type of literature. I returned the book to Amazon."
3,"""Ghosts"" Flawed but Interesting at Times","I found Balkan Ghosts mildly enjoyable, and it accurately describes many of the unfolding trends that exploded in the 1990s in the region.Stylistically, there are reasons for pause. It is somewhat schizophrenic, darting between history and travelogue. Others may be more fond of this hybrid history / travel genre, but to me it seemed forced.I also found the book overly fanciful and stereotypical at times. Kaplan finds much of what he sees alien, but to the extent that this is a travel book, Kaplan is entitled (and expected) to convey his Western sensibilities to his Western audience.Overall, I suspect there are better choices for many readers."
4,Interesting and entertaining introduction,"Though slightly dated now, this work is an interesting and entertaining introduction to the complex political movements in the Balkans. This is not in depth on any one of the myriad of questions needing answers in the Balkans but is simply a quick overview in the form of a travelogue that gives you a feel for travelling through this fascinating part of the world where Ottoman and European cultures met and mingled."
3,"An interesting travel memoir, but a failure as history.","Kaplan's book is thought-provoking and makes a good read for entertainment purposes. However, anyone hoping to gain an understanding of history in the Balkans should go elsewhere. I have worked in extensively in Croatia and traveled throughout the region, and Kaplan repeats a lot of ignorance. Many times, he avoids basic scholarship and recounts legends of historical events. His method of investigating locales provides texture but not accuracy. It would be as if a foreign journalist traveled through America, relied on old travel guides for reference, and interviewed people at the local diner about the Civil War and wrote their versions of events as an accurate portrayal of the US."
5,Best snapshot of Balkan history available,"I bought this book because I needed a crash course in Balkan history. I am married to a Macedonian and we were getting ready to visit together for the first time.This book is recommended for anyone planning to travel to the Balkan Peninsula. It is well-written and delivers loads of historical perspective, and is comprehensive in its coverage of the many cultures that coexist begrudgingly there.Similarly, even if you have just have an interest in the Balkans or are doing an academic paper, this book will provide a great source and intellectual foundation."
2,Kaplan is a great writer yet has his own prjudice,"Many praise Kaplan for ""revealing the truth"" about the Balkans, but what he really does is to perpetuate old myths and stereotypes of the Balkans. There are no ancient hatreds, all hatreds are modern creations of the past hundred or so years. Kaplan's mystical presentation of the Balkans only serves to continue long held and inaccurate and pejorative notions of the Balkan people. In the final analysis what Kaplan produces is part and parcel of a long ethnocentric tradition of negative western writting about the Balkans."
2,Well Written but shallow,"The quality of his writing style aside, the book promotes the dangerously deceptive notion that the war in the former Yugoslavia was a distinctly ""Balkan"" phenomenon. Its romantic and sexy theory of a bloody history that returns to wreck havoc on the region paints people from the Balkans as two dimensional characters who are naturally given to violence. Anyone who has visited the region knows this is not the case. The fact is that what happened in the Balkans can happen anywhere under the right (or wrong) circumstances, and indeed has happened across the world many times before and since. If you buy the book, enjoy the writing, but remain skeptical of his theories and read other words on the subject like Balkan Babel or Love thy Neighbor for a more complete view."
4,"Fascinating, but perhaps slightly subjective","An illuminating look at the Balkans towards the end of the Cold War, with the author's acute personal observations complemented by his thorough understanding of little-known historical context. His impressions of Serbia, Albania and Kosovo certainly aren't too far removed from those I formed while serving in that part of the world some ten years later, and his chapters on Greece suggest (convincingly to me, at least) that modern day Greece owes much less to classical Hellenic civilization than Byzantine and Ottoman influences. A fascinating read, but perhaps not an objective and stand-alone reference."
5,A Great Introduction,A colleague at the Foreign Service Institute gave me this book to read as I left to get on a plane nearly four years ago. It was my first introduction to the Balkans and inspired further study. This is one of those books you must purchase so that you can read it again and again.
5,A compelling and disturbing study of dysfunctional societies,"The breaching of the Berlin wall exposed a collectionof oppressed and disturbed societies huddling together likeabused orphans in the corner of Europe that was oncethe USSR. Mr. Kaplan captures, in the language of alayman, the tragic human and social consequences oftotalitarianism. In my opinion only two writers have managed to articulate the experience of living beneatha jackboot; George Orwell and Robert D. Kaplan. Thisbook is compelling and disturbing."
3,Product was a bit cheaply made & looks it!,"The boots are cute but they look cheaply made, I found others like them in different colors at Macy's for about $10 more and were of higher quality. There is glue that you can see around the sole of the shoe. I'll wear them, of course, but they will be my boots I don't mind getting roughed up. Also, they run big, I wear a standard size 6 and in these I should have ordered a 5 1/2 ."
3,Fun with Dora?,I bought this silly balloon for my 3 year old granddaughter who is wild about this character. We mixed it in with a balloon bouquet for her third birthday. It was very disappointing since it held the helium less than a week while the cheap balloons were still afloat! I wouldn't order this again. A suitable substitute could probably be found locally. The shipping was fast and I'm sure the vendor didn't know that it was a dud and sold it in good faith. I see no way the problem could have been noted before shipping. All of this to say that in no way do I fault the merchant.
2,Didn't stay in the air,This was for my 2 year olds party. It lost all its air in 14 hours. I had to spend five more dollars to inflat it and it was deflated by the end of the party. I get ballons every year and they stay up for weeks. To pricy for something that loses air so fast!
4,Beautiful Basket,I really like this basket and am glad that we bought it. The only problem I saw was that the knit bumper was a little stretched out in a couple areas but it wasn't so noticable that I wanted to go through the hassle of sending it back. The basket and cloth is beautiful and seems to be a great quility. I can't wait to put my daughter in it when she gets here!
3,"ANDRE DE TOTH, OPUS 15","One quickly understands that the gun that gives its name to the film is only a pretext to the Hungarian born director. For that matter, the Springfield Rifle will not be used before the end of the movie. No, De Toth's concern is elsewhere, rather in the description of the people's reactions when they learn that Gary Cooper is a traitor. This theme is recurrent in De Toth's filmography. A DVD zone completists only."
4,"Decent Western - good story, and plenty of action","Gary Cooper stars in this Civil War Western. Overall, it is a solid Western with an interesting plot (bad guys are helping the Confederates steal horses so Gary Cooper goes under cover to find out who is involved), with plenty of action to include the use of Springfield Rifles during some gun fights. Although the movie is not a classic, it is definitely worth watching, especially if you like Gary Cooper."
1,returns,"no where does it state its a slim line box and the return policy is none existant never buy from this company againSpringfield Rifle - Authentic Region 1 DVD from Warner Brothers starring Gary Cooper, Phyllis Thaxter & Lon Chaney Jr."
3,Great for most hammers,"This is a very good idea; I would welcome losing the hammer-slap against my leg when I walk. But I found that it would not accommodate my Stewart hammer, which has a front nail-puller. I hope they can do that in a later model."
3,hammer holster,"holds hammer just fine, but the holster doesn't stay on belt to well. The holster moves around to much and falls off creating a safety risk if your on a ladder. Should have clasp or looped holder for belt so it cant fall off. Great concept, just needs tweaking.Tommy T"
3,not quite,Works good with wooden or fiberglass handles. I wish there was a way to clamp my thin shafted hammers. It also needs a little better belt clamp. Took forever to get it.
4,Welcome to Gypsy Jazz,"Pearl Django provide the ideal entry to the world of gypsy jazz. ""Under Paris Skies"" takes the listener on a jaunty walk through the streets of Paris. It is full of joy and expert playing. Hard to imagine who wouldn't like this one. Highly recommended."
5,Simple and Good Recipes,"This is a great slow cooker cookbook, ESPECIALLY for ""beginner"" slow cooker chefs. I always feel free to vary the recipes (using more ingredients, usually) but they give be a good start from which to base a meal. Also, we travel A LOT in our 5th Wheel (RV) and this is the ONLY cookbook I bring... After a long day outside, we return to the RV and our nice crock pot. The recipe ingredients are easy to keep on hand (canned goods, frozen, etc) and so I can meal plan two-weeks worth of travel food from this cookbook without having to go back to a store in the meantime."
4,Five ingredients and yummy results,I was a bit skeptical but I am always looking for simplicity when it comes for dinner so I thought let's give it a try. I hate cooking and quite honestly am not very good at it so crock pot is always my favorite cooking method and 5 ingredients? What could be better!!!!! So far the recipes I have tried have been very tasty. My family really liked the lasagna. I do however sometimes make substitutions. For example when it calls for ground sausage i will usually do ground turkey. But the title says it all 5 recipes and the slow cooker is all you need.
1,Not a healthly cookbbook....and what's with the tapioca?,"Out of over 200 recipes, I may try about five. Not only are most high in sodium, German Potato Soup-3860mg per serving, Sausage and Sauerkraut Stew-3875mg per serving, and others in the 1000 plus range....the recipes are weird! And what's with the tapioca? Who has that as a normal staple? I wish I had savedmy money. If this was QVC or HSN I could return this manual, ""How to Ruin Someone's Health"" book even though it's been opened."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I received this item as a gift. The glass arrived broken. It took about a week to get someone from the company on the phone -- first, no one responded to my email, their hours are only from 11:00a to 5:00p, and for about a week I think their phone was disconnected.When I finally got someone on the phone, they were very nice and said they should ship out a replacement glass as soon as they had one from the manufacturer.Seven weeks later . . . they shipped it to the wrong address.Still waiting."
2,Great Movie but---- too many dangling microphones.,"This is the BEST Walking Tall movie of them all. It needs to be updated and reissued. I watched this a while back. I may have a VHS copy of the movie but I know I don't have a dvd version of it. Perhaps I rented this movie? Anyway, I am giving this GREAT movie just TWO STARS because I have NEVER seen so many DANGLING MICROPHONES in ANY movie. The only thing I can compare it to is Dark Shadows. In Dark Shadows there is ALWAYS a SHADOW of a MICROPHONE. The microphones in Walking Tall really ruin the EXPERIENCE for me. I would think that with today's digital enhancements that those MICROPHONES could be edited out. I would think also that this is probably one of the BIGGEST reasons that this movie has not yet been reissued. Modern audiences aren't going to be happy seeing all of those dangling microphones. This movie needs digital ehancement, or the Blu Ray treatment. Then it will blow The ROCK outta here. Not that he isn't entertaining."
2,THE MAN WITH THE BIG STICK,"OK, I shouldn't have seen this movie. I'm in bad mood now. I do have excuses, though. WALKING TALL was a big hit at the box office in 1973 (18Mos $) and Phil Karlson was not the worst director of that period.Time is very cruel with those movies of the sixties and the seventies which, I don't know exactly why, don't pass the test of the years. Furthermore WALKING TALL is more a TV movie than a motion picture. Actors are bad, the screenplay is filled with clichés and we see once or twice the micro on the top of the screen.Violence is very graphic in this movie that maybe could have been an average western but that's all. Scene access as sole extra feature and not so great sound and image.A DVD dedicated to Charles Bronson."
1,walking tall,I still haven't got the dvd of walking tall. I am having a hard time given u my review. When I dont see the movie that u said it might a couple of weeks.I paid ahead of time for this dvd. When I get the dvd Movie of Walking Tall. I'll give u a better review.
5,walking tall,I give this movie 5 star rating. this is the best of all the other walking tall movies on sale. this is the original walking tall movie. this movie has a lot of the older actors in it. this is a great movie. i think it's the best walking tall movie you can buy. i love watching it over and over. i think anyone that were to buy it would give it 5 star ratings too.
5,Walking Tall,This is an excellent old movie. Joe Don Baker acts as a take charge peace officer. One of the best old movies around. To bad the other Walking Tall movies could not have been this good or realistic.
4,Walking Tall classic movie,"Researching Louise Hathcock, Towhead White, and the State Line Mob. Have been to the scene where the restaurant, motel, and the site where Mrs. Pusser was killed.There is still tile from the restaurant in the woods. The poles are still there that held the sign for the motel. Eerie.Good movie, but wish it had been more factual."
5,Walking Tall DVD,"Excellent movie! This DVD arrived in perfect condition and was a great value. This original version is still the classic, with a genuine quality the newer one lacks. The integrity of the main character and his ability to inspire others to stand up for what's right is a great theme. This movie is worth owning and watching again."
1,I got the remake with the Rock. Make sure to include the item number in your order,I returned and placed a new order I hope I get the right movie. This is the first time I have had a problem with this site.
3,"Rude, crude, but what a dude!","Dirty Harry with a big stick. But oh my, to have seen it in theaters when it first came out -- it lit a fuse in audiences the likes of which I've rarely seen. It's a bit hard to take in a living room now, but I'm glad to have seen the way large audiences responded to it."
2,"OK lights, but not happy.","These LCD lights are not even as bright as the incandescent set I changed out. My old lights were just as bright if not even a little brighter, so, it really was a waste of time and money for me to put these on. They look nice, but thats about it, no real improvement on brightness at all."
1,Cheaply Made not worth $75,"First when I got this gun it worked great it shot very accurately and very hard but three days later the cocking mechanism came off then 2 weeks after I bought it the firing selector switch came off, then the same day it stopped firing it wasn't jammed so something must be wrong with the wiring so this is not a good gun do not buy. SO this is my 2nd gun from airsplat that broke so i won't buy from them ever again. Airsplat: Not reccommended."
1,DOA,WELL MP5-A4 Airsoft Electric Rifle AEG was DOA. Got this for my daughter for Christmas. It was a big disappointment. It did not work at all. Would not recommend Well.
1,Completely Awful.,Service:I ordered the gun and waited 4 weeks for arrival. When it came instead of the Well mp5 I got spring mp5 that was cracked in half. On top of getting the wrong gun (and a broken one to boot) air splat would not let me return the item for refund or store credit. Do not under and circumstance order from air splat they are a bunch of crooks. It is well known in the air soft community that air plat is an awful site.Gun:My friend has this gun he got it from another website. Its an ok gun with decent fps and range. The materials and build quality are awful but thats why it is worth [...] bucks. Save yourself the trouble and get a JG mp5 for [...] bucks more that is better then this gun in every way.
3,"works well, instructions were terrible","Instructions were non-existant!! cryptic pictures on the box were all we had to go by. After figuring out the features, the gun worked well"
1,Broke right away!,"Great price, but broke right away. It won't shoot. Big bummer!!! How do I get a new one???"
3,Decent Starter Gun,"First off, considering the price of the gun, it is a worthy buy. One must consider though, that there is a lack of quality control to this gun. The internals are not up to par for a gun of this power. For example, the spring guide( which is what holds the spring in place) is made of a cheap plastic. In the gun that I purchased this is what caused it to break and cause a whirring sound. It is likely that this will occur within the lifetime of the gun but is easily remedied by purchasing a new, metal guide. Let me list some pro's and con's of this gun:PROS:-Good FPS-Decent Range and Accuracy(90-110 ft.)-Good ROF(Rate of fire)-Large magazine capacity-Inexpensive price tagCONS:-All plastic body-Quite Loud(Gearbox has weak seal)-Poor, Plastic internalsAll in all, this gun has what it takes to be a good gun, you just must be wary of how you treat the gun as to not break it. Foremostly, DO NOT DRYFIRE this gun. If you follow that rule , it is much more likely to not break."
2,airsplat riffle,My son is 14 and has played airsoft for some time. He takes decent care of his equipment. I would never buy from airsplat again. The riffle has already broken in two places. He has had it one month.
1,not same gun,"I dont know why your guyses gun works. When i got mine it never fired a shot, all it did was make tons of noise. Ive been playing airsoft for ever so i can usually fix any gun. When i put it on full auto... it started to smoke! At that point the gear box was fryed and the stock m110 was black from the ""fire"" in the gun."
2,never came it got canceled,well i cant really judge the gun it never came to my house it got canceled in new jersey like 1 mile away from my house i was like wthand i still didt get a refund
3,"cheap,breaks to much","do not buy!WHEN FIRST OPENED COCKING MECHANISM FELL OFF.At friends house turnedit on full auto,then the part the part that changes it to semi and safety fell off so now its stuck on full auto.then the stock breaks.A few days ago it stoped shooting so i took apart the clip and the crank was jamed.fixed it put it back together and put it back in gun.I shot about 5 bbs and the same thing happened,and it happened all day.and the waranty doesnt covery the gun just because the stock broke.anyways i didnt get the right gun i got the m5 not mp5.I guess ill have to buy new parts."
1,Bad,"Ok, first off I bought this gun and the shipping was great. Now, i charged the gun for about 6 hours one day and then 2 hours the next. Kind of gets me mad it needs to charge that long. but it was about 4 o clock when i took it off the charger and i wanted to let it sit and cool because the battery gets very hot. So at about 6 o clock or so i took it outside and started shooting it. First some dry fire then i put it on semi auto for about 15 shots. Worked well from there. Then i put it on auto and after maybe 20 or so shots it stopped firing. I took it inside and checked everything out. I check the battery and it is VERY hot and the battery juice was all over the place inside the battery holder. I think that is a joke... 30 shots and its broken. The only thing i am happy about through all of this is i can hopefully get my money back and buy SOMETHING ELSE."
5,The guy you hate to love,"The author takes a very funny approach to showing the world what really goes on inside a guy's head. It was incredibly close to home at times, but the protagonist is a guy that we can all relate to. He can be a complete ass, so you hate to love him, but you just can't help yourself! A great summer read!"
5,A hilariously honest look at sex and dating!,"I stumbled across this book at kitson in LA, and I couldn't put it down. It takes such an honest look at sex and dating that I couldn't stop laughing.The main character reminds me of every guy I have ever dated in one way or another, so it was interesting to read about it through a male's perspective- I loved it!"
5,Remains a great product,Love Paul Mitchell hair and skin care products. Great prices and great products for all types. Love the smell of so many of their products too! Would recommend them all!
4,The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse,"Children who love animals of all kinds, and especially insects, will love the Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse. Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse is rather obsessed with cleanliness. She is constantly sweeping and dusting. Unfortunately for her there are a variety of unwelcome guests that invade her tidy home: a beetle, a ladybug, a spider, a butterfly, a group of bumblebees who have made a nest in her storeroom without permission, and a most unpleasant toad named Mr. Jackson who never wipes his feet and creates a terrible mess. However there is a happy ending to this story. The watercolors are beautiful---I particularly like the one of Miss Butterfly tasting the sugar. If your young ones have a dislike for creepy crawly creatures, then this story might not be for them, but I have always found Beatrix Potter's tales delightful and unique, and The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse none the less so."
4,my favorite atlas,"I was looking for a good atlas for the orbit. I had a tough time deciding between this and the atlas by jelks and zide ""Surgcial Anatomy of the Orbit."" Both are excellent, and you cant go wrong either way. I chose the Dutton book because it is mostly drawings and diagrams which I prefer as opposed to photographs of tissue dissections (although the Jelks/Zide book has some diagrams as well). The illustrations in Dutton are excellent, and the text, if you take the time to read it, is not bad either. Would highly recommend. Zide has come out with a new atlas, which may be worth checking out as well."
4,use like a dust pan,"I purchased mine locally for $70. It is a favorite with my husband who uses it constantly. I still use an old fashion broom, but use this cordless as a dust pan. I love the fact that I don't have to bend all the time to sweep up dirt using the old dust pan. It didn't get 5stars because it doesn't pick up all of the dirt of the floor (larger bits of dirt or huge dust bunnies), even with a fully charged motor. I still have to use the dust pan to catch the strays before I mop. Otherwise, it's a terrific product."
2,DID NOT LIVE UP TO HOOVER EXPECTATIONS,"The slider by hoover doesn't work on carpet, pet hair and the small dirt container needs emptied frequently, expected more from hoover."
1,Better options are out there,"My family has owned three cordless stick vacs (Electrolux, Eureka and Hoover brands) and the Electrolux Pronto is the best. The Hoover was light and had great mobility but suction was poor, not much better than a carpet sweeper. Eureka had much better suction and good battery life but could not fit into tight places. Electrolux Pronto has the best of everything with good suction, enough battery life to sweep up one floor of our house. The best feature is the removable hand vac - we can clean up between our couch cusions or along floor trim. We have two kids (3y.o. and 1y.o.) and the Pronto keeps all the crumbs and hair off the floor, we use it at least once per day. We bring out the canister vac for whole-house cleaning but the Electrolux Pronto cordless helps us keep the house neat on a day to day basis."
5,Slider replaces swiffer,"This product is all I expected it to be. It is light weight, picks up great and is good on all surfaces, especially wood and vinyl. It doesnt just spread stuff around, it picks it up. Would buy it again."
2,Not Great,"Was a bit disappointed with this purchase and am in the process of returning it. So here's what I thought of it..... PROS, small, light weight, good looking. CONS, don't like where the power button is located, you either have to bend down to click it on or pick the unit up and turn it on, the handle falls over VERY easy, & the dirt cup is SUPER small, you need to empty it after every use & it is not easy to empty. you have to slide this button and turn the cup back to pull it off, then pull the little filter out , empty the cup and put it back together, then put it back on the unit. All in all I think the cons out way the pros. I'm going back to the ""Shark"". It may not be as attractive as the slider but it's much more functional."
4,Almost a five star.,"I love this little vacuum. It is great for picking up crumbs, but don't try to vacuum up anything of substance. Don't expect it to vacuum your carpet, because it won't, but does work well on throw rugs. I have six grandkids under the age of six, so it works full time at my house. The only real negative is that you have to change the dirt cup frequently, or it won't vacuum up anything at all."
4,Fun to use... and a good vacuum too!,"I purchased this product because my least favorite chore is sweeping the floor, using an old-fashion broom and dust pan. This makes tidying up the floors fun!! I only gave it 4 stars because the ""dirt cup"" does not hold that much, and it does not pick up hair as well as I would like. Also, personally, I would not recommend for carpet.Nonetheless, it keeps our hard surface floors clean in between scrubbing and being cordless makes it all the more convenient."
2,Only for Light Loads,This is a great product for very light cleaning needs. I have a dog who sheds. Within 2 months the motor burned out.
1,Not worth your money,The battery does not hold a charge and the item is not even strong enough to pick up a sunflower seed.
2,Dust container is too small,"Very good concept for this product, but a mediocre to poor design. The dirt container is SO tiny, making it bigger would not have been hard and would have improved the utility of the machine by a lot. Removing and cleaning the container is a bit cumbersome and annoying, and you have to get your hands filthy to frequently clean the strange cone shaped filter, which actually uses up most of the space in the tiny dust container (not sure why). It picks up most things ok, but fills up rapidly and has to be cleaned. Not useful for cat litter on hardwood floor - the grains get squashed flat and have to be scraped up laboriously by hand."
3,Does the job at a reasonable price,"This is a perfectly adequate binder, but lacks some features I like, such as a deep enough pocket inside to hold sheets I need in the classes I teach. It strikes me as a little flimsy, but I expect it would get through a semester intact. I'd say it's a good deal for lighter use when a binder with more features or durability isn't needed."
5,Great Hold!,I use this to hold things in place while traveling in our RV. It works great and is easy to remove with no greasy spot left behind.
2,Did not work well.,"I was hoping this would work like ""museum gel"" which I use around my house to hold breakables in place. Quakehold is very waxy like a candle and did not work. I will stick with the museum gel which really holds your breakables in place. I was having a difficult time finding the museum gel and thought I would try the quakehold. It does not work!"
2,Museum Wax isn't magic.,"We carefullly leveled lots of art, large and small, using Museum Wax. In a week, much of it was out of level. Perhaps it's the warm weather, but I am disappointed."
1,not worth the mess,i used this to help keep things in place with small children. Needless to say I used 1/4 of the jar on an item to keep it from moving and my 2 year old can slide it all over the place which makes a gooy sticky mess all over the surface that it's been slid over. 2 face scotch tape works better with a lot less mess.
1,Looks are deceiving...,"I can't write a review on the actual quality of the 5 videos included. What I am writing about is that the picture that is shown here is not what comes in the mail. All I got were the 5 DVD cases shrink wrapped together in plastic. Very disappointing since this is a Christmas gift. The picture makes it appear as though they all come in what looks like a nice box together. I actually had to go back to this site to make sure I even got the correct videos. What I got looks terrible. Once the plastic wrap gets removed, it will look like I just went to the store and picked random Red Sox videos off the shelf. It won't be any kind of a box set once the plastic peeled away. I should just return it but it took 2 websites and 3 tries to even get it. My guess is that they over sold their inventory so someone actually did run around and pull the videos, wrap plastic around them and pulled out the hair dryer! Cuz that's what I got!"
4,An interesting read,Therre were quite a few differences between the book and the movie (nothing new there) but both have merit. The book was more detailed but in the movie you got to hear the whale music (fabulous). The only thing about the book that keeps me from giving it five stars is that the mental jumping around Desmond was doing telling the story got a little confusing at times. But I suppose that may have been the point.
4,Smile ...,"It has been at least ten years since I read this book but I still remember it fondly. It is largely a thinly-fictionalized account of the turbulent life of Brian Wilson, not exactly, but he is obviously the prototype for the eccentric musical genius protagonist and former songwriter/producer/singer of a California-based brother act. I was insipred to try to track it down again after reading about an all-star Brian Wilson tribute concert. My dim memory of this book is that the narrator is the Wilson-based character, who also reminded me a bit of the hero of John Kennedy Toole's great rambling novel ""A Confederacy of Dunces."" There are some laugh-out-loud sequences in this book as well as the expected tortured-artist tales. I would gladly read it again."
5,Album of the year?,"With half a year to go, this album is being mentioned by many a headbanger, not just Neverheadz, as a very likely contender for album of the year. I can't disagree... I've been listening to the promo for weeks now, and holy crap, this album combines the best of albums like Politics and Enemies with new angles, beginning with Born - their thrashiest song yet. Warrel is back in great shape, with old-fashioned quality vocals. Sounds like the lack of Jaegermeister did his voice a world of good! Stay healthy, Wally! Jeff is his sublime self, perhaps tighter on rhythm parts, while Jim and Van continue surpass themselves as well. Great stuff, and it blew me away from the hard-hitting opening tracks to the more epic pieces like Sentient 6 and the title track. Compulsory purchase for every self-respecting metal-head!"
4,Wow! Great Album!,"This is a great album. I like it alot. Very heavy and very fast. I actually want to give this cd a 4.9. Only because Warren's vocals arean't quit loud enough. The instruments kind of drownd him out a little. Just not as sharp as on dead heart in a dead world. Other than that, that's it. It's a serious metal album. I look forward to there tour."
5,The best band you are not listening to.,"Amazing album from an amazing band. The first song, Born, is so unbelievable that it took me several listens just to get past it. Incredibly, it only gets better.This album, like all of Nevermore's albums is slightly different than the last. Yet they all contain the same ingredients - amazing guitars, incredible drums and bass, and of course, intelligent lyrics sung by the one of the best metal voices around.If you are still reading this, then the title of my review most likely applies to you. Stop reading reviews, and start buying Nevermore's albums in any order - although this one is an amazing place to start."
5,Nevermore`s Flawless Endeavor,"I just sat down with the new NEVERMORE cd and all I can say is wow! I agree that this is one of the all time best metal albums ever. In my humble opinion, this is the best release by NEVERMORE. I like it more than DEAD HEART IN A DEAD WORLD which was up till now, one of my personal faves period. In the past I have found that you have to play their albums 2 or 3 times to really get into them but THIS GODLESS ENDEAVOR just grabs you from the get - go.I realize that there are many albums that people gush all over in their reviews, but in this case nobody is exaggerating. This may just be the album that finally puts NEVERMORE on the forefront of the metal scene. Highlights include; BORN, SENTIENT 6, FINAL PRODUCT, and the title cut. BUY IT ALREADY!!!!!! The Metal Historian hath spoken and highly approves."
2,Ho Hum....,I just bought this CD after reading Nevermore was spawned by the band Sanctuary which I used to like a lot. However I find Nevermore quite a bit more thrashy and not very original. I like Warrel Dane's voice and lyrics but they are somewhat covered up by the instruments and many of the songs are just kind of boring. I havn't heard any other Nevermore CDs but at this point I would have to say Sanctuary was a much better band. At least they could write a decent melody.
1,More Poseur Junk!!,"Whats sup Bengal fanz!!! All my friends know that I'm a hardkore head-banging maniac, I like al kinds of stuff from KoRn to Atreyu to Limp Bizkit, I even like really brutal stuff like Linkin Park, Slipknot and Staind!! Some silly looking jerk with long greasy hair said I should check out Nevermore cuz their album had a few ok guitar parts, boy what a BIG mistake!! I should have put this album down after seeing the cheesy artwork, plus it had the horrible title of ""Godless Endeaver"", I should have put it back after seeing such anti-God flith!! I did give it a chance, but the musik went nowhere and the singer has a really high voice that makes him sound girly, they should listen to KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot and Atreyu to see what REAL men sound like!! Avoid Nevermore like da plague!! Support real musik and support da Cincinnati Bengals, who-dey baby!!!"
4,"""They feast on the meat in bittersweet denial""","4.5 stars. This is a superb rebound after the vicious ""Enemies of Reality"" with its relentless attack (good) mired in shoddy production (bad). ""This Godless Endeavor"" is Nevermore's darkest album since their masterpiece ""Dreaming Neon Black"", though nowhere near as haunting, and it has excellent production throughout. This album is extremely Progressive and interesting many times over. There is one song here that many fans seem to like, ""Sentient 6"", that I actually thought was boring and a virtual speed-bump in an otherwise stellar release. The only other flaw I felt occurred during the epic title track which is maybe too long for its own good and becomes so Progressive at times as to nearly derail the song completely. But what do I know? Check out the website ""The Metal Observer"" and you will find four different music critics who wrote reviews and each one gave this album a perfect 10/10! So there you go. Highly recommended."
5,"Buy this, now!","I have been a fan of this band for a while, but seemed to have forgotten them for the last year or so. After hearing that they were putting out a new album, I knew I had to get it. I am, to say the least, VERY impressed. The band's songwriting is absolutely masterful, never boring. Warrel Dane's voice, as always, is epic. The standout though is the guitar. Jeff Loomis writes some of his best riffs ever. The solos are outstanding; they absolutely shred! The addition of Steve Smyth is also a plus, as he contributes some great solos, too. Don't hesitate to get this."
4,Bonding with the beast,"A fellow empath from Troi's home planet takes passage on the Enterprise. Their mission: to meet up with an enormous alien life form and talk it into alliance with the Federation. It is a race against the Romulans for first contact. Troi is torn between her responsibility to the ship and her concern for her Betazoid buddy, who happens to have a problem with authority. Contact is made, with surprising results.An excellent video, exploring the ups and downs of empathic ability."
1,"Great content, horrible narration","I have listened to spiritual and motivational audio books for many years. I think James Allen was a great philosopher and I very much appreciate his teachings. Unfortunately, I found the narration of these books to be completely inappropriate, to the point that I could not listen for more than 5 minutes. In my opinion, the overly dramatic narration distorts what could be a powerful and pure teaching into a cheap fiction. I would suggest looking for other narrations before purchasing this one. For an example of what I would consider an appropriate narration style for the deep messages contained in these books, try any audio books written and read by Eckhart Tolle."
3,"I tried and I tried, but...","""If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hatin'"", Common said back in 2000. With that said, I really like ""Halfcrazy"", ""Dontchange"", ""Something"" (a Beatles cover), and ""Caughtup"", but other than that, this album's average. musiq just don't do it for me: the album's too long, most of his songs sound the same and his voice just isn't interesting enough to make me run to his concerts. But this is how I feel only."
1,What Happened?,"I was very disappointed with whoever sold me this product. My time and my money was wasted. I waited and waited, and never received the CD in the mail. Is there a way I can get my money back? :o("
5,Excellent--A must-have,"I have never written a reviw, but it would be a disservice to the music community if I didn't write something. Usually the second CD isn't as good as the first. But, Musiq has outdone himself. He is truly a gifted and talented artist. This CD has so much intensity. The words have so much meaning. And the beats are slammin'. A little bit of funk, jazz, R&B, and a lot of soul. Every tune makes your head bob up and down to the funky grooves. Anyone who has been through the ups and downs of everyday living can relate to his message. Between his first and second, I listen to his music everday. This is an absolutely must-have for your CD collection. Go out and get it today!"
4,Juslisen,"This album is hot. It shows Musiq's maturity as a person, as well as an artist, as evident in the content of his material on Aijuswanasing to Juslisen. Each track is solid. The songs are heart-felt and the production is wonderful. A soulful vibe for the hip hop generation. Add Juslisen to your music collection. One."
3,A Musiq Fan,"I have had Juslisen for quite a while, and even though Musiq is one of my favorite artists, this is definitely not his best work. I own both of his albums, but I prefer Aijuswanaseing. Juslisen is still a good album, and if you are a Musiq fan I would suggest you pick this one up. My favorites: Halfcrazy, Babygirl, SOLONG, Previouscats, and Realove. This probably would have been a better album if it was shorter as someone else mentions, but please don't judge Musiq by just this album. Pick up Aijuswanaseing because I am still hooked on Poparatzi, Seventeen, and Mary Go Round( which brings back so many memories). He is still one of the best!"
4,TWO SONGS DID IT FOR ME!,"I purchased this as a requirement for membership in a music club. Sure, I, like many others, was familiar with the artist from his freshman release and the hit single ""Don't Change"" from this album.I think that the album gets off to a great start with slew of really great tunes (""Newness"", ""Caught Up"", ""Stoplayin"", and ""Babygirl""). The middle tunes don't work quite as well, beginning with ""Time"" and culminating with ""One Night"".However, it is Musiq's awesome remake of the Beatles' classic ""Something"" that is the highlight of a fairly decent album. And ""Motherfather"", the cut that precedes it, is also an exemplary selection.In all, with a few deletions, ""Juslisen"" deserves a ""thumbs up""."
5,Loveeeeeeeeee it!!!!!!,"All of musiq soulchiled's albums are great. I listen to his music all the time. Great in concert as well, he is a hardworker when it comes to performing!!!"
5,MUSIQ.....is something he knows!,"This album is off the charts. People do not know what they are missing if they don't buy this album. If you didn't get the first one, you need to get that one also. This album right here is filled with melodic love songs, story tellings, and just down right soulful music. He is purely a music genius and it shows through his lyrics. YOU NEED TO GET THIS ALBUM!..."
5,THIS IS THE HOTTEST!...,This cd is the hottest so far this year.It is the best way to back up his last album.there are so many hott songs i am not going to name them.If you have the first album you need this one.this is the hottest musiq album out.The philly native did it again.And bonus you get the girl next door remix wich is a killer track. So if you don't have this get this now and don't wait.Peace.
4,DO WHAT THE MAN SAYS AND justlisen,"Musiq has done it again with his sophmore album Justlisen.Ranging from hit songs like Halfcrazy, Dontchange, and Onenight, to name some of my favorites. This album is the best for anyone who's in the mood to chill. With his mello voice and r&b lyrics the beautiful Musiq will sooth all your cares away. As a major fan, I can personally say that the man has not fell from the hearts of those who love his musical talents. Justlisen is a wonderful continuation to the debu album Aijuswanaseing (I just wanna sing), where Musiq came on the scene with explosive hits like Girl Next Door and Mary Go Round. I highly recommend this work to anyone who loves soulful sounds, relaxing, and musiq."
4,juslisen,"i bought this cd on a whim..hoping to find some equivalent songs to ""just friends""... i love this cd.. i tend to skip the slower tracks because the upbeat ones really have you bobbin your head, singin along and puttin you in a good mood... the slow ones are good as well, you've just gotta be in the mood. this was my first musiq cd, and based on this one, i went out and bought the first one..musiq's got his own style, a deep soul sound, and knows how to make good music.."
4,Another Great CD from Musiq!,"Musiq's latest CD, ""Juslisen"" is a wonderful mix of incredible songs! Each one has its own very distinct message in it, but that message does not overshadow the beautiful singing by Musiq and the melodies.This is the first CD by Musiq that I've bought although I have listened to and really liked his debut album. Musiq has a true gift and we are all very lucky to be able to listen to his wonderful music!I highly recommend buying this CD!Stand-out track:""Half Crazy"""
4,Yes,"A really good CD. I enjoy it, still after all these months. The beats are rich with soul, the lyrics, although sometimes sappy, are generally well written and heartfelt. A very neat combination of words and sounds. I highly recommend this CD.Best tracks include:babygirlhalfcrazyrealovenewnesspreviouscatsbestfriendifiwouldaknewBasically, this album is musiq to my ears."
2,Juslisen? Nah,"Well, I don't want to knock Musiq's second effort entirely cause the single, Half Crazy is what made me listen to it. I like the music on that song, not particularly the vocal, but the single did its job to get me to listen.I like the Beatles cover song on the album and a few others, but overall it is the lack of vocal range and ability as well as the weakness in the lyrics that disinterest me most about this album in the end. Musiq sampled a beat that The Notorious B.I.G. used years ago and there was no point resurrecting it to ruin it. I tried to give the album three stars, but I'd give this album only 2 stars and that credit is for about 4 good songs out of 76 minutes of music.In the future, some help with the writing of the lyrics and Musiq maturing in his vocal ability could make a better third album for him, I recommend buying the single, but save your money and watch out for this one. Listen to the audio clips on this site to be sure you want to try it, otherwise play it safe."
2,It must be me.,"Half crazy is the Only song worth anything to me. I'm sorry forks, but Musiq-music nor his voice sticks out for me. A few songs even sound the same to me. Different stokes for different folks, I guess."
2,What happened,I have been a huge fan of Musiq ever since he came out and I didn't realize why critics and the mainstream gave him such a hard time about his music. Every thing that I had heard was wonderful. Well that was because I missed his second album. Having loved his first and loved his third even more I thought I was sure to love his second. I however did not. It was like a totally different artist! This is probably a moot point now but I am glad Musiq got his act together for the Soulstar album which is more like the Musiq we've all come to know and love.
3,better than Average but still missing a Voice&Music,"got to hear His complete Album recently&I'll say it's better than His Debut, but the thing that hurts it is that it's along the same pattern&overall vibe.Vocally is the thing that truly hurts His cause.because He sounds like so many other acts out now.the thing that gets Him over a bit is that He is Catchy.but the down side for Him is that unless He adds some Punch&Snap to His Overall Production or brings more Pain to His Voice He will be stuck in the 2nd-Tier Bag or One of those Artists that Hits but didn't make a Overall Impact.this Album is alright but He isn't on Maxwell's or D'angelo's,R.Kelly's,etc.. Territory yet.but better than His first set."
2,Borderline Corny,"Musiq is what I would call a one hit wonder. Or maybe he hit the sophomore album slump. Whatever it was he had on his first album is now gone. There's hardly any songs close to the caliber of 'Love', ""Just Friends"", 'Seventeen' or '143'. Instead he gives us incredibly corny beats with even worse lyrics. He can still sing but find some better tracks please. I wouldn't go as far as calling the album COMPLETE garbage, it's decent; has some 'solid' songs scattered throughout, it's just not an album I would waste my time on, reviewing individual songs and quoting lyrics and stuff. I also wouldn't recommend it. But hey...thats just me."
1,It would be nice...........,It would be nice to submit a review if I actually recieved the product. It's been over a month since I used my gift certificate to purchase two cd's from Amazon - I have yet to recieve either one. I write this after numberous attempts to contact either Amazon or their participating vendors with no success. I'm trapped in email hell without anyone giving proper attention to the fact that I've been ripped off! I would prefer not to use Amazon since this is the second time ordering from them has become a problem - the last time my product was shipped half way across the country!
4,"Hmmmmmmmm . . . . . ., impressive","Musiq shows maturity on this album, a classic r&b, gospel thing going on here. ""Juslisen"" and you'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,I'm lisenin'!,"The first time I heard the song, and saw the video for the single ""Halfcrazy"", I knew I had to get Musiq's latest effort. I was not disappointed when I got it.On his sophmore album, brotha Musiq (sans the Soulchild) goes even deeper than he did on his first effort in regards to song writing and topics, and his remake of the Beatles', ""Something"" shines. His trademark stlye of talking the lyrics is still in tact, and is backed by more melodic tunes- not the usual hi hat and snare back beat in most of today's songs.Musiq's influences (Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, D'Angelo), are evident in this effort, but aren't overbearing to the point where he's sounding so much like them that you can't stand to listen to him any longer. His soul comes out more on this album than it did on the first, and he is coming more into his own as an artist.Worth your ear's ""lisen"", and I think it's a great suite of songs."
5,Juslisen better than Aijuswanaseing,"Musiq's second album, Juslisen is by far superior to his debut. Although Musiq sticks to same formula, you can see a lot sampling of backing tracks of pasts hits (Stevie wonder, i think). This album is by far one of the best albums on my shelf.Notable Tracks:-Newness - slow track, really nice flow-Caughtup - good lyrics great back tracking-Babygirl - more RnB, but this is really cool-Halfcrazy - one of the standouts on the album about friends/relationships-Time - slow going song, sad at times but its good.-Onenight - my favourite, a good ballad-Dontchange - another goodie! really meaningful-Something - took a while, but it was just intro you have to get through in order to enjoy the song-Ifiwouldaknew Remix - obviously a remix of girl next door from his debut album. a real banger, has a Ashanti - foolish backing to it.Can't wait for his next release..."
3,Don't buy this if you own Season 1!!,"This is the second ""half"" of the Season One episodes, while The Early Cases - Vol 1 is the first ""half"". So if you own the Complete Season 1 box set, you don't need to buy this. Hope this is helpful."
3,this is ok,"He's one of the most famous German pop singers and often compared to George Michael. While his singles are usually pretty good, the rest of his albums is most often ok but not as good as you would expect. He started his career as the backing singer of Young Deenay and currently uses the stagename Dick Brave. One wonders if he tries to distance himself from his ""Sasha""-releases by now. US people also know him as ""Sasha Alexander"""
4,Great Album!,"Discover Sasha's music and be amazed! Definitely above average than any mainstream POP CD you'll find anywhere! Tons of great tracks from this debut album of Sasha who also happens to have distinct vocals. Songs such as If You Believe, the ballad - Don't Say Goodbye and the closing track , We Can Leave the World stands-out on this album. Generally, the CD has good lyrics and great production, highly recommended for POP enthusiasts!"
1,If you thought that this was Dj SASHA you got hosed,To any one who was on line and thought that this was a new DJ SASHA release because they looked on line and bought it. Well as the old saying goes. let the buyer beware.Just because some places it in the wrong category and you jump on it well. I gues that's what happens when you jump to fast. Point taken.
4,"Good, but not his best","His best isSecret Handshake, which floored me the first time I heard it and has gotten better with age. Still, this one is pretty good.Geoff Muldaur is truly an artist--he pursues his craft without seeming to care whether anyone likes it. And like any musical artist, he knows and loves his music. He started out in Boston with Jim Kweskin's Jug Band where he met Maria, married her, and did a couple of albums with her. They eventually divorced, and since that time he's been putting out some of the best blues you're likely to hear. Highly recommended."
5,Classic fairy tales--and some others.,"What a lovely collection of fairy tales! People have their favorites from among the French tales; they're familiar and classic, but too often watered down. It's delightful to see a collection of some original ""parlor"" stories in their beautiful prose, an amazing form of literature that I feel is rather ignored. The introduction gives depth and history to the stories as well."
3,slightly wrong fit just a touch too large.,I don't know if I just bought the wrong size but it seems like the wrong fit. When I put it on the pipe in my car it needs to be tightened so much that the clamp pops off. I decided to only loosely tighten it in the end and I'm worried it will fall off at any time.
3,"Stay ""tuned"".","I purchased this clarinet for my son who still had his beginning instrument. He was playing well enough that a good clarinet would reward him for his effort. It came - good delivery, fast. Nice case, and the instrument is very pretty. But, the sound is average. Nice tones for the mid to lower range, but the higher notes lack sparkle. And it has been sharp in the upper ranges, and flat in the lower ranges, despite all the adjustments. We are still getting used to it. If it continues to be problematic, we will sell it for a loss and do what I should have done: go somewhere and play alot of clarinets for the ""right fit"". Shame on me for not taking the time to do this. I thought the brand and all the great reviews would save me time, but in the end, it appears we are paying the price. It's not the seller's fault - we ordered other items and they arrived quickly and in good shape."
3,clarinet,thought it would be in better condition case and clarinet both seemed as if they had been left in a dusty place for a very long time had to take to music store and replace alot of parts and get cleaned
4,This clarinet is great!,Although i do not own one of this but while i played using this clarinet it helped me with my assesments and tests i could not wait till my concert which is a few months later...this has boosted my confidence while playing this nice and great material it was made with.It is an intermediate b flat clarinet but ill recommend for beginners who knows very little bout music few musical background like me but i tried hard and is about to get my theory grade 8.Ill try hard to ask my mum to buy me one!Love it!
1,Bad customer services,I ordered the expensive clarinet that came with the leather briefcase but Weineer sent me a clarinet with a cheap backpack... I asked them to send me the one that I ordered and they told me that I have to send the backpack back to them first and they will send me a correct one... Most of the companies I deal with will send me a return label but not Weiner... They would not pick up or send me a return label for the exchange... Bad Service and totally ignorant with the wrong order... I would not oder anything from Weiner anymore...
5,"Good product, good price",Good gaffer tape at a very reasonable price. It is strong and sticky and doesn't leave a residue when removed. I would purchase again.
5,Fine specimen of Gaffers Tape,This is my first Gaffers Tape. It's basically a duct tape only of much higher quality and glue doesn't leave nasty residue on the surface. I use it to provide friction to my SLR camera when I mount it on the steadicam platform.
1,Crap,"It worked twice and then broke. You don't want to waste, time, money and energy on this silly low quality product."
4,What a tease!,"Beware this blues/rock band will leave you wanting more.This is a good place to start but I would strongly recommend following this purchase with ""Street Corner Talkin'"".That album has been a personal fave of mine for years.The stand out tracks here are""tell mama"",""I can't get next to you"" and""street corner talking""...all excellent."
1,"low quality, avoid at all cost!","I purchased this sheet set because my boyfriend has the same thing and liked it. However, the quality of my set was really bad. The sheets began to pill within just two weeks (I only washed it once!) and it was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on. Even the $10 Ikea sheets are better than this. Also the material is really thin and more so after a few washes. I would not purchase anything from this manufacturer again."
2,Not a lot like Strawberry Shortcake,"The toy looks like the picture and was shipped quickly. As with a lot of strawberry shortcake dolls, it does not really look like her! My daughter does love it but it has a small hole even after a very short time after playing with it. I don't think I would recommend this particular doll for anyone who wants something that looks like Strawberry Shortcake."
3,"Nice, but not great","I bought this level case for a Empire ""True blue"" 96"" level. It fits pretty nice, I just wish it came in/out a little easier. The zipper only comes down about 6 inches."
1,Disappointing buy,I was distracted by mistakes and typos. Book is only good for die-hard fans who collect EVERY piece of GWTW memorabilia. Better off watching the film again or re-reading the original book. Doesn't come close to David O'Selznick's Hollywood; Memo from David O'Selznick or The Road to Tara.
3,Highly overpriced,"This book is like a time capsule of a much anticipated event.One night, one premiere and it's all captured in a single book. Lots of pictures with descriptions of what everyone is wearing and who's who at the showing. Must have been quite an event!"
2,Useless strings have no ball ends,I had no idea that the banjo string set I purchased would come without ball ends or a method to keep them on a banjo that does not have hooks in the tailpiece for this loop end string set. The package gives no clue that these strings come only with loop ends and no ball ends to hold the string in the tailpiece. The set is useless to me as there is no way to fasten them to the banjo. I am disappointed in the Gibson brand for not labeling this fact on the package.
1,Where did he get his info,"Angel: a Mighty Fortress is the kind of book that has to be taken as just book full of miss information. I feel that he should have gotten his info correct. I have read the book that was written by the only man who Was blown out of the plane and live to tell the story.I have seen pictures of the plane after it was shot down. I have seen the field 45 years later that still show the indention in the grond where it landed. Where did he get the info as the man who live never talked to Mr Gaddo. It was not till after his death did the book come out. That to me is sad as this man lived with this the rest of his life. You might like to know that Some of the men that went up on that last flight were not part of the original crew.I just feel sad that Gaddo has taken part of someones life and called it his book. Shame on you Mr. Don Gaddo.One more thing I would like to know where the ""Angel"" really came from ????"
5,"Angel,A Mighty Fortress","I enjoyed this book so much because you see my husband grew up with the author and we know or knew most of the people in the book personally! This book is an amazing story about WWII and the men and women who died for their country. We knew last summer that Don was writing this book when Sharon [Don's wife], and Don stopped to see us while in Illinois visiting with family and friends. We went out to dinner and while talking about old times and reminiscing Don told us of his search for information about his cousin, Lt. Joe Doglio. He told us of his stop at a Military Museum while on a vacation and how he found the information about the crew and the Angel and how he called the men who were still living to get the first hand accounts of the events that led to the death of the crew and the demise of the Angel. It was a heart wrenching story that needed to be told. We are forever grateful for their friendship and hope to be able to read a sequel to Angel some day soon!"
2,"A nice Mystery, but disappointing to the industry.","It's getting increasingly harder to find an accurate depiction of the horse world. Far too often these stories come in either romance or mystery novels, and Kai Maristed's novel, ""Fall,"" combines both those, and if that wasn't bad enough, she throws in a few stereotypes. The story traces the same characters through a show curcuit, and while breifly touching upon the emotions that surround such events, Maristed seems much more content to examine the stereotypical relationships and types of people who exist in this world. I have personally worked in the horse industry for a number of years, and while the story has good intentions, it is, overall, a satyric romance/drama/mystery that belongs on a soap opear."
5,Excellent Resource,"This book is a beautifully photographed, well written book about landscaping. It is like owning a pictoral encyclopedia for gardeners."
5,Thoughts from someone who doesn't do taijutsu,"I'm not associated with the Bujinkan and my experience with its nine arts is sparse. However, this is one of the better books on combat I have ever read. Like the best Budo books (Hagakure, Book of Five Rings, The Book of Family Traditions in the Art of War) there are mysteries in many of the statements that can only be unlocked through practice and a subconscious understanding. You can read one passage and have enough to work from for quite a while.I had no idea that my pristine, barely-read copy could fetch such a fantastically high price, and that gives me all the more incentive to hang onto it for dear life and spend more time with it. And by more time I mean 10 minutes to read something (two or three times, or more) and hours or even years figuring it out.Good stuff - too bad more martial arts books aren't written like this. We only seem to get anything this good about once every two hundred years or so."
5,Thirtysomething,Excellent book for anyone interested in writing and television. But a must have for any thirtysomething fan!! Nine scipts of the popular show with introductions from their writers. Get your hands on this if you can!
2,I would have cheated in seminary,"(Hand over mouth yawning prodigously) If I had been assigned this book when I was in seminary I probably would have read the first and last paragraph of each chapter. Or maybe I would have written an essay based merely on the chapter headings. You might imagine from this review that I did not finish it. You would be right, for it commits the worst sin of anything theological, namely, it is BORING."
2,Dreadfully boring,Being somewhat familiar with Marsden's writing I looked forward with great anticipation to reading this book. Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism are subjects with which I have significant familiarity and very great interest. The book was a disappointment and for me was simply a dreary recitation of facts with nothing to give it life.
4,The Culture of the Sto:lo people in a book,"I just wanted to say that i have been looking all over for a reasonably priced book and i found it elsewhere. I am a Sto:lo First Nations person and i really enjoyed this book so far. I have been wanting to find out about my culture and i really like this book. I have yet to get the Sto:lo Historical Atlas as well. I love the pictures in that one..Anyway, this book is a keeper, it explains how the Sto:lo culture lived, how our culture is becoming extinct and how our lives have changed. i like this book.All my relations"
4,Maine is not just for vacation any more!,"This compiliation of writings from Maine proves that Maine is not ust Vacationland. It is a place of culture and thought. The writers represented herein are articulate beyond just their words on the page(s). They lend great insight into what Maine is like as veiwed through the literary lens. Lignell and Wilson edit brilliantly, having chosen wisely a great swath of literary talent from the ""home shore."" One can only await with eagerness another pass along Route 1 or into the woods of the state to find who else is writing, and what else there is to learn from their words. Brava."
3,Screw piece too short,"Okay, this antanna works, but I had to modify it to make it fit my car... The metal screw that is fixed to the base of the antenna that you screw the rest of the antenna on is just a tad short. I read another review where the person modified the plastic piece that sits on top of the car. I did this too, then I was able to install it properly.While this seems like a decent antenna, don't buy it unless you are willing to modify parts of it so it will fit. I simply broke off the lip on the bottom of the plastic piece, (about 1/8 inch) and the screw part caught the antenna and attached fine.Also, I like how you can adjust the base at different angles so you can make the antenna stick up straight. The hole where the antenna attaches on my car was curved, so this was nice."
2,Mounting screw too short,"Just as D-Flo stated, the mounting stub is too short. It barely threads into itself without installing on the vehicle. Just the thickness of the sheetmetal (less than a 16th) it too thick for the threads to grab. I had to make my own grommet to make it work. Shouldn't have to modify a product straight out of the package. There is no way this would work unless your are mounting it to a paper thin body (literly!) Wouldn't buy again."
1,"Yes, it really doesn't fit.","I had read the other reviews that folks had left and it sounded like this was a iffy purchase. But I couldn't tell where the problem was. The other reviews mentioned that the screw was too short. Let me try and explain, so you can make an informed decision. The antenna has two parts, the base (it fits below the fender/trunk) and the other part that fits on top. The two part are held together with a 8mm screw. Well the 8mm screw sticks out of the base 5/8 of inch that might seen like it would be long enough but the washer and antenna base is 1/2 inches long. The end results is you have only 1/8 to work with so you can't attach the base and the top together. The two options you have are go buy a longer 8mm bolt and force the bolt out of the base, or return the antenna back to Amazon."
1,Warning- do not purchase!!,"I'm an idiot because I didn't pay attention to earlier reviews talking about how this poorly designed antenna will not fit your car. As others state, the design makes it impossible to thread the antenna base to the antenna because the screw is too short. Shouldn't something this elementary have been corrected a long time ago? I really wish Amazon would drop this item from the product menu. I just threw mine in the trash after several screaming expletives in the garage."
1,Bad Threads!,"At first sight one would think this is a decent replacement antenna. However, the threads in the antenna that screw into the base are very weak. If one expects a decent seal on this product I can't see a way to tighten this with the slop in the threads. I was expecting to install this in a very easy and flat location and once tightened the threads would slip. Amazon was excellent on the return at least, very much appreciated."
3,Pyramid 1307 Antenna,"I had to trim down a plastic peice so this antenna would attach to the curved fender on my altima where the old broken off antenna was and I didn't realize I needed a special adapter to hook it up, so its not connected yet. It doesn't quite cover the oval hole in the fender, so I had to improvise to keep the rain out. Once I got it installed, it looks much better than the duct taped broken electric anntenna it replaced."
1,Disgusting,"I purchased two boxes, thinking they would be great. I am a big fan of all there jerky, so I thought they would be something like a Slim Jim. Was I wrong. Had 2-3 bites, and the 2 boxes went in the trash."
5,Fascinating book about a unlikeable man,"Swanberg was a master biographer and his books almost always are well-researched and well-written. This one certainly is. And I found it greatly worth reading though one cannot help but be appalled by the subject: an adulterer many times over, quarreling with his friends as well as all his publishers, a man of unbelievable crudity, an admirer of both Stalin and Hitler, a rabid anti-Semite, a vicious anti-Catholic. While few books can equal the merit of Swanberg's classic Sickles the Incredible, this biography is eminently readable and holds one's attention to the last page. It is the ninth book by Swanberg I have read, and I admit I read this because I knew Swanberg did such a good job with his books, not because I was so interested in Theodore Dreiser."
3,"It's OK, but not very accurate level for the cost","Overpriced for the quality, accuracy, and ease of use. Laser is in the middle of the unit with just a thin ledge at laser level - can be difficult and tricky to get things just right."
4,American Heritage Cookbook,"I ahd this book years ago but it went the ways of many divorces. In the past I had to search this out, in the library/ Has many interesting recipes"
5,A New Love for Poetry,"I read this book with a preconceived notion of ""I don't like poetry so why should I read this one"". I must now eat my words, for this book has changed my opinion forever. These poems are thought provoking, erotic, sad, clever, insightful and truth itself. I have never had anything touch my soul and make me remember all the joy and pain of a relationship. The good and the bad, from the first meeting through the relationship, to the end. Each poem kept me hooked until the end and then I wanted more. I hope this is just the beginning of such enlightenment. I can only hope that Ms. Dorfman has much more to share. A new devoted fan."
5,"Meticulous scholarship, luminous writing","In this thrilling, well researched history, Jacalyn Eddy offers a fresh perspective on the intersection of six pivotal players in the book world of 1919 and how they came to shape the phenomenon known as children's publishing. Masterfully organized, this accessible volume presents both close-up views and nuanced backdrops of women's work and sensibilities that is part biography, part cultural criticism, and part intellectual history. Eddy's finely crafted language and patient roll-out of the narrative invite historians, feminists and lay readers alike to grapple with the complexities of empire-building, the history of the professions, and women's work in early 20th century America. Compelling and scholarly, adventurous and illuminating. Highly recommended for women's history, history of the book, print culture, and social history classes; graduate students in literacy, education, and reading studies."
1,Give it a pass,"I ordered this gadget after I misplaced the charger for my Nikon Coolpix 885. Despite the vendor's claims, this charger DOES NOT fit Nikon EN-EL1 OEM batteries. I e-mailed the nice fellow at the vendor's help desk to complain. He responded by sending me a replacement part that also did not fit the Nikon battery. So, basically, this charger is totally useless and I'm in the process of trying to get a refund.And, by the way, the charger illustrated in this advertisement is not what I was sent.Bottom line, give it a pass. It doesn't work as advertised."
2,"Intriguing, yet haphazard","I think Bowes's story is incredible, but it was diluted by the structure of too many flashbacks and flashforwards. The story of a boy growing up with a shadow is not entirely new, and Bowes breathed new life in this by adding the queer element and in his refreshing settings. I found it rather confusing and couldn't always figure out when the events occurred: past, present, recent..?"
4,Dark and believable fantasy,"If much fantasy consists of real toads in imaginary gardens, then Minions of the Moon is precisely the other way around. In most respects it is a book about a character struggling to overcome his own dark side. It is the world as we know it, only in this world a person's dark side can exist as a separate entity.The tip o' the hat to Mr. Hyde in the Shadow is well done. The novel is gritty enough to have a nice hard-boiled feel without being unbearably grotty.Why not five stars? Too disjointed. It does not quite hold together well enough as a novel to make it really memorable.Good read all the same. Not a waste of time."
4,Felix Krull redux,"This is a terrific book! Years ago I enjoyed Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidance Man. This book also keeps you reading on and on. I can't wait to read his next book."
5,"Accurate, informative, and very helpful","I just moved to DC, and I was really lost here until I picked up this thing. The reviewers selected great activities, restaurants, places, etc. Each one I have tried has been worth my time, if not really outstanding. I've asked long-time locals about some of the highly recommended but low-profile places, and they have agreed that those are hot spots. The maps are very nice, and the style is extremely readable. If you need one guide to the city, this is as good a choice as any."
1,A steaming pile of excrement,"Mere words can not convey the awfulness of this particular RPG. Digging my eyes out with a plastic spork would be more preferable than ever having to view those soiled pages ever again. Confusing setting, along with incomplete and incoherent rules and numerous typos are the norm for this particular text. Books like this give RPGs, and RPers a bad name. I can only hope that professional therapy will cleanse the dirtiness that I feel from having read this book. If it were possible, I would give this product negative stars."
2,An awful game that can be awfully fun!,"This game is pretty bad. The system is clumsy and often nonsensical. You need a calculator and a bit of patience for many of the game rules.That said it was comically awful in a good way too, sort of like that movie you won't admit to watching but love it anyhow. Its a high powered romp through a weird hollowed out Mars traveling through the universe. The classes are all kind of fun to read and fun to play as long as you like powergaming and don't mind the worst aspects of the game.I had a lot of fun running this game. Can I recommend it? No. But if you have the fortitude for a powergaming mess with an interesting world then you might want to give it a try."
1,Offers insite to the workings of a deranged lunatics mind,"I can't begin to explain what is in this unholy tome. I suppose it's one claim to fame is it is the worst, most pretensious and poorly thought out RPG ever produced. The type of thing that could only be considered good by mullet headed, pimple faced pre teen boys wearing Merga Death tees."
3,Strangely Amusing B Movie Of A Game,"I got this game in expectation of reading the worst RPG ever written. The bad reviews were a form of entertainment in and of themselves, the loathing poured out on this game and its author were immense. What I am finding out is--I have seen worse games. The complexity of character generation is greater than most versions of D&D; but far simpler than old chestnuts like Chivalry and Sorcery or Space Opera. The closest comparison that I can come up with are the works of Kevin Simbieda, although McCracken is far stranger. And that's where the charm of this game lies. If you are looking for White Wolf-esque seriousness, of course you will hate it. This is to D&D; and the more established and popular games what The Beastmaster was to The Godfather.If you don't intend to take things too seriously, this game looks like it could be a blast."
3,These sporks...,"Well personally I was pretty disappointed, when I bought this for 10 dollars I figured I would have gotten a much higher quality spork, but instead what I got seemed to be a low quality spork that could be bent fairly easily. While I did not actually bend it I was afraid to pick it up, let alone eat with it in fear it'd bend. I certainly could have found another spork of higher quality elsewhere, but I wanted just 1, and figured I go high quality. That is something you have failed to deliver to your customer."
2,a little deceiving,"Just got my ""spork"" today and as it turns out, there is just one. Yes, you only get one. Most people would assume by showing a picture of four sporks you would get four of them...nope. Doesn't even say in the description, so I guess I should have paid attention to that. My mistake doesn't have to be yours, so beware.At least let me pick one of the four colors you show(it doesn't even give you the option). With that said, I'm sure for 11$ you can find a better deal."
4,Child safety lock.,"I have this on the cabinets in my kitchen, on the ones that are on the bottom. They work pretty well, but after awhile my little guy figured out how to just push it down so that it opens up. I wouldn't recommend if you're trying to child proof from toddlers."
4,Does the job - not a toy,With a highly mobile grandson this did the trick; little hands can no longer go exploring in drawers. Initially it is a little annoying have to unlatch it everytiime you needs to get in a drawer but it quickly becomes second nature to do so.
4,KEEPS KITTY OUT,Although a little cumbersome to install these are great at keeping our extremely curious kitten out of the cabinets. Because of the design of our cabinets we really didn't have to install the plastic catch. That simplified things tremendously.
1,Blah... Good idea never worked.,"These were just plain terrible. I removed them. Amazon wants at least 20 words or won't let me save this so here goes. They are bad, appalling, atrocious, awful, beastly, dangerous, disastrous, disturbing, dreadful, ghastly, harrowing, hideous, horrible , poor, repulsive, revolting, rotten, vile , cheap and finally noneffective"
2,Not a great computer,"We purchased 3 of these computers refurbished directly from Sony. Each one was defective, and we had to send it back. Each one had problems with our Linksys wireless notebook adaptor card. The computers were slow as well.Finally, after returning all 3 V505 computers, we went out and bought a new VGN-S150. We have had no problems with this new computer. We were told by the guy at Circuit City that the V505s were known to have problems in different areas. Our wireless connection with this new computer is great. This shows that the V505s were just not good in this respect. You get what you pay for."
2,Nice machine except for the erratic random keyboard errors,"This is a nice package with wireless and nice compact design and long battery life. The memory and disk are very good, and the processor quite OK for most purposes. The keyboard is a little cramped, and the speakers give sound no better than a mobile phone, which is puzzling for a Sony device.I am happy with my choice EXCEPT that the keyboard induces random jumps and characters and unfortunately I have to spend about 30% of my typing time correcting the errors and adjusting the cursor.I searched on the web and found, sadly, that this is a problem experienced by many people with this Sony keyboard. And it appears that trying to get the problem solved is even more frustrating than the problem. So if you need series keying than this machine is quite useless."
4,Boys will be boys,"This book is an escape. An Island in Time is a fascinating story of growing up in an unspoiled time in an unspoiled place. It takes the reader back to a time when children were free to roam on their own, spend an entire day in a boat (before the advent of personal flotation devices) and spend months playing Army under the house.It explains the behavior of little boys, lets us look inside their heads and see the depths of their hearts. Through this author's remarkable recall of each situation and emotion, we see his hopes and dreams through the eyes of a child. It makes us long for such innocence.Those who have ever lived on an island will appreciate the small town, family atmosphere and freedom that this book offers. You'll want to move to an island yourself. Preferrably in Puget Sound."
1,Not the real episode,This isn't the actual episode and only 2 minutes long.. it's not worth $2.99 for the HD version and should be free like every other preview for this show.
1,Free elsewhere... Hoping it is a mistake.,"Yeah this is free to watch over at www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwhoAnd you can even watch it from the USA.It wasn't listed a couple days ago, so it is a sign that we may be getting the 2011 Christmas episode tomorrow on the site."
3,Takes forever for them to upload an episode.,"I love the ability to download these shows since I don't have cable. But during the season, Amazon was really on the ball and would have the show available by the next day, usually in the morning. The Christmas Special aired last night, what's the hold up? It makes me wonder if it's on itunes."
1,When does the episode get posted?,Does anyone know when the actual episode will be posted? I am of course anxious to see the real thing...
4,"Pretty new season, but how with the characters fare?","The delivery system itself is great, instant video with decent quality after letting it buffer for a few minutes. I'm a bit concerned about the new season, that it will hit all the right fan points but not run counter to them to develop deeper characterizations. That being said, the cinematography and graphic and set design are now in the 'gorgeous' category."
5,Christmas without the Doctor isn't Christmas at all,The Doctor Who Christmas specials are a highlight of my Christmas season. I usually like to rewatch them around Christmas in preparation for the newest one. The Matt Smith specials are fantastic.
1,$1.99 for 2 minutes?,I love Doctor Who! And I use Amazon to watch Doctor Who. But $1.99 for a 2 minute trailer to the 2011 Christmas episode!?! C'mon... You can do better. The episode itself will only be $1.99! Fix this.
3,"Good shows, poor interface",The episodes themselves are excellent. My problem is that the Amazon Instant Video app does not currently support AirPlay for my IOS products so I was unable to watch them on my regular TV. We had to watch them on our laptops or iPad.
5,The Snowmen,It's nice to see Moffat finally catch some stride in writing and the new companion is a joy compared to the always boring Amy Pond.
5,Awesome Christmas special!,"A great show and set up for the next season of Dr. Who. The new companion will be a great addition to the series as she is full of energy, has Dr. Who caliber whit and is gorgeous as well."
5,brilliant show,was a great show. tho i did miss not seeing where the sneak peeks came from. but as always the doctor lol sorry spoiler.
5,Wishing For Dr. Who,"I would recommend this Christmas Special to All Dr. Who Fans!As always...well done, and get your tissues boxes out...it was a very moving tale."
5,Dr who is a family favorite,I think this is a show worth watching over and over! keeps us coming back again and again . our whole family loves the Dr!
5,christmas specials are cool,"I really enjoyed each of these episodes. The are all really well done, and the production level of this show has continued to increase with watch passing doctor.That being said, my absolute favorite, and one of the episodes I use to hook potential Whovians into the show (particularly if they're not already a sci-fi fan) is A Christmas Carol. It is by far one of the best stories told in these specials, and the scenery and soundtrack are phenomenal.Like I said, the others obviously stand on their own as well, and are fantastic, but A Christmas Carol blew me away."
5,It was a preview,"""Free"" in this case meant that they were just baiting me.. not a big deal. I havent signed up for A Prime yet so what do I expect?Cant wait to catch up on the new Who though!"
5,You can't go wrong with the Doctor!,"As always, Doctor Who always carries you through the full range of emotions. Matt Smith & company do an outstanding job of entertaining."
2,"Great Preview, Epic Fail for Customer Service","I, like many other subscribers, got charged $1.89 (plus tax) for this sixty-second preview. (Previews in the past have been free.)Wait a couple days, see if Amazon recognizes their error. They don't.Email customer service, telling them that I'm not really interested in spending $2 for a sixty-second preview. Please refund my money, they can have the preview back if they want it.Get a return email, they'll refund my money and take back the license for the preview. (Not classy, but I did ask for it.)EXCEPT: They didn't take the license away from the preview, they took it back from the full episode. So now I've still spent $1.89 (plus tax) for a 60-second preview AND I need to re-buy the full episode at non-subscriber rates. (Okay, it's a whole ten cents in difference, but still...)Still waiting to see how they handle the second complaint.The sixty-second preview was fun. Just not worth two dollars."
5,My Dr Who!,Love Dr Who - Don't have BBC so I am glad I am still able to watch it with a reasonable price!
2,Poor video quality,Video quality doesn't appear bad until I watch in full screen mode. Then it gets pixelated and often banded. SD resolution never used to be this bad.
5,intriguing,Well this special is light hearted and whimsical despite the nature and subject matter. It sets the stage for what my be the best season yet! As the doctor's past is lost to history. New bolder and better story's/the universe is open to the creative staff of Doctor Who
5,Imaginative!,"The writers weave this series together in continuously surprising ways. Matt Smith is as quirky as ever and Jenna-Louise is an equal, not just a side-kick. We can't wait to see how she manages to come back next and how the Doctor finds her. What IS her extraordinary history?"
4,Good Preview,This was a nice preview and wish it could be longer. The title says specials which I assume refers to the Christmas Special.
4,i liked it,not as good as the earlier ones but this show is so good that a sub-par special is better than a lot of other television out there.
5,Amazing,It's the doctor. The best fictional character since the tin man. That DIDNT make sense. But doctor who is the best TV show ever and this episode was really wonderful and I'm happy.
5,"Got a few hours, for awesome","Great way to fill that gap before the new episodes come out, I highly recommend this to those who love the Doctor."
1,so happy,"I am so happy that when I purchased the season pass for the 6th season, I did not also purchase the pass for the specials, I bought last Christmas' special seperately and decided to buy this year's seperately also. Pretty darn happy with myself for making such a great decision and saving the two bucks they automatically charged everyone else for the prequel that was free everywhere else."
1,Fix it!,"Charging for a trailer clip is weak sauce. Fix it before you alienate more Who fans! I am so glad I read the reviews first and noticed that ""Prequel"" really meant ""clip,"" or I would be very angry right now."
2,not polished....,"While the actual clip content was an amusing teaser for the Christmas special, I had to get through 30 seconds of test pattern and 30 seconds of the time vortex episode opener before the clip began. Once the clip started it had an echoing quality that was sort of distracting. The entire clip didn't have the kind of production polish one expects in a paid video. This probably should have been free. I won't ask for my money back though. If the actual full length special is as good as the past episodes, it will be worth it to have the tv pass.The first preview clip was better organized, but I saw it for free elsewhere before it was available on amazon. Still worth it in my book if the full episode is made available soon and has no issues with playback."
1,Rip Off,I can't believe Amazon would charge for this trailer/teaser. I should have read the reviews before ordering a season pass!
1,Don't Buy This!,"What the...?I guess I should have been tipped off by the terrible rating, but $2 for a 90 second clip? Would ANYONE pay for that on purpose? Come on."
1,RIP OFF!!!,This clip was only a minute and 20 seconds long and I was charged FULL PRICE $1.99 for it! WTF? I thought I was buying the entire episode for that price!! I could have watched that clip online anyplace for FREE! I WANT A REFUND! VERY UNHAPPY!
5,One of the best episodes of the last few years.,I love Doctor Who and I think the quality overall is wonderful but every so often an episode is so much more. I feel that way about Blink and this Christmas Carol episode as well. It's like Groundhog day meets It's a wonderful life.There is a cookie cutter formula applied to Christmas episodes for many tv shows and especially when it comes to using the Dickens story as a template or reference point. Well this episode of Doctor Who does not follow the usual path. It is unique and that is a triumph on it's own. I think Charles Dickens would have liked this one very much. It's definitely in my top 5.2010 staring Harry Potter's Michael Gambon. HD on Amazon. Looks great.The story itself is witty and it's worth the effort just for that alone but there is also a special effect science fiction element of these fish and sharks that can swim in the atmosphere.
4,the missing x mas,been hunting for this episode due to it is not available on netflix. Quality was fine for streaming and was happy to own it
1,Prequel should be free,"Jumping on the bandwagon here -- I am subscribed to the Matt Smith Doctor Who Christmas Specials and was also charged for the prequel, which is traditionally free. It may only be $1.89 but it is a rip-off for such a short video. I hope Amazon rectifies this mistake."
1,Not gonna do it...,Just reading things here...I am going to try and give Amazon the benefit of the doubt here. It is a mistake right?Customers that were charged #1.99 will be reimbursed for this free all-over-the-web material right?I am not touching the bait and will continue to WAIT for the actual show to come online.
1,wtf?!,Surely this must be some sort of mistake? I just paid $1.99 for 2 minutes? Please Amazon. Fix this. Ive been very loyal and a huge advocate of your instant video as an alternative to itunes. but right now i just want to watch the Doctor Who Christmas special. I'd rather get it here. And I'd rather not pay two more dollars.
1,Charged for a 2 minutes preview?,I really hope Amazon gives me this episode for free after automatically charging me for the preview. If not they'll be hearing from me and I certainly won't be purchasing anything else from their instant video service.
2,"Wooden dialog, throwback TARDIS and intro","I tried to like this but could not. The always-talented Matt Smith was game as usual, but the dialog was wooden and cutsie. I found it cloying and irritating. The one exception was the Sontaran manservant who had some terrific lines and delivered them brilliantly! I wish *he* had been the new companion!"
1,$1.99????? Really????,Previously prequels and short blips like this have been free.Very disappointed at the cost of a two min blip. Can't wait for the fullSpecial though.
1,A dollar a minute? No thanks.,"I'm writing this to ensure that other folks don't make the mistake I did. I got all excited that the Christmas special was out - only to realize I one-clicked a 2 minute prequel.Yes, yes - I should have read the description better, but I've been buying Doctor Who episodes from Amazon for awhile and they've trained me to know that prequels, sneak peeks, etc. are free and episodes run around $1.99 to $2.99. It didn't even occur to me that I'd be buying a 2 minute prequel that is available legally elsewhere online for free and get charged $2 for it."
1,whoa.. . . wait. . .,"I just paid for that?! I shoulda read the synopsis or the length of episode more carefully. Doctor Who is awesome, but not worth $2 to watch a two minute ""prequel."" Shame on Amazon for charging that! Happy Holidays everyone."
5,I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past...He Probably Always Wanted to Say That,"Ah, Doctor Who Christmas Specials.You may watch 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' 'Frosty the Snowman,' or 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' at your house but I like my Christmas specials a little more...adventurous.Doctor Who Christmas Specials excite me every year. Christmassy themes, funny jokes, and a crazy monster-slash-enemy always make up Doctor Who. Think flying sharks, wooden kings and queens, and the Snowmen's *** ***** ***********. Sorry, spoilers.These are all wonderful yuletide tales featuring the always great Matt Smith as the Doctor. You gotta' try 'em all. (The David Tennant ones too. Those are also great.)Thanks.Captain Whatsit."
5,Whovian,Matt smith is completely riveting as the infamous doctor in this Christmas special. The twists and turns of this young family are both warm and heart wrenching. The writing is remarkable in this wonderful story of a mothers love. I am taking this writing way to serious lol but it is extremely good and Matt is wonderfully funny :) enjoy
1,Prequel free at BBC America,Someone messed up at Amazon because this prequel can be viewed for free at BBC America. Suspect that the actual Christmas special is suppose to be listed here. But here is the free prequel: [...]
5,Very well-written and -acted,"I was skeptical of Matt Smith as The Doctor after Tennant, but he has been sensational. All three specials have been fantastic, and especially The Snowmen."
5,All New Yet the Same Doctor,An exciting and fresh new start for the Doctor with an intriguing story arc already running. Worth every minute and every penny!
4,Always great,The Doctor Who series is always entertaining. These episodes can be viewed several times without getting bored with them. Looking forward to more.
2,story made no sense,"Story made no sense, the writing was terrible, the dialog was wooden, and the monsters(Snowmen) were silly. I do like Clara, interesting character, and I like the new TARDIS. I wish Steven Moffit would explain more about the Lizard woman, their are too many questions about her character. I mean really a Lizard woman walking around 1892 London and no one says anything or is trying to hunt her down, the only one who was realistic was the Maid who fainted."
5,Always a good time,There's nothing like sitting down to watch this show. Doctor Who continues to keep this crowd entertained. BBC has done an outstanding job casting and producing this show!!
5,Christmas specials never disappoint,I cannot offer anything more than what has already been said. We learn a little more about souffle girl; The Doctor shows a side of himself that is not usually seen; and there is a scary monster. Excellent way to spend Christmas. Do not forget your fez.
5,Love My Doctor Who!,"Thrilled that we can find ALL the episodes here! Now who was the genius at BBC that decided to box the specials outside of the standard series? The Christmas specials are always SxE0! Thus people get lost using that net flicker thingy and miss out on David Tenant at his best. In case you're looking for that, it's aptly named 'Doctor Who - David Tenant Specials.' Yeah, before those specials, the Christmas specials were included as the launch for the new season! Apparently Matt felt he needed the Tenant treatment. Was he out doing 'Hamlet' with Patrick Stewart? No. Didn't think so.Oh well. The specials are good. The Prime price is just right for this. It's a rip that BBC didn't include these in the regular season DVD/BD boxes."
5,Whose on Who,"I haven't had cable for a while so I've missed about a season and a half of Doctor Who. A friend told me of this Special and I hurriedly ordered it on Amazon Prime. Some characters from episodes in the past are in this show, as is someone else who is new. Now I have to backtrack and see what has been taking place. Not a problem as almost all episodes of Doctor Who are imaginative and entertaining and mystifying. This one was excellent."
5,Excellent,"Touching Christmas episode. I appreciate watching this download without commercials rather than the frequent commercial interruptions on BBC America cable--Amazon is a great way to watch. I got more out of this story the second time watching it. It's very suitable for children of all ages and yet interesting for adults as well. The free two-minute prequel helps set the context before watching this hour episode. I do wonder where River is, and I guess this takes place after Forest of the Dead in River's timeline, so the Doctor missing her and helping this family makes it more poignant."
1,2 minutes!,"I almost paid $2 for this thinking it was a full length xmas special. Good thing I checked the reviews. Amazon, pull it together, this should be free."
1,Not an episode,"In the past, prequels and other short content has been free with the TV pass. Now they've decided to charge full episode price for a 90 second clip that has been available various places on the Web for a couple of weeks. I'm fine with auto-purchasing full episodes, but getting charged $1.89 for this is absurd."
1,Terrible,I can't believe Amazon charged for a preview. What a joke. This needs to be fixed. Absolutely a rip off.
4,Great stuff,"A great episode to tide viewers over for the upcoming season. The story has just about everything, albeit the plot is slightly skewed towards the beginning. However, once the episode gains momentum, it doesn't stop. The special effects were great and Matt Smith is really starting to get a hang of playing the Doctor.The lack of Amy and Rory parts in this episode is slightly disappointing, though, I wish they had shown more of them."
5,They've Done it Again,"When David Tenant and Russell T Davies stepped away from the rebooted Doctor Who TV series in 2010, I worried about the future of the brand like any faithful fangirl would. The Tenth is, and forever shall be ""My"" Doctor. Enter Matt Smith, and an absolutely brilliant turn as the Eleventh Doctor in Series 5, under the creative direction of Steven Moffat. With Series 7 well underway, no true Whovian will deny the fact that we were all little concerned at the conclusion of ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" and the realization that Alex Kingston wouldn't be taking the mantle as the Doctor's full-time companion. Bring on Jenna-Louise Coleman, and the feisty Clara Oswin.If ""The Snowmen"" is any indication of things to come, then fans old and new can rest easy since all seems to be well in the Whoverse."
3,Not the best,"The story was ok, almost like I had seen it before in the past. The invaders were different but the plot was the same. The new sidekick was very lively, I hope they do not tone her down, but let her keep up with the Doctor when possible."
5,Fantastic,"Based on Dickens ""A Christmas Carol,"" this is one of my favorite Dr. Who episodes. While the basic structure of Dicken's tale is used, the story is more than just a futuristic retelling of the famous work, it is transformed into a new story. A bitter, self-absorbed old man learns that only by loving others can he heal the deep wounds of his childhood. It is wonderfully cast and acted. I loved the use of the fish as symbols of greed and indifference which will ""eat us up"" if we don't keep them under control and the contrast between how they are controlled by power but tamed by love."
5,Loved it!!!,"Excellent writing, acting and production value make this a must see Doctor Who special. Matt Smith, Michael Gambon and Katherine Jenkins and her stunning voice put magic back into Christmas. DO NOT miss this wonderful program!"
1,AMAZON IS RIPPING PEOPLE OFF!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!This is NOT the episode.It is the under 2 minute ""prequel"" that is available FREE at the BBC America website.Someone at Amazon is either incompetent (at best) or greedy (at worst).I OFFICIALLY ****PROTEST**** BEING CHARGED FOR THIS."
1,DO Not Buy This,There seems to be an error where you are being charged for the free preview and the real episode is not even on here yet.Looking at it I an many others have assumed that this was simply the episode itself not the two minute preview.I hope you look down at the reviews when you see one star and are not scared to because of spoilers like I was.
1,Just a trailer and not a episode,"I was ripped of. This 2 minute trailer is just that. I thought I was getting the christmas episode as it was from dec 25. What a rip. These clips on amazon are free. i feel like I was royaly stued. I want my money back before i even watch it.UPDATE: A fewhours after writing this, I got an e-mail from Amazon saying they wil refund my money. great. I'd rather they put up the right episode and let me watch it. Duuuh. Anyways, amazon does have great prices on stuff and the best costemer service anywhere."
1,don't buy this,"Amazon is asleep at the wheel on this one. This isn't an episode, it's a two minute teaser that you can watch for free on BBC America's website. Don't blow your hard-earned cash."
1,Surely this is an error,"The other Doctor Who prequels have been available for free. I am at a loss as to why this one is $1.99. Surely this is a mistake since this is just a 2-minute trailer and nothing more. Amazon did refund my money when I contacted them. Unfortunately, they also cancelled my season pass in the process."
1,Avoid this purchase,I can't believe Amazon charged me for a preview. This is a bad a joke. This needs to be fixed. Absolutely a rip off.
1,dr who prequel christmas for 1.99,"2 min of video is not worth 2.00 dollars,. it's almost criminal. want my money back. bait and switchthanks alot"
1,zero stars,Don't buy this....!!! $2.99 for a 2 minute preview is a total ripoff... and not a good preview at that. You can get a free preview from the BBC site.
3,Eh,"Well, I've loved Dr. Who over the years. But I think the writers are making a mistake here. I thought River Song was supposed to be the love of his life, but now he's entranced with someone else. It's an OK story with a very silly Sherlock Holmes crossover. So, to like this one, you need to forget all the angst of the last couple of years. The Pond family, poof! As if they never existed. So I guess I have a continuity complaint.Matt Smith is a sweetie, of course, always a lively performance. But, I think I'm getting tired of the series."
3,"Good production, weird rambling story",It was of high production value. Good acting. A few very cool parts. The story on the other hand - did anybody give it much thought? It just kind of rambled on in different directions not wanting to ever end. Doesn't seem much thought was put into it. Left you with a ton of questions and many things that just didn't make sense.
5,Not going to make snowmen anymore...,"Dr Who has always continued to thrill me, what with convoluted plots, snappy one liners and twisted endings, what's not to like.I am holding judgement on the new Tardis, though. Each time there is a change, it indicates the general mood of the series. Don't think that this year is going to be light and fluffy. But there is a reason for everything, as we all well know. Just food for thought, you, the fans, do remember that he has a clone ""daughter"" out there, right? Am looking forward to the new season with anticipation."
4,"spectacular, amazing show","Matt smith has definitely done a good job as being the doctor and keeps you on the edge of yours seat and it is always uncertain what will happen next! Definitely recommend watching them, very funny"
5,Great episode,I love Matt Smith as the Doctor. I can't wait til the rest of the season comes out. This episode was very fun.
5,Hilarious,I had no desire to see this movie at first. I saw it for the first time at a school movie night and quickly saw the humor. My son called me wierd because I laughed at a scene in the movies that taken out of context in the commercials grossed me out. Fun Family Movie!
3,It was a cute movie,"This was a cute movie. Something I would rent though, not buy. The characters were cute but not very memorable. The movie had a nice message but is not the type of movie that I think my child would be able to watch over and over like some of her other movies."
1,DVD,"THIS DVD SKIPED & JUMED FROM FRAM TO FRAM .....BUT VERY GOOD SELLER HAD NO PORBLUM GETTING REFUND ,WOULD FOR SURE DO BUSINESS AGAIN"
4,Really Funny!,"Animated movies usually aren't high on my list of types of movies that are my taste, however, I usually find myself going to see most of the Dreamworks, Pixar and anime movies that come out. Over the Hedge is thoroughly enjoyable and a movie I think most kids and adults will enjoy quite a bit. There's much to like about this movie. It has a storyline that both kids and adults will find compelling, really funny and original. Animation is topnotch and there are quite a few scenes that are really funny. I can remember 2 scenes that standout in my mind as really funny and I'm laughing now as I write this review. Good movie and great fun!"
4,"Familiar ground, but still entertaining","The story drags a bit in the beginning, but by the end, my wife and I ended up enjoying the movie quite a bit. The voice acting was great all around (especially Shatner as a possum prone to playing possum) and the CGI animation is fine.Much of the movie seemed very familar - especially the set piece at the end which was lifted directly from the $300 episode of Futurama - but like they say, if you're going to steal, steal from the best. Ben Folds music is another highpoint (stick around for his kid friendly rendition of Rockin' the Suburbs).The extras are pretty good with highlights being extensive footage of the actors performing their lines, an additional cartoon featuring the original cast, and a sneak preview of Jerry Seinfeld's Bee Movie. All in all, I recommend this to fans of animation."
3,There's this one word I like to call DreamWorks...DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I like the film, its funny. And I would gave it four but it gave me disappointment because when you look at Lewis and Fry's comic, you can see that the other characters from the comic are not in the movie, and vice versa (I just started reading it these days). Dismaying the disappointment, its not bad that they have their own way of OTH (initials of the movie). But of course, you can't change it, it already happened, and you can't have a Super Time Machine or something created by Einstein (I can't think of another inventor, can't have Jimmy Neutron since you know it's Nickelodeon's imagination). So from 4 it dropped to 3. You can't force me. Beh!Both of DW and Fox (for Garfield (yeah! Fat cat!)) made me sad (Even though fat cat isn't involved or linked; I just remembered)"
2,"""Under the Hedge""","Despite the voices of some well known actors, this film left viewers young and old with the question, ""Is that all there is?"". The way the film was hyped, viewers expected much more than they got. Some of the characters were really cute, others looked half finished. Not sure we liked the message the film gave either."
2,"Cliched story, inferior animation.","We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and thesee-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry."
1,RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie was not near as funny as what the movie trailers made it look like it was going to be. There are many dissapointing things about this movie. Rent it and you'll hopefully see what I mean.
1,"How About ""Hit me over the Head"" With Your Message","Yes kids will love this movie, yes the animation is great. But as an adult watching this movie I became quickly annoyed. It's basically a bash on our consumer driven society, you know nature good, man bad. Man just consumes! consumes!consumes! A jab here and there would of been ok, but the movie continually hits you over the head with the message, it grew quite tiresome. I have to wonder how many cokes, twinkies, chips, etc were consumed by Dreamworks as they were working on this movie! Will this DVD be filling up landfills in the future? Maybe a biodegradeable version should be released. lol"
5,enjoyable movie,"Product arrived in a timely fashion in better than advertised condition. The grandchildren, and we, enjoyed it several times. Thanks! I look forward to doing future business with this seller."
2,"Story line just too simple, and not funny enough","It's funny in some clips but in the whole, not funny enough. I thought my son will love the animals in the movie but he doesn't like it at all. Neither my wife nor myself find it very enjoyable either.I bought it because all the great reviews we read about but pretty disappointed."
2,Fun for the feeble minded,"Oh gosh, how original and daring...an assault on suburban living, unhealthful fast food, and...what, selfishness? Hoo-hah, wake me when it's over. A hedge! A hedge! So this is really what it's come to in our culture...a hedge between a suburban back yard and countryside as symbol of what is REALLY wrong in this world? How pitiful is that? If you believe in family values, then you live in the woods. Uh huh. Right. Without indoor plumbing, etc., because you're better than that, right? (Can't be a coincidence that the skunk heroine sought out, and found, a mate with no sense of smell). And BTW, if you live excusively on junk food, then you are a loser...and you probably like this movie."
3,movie is ok but not the best ever,"Movie is ok I like shrek lots better tho, next time I will go w a movie I have heard of. Over movie is ok but would only rent not buy for rewatching."
3,Way Over the Hedge,"Overall, I thought this was a fair movie - it was entertaining and the animation was excellent. The story was lacking, however and I find with animated movies, no matter how excellent the technical effort is, if the story lacks, then the movie does as well. I would recommend renting instead of buying - the ""must haves"" in my collection include the Disney animated classics. Over the Hedge doesn't qualify as a ""must have"" in my opinion..."
5,Excellent For Family Fun!,"I had a room full of boys and girls, ages 9 to 65 on Thanksgiving night. We all enjoyed this movie so much! If you are tired of ""Shock and Awe"" and want a room filled with fun and laughter, this is it! You won't be disappointed."
3,That skunk,"In reflection of Wanda Sykes' snide remarks about Rush Limbaugh recently, I say she was cast perfectly in this flick."
5,"Over the Hedge, again and again...","This is one of those movies that I enjoy enough to watch multiple times. This title is enjoyable for kids from 2-102 years old. It will quickly become a classic, in my opinion.This movie would be a good gift for anyone on your list. Enjoy!"
3,"It was good once for me, but I bought it for the children.","It was good once for me, but I bought it for the children. After watching it the one time, I had had enough. Kids love it over and over again, though. In my opinion, the story isn't as good as say, Pixar's, ""Monster's Inc.."""
3,Comedy with a 'green' message,"I must admit I chose the film because Bruce Willis was voicing the main character but I enjoyed it beside being a sucker for a cartoon it was clever, witty and the 'message' was there without being too obtrusive."
3,Great show - incorrect information,"I love this show and my kids really wanted it for a ""pre-Christmas"" gift to hold them over until I made it back from a business trip. I returned home to disappointed children. Although the listing clearly shows it as a Region 1 DVD (NTSC), I was sent a Region 2 DVD (PAL) which won't play on my Region 1 DVD players. Of course, my kids (6 & 3) didn't check for the region listing and ripped open the package to watch it. It looks like we might be stuck with it. 5 stars for the movie itself - and because I love the Ben Folds soundtrack, 3 stars for the purchasing experience."
5,"Hammie on Caffine, One of the highlights of animation in the last year!!!","This movie is at times side splitting funny. RJ, a lonely racoon with a taste for processed human food gets himself in a pinch with a bear that want's nothing but RJ's pelt if he doesn't get his food back. In trying to get the food that he ruined back, RJ learns a valuable lesson that their are bigger things ins life other than material goods, and mainly, that is family.This movie is for the most part a family movie. Kids will laugh at the silly characters and the goofy situations. Parents and adults will laugh at the social commentaries that are riddled throughout this show. Plus, who can't love a hyper squirrel on caffine!!!! This is one to buy and play over and over again.PS. I bought this at a chain, paid a bit more than some sale prices elsewhere, and got a cool hammie stuffed toy to boot. I just love that little guy (steve carrell was perfect for the part)."
5,A Winner!,Great children's movie. It definitely teaches lessons on being trustworthy and making your friends more important than yourself.
4,Fun little movie,"A cute little movie about a bunch of hibernating animals who wake to find a Hedge where there was only forest. It divides them from suburbia.Enter a Raccoon with a death threat hanging over him from a bear and a crazy homeowners association head and you get the classic people bad; animals good movie.I can speak from experience that once animals get junk food in them they turn their nose up at other stuff so that struck me as particularly funny. It is a good drive-in movie, I don't know if it's a keeper."
2,Had to order for a Home School Project ... but ughhh,"Too much potty language and too much potty humor!The story has social value, since it combats environmental issues and the problems faced by a small group of animals after their surrounding habitat is cleared and built on .... but I prefer The Lorax .....it's far gentler and much more heart warming.This movie will and should fade into oblivion."
4,Tumbs up,"Even tho am not 12-15 of age it makes me laugh, good movie.I recommend this movie for kids and kids at soul ;-)"
4,FUNNY MOVIE,THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY!!I HAVE TWO BOYS AND THEY JUST LAUGH AND LAUGH WHEN THE MOVIES ON.AS AN ADULT I TOO THINKS ITS A GREAT MOVIE FOR EVERYONE OF ALL AGES..
5,A Great Family Movie,"Over the Hedge is a great family movie. We saw it at the theater twice. My neice loves it, my grandmother loved it, it's just a good movie. Some of the jokes are a bit recycled. You may recognize a caffine joke from Hoodwinked among other small things. Shatner is great in this one, as always... Not so much on the actress who played his teenage daughter. I don't remember, but for some reason I'm thinking that was Avril. Anyway, great movie. You may want to avoid this one if you have a problem with wazoo jokes."
3,Best parts were what was shown in trailors.,"I didn't see this movie when it was in the theater, I was somewhat disappointed when I bought this movie. The hype of it and what was seen in the trailor was what was best. Yes, the graphics were cute overall and some of the dialoge but the storyline could have been better. Too many movies try to revolve around the popularity of Shrek and not many can hold a candle to that. I think this movie is just fine for the much younger crowd though it lacks pretty much overall for the older crowd with limited truly funny areas."
2,"2 1/2 stars...Funny in places, but not a great movie overall!","I had high hopes for this movie based on comments from friends, but was disappointed by the movie when I finally got to see it. This movie was funny in places, slow in others, and just plan boring in parts. I wanted to love this movie, but just can't."
1,Terrible condition,"This DVD was listed as in ""good"" condition. Not only did it take a long time to get here, I put it in right away for my toddler, but the thing kept freezing. He lost interest and so did I. Good is apparently not even good enough!"
5,One of the best movies for kids,"I bought this movie for my grandkids, as I was going there to vist. I was so pleased that it arrived the day after I did!great timeing on the part of the seller. Thank, We enjoyed the movie together!"
2,It's Okay.,I give props to the people in this video but honestly I feels as if though the moves were taught too fast. If ya wanna learn hip-hop take a class. If ya wanna bring it over to a friends and have fun then this is for you.
5,Jane On Her Own,"Jane On Her Own is a book about six cats that all have wings except one. There mother did not have wings. Jane was the youngest out of Thelma, Roger, Harriet, James, and their friend Alexander Furby. Jane got sick of the old farm and traveled to the big city. She met a man named Poppa. He kept her in cages and made her do tricks for strange people. Finally, Jane escaped and went to see her mother who also lived in the city. That night she squeezed though the window and got on the bed and layed next to her mom Mrs. Tabby. The next morning Sarah Wolf, the owner of Mrs. Tabby, woke up to see a beautiful black cat with wings. She was very nice to Jane. Sarah even left the window open in case if Jane wanted to leave. Jane would sometimes leave and go see Alexander Furby and have long chats and then fly back to the city. Jane Became a free cat."
4,Best catwings story yet!,Jane on Her own is a precious story. It's about a young cat that ventures into the city in search of a friend. It's a very sweet story -- I strongly suggest it to any reader 2nd-5th grades.
5,Jane On Her Own,"It's about Jane Tabby who is tired and bored being cooped up in the barn and never getting to go out in the world and have adventures and be free. So she goes out into the city and finds out the hard way that being fancy isn't what she wants. What she really wants is to be happy, free, AND live in a cozy home. She was cooped up in the city too. In the end, she finds all three."
3,Edited...,"Ahh, this sucks. No, Christopher Titus' special does not suck, but this edited version sucks. If you find it on iTunes (the video version), it's edited there, too. Nowhere is it unedited. So.....go figure.Here....Five Stars - the special itself.Three Stars - the edited version."
5,Christopher Titus: The 5th Annual End of the World Tour,this stand up is funny and AWE-SOME! but one issue which is edited .... not recommend even watching it because he is not funny edited
2,Yawn,There is no wonder this is free. I watched just hoping there was some good jokes coming but that never happened. I do not know how this ever got on TV.
2,Disappointed,"I gave this two Stars because Christopher Titus is an amazing comedian.However, I took away Three Stars because it the censored, shorten version.I was hoping this was the uncut, full length version, but I was wrong.So, I kept it to keep it, then got the full uncensored MP3 version(since I can't find the uncensored video anywhere)Either way, was an okay purchase for the price. Too bad it wasn't theone I was looking for."
5,Excellent Read,"This book is a must read for anyone seeking to find the direction the Church needs to take. It may challenge your world of what you think chrisitanity should be, read it with an open mind and let the Spirit speak to you and show you how this looks in your life."
5,Excellent insight for Seamstress,"I had been searching through all of the sewing books I could find to learn more about the nature of fabric and fibers...and everything I could possibly want to know was here, and more. Absolutely fascinating. It is a textbook, but was written clearly enough that anyone with an interest in the area can easily understand it. I've been teaching classes to costumers and members of the local American Sewing Guild, who are equally impressed with the knowledge we got from this book."
5,A great resource,"If you have an interest in textiles, get this book. Loads of info on natural and synthetic fibers. Don't worry about getting the 10th edition - save yourself some money as the 11th Edition is expensive!"
5,Great text,This was an easy textbook to follow when I took my textiles class. It is very informative and interesting.
4,Cheaper than the Bookstore,"It was much cheaper than my college bookstore and shipping was free. I could have paid less for it if I had gone with one of the independant sellers instead of Amazon directly, but I would have had to pay for shipping. I have enjoyed the book even though it is a text book."
5,Best in its class,"This book explains things so simply and so well that every quilter, from the beginner to the best,will gain by owning it. It is the gift all quilters will appreciate"
5,Review for Quilter's Complete Guide,"This was among my first books as a new quilter. It's been excellent. First, I like the hard-cover format, because it has spiral binding & I can leave it open to review as I work. Simple, detailed instructions & tips for each step of the quilting process, both machine & hand-work. Includes easy-to-read charts for measuring fabric, speed-cutting & piecing. Gives detailed instructions for more advanced techniques. Plenty of projects, from simple blocks, wall-hangings & quilts. I'll continue to refer to this book for years!"
5,quilter's complete guide,This book is in great shape and contains some patterns that I have looked for everywhere. Previous owner took good care of this book.
3,Great information but not for a beginner......,"I found this book's actual instructions confusing and not through.It's a great overview for someone who's been quilting for some time, but not for a begginer who needs detailed instructions. I recommend Carol Doak's book instead."
5,The only quilting book you'll need for learning how to quilt,"This book is absolutely wonderful. Concepts are presented in a lesson format, teaching you to cut pieces, piece by hand and machine, draft templates, speed piece, paper piece, various styles of quilting (hand, machine, trapunto, and more), and much much more. If you work through the first few lessons, you'll have enough information and experience to tackle a fairly complex quilt. Working further into the book you'll learn techniques you never thought you'd care about... until you make your first quilt!In fact, by the time you finish all the practice blocks, you'll have enough blocks for your own sampler quilt!This book is definitely the first book you should buy if you're learning to quilt, like I am. I've already finished piecing my first quilt top, hae it basted to the batting and backing, and today I'll start quilting by hand. This is something I never thought would happen.If you can only get ONE book on quilting, THIS IS THE ONE!!"
5,You will do satisfy,I bought this book without seeing in amazone com. site. But after I've read it very much thank to Fons and Porter comes out from my heart deeply. It's a great book every quilter have to read definitely. Thank Fons and Porter!
2,there are worse ways to pass the time,"Flynn is ostensibly the story of Errol Flynn's early years: before he was an actor he was a hustler, a fortune seeker, a tramp and a thief.Altogether an unlikely, melodramatic bit of fluff. Recommended only if you fancy staring at Guy Pearce for a couple of hours."
1,truly terrible,"Total trash. Ignores the lust for life that made Errol Flynn so intereresting. Having read several books about and by Errol Flynn, this movie probably has the least connection to reality of anything written or filmed about the man. Unpleasant and depressing. The video ""My Wicked Wicked Ways"" is infinitely better."
2,Not that great,"this book was written by the ""Master of the obvious"" After the 1st five pages you could skip each page and still get it."
5,Black Gold,"For my money it doesn't get any better than this album. From the opening track ""Blast Off"" to the closing title track ""Dog In The Sand"" Mr. Frank Black and his Catholics provide a wicked and tender Rock & Rollercoaster that is certainly a pleasure to ride. Maybe its Black's Patented imaginative lyrics like zugzwang, perhaps its the added banjo and pedal steel guitars, maybe its the unedited live 2-track recording, or maybe just maybe its the culmination of such elements being generated by a band that truly enjoys playing rock and roll music. For whatever the reason, Frank Black and the Catholics have definitely struck gold with their ""Dog In The Sand""."
4,St Francis Dam Disaster is the best song I ever heard...,"How can Eminem win a grammy, yet I can't hear a Frank Black song on the radio? How can people be so stupid?"
2,Where are you Frank Black?,"Each CD that I buy of Frank Black's, I am hoping to hear the energy and passion that made me a fan years ago. Each of his last few have a few good tunes, but they are not solid overall. Dog in the Sand is an appropriate name for this melodramatic drivel. What happened to the in your face energy that really made Frank Black shine. He has had moments on previous CD's, such as ""Suffering"" on the first Catholics album (which is my fave with the Catholics), or ""Calistan"" on Teenager of the Year. The Dog album is a total departure from any songs of that nature. I am disappointed, but I will buy the next because I know the great potential within the man."
2,Kind of boring,"I bought two CDs this week. One was Frank's and the other was Linkin Park's. One is loud, full of energy and fun to listen to. The other one has a few catchy tunes but unfortunately it's boring. I hate to say it but Frank's new offering is the bland one. I'm a huge fan of the Pixies and Frank's earlier stuff (Frank Black & Teenager of the year-if you don't have these, buy them). He and the Pixies had such a unique sound. I miss the screaming, heavy guitar distortion, unusual speed changes and quirky lyrics. You'll find none of that stuff here. The band sounded like they were pretty tight but it didn't do anything for me. Frank, get [angry]. Start dating a teenager. Get a drinking problem. Talk to peachy peach about kissy kiss. I know you've still got it in you."
3,"the most experimental yet, but misses the mark for me!","Whenever I buy a new Frank Black album, I always come away feeling like a jilted lover - Great to hear from him again, but frustratingly not exactly how it used to be. Of course i'm referring to the Pixies, when FB used to be BF. Frank Black has produced enough songs on his 6 solo albums to make 3 totally brilliant albums, but there always seems to be a few experimental or perhaps dare I say it, lazy, songs on every album. Dog in the sand is no exception. A couple of great songs, of which St Francis Dam Disaster Man would have to be the highlight. The return of Eric Drew Feldman brings keyboard back to the band, reminiscent of his first solo album. Worth getting if you are a fan, but not as good as previous albums. For trivia buffs - the song 'Dog in the Sand' is an adaptation of an earlier b-side instrumental (12 minutes!) called 'Surf Epic', which was itself originally an unrecorded Pixies song (Kim Deal Australian interview)."
4,"Frank's Best Since ""Teenager...""","Arguably Frank Black's best solo album in seven years, due in no small part to the return of Eric Drew Feldman, whose keyboards and layered synths helped define the sound of Black's first and best solo recordings. Moreover, Black is going beyond the country-tinged garage rock of the first 2 Catholics albums to create a more diverse and melodic collection of songs, and the numerous extra musicians give the tracks a more produced feel while live setting for the album keeps it fresh and vital. While some fans may be disappointed by the new direction (it's probably the quietest of Black's recordings, and Joey Santiago contributes to only three songs)the album is without filler, and the Catholics have never played better together as a band. It may not be a complete return to form, but Black & Co. finally sound like they're on the way back."
5,ignore the editorial review above,"Another fine album by Mr. Black and his Catholics. Casting aside talk of Mr. Black's musical history, this album is a fine fine achievement on its own (the framework by which any work of ""art"" must be considered, blah blah). The keyboards are back, though in a purer state than the Casio boops and beeps of Teenager. Organ, electric piano, and conventional piano are throughout. Also, there seems to be a subtle country (western?) influence here, though if you are not looking for it, it will pass by undetected. Prior reviews mention Dylan and the Stones. Throw in the Blues.Minor, moody chords, quirky inventive progressions, make this intelligent rock with some truly great lyrics.If you do not like this album at first, listen again. If you still do not like it, listen again. Repeat until you love it. It won't take long.Truly, thanks once again to Frank Black and the Catholics."
4,Guitar album,"Wonderful variation in tone and instrumentation from song to song. Frank and the boys break out electric, acoustic, pedal steel, slide, banjo, mandolin (?), etc on this one. For me, though, the album doesn't really start until ""Stupid Me"" - none of the first four songs appeal to me. But those last eight songs are all brilliant. ""The Swimmer"" and ""I'll Be Blue"" are absolutely beautiful. ""If It Takes All Night"" is one of the purest rock and roll songs I've heard in years."
3,Guide For Life,"I too read a book by this title 50 years ago, but this does not seem to be the same book. Perhaps the author or publisher could post some information explaining the relationship, if any, to the earlier book by Warren Hastings Miller, with the same tile and the same plot. I would be very interested."
5,Guide for Life,"I read this story fifty years ago when I was a teenager. I would strongly recommend this book to all young people as a guide for self reliance and living skills. The mental pictures I formed as I read the story are still clear and sharp in my mind. My life has been enhanced by this book.On a similar note, I would recommend all the works written by Daniel P. Mannix. His animal stories are based on reality and are written for people of all ages who are still young at heart. He wrote ""Fox and the Hound"" and many other good works."
4,Reissue of Reissue,"Excellent compilation of original New Seekers material, but this is the second time this collection of tracks has been repackaged and reissued (originally released as ""The World of the New Seekers"", then as ""Greatest Hits""). Buyer beware."
3,Yet another greatest hits album !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ask anyone who had the original LPs of the New Seekers and they are saying the same thing, when are the record companys gonna stop putting out greatest hits cds and re-release the original albums ??????? There are about a dozen from memory, all great tolisten to . Trouble is there is about a dozen greatest hits albums as well!!!!!!!!! Record companys , get off your butts and re-release them please"
3,Mendelssohn's #3 & #4,"Quite a disappointment. I had expected something special, especially in the Scottish Symphony, a real ""local"" sound and interpretation. The orchestra and conductor provide a perfunctory performance, with no magic. Just another set of 3&4. Sound is A+. I find that special, wonderful magic in the performances by Lenny with NYP, Solti, Munch, Norrington, Bloomstedt."
3,Get the early stuff!,"There's nice stuff here, but most of these songs are retreads of numbers he's done much better on superior albums much earlier in his career. DO NOT MAKE ANY HOOKER RELEASED AFTER 1980 YOUR FIRST PURCHASE (or second, or third, or fourth, or fifth, or..) Earlier Hooker is much, much better. Trust me."
3,An okay CD,"This is a good CD to have in your collection, but there are a ton of other John Lee Hooker CD's that I'd get first, like Country Blues, and Burnin' Hell."
4,Mr. Hooker---if you please...,"This album is the first John Lee Hooker album i've ever listened to and I am indeed, a 'Hooked' fan. His words and his music moved me and still do into a realm of blues that I havent had matched with any other yet. This album is without a doubt inspirable. As an aspiring blues singer, I am without a doubt, inspired."
1,NOISY,"This system is NOISY... the base unit clicks & buzzes everytime a call comes in and we have found no way to turn off the talking ID... after following the instructions to the letter, it still tells you who is calling. But the main objections is the NOISE that comes from the base unit. If it were not such a hassle, I would return the whole thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Failed out of the Box,"The phones are nice but we have a problem in that we can hear conversations, or at least noise, from the base when someone is talking on one of the other handsets. It is intermittent but quite annoying when it happens. I wrote Panasonic and they said to reset the base which didn't help. You should be aware that Panasonic only replaces defective phones with refurbed ones. Good thing I bought from Amazon which will replace them with a new one. I hope this is a defect and not just how the phones work.I got brand new phones from Amazon and returned the old ones. These work the same so I guess I will have to go with another kind."
4,No lighted keypad is a deal breaker for me,"To me, not having a lighted or backlit keypad is a deal breaker.This is so seriously irrating to me, it's hard to put into words. I thought I'd FINALLY found a 4 multi-handset system that had all the features I need, along with the expectation that it would deliver a good audio sound, until I realized this ""basic"" feature is missing on ""apparently"" all Panasonic cordless phones. I mean, a lighted keypad is standard on all wall phones & even the cheapest, crapiest cell phones. I can tell you from experience that it's no fun fumbling in the dark looking for a light to turn on, just to be able to use the phone. Been there, done that, no more.So the search continues...anything else I've researched all have their serious shortcomings & is going to be a compromise of some sort, especially if your first ""must have"" feature is good sound quality because the market is flooded with lousy audio quality phones."
1,Poor reception in an old house,"I've had this phone for a few months, purchased it to replace an older model Panasonic that broke down thanks to my small children. I thought that the higher freq would be better b/c I live in an old home and I have a wireless network for my PC's. Of the four phones, one worked only 1/4 of the time from day 1. The other three phones provide spotty reception in several areas of my older home, especially in the 2nd floor and basement. But even walking one or two rooms away from the phone's base made conversations difficult. I never had this problem with other cordless phones; I'm not sure if it's the model per se, the frequency (1st try at this higher freq) or just a lemon. Numerous phone conversations have been peppered with static and dropped words. I've tried everything to fix the problem -- it seems like my only solution will be to toss out this model and buy a new one all together."
4,Panasonic KX-TGto74B 5.8 GHz Digital cordless system.,"I purchased this Panasonic KX-TG6074B 5.8 GHx digital cordless anwswering system with 4 handsets just one month ago. So far, I am very pleased with this selection, although there could be some very minor improvements. The screen is a nice size but could remain lit for just a little longer and there is no lighted number buttons which makes it difficult in the dark. The annoucing voice will only say what appears on the screen and is awkward and sometimes unintelligible with even simple words and names being mispronounced. Overall, the sound quality is excellent, no interference found with a nearby computer set-up. I owned a panasonic before this but that suffered from in and out speaker phone problems as well as voice quality. This one is much, much better. I would recommend this newer version to anyone especially when it's on sale for $99 or less."
4,Good but could be better,"The phone is good, setup was easy, styling is nice. My two complaints are the sound could be clearer. It seems a bit fake sounding compared to other phones I had including an older Panasonic. The other complaint is that it doesn't have a belt hook. I can't see myself walking around with the phone around my neck by using a lanyard as this is the only way to hook it to yourself.I do like the talking caller ID, that's a nice feature. Ring sounds are a bit dated sounding but no big deal. Other then the sound being a bit weird its a good set of phones."
4,Cool phones,very easy to set up with cool features. the talking caller id is awesome. you can make it say anything when someone calls. if you have voicemail it has a button that takes you there and puts in your code to get your messages. it also let's you know if you have a voicemail. the answering machine it comes with i did not use though because i have voicemail.i would have given 5 stars but it has limited ring tones. i think only about 6. none of them are great. overall great phones at a great price from amaon!
2,no belt clip,"no belt clip available. There is a port for a headset,however, it is not possible to clip onwe returned this product"
4,GREAT BUY,"THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT. HAVE HISTORY WITH PANASONIC PHONES AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS WHOLE SET. ONLY PEEVE NO CALLER ID ON BASEUNIT, HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE TALKING CALLER ID WHO CANNOT SAY WIRELESS CORRECTLY..PRETTY FUNNY IF ANYTHING ELSE! ONCE AGAIN AMAZON HAD THE BEST PRICE AROUND!"
1,Unusable for UK,"Ordered from, and confirmed by Amazon, the equipment was ordered on Amazon's UK website, from a UK address, for delivery to the same UK address. The phones were supplied by an American Amazon merchant without my authority. The merchant supplied equipment earmarked by the manufacturer as being for use in the USA.The problems arising from the unusabilty in the UK of the equipment are self evident, making regrettable the absence of Amazon customer service and it's help to compensate for a situation of Amazon's making.Indeed, but for the Cardholder protection afforded and promptly given by American Express a court action might have resulted."
4,panasonic wireless telephone review,This phone is a good product. It response as advertized. The only negative is that it cut off at first when the batteries were charged but stopped after a few days.
5,Happy consumer,Gave this to my daughter-in-law for a gift. She needed a cordless phone and extra handsets. She is thrilled with every detail of the phone and says it works great.
2,wall mount ??,"Didn't get chance to use unit, it was not truely wall mountable.If you mount on a wall it sticks out as if placed on a counter.I bought ATT E5814B, still not fully flush to wall but much better.MB"
3,Not as good as advertised,The Base SPEAKER PHONE does not satisfy ME (or) most of those whom I speak with in that mode
4,really great,I really like this phone the only thing i don't like is the keys don't light up so you can't dial in the dark except for that the phone is great love the battery pack. love the coping of phone numbers.
3,Records hang-ups,"This phone had to go back. It had a couple of annoying features that I just didn't feel like I could live with. The first was that it records every single missed call, regardless of whether or not the person left a message. That means if you got 18 calls and three people left messages, you will have to listen to 15 recordings of dead air. Huge waste of time. The other thing I didn't like about this phone is that there is no digital display to tell you how many messages you have, just a little red arrow that flashes when there is one or more message. I can live with that, but not with all the recordings of dead air."
1,PASS,"This phone system has lots of issues. Its batteries dont hold a good charge, the phones did not work properly and I ended up junking it to the goodwill. There are so many better options out there for the same price that are much more updated."
1,I received phone in very bad shape - The product is in very bad shape,This phone sucks.. Looks like some body used this very well and looks like played like a toy..I didn't receive all the devices. I am suppose to receive the 4 chargers but i received only three.Please don't fall for this cheap price and its not even worth trying and don't waste you time and moneyI am returning my device..
1,Phone konked out after only a year!,"I hate this phone! I am angry that after making over a hundred dollar investment. that less than a year later, this phone is useless. Actually, it was useless many, many months ago, but I have just gotten to the point that I am admitting that it is. I started having problems with one of the handsets about 4 months after purchase, and it seemed that it wouldn't hold a charge. Purchased another rechargeable battery, and now ANOTHER handset has the same problem. Started out with good clarity, but now all handsets have a lot of static. In this economy, $100 + is a lot of money to spend on a phone system that isn't used 24/7, and that conks out in a year."
2,DEFICIENT,"The telephone doesn't work correctly, it looses the signal when you are 30 feet away from base, and cuts the voice you are sending/receiving."
4,Good but not perfect,"Better than my old 2.4 ghz phones. Less interference with Wifi. However, some key features are left out. The keys don't glow, so I'm always hitting the wrong keys when it's dark. There are no quick dial keys, so you have to search in the phone book for the stored numbers.I haven't tested the answering machine. Long battery life."
5,Answer Telephone plus Three Additional Handsets,"This telephone meets my father-in-law's needs. The volume on the handset is not quite as loud as I had hoped for since he is hard of hearing, but I showed him how to use the speaker on the handset - and that meets his needs. The slow talk feature (manual says it will slow down the conversation to add clarity) does not seam to add anything noticeable to me. Overall the product and price meets what I was hunting for."
4,Its fine,The phone works fine. I got a referb and there is one bug. It always shows that I have a new message in voice mail. Thats not a problem anyway since I dont use the phones answering machine. The only other complaint I have is that if you save a number into quick dial on one headset it doest save to all the others.
5,great buy,have had phones for awhile now and they work great. Easy to set up (let kid do it) so far real good even going outside and up the street good deal and great price!
4,Panasonic Phone System,"Panasonic KX-TG6074B 5.8 GHz Digital Cordless Answering System with 4 HandsetsThis system replaced everything I currently had in the house (phones, answering machines and etc). I'm very happy with the system. However the Answering Machine Greeting is a little garbled. I knew this before I bought the system so no big deal. Time will tell how long it holds up for I keep things forever."
5,Panasonic KX-TG6074B Cordless Telephone,"I love these phones. First the ease of use. They are very easy to use and program. Just follow the on-screne instructions. I love the way you can program one phone and send the new number, or the entire phone book to the other phones.Second, it is so nice to have a phone in rooms where there might not be an outlet. Only the base unit needs a phone jack.Third, the sound quality is very clear.I wish the different ring tones would work for different callers similar to the cell phone unique call tones. This only works with the caller ID subscription."
1,Disappointing,"The phone was OK in the beginning, then we started noticing problems. The base unit started making crackling sounds whenever one of the remote phones was used. Then less than a year after the purchase, the AC adaptor for one of the remote chargers stopped working.. A month later, another ac adaptor stopped working.. So 2 out of 3 ac adaptors stopped working!! The 3rd remote charger and the base charger are still working.... so far!!Buy something else."
3,pathetic short range,"This is a good phone with very good voice clarity, if not for the range.Base unit in our living room the range can't even reach my bedroom which is in the 2nd floor or our house, what's the use of a cordless phone if it can't even reach my bedroom?Anybody can recommend a better unit that has better range?"
4,Dave inn Corpus Christi,"Product was as advertised, arrived in a timely fashion and works fine. The built in voice announcer is vastly improved over earlier models -- you can actually understand it!Very satisfied with product and vendor."
4,Problem free phone,"I purchased this phone set to replace two cordless phones with dying batteries.My wife and I have used the phone for several months without incident. The batteries seem to last a full day off the base, and we have not had any problems with interference.The speakerphone on the main base works very well.We use the phones mostly for making and receiving calls, they work flawlessly for those purposes."
4,Solid Phone,I love this phone! It replaces a Uniden set that every once in a while would lose it's ability to communicate. The phone would ring but when you picked it up you could not hear anyone and the caller could not hear you. Since I have had this Panasonic system I have had NO problems! If the keys were backlit it would have gotten 5 stars!
1,Phone echos big time - DO NOT BUY,"Do yourself and do not waste your money. Voice echos big time in this phone. Meaning you can hear your own voice echoing back to you while speaking on the handset. It is extremely frustating. I had seen a similar complain but it was only one person making such complain, so I thought it is probably a one off situation. But it is not. Panasonic support has not been able to solve the problem. I will be returning this phone at my own expense and probably will have to pay some restocking fee...not sure. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. There are plenty of other choices. I am very disappointed with Panasonic...it is so clearly echoing...how come it passed quality control."
5,Very efficient.,"We've had system for several weeks now and all is working very well. Especially like the verbal announcing identifying the caller.The reception is good. Also liked the ""quick"" delivery after ordering.Others had recommended Panasonic and so far we're pleased with the system."
4,Good system,"This is an affordable, practical set that allows to communicate up to 4 stations or keep one or two units as a backup. The older one was useful for four years, so we bought the newest edition, same line. Great overall."
1,Panasonic Phone - Don't Bother,"Just a warning: the adapters go bad on these units. I had two go bad within six months and another within a year of purchase. Panasonic sent two replacement adapters but refused to send the third. Very frustrating to deal with. Customer service was a joke. All the reps told me different things. One minute they could not find the receipt I had faxed with the first replacement request and the next rep found it with no problem. I have had $10 phones work better for longer.I usually do not post comments but thought perhaps I could warn someone else to not waste their time or money. Interesting, the replacement adapters were on back order for more than 4 months - think anyone else was having problems?"
5,Great Product,"We got this product to replace an older cordless phone/answering machine that had simply worn out. We have really liked the performance and features of the Panasonic KX-TG6074B. Messages are accessible from any handset, so you don't have to go to wherever the answering machine is physically located to retreive your messages. Every handset has a speaker phone, which is also great when relatives call or when you need to have more than one person talking on the line at once. Call quality is crystal clear. I would highly recommend the product."
4,Good phones at a good price,"I've been using these phones for about a month. They are easy to use and light enough to stick in a pocket to carry. The range is very good. The only thing I do not like is the number of new messages is not indicated, just a light to show there are messages. The voice quality is quite good and the price was great for 4 phones. I would purchase them again."
5,Fantastic Phone!,This phone is fantastic! My mother is hard of hearing and this phone has improved her ability to talk on the phone. She loves it!
3,Description,"He'd shattered every one of her defensesEven at their first meeting, Roxana had feared Marcus Fleming. But she had fallen in love with him anyway -- a dynamic man whose life-style would be severely hampered by her blindness.""I won't hurt you, Roxy,"" Marcus had said. ""Before that happens, I'll get out of your life--if that's what you want.""Roxy knew in her heart it wasn't what she wanted, far from it. But for Marcus's sake it had to be..."
2,A shame,"I'll make this short and sweet: If you like the new Shadows Fall: Art of Balance, you'll probably like this quite a bit. I did NOT like the new Shadows Fall; and thus, only two stars. The musicians are undoubtedly talented, but they opt to play generic, standby metal that sounds like In Flames guitars mixed with harsh and clean vocals. The clean vocals are bad, just like Shadows Fall. It's a shame: a couple of years ago I might have really liked this. But now, it sounds like a heavy metal parody."
2,Get the demo,"I saw these guys at a New Jersey Metal festival a couple years ago, and they kicked... I got their demo, which is just incredible. It's an almost perfect mix (in my opinion) of old school thrash and the melodic death metal sound. Raw, rebellious, and sometimes downright scary.Having said that, I was not nearly as impressed with this album. To me, the spirit is gone. I don't know if the producer made them record so much that they lost their spark or what. Maybe they said such a high standard on their demo that anything else might seem average.Anyway, see if you can get your hands on the demo... their cover of ""The Trooper"" is great, but all of the original stuff is great, too."
1,worst thing I've ever heard.,"Stay away from this. Please. By all means necessary. You might think I have a personal vendetta against these guys, which is correct. I can't stand them on a personal or musical level. A bunch of posers. You know who I am."
4,YANKS DO IN FLAMES!!!,"Pretty cool. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Nothing new. Still good though. Highlight track - Mourning in Magenta- Its good. Better than In Flames in some points, completely different in others. Its basically an American In Flames, but the guys have a had a few more guitar lessons! Hehe. More impressive on the leads, and the rhythms are pretty good too. Thats enough guitar talk for now! With this being a first release and the band being realtively small, it still has the distinct odour or being a bit amateur. Production and some of the writing etc. No offence meant by that, its just the vibe I get. Although I can't help thinking thats just some stigma Ive subconsciously attached because I know they are just starting out. If you are a fan of the whole Gothenberg melodic death scene (particularly In Flames), buy it, it might not become your new favourite cd (its no Wages of Sin) but you wont regret it."
4,a real good read,"this book will introduce the reader to just how the special forces operated during viet nam. the book is geared towards younger audiences, but has good plot development and well rounded characters. one thing i thought was nice was that the book combated the myth of what the special forces are (teachers)and just how secretive they could be. This book is a lead in to the next three books (there may be more but i dont know about them). it is a good story and a good read."
2,Poorly written,"There are so many examples of gratuitous name dropping in this ""biography"" that it is indeed a chore to get through it. As a fan of much of De Niro's work, I also realize he has made some poor role choices but Baxter has little to say that is positive. I learned some details regarding De Niro's early life and training that were somewhat interesting so I give it 2 stars for that but it seems that a better biography with more balance might be a better choice for the general reader. Actually then later chapters seem rushed as if Baxter was more concerned about hitting a deadline than producing a good and balanced book."
1,An awful waste of time..,"I have read worse biographies I am sure but I have never been compelled to actually post a review anywhere.The early years actually offer some promise but just as the author accuses De Niro of taking the money and running after a good start, the author does exactly the same by completely fudging the facts from the 80's onwards..his ""critique"" of Analyse This and Meet the Parents are so acidic you can almost hear the gritted teeth as he admitted to the box office success..Anyway its a hack job not worthy of parting with cash for..an unspeakably nasty piece of work..and the book is pretty rubbish too."
2,Disappointing,"Baxter certainly doesn't seem to be in love with his subject! Reading this book, you would think that De Niro has only made a couple of decent films.While De Niro has certainly made his share of lemons, the talent of the man only comes out sporadically in this biography and you don't get a sense of what he is really like.I wouldn't recommend it."
1,not happy w/ shipment time!,"I ordered these items over 2 weeks ago and initially was offered the ""super saver shipent"" option... when i didn't recieve them in a timely manner i changed it to the 3 to 5 business days option and have yet to recieve them. I do not know what the problem is and would like an answer!"
4,CLASSIC BUT,THIS WOULD PROBABLY ONLY APPEAL TO AMC FANS WHO LIKE A LITTLE CHANGE IN THEIR MOVIE DIET...I DONT KNOW ABOUT BUYING IT CATCH IT LATE AT NIGHT ON BRAVO OR SOMETHING...
3,Finest hour???,"Like watching a train wreck in sloooow motion. If this was Rip Torn's finest hour, I'd hate to see his nadir.Reviewed by Kathie Freeman."
1,The Prostate - Everything You Need to Know,"This book is one of the worst examples of an apparently authoritative work I have ever heard of. It has numerous factual errors and has a significant bias toward surgery which may mislead patients into a treatment modality that may be inappropriate for them. The statistics on cure rates for radiology and surgery are roughly the same, a fact which this author, despite his pose as a knowledgeable surgeon, chooses to ignore. Save your money and read an authoritative work on ALL the options for treatment of prostate cancer at:http://www.phoenix5.org/Basics/DPprimer0918.htmlAlso, while you are at the Phoenix5 website, page around to obtain the best information on the Net regarding impotence and sexual issues in regard to prostate cancer. There are also alot of first person stories and essays, plus resources such as an interactive glossary and reliable information regarding treatment options for impotence."
5,Just a great book to have in the library! Must have!,"There just seems to be so much to learn with VB.NET and the .NET Framework to do things you've always done in VB or VBScript or any other language. Sure, you could go search for it, but just pick up this book. It'll save you hours and hours of hassle! This has been my most valuable book. Buy now!"
2,Visual Basic .Net Programmers Cookbook,"As .Net matures, I expected this ""cookbook"" to measure up to the Culinary Institute of America's cookbook or at least to equal Julia Child's ""Mastering the art of French Cooking"". Instead, this book is more like a text for Betty Crocker'shome-ec course - Cooking 101. I could not find a single 'recipie' not previously published in the many books that MacDonald Credits. My advice to a would-be author, keep MacDonald's format, it's very good, but climb above the basics and give us some real-world (application level) receipes."
1,Baked Code?,"FYI, when using the code in Chapter 8-4, ""8.4 Ping an IP Address"", all seems well and you get the different ping times in your console window. However, I referenced the dll provided in the sample code in a fresh application, and used it to ping ONE ip address several times (which was a machine on my same network segment sitting about 3 feet from me) and I got the SAME EXACT responses as the sample app did, which ""SUPPOSEDLY"" was pinging yahoo.com, SETI.com, and the local loopback address. In fact, no matter what ip addresses I tried to ping, the ping times were always the same approximate numbers. I would say that the only explanation for this is that the generation of the numbers is hard-coded into the dll, rather than being actual ping times. I would love to hear the explanation for this..."
4,Crystalization of Nature,"Susanna takes you on a whirl wind trip into the depths and colors of crystal, shadows and reflections. Until I bought this book, I never viewed any of Susanna's artwork, but I took a chance since I am so moved by flowers in crystal. Upon reading this book, I am even more moved and excited. Susanna has a way of describing the necessary steps to develop crystaline artwork in a user friendly manner. I had no fear to go out to my backyard with my crystal vases and take dozens of rolls of film that I want to translate to paintings. I was convinced to use bright and bold colors by her demonstrations, colors that have often intimated me. Susanna's paintings of crystal and flowers want you to ""Ting"" them to see if they are real or just an image on paper. Her demonstrations are easy to follow and I was surprised by the outcomes. She lead me on a path of success. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in painting crystal, reflections and flowers."
5,painting crystal and Flowers in Watercolor,I am very pleased with the book. Suzanna Spann is a very good artist and has new ideas for helping the new watercolor artist. I give it a 5 star review and also the seller. Judy Jellison
4,This is a great book!,"I just loved this book! It has wonderful ideas on gift making and giving that aren't cheap or ""cheesy"". There is something to make for everyone on your gift list. It has been photographed beautifully and the directions are clear and concise. I highly recommend this book"
4,Excellent,"Ideas galore, was a big help in decorating this year. With the need for new ideas sometimes something old is made new again"
3,"Nice Pants, Pocket too short",Bought these pants all excited to be able to put my cell phone in the extra side pocket. The pocket snaps shut which would be awesome to keep the phone safe and in place. The problem is the pocket is so short an iPhone or I assume any other normal common touch screen phone will not fit in there. This made the whole good concept fail. How stupid!
4,great fit,Great fit. Tough. good pocket depth. Would definitely buy more if needed. Great work pants. nice amount of give in the knee area.
2,Shame on the Dickies Company!,"Shame on the Dickies manufacturing company for poor quality control. Dickies has not taught their factories overseas to measure properly. I ordered a pair of ""Industrial Multi Use pants"" in size 32X34 from a Amazon retailer. When they arrived I tried them on and noticed they seemed short. So I measured the inseam and it is 33, not 34. For a tall and skinny llike man like me it is near impossible to find khaki or chino style pants in 34 or longer length. If you go to wal -mart to buy Dickies pants or any khaki style pants you will find that wal-mart does not belive there are any skinny men with long legs, so they only sell 32X32 inch length. Same goes for target. So I have to resort to buying my pants online. I like Dickies pants but they are not as advertized as far as the sizes go. Some people have voiced similar complaints on the waist sizes. Dickies company get your act together! Mike"
3,Good but dull,"Dickies are really good products. I only gave 3 here because the color has no life (I know I chose it and they are work pants) and the pockets need to be deeper. Outside of that you've got the usual Dickies, tough, easy to care for, wrinkle resistant, easy to iron."
4,Birdy really,"Birdy really lets Peter Gabriel show off his skills as a keyboardist (he played his first keyboard an Accodian on the Genesis album Trespass), his playing is all over here. This was Gabriels first time delving deeply into instrumentals (he wrote and played previously only on the Genesis tracks After The Ordeal and Silent Sorrow On Empty Boats as well as Start from his own third album) and he really shows why hes as much a musician/arranger as he is a Singer/Songwriter. The only drawback is that this album lifts musically quite a bit from his former work."
5,No Way Out,"The cover of the album typifies the music inside; the coldness within the soul when the mind is pushed to the brink of madness while fighting in a war.Released in March 1985, Peter Gabriel - who is working with producer Daniel Lanois for the first time - utilizes 12 instrumental tracks to convey various themes from the movie, though they are also solid stand alone numbers. There are seven new compositions, with the remaining utilizing instrumental sections from previously-released songs.Though haunting and introspective, there is an artistic elegance in the vision that Gabriel weaves in each powerful soundscape."
2,The only Gabriel's album that I don't like,"Yes the music is great but I am a long time fan of PG and one thing I like is his voice ! This album is for really die hard fans or completist.I am a die hard fan and I still don't like it. I'll give this one to a good friend of mine, hope he'll listen to it more than I did."
5,A Must-Have for Creatives,"Petrula pours herself heart and soul into insipiration=ideas' pages. From its loud purple and orange cover to its innovative page layout and design, inspiration=ideas is stuffed with creative samples-posters, packaging, book jackets, logos, illustrations-inspirational photographs, honest advice, text and quotes. Inspiration=ideas is an essential reference for creative types-designers, art directors, illustrators, photographers and writers. Or anyone who has a care to be pushed and inspired.An intoxicating read, inspiration=ideas is frequently off my shelf and in my hands-right where it belongs."
2,Not as useful as I'd hoped.,"I think everyone in the creative field at some point asks how they can be more inspired. From the online thumbnail, this book looks like a great tool. Unfortunately, as I was reading it, my reaction was, ""meh."" The first third of this book profiles graphic design professionals (some I'd heard of, many I haven't) and these designers' personal take on creativity. A few of the inspiration sources were appealing, but honestly, many cited writers or artists who seem unfamiliar, dated, or obscure. The majority of the book features lots of white space with vignettes of travel photographs. I personally didn't get much out of them. None of them are provided as useable, digital resources. The book ends with scans of several letters from the 1980's to another designer (Rick Tharp), who doesn't seem to have any other relationship to the project. Overall, I'll probably keep this on the shelf for a couple of months but then ultimately donate it to the library to free up some space."
5,"Fun, inviting and a very yummy read!","Right from the beginning you meet some wonderful characters in this writing that 1) you know you've met people just like them 2)you have dreamed of...and 3) you are very interested in learning more about what makes them tick. The story line is very inviting, down to earth, food expiring and YUMMY(in more ways than one). Great Read! Looking forward to more writings like this (combining the love of life with the love of food!). The author Susan Volland has a great talent for making you feel like you are right there in the moment. She has captured feelings I have experienced but have never been able to express."
3,wished there had been more scenes in the kitchen,"I gave it 3 stars because I thought the storyline was good. I liked the main character's interaction with her family. The one area that was a huge problem with me was the dialogue between the main character and her love interest - it felt awkward and was to me the most boring part of the story. I really enjoyed the restaurant scenes as they reminded me so much of the movie,""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""."
4,"A Lively Mix of Food, Family and Exuberance","This is the kind of novel you read for the fun of traveling around inside the head of a wisecracking, funny, moody, self confessing heroine who in the course of two or three paragraphs can be hard as a crab apple, tangy as her Bella's Bloody Mary and soft as a marshmallow. It's also fun to be plunked down in the middle of a vibrant family of restaurateurs by a writer who knows the business."
5,Witty and Interesting,"Giovanna/Jo is a smart and charming Italian woman who works at her family's restaurant. She's in one of those ""searching for herself"" or ""just floating along"" sort of phases. She isn't expecting any changes to her life. While she's not altogether unhappy, she's not moving toward change. Change happens whether she likes it or not. Her family's restaurant is sued for $5,000,000 by a former employee who claimed their candles caused her to have irreparable breathing problems. One of the former waitress's lawyers is a sadistic outcast from high school who is even into stalking 4 year old girls. A fire breaks out at the family's restaurant and Jo is accused of arson. Amidst the chaos, Jo meets a local organic farmer who is selling produce to her family's restaurant and let's just say, she's very interested. I would have expected more kitchen scenes. There is mention of certain dishes and recipes in the back, but not much cooking!"
1,don't do it! don't do it!,"do not be deceived! skip this book unless you want to get totally frustrated. and unless you like boring, borrowed characters who machinate to boring, borrowed plots. (greek wedding, anyone?) the good gal is whiny and stupid. the other good guys are caricatures. the bad guy is a cartoon. and prince charming is, well, good old prince charming, only he rides a red Austin Healy instead of a white horse. [...] disjointed, mottled, and, worst of all, self-unaware, this book is a waste of time. if you're looking for an original romance, a gripping thriller or an examination of the complexities of female desire, look elsewhere. ANY-elsewhere."
5,Definitive,It's not possible to find a better recorded and performed CD of some of the Strauss family's greatest music.The first selection combines the orchestra with the superb Vienna opera chorus. It is a truly great performance of the Blue Danube waltz.Don't be reticent to get a very inexpensive used CD. It will surprise you how good it is.
1,Great Idea Not so Great Book,"I picked up this book hoping for it to be a nice book for my husband I and to use. It had a few nice things but it too much greared to pop-culture for me. When I buy a book I want information I can use to create my own spells and rituals not mainstreamed spells. I do not care for Ms. Horne's books.Instead of this book I'd reccomend ""Wicca for Couples"" by. A.J. Drew."
5,Fiona Horne has a Sex Magick Hit!,"Bright Blessings! I give Fiona Horne ""Five Stars"" on her newly released book ""Magickal Sex: A Witches' Guide to Beds, Knobs, and Broomsticks"". Her book is filled with sexy spells and timely Sex Magick advice for couples and sollitaires alike. Her writing is brief and to the point, very easy to understand and very practial to apply. Her writing style reminds me of Silver Ravenwolf and Deborah Gray. The only thing this book lacks is sexy hot photos of Ms Horne herself!!!Bright Blessings.Raziel-Thadeus"
4,"Everybody loves ""Melody""","In Asia, Europe and Latin America this movie is a blockbuster. In the late 60's and early 70's, Bee Gees had hits over hits all over the world except America until ""Saturday Night Fever"" made them big in the US. The popularity of this ""Melody"" soundtrack in Asia is similar to that of ""Saturday night fever"" soundtrack in 1977. The film starts with the title song ""In the morning""(also knows as ""Morning of my life""), follows by ""To love somebody"", ""First of May"" and ""Melody Fair"". And the rarity is ""Give the best"", which is only available here in this soundtrack album, Crosby, Still, Nash and Young's ""Teach your children"" and Richard Hewson's score as bonus. DVD is available now, but beware, from the US customers' review, the US version (http://www.amazon.com/Melody-Mark-Lester/dp/B001BPJJ1E/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1298012703&sr=1-1) is inferior to the UK version which is available at Amazon.co.uk.(http://www.amazon.co.uk/Melody-DVD-Jack-Wild/dp/B002VD5SA6/)."
5,Nice tool,"This peel is light, large enough for most pizzas, fairy sturdy and folds up for easy storage. All this at an affordable price."
1,Waste of money,"While this looks like a wonderful product that's intelligently designed for ease of use and easy storage, this is a useless piece of junk. DO NOT attempt to use this to slide a pizza into the oven or onto a stone and absolutely do not roll out the pizza dough and top the pizza on this. The dough sticks to the surface and completely ruins the pizza when part of it slides and the rest sticks onto it or folds over. It may work for taking out a pizza, but it's a complete disaster trying to slide pizza into the oven. I've tried it many times, coating it with tons of flour, tons of cornmeal, even olive oil, I stopped short of using WD40. Nothing works on this. I'm buying a wooden peel as soon as I have completely destroyed and bent this abomination out of shape so it can be used no more! A great concept, unfortunately terribly executed. The surface should be wood."
2,Dough always sticks,I tried this peel after my wood peel broke. I like the design and the fact that the handle folds in for easy storage. The problem is that dough sticks like glue to this thing. I had to use 10x as much cornmeal on this than my wood peel. All that extra cornmeal burns and to much stays on the crust. Get a wood peel instead.
4,Looks Nice,This pizza peel is convenient because it folds up. However unless you heavily coat it's surface with corn meal or flour the dough likes to stick to it.
2,FOLDING HANDLE WON'T STAY TIGHT,"I WAS VERY EXCITED TO ORDER THIS AS I EXPECTED GREAT QUALITY FROM SUCH A GREAT CHEF, UNFORTUNATELY WHEN I FIRST TRIED TO UNFOLD THE HANDLE I NOTICED THAT IT DID NOT PROPERLY FIT IN THE NOTCHED WOOD, HENCE MAKING THE SCREW UNABLE TO REMAIN TIGHTENED, DISAPPOINTING AS WITH A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO WHERE THE WHOLE WAS PUT FOR THE SCREW IT WOULD HAVE FIT AND BEEN QUITE USEFUL."
4,"hey, it's pretty good","I like this product b/c the handle is long enough, but it can be ""collapsed"" for easier storage. This is the only pizza peel I have owned, so I don't have a comparison with a wood one....This is what I do: I put a lot of cornmeal on it, roll out the dough (I like a thin crust), put on the red sauce base, and then I slide it off onto the pizza stone that is in the oven (then add the other toppings). I have discovered that that works fine almost every time... if you fully ""dress"" the pizza before trying to slide it on the stone, sometimes it sticks (b/c it's too heavy, I think) - once we just had to have a calzone instead of a pizza ....Overall I am happy the purchase b/c it allows me to roll the dough out for a thin crust, instead of trying to spread/pull it out while on the preheated pizza stone."
5,"Wow, This Baby is The best ever!","This Wok is absolutely the best cooking utensil we have ever had. It cooks very evenly & the surface is just great-cleans up so easily. We use this Wok about 75% of the time, and cook Stews, soups,pasta dishes, stir fries, omelets and is considered first for cooking most of our meals.We just love it and highly recommend it!"
1,No king at all,"Leslie Cheung can hardly be call the king of pop because his singing technique is very weak. In fact, he has little voice. The melodies of the songs here are far too predictable. No good."
4,The second best,"The second best after ""The Compleat Strategyst"" at a primer level, highly redable.Yes, unfortunately enough, I am over the age of 13 (65)"
2,Hit and miss,"The chapter on Zero-Sum game is excellent. However, when it comes to non-zero-sum games, it becomes very confusing. The examples, and the characters in the examples are inconsistent and confusing."
2,Exemples not fully explained,"I haven't yet finished to read the book, but for instance in chapter 3, the author doesn't explain how does he get the final average win for each player. I am frustrated because of this."
4,"A very good introduction,many good examples","My brother and I have both read the book and both of us enjoyed it. I know little about game theory, but I have found it to be one of the most interesting subjects I have read. This book gives many examples that are related to real life experiences which helps to get across the major points. I also enjoyed the many references to experiments. I highly recommend learning about the subject and this book is a good beginning."
4,Good Entry point. Well Written.,"The book is very well written, and surprisingly easy to read, considering how dry the subject matter can be at times. Gives a very nice introduction to the topic, and finishes off with a more formal discussion of some advanced topics.If you are a mathematician, this book is probably excruciatingly easy for you, and probably has little academic value. But, if you are a layman, with an interest in systems and games, it really gives you a lot to think about, and a new way to think about it. It introduces a method of determining possible outcomes, as well as giving a nice overview of more sophisticated concepts, should you decide to explore the topic more fully.Each chapter begins with some questions to consider while reading, and detailed answers to help at the back of each chapter. The only real issue I found with the book is that the questions are missing from chapter one, yet the answers are there. Odd."
1,Embarrassing....But Whatever Rocks Your Boat....,"This music is over.This group is over. Not even 1/3 of the songs listed here were actual *hits*..they are fillars just as they always were. Filling up the spots where hits could not be produced. This is suppose to be a HITS compulation, man. There's like no hits:-? Pure desperation for renewed public interest.SAD!!"
1,well...,three questions.1. did they need to release this?2. did anyone who isnt a female between the ages of 5 and 12 buy this?3. how many of them will keep it once they turn 16?
4,some good old fashioned love songs,"I saw one review that said 98 was closer in style to BoysIIMen then the Backstreetboys, and I couldn't agree more. Not Rock, really, pop, this album almost sounds like R & B. I think die-hard fans were hoping for a whole new CD, but this compilation of their hits is a sure money maker. The success of their love songs reminds me of the quandry Brian Adams faced back in the 80's when he, and I, were in that age group. Adams always said he was a rocker, but all his big hits were sweet love ballads, such as ""Straight from the Heart"" very similiar in style and content to 98 degrees melodies such as ""I Do"". This is why I continue buying and enjoy listening to their music. They may not be the ""Beatles"" of this generation, but they are as good as it gets."
5,GREAT!,My package was shipped before promised time!!! I was very happy! The package is brand new. I recommend to order from this user!
4,98 degrees greatest hits,"I was in my late teens/early 20s when 98 Degrees was popular. They were one of the few ""boy bands"" that I did enjoy during the mid-to-late 90s. Their music was more R&B; oriented than their peers. This CD is a good collection of their hit singles.Tag: greatest hits"
4,Greatest hits from 98 Degrees...mostly good!,"Don't you miss the boy-bands era? There were Hanson, Backstreet Boys, N*Sync, and yes, 98 Degrees. Everybody knows who was in that band: Nick Lachey (check out his ""Soulo"" and upcoming album ""What's Left Of Me"" if you like this album!), Justin, Jeff, and Drew (Dancing With the Stars!) This album has all their hits, from ""Invisible Man"" to ""Why"", and their biggest hit ""The Hardest Thing"". Other great songs are ""Because Of You"", ""My Everything"", ""Was It Something I Didn't Say"", and ""Thank God I Found You (w/ Mariah Carey)"". However, I found their fast songs not half as good as their ballads...""Give Me Just One More Night"" is quite repetitve, and in the middle of the song, there was a part where a girl is speaking Spanish...I find that quite lame. I didn't care for ""True To Your Heart"" neither. However, this album is quite great if you don't own their previous albums."
1,Don't sell used phones to them,I bought phones from this company with no problem. Selling old equipment to them they won't pay! They already sold my used equipment but won't cut me a check. Owner is always busy or unavailable. Would stay away just on that point.
4,Skull crushing southern metal,"The Destro are a four piece band from Gainesville,Tx. They are a mix of southern groove and thrash metal along the lines of Pantera or Exhorder. Let me tell you that this album is great and is a must for anybody who is a fan of the previous bands I just mentioned. What is great about them is the overall intensity of the music that doesn't let up for a minute the whole cd. I love it and I know all of the guys in this band. I just saw them perform here in Austin and my roomate is friends with them so we let them crash at my house. Really nice guys and a really awesome band. Get it now."
4,defective?,"Buyer beware. Great album, but it is defective here.I downloaded the album from iTunes and track 9 and 10 are defective. I tried listening to a sample on amazon.com and [...] and they all have the same defect.Where are these samples coming from that they are all defective?"
1,Cheap piece,"Nothing more to add; does not let the extended life battery to be used; overall impression is ""not impressed"""
4,Great Customer Service!!,"I was originally sent the wrong phone holster, but after emailing them, I received the correct one a few days later with no questions asked. The holster is really nice too!!"
1,Review forTrue game of death,"This movie is terrible. It does not star Bruce Lee and is not directed by Robert Clouse, as advertised by amazon. The only scenes with Bruce are some third rate snipets from Return of the dragon that have nothing to do with The true game of death movie. The best way to describe this movie is that they tried to remake The game of death In which Bruce Lee does actually appear for those few fight scenes that he is in. Acting was terrible! sound, Terrible! Fighting sequences, terrible! Over all this movie was terrible and I do not reccomend that anyone buy this or rent it for that matter."
1,fullscreen madness,"not only is this film poor to watch but the fact it is in 4.3 ratio instead of a 16.9 or wide screen makes the fight scenes look unbareable to watch, you can see this film has a wide screen edition this is obvious when the fight senes are shown you mostly see half there bodies when you should see more.not good viewing.tommy."
2,What a way to commemerate Bruce Lee!,"Don't get me wrong here, the plot is ok! But the cutting and pasting pictures of Bruce is ridiculous. The worst part was a scene where they pasted a photo of Bruce in the mirror. Come on guys you can do better than that!"
3,Completely Yours,"When you take twin brothers who look like Dillon and Wyatt Love, you know you're in for trouble, unless you don't know that there are twins. When her escort from Mr. Complete shows up, Callie Spencer does not have a clue as to what lies ahead of her. Dillon sets her heart racing, but he's almost too much for her. So, realizing that, Dillon gets his identical twin to act as a dampening rod, going on a second date and cooling things down for him. From there, things only get more complicated. Dealing with lovers' spats among the escorts, hiding the truth from Callie, and trying to garner a favorable review for his nightclub, the Love Nest keeps Dillon hopping. When he gets so tangled in half truths that he inevitably trips, will Callie understand and love him still?*** Zany humor builds from the initial gag, charming readers. The supporting cast provides many of the best lines. When you need a fluffy escape, this will fit the bill. ***"
2,Not so complete,"One of the other reviewers hit it on the head. This is a fluffy read. The first 150 pages of this novel were good. Followed the plot of the outside of the book. But it ""jumped the shark"" when the main characters find orphans living in a dumpster. I lost it at that point and went into heavy skim mode.If men in real life talked like the dialogue of these guys, we gals are in trouble. The silly situations were a real stretch. The only masculine thing exhibited was the sex scenes.Too bad the story line missed the plot line. It would have been a better read."
3,Good selection but poor transfers,"I am glad I have this collection. But the pictures are not as good as what is broadcast on TCM. Blurrier and with blooming whites. For instance on Steamboat Bill Jr. which I recorded from TCM, the luggage name tag was easily readable, while not one letter could be made out from this collection. None looked restored, many were poor quality. I was hoping for better quality. Disappointed. Ah well, it was cheap for all these movies."
5,1st in line,This is the first Carol Burnett Show I ever bought and it was so funny I watched it three times.
2,Not the greatest blotting sheets.,"For me, 2 factors go into which blotting sheets I like, (and I've tried 4 different brands). One is how well they work, obviously. The second is how easily they come apart so you don't have to spend significant time trying to separate one sheet from the other. Clinique Pore Minimizer Oil Blotting Sheets are VERY difficult to pull apart from one another. I wasted a number of them as they're so hard to separate. And when you just want to quickly blot your face, you don't want to spend time with that. After using these, I then tried Skin blotting papers by Alison Raffaele - THEY were the BEST! I don't know if you can get them on amazon or not, but find them online asap. ""Skin by Alison Raffaele"" is the best!"
2,The Wilted Flower,"Soon after two of the movie's stars are introduced at an ancient Mayan pyramid, we are taken into rural Mexico for a fiesta highlighted by the ""voladores,"" four dancers who ascend a 30-meter pole, then tied at the waist, dive into the air and play pre-Hispanic musical instruments. Their leader dances at the top of the pole without a rope! Lots of local color in this film.A photographer (blonde Peggie Castle at her most alluring) persuades a reluctant archaeologist (William Lundigan) to take a woman on an expedition searching for the lost Toltec civilization, and seduces a plantation owner (Armando Silvestre), fearful of ""the woman with golden hair"" as in legend, to guide them through the jungle.This is a B-movie which had potential and I had been waiting for a proper DVD release. Image quality is clear enough, but it is an edited version and color hue is on the yellow side."
3,Stunt Rock,"Stunt Rock (1978) features some of the greatest stunt numbers ever filmed particularly during the ""Sorcery"" segment which is performed by Grant Page. That good vs. evil heavy metal sequence alone is reason enough to see this film. And of course the title track during which Sorcery takes their most famous musical sequence is also highly entertaining. And the film does contain plenty of humor especially in the scene where Grant Page describes his early stunt career to the press as being glamorous and artistically stimulating while we see images of his past that contradict this fact by showing scenes of Grant Page himself being pelted by angry punters in a small music hall.Besides, there's a masked keyboardist, stunts painfully gone awry, chicks in gold spandex with guns, wizards, demons, the amazingly awful heavy metal ""Sorcery"", whose live performances, as shown here, are filled with an audience who seem to all be wondering who the hell these people are."
2,Shallow and Uncompelling,"Kind of a drecky book which has a great deal more to do with the English authoress' personal life and issues than any kind of examination of Jordan. She presents herself as an intrepid traveler who falls in love with a Jordanian Bedouin. The book revolves around their relationship and the trails and tribulations of trying to keep it alive. While there are a few interesting tidbits scattered here and there, there are many other books more worthy of your time."
5,A very good account of a near forbidden relationship,"This book illustrates a bitter sweet love story between a western woman and her younger middle eastern lover. The lovers may have married if it weren't for the stubborness of each to keep their native lifestyles,or the ambigous treatment of the author. The entire story is exquistely lace with erotic tension, it is an intellectual racy read."
2,Damaged Package,The product packaging was ripped and damaged. The shipping container was in good shape. So when the gift was opened on Christmas morning what was otherwise a nice gift looked shabby due to the product packaging being ripped and torn.The product itself was not damaged and is about what I expected.
2,Two because of the rigging section,"This book should have been called ""Rigging, oh yeah and modeling"".The modeling section is not very good... It teaches bad topology, doesn't impart the artistic imortance of appeal in characters, and gives students the impression that this is the norm. The animation section is just as cursory and has the potential for being just as misleading. Understand that this book is just the beginning and does not represent the best of the industry.The rigging section... yeah that's not so bad. The major problem there is that it's not a complete industry standard rig by the current norms. Those being wiring parameters for spline-based control rigs to actually manipulate the characters morphs and digits etc. A large control ring and handles would've been good and if there's a section on knee and elbow directional manipulators, I didn't see it.hope this was helpful :/"
3,"Great book, lousy binding.","The information inside the Robot Wars Technical Manual is superb. It's got the background of each house bot as well an imaginary story about each one.BUT and it's a big but, the book is made so poorly that its pages are falling out after only a few days. Every time we open the book the spine splits and a page comes loose. We've had to stick it all back together with tape. We expect better quality for this price."
1,More soulless exploitation,"The original concept of Robot Wars is further and further lost in merchandizing, as the production companies who think they own the concept of robot battle squeeze every bit of profit they can from the competitors. The originals are gone from the scene - since burned out or driven away by lawsuits from the very production companies they built robots for. Not that it matters, there is always a new generation of willing competitors tready to provide an unpaid spectacle for Mentorn's profit."
1,Ugh,"I wish that the fact that the heroine was full-figured made up for the terrible writing. It didn't.This is really one of the most poorly-written books I've ever read. I was so sad about it because I really yearn for a realistic character, and normally I can give an author kudos for the attempt, but I really wish this attempt had never been made. There were grammar and spelling errors, and I felt as if it was written by a junior-high kid. Initially I was going to concede that at least Ballard had a knack for building sexual anticipation, but when she stopped just short of the act with some broad reference to ""and then they had great sex"" I threw up my hands. I'm so disappointed. I am hopeful that perhaps Pat's skill will increase with time and in a few years I can come back to her.Please, if you're looking for a good full-figured romance novel I suggest you look over some of the other books I've reviewed, this one might just turn you against the genre for life."
1,Book not usfull any more,"The College board has changed the test from Pascel, what this book talks about to C++, which is not covered in this book."
3,errored...,"I second the post regarding its errors. This book gets at the core of the information, but there are definately serious in many of the programs that bring it down. Having problems in the program outlines is, in my opinion, absolutely intolerable. The only thing the authors would need to do is RUN the programs on a computer. It is easier to edit than any other AP test book example--reality can check.I don't know how much I trust the book in light of these easily fixable problems. It seems to reflect a geniune lack of diligence and prudence on part of the authors. But, seeing that this book, at least as of now, has monopoly on the market; litte room to reject this book appears."
1,Outlandish,"Outstanding. The book's chapters cover whole language/writing process classrooms, brainstorming, classroom communities, teachable moments, making connections, the power of personal pedagogy, the trauma of parents, the boundaries of caring, annoying students, white trash upbringing, challenging authority, obnoxious students, reading resistant writers within a discourse of resistance, socialized unteachables, and big tall half-men, without once referring to anything about Literature or English. Write on!"
4,US Buyers Beware of Disc Two (DVD),"The cd is a good cd, especially for Anouk fans. I am a fan! But the second disc is a DVD and does not play on U.S. players, so it is of no value to US buyers. You are paying [money] for only the first disc."
2,Total Downer,"This isn't a fun collection of songs. Most of them are ballads, and while they are well done, they don't really interest my kids."
5,New scent.,"My first with this scent, I was pleased with the packing being factory sealed, I really enjoy the new sent. And it arrived early. Thanks"
5,A inspirational biography,"I loved the book and felt Jeff Cook did a wonderful job in details,emotions, and the true meaning of women triathletes. As a triathlete myself I have read this book many times and always feel like I could read it again. Very inspirational."
1,A better actor than singer,"I don't think Leslie Cheung is a good singer at all. He may be a good actor but his singing is very ordinary. In fact, he needs the music to cover the difficulties in his singing. He's just an idol who doesn't have much a voice. If you're his fans, you'll perhaps like the CD. Otherwise, it's definitely not a good buy."
3,Beautiful but not Useful,"For a new quilter, this book of 501 patterns is wonderful to read and look at the finished work but I find the instructions difficult to non-existent. I wouldn't give up the book for the world and, if you can purchase a used copy for $3.00, I would go for it but don't expect to be using their quilting patterns. The finished quilts are lovely to look at and might give you ideas but then you'll need to purchase a book with actual quilting patterns. The quilt squares are only 4"" which also makes them difficult for the beginner. If you are an advanced quilter, you might more out of this book than I did."
3,501 Quilt Blocks,"I just received this book and while the photos and projects are wonderful, I wasn't expecting the blocks to be 4"" squares. However, I don't believe it will be difficult to adjust the size and there is certainly plently of inspiration available. I can't wait to get started on some projects."
3,More Ideas Than Instructions,"I dug this book out of a pile of crafting books recently as I thought that I should finally begin my plan to make a proper quilt. I've made one or two pillows and a small lap quilt, but that's about the extent of my work.I definitely found inspiration looking at page after page of beautiful quilt blocks in '501 Quilt Blocks', but not much more. While there is a brief instructional section at the back, it is not nearly as clear or detailed as it should be for a beginning quilter, this is definitely one for someone far more advanced than I am.The projects at the beginning of the book are beautiful and definitely something to aim for once I am a bit more skilled. A better description of how to make the blocks shown in the book would be helpful and is certainly what I would change even for more experienced crafters."
5,A gift for my mother in law,"You know, she doesn't speak a word of english, but the pictures in this book are so nice, and it has so many samples of nice work, that she was able to reproduce some of them by herself, even without being able to read the instructions. Surely it was a good choice."
3,Great block ideas!,"As a beginning quilter I love seeing all the different blocks with the names. It's a great reference guide. However, I don't like the fact that the blocks are so small and the patterns don't give you cutting instuctions or seam allowances. The color photos of the finished blocks are really nice to have, but the sewing in the photos is not very good quality and it gives the impression that the blocks may be difficult to make."
3,Great block ideas--not really for beginners...,"This is a great block pattern book. However as a beginner quilter, I have a hard time using this book to it's full potential because many of the patterns are a difficult and translating these blocks into a quilt requires some experience in figuring out how much fabric you'll need. I am definitely keeping the book and I'm sure I'll use it more when I'm a bit more experienced. I would recommend it to intermediate and advanced quilters."
5,BH&Gardens 501 quilt blocks,"The book just arrived. I am new at quilting. There is every applique design you could ever want to use. The other block designs are just beautiful. If I could only have 1 book to use, it would be this book. The directions are clear and very easy to understand. I can't wait to get startedf!!!"
3,"Good variety, great applique! Good for miniaturists.","I found this book to be a reference I turn to again and again, especially when I'm looking for floral applique ideas and holiday inspirations. Also, the small size of the blocks included (all blocks are 4"" square) allows for a lot of experimentation. I only gave it three stars because there are so many ""families"" of blocks; that wasn't initially clear when I purchased it -- I hoped for more variety. Fun to leaf through when I'm feeling a little blocked (pun not intentional -- sorry!), however."
5,The most useful quilting book for the busy quilter!,"This book offers wonderful quilt block patterns for great quilts and projects including baby quilts, cat quilts, holiday projects, Noah's Ark, Sewing Motifs, and much more. In addition, it includes many patterns for traditional quilt blocks and some lovely applique patterns. My absolute favorite quilting book"
1,demora,Ainda estou aguardando o recebimento dos produtos. A previso de entrega era para 06/03/2012!Gostaria de saber o motivo da demora pois já tem um atraso de 40 dias para a entrega.
4,Quilt Blocks,Book OK and in as-described condition. Please with seller's shipping time. I rate this seller as a good one.
4,comfortable DVD,"This is a different type of tour-guide DVD from Rick Steves' or Rudy Maxa's.It is not flavored with these well-known personalities,but well organized and comfortable."
3,buy direct save lots of money,if you buy direct from the author you can get this for $40 at body recomposition. seeing it here for 2-3x that is very irritating and I have not even read the book yet.
1,Grossly overpriced!,"When one pays nearly $50 for a book, one expects to get more than an 80 page, flimsy spiral bound notebook that looks like it was self published from someplace like Staples. For that much money, you'd think the author would at least edit his work, correct the massive amount of typos, and grammerical errors and try to structure in such a way that it reads like something an adult would write instead of a 4th grader. Furthermore, don't bother to buy this book if you've read any of his other books, cause this book is merely a cut and paste version of stuff he's already published in his Rapid Fat Loss Book etc. In a nutshell: Basically all he says in this book is what we already know about dieting. Eat less calories, and be more flexible so we can do this for the long term. Well, I paid $50 for this, so buyer beware. You don't get much for your buck here, nor do you even get a clean edited copy. It's just a rough draft like read, with 80 pages of tiresome rambling."
2,Could have been so good,"This book was required for a Women's Study class of mine. The idea and concept of the book was great; however, the writing is poor providing an awkward read. Far too many quotes from additional authors and then a small summary from the author. It could have been really good, I would NOT recommend this book."
1,This is an Alfred Hitchcock film?,"This film was part of an Alfred Hitchcock 20 Movie DVD set I had purchased. For the most part, I have enjoyed these movies. When I got to this one though, and started playing it, my first thought was ""Alfred Hitchcock directed this?"". I was expecting something that had suspense, like The Lodger (currently one of my favorite B&W films). What I got was a film that had the hardest storyline for me to follow. Throughout the whole film I had no idea what was happening. The acting was terrible. The audio and video quality was bad compared to his other films. The characters are so dull that I had no feelings for them at all. This movie is also VERY boring, most of the movie takes place in a room where almost nothing happens. As a 17 year old movie buff, I feel let down by the Master of Suspense with this film. Avoid at all costs."
5,Just what I wanted!,It was a very fast delivery! it was all perfectly wrapped and my husband loved it! The price was also very good! cheaper than other stores=)ThanksRD
3,review it,this tester is not good and doesnt smell as pure as it should..in my view it wasting 33bugs for it...
3,Should this C.D. be burned?,When i first heard this c.d. I didn't like it. eventually I started to take the time to really hear the beats and lyrics. This is a good c.d. and I recommend it to anyone.
3,Alright Album,"This album suffered from two things, The beats and The fact that it didnt feel like an album but just a sampler of things to come from Fiend and his camp. The album wasnt complete, it just felt like a bunch of tracks thrown together. Fiends previous 3 records were very well put together and felt like an album from start to finish. There are some nice jams on this cd but even on them Fiend doesnt seem like himself. I listen to some of the songs still but i always skip alot. I would still cop this cd though because its not too expensive and there are actually some good tracks."
3,FIEND IS OFF THE TANK,"Fiend is no longer with Master P or No Limit Records, but the question is whether he has enough firepower to go solo. The answer is yes. The production is just as good (just as bad) as Beats by the Pound (The Medicine Men). This time Fiend features newcomers that don't sport No Limit Tank medallions. While the production suffers more without Beats by the Pound, the No Limit goons aren't missed. Fiend also enlists the help of Twista and another No Limit escapee- Big Ed (who takes a few punches at the old colonel, Master P). Overall the album won't disappoint any try Fiend fan. I kind of like this album more than Mystikal's album. The only reason I give it 3 stars is the lack of better beats and the awful album cover"
3,It's okay but you probably want Talking Buzz,"I ordered this for both of my sons for Christmas...they're huge Toy Story fans. This was labeled as the ""ultimate"" Buzz, so I thought this would be the closest to replicating the Buzz from the movie. Both of the helmets were scratched when it showed at our home from the poor packaging and the wings are near impossible for the kids to retract themselves -- really, they feel like they will break every time I fix them. There's screw holes all over the back of it, and it only says 5 phrases, as opposed to the 30 of the Talking Buzz. The front wing button doesn't do anything at all, and the wing button is on the back which really disappointed my ""stickler for detail"" three year old. Overall it was okay -- but for $10 more I could have gotten much more -- this is definitely NOT ultimate in any sense of the word. But if you have a kid who won't care all that much and want to treat Buzz as Andy does in the movie like his new best friend, it's probably fine."
5,lots of fun for my toy story character lover,"My 4 year old grandson loved Buzz so much, that I decided to have one at my house for him too. Needless to say, Buzz 2 joined Buzz 1 at home so they could have rescue missions together. :-)"
4,"Good toy, but I got it for $19 at Target, not $189 here","I bought my 3 y.o. the exact same 12 inch doll, but for a fraction of the price. I also got it for me... Personally Woody with drawstring is a bit softer and less bulky, but who can go past the audio of Buzz? So we got both. Note: the lazer is an LED (safer), the compass is a bizaar addition, the backpack has wings inside? I hadn't noticed. Will see if I can find it (it fell off already after a week). Legs strong and posable.check is this vendor is a fake before paying the price... like I say, 20 bucks October 2008. Surely I am not so lucky as get something with a one missing in front of the price?!"
3,sorry buzz... we like the soft version better,"My boys love the Toy Story 2 gang and we already had a soft plush version of Buzz Light year. This one looked cool - almost like the real thing - and had the bells and whistles. However, he is heavy and awkward. He does not sit, his lower body spins out of control, and his wings jet out constantly even when you don't press the button. I find my boys playing with the soft buzz more often."
1,I was extremely disappointed!,"This product was a ""downer"". It didn't look like I wanted it to, and the helmet was scratched. My husband wanted me to send it back, but I had a hard time doing so. Disney wanted me to pay to return the product. I paid to have it shipped initially. I called the loca Disney store and they took it back, but the taxes I got back was lower than what I paid, and I still got no reimbursement on my shipping. I won't order from [...] anymore. This is not what I expect from one of the most famous customer service companies in the industry."
2,buzz light year,"I an too old to play with buzz light year-was gift for 5 year old grandchild. In my humble opinion it cost to much for what is made of, can't figure out why it has any educational value."
5,Connect to the movie,"Fun action figure, great for kids who love the movie. I was hoping for Tim Allen's voice, but kids don't seem to notice the difference."
3,Buzz Lightyear 2006,"We bought the Toy Story and Beyond Buzz in October 2006 at the Disney Store for our 4-year-old. I concur with ""Average Joe's"" review, except for one thing: ours has wings. They don't rotate into place like on the movie, but extend out horizontally. They seem a little flimsy but have held up so far. Other than that, the toy is very true to the movie character except there is no ""mission log"" door on his forearm, and the laser sound effect is a little different. The big red button on his chest does not deploy his wings (as in the movie), there is a small button on the back for that. Most frustrating aspect of this toy is that his joints are so floppy that he can't stand on his own. My son loves the toy overall."
3,Buzz Lightyear,"I bought this for my 2-1/2 yr old son for Christmas. He enjoys playing with it, but I wish it had been packaged better. The packaging wasn't the greatest, so the helmet got damaged during shipping. (Not enough to warrant the hassle of returning it; it got scratched up a little.)"
3,"Looks great, quality is so-so","This Buzz is okay from an adult point of view. For a kid he's great to look at, hard to play with. We were disappointed that it doesn't sound like Tim Allen's voice even though it's a Disney toy. The hips swivel a lot so he's kind of hard to hold and the helmet pretty much just stays open now. Our biggest complaint is the wings - they are very very hard to put back in (you have to open them both first & put them back in at the same time). Not sure we'd buy him again but the reaction when our little one first opened him earns this toy 3 stars."
3,Buzz Lightyear,My little girl loves Toy Story! We got her this toy for Christmas. She loves it and often wants to sleep with it. My biggest issues with it is that it is bulky and cumbersome. Also the wings come off all the time.
3,Not That Great,"I bought this toy a few years ago for my son and it was nice but it has a few sayings, the wings are like 5 1/2 inches long, the laser lights up and makes sounds and the blue and black belt does NOT do anything. My opinion is you do not buy it at that price of 40.00."
1,This is a USED toy for retail prices!,"I wish I would have read the reviews. It has problems. It is used and repackaged. It doesn't work all that well, but my daughter loves it. I don't have anything against used toys, but I have something against a $40 used toy that I would have paid $4.00 for at a yard sale. It is scratched, loose, doesn't move properly, everything everyone else said. I live overseas on a military base. So returning and re-ordering (not from this guy) would have taken at least a month. She was not letting go of him as soon as she saw him so there you go. I went back and forth w/ Amazon who finally gave me $10 of the $40 back as a refund. So, I think that is the end of it. Still...$30 for a used toy is almost as bad. Amazon has always done right by us, dunno why they are still letting this vendor sell."
5,Tim Allen Voice Buzz!,"For my 4 year old, and it is a wonderful addition to the TOy Story Collection! This is the Tim Allen voice."
1,Lowest quality toy,"This toy is a piece of crap. My son had it for less than 24 hours and the arm fell off. Of course, it's the arm with the laser! As other reviewers have mentioned, the pop-up wings are sketchy at best. Also, when I tried to slide back Buzz's retractable helmet, one side of it popped out. Unfortunately, we cannot return this broken, poor quality product to the store because my son's grandparents bought it for him, and they threw away the box. I guess they are from a generation when toys lasted. KrazyGlue isn't working, so I suppose it's on to the trusty duct tape."
4,Great fun but tippy,"Overall this is a great toy. It's really Tim Allen saying things like ""This is an intergalactic emergency"" and 4 other sayings (I think). The laser button is fun, too.Quibbles:-It is almost impossible to get him to stand up - he tips over very easily- The wings are hard to fold up. You have to push in and down and hear them click. Much too hard for a little kid!"
3,Sensei of Japanese Sticks,"If you're into technical trading, this is the sensei of Japanese candle stick trading, a practice that dates back hundreds of years ago among rice traders. If you're not into technical trading, this is a heavy read that's bound to bore you a little.It's a handy reference. Every kind of Japanese candle stick pattern you ever wanted to know. Difficult to master."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"I have rarely been as disappointed in a book as I was by this one. The book abounds with errors of fact, misspellings and boring retelling of stories well known to any baseball fan. The only thing perfect about this book is that it's perfectly dreadful."
2,Not worth the annoyances,"I've had this item since March 2007. The only reason I got it was to serve as speakers for an mp3 player and there were very few systems that had inputs for anything besides an Ipod. I wasn't all that interested in most of the features though the ability to completely shut off the back light was good as well as having a remote. The first thing that annoyed me was that everytime the unit is turned on or off the lights come on and its necessary to press the button multiple times to shut them back off. Next, it doesn't keep time. Then after a few months the speakers would stop output until I powered off the machine and let it set awhile, eventually it became necessary to shut it off after every use. Finally it started spontaneously cutting out to the radio even though it was in AUX. It also has a huge power brick that gets very hot leading one to suspect it uses a lot of energy even when not actually being used.Bottom line, not worth the annoyances."
5,great deal,It's everything depicted and the sound is great-- a fantastic deal and easy to get set up. I recommend it highly.
1,iHate,"I just received this as a Christmas present. And it was even on my Christmas Wish List. It was something that sounded great on paper, but not in practice.First of all, you can't attach headphones to this device. This is a very basic feature that I am finding it hard to find anymore on clock radios. It has a Line Out, but that is only for powered speakers. Because apparently someone might want to hook up their clock radio alarm clock to their stereo system???Also, the display is very late 80's. It is a basic LCD display and the lowest light on the display still lights up the bedroom. So I have to turn off the back light and therefore can't see the time during the night!AND, I used it to listen to podcasts on my 80gb iPod. It connected just fine and I could listen to the podcasts just fine, however, when I connected the iPod back to my Mac it told me the iPod was corrupted and I needed to restore the whole iPod!Needless to say, it is going back as soon as possible."
1,This product will not charge new ipod nano,This product will not charge an ipod nano that was purchased this Christmas. The manufacturer's website is not accessible and their toll free number for customer service tells you to go to their website for help. This must be an old product that is not compatible to the new ipod's even though the product description says it is. Be aware of this if you are considering purchasing this product.
2,Ipod Speaker,"This speaker has a very good quality of sound, but mine is not working well anymore within 4 months ... and my another friend also has the same problem, so ..."
1,A clock that can't keep time,Every month or two I have to manually re-set the time as the clock gains a minute every few weeks.It doesn't really matter how or whether the rest of the functions work if you can't even use it as a clock!
4,Good price for a good ipod alarm clock,The reason I settle on this model were the price and the fact that the backlight can be turned off. I am a light sleeper and the iHome would wake me up. The audio quality is pretty good but not fantastic. Radio reception has a little more static to it than any of my home stereos. The quickness of the alarm to get to the highest level is really startling in the morning but not a deal breaker. The remote with mine only has a range of 3 feet. All in all it was a good purchase for the price. All ipod alarms clocks have quirks or features missing so you basically have to decide which feature mean the most to you. This one is the one for me.
3,good for bedroom music but don't bet on ipod dock,"I got it a couple of weeks ago and I was really happy with its music performance and the full feature set- it comes even with a handy remote if you prefer to put it opposite to your bed.However, suddenly I couldn't listen to ipod's nano music when docked. I had already heard about dock problems but I thought I'd be lucky- not. The iLuv I got was manufactured March/2006 and the compalints reports I'd read dated earlier- I thought everything would be OK by now. I tell you, don't expect the dock to function more than a couple of weeks...The funny thing is my nano still charges and obeys to iLuv's controls- only that music can't be heard. All other features (radio, alarms) function normally- for the time being..."
3,Good Sound -Poor Design,"Overall, I like the product, good sound...with a few exceptions:1)Be aware that the buzzer alarm is HORRIBLE...the pitch and sound pierces your central nervous system and it does NOT start low and increase as indicated in the manual.2) There is no way to preset/store radio stations.3) The time set/tuner and volume ""buton"" is an AWFUL design that is really hard to use/control. Design was NOT very well thought out.This items is REALLY good if you only plan to use the IPod with it, that is its focus...everything else was an afterthought."
4,Almost Perfect,"I've searched long and hard for a good priced iPod dock clock radio. I've tried all the models at target, sears, BB, CC....etc. I've tried the iHome IH5 at my stay in the Mandalay bay hotel in vegas, and the sound is comparable to the iLuv177. The iLuv may sound a bit better in fact. The best sounding iPod clock radio I found was the Philips A300 but it lacked an AM radio which is a necessity for me to listen to news radio.Only problem I have is that the dials on top of the iLuv are extremely hard to turn as there is no grip and it's quite stiff. I sent iLuv (jwin) and email and they promptly responded with an Return authorization. It wasn't a big deal for me since I can control what I needed from the included remote. I did not return the item. iLuv did not skimp on the accessories (all ipod adapters, antenna, a/v plugs, hefty power adapter)or customer service. I would have rated a 5 if it wasn't for the dials being so difficult to turn."
4,Not bad!,"This product works exactly like it says its going to- it wakes you up when you want, features a snooze button and has a remote and adjustable dimmer. The sound is pretty good as well!The only downside to this product if you're a little OCD or have a variable schedule (like me on both accounts), is that its hard to check what time you've set the alarm to without accidentally turning off the alarm. Also, the backlight is quite bright (even on the lowest setting), but can be easily turned off.If there was a way to check the alarm easily and the dimmer had a super low setting, I'd give this a 100% satisfaction rate. However, due to that.. I say 90% satisfied."
3,birthday gift,"This was a birthday gift to my 14 yr. old son. He was getting an Ipod touch and needed something to charge it with. So far it has been working great. Only one speaker works when using the ipod, but both work on using the radio. It does not have preset stations available.All in all though it works for him, and that's all that counts"
3,"Works great, but I wonder if it drained our iPod battery??","Since we purchased this and put our iPod on it, our iPod battery has not worked as long. It may be a coincidence, but I can no longer take the iPod with me on runs for over 10 minutes, sad. It may be something to investigate further. The speakers sound great. I like the display. It works well."
3,iLuv Review,"Beware that the alarm feature for this radio does not work with the Apple I-touch! Otherwise, it is a good alarm clock."
2,Not so great at keeping the time,"I had this item for 2 years before it became completely unreliable. It would spontaneously turn off (often with a loud annoying noise) while I had it on the radio or ipod function, and sometimes it would turn off in the middle of the night and wouldn't turn back on so the alarm wouldn't go off. Not such a great product if you're counting on it to get up on time. I think there's probably better alarm clocks out there for iPods, and I moved on to the ""iHome"" now. I'm sad that this piece of electronic equipment didn't last more than 2 years. I had an radio alarm clock in high school that is still going strong 10 years later. The iLuv was also not so great at keeping time. It ran a bit fast, so that if I didn't reset it every couple of days, it was 10 minutes faster than my watch. I did like that it included the chords to plug it into my TV, I watched my movies from my iPod that way a couple of times."
2,Display & Tuning,"Pros - solidly built, speakers sound good, has adapters for every size iPod, large numbers on clock display with date and time in 12 or 24 hr format, easy to see in the daytime. It's a good size docking station, so be sure to make note of the dimensions. Cons - difficult to set. With the iPod type spin dials on the top it was difficult to find the right touch to turn them & it wasn't consistent. The display has four settings, off, dim for which there is very little contrast so it's hard to see if you're 45+. Medium & bright were like headlights shining in the room at night. If you weren't using it in a bedroom I'd give it 3-4 stars."
3,Warning No Headphone Jack,"In the product description it says ""3.5mm stereo headphone jack."" That is not true. There is an output jack but no headphone jack. If you plug your headphones in you will hear music from them but the music will also be coming out the speakers as well."
1,Could not set the clock.,It is hard to review fully this product because I bought it to serve as an alarm clock and I never could set the clock. I returned the defective item for credit.
1,I never rate products but....,"This is my first time rating a product I've purchased on Amazon, and also the first product that just didn't work. This was one of the higher-rated iPod docking stations available, so I invested the $70 and got it for Mom for Christmas. The only thing that worked was the radio, and that stopped abruptly after a week. I figure a working radio was worth one star.If I had to do it over, I'd buy from a physical store so I could return it more easily."
3,Works but my Ipod died after using it for 2 days,Works pretty well...but after the 2nd or 3rd day I was using it the hard drive on my Ipod died. The Ipod was extremely hot and the drive was clicking and would not spin. I am going to replace the hard drive but I don't know if I will put it back on the I luv.
4,Love this item,Purchased this for my daughter for her iPod and the sound is amazing. It's easy to use and she loves it.
2,Disappointment.,"The sound was inferior--tinny to a degree that was downright irritating. It seemed cheaply built with flimsy materials, and it's silly not to include an adapter cable for using other brands of MP3 players. These cables are very inexpensive and would eliminate the need for another, separate order; I didn't notice that it wasn't included. Fortunately, my son had extra cable and the iLuv worked fine with my Creative Zen Nano. The sound was just too lousy, though, and I returned the product. Amazon refunded my purchase immediately. In my experience, their customer service is terrific."
2,Alarm volume control issues,"I purchased this mainly as an alarm but was happy with the multiple features it offered. I was disappointed that the volume of the morning alarm could not be set below ""10"" which was, IMHO very loud. There was a sticker added to the manual explaning that the alarm volume could not be set below '10', but if you were just listening to the radio like during the day, you could easily adjust the volume down below ten or up. Since there was this 'sticker' added after the fact in the usage guide, I have to believe it was a manufacturing 'oversight' during product design."
4,iPod Speaker System works for me,"The system is just what I was looking for. A reliable alarm clock that can plug into my iPod. The x-tra accessories can be a bit overwhelming, but don't be scared off. They sound it great. The volume on the radio alarm is a bit loud for my tastes. But, other than that I am glad I made this purchase.iLuv Electronics I177BLK iPod Speaker System (Black)"
1,FATAL FLAW,"As others have noted, the minimum volume setting for the radio wake mode is too high - WAY too high for me. It's a deal killer. It's interesting to note that the instructions were edited with a piece of tape to indicate wake volume of ""10 to 40"" instead of ""1 to 40"" as originally printed.The two disks that are used for tuning, volume, and time setting are difficult to use and are just a bad idea.None of the supplied adapters worked with our nanos."
3,"Acceptable, but not great","The systems performs reasonably well as a dual alarm clock with radio and iPod input. I selected this product over the very similar iHome because it sounds a bit better. However, there are some annoying quirks with the user interface:- The box could have more prominent buttons for switching the radio on and off. As is, these are undistinguished buttons among many (or even too many).- No radio station presets.- The remote is a poor substitute for the clickwheel, because it lacks ""Menu"" and ""Center"".- The control ""wheels"" for volume and tuning/clock are tough to operate in low humidity. A slight finger mold would help.- While it's nice to have backward/forward control to set the alarm, the time increment is not adaptive, so you have to spin the wheel for a while to skip over larger time periods."
4,Great for the price,"Very reasonably priced unit. It sounds really good and has some nice features...but a couple things that are lame - the button to forward the time etc is the dumbest design! Who wants to have to twirl a button continually? The only other thing is the light on the unit...while it can be turned off completely is VERY bright when on. It lights up the whole room! Would be great to make a less bright light. Overall though, for the money its a pretty good buy."
4,SO Far SO Good...,"I've only had this one day but, so far so good. It definately seems worth the money. Additionally, a friend of mine own's an i-home clock radio (which is similar) and I like this one better. It has two alarms (so you can set a buzzer or radio backup if you forget your ipod or just have two different times a day your alarm goes off!) which is a very nice feature. The remote doesn't seem to work fine enough. Also, it's nicer lookign than the i-home.My only complaint, so far, is that the nano adaptor does not fit my nano. I do nto know if this is because I have a ""new"" nano, but it should fit or they shoudl offer one that does."
3,Good but flawed.,"The minimum alarm volume setting is TOO LOUD. Also, as noted by the reviewer below, the ""click wheels"" you use to adjust settings are a bit flakey. Similar to the iHome, they are completely smooth, so it's hard to get a grip on them to actually turn them, particularly when the alarm is blasting and you're trying to turn it down!It's a shame because the sound quality is excellent, and the remote works very well."
3,"Tinny sound, okay design. A little big for the bedside.",I wish the sound were as good as my JBL portable speakers but it just isn't. You definitely get what you pay for when it comes to speakers. The alarm controls are reasonably well-designed. The iPod and Mini dock well but it can sometimes take some doing to get an iPod Shuffle going through its specialised input. Overall the size of the thing is just that little bit too clunky for the bedside given that all that size does not deliver great fidelity in sound reproduction. It's a good entry-level design for using your iPod in bed or as an alarm. I use mine to fall asleep to with an audio book and this does work well for that.
2,It doesn't keep the time,"I have had this item for 9 months, I am going to buy another one because it doesn't keep time!I have to adjust the time every month because it gains 10 to 15 minutesSound is good enough, but size is a little too big for meManuel"
4,Love the sound! Worth the price!,I bought this product to use at work with my iPod. I work in an open setting and can't really use headphones. This i177 is perfect! Great sound quality for turning up the volume and great sound quality for keeping at low levels so I don't disturb colleagues while they work. I dock my iPod in it all day and listen to music!
2,Docking Ipod,"Got this thing for the wife at Christmas and it's already out of comission. The docking connector that the ipod connects to is directly attached to the circuit board so you need to be super careful in attaching and removing your ipod. The whole connector came free from the unit while removing the ipod, effectively making it a clock/radio. I'm going to call and see how they want to handle the repair. If they start messing around I'll let you know.Mike"
2,iHome,iHome was a little larger than what I wanted. Didn't really play it once I saw the size. I returned the product.
4,great sound great price,i bought this product for my daughter. all's she does is thank me for it.she said it sounds great and is easy to use plus it charges her ipod while she's listening.
4,Does the job,"I bought this iluv for the baby's room. It works great, good sound and easy to operate. The only thing is that the remote does not work that great from an angle."
3,Just stopped working,"We bought the iLuv for our daughter when she was 12 because it supposedly would dock a Shuffle. That never did work right. But, as an alarm clock it worked great for about a year. But, just a couple days ago, our daughter was late getting ready for school because her iLuv alarm didn't go off. Sure enough, the display was totally blank and none of the functions worked. I have no idea what happened to it. There is a light plugged in to the same outlet, and it still turns on, so the breaker didn't flip. I've tried plugging it in to other outlets in the house, but there's nothing from the iLuv. No reset button to press...I guess this is the age of disposable electronics. What a waste. We bought her an iHome and now she's back in business."
2,Doesn't work!,I purchased 2 of these for our daughters. One works okay and the other one doesn't!! It only worked for a few days. I have yet to see how the customer service of this company will work.
1,save yourself money,"Do not purchase... This item has blown up one of our Ipods!!! I bought 2 units one for my son and one for my daughter, my daughter's unit the Ipod dock never worked!!! My son's almost blew up the morning!! go for Ihome... save your money!!"
1,Terrible...Just Terrible,"The title says it all. The one and only redeeming factor of this unit is the sound quality. But as an alarm clock it's one of the worst I've ever tried to use. For the same price I suggest the Memorex Mi4290BLK, check out my comparison review of these two units here on amazon at the other alarm clocks site."
5,Great Product...Worth every penny in your pocket.,"I had bought this product for my significant other. When my girlfriend got to open it and also try it out for the 1st time. It worked great, the sound is good and the cool part about it is that. You can dim the light to see what time it is or use a song in your iPod as a wake up song alarm. My Girlfriend loved it and so did I. I feel that it was worth every dollar and penny I had to be able to purchase this product. I would totally re-commend this iPod Deck to anyone. I hope you enjoy it as much as my Girlfriend did. =D"
1,Won't charge new Nano,"Although this manufacturer claims that the iLuv i177 is compatible with the new iPod Nano, their version of 'compatibility' apparently does not include device charging. On page 13 of the user's manual there is an entry ""Please note that this unit cannot charge iPod without 30-pin connector"". The new iPod Nano has a 32 pin connector. I'm not sure this is the reason, but neither of our new Nanos will charge on the i177.It is being returned."
4,Good product.,"I've had this for a few weeks now. The dual alarm feature is pretty good and one of the main reasons I bought it. It also has a good sleep timer that can be set on different times. The sound is clear and does the job. This is not for someone that is looking for a full feature high end stereo. This is for someone that wants a good alarm radio that can play their ipod. The downfall is the remote, if the reason you are buying it is the remote, I would suggest try to find something else. I have a 160gb iPod classic and it fits perfectly, it also has different docks for other ipod sizes. It looks really nice and the screen can be set at 3 different light settings or off. Overall I think it is a good product."
3,"Good product, but lately I've had problems","I bought the iLuv almost a year ago, and it's worked fine, until recently. When I dock my iPod, it usually doesn't work until I try undocking and docking it another couple of times. Other than that, though, I like the sound, and the alarm is good. If you're planning on taking it from place to place, though, be advised that the date and time reset every time you unplug it for over an hour. Overall, it's worth it."
1,Doesn't keep time,"Everything works great on my iLuv, except for the most basic of things - it doesn't keep time! I have to reset the time every so often because it loses minutes. For example, it was last reset about two months ago for daylight savings and now the time is currently behind by about 10 minutes."
2,Alarm volume is too loud and not adjustable to be lower,"In theory this is a cool device with a neat feature set and sound, however there is a terrible oversight in the alarm-it is way too loud and cannot be adjusted to be lower!If you like waking up to soft music or talk radio, this device is absolutely not for you. The softest volume setting allowed is way too loud.I was also not at all impressed with the AM/FM reception.On the plus side, when connected to my iPod, the unit seems to work and sound pretty well and the remote control is handy. But I can't use this for the intended purpose, as a clock radio to wake me up in the mornings."
2,Was happy...........for awhile,"I agree with all the pros - included remote, two alarms, adjustable ""gentle-wake"" volume, etc. One of the things I looked forward to the most was the dimmer, and the fact that you could turn it completely off or put it on max brightness. Unfortunately, after appx. 3 months, the max brightness began ""flickering"", and now, max brightness is nothing more than a faint light (and yes, still flickering). ALL the dimmer brightness levels have dropped appx. 80% and seem to continuously get worse. I almost can't read the time at night anymore - max level or not."
1,Doesn't work with 2nd Generation Shuffles,"The product description says ""Accepts all ipods including shuffle."" But the shuffle we have didn't work. I contacted iLuv and they confirmed that ""If your IPod shuffle is the second generation unfortunately it will not work with the docking station"". This is false/misleading advertising."
1,Failed after 6 weeks!,My dock has distorted sound when playing ipod through it after only 6 weeks. No it isn't the ipod which is fine. Haven't managed to work out how to get a replacement or refund yet! Pretty disgruntled.Liked the unit until it stopped working properly......
2,Defective merchandise with no support,"So this is exactly what i was looking for. Radio, buzzer alarm, ipod playback, but the problem was with the ipod playback. My devce must have been defective, becase niether a 5th gen ipod video, nor a 4th gen ipod nano would playback through the speakers. When the ipods were connected I could use the buttons on the device and the remote to tell the ipods to play and stop. I could also advance and reverse the play list, but there was no sound, nor would either device charge."
5,Nice Design,"Got this for my daughter because she needed a new clock/docking station/etc. and I liked the design and hoped that it would function well as others had said. It's been easy for her to use, and we've had no problems. Remote works well, easy to use, plus she loves the fact that the light from the clock at night is pretty bright. Although there are settings to dim the light, it's still very bright on the lowest setting (as others have noted). Our daughter loves it, because it acts as a nightlight."
4,Good sound from iPod and radio.,This i177 has dual alarms and a radio as well as being able to play music from an iPod. The remote control is very small but does it's job. The i177 will charge most iPods but will not (like a lot of devices) charge the iPod touch 2G.The big snooze bar makes it easy to snooze for a few more minutes after the alarm goes off.The round knobs are sometimes difficult to spin since they are flat and smooth. It would be nice if they were textured or if the knobs were replaced by push button digital controls.One big downside is that when you wake with radio from an alarm the volume is very loud. It has a preset level that can't be changed.
4,I love my iLuv,"I am very happy with this purchase. I chose this model after reviewing other models and a popular complaint of the other systems was the brightness of the time display. This model has three brightness settings and an OFF setting for the display so is perfect for those who like total darkenss! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the size. This is much bigger than any traditional alarm clock I have ever owned and takes up a considerable amount of space on my night stand. With my lamp, phone and this unit, there is no room for any extra's! It does have a remote so, if you have the right room setup, you could position it elsewhere."
3,Not bad for the price-remote weak,"This little radio kicks- especially when you consider the price. Good sound and works fine- but the remote is not good for much of a range-unless the battery they sent in mine is getting low. Good looking unit too-I get compliments on it! We put it out on our deck - didn't want an expensive on out there. Again, no Bose, but good for the price."
5,Use the dock adapters,"This is a great product , but you have to listen to the instruction manual. You have to use the dock adapters at all times, otherwise the little docking chip or whatever its called will break off."
2,"""Wake To"" Button suddenly died.","Amazon replaced it with a second unit after the first one had issues with the ""Wake To"" button. I could not choose between iPod, Radio or Buzzer to wake up to. The second unit arrived and it worked fine for a few days and then the ""Wake To"" button stopped working again. Too bad, because the rest of the functions are OK and its sound is very nice. I ordered a full refund. What I can't complain about is Amazon's service, they are the best, they deserve 10 stars!"
1,4 years then it died.,"I purchased this product in Febuary of 2008. I used an ipod that would no longer hold a charge without being placed in the docking position, everything was fine for 4 years. Then the unit just stopped working, no display no alarm no nothing. In the for end it cost me about $15.00 a year alarm service. Positive: The sound was decent and it charged the ipod. Negitives: It broke, the clock led lighting was like having a lighthouse in your bedroom.Remote control only worked if you were 6 inches from the unit. Oh ya it broke, did already say that?"
2,Glitchy and unreliable,"I bought this as a docking system for my iPod classic so that I could charge and play music in my room. Several problems came up through handling this product. First, about a third of the time I try to use the speakers, it plays nothing until I unplug the iLuv from its power source and plug it back in and press play. Also, the clock always skips ahead 10 minutes just days after I reset it. Overall, it's not a reliable dock for playing music and telling time."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I've owned this for about 3 years and I'm shocked at how badly it has performed.First, the good. The quality is good for what you pay for.Now, the rest. It can't keep time. The clock loses about 10 minutes every 2-3 months and has to be reprogrammed. Can't believe that's an issue in this day and age. Second, the speakers now thump wildly if it is left plugged in. I googled the problem and it seems to occur with car speakers but I don't know how it can be fixed for less than the cost of replacement. The interface is annoying - buttons in strange places and not very responsive. The remote died after two years.I don't understand why this received such a good review on Amazon."
3,Little things can be a big problem....,"It turns out that while most of this works great, the display either is dark or lights up the room. (even on the dimmest setting) This makes it not work well for an alarm clock. After debating, we decided to keep it and also keep our old alarm so we could see the time at night. I wish that they would have a display like the Sony alarm clocks and the functionality of this one."
3,Wont charge ????,"In the technical details it said that it is compatible with ipod touch 2nd gen, but it is not. It plays the music but it wont charge saying it is not compatible."
1,Did not work with Shuffle!,"Specifically bought this because it said it worked with the I-pod Shuffle. After a few agonizing hours of trying everything - including my teenager helping me - it was not compatable with our Shuffle (2nd generation, even!). It's a nice radio, but that's not the only thing I wanted it for."
2,poor design as a clock,"I got this product to replace our alarm clock and double as a docking station for the 3G ipod touch I just bought my husband. The music-related features were fine (docking, charging, speaker quality, sleep mode, etc) but its a crappy clock design that doubles as a very bright night light.The numerals are gray on a gray background...difficult to read at night. And yet the background is lit very brightly, even on the dimmest of three settings. My 8yo who sleeps with a very bright night light loved that mom and dad's room was ""all lit up."" Me, not so much. I had to turn the light off completely to sleep and thus you can't see what time it is at all if you wake up in the night. If that's not enough...it also hums periodically and the buzzer tone sounds like a fire alarm, so I can't imagine anyone would want to wake up to that instead of music.It's going back. Bah."
4,Pretty Good For Money,"I have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts. All in all pretty pleased with the purchase. It was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my iPod Mini. There are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models. Panicked at first because they didn't have one for the Mini, but it was already installed on the model. Cons:- Light dimmer has three settings, but even the lowest is too bright. You can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote.- No ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week. For example 7:00AM Monday to Friday, no alarm on Weekends.- Wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset (by you) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle.- Sound is great for an alarm clock. Don't think it will compare with a mini stereo or Bose SoundDock.Would buy again at the price."
1,Don't even think about a i-Luv return,"For Valentines day 2008 my wife bought an i-Luv headphone for me. The ad said ""noise canceling"", but for my application I really needed something more serious with hearing protection. Well, she's been trying to return it for the last 5 weeks. It seems it's almost impossible to get through to a number, if you can find the number. Then if you you'll be really lucky to get a person. If you get a person they'll make a promise and you'll never hear anything again.I have never has worse customer service from any company ever."
5,Works great after one year,I bought this for my daughter last year for Christmas. Great buy and sounds great. My daughter is pleased.
5,Amazing!,"Hey! if you dont have money, but you want to buy a Speaker System that really make you feel proud of what you pay, you have to buy this one, you will remember me."
3,Wonderful Songs... Dreadful Sound Quality,"I became a Skip James fan after downloading some of his singles off of the internet including Devil Got My Woman, Hard Time Killing Floor Blues, Drunken Spree, and 22-20 Blues. I bought this CD with the hopes of hearing some of Skip's best work and while the songs are wonderful, the sound quality is not. Turns out that the recordings found on this CD were mostly made in the 30's and thusly are not of the best fidelity. I'd reccomend his 60's sessions to anyone just getting started with ole Skip. CD's such as The Vanguard Sessions: Blues From The Delta feature Skip's later re-recordings of his original classics and offer the listener a much more rewarding experience. While lacking some of the intensity of his original recordings they are, in fact, much more listenable!"
5,"For ""starved"" children, a nourishing, deepeining, experience","Mr. Bradley's book puts it squarely in the middle of fine fantasy literature for children, for us all. Through the welcomed element of Rite of Passage, its key character (well-anticipating the likes of Harry Potter) emerges a promising ""Dream-Shaper"" but more importantly choice-maker. An excellent book for the classroom."
3,Okay Album,"As usual, Jazz Oracle has done a good job putting together this album. The sound quality is pretty good for the age of the records thanks I'm sure to the great transfer and remastering work of John R. T.Davies. My main gripe is with the music itself. I've heard better music from 1925. In some ways the music is rather primative and I certainly can't stand the singing of Maggie Jones whom the St. Louis Rhythm Kings back up on a couple of numbers. All in all I can only mildly give my approval for this collection of music. I'm certain a serious collector would be happy to have this one. An even better Jazz Oracle album isRed Nichols On Edison 1924-1927."
3,arizona trail,a good guide book to the arizona trail but with disapointing photos but if you want a guide is what you want
3,The positives might outweigh the negatives,"Positives:1. It does make a significant difference in keeping your hand from getting tired when you write a lot.Negatives:1. The pocket clip, which you push slightly to one side to loose the retractable tip, wears out the edge of the tiny hook that keep the tip retracted and the writing point exposed, so the tip pops out spontaneously while you're trying to write and covers the writing point. Very annoying.2. The metallic paint on my pen chipped off a little in the most-touched places, exposing the gray plastic underneath.3. That price...ouch. Don't forget to take into account the shipping!"
4,Ergo-Soft PenAgain,Great stocking stuffer/office staff gift. Pen looks and feels upscale. It does take some practice to become comfortable using it. I bought one for a friend with joint pain in her hands who was very pleased with it.
4,ergo-sof pen,Chose this rating because although I liked the product the person for whom it was purchased for did not bebefit from it. Concept is good but person refused th recognize that it was a necessary tool to assist him in learning to write following a stroke.
3,Doesn't fit,"This is probably a great pen but I can't really say because it is made for larger hands than mine. I cannot grip it properly to write with it. How about a small, medium, and large?"
2,Disappointing,"I must say I was terribly disappointed in my PenAgain. I bought the black one from Walgreens and the mechanism broke within 20 uses. With the tip retraction mechanism malfunctioning, I can barely write for 10 seconds before the dang tip pops back out.I also wouldn't recommend the ergonomics if you have big fat hands like me."
3,Photography,"I was a little disappointed with the pictures. I was hoping for close up pictures. The photographer seemed to take distant photos. only one or 2 were a frontal view and up close, most were from odd angles."
5,A beautiful thing!,"The people at Som Livre in Brasil have sponsored and recorded a wonderful homage concert tribute to Tom Jobim [Antonio Carlos Jobim if you will!]. They have also produced a dvd and I believe it plays in any region of the world so you need not worry about Region 1 [USA]. Also most have English subtitles which illustrate how poetic Jobim and his lyricists were. But, the music! It is grand and each of the current Brasilian talents perform with marvelous talent. And the quality of the sound is sensational too. Like Bacharach here in North America, Jobim in South America wrote such grand material that it sounds great whether sung Bossa Nova style or Caberate or Rap!"
1,This Is Why Rap Music Is Dying!,"""Scribes of Life"" is at best a mediocre album. The production is not what people are hyping it up to be(Dr. J is a producer now.... come on!!!). The themes of the songs are so cliche, it seems like you are listening to an old school record. The lyrics... I don't really have to comment. His only claim to fame is appearing on Cannibus' album. Yeah, that's something to brag about. BOTTOM LINE: Don't buy it."
4,Early but good Film by Master John Woo,"When I first saw this film it was only because one of my fav. directors, John Y. Woo made it. But it is surprisingly good for an old lo-budget HongKong movie. The direction is all right and when the action turns on, you can see the master's handwriting. This film is gross but entertaining and it's worth a rental. Avoid the dubbed Version!"
2,Disappointed,"Just as w/ Hong Kong Face-Off (also by John Woo), I found Heroes Shed No Tears to be one of John Woo's weaker movies. The melodrama was tacky, the characters weakly developed, and the storyline lacking any logical sequence. Missing is that smashing cinematography that we see in later films like Face-Off or Hard Boiled, or the strong character development seen in Face-Off, Hard Boiled or The Killer. If you're merely browsing for a good HongKong action flick, skip this baby. If you're interested in seeing how John Woo's cinematographic genius developed and how he came to be where he is today, go to your local Asian video store and rent this movie. If you're die hard John Woo and wanna just buy anything by him, beware...this film isn't what you'd expect it to be."
5,GREAT compilation album,These are reworked samples from the movies and TV series. One of the best of its kind. I highly recommend this. Very faithful to the original compositions and some really interesting combinations and reimagining. Not a weak moment on the disc.
5,Wonderful,"I absolutely love this stuff. I can't praise it enough. I'll never go back to Windex or its knock-offs. Worth the money. I totally believe that if the windows of your home are clean and clear, it improves your mood. This is a product that makes it easy to do."
5,No Streaks,I have used this product for over a year and am very happy with it. I can wash windows and not see any streaks when the sun hits them. Also mirrors are easy to do with one application.
2,Don't even bother.,"A chopped up mess. The main character is a muddle, the secondary characters never get developed, and the ending is not worth the paper that was used to print it. My guess is that the author used bits from his earlier works to mash this book out and get another paycheck. I have read 7 of his books and liked 4 of them -- this one is the worst by far."
4,"Good, but not his best effort.","I have been a huge Gemmell fan since running across Legend in a bookstore in the early 1990's. One of the main reasons for my being drawn to Gemmell's work is the flowing movement of the stories and the fast paced action, in setting and dialogue, of the characters. Gemmell also has a talent of incorporating his views into character dialogue without overpowering the flow of the story. In The Swords of Night and Day, however, the points of human behavior that the author conveys in the dialogue of his characters seem to bog down the story at times, interrupting the flow that Gemmell is famous for. The book is a really good read, however I would not recommend it for first time Gemmell readers as his other works are outstanding."
4,Dorothy Grows Up,"I bought this album in 1980 when it was released. This has got to be her best work. I love an album that you can listen to from start to finish. Every track here is a winner. I remember seeing her in concert when I was about 15 and she held my hand while she sang ""I JUST WANNA SAY"". One of the best love songs of all time in my estimation. ""STILL MINE"" shows off her vocal skills (THIS GIRL CAN SANG YA'LL). ""DANCIN"", ""SWEET SENSATION"" and the classic ""NEVER KNEW LOVE LIKE THIS BEFORE"" can still get a house party jumpin. I've waited over 20 years for this to be released on cd and now I have it. Now that's a ""SWEET SENSATION""."
4,I cant beleive it,I cant believe this book is out of print this is one of my favorite books. I reread it all the time. Clearie has to move to alaska to live with relatives she has never met she has many adventures including landing some creep in jail. i love this book.
2,not deep,"this book covers a great variety of ships in a very superficial way, not all of them accurately, as for example the Viking ships.Most of it is a childish drawing and a description of one line."
3,Decent,"This story had a lot going for it: The tortured hero (if you like that), an independent heroine and some intensely emotional exchanges between them. I also liked that the hero was not a man-whore, keeping faithful to the heroine even though they had no committment yet.There were some things that bothered me, however. The dialogue, while not bad, would have worked great in a contemporary novel. Unfortunately, it just felt too modern to work in a medieval. Also, the heroine and hero both do a few things that make them look TSTL.Finally, the villains were very cartoonish. The ending was wrapped up so quickly, with a little slapstick humor thrown in, that it reminded me of a ""Scooby-do"" ending.So, to sum up, while there were some things that kept this story from being great, it still had enough worthwhile elements to make it a decent read."
4,More Good Stuff by Lara Adrian,"I love Lara's Midnight Breed series; once I finished them, I was hungry for anything she'd written. Her historical romances were great fun. She found an interesting way to wrap historical events around all of them."
3,Illogical Ending,Good story for the most part. One dimensional heroine but the hero was solid. Problem is with how the author totally ignores the true historical events in England. Author has hero turned into a baron without explanation or solving the problem of their political enemies. If yhe author writes about specific historical events then the story should be faithful to the time.
3,Good but still needing something else,"I loved St. John's Lord of Vengence and was eagerly awaiting this arival. Unfortunately, there was definitly something lacking. The main pair lacked a closeness and intimate connection that Ariana and the hero shared in LoV. Perhaps I was comparing it too much to the first novel, but I felt that there was too little interaction between the destined pair."
2,A disappointment,"I really enjoyed St. John's first book, Lord of Vengeance, so I eagerly awaited Lady of Valor. But I was disappointed. The dialogue was good, so were her characters, even the plot was original. What disappointed me was the writing. She relied on so many cliches that I've read in so many other romances. I just expected more from her. I forced myself to finish it just to see how she brought it to a close, but I did so by reading only the dialog. I really wanted to like it, but I didn't."
3,Nothing new here,"If you enjoy historical romances where the hero and the heroine fall for each other on page two and kiss on page three (on the day she is told her husband is dead, no less), where the Big bad out there is very bad, the hero very heroic and the heroine stands on her own two feet until the hero comes along and demands all control - then this might be a book for you. It's well written but had a few historical mistakes that I found annoying.If you, like me, are looking for something more, something out of the ordinary, a book where people don't behave as if they live today, then you might find this book a bit boring. I know I did.So it's not a bad book. But it's also not great. I didn't hate it - but I found it hard to like it."
4,Lady of Valor,This was a very enjoyable book to read. I really enjoy reading historical romances and this one was great. I liked the characters in this book.
4,Come on DJ put the record on the replay....,"This is the second single from the This is not a test! album(and probably the last). Includes the ""Remix"" version of Pass that dutch Ft Bust a buzz BUSTA! wich is cool but it reminds me of the Work it remix Ft. 50 Cent 'cause only the raps are the new thing, with no new music, is the same music from the original versions. I don't know why on Missy's singles they don't put remixes, the only remix that i have heard of missy is the Basement jaxx remix of 4 my people wich is great and one of my favorites songs from her."
3,early Argento thriller...,"while I liked ""Deep Red"" I think Argento has better films in his library, namely ""Suspiria"", and my personal favorite, ""Tenebre.""having said that, this is still a good film with plenty of chills and thrills. It is shot in his usual ""dark"" style, with low lighting.I think of Argento as the Hitchcock of Italian film. Enjoy this movie and his entire collection of films to get a better appreciation of the master filmmaker."
3,Bipolar Argento,"Argento is one of the best, but this movie is very up and down. One minute it's great and then the next minute it completely sucks. Early on in the movie you lose some respect for the lead actor when he loses an arm wrestling match to a girl and insists that she cheated. You won't have a lot of love for the characters in this movie because they show absolutely no depth or emotion. The bad lighting is supposed to help set the atmosphere but it is more annoying than helpful. However, Argento does demonstrate some very good camera angles that emphasize the use of shadow and light. He does instill some creative death sequences that make this movie more than a suspense thriller. The score does help move the movie along but there are some definite dull moments. Deep Red is enjoyable but do not go into this movie expecting a flawless Argento classic. 3.5 stars"
3,Doesn't live up to the hype...,"Being a huge fan of Suspiria, and The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, I was kind of let down with this one. The movie really drags it's feet with needless dialogue and the scares are far and few between. The additional footage is nothing more than conversations between the characters, and unless you speak Italian fluently, you're not going to understand what they're saying anyway. The music sounds like something from a Scooby Doo cartoon.There's a handful of brief scary moments, in classic Argento style, that get lost in a 2 hour snooze-fest."
3,Uh...strange!,"When a psychic mind reader picks up on the thoughts of a murderer, little did he know that he'd soon become a victim! An english pianist gets involved in solving the murders, but finds many of his avenues of inquiry cut off by new murders, and he begins to wonder how the murderer can track his movements so closely..."
1,not impressed,"""Deep Red"" is a disappointing offering from Dario Argento. The story is long, the acting is poor, and the plot seems to follow a pianist who is no more than a meddling non resident of the country, who is allowed by police to perform their job as detective. There were some artful scenes but they were not enough to hold my attention. I was constantly annoyed that the story would stall as if to add unnecessary minutes to the film. This movie put me to sleep and the only reason I went back to watch the rest of it was so I could give an informed review. Many of Argento's works are superb, but this one is a flop."
3,Pacing issues,"As with most Italian Horror, this one suffers from severe pacing and story issues. Some genuine interesting scenes and plot devices, but needs to be trimmed up. Could use a 2012 remake!"
5,A Must have,"I just love this film, Dario really went all the way for this one. Intresting story, good acting, amazing camera shots, some scary scenes. This one IS a masterpiece. A great place to begin for Dario newbies."
4,Very good movie...till the end,"Not gonna include a spoiler, but I feel they rushed the ending a bit. You never really understand the killer's motives. However, the rest of the movie is great.....with good humor and Great suspense. Dario Argento does it once again."
2,Horrible,The movie is long and slow. The uncut version is about 2 hours. The music sounds like it came from a 70s porn movie. The only good part were the original murders.
1,Masterpiece? Yeah right!!,"I truly am a fan of horror, even Italian horror. Esspecially since i'm Italian. I loved Dario Argento's work like Suspiria,Phenomena, Bird with the christal plumage. But come on deep red his masterpiece???!!!!We should all have guts to admit it, this movie is soooo DULL!!It drags on and on and on. And then the killer, it's hilarous!I even thought Phantom of the opera was beter than deep red, i really don't understand all the hype.If you want to see Dario's masterpiece check out Suspiria, tenebrea or bird with the crystal plumage!!"
1,Masterpiece of Terror - Horrible Version,"If you are a fan of murder mysteryand scary movies, then you must addDario Argento's film ""Deep Red""to your collectionor risk losing your credibility.If you do not know the workof the master Italian film director,imagine Alfred Hitchcock on steroids.Enough said.There is no point writing about this filmbecause you will get it,you will watch it (many times)and you will like it.note bene: the movie is dubbed in English,but occasionally is in Italian with Englishsubtitles; very strange, but not as bad asit may seem; apparently the Italian languageparts were cut from the film and thenreinserted for the uncut version,but not dubbed in English.Do not choose this version(ASIN: B000FAK9VA)The video quality is awfuland you will want to replace it.I did."
5,RED RED RED,"I saw this movie when I was about ten years old on a late night horror show, 1978 or 80, something like that, and have been dying-Absolutely DYING to see it again. this is a great flick that is a melting pot of what we would now call 'horror movie cliches, with a few surprises-even for the modern slasher afficiando, haunted houses, psychics, imaginative murder sequences (that haven't dated, not really) and a first class story that is hard to find these days. It is a Italian film though, and does have it's quirks (by American film standards), which fortunately adds to the creepy mystery of the story. It's grand, but no surprise to see David Hemmings in this film as it is only a further testament to the range of this fine actor. SEE it! SEE it! SEE it!"
4,An strong sytlish Suspense-Thriller.,"An english Jazz Pianist (David Hemmings) living in Rome. He witness a murder of a renowned Pyschic and he qucikly drawn into the savage crime with the help of a Female Reporter (Daria Nicoldi), the pair track down a bizzare twisted trail of Murders and Deranged clues and the relentless violence towards them.This film has a good lead performance by Hemmings. Cleverly directed by Dario Argento (Suspiria, Phenomena). The film is not for all tastes. Creepy music score by Giorgio Gaslini and The Golbins. Technovision. Grade:B+."
3,It's worth a try,"I thought this the best Argento movie I've seen. It had an actual plot, was strikingly beautiful visually and had a leading man that I recognized and he was actually good. I found it in a dollar store, but we've paid more for Italian horror that wasn't nearly as good. I would say that it works better as a Hitchcockian style murder mystery than as a slasher/horror film..."
3,Beautiful presentation for an average giallo,"Some feel that this is the best giallo made since the invention of the genre. Personally, I feel that it starts off with lots of energy and somehow falters around the first hour. Having seen 'Deep Red' in a uncut version for the first time on video about 10 12 years ago from a German 16mm transfer , I must say that Anchor Bay's transfer is in fact quite beautiful and colorful not unlike most Argento films. The extra 20 minutes or so added to 'Deep Red' isn't more gore but a sub-plot between David Hemmings' and Daria Nicoldi's attraction which doesn't really help the core storyline at all. Call me weird but 'Tenebrae' is still my favorite Argento film..."
2,Eh...,"After seeing this movie, I don't see all the hype. I bought the extended version with the English subtitles which bored me to death. I really hate it switching languages intermediately. Granted, the film did have me guessing all the way through, and it did have one good scene -- in my opinion, when the dancing doll busted through the door -- but beyond that, it's pretty boring. I won't suggest avoiding it since people have varying opinion's and tastes, but be prepared for loads of dialogue and drawn out scenes."
4,Deep Red is no Suspiria,"I've seen quite a bit of Euro-horror, and Deep Red is certainly one of the better films of the genre. Unlike Fulci (another favorite), Argento exercises just enough restraint, relying heavily on sound, atmosphere and slowly building tension--to call him a ""slightly more gory Hitchcock"" is fair. Deep Red has tension in spades. The film is gorgeously shot, with some nice panning camera angles, minimal, interesting soundtrack by the Goblins, a creepy, dreamy atmosphere and a nice detective/mystery element. Still, Deep Red is no Suspiria. The movie is a bit slow at points, the soundtrack is not nearly as jarring (the soundtrack to Suspiria might be the most legitimately frightening ever), and as pretty as the film is, it's not as otherworldly gorgeous as Argento's true masterpiece. A very worthy movie, certainly Argento's second best, but for the uninitiated, Suspiria is the best example of this excellent director's work."
1,Which version is this?,"There are two versions of Deep Red/The Hatchet Murder here but amazon has stupidly replicated the same set of reviews for both of them! Is this the uncut version with the italian language scenes that all the reviews speak so highly of, or is this the cut-to-crap not-even-worth-watching american version?"
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR A MOVIE IN THAT TIME,"NOT KNOCKING THIS MOVIE BUT, THE KILLINGS TO ME LOOKED SO FAKE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE IF IT WASN'T SO LONG DRAWN OUT AND THERE WERE MORE MURDERS THAT LOOKED REAL. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS FILM. I LOVE DARIO ARGENTINO'S FILMS BUT THIS ONE, TO ME NEEDED SOME MORE SPECIAL EFFECTS WORKS. MAYBE I GOT A HOLD OF THE WRONG COPY OR SOMETHING BUT, IT'S MY OPINION. I'LL LET YOU BE THE JUDGE WHEN YOU SEE IT! IM A BIG HORROR BUFF. I SEEN MOVIES FROM THE 70'S AND SOME WERE REALLY GRUESOME AND REALISTIC. NOT THIS ONE. BUT IT'S ENTERTAINING. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO'S DOING THE KILLING. DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO FIGURE THAT OUT EITHER. BUT I LIKE IT."
1,disappointed,"I took home my copy of Deep Red with much anticipation, only to see my hopes dashed by the fact that this film does not deserve all the hype.Granted the cinematography is beautiful, the lighting and soundtrack really add to the tension in certain scenes but THIS FILM IS NOT SCARY. I am not implying that a film has to be scary to be good, but a film hyped as one of the best from ""Italian Horror Meister"" Dario Argento should be. Stick with The Exorcist,Blair Witch or even the Wicked witch of the west from ""Wizard of Oz"", she still scares me more than this."
1,Masterpiece ... ?,"First of all, some of you don't even know which movie that you're reviewing. The Argento Movie, which is sometimes entitled ""Deep Red"" (subtitled, ""the Hatchet Murders"") is the DVD link to the VHS movie: ""Deep Red"" - which is a SCI-FI film, starring Michael Biehn, an directed by Craig Baxley! Amazon's database is screwed up on this movie, mixing up the 2 films.Second, the original Halloween was better than this junk! Argento's movie looks and feels like his first film after film school. Slasher movies must just be lost on me, if this thing is someone's ""masterpiece"". Parts of it are more comedy than suspense.You can really tell that this movie was made in the mid-70's."
5,Horror and Suspense Like No Other!,"I just purchased this film, ripped it out of its wrapper, and plugged it in, and WOW is all I can say! The whole atmosphere created is enough to make you jump!Add to that several VERY disturbing and violent deaths, intensely haunting music, and a good plot line, and you have a masterpiece! Never before have I jumped/cringed so much at a movie(and Im a big horror buff)! The wind-up doll,lullabye, and haunted house were also a very nice touch!"
5,for my husband,My husband has a very large video collection. This movie was on his wish list. He loves it. Perfect gift for a horror buff.
2,"Cheaply made, not up to par","I am installing quite a few new cable modems, so I've been ordering various lengths of coaxial cable. Most of them were fine. But this set, while a fantastic price, was cheaply made. The pins were not just bent, they were curled over when I unpacked the cable. I had to carefully uncurl and straighten them in order to get them to fit into the slots on my modem and cable connection. It was also difficult to turn the connections. I prefer to spend a couple more dollars and get a quality product."
4,excellent,"This is a soundtrack to a 1960s biker film called Helles Bells. Les Baxter is the composer.Les Baxter is not a household name, but music hardcore people know he is the epitome of big, Wagnerian lounge music going back to the 1950s--total cheese, but that is the Baxter in-joke.Helles Bells is not. This is not rock, but as rock influenced as most late 1960s non-rock scores got. If you think of the big sounds Stu Philips used on hisBeyond the Valley of the Dollsscore--more rock concept than actual rock, the comparison is close.I don't have nearly enough biker film soundtracks in my collection, and sooner or later I am going to have to beef this up for both musical and music-collector-ego-stroking-disease reason. But until I do, I am glad to have begun here."
5,Found my Mr. Right !,"Liz helped me get on the right track with internet dating. Not only did she help me revise my essays, but she sent me to LookBetterOnline.com for new photos. After I posted my new essays and professional photos, I got a ton of emails from great guys - and just married one of them! If you are looking for Mr. Right, this book is a must-have."
1,Don't Bother,"I was so disappointed by this book! All the author does is offer generic advice to the age old questions. Her answer to all problems is ""search the internet."" And since she did so much research it would have been nice to have a list of good dating sites and resources at the very least. Don't waste your money, you can find the same info. that's in this book on the web."
5,Simply the Best,"I've been using these potholders for years, and they are the only ones I use. I have tried others, silicone included. These are flexible making it easy to grip the hot pan, yet they protect both sides of your hand."
3,An old classic but go for the reprint,"This is a classic in the field on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and it is STILL used in our research lab. The pioneers figured out so much of the physics of NMR in the first five years of the field but, still, there has been so much development in the field over the past ~65 years and it has not stopped. New ideas and applications are fluorishing, for example, in medical MRI. Unbelievable. Students, postdocs, and even older NMR scientists will learn much from this volume.That said, this hardbound edition is printed on less than great grade of paper which is turning brown and decaying. I recommend staying away from it and, instead, go for the W. A. Benjamin reprint volume (1961) which is printed on much higher quality paper."
2,Arteriosclerosis and Hypertension,I was looking for more advice on high blood pressure. This book didn't have that. I won't advise getting this book as it doesn't have hardly any information on how to treat high blood pressure or the proper diet.
5,"""August and Everything After"" worth the price alone","The price is high for 3 songs and a video, but worth the money. The song ""August and Everything After"" is a rarity that I havn't heard before, and it is amazing. The video for ""She Don't Want Nobody Near"" is good, but the quality could be better. The only dowside one might have is that it's an import from France!"
2,NAVY SEAL BOOK BEFORE Bin Lauden,This book was a disappointment from beginning to the middle where I stopped reading and put it away for a better read. The book was slow and boring and I expected more from a writer who supposedly was/is an educated Seal. I was reading the book prior to the death of Bin Lauden so did not read it to get an inside scoop on tatics used in this historic mission. I have the greatest respect for all our military and was hoping for a 'good read' depicting our military in action.Team Secrets Of The Navy Seals
1,Not What I expected,I was disappointed in this Navy Seals books. Chapter after chapter I found it to be very repititious. Every chapter I read seemed to re-hash the previous one. Team work is nothing that I would consider as a secret. In order for any operations to be successful or for that matter any company that is successful teamwork is crucial and that goes for Managers who might not appreciate their employees. So although I respect Anonymous's devotion to the Seals there were no Team Secrets revealed in the book other than one instance of them training in the cold ocean waters. Very vague book. Nothing new here that I haven't seen in a war movie with men training in the military.
5,Best Leadership Book EVER!,If you want the ultimate team: READ THIS BOOK! This is the best leadership book I have ever read: PERIOD!
3,"Great concepts, average writing","I think the book itself is worth the purchase. The concepts used by the Seals are excellent for team-building. However, the writing is a bit dry."
3,This picture is not of the DC direct version,"Please note that the picture used in this listing is of the upcoming Batman Unlimited Dark Knight Returns Batman from Mattel. This listing is for the DC direct version which came out a few years ago. There will be definite differences in articulation, sculpt, and paint between the two versions. This is just an FYI."
1,HeMan Batman,"This has got to be the ugliest Batman figure I have ever seen, this is where Batman indeed has ""jumped the shark."""
1,HORRIBLE SMALL PRINT FOR OLDER PEOPLE,THE TINY NT FITS IN THE PALM OF MY HAND AND THE PRINT IS TOO TINY FOR OLDER PEOPLEI SHOULD HAVE CHECKED THE OVERALL SIZE. I GAVE IT TO A YOUNGER CO WORKER WHEN I CLICKED TO OPENAND LOOK AT INSIDE THE PRINT WAS MUCH LARGER AND I DID NOT CLICK ON ENLARGE OR ZOOM
5,Perfect carry bible. Tiny yet readable. Great translation!,The title says it all. Great carry bible. Easily slips into a pocket. NIV is a great translation.
5,the perfect gift,"I teach CCD and found this the perfect gift for young believers and new believers. Because people naturally start at the beginning of any book, handing a full Bible to a young or new believer usually just ends up ensuring they will NEVER read the Bible. With a pocket New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs in such an immensely readable and accurate translation, they begin with Jesus and end with the prayers Jesus Himself prayed.If you want to introduce anyone, and I mean anyone, to the joys and peace of the Christian faith, this product is where I recommend you start."
4,Backpocket fit bible,"Nicely fit to my back pocket. Font are large enough for me, no need of magnifier glass. Leather cover is acceptable, not the greates ever. Don't think I need to comment on the content, It's a Bible :)"
5,Spirit and Joy,"I enjoyed the CD very much -- I heard one of the songs at a praise service and I had to find it and to my very pleasant surprise the whole CD is qualitative good Christian music. It's not one or two songs to get you to buy the entire CD, this CD is truly a blessing."
5,Correction,"I just want to correct an error. This item is now published by Alta Book Center Publishers, not Alemany Press."
5,Well worth reading and highly recommended.,"""Following the success of her South African novel, 'Tarnished Idols', Marie Warder has gone to the other end of Africa for the setting of her new one, 'Samaritan of the Sahara'. Mrs. Warder's romantic imagination and facile pen provide plenty of local colour and she captures the reader's attention from start to finish. Well worth reading and highly recommended."""
2,Not enough instruction.,"The first 13 minutes are of dance instruction, but the rest of it is behind the scenes with no further instruction. And the suggested dance moves weren't really for beginners, but we did pick up a few things."
5,GREAT in a word,"Love this DVD! Can't say enough about it. You will love it to, young or old. Very good technique and fun too!"
1,Did Not Get What I Paid For,I paid extra for Christmas Gift Wrapping and a Note. The package was NOT Wrapped and NO Note was enclosed. The CD was a Christmas Present for my Mother. You can imagine how she felt when got one of her Christmas Presents from her son and it was NOT wrapped and NO card.Thanks for ruining one of my Mother's Christmas Gifts - AMAZON!
4,New Style Case,"We all know how great Stabila levels are, right? But there has been some talk about the quality of the cases. 2 or 3 years ago Stabila had nylon cases that were a little wimpy. This new case is a canvas exterior with a padded, soft interior. This case is far superior to the old style and my company has been very pleased with them. Those of you who have read my reviews know that I have tons of Stabila, including cases, these new cases are very good."
2,Dissappointed.,"After reading the great reviews this book had received, I bought it for our grandson. I was very disappointed in both the story and the artwork."
1,Lousy presentation,"The story is great, but I am returning the item because the book jacket is awful. I ordered a hardcover, and the book itself has no picture or title on the cover, only the book jacket shows the cover. That alone is odd, but this jacket is as thin as a piece of paper! It won't survive one year in my classroom. I've never seen such cheap, lazy packaging in my life. The pages are also thin and tender, they aren't strong glossy pages like most books. As much as I love this story, it's not worth the money because it won't last."
5,A fantastic fantasy book,"I've been trying to remember the name of this book forever to send it to my cousin. I loved this book when I was six or seven; I can remember my grandfather reading it to me. I recommend this book HIGHLY, and I am so thrilled to finally find it again. Where else but in fiction do complete meals rain from the sky?"
1,Text is too hard to navigate,"I bought this hoping to read it to my class at school. We are hard on our classroom books, lots of little hands...I had a unit to use this book and a study on weather...science and literature. Anyway, in the KINDLE form, this book is too hard to navigate for school. I am really sorry, I bought this book in this form. It is the form, not the book. Great story for kids."
4,age level,"You know, on Amazon this books is listed for being for reading levels 4-8, So I bought it for my nephew thinking that it would be very silly and he would think it was funny, but the book lists itself as being for readers aged 7-9. It is more serious than I expected, and the pictures are not as colorful as one expect a children's book to be. Still, very good, I will give it to my older niece instead."
5,Loved it Then and Now,"This book is my proclaimed favorite book of all my childhood. I read this book so much that I had to buy a replacement for it when I was 18 because the original was falling apart. I cannot wait for the birth of my daughter so I can read to her about the silly story of a town that receives its food from the sky until the weather makes a turn for the worse. The pictures still crack me up, and the detail is quite nice. As I grew older I searched for different foods and hidden details in the illustrations. I always liked the length of this book, because most bedtime stories seemed too short for me. I grew up an avid reader from a family with little time or money to keep me occupied, getting my amusement from books."
5,Great book,"This is an amusing and fun book for young kids, and can be a funny book to read for those kids who are in the stages of reading on their own.My 4 year old son loves this story, and laughs every time at the wacky happenings. The illustrations are great and really add to the humor of the story."
4,The children laughed out loud!,"I read this to 7 and 8 year olds in a second grade class. I had to explain some of the words, but the children enjoyed hearing and seeing the book. The illustrations are helpful,. I dont think it would stand up to re-reading to the same class, but it was a funny diversion between more serious and longer books."
4,"Really enjoyable, unique story","Okay, I bought this book so I could read it - my 2 year old hasn't seen it and won't for a couple years. I really like this story, it's entertaining and original - nice to see a children's book that doesn't rehash old story lines."
5,"Oh, the Weather Outside is Frightful.","I remember when I was in the first grade and having had this story read to us at library time. Everyone in the class loved it and every time when it snowed for the next two winters I looked outside and every once in while I thought I saw mashed potatoes covering the ground. I'm all grown up now and I still love this book, but kids still love it too. We were requested to read this about at least once a month at the day care where I worked.The story is full of imagination and the illustrations, though animated are detailed. The story is a modern tall tale and reading this book is like looking through a giant children's comic book. My favorite section is when the weather food goes beserk and there is a pickle in a living room, a noodle stuck on a man's head, a dog stuck to piece of pizza, and a hamburger stuffed atop a chimney. Stories don't get much more imaginative and creative than that."
5,20 Years Later & I Still Love This Book,"This was one of my favorite books when I was a kid. I read it over and over until it fell apart. Twenty years later and just the memory of the story still fills me with warm fuzzies and even though I don't have any kids, I still have a copy on my bookshelf. I've given it as a gift to every one of my friends' kids too."
5,Meatballs,Grandson loved it! His older sister knew the book from school and could read it to him. She was as excited as he was.
4,Fun,"I bought this without really looking at the target age (mine are 2 and 4), but they still love it."
4,Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,"A fun book with lots of wonderful, imaginative detail that is very captivating. Lots of writing, but even my 4 and 5 year old like this story. Pictures are fair and could be better. Overall enjoyable."
4,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is a book with very great ideas and some amazingly imaginative thinking that makes the readers fall into the world of chewandswallow. It makes you feel like you want to be a part of this new world where you don't have a choice of what to eat but are forced to eat what the weather brings you. The plot quickens when the weather turns bad and drops massive proportions of food all over the town. This book is great for not just little kids, but can be enjoyed by people of all ages because of its setting in this town of fantasy. I liked this book very much because it is a pretty funny story that sounds like a ton of fun to be in if you could. My favorite part of the book was when the giant pancake and shower of syrup close down the school."
5,Great Book!,"This is an all around great book! We have loved reading this book over and over. It brings a smile to your face and lifts you up! As authors ourselves, it is inspirational to see books written by other authors.Darla, Sydney and Jimmy Batchler"
2,Gift Books,I purchased 3 of these books as they are one of my favorites to give for the start of a library for babies to come...in other words to be given as gifts at 3 upcoming baby showers. The books arrived quickly BUT the covers look as though they had been dragged along the floor..one cover was torn and all are dirty. I have to give them as gifts as I have no time to return them. I am very disappointed in their appearance considering what I paid and they are supposed to be NEW...I probably should have gone to the local Barnes & Noble to purchase them.
4,WARNING: Reading Level Ages 9 - 12,"i ""searched inside"" the book, and liked what i saw. then, when i saw the first reader's comment about how she read the book to a 3.5-year-old, i sampled other reviews, then bought the book for my 5-year-old grandson.i would *never* read it to him now lest it give him bad dreams. but i learned my lesson: always check the age recommendations, for this book 9 - 12 years old.for that age and above, it's a terrific book--clever drawings, well-paced story, and full engagement of the imagination of children and adults."
1,Poor taste,"We got this book from the library and both me and my son could barely finish it. The whole story seemed like very poor taste to me and even decent illustrations could not save it.Sorry. I know lots of people like this book, but I am not one of them."
1,Seriously ? Five Stars ?,"I can't believe this book has 5 stars. . I'm so confused. I bought this book for my kids for Christmas after reading the rave reviews...and I can't express how completely disappointed I am. Rather than being ""whimsical"" the book was more ""disturbing"" with a touch of ""nauseating"". After I read this book to my six year old she offered to take it to her school and donate it to the school library. . . that oughta tell you something."
4,It made me feel hungry.,"I really liked the middle of the book, when big food and ice cream was falling down from the sky. Also the begining was weird."
5,Cloudy With a Chance of MeatballsTR,"I rated this book five stars because it was that good.It was it was pretty cool but,I mean that it was good.I liked it because it's cool that you don't have to go to a store and buy and pay for the food.It just comes down three times a day."
4,Son loves it,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this book. He reads it in his car seat when we drive. It's beautifully illustrated. A bit quirky, reminds me of a kid friendly Crumb book. He loves the movie as well but it is completely different from the film."
4,Cloudy with a side of third grade,"I first read this book in 3rd grade, It was my reading groups turn to be in th hallway, and the kid next to me was picking his nose. Our teacher thought it would be a nice break from our chapter books, before Spring Break. The pictures and story made us laugh so loud, the other teachers shut their doors. The story is even funnier if you don't look at the pictures and you just imagine it in your head (this can only be done when someone else reads it to you.)"
4,A great classic,"This book is nothing but the silliest tall tale ever, about a town where food ""falls from the sky"", but it works.My nieces really sit still for this one, which is sometimes a bit of an accomplishment :)I will say that it goes on a bit long in parts, describing the way food falls from the sky, but it's not that big a deal to me."
3,Funny to a point,"My kids thought this book started really funny. However, before too long they were losing interest as it was a little too wordy. The concept is great and the weather descriptions were funny to me, but a little above their heads. I think it would be better for children older than 7."
3,An Intriguing Album ...,"I am an Aussie (I live near her Mum!), and this album has been available in Australia since it was recorded. It was recorded at Bryon Bay which is an amazing surf spot and place of wilderness here. So it suits the album perfectly. if you are looking for an album commercial sounding - this is not for you. You would never hear any of these songs on the radio. But guess what? It doesn't matter! This album is the most honest, intriguing and thoughtful collection I've heard in ages. Compare this album to albums like ""Soul Kiss"" and 'Xanadu"" and you'll realise - this is much more our real Olivia!""Trust Yourself"" and ""Don't Cut Me Down"" will make you think about things in a way you may not usually hav time for.This album takes a few listens to truly appreciate it. It's best in the car - at night time or when you are lazing about the house.It's not the best Olivia album but it's the most intriguing and honest ..."
4,Gaia,This is one of Olivia's most personal albums to date. Don't Cut Me Down and Gaia are two songs which focus on the environmental concerns. Why Not Me talks about the positive attitude while having cancer. Not Gonna Give In To It polishes off the album by reaffirming life after cancer.
3,Needs more info on playing HOLDEM,Good for people that know little about playing online. Not much info on playing the game itself.
1,Crappy online beginners book ...,"I truly didn't learn anything new here. For those who play free on Facebook, FTP, Pokerstars or anyplace else this is truly a waste. Ironically enough I absolutely LOVE the Texas Hold'Em for Dummies book.I began playing poker three months ago. And primarily as a result of that book I have taken my poker game from a novice to one who regularly competes at micro-limit cash games and have made it very deep in tournaments having cashed 3 times. Just recently making my 1st final table.Skip this and get the other one.Texas Hold'em For Dummies"
3,lovely thing but no charger,"this is a lovely product for a very low price but what I really hate is to conect it to the computer to charge it with the provided usb cable.really easy to use the fm tuner not to good, I NEED A WALL CHARGER can someone mention a compatible one please....."
3,Fair to middling level,"This is just a simple instrument used for the establishment of elevations only. You can't, or shouldn't try, to turn angles or lay out building lines with it. This is not a transit, the sight tube does not tilt, and no degree markings are on the base plate. That said, the level itself is all metal and is pretty hefty and solidly built. The design seems a bit crude with the vial hanging exposed and unprotected beneath the sight tube and held by two spring loaded set screws.Out of the box, the instrument was out of adjustment. The bubble vial was not parallel to the sight tube and would always swing to the eyepiece side when rotated 180 degrees.Berger included instructions for correcting this, but the wrench to adjust the setscrew was missing from my kit. It takes a 7/64"" allen wrench, which luckily I had.The tripod will probably be fine for occasional use around my home, but I don't feel that the plastic latches will be very durable in the long run."
2,Disappointed,"I guess my disappointment is mostly my fault, I actually expected to get a decent transit for $150. For clarification to those of you who think the same thing, this is not a transit. It is just a toy scope on a tripod. There are no degree graduations around the base and the plumb bob mentioned in the description did not come with it. I have a plumb bob and they are inexpensive, but it is the principle of the matter. If I had it to do again I would have spent a little more $ for a good transit. I think I might try to trade this off at the pawn shop for the real deal..."
4,Transit level with tripod.,The product is well made and preforems well. It is a quality product. The seller shipped promply and I was able to go to work emetiatly.
1,Verry low end transit,"This level is the loooooow end of the scale, I can do it easier with string line level or clear tubing.Just my opinion but if you want to shoot foundations ETC. spend a bit more $$ & get something usable."
2,Kindergarten Reasoning,"On the topic of HOWS and WHYS of our lives this book is very generic and probably a good kindergarten course to give some hope. I feel there is much more to life and its happenings than to be confined in just 10 abstract general reasons. The writer truly comes across as someone with embedded western idealogy, that things are what they are on the surface. She needs to explore her spirt more in depth.Realise this that our lives and purposes are probably way beyond 10 reasons only, we could go into infinitude and many possibilities. The content itself is very limiting and it mostly deals with setbacks of few certain people.There are much better reads available on this topic. Read any book by Harold Kushner and it zaps you to our realties, or even ""making sense out of Suffering"""
2,Reader From PA,"I personally did not find this book too helpful at all. I do think things happen for a reason and I thought this book would give you some kind of profound reason that you could walk away with and say ""oh yeah"" I get it now, but I did not get that from this book."
5,Eyeopening insight into lifes challanges.,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself identifying with several of the reasons listed for going thru traumatic events. Great for helping find positive results from negative life experiences. Should help some people to move ahead and grow from difficult problems, and throw away their ""pity pot."" Life is to precious to sit around feeling sorry for ourselves and dealing out blame for our unhappiness. Like a quotation I really appreciate: ""When you lose, don't lose the lesson."""
4,People Just Don't Understand,"You can tell them over and over, but they just don't get it! There is a HUGE difference between Wicca--a MODERN religion, and actual, honest witchcraft. Riva is a witchcraft author--NOT a Wiccan, and absolutely none of her books imply that she is Wiccan in any way, shape or form. Basically, if you don't see the words ""I am Wiccan"", you're not going to be happy with any book if YOU are Wiccan; so get over it already, and stop wasting your money on non-Wiccan books. There are plenty of books out there for your religion!That said, this book *could* be more complete, as with all of her books. I would personally have preferred that she just compile all of her little booklets into one volume, it would make for a much better read!I enjoy all of Ms. Riva's books; she tells it like it is, instead of putting that sappy, happy-face-on-everything twist that today's Wiccan authors do. Facts are facts, and Ms. Riva delivers them and pulls no punches."
2,CANDLE BOOK,WAS NOT AS SIMPLE AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. DIDNT LIKE ITAT ALL. WOULDNT RECOMENT IT TO ANYONE NO.
3,Didn't work for me..,"When I bought this pillow, I thought I was buying a very comfortable pillow (due to my experience with memory foam stuff). However, this pillow is far from comfortable. I guess this pillow is only made for people that sleep looking up, but I tend to sleep to the sides as well as looking up. The pillow is pretty hard and due to its shape, sleeping to the sides is very uncomfortable."
3,Not as described,"Received this pillow 3rd week of November. It was barely 3 1/4 inches at the highest point of the large side. Advertised as 4 inches and this, along with the higher density was critical. I contacted the company to make sure I had gotten the correct pillow. They said that I had and that it should expand more now that it is out of the packing. I set it on a table and did not use it the first week. It is December 21st and I am still waiting for it to expand. If the height is important to you (attention side sleepers) avoid this pillow. The foam is nice and dense, It does not have that memory foam smell, but it is too flat for my use."
2,Fails to deliver,"If you're looking for a book that will definitively show you how to use BOTH NLP and Enneagram typing to PRESENT and Close more effectively, then SAVE YOUR $$$$The book is very well written and ID tips on each Enneagran style and the ""dominant NLP Patterns"" that supposedly go with each style are disclosed.Unfortunately after the reader has taken the NLP material into account, he still is left to guess too much how to adjust a presentation for the traits that comprise each Enneagram type..."
3,The Enneagram,"If you have already read books on NLP and selling, you won't get anything new out of it. It gets three stars because it introduces the enneagram and correlates the meta-programs to it, and that's something quite interesting."
5,Why you need to read this book!,"""Personality Selling"" peels more layers of the Onion. If you have read ""The Unfair Advantage"" by Duane Lankin,(xcellent book by the way) you will know what I am talking about. If you are on a quest for knowledge in communication then this should be your next book."
5,paul mitchell spray gel,"I received the spray gel very promptly.I have not been able to find this particular productin the stores in RI, they have other similar productsbut I wanted this one and I was able to find it easlyon the web. Very satisfied."
5,Go to cookbook,"When I need to plan a dinner for friends that are not foodies this is the first cookbook I choose. The recipes are delicious, easy to prepare and are not over the top. Every recipe has been meticulously checked and all have proven to be delicious. The book helps capture the feel of eating at the restaurant. The seasonality of the book's organization helps us northern new englanders plan an appropriate meal."
2,Reel air hose,"You get what you pay for, air hose itself doesn't last but a few months if that. It started getting holes in it near the end. Repaired the end by cutting off but it would literally blow another hole when put under pressure. Had to buy new hose to fix this issue. Wouldn't recommend. Poor quality hose."
2,Not the best Quality,End fitting (metal) on hose broke during hook-up to the air compressor . Was able to buy parts at local hardware to fix.
3,Poor quality air hose,"I like the reel and spring very much. I am so surprised they would put such a WEAK TROUBLE PRONE CHEAP AIR HOSE on the reel. My hose sprung a leak after probably 50 uses. It was only then that I went back and read the other reviews on the quality of the air hose. The way the air hose is attached, it is not ""just unscrew and buy a new one"". Given the quality of the reel, I cannot imagine the poor air hose was intentional, but it certainly was NOT tested."
2,"Nice Reel, Poor Hose","We use this hose about 4 times a week. It performed great for four months. Unfortunately the hose developed a leak at the end next to the metal connector (on the ""end"" side of the rubber stop).This is a flex point so is likely to be a point of failure but it never should have happened this fast.We have it installed indoors with no direct sunlight exposureWe never let the hose ""run"" onto the reelWe hold the hose by the rubber stopper to prevent strain on the end of the hose and our attachmentsWe only use it about 4 times per week.Yes we can fix it.The reel continues to perform well. I expect that we will have to repair the hose several more times before replacing it altogether."
2,Hose will have to be replaced,"At first everything was fine, reel works as advertise and I really liked it. But at last the hose is cracking and I got a hole near the end of it this weekend. After looking some more, there are a lot of cracks in the hose, so yes it will have to be replaced.It appears like this is a common problem looking at the other comments left so far. So I can re-confirm the hose will not last - only used it maybe 20 times or so."
4,Love this CD,"I am a big fan of Elizabeth Mitchell. And this CD with Lisa Loeb is also great. My 3 yr. old son loves listening to it. And I love it, too! The songs are so soothing, it is a great one to pop in on drives when I want him to settle down or nap. But if I want him to relax, I need to make sure to skip the ""Stop and Go"" track because that one is so much fun. We love dancing to that one! These songs are all just so good and this cd is a great addition to my music collection!"
5,Love this CD!,"Lisa Loeb's Catch the Moon is an adorable acoustic children's CD that is pleasant for parents as well as children. I am a pediatric speech therapist with an infant of my own. The songs are soothing and upbeat and I appreciate that the lyrics are slow and enunciated. Perfect for preschoolers, but loved in the early stages as well! I love the songs in other languages as well. Adorable CD!"
5,peaceful and easy listening,I am crazy about music that makes everyone happy...sweet and cheerful without being obnoxious. I also love Frances England and Elizabeth Mitchell...my kids (five and one) love them too! I use this music as a background to most of our day-to-day happenings like during meals and playtime and car rides. Great music.
4,Love the 2 videos!,"This CD is a little slow for my daughter's taste (she's ALWAYS in motion!) but I think the songs are beautiful. I wish the DVD had more videos...2 is not enough, b/c they are wonderful!"
4,remarkably helpful guide to Japan at war,"I'm amused by the comments that Ruth Benedict is outdated. No doubt she is--but where else will you learn about the philosophy of the Japanese armed forces in WWII? If you want to know why the Japanese treated their captives with such savagery, and why they routinely fought to the death, you'll benefit from reading this book. I don't know of any other that even attempts to explain these mysteries."
3,fine price poor package,"I bought this as a gift to my relatives. They should have a better way to make it looks better, not like a too cheap staff, regardless of the advertized magic efficiency."
5,LEVEL PLAYING FIELD,"This level is simple to use. I like the fact that the compensator ( the self leveling mechanisim) can be locked in place for set up and storage by pushing a button. It has a five year warranty. It also has a 1 foot minimum focus. Th pentaprisim is an extremely usefull feature for easy bubble viewing. It also includes carrying case, lens cover, plumb bob, allen wrench adjusting pins, rod, tripod, and instructions."
4,Pretty good,"I loved the apocalyptic aura of this book. The author makes Vampirism more than a state of being, he turns it into a disease that plagues New York City. I felt for the characters, one of whom has leukemia, an interesting blood-parallel. I found it quite eerie in parts, and would definitely recommend it for vampire fiction fans."
3,Not too bad....,"This book was creepy but not your typical Vampire read. It really didn't have alot of action but it was interesting despite that fact. Hunt, NY is a creepy little town with a secret. I like the fact that the towns people didn't blurt out their secret and that Ray, Emily, Larry and David pretty much had to find it out on their own. The one part that creeped me out was David's driver. I won't elaborate on it here because I don't want to spoil the read for anyone else. I would recommend reading this book only if you have an open mind and don't have a preconceived notion of what a Vampire book should be about. Just enjoy the read for what it is. If all Vampire books were the same it would be a very boring book."
1,Junk.,"This guy writes the worst stuff I've read in a long, long time. He has no feel for characters, plot, settting, et cetera. I do not recommend it."
1,Ad is incorrect,They advertise this as a Male to Male adapter. The VGA end is Female as it should be since the standard monitor cable is male. I tried to find this out from Amazon but they make it very hard to ask a question or change an order once placed. The cable works Amazon is flawed. Were's the customer service?
2,"I guess I'm not a ""Complete Idiot""","This truely is the ""Complete Idiot's"" guide to Solar Power, as much of the book is repetitive, ambiguous and impractical. There are a few nuggets in the book worthy of my money (for instance, an easy way to chart home energy usage and references for state and federal incentives) but, for the most part, Ramsey only explores solar power technology to the brink of what one can figure out for himself through common sense. Little detail is given, where detail would be appropriate, even in the context of a ""Complete Idiot's"" guide (except, perhaps, the constant reminder that Mr. Ramsey also has another book on the market under the ""Complete Idiot's"" series). I would not recommend this book for anyone wanting to know more than two or three of the dozens of useful things about solar power."
2,Not a technical book,"If you are looking for a technical book- this book is not for you. It is only for a reader with zero knowledge about solar power who wants to know the very basics. It does not delve deeply into any aspect of solar power, rather it covers most of the subjects at a fourth grade level. The author is more interested in putting forth his environmental viewpoint than in actually educating the reader about the subject. That's fine, except why would you purchase this book if you were not already somewhat environmentally aware? Perhaps more people care about the cost savings. Pretty much the title sums it up. Only a Complete Idiot would buy it. I guess that makes me guilty as charged. In summary, if you know NOTHING about solar energy, buy this book. If you want detail and schematics etc. buy a different book."
1,Little or no specific information in the book,"I bought this book because I was seriously considering adding some solar elements to my current home, and I'm currently planning a new home that I wanted to incorporate as many features as possible. Unfortunately, this book did little more than gloss over the absolute basics about solar power. While it claims to include the equations you need to design a solar energy system, that claim is grossly overstated. Repeated throughout the text are reasons WHY solar energy is good for the environment, but the author has done more harm than good by producing a book that doesn't enable anyone to really go out and do it."
5,gr8 buy,"great source of inf if you are thinking of start saving the environment and spend less money on energy, elec or gas"
3,Good Introduction,This is a good introduction into solar technology for the home. The problem is that this technology is changing so rapidly that any book is quickly out of date.
4,Learning about Solar Power,"If you want a plain English explanation of solar power possibities, this book is great. Its format is excellent and includes lots of diagrams."
4,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Solar Power for Your Home,"As a novice, after scanning this book, I am satisified I made a good teaching choice."
2,Better off with a pocket dictionary,"This is like a synopsis of a pocket dictionary for English and Portuguese like Collins Gem or Oxford Mini but gives you much less. The vocabulary is quite limited, does not go beyond Clothes, Food, and the other headings. There are some basic sentences but most of what you want to say is left out. For the sentences it would be better a phrase book or even better a proper course. If what you want is vocabulary at your finger tips then the best is a pocket dictionary. I have taken this vocabulary book back to the shop and exchanged it for a pocket dictionary. You spend the same and get much more for it."
1,"Shame on Amazon, Shame on the seller!","If you're hoping for the original Rollerball soundtrack, don't bother ordering this from Amazon. The product description is correct, the images are correct, even the packing slip shows the right information--but the product sold is totally different--frankly, they lied about which version I was getting. The release I received was the 2002 remake, which is nothing like the original.I paid a substantial premium for what I thought was the original item, and instead was sent something totally different.STAY AWAY from this product."
1,The description doesn't match the product,The description is for the soundtrack from the 1974 movie. The product sent by the vendor was for the 2002 remake. Don't trust this vendor to know anything about what they are selling.
2,Inferior to I Got a Woman of 2004 by Universe Italy,This limited complilation I Got A Woman: Early Masterpieces by Werner Last's Favourites Jazz of 20 songs by Ray Charles from his early Atlantic years 1953-55 is not to be mistaken for the excellent and similarly priced namesake compilation (UPC: 8026575135222) I Got a Woman of 2004 by Universe Italy with 56 singles released between 1949 and 1955 including all these 20 songs on Disk 2.
2,How could these people teach you a good form?,Those who purchased this DVD for sure noted a very bad form demonstrated by the team while doing regular push-ups (and other exercises.) How could these people teach if they do not show a proper form?
3,OK,"It is ok...I spend most of my time in the gym so i got this dvd to see if I could get into doing some stuff at home, but I still spend more time in the gym, but this is a pretty good dvd"
4,Good French art film,"The boys who play the two key roles, In Son of the Shark are quite convincing little sociopaths. Their plight seems to be symptom of an ineffective and broken system (ie. family, community, society at large).The pace, even with the action of vandalism and violence, is predictably French, which of course means sloooowww. However I really liked the film overall.The actual filming was dark, likely for cinematic effect, but a little too dark for night scenes. Although I have only seen this on VHS (apparently no DVD release) so the quality is always questionable.I would agree with reviewers who commented that they saw elements from 400 Blows present in this film.If you can find a copy of this film you should give it a chance."
3,A fairly good debut by Agnes Merlet,"I'm not sure exactly how to review this movie. On the one hand I found the antics of the boys (so innocently displayed) rather refreshing. I'm not being coy, either. I really do love to watch kids be brats. It makes me feel good about myself. The scenery was divine, but the story line seemed... lacking, somehow. It seemed as if Merlet, rather than making a political statement about the dangers of mistreating children (oh, the havoc they will wreak!) succumbed to just plain having fun watching them up the ante. Enjoyable, but not all that memorable."
5,Beautiful and peaceful.,Pure enjoyment. Exceeded expectations. Sound and quality of recording is exceptional. Can't stop listening to this. It is now one of the favorites in our gospel music collection of CD's.
4,Better than Expected,This is a used book in very good condition. The basics of oil pastel painting are clearly stated. I bought it for my adult grandson to encourage him to experiment with his art.
3,Don't know what I was expecting!,I needed something quick (and inexpensive) to view a bunch of slides. I should have saved my money and just used a light bulb to view the slides.
1,A true waste of money!,"I purchased this item to help me look at old 35mm negatives to decide which ones to develop. It may have a 2 inch lighted area, but you can just as easily hold them up to a light bulb or your computer screen. I am very disappointed and if I would have known this, I would have put the money towards something else."
4,Mini slide viewer,The slide viewer was worth the price for the project I had in mind. It was a good size and performed as needed. For a bigger project i would have needed a more elaborate viewer.
5,film strip viewer,"Following the death of my parents, I was elected to divide all the family photos between myself and three siblings. The viewer is invaliable as much of the material is 35mm negatives."
1,Waste of money,I used this view approx. 30-45 minutes and now it does not work.Do not waste your money!
3,"Not TMJ, but not bad","Tim Quirk and Jay Blumenfeld, the creative nexus behind Too Much Joy, are back as Wonderlick, aided by a stable of guest players and a drum machine.The songs retain the melodic sense of Too Much Joy at its best, with Quirk's lyrics and distinctive voice enhancing the comparison. ""Donner Lake,"" the lead track, is the most distinctive on first listen, but all of the tracks quickly become familiar.TMJ's strength was always most noticeable in the intelligent lyrics that yield greater rewards with time, and Wonderlick offers that treasure just as generously. William Wittman's bass and Tommy Vinton's drums are noticeable in their absence, but this is as close to a TMJ comeback as we're likely to get."
4,Worth the money,"Its no swiss but the multi-function knife works well. For the little amount it costs, its a good find."
3,Serviceable but not great.,"I bought one of these knives as a White Elephant gift and was impressed enough to order one myself. However, I used a different vendor.This knife came individually packaged inside a larger Amazon box with other items but it looked slightly used. There were scratches on the sides of it, finish was dull, the toothpick was bent in 2 places, and the tweezers were bent. The tweezer tip also is a little recessed which seems like it was worn down over time or a factory defect.This is just going in an an emergency bag so if I use it once and the outcome is positive then it did its job.I've had actual Swiss army knives before and this one has similar features but not the same overall quality or thickness of the metal. The knife has a lifetime warranty but also warns bending components could break them. I suspect that this knife will last longer if used lightly and infrequently as is my intent."
1,Junk,"I paid 1 cent for this item and about $5.75 for shipping. The item shipped in an envelope, the overpriced shipping was an obvious round about attempt to sell this piece of crap ""knife"" Because no one would buy this for more than a dollar.The knife looks okay, but the blades are extremely dull, I sharpened the main blade and it seems to hold an edge (Not for very long I would bet) I would be scared to use this knife on anything tougher than butter because it bends from side to side and it feels like it would snap. This would be a great gift for a young boy but if you're over 7 years old don't buy this knife."
3,"Very Graphic, Bloody, & Sexy... Yey Very Puzzling","VAMPYRES is a very graphic, bloody, & sexy horror film. It owes a lot of its success to the two beautiful female leads Anulka & Marianne Morris. The movie is beautifully shot, with bleeding colors, & shows beautiful scenery. It's aslo very suspenseful at times. Yet it's the logic of the story that is flawed. In one scene, the two vampires confront Harriet (Sally Faulkner) & say some sort of incantation as if Fran (Marianne Morris) knew her from a previous life. This was not touched upon later on before the movie ended with the possibility that it could have been just a dream.I thought that the movie had a lot of potential, but the flawed narrative of the story holds the movie back. The movie has a dream-like feel to it. Maybe it was all a dream, maybe it isn't."
3,Vampyres,"This is sexually exploitive, but normal for the time period. It is an interesting move. The use of knives instead of fangs, the vampire's lack of super powers were a nice detail. The lesbian sex was pornographic pandering to male voyeurs but overall the movie painted a believable picture of the unbelievable. Evil wins."
2,sloooooooow,very slow started the movie about 5 times and I don't think we ever finished watching it. 3 more words.
2,verrrrrry slooooow,I really liked the opening scene. but then i fell asleep.im sure i missed all the good parts but its sooooo freakin slow. this film is the cure for insomnia.
2,Too boring and predictable,"The pacing in this movie is very slow. The movie takes 87 minutes to tell a story that could have taken ten minutes or less. All of the elements that one would have expected in a film like this (violence, suspense, sex, gothic horror, etc.) are on the cheap side (both in quality and quantity). The sets were only mediocre, consisting of a mixture of the gothic and 70's kitsch. The film's saving grace was the acting and dialog, which for the most part were not too bad. Not deserving of its cult status. If female vampire movies are your thing might I suggest the Hammer productions ""The Vampire Lovers"" and ""Lust for a Vampire"", which are both much better than Vampyres."
1,Vampyres,"Only reason worth watching is the British Birds in this film,the movie starts right away with the ""Action"". lesbieaction that is! It is not scary as it is more ""erotic"" although the Brunette looks kinda of hot and ""exotic"" there is something bizarre about her in the face,as for the movie Acting is good,story is good but it just doesn't appeal to me other than that the full frontal/rear nudity most would still want to watch it. just another zany euro flick."
1,severly disappointed,"i was severly disappointed to this film. i had very high expectations for this film. the only good scene was the first minute were the 2 vamps were shot, besides that it was boring. i wouldnt even bother buying this movie"
2,Lame attempt at a good movie,"This could have been so much more. Joseph what were you thinking. If your intent was to make it horrofiying, it wasn't. If your desire was to make it erotic, it fell short of that. If you wanted it to fall somewhere in between, then you missed on that one too. Not enough nudity to be erotic, i.e. more naked Anulka. And not enough terror to make it scary, i.e. only the last few minutes are worth mentioning. All in all if you just shot Anulka naked for 87 minuets that would have been worth the price. What I'm trying to say is it was too slow, set your DVD's to fastforward on this one guys."
4,"Eerie? Maybe. Hot? Yep, pretty much","Vampyres [Blu-ray] was released in 1974. IMDB rates it ""X."" Oocha magoocha. At the time, it was probably well deserved, though today it's maybe a bit tame.Even still, it's not a bad movie. The viewer is left hanging a bit at the end, and the origins of the ""vamypres"" is not revealed, but the story presented hangs together pretty well."
5,Vampire Vixens Suck Blood,"Fun, little horror film is an erotic piece of high fashion trash; with iconic-models posing for close-ups and gothic dress-ups. In a 70s, just out of 60s style that is trailblazing cheese. Shallow, gory and moody. Great casting, photography and direction have cinematic passion that surpasses budget.Major cult following.... with reasonBD A/V bests any version"
3,Is that a cross in your pocket or are you happy to see me?,"The opening scene of Vampyres introduces us to our two main characters, Fran (Marianne Morris) and Miriam (Anulka). These two lusty lovers are writhing around as a sinister shadow approaches. The two are fatally shot. The sexual carnivores now lure unexpecting motorists to their castle to drink their blood and sexual recreation. Several questions quickly come to mind. How did these two become vampires? Who killed them? Why don't they have fangs? Why do they slash the victims and drink the blood? (of course that refers to the previous question) Why are they seen running around in the daytime? and What does the couple camping in the woods have to do with anything? In spite of these burning questions, it is an entertaining piece of T&A horror, with lots of blood, gore, and sex. Faithful followers of the Hammer vampire genre will be a little distracted by the digression from the vampire tale, but the nudity should bring'em around."
1,"oh no, not again...","Ok, we had the Three (real) Tenors. They were established well-known classical artists. Since then we were treated to three:CountertenorsIrish tenorsCeltic tenors (hmm... and the difference would be?)Black tenorsSopranosand now American tenors (have you heard of any of them)Wasn't all of that enough of milking the idea of three guys (gals) singing together? It's not like they're breaking any new grounds here.They do beat Russel Watson in terms of youthful charm though."
2,Always Left Out,"Why did you not include the tenors on the DVD ""Three MO Tenors"" in your list of tenors mentioned in this article?None of the Tenors mentioned comes close to singing American Classics, from all venues of American music, as well as Standard Classical Tenor Fare as the, ""Three MO Tenors""! But then, America nor the rest of the world knows that there are extremely GOOD, Black Tenors, that can give all the rest a run for their money."
5,Prima XL 1000 Hozelock Cyprio pond pump,"I have a 10,000 gallon koi pond and this pump is the best one I could buy. It not only is a workhorse pump but it is completely quiet. When you walk up to my pond you hear the waterfall, not the pump!They no longer make this pump so I bought 3 of them! The first one I purchased in 2003 just went out after 7 years of 24/7 perfect service."
5,red dots,"I have bought and used several different models of these Tasco red dot scopes on 22 pistols , they are very accurate , easy to sight in , and reasonably price , a bargain for your buck , I will buy more .Clyde"
3,Pain in the neck,"The pillow does exactly what it says in the promo - BUT it is quite large and much too stiff and thick. I tried it for several nights and was not able to sleep comfortably, it kept my neck at an uncomfortable angle. If it was a tad smaller and considerably thinner I think it would be great, at least for me."
2,Pah.,"Also, the book itself is complete crud, being nothing more tangible than one would expect to find in the National Enquirer."
5,ABT-Golden Years,"This is my absolute favorite version of this ballet. It is delightfully funny, beautifully costumed, and well cheorgraphed. Baryshnikov, Cynthia Harvey, Patrick Bissell, who could ask for anything more. I am completely sucked in by the beauty of such talented dancers."
5,Athletic Ballet,"This is athletic ballet at it's best! Baryshnikov is a bit beyond his prime, but still incredible! Patrick Bissell is not yet dead, and exceptional."
1,mis-sold item,"This DVD should never have been offered to buyers in the United Kingdom market. We all know that DVD's are manufactured differently for various parts of the world and this one was playable in region one only (i.e United States.)Unfortunately it was a complete waste of time ordering it, and I have now returned it. Amazon should be more aware of these regional differences."
5,Great Performance,"This is a great video of Don Q.Beautiful technique by amazing young artists.The Dryad Fairy took my breath away....she is amazing!This video is worth every penny for anyone interested in ballet and dance, ballet students,pre professional and professional dancers alike."
5,Cynthia Harvey is the STAR of this ballet,"I have seen many other versions of this ballet, but Ms. Harvey is superb. She outshown Mikail Baryshnikov. She is wonderful. I fully enjoyed the ballet, but most especially her excellent performance!"
1,invest in quality,I have had to replace 3 of these under warranty. Rubbermaid now requires that you pay $20 s/h to obtain a replacement mat.
1,Perfect book...for a child,"I don't really want 2 pages of every four dedicated to where I sat, what I ate, and ""place ticket stub here"" type of things. I just wanted a book to score games in...I got half of what I paid for. If you want a book to score games in and you are under 10 years old, then this book is fine. If you are an adult and want to score games, get something else."
3,"Nice, but not what I was looking for...","My boyfriend and I are baseball junkies, and planned a minor league tour of New England last year. I keep score at all of the games we go to, and so, I thought a new scorebook where I could combine all the information from that tour would be a neat keepsake. This book was good for that purpose, but wasn't quite what I wanted. I wanted just a baseball scorebook...this is more to take to the game with your kid, esp. if you are following one team. If I had kids, this book would be perfect. The scoring squares are a little on the small side, but then again I have a weird scoring shorthand. Great for kids, but not for the serious ball fan."
4,Luckey's 12th Edition Hummel Book,This book is very helpful if you are buying or wanting to know the retail price of a hummel or if there are any markings you should be looking for. Luckey's does give some extra information on some hummels that Miller doesn't have in his book. One thing that would be helpful is to have color pictures of the figurines since many times a figurine's color determines it's age.
4,Really good and powerful stapler.,"I purchased one for me & my supe. She said it didn't work for her, so she gave it away, and it works (as I knew it would). I love mine and am keeping it -- forever!"
5,Great stapler,"I love this stapler! It does a fantastic job and is rechargeable, which is a big plus for my budget and especially for the environment."
2,go for the cord,"Unless you REALLY REALLY need a cordless stapler, don't bother with this one. Mine worked great for awhile, but then it wouldn't staple without being attached to the charger, and now even that doesn't work. This item is only a few years old, and used maybe once a month to staple several hundred newsletters. It jammed frequently and would grab on to the paper and not let it go.A couple days ago I bought another Swingline stapler to replace it (mainly because that was the only brand electric stapler our Office Max had). Big mistake. This one is going back to the store because it does the same paper-grabbing routine, except in this case you have to eject the cartridge to get the paper out. Cheap Chinese junk. Speedpro #42130."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!,"The scanner takes your finger prints, but the manual and software are not useable. We have spent over 20 hours trying to figure this all out (and yes, we are IT literate) and we still can't get a suitable computer to unit link. I would NOT recommend this package until these problems are fixed."
2,Dissappointed,i was dissappointed with this product because of its pc software. the machine is good but the software is bad.
2,"Great Hardware, Worst Manual & Software","This would be a nice product, if it only had a good documentation, software and/or an easy way to get the EmployeeID and the time in a database independent format, so that at least you could analyze it yourself, and not be in a M$ blocked environment (MS Access and SQL Server). Don't waste your time with this, unless you only use Windows and don't need to check remote sites."
1,Should be zero stars,"Instructions written by someone who doesn't speak English... the device is almost impossible to use as a result. Additionally, the scanner is pretty crummy, usually requiring 4-5 scans to identify an employee. I'm sending it back and you will too."
4,DVD Review,"A good supplement to workouts at the gym.I received it in a timely manner, and it works perfectly."
1,Waste of money,"These teachers are extremely annoying. The teaching is poor-- the routines are not even equally balanced on both sides of the body. So the workout, which is not very challenging anyway, is one-sided, using one side of the body more than the other by a large margin. I gave away the tape after using it once and will never buy any products by these instructors again."
3,A simple twist,"Diamond men is a simple film. A simple premise, simple script, a simple cast. What makes it entertaining is the splot twist in the end and robert forsters acting, which i love. The rest of the film is not that amazing, the problem being, its just not original. The premise of diamond selling is unique but it would have been cooler if they were diamond thiefs instead of legit salesmen. Oh well- its entertaining for popcorn film watching on a cozy friday night with the kids or loved one."
2,A sleeper to sleep to,"I coudn't finish this film, and I didn't think it was interesting at all. Honestly, the acting seemed forced, and there wasn't any sort of play between Robert Forster and Donnie Wahlberg, which seemed to be the main focus of this film. Just a seriously calmed down older guy and a cliché young guy who wants to have sex with every girl he meets. Most of what happened in this movie felt unnatural to me, and never surreal enough for that fact not to matter. At least take the time to learn what to expect if you plan on watching this, because it sure didn't grab me at all."
4,Pleasant suprise!!,"Wow. I had no expectations going in to this movie. I rented it on the strength of some reviews on the DVD cover. That's always a dicey prospect, but the reviews were by large publications that I've actually heard of, so I gave it a go.What an honest, perfectly acted little movie! Donnie Wahlberg is really good as the hotshot new employee about to replace the ""older guy"". But the anchor is Robert Forster. His acting is so good that it's like watching a person you're friends with. I can't say enough about this natural, real and heartfelt performance. Kudos to everyone involved in this entertaining, well-acted film."
4,Dark Angel Episode,I am watching the Dark Angel episode and I notice the audio and video are out of sync. the actors start talking and 1 to 2 seconds later the sound kicks in. very distracting.
4,Amazon makes good,"The issues with the first run release seem to have been fixed-order with confidence. Now, where's season three and four?"
3,"When I buy a complete season, I expect a COMPLETE season","I pre-ordered, so I got this for the lower price. I was willing to pay the initial $39.98 price, too, but was happy to pay only $29.99 even with the delays in releasing the item.However, when I purchase a full season set of DVDs, I expect to have the full season. Yes, the episode that was left off (The Choice) was a clip show, but it still does have some elements of a new episode and it doesn't make any sense at all to leave out the last episode of a season.The video transfer is good quality, and the sound is good. I was disappointed a little by the packaging but that is a minor point. But I really dislike not getting a complete set when that is what is being advertised. I hope that those of us who purchased the incomplete set are given some way to obtain the missing episode (and a box for it) free of charge."
1,Score for Legacy packaging,"I have never heard of Made to Order (which I didn't notice in my excitement at finally getting to order PTL Season 2) - so I was panicking a bit when this DVD set arrived as it looks totally home made, thought it was a pirate copy. Plays OK, but the packaging is rubbish, and there are no subtitles. Not good enough for nearly $50, looks like someone has made it on their home computer and photocopied the cover - colours very watery. Also came in 3 shrink wrapped DVD cases glued together - no proper box. The Legacy is brilliant, obviously, and I'm thrilled to be able to watch season 2, but the presentation of this set is shocking. I would hope that if they ever do a proper release now we have shown that people will buy it, Amazon would replace this 'demo' set for free."
4,Good Picture and Sound,"I'm one of the lucky ones who pre-ordered this at $29.99. Jill Moody's review is right on. The episodes seem a bit grainy at times, but I think that's purposeful---- to add to the mystery of the show. The episodes are indeed out of order and my disc #11 is also missing ""The Choice"" episode, but I think Amazon and MGM will probably make it good. I sent them an email and will let everyone know how things stand. But frankly, with the exception of the missing episode, I'm pretty pleased with the set.ADDENDA 3/8/10: I talked to someone in Amazon's MOD department and he said they had read the reviews on the sets problems. They said they would definitely contact the company that manufactured this set and ask for a re-do. How long that will take is anyone's guess. But I've always believed in the ""bird in the hand"" philosophy and will keep my set until the problem is solved.JF"
2,PRICE WAY TO HIGH,I love this show! I've been waiting ages for Season 2 release! Please Amazon lower the price! A release from MGM would be more to my liking but I will definitely buy if price is lowered.
1,Not what I expected,"The problems with this purse are: no zippers so everything dumps out from the center. The strap was not theft proof, the purse is too narrow and too tall so it is hard to find anything in it, and finally the place you put your credit cards does not zip so they were always dumping out. I ended up buying another purse on my trip and using it. This purse just did not work for me."
4,Excellent birdies,"Stable flight, speed and weight are good. Also it is durable. $18 is reasonable price but $25 is a little high."
4,Towel Review,"Looking for a fun towel for our new bar in our basement, this design fit. Great towel. Wish there were more fun designs for bar decor."
5,Very Useful,"This tool has proven very useful. Unlike some other laser holders/height adjusters, this one has several features that make it very accurate and customizable to your needs. The integrated tape allows fine adjustment of the height of the laser from the Laserjamb itself without the use of a tape measure. The pin stop system allows you to create your own stops by drilling into the laserjamb (instructions and drill included) at your chosen height. Once the holes are drilled the laser jamb can almost instantly be reset at these heights time and time again. I use the Laserjamb with a Robolaser and have found it indispensable."
2,AntOnline Not Cooperative,"The heater arrived with the box having been opened & resealed. In the description, there was no mention of the extra 5 inches of space required for safety all around the unit. I contacted AntOnline regarding swapping and they referred me to World Distributors, who referred me back to AntOnline. Bottom line, neither would exchange, leaving me with a heater I can't use."
3,Concept Fine but Poorly Described in Specs,"It is not what they told me, it is what is not included in the description/specifications.For example, not said is that it should not be run on a 20 or 30 pound LPG tank but a larger one not commonly found in the average household. Second, it requires additional hardware to connect it properly. Also, my mistake here, I was not thinking that pizio start was for a pilot that burns when not set to producing heat. The unit is not pilotless but that is my mistaken hope that it would have electronic start of the main burner unit. I can understand that feature is not sensible for a unit of this type though my shop heater tied in to natural gas with a large blower has such ignition. But the lack of information did not prepare me to have the materials on hand to get it running and I felt mislead. It may be a good device for me some day but I purchased something else for use in the meantime."
2,Don't forget the new edition...,"""Lonely Planet: Southern Africa"" is more complete (it covers the entire area from Zambia and Malawi to South Africa) and more recent (September 2000)."
4,"Skate Legends, by Michael Brooke","I have skated since the mid 70's. I know that skateboarding is very ""now"" oriented, and always has been. The problem this presents is that history becomes lost very quickly. Michael Brooke's book does its best to lay out the decades and sets up notable skaters from those eras. Is it every notable skater? no. Is it possible that your favorite may not be in the book? it's possible. But, that does not make the book a bad book. The book demonstrates that skating existed pre-1990 and has had a history worth holding on to. I feel that older skaters will get more enjoyment from the book, because it brings back memories. New skaters, if they are really in it for the long haul, can see what they are getting into and learn some of the names of the earlier days skateboarding."
5,a great man,"I have been lucky in that Grand master Yu has tested me for every rank of my Tae kwon do yong do won belts i hope to be tested for my black next, for the last ten years i have often heard him speak to us.all his talks where nothing short of movingand i am honest when i say this man almost has a sixth sense when it comes to reading your souli have never been able to hide my weaknesses from hima truely moving man"
2,Audio Fidelity Shouldn't Have Released This Version,"Even the man who remastered this version of the Pretenders' first album admits it's a disaster.He won't even allow any discussion of this gold CD on his Web site. I inadvertently started a thread on this disc and it was subsequently removed by one of his brown-shirted minions.In short, just get the regular aluminum CD. Audio Fidelity's gold CD is a rip-off and should be avoided. As my title says: this disc should never have been released by Audio Fidelity and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves."
4,The Pretenders Debut Album Review,"One of the best debut rock albums I have heard. Dont get me wrong its a good album but not great. The first opening track is an average/mediocre song so is the next track phone call. A few nice soft songs on the album like brass in pocket and kid. But the highlights of the album in my opinion are there 2 dreamy sort of melodic songs which are ""Up the Neck"" and ""private life"". This album is definitely worth adding to your music collection."
5,The rave reviews are right...,"It defined an era, was an exceptionally tight band, and Chrissie is a punk goddess...Listening to this defines being 18 and falling in love for me. One of my top ten, stranded-on-an-island albums, and that's saying a lot..."
4,Love Patricia Cornwell,Any book that you can get your hands on of Patricia Cornwell is worth the read. Scarpetta series is Great
5,great book,"As a Kay Scarpetta fan for many years, I was excited to find this book available. I haven't had the time to read it cover to cover yet, but I have paged thru and can't wait to read. I am looking forward to Patricia Cornwell's newest Scarpetta novel--""The Bone Bed"""
2,Read like a college essay,I must disagree with all the other posts. I thought this movie offered little insight and read like a college level book report. This book simply did not do justice to the rich material found in the books.
5,Excellent Songs,"Songs of our Soul is one of the earliest Columbia albums that Johnny did after leaving Sun Records. I have it on vinyl, and there are some absolute though rarely heard classics such as Hank and Joe and me, Drink to me, Great Speckled Bird etc. If you like Johnny, and you like that old time country style with the Jordanires-type background singers, this one is for you."
5,eytan mirsky the best,"the cd was awesome, eytan is a very good writer very underrated, a must have, the cd rocks"
3,Great speaker - but hard to install as a center,"We selected this speaker as a center channel for our home theater system. The sound is fantastic, but because of the size, it won't fit between two studs, so you end up having to cut studs and frame around the speaker. It would be a 5-star product for vertical installation (which would be EXTREMELY easy, but for horizontal installation...Let's just say that I would probably choose something else if I were to do it again."
5,From one Cat lover to Another,"I have read most of Kinky's books, and not that long ago, one of our local tv channels ran this documentary. I enjoyed it so much, that I was wondering when it would come out on DVD, now it has. If you are a Kinky fan, this DVD is a must. It fits right in with his books, and gives the viewer a good look at the real man behind the stories. A man who's heart appears to be just as big as his home state of Texas. His sharp wit seems to be excellently timed and fits into a lot of what is wrong with the country today. I for one hope that he does become the Lone Star State's next Governor in 2006. Don't stop Kinky, a lot of us are counting on you, all of us little guys in Stetson's and Tony Lama boots. Even in Australia, you have a lot of fans."
2,"Size Of The Ocean, Shallow As A Puddle","Revisiting this album due to gushing [...] reviews, and thinking I must have missed something when it was released in 2001, I couldn't make it past the fourth track due to rising irritablity, which was not quite as far as I got 6 years ago before deciding it was a perfect example of another overrated underrated Australian band. Someone has actually put this very unremarkable middle of the road rock album on the same list as Bellavista Terrace by The Go-Betweens; did you even listen to either of them? Granted, ""Hibernate"" is a promising opening track, but it's all downhill from there.When a band is Australian and/or of the ""indie"" variety, it's okay to admit that they don't have much of a following for the most obvious of reasons...The 2 stars are for the pretty picture of snow capped mountains on the album sleeve."
4,A wonderful reprint,"I'm no calligrapher. That said, I've a deep love and appreciation for penmanship and also for reading and learning about antique script hands. This short work by one of the greatest engravers and calligraphers ever is a wonderful read, a fun way to practice penmanship (as an advanced study)and a rich (if by no means comprehensive) source of samples for persons interested in 18th Century engraving, handwriting and calligraphy.I can't imagine recommending this little book to beginners. For one thing, Copperplate (the writing hand of the 18th Century)is not a hand most people learn in grade school and use as kids. Thankfully, there is a real revival of interest in Copperplate scripts and for those of us who are already trying their hand at Copperplate, and perhaps working with some other calligraphic scripts, this book is quite a good resource -- one of two by Mr. Bickham reproduced by Dover Publications."
3,NOT THAT BAD,"The movie was written, produced, and starred Curtis 50 cents Jackson as a Detroit gun dealer. In the first scene there is a strip joint with pole dancers who keep their clothes on. A hit is done outside the joint as Jackson kills his competition in the drug trade. The Mexican Cartels need lots of high powered guns, which Jackson claims he will provide. His connection is the pretty Annalynne McCord who also has sex with Jackson, the author of the script. Meanwhile Val Kilmer is being released from prison and goes to work for Jackson, a man who he once saved in a street shoot out. Danny Trejo is on the screen for about 3 minutes, nothing to write home about.The cops along with their rival, the ATF are after the gun dealers. Their role was done rather poorly while the thugs was done well, a reflection of what 50 cents really knows well. Hip-hop background music, no surprise. No nudity, quick sex scene, multiple MF and F bombs."
4,Rated LOW because violent but actually a GREAT ACTION video,"The story line is simple. They are looking for a stolen revolver used in a murder. I saw it as creating a STONE COLD KILLER looking for revenge for the killing of his wife while being forced to help the police. The main action involved a police captain forcing our ""hero"" to become a snitch. To do this he had to risk his life to prevent the captain from framing him sending him to jail and not being united with his daughter. There is definitely more killing than a Stallone movie but the action is exciting and I like the ending. ."
4,great movie,got this from bestbuy and loved itits more about runin guns then gangsdid not like Val Kilmer in itmust see if you like 50 cent
3,Gun (50 Cent) region locked,"This is a warning: the title of Gun (50 Cent) is LOCKED on 'A'. This would mean for those in the UK or for those in Australia as it won't play and this is even though on the cover it says 'ABC' for region free. Well, the film not bad, only average and what do expect from a lame actor by the name of Curtis (50 Cent) Jackson."
1,Stupid pointless and plotless movie,I am a huge 50 cent fan and was very excited to buy and watch this film. You get the feeling that you missed the first hour of the movie from the get go. There are a ton of plot holes leaving you to just assume you know whats going on. The script does not allow you to get close to any characeter so you really don't care about any of there fates making the movie pointless. It had potential to be a good movie if they would have let the story develop and not rush into all the action. I am very sorry to say that this movie is not worth your valuable time and it sucks!
1,Gun? seriously. . . .,"Omg this movie sucked balls, the plot was pointless and the lack of action. . .I fell asleep twice trying to watch it! Its really that bad, val kilmer you really fell off making this movie, please please stop making this striaght to dvd bull(bleep)!"
2,Don't be misled by positive magazine reviews.,"I decided to purchase this product after reading glowing reviews in various computer magazines. I was looking for an alternative to Norton after I had some problems running it under Windows ME. SystemSuite did not prove to be any more stable under ME. Thinking the problem was Microsoft's fault (which may still be partially the case), I went back to Windows 98SE. Unfortunately, SystemSuite's performance did not improve. It crashed repeatedly under Win98, whereas I never had any such problems with Norton under 98. Further, I found SystemSuite is harder to understand and control. And the clean up facility does not appear to be safe. I will not be reinstalling this on my system, and am returning it to the manufacturer for a refund. Trust me - stick with Norton."
2,Dangerous Mixed Utility Bag!,"This product has one of the best system repairs & restores. IT HAS ONE BAD UTLITY THAT SHOULD NEVER BE USED! NEVER, NEVER, NEVER LET it erase files it thinks are UNECESSARY! It has seriously messed up one of my computers. I had to hire a repairman for a FULL REFORMAT! The unused file removal program should NEVER be on this program! My repairman told me Norton used to have the same problem."
1,Tech support is nonexistent,"I've struggled with this product for over a year now. FinallyOntrack support decided to tell me that they don't support SCSI.Since this is listed nowhere on the box, in the documentation, orat the web site, I'm in the process of trying to get a refund."
3,FYI: if you are a breast cancer survivor,"I am a breast cancer survivor and experiencing hot flashes due to tamoxifen usage. A friend recommended this to me however on the World Botanticals site it warns anyone with hormone dependent cancers to first consult with their doctor. Just wanted to pass the info along...if you are a survivor of HER2+ (estrogen positive) cancer, just FYI. I have not used this product yet but am considering it after I speak with my oncologist."
1,Kiss the brown ring,This music is too pathetic. The artist is an enrique inglesias wannabe who has no clue as to what good music should sound like.
3,"Good Intention, Not the Best Invention","I've been using ""the other ergonomic pen"" but was hoping to find a product that was retractable - ergo, PenAgain. However, the angle needed to write with a PenAgain ballpoint was very unnatural, almost perpendicular to the paper, and the wishbone portion didn't fit my index finger making my thumb the stresspoint."
3,Nothing Great; It's OK,"I got 3 of these along with the yellow highlighters as well and was really excited to get them. I decided on them because I have nerve damage in my right arm and writing, for me, is very uncomfortable (if not downright painful). I was hoping that these pens would help me to write out checks, etc., but I truly see no difference between this pen and a regular pen; other than a different way of holding it. I truly don't think it was worth the extra cost of these pens over a regular, good quality pen. I gave a 3 for the score because I kind of like the yellow highlighters; they are a bit easier for me to use than a regular highlighter. But, as for the pens, I'm sorry to say I see/feel no difference!"
3,Nice while it lasts,I received this pen as a gift and it was really nice. It came with three replacement ballpoint insert thingies. Then it ran out of ink when I started using it alot for school. I replaced the ballpoint ink holder thing that it came with and nothing happened. It didn't work. It wouldn't and still won't write even with a new insert. So if you want to write for a long time with this pen and refill it don't buy it and don't count on it.
1,The designer needs to go back to the drawing board for this one,"These looked like a good idea but they are so uncomfortable. I am left-handed. I don't know if that's why they don't work for me, but they don't work for me at all."
5,GRIP-EEZE!,THIS PEN ELIMINATES WRITING WITH A TIRING GRIP ON THE PEN. THE WEIGHT OF MY HAND IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED FOR COMFORTABLE WRITING. THE PEN FITS EASILY INTO A POCKET OR YOU CAN STILL TURN PAGES OR ARRANAGE PAPERS WITH THE PEN STILL IN YOUR HAND! I THINK JUNIOR HIGH-HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS CAN BENEFIT WHEN USING THIS PEN. A PENCIL VERSION WOULD BE GOOD FOR ELEMENTARY STUDENTS WHO DO NOT USE PENS AS A RULE.
2,Not helpful,"In theory, this pen should be great for someone with arthritic hands, but in my case, I have arthritis in my wrists and this proved to only cause more pain. My husband has arthritic fingers and he seems to use the pens more easily."
3,"package opened, pen smudged","Aside from the item and its features, the first detail that caused frustration was the fact that the package was not sealed (the other pen's was, as should be), and the pen showed smudges all over its surface. I was not too thrilled with this purchase because of the mere knowledge that nobody cared enough to send me an unopened package. I lost my enthousiasm, and have not used the pen at all. I lost respect for the merchant. I also did not feel like having to go through the hassle of returning it. But it is the very principle that saddens me and makes me mad at the same time. Treat every customer right, without exceptions!!!"
4,"good deal, cool mini black light",I got a good deal on this product. it was fun and came with a cool mimi black light and putty to put the stars up. enjoy!
5,product has high quality,"product is of exceptional quality, fits well and the measurements listed on the site are accurate"
5,Yummalicious,"I LOVE this stuff. Happened across it in the snack food aisle at my local supermarket. Satisfying crunch with a nutty and salty flavor, chock full of fiber and protein. The Wasabi are a bit hot for me (not every bite, but man can it make your eyes water). I can't wait to try the Goji blend. I keep a bag in my car, in case the munchies hit. =) Way to go Seapoint!"
1,Disappointed,"I've purchased edamame from stores before, but decided to buy in bulk for price reasons. I was hoping Amazon would be the perfect place to do just that, but when I received my edamame, nearly every bag was torn and/or had holes in it! Loose edamame were rolling around in the box everywhere.Love the product, don't love the way I got it."
2,Pleasant taste - made in China - not organic,"What do we know about produce from China? That's right - major pollution. So while these taste OK, once I found out that they were from China (and not USDA organic) they went right in the trash."
