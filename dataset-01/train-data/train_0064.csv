3,Recognition of a man that opened our western eyes,"James Clavell has always played a key part in the way my life and career developed. His books opened my eyes to exciting and exotic cultures, and based on the strength of that (and whatever change I had in my pocket), I travelled the world and both worked in and visited the same places he featured in his novels. I do not wish to add praise to his literary merits, but I do wish to say - that in my life - he has had tremendous influence, brought endless hours of enjoyment, and provided a road map to discovering the world."
2,"""Tell Tale Heart"",a common story of a lunatic killer.","This story is an ordinary thing that happens in the world today.It might be such a great story in the past,but now there are lots of story about a mad man/woman who doesn't born to be a killer,but they kill somebody just because they wanted to for some reasons.So it's not that much interesting for me in its theme,but the way Poe wrote it is more interesting.He made us feel as though we are watching the story happened not just reading it.I like the way he wrote it.So I think it's worth reading Edgar Allan Poe's story."
3,A bad ending,"I don't like this story so much. This story showed me about a crazy man. He killed the old man because he didn't like his herrible eye,is it a reason? When the policesman came to his house, first he told them it was all right. Later,he looked strange,and he changed his mind. He let the policeman to find the old man's corpse,he made the old man to sevaral parts. Oh! There were something wrong with his head, that was true,he was crazy. So the policeman shouldn't put him to death, they aould send him to a doctor. What about the old man? Did he do something wrong? He died like that? I don't like the ending of the story,and I don't think it's enteresting. That's my feeling."
1,Classroom use.(discussion of painter Pablo Picasso's Weeping Woman): An article from: Arts & Activities [HTML] [Digital],"I was quite disappointed with this. For $6 dollars, it was less than 1,000 words and rather than discussing the piece itself, Mr.Hubbard uses several general fillers like, kids can color the piece or ""One very obvious way to arrive at an understanding of Picasso's ever-changing creativity is to collect reproductions (or photocopies) of Picasso's work made throughout his lifetime, and arrange them in the order they were created.""The essay does not explore enough about the actual artwork, ""Weeping Woman,"" which is quite fascinating. Perhaps my expectations were wrong, and this might suffice for an elementary classroom teacher who wants to to expose students to modern art. I think it might help to show what grade or audience this is targeted to."
1,really handy camera bag,"For the price this bag is great! Because of the size of todays handycams, digital cameras, cell phones,etc. you'll find they can all fit into this one bag, which makes it easy to carry them all(& carry on airplane) when on vacation."
5,Great bag,I purchased this bag from Amazon because I had a gift certificate. Wal-Mart carries the exact same thing for about three dollars cheaper.
5,"Very Nice Bag, Good Investment","Although this is a camcorder bag, I use it for my camera. It has all the compartments that I need for all my accessories. It's VERY durable, easy to use, and the compartments are are nicely sized. My only complaint is that I wish it was just a little deeper in the compartment that stores the camera."
5,a Very Good Bag,"i recieved this bag free of charge when i bought my sharp minidv camcorder from amazon.com and i must say that if i didnt get it for free i would have bought it myself.. its amazing and my camcorder, cables and tapes fit in easily but BEWARE if your camcorder is not small it prob wont fit or it will fit but you wont be able to put anything else like minidv tapes and stuff.the bag really looks so much better in reality than in online pics.. thank you amazon for this amazing gift"
3,Small....,"I read some reviews before I bought this bag, and I though it would be as the review said ""roomy"". However, the bag barely fits my F717, and I am wondering if my other lenses would fit in this compact bag. Other than the size, the bag is well design and shows superb toughness."
2,Zippers are not good,The side pocket zipper doesn't close!Good size fits DSC HX1 and all his acessories.
5,PERFECT!!,"This bag is awesome! I have room for my camcorder and digital camera in it! It has so many pockets inside and out - I store my rechargeable batteries in it, extra memory cards, cords, instruction manuals, and blank tapes. Its PERFECT!"
5,Outstanding for the price,"I purchased this bag almost a year ago and I am very happy I did. I travel a lot and I carry my cameras (both camcorder and digital camera) everywhere. In my bag I carry all the cables, 5 spare tapes, chargers and spare batteries for my camcorder and the charger with cable and my Colpix digital camera (in it's own case) along with some extras all in this Samsonite Journey Bag. For the less than $19 I paid for it I feel I got a bag worth $50. I have not had one single problem with the bag. It's a great buy.Samsonite Journey Camcorder Bag for Most Camcorders"
5,WHAT A GREAT CAMERA BAG!,"THIS IS THE BEST CAMERA BAG EVER FOR THE MONEY. I CAN'T BELIEVE A SAMSONITE BAG OF THIS SUPER QUALITY WAS UNDER $10! WE HAVE THE PANASONIC PALMCORDER & IT FITS VERY NICELY IN THIS BAG WITH SOME EXTRA 3"" DVD DISCS, THE BATTERY CHARGER AND INSTRUCTION BOOKLET. THIS IS THE BUY OF THE CENTURY!"
1,Do not buy this - big risk,"I bought this for two reasons.1) The previous samsonite bag I bought (""Samsonite Worldproof 3.02 Blue/Black Deluxe SLR, Digital or Compact Camera Bag"") is sturdy and very good.2) Reviews from others with average rating of 4.5I just received it and is a total useless product. I would never expect such a product from Samsonite. Here is what I could find in few minutes:1) Walls of the bag are very thin bend like papers2) The zippers are not good3) The front pocket does not have a zip - what do you expect to put there. Its no good for anything other than big items like battery charger, cables etc.4) The adjustable partitions inside the bag are also not sturdy.Go for ""Samsonite Worldproof 3.02 Blue/Black Deluxe SLR, Digital or Compact Camera Bag"" even if it is $7 to $8 more. Do not risk your camera or camcorder."
4,Good for bigger cameras.,"Positives-Very roomy, lots of fun pockets.Negatives-Too roomy.If you have a small camera, like the Cannon zr45, elura; or the Sony PC9, IP5 type cameras, then go for something smaller.If you have any of the Sony DCR(or ccd)-TRV series, Panasonic PV-DV series, or JVC GRDVL series cameras, then this bag would suit you well. However, it's size makes it inconvenient to lug around during short trips. If you have a smaller camera, I would not recommend this bag. -done, and done!"
4,"Good, But too baggy.",It is great quality but for small camcorder its too small they bounce around and stuff. You need to put a pillow inside to stop that.
4,I really like the old stuff,"I think the 3-4 albums that Journey came out with in this time frame were all very good. If you're a big fan, get them all."
3,"A good album, but not essential.","Nothing special here. This is just a collection of performances from the band's 1980 Departure tour-their last with founding member Gregg Rolie. The last track, ""The Party's Over (Hopelessly In Love)"" is a studio track.You should get Steve Perry's first three albums with Journey first (Infinity, Evolution, and Departure) before even considering this one."
3,Born on the floor,"Although Save Yourself suffers from a lack of ants-in-pants energy forged by the Make Up's past fake-live recordings, it has the same effect as reading an Introduction to the Make Up textbook at 2.65 bpm (that's ""baby's"" per minute, as enigmatic frontman Ian Svenonius utters the phrase 95 times in just under 36 minutes). Stripped down its blueprint and sheer songs, this is a band with a means to its madness and a quirky, peddlable sense that enriches its performance art without inhibiting it. Just as the Rolling Stones guided listeners through sexual tours of neglect, social class and racism, the Make Up's libidous grooves use tracks such as ""The Prophet,"" ""C'mon, Let's Spawn"" and ""I am Pentagon"" to extend fornication's boundaries into religion, childbirth and, yes, even high school arithmetic."
3,Pretty good,"this Cd is pretty good. Not as good as their other Cd's, but very soulful and fun, and intelligent. If you like this album, i suggest you check out maybe Jon Spencer, The Strokes, or The Statue Factor."
1,Who stole the soul?,"The Make-up are lame; if you want soul music then buy a Bobby Charles record. If you want gospel, then buy a Staple Singers record; if you want rock n' roll then buy the Pretty Things or the Monks, or hell even the Minutemen or the Big Boys.But this kind of tripe, man, this junk is for boys and girls who spend too much time in the mirror and read the back of the book instead of finishing the story...totally lame."
1,"nice, but shippings almost as much as the bracelet.","This is a nice bracelet. I would order it, but you have to tack on an extra 7.95 for shipping. not worth it when I can just go to Macy's and buy it for around 15 bucks."
2,Not very good...,"If you are doing ethnographic or ethnological work regarding Yucatan, then this book does contain some information that is helpful and I have not seen spelled out elsewhere, so in that case I would recommend it. However, this ethnography does not really offer an image of life in the Yucatan. His descriptions of life in the pueblo where he was working are lacking. Instead, he spends (too) much of his time complaining about a particular folklorist, one of his ethnographic subjects, and the outside world's perception of ""the Maya."" The latter is an interesting topic but he doesn't really tie it in well with the overall work. He then tries to develop a theory of ethnography which also does not seem to fit into this work."
5,I could'nt put it down!,"Beyond Winter was very impressive. The adventures, trials, tribulations, the twists and turns. It was extremely captivating and surprisingly thrilling. I had to read it twice. I'm ready for Severson's next book..."
5,Love ol Jerry Lee,"Being in my teens in the 50's , I loved Jerry Lee and Elvis but as I have gotten older I like the slower songs and this CD suits me just fine. I have a lot of 8 track of Jerry Lee and then I bought cassettes and now I'm buying his CD's. I was fortunate enought to see him in person twice and he was great both times.He's a talent and a showman."
2,Tedious!,Maxwell's writing is enjoyable but the restraint of his characters makes the story very slow-moving and boring. Reading this book was a chore
2,Failed Production,"Although the performance itself is competent, if you care about recording quality then do not buy this CD! The most dramatic moments of the Symphony are dulled by poor acoustics and probably poor recording engineers. In addition, upper ranges in some of the violin solos of the Violin Concerto sound scratchy and downright irritable to the ears on good stereo equipment. There are plenty of decent Sibelius recordings out there, but this is most emphatically not one of them."
5,"Logos, the Lost Word and other Mysteries Examined.",Mysteries are called mysteries for a reason. Waite will take you as far as you are able to go in this deeply profound book on the hermetic life. Simply amazing.
3,Not as engrossing as other books in the series,"Judge Dee and his staff investigate the background of a seemingly simple fight between bullies that left one of them dead.It didn't catch my interest immediately; the characters seemed rather one-dimensional. The story eventually did hold my attention but the characters never managed to feel real, as they did in other books in the series. Nor did I find the whodunit believable, with appropriate hints delivered along the way. I wonder whether this might have been an early work that Van Gulik dragged out for publication after the series had been running a while, because the best rating I can give it is ""okay."""
4,Multiple Murders - And A Bear,"A storm forces Judge Dee to stay overnight in a Taoist temple. There he finds he must investigate the poisoning of one religious young woman, the disappearance of two other women, a possible ghost, a possibly murdered abbot, and numerous suspicious living men and women. All his questions are answered, but administering justice strains his moral code."
2,these are NOT her best!,"Number One: why would this most AWESOME and HEARTFELT songwriter open this ""Best of..."" CD with a cover song (Love Is The Answer)! Come on, Cindy - I know you can do better. Cindy has become my favorite Christian female artist. I love her style, I love her heart that she puts into each and every song. And she writes truth with amazing depthness and sincerity. I, too, was disapppointed in this ""Best of...."" by Cindy. Under The Waterfall, Listen, and The Loving Kind are clearly and hands down her best projects. I'm not giving up on you, Cindy!"
1,Essentially I have read all of this elsewhere,"This is about the best book on the subject I have read with one exception. I would have given FIVE stars except for something about the title and content;I have read most all of it before VERBATIM. This book seems to have a different cover photo,a softcover vs.hardcover,different publication date,authored by ""editors"" vs. a specific person,and two seemingly separate publishers than The Australian Shepherd:How To Keep A HAppy Healthy Pet. This is the ""revised"" edition. It would have been nice to know that this more current{by two years!} edition was ESSENTIALLY the same book I already purchased! Why change the cover? Anyway,caveat emptor. I recommend the public library or the internet as additional sources of information contained in this book{s}. Got me this time."
2,just about dogs,Nothing really special about australian shepherds in here. A lot of general information about dogs.
5,so masculin makes you wanna spit like a man :P,"I've been listening to Mellencamp's music since i was a child (my brother likes him) i still don't think of his general music as catchy. But this is amazing, it's absolute perfection... John did really good on this album, & i like the way he sings on the ""get-tough"" songs & on the romantic ones, the album's very different than his usuall stuff (beats & bass lines). shame that it's underrated by the public & hardly anyone knows about this album (it's his best ever)now, after listening to ""Mr. happy goes lucky"" for nearly 3 years i finally found similiar music to his. Train (meet virginia, I am..etc...) is the other version for this great music, both are alike in being very masculin :P (i should drop that i know)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone who appreciates good rock."
3,"not bad, not good","I love Mellencamp and band's music. Always have, always will. This CD however, was disappointing. Some have praised it, and I am happy about that. I would hate for Mellencamp ever to put out a generally hated CD. There are some great songs here, but about half of them I could skip through. The bright spots are Key west, Just another day, and life is hard. Maybe I am too old school to enjoy this album. But as I said, I am glad most of you do."
4,John Mellencamp CD,I get the CD on one of the days I should have get the CD the CD Play fine it is a very good CD if you like John Mellencamp music you should buy this CD
2,Not his best-by far.,"My advice is to lokk for the hits off of this album on a compilation sometime in the future. THe hits are really the best cuts. Sadly, it seems as if the album was just pumped out with no thougt. I was very dissapointed with this album."
2,if your looking for good taste this in it,i have many of her products this on just made me sick when using it. and i wasn't like straight up eating it. its just not the best. but the delicious kissable now that i give 5 stars! and so does my BF!
5,Great experience from start to finish.,"This is the nicest and thinest TV I have ever seen, and now owned. The colors are awsome, and everything is very familiar if you have owned a TV in the past, except for how thin this unit is. We bought this to give ourselves more room, and didn't actually realize how much room until the old 32"" Tube TV was gone. We got to get rid of the TV stand, and the huge TV and now have a nice small unit that we can hang on the wall. Philips makes awsome product, and we have had a grat experience from Amzon throughout the entire process."
1,Great panel. Screwed up inputs,"The box says dual component HD inputs. The set has only one set of component inputs. The DVI-D port does not support HDCP so it will not work with any new DVD player and set top boxes with DVI output since most have HDCP protection on them.I bought this from a local store (Fry's), returned it. Philips' tech support is clueless about their own technology. The wonders of outsourcing!I would not buy this TV since it is not ""future proof"". No DVI-HDCP and no HDMI. DVI input works for PC only. WTF would someone buy an expensice plasma for a computer."
1,Do not buy,"Sound goes out, customer service and tech support from Philips Magnavox is horrible, they told me my TV didn't have speakers, then they said it was the Sound Processing board, then the went back to the TV didn't have speakers, Now they admit the TV does have speakers but the board will take a couple months to order, ship and install. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN"
3,C+ movie at best,Not the best Bruce Willis film but a solid movie to say the least although I wish Mos Def's character didn't have to talk so much. All in All I would say its a rental at best.
3,A tad unrealistic,"Ok so the plot here is that a bunch of dirty cops are trying to kill Mos Def before he can testify against them at a grand jury? And tired alky Bruce Willis,a dirty cop himself, suddenly decides to go straight and get the ex-con to the courtroom some 16 hairy NYC blocks away. The problem is all this shooting and chasing could not happen in Manhattan without someone calling the media. And all Bruce had to do, if he was serious, was call the media himself and he'd have been protected enough to walk Mos Def into court. Even when a bus gets hijacked, there are no TV helicopters around. Haha. Not likely. Still, Mos Def displays some acting chops here, even if it is as a stereotypical criminal. A good watch if you can suspend disbelief for 90 mins."
5,People Can and Do Change....,"One of the best films I've seen in awhile. Both Bruce Willis and Mos Def play their roles in an ecellent fashion.Although this isn't anything new for Willis, he still manages to bring something ""extra"" to his character. While Mos Def plays his part...exceptionally. Yes! His characters voice is annoying, but that is part of his charm and appeal. He has that simple quallity about him that is believable (and likeable)! I mean come on...we all know someone in our personal lives that simply does not know when to shut up and tend to talk about the most irrelevant and strangest things possible.In contrast to a comment made in the review posed by someone else, I have added this movie to my DVD collection and I will watch it again.I would recommend it to others."
3,Run of the Mill,Starring Bruce willis and Mos Def. This crime thriller stars Willis as a veteran cop who is pass his sell-by date and just waiting for retirement.He is set the task of excorting Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) to court where he will testify against some corrupt cops. Thing is he's sent on this errand simply because he's expendible and the death of this Principle witness will rest nicely on his dead and basically ruin his already faltering career.Cops are out to find Eddie and kill him..and Jack (Willis) decides to do somthing worthy for a change and save this man's life;what he doesn't realise is that by doing so he must now save both their lives.Starring Willis and Mos def this film is watchable if you can get over Willis' ever present dead beat look and the retarded and subnormal Eddie bunker who talks and talks nothing of substance.
5,They changed,"Bruce Willis and Mos Def make a perfect pair of misfits--Willis--hopeless and with a perpetual hangover and Def--hopeful, but can never shut his trap. Additionally, there is also a mind game playing in this movie, kind of like Conspiracy Theory or The Game, where you're not sure if you are on track with what's going on or whether you, like the main characters, are temporarily fooled. I was amazed that, what could be a boring two hours, was quite entertaining, not only for the mind action, but also for Def's lively conversation, which early on seemed senseless but ended up being very meaningful. In the end, I loved both characters, and that's what kept me on the edge of my seat. As soon as the movie was over, I wanted to go right back into the theater to watch it again and find out what I'd missed in the first viewing."
4,More Mos Def Magic and Bruce Willis Die Hard,"This is a cool action flick. What else would you expect from (Mr. Shoot em up and beat me up) Bruce Willis? The movie smacks of The Last Boy Scout with a new flavor. Rather than go through the plot, suffice it to say, that with the addition of Mos Def, this is a quality action movie. Mos Def brings his magic persona (remember ""Something the Lord Made""?) to this tale of a corrupt cop finally seeing the light. The ending is bittersweet and reflective of the magic that Mos Def always seems to exude in his roles. Yes, I did buy this DVD."
4,16 Blocks,"This movie was and stil is my second favorite movie of all time. Detective Jack Mosely( Bruce willis), must reluctuntaly transfer a ""CI"" to the court house to testify and he wasnt too happy about the detail because he just wanted to go home and drink some more. Dectective Mosely was a very distraught and unhappy Detective who had been ""awakened up"" by shots firing at his ""CI"" and at himself. He was determined to find out who and why is taking shots at the both of them and why they do not want his CI to live to testify. Dectective Mosely became instantly sober and returned back to his keen awareness and tactics to keep both of them alive and on the right path to the courthouse.Once Detective Mosely found out who and why they wanted the CI dead; he had a decision to make and whether or not it was time to correct his wrongs he had commmited himself to put him in an alcoholic slumber.... Detective Mosely is one Detective to have on one's side through thick and thin......"
3,around the block with 16 blocks,"I thought 16 Blocks was an ok movie. It was good to watch BW as the drunken, unfit copper who decides to take a stand against former corrupt coppers. I also like the fact you got the alternative ending to watch as well. In all, a Good Flick"
4,Full of surprises.,I was pessimistic re what seemed to be another Bruce Willis shootemup movie but came away surprised and very entertained. Mos Def is a treasure.
3,Not too Shabby,"I would wait to see this one on DVD, but it wasn't a complete waste of time and money. Pretty good acting from Bruce Willis and Mos Def (it did take me awhile to get use to his weird voice) and the pacing kept the movie moving along. Some things were unbelievable, like how everything in this movie took place in under 2 hours. 16 Blocks was what I expected, a decent way to kill some time, but nothing worth writing home about."
2,"Basically, a redux of ""The Gauntlet""","Except Eastwood's take was waaaaaay better.However, I watched this in the hotel room while on a business trip, so as a time-killer it was okay.A few good moments. Willis wasn't as smirky as usual... that was good.Mos Def was irritatingly whiny; this guy's a rap star?!?Eh; two-and-a-half stars. It could have been worse, I guess. Or I could have had appendicitis on my trip."
4,Good Bruce Willis Film,16 blocks is a well rounded Bruce Willis movie and even family oriented. I thought the plot and storyline were both well written with some suspense and action. Should keep your attention well from the beginning to the end. It has a pretty good ending as well that is appropriate and even a little emotional. A must see for all Willis fans.Peter J. Miller
5,great movie,"This is a great movie to watch. If you like happy endings, don't watch the alternate ending, it sucks....(just didn't like how it ended) I like happy endings"
2,Below average movie,"There is no suspense, no excitement in this movie.Bruce Willis's acting is Okay. I have seen this kind of plot many times.The action scenes are not exciting as they should be."
4,Good movie,"The movie was good. Bruce Willis turns in another impressive performance. I like to see things where people do the right thing. Should watch the alternate ending, this is the one that I expected to see when I saw the movie the first time."
2,"Annoying ""remake"" of the GAUNTLET",Bruce Willis unfortunatley wastes his talents on 16 BLOCKS.Basically this movie is a rehash of Clint Eastwood's far superior THE GAUNTLET.Most annoying in this film is Def's character who speaks with such an exaggerated NASAL tone to his voice that you wish he would get shot just so you can stop listening to him and have the film end quicker.
3,typical Willis flick,"Is it just me or does Bruce Willis always play an aging, washed up cop with drinking/smoking habits? Well at least he is convincing in such a role. This movie is a lot like his Diehard series, but this time he has an annoying sidekick. Also, the movie is about 15 minutes too long. The picture quality is only OK for HD DVD. Please studios stop making hybrid discs and cramming the HD movie onto only 15 GB. Not only does the picture quality suffer, but they also charge more than they do for the HD DVD only release! If I have the HD version, why would I want the SD version? Likewise, if I want the SD version, I probably won't want the HD version."
3,Why Droopy?,"Fairly predictable cop story, in fact there wasn't a single thing that couldn't be seen coming' a mile away. It was a shame to waste a fine performance by Willis as the worn-out police detective assigned to take witness (Mos Def doing an inexplicable imitation of Droopy) to the court house. On the way he finds out there's a number of fellow officers who would perfer that Droopy not make it to his grand jury date.The action is okay but nothing out of the ordinary and nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before. It's shot well and has good production values but well beneath the standard of the vehicles we're use to when starring Willis. I was hoping for something at least as good as Hart's War but this is not. Just a time killer, airliner stuff."
1,If this movie seems familiar ...,"This ""project"" answers the nagging question: ""What would happen if we crossed '48 Hours' with 'The Gauntlet'? And how about if we make Mos Def channel Stepin Fetchit, while we're at it? In what is arguably the most stereotyped minority accent since Mikey Rooney channeled WWII-era anti-Tojo propaganda cartoons in ""Breakfast At Tiffany"", Mos Def creates a barely-two-dimensional character which is still a dimension more than Willis' world-weary-cop-living-in-a-bottle. David Morse is wasted, acting like he stepped in from another screenplay. In short -- a waste of money, be it as a purchase or a rental."
1,My two cents.,"Is it just me or were you thinking about Damon Wayons Homeless Guy from the T.V. show In Living Color, every time Mos Def opened his mouth. Man was that ANNOYING, or what. Shallow people who like cop movies will dig this one. This is way to played out for me....a crooked cop out to whack a guy before he testifies. How cliche."
3,"Formulaic, witless, lethargic","This is not the Bruce Willis of Die Hard. Sad that Willis is now forced to take roles playing broken down and out of shape aging men. This movie is so entirely predictable that it isn't worth even been curious about. The only gems of the film are 1. the usual genious of David Morse and 2. the charisma of Mos Def. Other than that, this movie plays like a long scene from a late night cop show."
3,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"16 BLOCKS OF KINDA BEING BORED,, LIKE BRUCE WILLIS ROLE HATED EVERYTHING ELSE I WATCHED THIS ONE TIME THATS IT I BOUGHT THIS FIRST DAY OUT ON DVD AND WASTED MY MONEY REDBOX THIS ONE BETTER YET BORROW IT FROM A FREIND....AND MOS DEF DID GOOD ACTING JUST NOT THIS ROLE IT WAS STUPID AND SUCKED!!!"
2,as bad as a movie gets,"it couldn't ne so awful... yet it was good!!!i'm confused about whether i liked it or not!!but i'm already sick this movies!!!there are no twists! there's no suspense, no chills, nothing at all!!got busted!!"
4,Entertaining and pretty realistic,"If you're looking for Bruce Willis in the role of the Tough Action Hero he often portrayed, you might be somewhat disappointed. That said, 16 Blocks is a very interesting, realistic film. The characters are as real as can be, the story is gripping. There are a few moments where you may wonder ""why doesn't he ... instead"" but that's easy to forgive. Overall I was glued to the screen troughout, and I was left with a good feeling about it. Worth buying!"
3,Decent but a little tired,"This movie seemed to reek of the good cop bad cop scenarios we have seen so many times before. I guess I have seen this so many times since Serpico that it is wearing on me. The acting is well done by Bruce Willis and Mos Def. Mos Def especially impressed me with his reformed criminal that wants to be a baker. Bruce does his usual good job portraying a alcholic tired old cop that is just sick of it all and perhaps looking forward to the end. He still has a few tricks up his sleeve though when his back is up against the wall. The rest the roles just didn't show anything special. Decent action, decent story, decent music. All-in-all a decent movie but certainly not the caliber of the Dirty Harrys, the Die Hards, or the Lethal Weapons. Good for a rental, but I wouldn't suggest you buy it."
2,Fun with Voices,"Mos Def ( I think his name is ) had the most annoying voice throughout the whole movie. I wish he would shut up about his stupid cake shop already. If people were trying to kill me I wouldn't keep blabbing about the most senseless things on and on and on. People are coming to kill me, why don't I talk really loud so they can find me. Was he mentally challenged or what? I was able to watch the whole movie as the two main characters were fun to make fun of ;) Enjoy talking like Eddie (Mos Def) for hours after you've seen it to amuse your friends."
4,surprisingly well done,"I thought this movie was going to be alot like many other movies of its kind - a police chase action movie. I love Mos Defs character and I love how great his acting was for it, they complimented each other. Bruce Willis does an awesome job, as does the rest of the cop cast.But I especially liked the directing, and how what seems to be an oridinary movie keeps you entertained and captivated in a way like its a new concept. But, it isn't a new concept, and therefore still not anything too special, but definately one of the best in its genre, and deep in a subtle way."
4,"""There are no lines!""","16 Blocks brings to the screen the story of a down-on-his-luck NYPD detective charged with escorting a witness 16 blocks away to testify in court. All, however, is not what it seems in NYC and there might be just a little more to what looks like a routine transport...Bruce Willis, Mos Def, David Morse, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows. Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few tears.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In conclusion, 16 Blocks is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection especially if you are a Bruce Willis fan."
5,A more open book now,"Anna Wierzbicka is the first person who has managed to make me see what Jesus really meant. Unlike most Bible commentators, Wierzbicka does not paraphrase what Jesus said. That is, she does not just replace Jesus' images by other new images, but in plain and simple words she makes explicit the meanings of those images, the presuppositions contained in what Jesus said, the implied negations and refutations, the implicatures, in one word: the deeper intentions of God's acting in and through Jesus. Her greatest merit is that she does not lead us, readers and believers, away from Jesus' words, but again and again takes us back to them with the fuller understanding enabled by her explications. Both for lay people and theologians her universal language, which is based on years of detailed research in many different languages and cultures, is the key to open the meaning of it all"
5,a linguist examines the meaning of jesus' words,"Although this book is also concerned with linguistics, the meditation on Jesus' words is done with such evident spiritual care that the lay person looking for devotional reading will be amply rewarded. I read a lot of work on biblical criticism, and Wierzbicka is terrific on Jesus and women and on the originality of his admonition to turn the other cheek. Wierzbicka canvasses many of the arguments of biblical critics on all points and offers her own, reasoned assessment on the authenticity and meaning of the words."
5,Running with Scissors,HOW did this film get pass me???? I saw it on cable TV and had to have it.All the actors are wonderful...All should have gotten awards for there afforts in this film.Jill Clayburg at her best. And i would go on and say her best film ever ! It just one good film. You will laugh and cry at the same time... A+ all around...I have the sound track ordered. I love the music also......another A+
5,Great Movie!,"I love the adaptation of Augusten Burroughs book, and the cast was superb. Annette Benning is awesome, and so is Gwyneth Paltrow ."
4,"not by the book, but captures the spirit of the book","An exceptionally well-done adaptation of the book. Unlike a typical film, where the screenwriter thinks he or she knows better than the original bestselling author, Ryan Murphy (who also directed and produced this film) trusts the original material enough to adapt the majority of it. The casting for this movie is superb too - from the surprising appearance of Joseph Fiennes as the mentally deranged 35-year-old Bookman, who has an affair with the protagonist, to Annette Bening cast as the protagonist's mother, a woman who comes further apart at the seams with each scene we see her in to Rachel Evan Wood and Gwyneth Paltrow as the perfect fit sisters and daughters of the psychiatrist who adopts the main character."
1,Gag me!,"I checked out this unpleasant little film from the library. You can thank me for that, since now you don't have to watch it. Based on the popular Augusten Burroughs memoir and marketed as a comedy, ""Running with Scissors"" is a rambling, grueling portrait of an unlikeable, dysfunctional band of narcissistic crazies who relentlessly and cruelly abuse themselves and each other. It's a catalog of over-the-top stereotypes about mental illness, a waste of good acting talent, a thoroughly exhausting experience, and two hours of my time down the dumper. The original memoir, which I haven't read, may be a good book, but if so, it's been utterly butchered in the process of adaptation. I can't even imagine sitting through this mess again, much less paying for the DVD!"
5,Freaking Hilarious!!!,"This movie was the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. I was somewhat shocked by the poop, homosexual sex and the rest but the thing is I know people are all different in their own ways in real life. People do crazy, unspeakable things, they just dont usually tell anyone about it or make a movie about it for all to see. That is what I love about the movie. In my opinion it is entirely unpredictable and original and AMAZINGLY HILARIOUS. I didn't read the book but I went to the theater with a bunch of people who did. They said they skipped some parts in the movie and that I should read the book to get the full effect. Nevertheless, I loved IT!"
2,Good Actors Trapped by an Awful Script,"Nicely acted, nicely photographed. The script, however, is confusing, pretentious and self-indulgent. The screenwriting is just awful. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up."
3,Read the book,"I just finished watching this movie, and I'm a little bit confused about it. In some ways it is inspirational, how that someone who went through so much can actually still come out alive and even in some ways for the better. On the other hand, after reading the book as well, I'd have to say that this ""watered down"" version leaves the viewer cold; read the book. I admire the bravery of Augusten for exposing all of his dirty laundry for us all to see, and I suspect that a lot of us can relate to it. Maybe we didn't all have a psycho mom, an alcoholic dad, or a lover 20 years older than we were, but we all have our ""things"", don't we? Here they are exaggerated for us, and ours look smaller for it. Thanks Augusten. If you made it then I'm sure anyone can."
1,Running with Scissors DVD,Definitely a waste of time. I expected more from top actors and actresses but they had no substance to work from. I expected a comedy. NOT. Very dark and depressing. The book was worse; don't waste your time on either.
2,Embarassed to finish watching this,"This movie has a great number of laughable moments, but underlying the story is a great antipathy to humanity and decency. Burroughs has sold out to the cheap, scatological laugh, and we are all diminished by it.The story, ""a memoir"" is so patently false that it is no wonder that the family portrayed has sued the author, publisher, and Sony, and has collected.I will not read (or watch) anything from Burroughs again. I am surprised that the artists stooped to this."
2,Running With Safety Scissors...,"To any of you interested in this film, I highly recommend reading the book instead. It seems that the movie just couldn't cover any of the erotic detail that add to the book's highly intriguing, eccentricity. I was very disappointed after watching the film, although Joseph Cross did play Augusten well. And Annette Benning did play the mother... They just played this one way too safe in comparison to the book. It sucks that greatness can be so censored."
1,Pointlessly Depressing,"Some of my favorite movies include: Requiem for a Dream, American Beauty, Royal Tenenbaums, Schindler's List, and American Psycho. That being said... I thought that this movie was nothing more than a catalog of mental disorders causing a handful of people to make each other's lives miserable. This movie was profoundly depressing with absolutely no point. I have never turned a movie off before finishing it and I actually had to fight that urge throughout most of this film."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"By far one of the worst movies I have ever watched, and I have viewed some losers. After 45 minutes of ""pain"" waiting for it to improve, I stopped the DVD and put it in the trash."
2,Disappointed,"Extremely good cast and acting, but of course not as good as the book. Definitely not a comedy as some have described, and is a slow goer."
5,This Movie touched me,I can relate to this movie.Joseph Cross brought Augusten to life for me. WOW WOW WOW... i had to run out and buy the book Dry that takes off where the movie leaves off. i had to see what happend next. I hope now that i have read Dry to see it on the silver screen soon also. Our lives are so similar. I wish i could get Augusten Burroughs to write my life sotry. He is fantastic!!! WOW Buy it see it Love IT...
1,Ignore The One Star,"I expected something, anything, from such a strong cast, but this movie failed on all counts. The group of us here made it through about an hour of unadulterated boredom before we ran out of Fritos, reasons to use the bathroom, and small talk.I won't even bother to go into detail. This movie belongs in the recycling bin (where my husband just threw it).Don't bother!"
4,A bizarre movie pretty close to the book,"My wive bought the book this movie was based on for me for my birthday and once I had read it I had to see the movie. While pretty much no movie is just like the book, I thought this came fairly close. One thing that comes to mind is that the movie characters were a lot more attractive that what was described in the book, but hey, not a big surprise. This movie is definately not for everyone, considering the subject matter, but one that will keep you wondering what could possibly happen next. Also, it did not end like the book, but you can find that out for yourself. I gave it four stars because it's supposed to be based on a real person's life and not because of the story. It will likely be a long while before I watch it again."
2,Be prepared for a warped movie,"The back of the DVD case called the movie a ""wickedly funny"" tale. Not true at all. It is one of those very warped movies, true or not, that makes you feel sick to your stomach. I tend to like the more unusual, moving films, but this is over the line. Reminds me of the Squid and the Whale. I feel very sorry for the author if this truly is based on his life."
2,"Great cast, but missing the dark humor of the book","I had high expectations for this movie - I had read the book and knew that the cast had great potential. The actors were great in portraying their roles - from Annette Bening as the eccentric mother to Gwenyth Paltrow as the obedient daughter, but the plot of the movie missed the biting dark humor that had put the novel in the top 10 of my collection. I'm afraid that, if I had seen the movie before reading the book, I might not have read the book."
5,"""Do not run with scissors""",This movie is absolutely hilarious! I hadn't seen it for a long time and was so glad I decided to buy it. I'm going to show it to some friends who are dying to see it. It is worth every penny!
2,Good actors in search of a purpose,"Make no mistake: Annette Bening does a fantastic job here as the mentally unbalanced, frustrated poet, and mother of the real life protagonist, Augusten Burroughs. Alec Baldwin does a nice turn as the alky father, while Paltrow, Wood, Cox, et. al. portray the messy and crazy Finch family which adopts Augusten for a while. Joseph Fiennes is also great in his role as Augusten's sometime lover.Sure, it's a great cast, but the year that it covers seems to drag on and on, with pervasive musical interludes, an unbelievable portrait of the Finches and their ""house,"" and it is a chore to get through this film. There seems to be no point or purpose, there is very little humor, and it is quite unsatisfying as a memoir.Too bad these actors are wasted."
1,Really wanted to like this one. . . .,"We bought this DVD because of the promises on the case, which made it sound like a hilarious comedy with a wonderful cast. Unfortunately, neither my wife nor I were able to find anything funny about it. This is a movie about characters who use and manipulate each other, hurting each other greatly in the process. The script is simply awful, giving us no reason to care for or about any of the characters at all. While the actors seemed to be able to convey their characters' quirks and personalities quite well, almost nothing works together, and the film just gets more and more depressing as it goes. This is definitely one to pass on if you have anything else to choose from at all. There was no feeling of ""I've just watched something important,"" not even ""I've just been entertained well."" It's simply a dark and dreary story of dreary characters who arouse no sympathy on the part of the viewer. These were two wasted hours."
2,"Not a comedy, just strange","If you want to watch a depressing movie about a crazy family then this is the movie for you. Yes, anyone who can survive this is truly remarkable but was marketed wrong as a comedy. I found nothing funny about it. The acting was good, but not what I expected."
1,Waste of time and money,I should have looked at the reviews before I subjected myself to what I thought would be a good movie. I watched the entire movie then removed it from the DVD player opened the back door and threw it across the yard. It will remain there until trash day and then it will reside in a land fill with all the other garbage.
1,So bad it's unwatchable; do yourself a favor and pass on this one.,"This is a terrible waste of a talented cast. I rented it thinking how can you go wrong with Annette Bening, Evan Rachel Wood, Alec Baldwin, Joseph Fiennes, Jill Clayburgh, Gwyneth Paltrow? Well, this flick is how. It's awful.The film is disjointed, no plot or character development. The jokes are heavy-handed, un-funny, and repeated and milked ad nauseum. This review is for the first 1/2 hour of the film. That is all I could sit through.Have this DVD in your medicine cabinet in case you ever need an emetic. That's the only use I can think of for it."
2,Running With Scissors,"Polarizing performance by Annette Benning. Great cast that followed the story-line as true to the acclaimed novel as possible. An abstract story, entertaining in nature but drags its feet."
3,Not worth your time,"There were small elements of the story that I appreciated, but not enough of them to make it worthwhile to watch the whole movie- and usually I really love artistic independent-type films. It drags on and on in really odd directions with no real punchline. Weird."
3,Running with Scissors - The Movie,"I was somewhat disappointed in this movie. I felt the book was far more intense and gave you a deeper understanding of Augusten's life. Although there was an excellent cast in the movie, it just didn't match the intensity and craziness that was in the book. Had I not read the book first, I may have appreciated the movie more. I give the movie a B-."
2,"Great book, disappointing movie","I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Running With Scissors"" and was thrilled to learn that they were going to make a movie of it. Sadly, the movie was a big disappointment. Yes it follows the plot-lines of the book, but Augusten Burroughs's wry, entertaining voice is completely lost in the translation. The movie plods along, and although Annette Benning is terrific, and Evan Rachel Wood good also, they can't save this one. The worst thing about it is actually the soundtrack-- not the music itself, which is a grab-bag of unremarkable 1970s songs-- but it's loud, intrusive, and badly placed. Again and again the characters are talking OVER a song and you can't even hear them.Save your money. Buy Augusten Burroughs's next book instead."
3,Tried too hard.,"The start of the film was quite hearty, further on as characters are introduced little room for improvisation is left cause they're actually very extreme characters in their own right. 50 minutes into the film, it starts to get boring. While this film is not an indie and doesn't really celebrate itself completely, I felt there were a few outrageously beautiful scenes. The best scene involves a guy and a girl breaking bits of the ceiling off. That and a few other scenes makes one smile. However, towards the end, you felt the direction is rather didactic, ya know kind of ""Please buy this"" salesman like. Complicated, I know. Basically, this film tries to make a statement which the book already made (I Presume) It failed in that right. Annette Bening looks haggard towards the end and it's not a very pretty sight. RUNNING WITH SCISSORS tried to be as nonchalant as SQUID AND THE WHALE but something was lacking. Something beyond a storyline. Blame the director, then. :)"
1,What A Mess!,"Like others, I decided to see ""Running With Scissors"" based on a trailer I saw that presented it as a dark, eccentric comedy. The cast looked more than promising, and I love quirky movies, but I shut this one off after watching an hour of venom-filled yelling and swearing. It's very unusual for me to not watch a film in its entirety, but I felt I was completely wasting my time and turned it off. I didn't like any of the characters, although I felt some degree of sympathy for the boy (not enough to see how he fared, however). This was the most disappointing film I've seen in a very long time."
2,A big disappointment and waste of a good cast.,"I read the book, and for some reason had very high expectations. The book was quirky, sad, eccentric, horrific, and redeeming all at once. But the movie was just horrific from the very start. The character depth was nonesxistent, the plot was dismal, and the script was, for a lack of a better word, atrocious. Even though the adaptation tried to remain faithful to the book, all the scenes seemed to be lacking the spark and charisma that Burroughs had in his writing. I pictured the characters differently, and seeing them on screen as three dimensional figures, I realized they were better off on paper. The book is definitely worth the read, but the movie should be forgotten quickly. When will authors learn?"
4,Fantastically Bizarre Film with Extraordinary Performances by Bening and Woods,"This film is along the lines of ""The Squid and the Whale"","" ""The Royal Tennenbuams"" ""Magnolia"" and ""American Beauty."" It was fantastically bizarre, yet mind boggling to find out it was based on a true story!Annette Bening gives a multifacited, deeply layered performance as Deirdre Burroughs, a tortured and unpublished poet. Bening was snubbed for an Oscar Nomination. Evan Rachel Wood has grown strong in her craft as the scene stealing, hellmaker Natalie Finch. An unrecognizable Ralph Feinnes and a severley disturbed Gweneth Paltrow both have some wonderful moments too.Some of the things that our hero, Augusten Burroughs (ably played by Joseph Cross) goes through in this movie may seem over the top and unlikely, but it's based on a true story, which makes the journey even more rewarding at the end.Give this quirky film a chance. It's hard to categorize as a Comedy or Drama, more like a Dark Dramedy. Enjoy!"
1,Miserable,Ridiculous and atrocious. Does a disservice to a mediocre book. And all backed by a soundtrack that's unnecessary and completely out of place. Avoid.
1,"Weird, to say the least!","I just couldn't get into it, no matter how hard I tried. It had some funny stuff going on but things just didn't come together. Haphazard! Nothing gelled. Too much senseless nonsense."
2,Sorry,"While this review won't be very detailed, I think the point will be quite clear:read the book, skip the movie."
2,"loved the book, movie didn't come close to living up to the book","like i said in the title the book was awesome. i loved the dark humor and if you have read the book...I absolutely loved augustens personality in the book. his ideas of doctors and how they should be...the way he describes himself and his love for shiny things...just his whole personality as a child in general was HILARIOUS but I didnt see much of any of that in the movie. also, I HATE how hollywood adds so many scenes that were NOT in the book...that book had more than enough crazy messed up GOOD scenes in it that it by no means needed more that didnt even exist for the movie. overall, i would recommend watching the movie if you HAVE read the book because its cool to see a book come to life on the big screen."
2,give me a valium,"no wait, this movie is a demo of what it feels like to take a valium. Jill Clayburgh is the one bright spot in this snoozer."
3,Running With Scissors,"This movie was very different from what I would usually watch, but I did enjoy it quite a lot. It was recommended to me by a friend as otherwise I doubt that I would have ever ordered it. I have watched it a couple of times now and I do recommend it to anyone with an open mind as it is a bit strange but has a great cast of actors. I especially enjoyed the ending as I feel it has a happy one which I always like."
2,Agony vs Curiosity,"I have read Augusten's book which was witty despite it being somewhat 'shocking' the bunch of dysfunctional weirdo's in the mix.I watched the movie in agony. Excrutiating. All the humour was missing, although if they wanted to portray all the agony and discord, they did get it right x 100%There was one laugh out loud bit, rather amusing, the poetry reading by Neel.....The cover I saw had on it 'hilarious, amusing' It is anything but. Not for the light hearted."
4,Wonderful :),"As far as I can tell, there really aren't any scratches on the CD or things to be concerned about.The movie came in it's original casing and I'm exciting to finally own it."
1,If you read the book..,"Don't watch the movie!! The movie puts the book to shame! As funny and entertaining as the book was, the movie is the exact opposite!! Terrible adaptation!"
2,Couldn't Relate,"I can certainly understand some of the issues driving the story, but I can't relate to this film. I feel nothing for any of the characters. Visually and performance-wise, it's terrific. Storywise, I guess I prefer more sober approaches to telling a story. I understand that this script is based on fact, however, if that's the case, they are people toward whom I shrug with a ""so what?"" I can appreciate off-the-wall humor; I loved ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" for instance but ""Running With Scissors"" doesn't work. Sometimes it's just that strange x-factor which, for me, is in play here. I can't recommend this film at all."
4,Fine,I was pleased to get the book. It arrived in a timely manner and in the condition described. My mother had a copy years ago. Since we were (and still are) a family of readers I now recall trying to read it during my early teens. It's a bit slow but is a somewhat interesting autobiography of a handicapped girl.
5,Timeless,"This book has been sitting around on my shelf since I was a child. I thought it was a child's book when I was young, but couldn't read it. I just pulled it off the shelf again, and have discovered what will become one of my favorite books about hope, determination, the power of positive thinking, and art - its struggles, its blisses, its importance. It is a must read for any writer, or for that matter, any artist who struggles with stealing time to do their art without feeling somehow guilty, or fearful, or terribly isolated. It is about transcendance despite ridiculous odds. It is an amazing, amazing book. I'm so glad I got around to it."
3,Greek language CD,"I am only half way through the cds so far, but I have yet to encounter some very important phrases such as, ""Where is the bathroom?"""
3,Useful but Elementary,"The Pimsleur method is most useful for those who have trouble studying a foreign language. After a while the repetitions become maddening and, worse, boring. At the end, one has a command of some useful sentence patterns but a very small vocabulary. You will, also, not be able to read a street sign or menu written in Greek characters. The amount of material might ordinarily be mastered in a few days before moving on to more serious grammar. I viewed this purchase as a preliminary to buying the entire course, but I have now decided against it. Combined with an elementary grammar book and supplemented with Just Listen 'N Learn Greek, Pimsleur Instant Conversation would probably be useful, but I cannot imagine even asking directions or ordering a meal after completing this course."
4,Opa!,"I had basic Greek down about 10 years ago & what you don't use.... These disks are good for basic ""how are you"" type conversation. They are very repetitious which can be nerve racking the first lesson is hi; I understand Greek/English; I don't understand Greek/English; miss/sir...the second lessons is the same along w/ the third which also changes what you just learned into masculine/feminine. They also have different pronunciations that what I already new which is just a dialect issue. I gave them to my friend and she seemed to like them as well for a refresher. Would I learn if I didn't know any Greek? Definitely"
5,Loooved it,I lost my CD of Lady J and just bought a new one - forgot how much I looove this woman's voice -- got me out of my bad mood.
3,Out of Print on CD - an avant jazz classic from 1957,"Out of print on CD & vinyl these days, The Sounds of Yusef recorded for Prestige and released in Oct 1957 shows Lateef's blossoming interest in exploring the sounds of the East. This is a predecessor to his classic 1961 ""Eastern Sounds"" disc. My fave track is the adventurous and experimental ""Love and Humor"" with it's Chinese gong, Asian style flute lines played by Lateef and a passage of apparently non-traditional instruments like 7-Up bottles and the taught surfaces of balloons stroked til they create that high pitched squeaking kids seem to love way more than adults. Anyhow, it's not all like that, and any traditional jazz fans could still enjoy the melodious opener ""Take the 'A' Train""."
4,Well worth buying,"I might not be utterly blown away by this book but it is growing on me. The material inside is not about impact but slow release. The book is relatively small and intimate...just like the images inside. All plates are beautifully presented and the finish of the book overall is first rate. I was not familiar with his work when I bought this and plugged for it 'blind' based on recommendations. I dont regret it for one minute as I know it is a book that encourages a quiet, relaxed contemplative browse. The work inside is fantastic and stays with you once you close the cover. If you are a photographer normally drawn to more 'up front' work, this book will stimulate different parts! Well worth buying. Quite small but not expensive either."
2,What a rip off!,"In the original CD release from Rykodisc, we got music aplenty but sloppy sound quality. In this brand new rerelease under a new label, we get better sound quality but less tracks! ARRGH!!And as if to add insult to injury, the new cover art is terrible--this does NOT look like Marilyn Monroe is the least! It may seem a slight complaint to some, but I loved the cover art of Rykodisc's release much better.Looks like we'll all have to wait for the next label to pick this one up to do a better job. Better luck next time, I suppose... hopefully the old saying about three being a charm is correct..."
4,"Roy's timeless, engaging Jazz combo recording","Roy Hargrove is a young musician with incredible potential, mostly because he has paid attention to the quality of his sound.If the first note doesn't sound good it doesn't matter how many follow.With his sweet golden sound, he follows the Cool Jazz major figures Miles Davis, Chet Baker, and Stan Getz. Of these, his sound is most like Chet Baker, but perhaps with better technique. This CD a combination of Jazz standards and new and lesser known works, is his most engaging pure jazz album to date. He has a number of better know names sitting in.When I say this CD is timeless, but could have been recorded at the height of the Cool, in the 50's or 60's, that a high compliment.4 stars for a warm user-friendly album, the best he has done to date with a Jazz combo."
4,Excellent selection of tunes covering many influences.,"A project assembling music from two major inputs: music written for members of his immediate family and music relating to his ""musical-influences"" family. Wide range of special guests adding to the energy of Roy's basic group...too many to list."
5,Desert saints,This was a very good movie. It had a great story line and keeps you interested. Kiefer does a great job and even has a steamy love seen. Very nice.
3,sutherland and walters are great,"Sutherland(Truth or Consequences N.M.) is a killer who makes women become partners in crime, manily women and then kills them after hes done with them...this time he picks the wrong woman..Melora Walters(Magnolia) who in the end turns out to be a cop..the movie ends great...Walters thinks Sutherland's dead but then we see his feet come in view of the screen..which was a great ending..Jamey Sheridan(The Ice Storm and tv's Law and Order:Criminal Intent)also stars."
4,Riverside Jazzland Release,"This is not the worst Dexter Gordon album ever recorded as the 3 star reviewer implies and he made nowhere near 100 so I'm wondering about him. That would be 4-5 a year 1960-1980 - No wayIt's a sextet session for Riverside subsidiary Jazzland and the sound quality is down a bit from later Blue Note and Prestige recodings but compatable with other Riverside sessions made by others.Trombone solos on 4 tracks and trumpet on 3 of them. Dexter has 2 quartet tunes the fastest one, and the ballad. Piano always solos after the horns - No problem."
2,maya 4.5 savvy,"maya 4.5 savvy is just the old blue mastering maya book with a new cover, its the same stupid child and stupid dog from the previous version..very few ground breaking moments...they used to corner the maya instructional book market..but now they need new content..I don't reccomend it to my students.., however there is one beautiful image of a yellow rusted robot that is contriubuted by a third party artist"
1,tutorials are incomplete with mistakes,"I've been using Maya for 5 years now and bought this book for extra skills. I cannot believe that Alias endorses this. I tried the walk cycle tutorial, which has technical mistakes, if I didn't have the experience I do, I would be completely lost. The hand building tutorial is so cryptic as to where to add faces to the thumb to make it look like the illustration shown that I want to throw the book out the window. I wish I had read these reviews as well, do not buy this book!!!!"
3,Just observations,"I don't know much about comforters so i'm not sure if this is suppost to happen. During the night it was great, no feathers in the air and it had only a light warmth but after the 2ed day, I found feathers in the air and when I looked closely, feathers comming out of the comforter. The feathers didn't produce any allergys but it was still bothersome. Also, the lable clearly says that you can't wash it yourself. Hope this helps."
1,Feathers everywhere.,"The first few nights it was ok, then it started to leak feathers more and more. This 'leakproof' fabric they claim to use is crap, it leaks more after a few days than my grandmothers old comforter did after years of use. Beware. I am not happy about mine. I am trying to return it.. lets see if they at least honor their 30 day guarantee."
2,Dated,"OK, if you are into John Wayne nostalgia, but doesn't stand up well to contemporary film action, adventure or historical movies"
4,Pretty good,"Decent movie based on incredible story. Classic John Wayne, and cast of interesting figures. Never forget, and always remember the Alamo!"
4,"More fiction than fact,","Hollywood over the years has taken historic accouts and changed them in order to entertain their audience. This movie is no exception. I can remember as a grade school kid watching this epic and enjoying the movie for the wrong reasons.I remember watching the battle scenes and rooting for the Texans as they are slaughtered by Santa AnaThere are many liberties taken with this movie. It shows Santa Ana as being gallant instead of the barbarian he really was.Santa Ana executed prisoners under the white flag of truce at Goliad and after the battle of the Alamo.This movie is pure Hollywood with Travis drawing the line in the sand and all. We will never know if the line was actually drawn, but it does make a nice scene for the movie. What the movie does portay is the brave men who fought for a cause they believed in.If you want a more historical account then see the more recent version, released in 2004. This movie is very entertaining though."
3,Boring story - rousing finale!,"Final battle-scenes are second to none, but somebody should have wrote a storyline for Wayne to direct for the first two hours. With potential and fine production values, this movie could and should have been much better. Three stars are for final battle-scenes and a few good scenes in between. Wayne and Widmark are OK and so is Laurence Harvey -but why on earth did they have real ""brit"" playing col. William Travis?"
3,mixed feelings on this one,"I didn't realize it at the time I bought the dvd, but this isn't the director's cut that is found on the vhs, rather a slimmed down version (though why anyone would create a lesser version for dvd...I would think you'd want your dvd to be at least as good as the vhs). There is a 40 minute making of documentary on it, but the overall sound and picture quality is not a step up from video. Flunks the dvd test.It's tough to review the movie, since not all of it is here. But you have a larger than life actor playing a larger than life character in a larger than life incident in American history. And it is Wayne's debut as a director. Sort of all fits together. Maybe when MGM releases a complete version of the film I can give it five stars (and a more thourough review), but for now this is all I can do.And shame on you MGM."
3,A very good depiction of the Battle of the Alamo,"This movie was very good and entertaining most of the way through. The first tape was pretty slow, but the second tape was very accurate! If you're a John Wayne fan,you'll love it!"
2,painful to watch.....,"John Wayne as Davey Crockett? I rest my case. I gave it 2 stars because it is ~not~ as terrible as watching the Duke as a Roman Soldier or Genghis Kahn. Those 2 roles were beyond funny/bad. This is a bad movie with ""Hollywood-1950's- I hate commies"" written all over it. Stinks."
5,great movie,The Duke's Alamo is a fine film. So is Walt Disney's Davy Crockett and the 2004 Alamo with Billy Bob Thorton as a fine Davy Crockett. You can't beat all of these for excellent historical adventures.
1,GIVE US THE DIRECTORs CUT,"John Wayne, Richard Widmark, Laurence Harvey and the rest of the cast that portrayed the men who sacrificed their lives at the Alamo deserve the director's cut of this great American epic. This is an unforgettable movie but this version is very forgettable. Get the director's cut on VHS."
2,The Alamo DVD,"This version of John Wayne's The Alamo is 2 hr and 40 minutes from MGM. This is disappointing as MGM released the 3 hr and 20 minutes version on VHS several years ago. Missing from the DVD version are the ""Jeffersoian speech"" between Col. Travis and Capt. Dickinson, the ""death of Emil Sand"", ""conversation between Col. Travis and Col. Bowie regarding Col. Fannin"", the ""death of the parson"" and ""the Alamo defenders talking about God"" to name a few. The ""collectible booklet"" advertised is a two page fold out. I recommend anybody wanting to see The Alamo buy a copy of the restored orignial director's cut on VHS."
3,Good but. . .,"I saw this film when first released way back when. While John Wayne wanted to do a definitive account of the Alamo, this unfortunately was not it. Any film depicting a historical event is always subject to new facts being uncovered and this one is no exception. Much shown is based on fact and much is Hollywood embellishment. Either way it is a good movie.What you might expect from the DVD is not what you will get. Fortunately I do have the VHS director's cut with restored sound. The DVD is several iterations removed from the much superior VHS version. If you can locate the VHS, buy it, but if not this version will surfice until the studios get off their cheap-a$$ and release a remastered director's cut on DVD."
4,The Alamo,"This is definitely one of John Wayne's best movies. The all star cast really brings this epic Texas story to life. It is too bad that when it was released, Hollywood ignored it. Well, the American public did also, thus almost bankrupting John Wayne."
2,Where's the Blu-ray version??,"I don't even remember where I purchased the DVD version - but, I too noted the absence of the Overture, Entre Acte, Intermission and Exit Music. I don't remember if I ever owned the VHS version - but, may have sold it after I purchased DVD - believing I was getting a 1:1 replacement. I recently - this month being the anniversary of the actual battle - set out to purchase it on Blu-ray - and was shocked to find it wasn't available! Given the number of much lesser films that have been released on Blu-ray, does anyone have any idea why this one hasn't?? Is this possibly a carry-over from the original biased treatment following it's initial production/release (e.g., winning only one of seven oscar nominations)???"
2,The Alamo with John Wayne,"Having seen the wide-screen version, this video was very disappointing. I expected the same movie. I couldn't even sit through the first hour because they kept on cutting out parts that I remember from the full-length wide-screen version. Very disappointing considering you can't return videos that are viewed."
2,To Commit Treason...,"If I may commit treason in the eyes of all John Wayne fans--this was NOT the movie for him! Most of his roles (most notably ""True Grit"") he just fits into, as though they were written with him in mind (and most probably were). This one just doesn't work for him. John Wayne is NOT Davy Crockett; he just says the lines and valiantly dies when the script says the time is right."
4,"Dramatic-John Wayne""s Dream to Make","Nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture winning only 1 for Best Sound Great Picture ! Just wish directing by Duke was better. The Texans Died so we would be free! Filmed in Bracketville Texas on Happy Shanon""s Ranch.Still Open to this Day. A Classic Movie ! Would recomend this to Anyone"
2,"Boring,","If you want to waste 2-1/2 hours go ahead. Not worth watching it, slow and boring with a horrid ending."
1,Not the theatrical version,"This ""widescreen"" version has been severely cropped from the original theatrical version, and much of Wayne's widescreen composition is compromised. Although ponderous, it was a beautifully framed and shot film. Much of that is lost in an effort to keep it ""widescreen"" yet keep the image as tall as possible."
5,This movie is great,"I liked this movie because I love the story of the Alamo. I do suggest to teachers or parents that this movie is very graphic with people being blown to pieces and people dying, but teaches kids the dramatic story of the Alamo."
2,Remember the Alamo? Not this movie...,"If you like your history glossy or very watered down, this is the movie for you. Hey, loved Wayne in many, many movies BUT, as history buff and Texan, (San Antonio - no less) this is the most atrocious conveyance of history ever. After viewing this movie, one is lucky to know that there was a 'real' place called the Alamo and that somewhere along the way there was some battle in someplace called Texas. Umm, lemme see, the attack after sunrise, Bowie actually not bed-ridden, Travis dying by the sword and then breaking it? Yes, it's spectacle, it is wordy but historical IT IS NOT. Please save your money and buy a book on the Alamo by Walter Lord, ""A Time To Stand""."
2,Wasted Potential,"Maybe the most influential moive of my life (I saw it when it came in in 1960 when I was 10) I have since viewed it numerous times. The best part of the movie is the wonderful set and the music. But after learning what one can learn of this fight, it is almost too sad to see this movie as a typical 1950's flick. Terrible screenplay which lessens the grit that we want to bestow on the heroic dfenders. The ""Travis-Bowie"" conflict is tense, but historically misses the fact: they argued over command, not strategy. As for the set itself, I have been there 3 times and it is worth the visit. In some ways it holds the sense of the defenders isolation; the real Alamo in San Antonio has been altered so much that it is hardly recognizable. As for the ""truth"" of the Alamo itself? One must look into their own soul and find the meaning there. Bravo to the Duke for trying.....I still love Arthur Hunnicut the best...AND Fess Parker......but let's see who will do it next, and what they can do."
4,Amother Historic John Wayne winner in the tradition of the Fighting Seabees,Wayne and Rich Widmark outstanding inhere. Highly recommended! Pick Up On It!
2,JOHN WAYNE'S THE ALAMO,"HELP NEEDED FROM ALL YOU ALAMO FANSCan anyone let me know where I can get hold of a copy of the book titled ""John Wayne's the Alamo : The making of the epic film"" by Donald Clark & Christopher P Anderson. Many Thanks"
1,good movie for action,It is one of the worst movies on the alamo i have ever seen and it doesn't really show the alamo and the 187 men that were massacered there. It is totally inacurate and unrealistic. I like John Wayne and everything but this movie really sucks. If you want to see the real story try watching The Alamo: 13 days to glory.
2,"Overlong, preachy meladrama","""The Alamo"" was a vanity project for Wayne that he spent nearly fourteen years trying to get made. Unfortunately, he was so busy trying to push his conservative political agenda that he failed to make an effective movie. At over three hours long, it is meant to be an epic. Unfortunately the climatic battle lasted only an hour in real life and what led up to it was a long slow siege. The film might have been more effective if Wayne had built up the tension during the siege. Instead, his characters are too busy gving windy speaches and otherwise just occupying screen time. And as a villian, Santa Anna is completely colorless rather than being the classic movie bad guy that he should be. Overall, a would be classic that fell well short of the mark. Nice cinematography, though."
2,The Alamo,"This shortened version leaves out some critical scenes that were on the original that was on VHS. The originial had the most beautiful music before, in between, and after. But this version falls way too flat on all accounts. Why ruin a great movie that was a classic western?"
1,Not the Director's Version,"I want to warn others not to make the mistake I did. This is not that beautiful director's cut which was issued on Laser and VHS. If that is what you are looking for, WAIT.I am completely in awe why the studio would release the trimmed down version of this film on DVD!Please please release the 202 minute version."
2,DVD Disappointment,"Having the VHS version of this wonderful movie with surround sound and the director's cut I looked forward to the DVD being released. Unfortunately, the distributors have short changed all of us here by releasing the short version of the film with 2 Channel Stereo and no Overture, Intermission or Exit Music. Come on guys, look at what the VHS offers in content. Surely the DVD should be just as good or better!!!!!"
3,"Well intended movie, but edited","This movie was overdone with comic relief which distracted from the story somewhat, but compared to other versions of the Alamo, it is well intended and positive heroic portrayl of the battle and the men who fought it. I prefer John Wayne to the PC cynical versions. But this version has parts cut out, some of them quite important to the movie. Find the uncut version if you can, but this and Fess Parker's Davy Crockett are the best versions of the Alamo around to date."
4,Gold Tapestry Hand Needles-Size 26 3/Pkg,"These are good quality needles that I used for cross stitching. They did bend while using but I haven't found a needle that i haven't bent yet. They did tarnish after using for awhile, but I haven't found gold plated ones that haven't yet."
1,Keep Looking,"An otherwise very thorough book has been ruined by throwing in opinions. A book of this nature should be strictly fact; unfortunately the author decided to include her opinion on many items, i.e., humans are evolved from fish, etc.Keep looking."
1,Bigoted fairy tale as history,"This book is typical of the anti-Mormon rags that have been produced for over 100 years.Deputy U. S. Marshal Orrin Porter Rockwell is depicted as a murderous fanatic and ""Destroying Angel"" with such hyperbole and unfounded exaggeration that historians laugh and look upon the author with a mixture of disdain and pity.If you want to read a legitimate, well documented and footnoted biography of colorful Western lawman, rancher, and devout Christian, Orrin Porter Rockwell, see Dewey's ""Porter Rockwell, A Biography.""However, if you are an anti-Mormon bigot, love lurid yellow journalism and don't want historical facts and accounts to get in the way of your prejudices and preconceived notions, then read this book, if you can still find one. Most have been discarded as a waste of print and paper by the academic community."
1,Do Not Recommend,"Unfortunately is stopped working a month or so after I bought it at Target. I called the manufacturer and was told to send it to the repair center at my cost and wait 6 -8 weeks until they fix it and return it to me. Very poor customer service too, the technical support rep took a very long time getting my name, address, proceeded to spell my name military style several times...."
3,EuroPro Convection Oven,"I purchase this item it was a bit larger than expected, take up too much counter top space. Overall the design and asthetic look is pleasing but controls are not quite user friendly. For instance if you are using this oven and select a function to change the temperature or time, you would have to shut the oven off and restart with the new settings."
2,sorry I bought it,"Euro-pro T021 You cannot use it at 450. It goes into E-2 and cannot get it to do any thing except set the clock. This happen to me before , but after sitting a day, it finally decided to work again. I made the sad mistake of forgetting that it does not like temps over 350. So now I will wait till tomorrow and hope it will work again. There is nothing in the manuel for any error codes."
1,Bad oven,"Bad convection oven. It gives out toxic gas after two months of use. It won't turn off unless I unplugged it from the wall electrical outlet. Called the company's customer service twice. Both times, they hanged up the call while I was describing the problem.RandySan Jose, CA"
1,Piece of Junk!,"Had it only 2 weeks and both the clock and the timer stopped working. Start button works when it wants to, which isn't often. It's going back tomorrow. Don't waste your money!"
1,Stay clear of this,"Yes it looks great. But it is a design disaster. I gets so hot. Absolutely no insulation. Thats what the feet are for, to keep your counter top from blistering.The ""Digital"" component is a joke. It does not ever indicate what the temperature is inside the oven. If you set it to use the timer for instance, it begins the timer without consideration for preheating, so it is essentially useless.It seems to cook ok, but at 79.00 I think most other ovens probably would too. Euro-Pro... I think it was made in Iowa or someplace like that. The instruction manual was essentially useless and mainly devoted to attempting to limit their liability in case you burn yourself, or burn down your house with it. Stick to a Name Brand is my advice. This one is a joke."
5,hard swingin,"Everyone is taking long, energetic solos in front of a lively crowd. Johnny Griffin wails on his tenor sax. Roy Eldridge creates some amazing sounds on his trumpet. Bassist Niels Henning Orsted Pedersen swings as hard ever and takes amzing solos. Milt Jackson plays long creative riffs. Louis Bellson takes an awesome solo on ""Lester Leaps In"" after trading fours. And then, ofcourse, the Count: his performance is too amazing, and on ""Lester Leaps In"" he begins the song with 4 choruses of own special 'stride' piano which was popular in jazz' early days.The songs performed are the1. quick paced blues- ""Billies Bounce"" (Charlie Parker)13'35""2. the more relaxed ""Festival Blues"" (Basie, et al)11'54""3. ""Lester Leaps In"" (Lester Young) based off of Ive Got Rhythm 16'06"""
2,Disappointing,"I expected more from a Patricia Cornwell book than this delivered (and I pre-ordered based on her previous work!). Quite frankly, it was a reprise of her other novels, someone's out to ""get"" Dr. Scarpetta's position, there's sabotage in the lab, niece Lucy is stressed out again and Marino, is well, Marino and the most put together character in this book."
3,"Good, but maybe time to let these characters rest","The book was good but predictable. Maybe it's time to let Kay Scarpetta and friends have a vacation. I seem to be alone in my feelings about Southern Cross. I really liked it, although I didn't care for Hornet's Nest. Maybe Cornwell can start a new series with the characters from Southern Cross"
5,"intence, heart pounding suspence. two thumbs up.","Dr. Scarpetta really has to think to figure out who's ""it"" in this one. Several unrelated hits can only be coincidence. There is no coinceidence only trouble. Maybe even anew friend."
2,Not as good as others because the characters changed,"Maybe it's me, but Cornwell has turned Kay Scarpetta into a bitchy, controlling character - a most unpleasant person and probably horrible to work for. Marino is cynical and constantly complaining.Whatever happened to their professionalism?"
2,Not so Hot.....,"Could you just tell me when Kay is coming out already? And just how is it that every female Lucy is partnered with wants her hand in marriage? Poor Pete can't find a nice bowling alley babe, but Lucy has no problems here... As has been the case of late, I was disappointed by Black Notice. A very interesting case and intriguing departmental politics all go nowhere. I love Scarpetta and wish that Cornwell would return to old form; writing a true mystery and not a novel worthy of Oprah's book club. I am left with more questions at the very speedy end of this novel than answers (why did the killer's parents hide him? Why does Kay 'not love' her sister? Why is Lucy absurdly angry?? Isn't there one woman in Richmond who can appreciate Pete Marino? And when is Kay going to realize that she really is the perfect role model for her niece?) Let's hope the next one is better...."
2,"Disappointing, at best","I am an avid reader of Pat Cornwell's novels. Point of Origin was heartwrenching. But I was extremely disappointed with Black Notice. It was disjointed, vulgar, and implausible. PLEASE BRING BACK BENTON!!!!"
3,The book started off well then sort of dies,"I love Patricia Cornwell's novels, but this one just loses steam. I think that Cornwell is making the characters too negative and self absorbed. Additionally, the book drives a couple good story lines and they all just die out or are dropped. It is almost like she wrote the book and about 75% through it, she just got tired or distracted and just ended the book. I think in another 50 well thought out pages, she could have turned this book from a C- to a solid B. I have read or listened to all of the Scarpetta books.Keep Scarpetta, but drop the childish thoughts."
2,Cornwell can do better,"I was reading through some of the reader reviews and one reviewer called Marino the most ""put together"" character in the book and I realized with a start that this was true! How unexpected that this overeating, cigarette-smoking, tough and prejudiced cop would be the one to stay grounded, while ""Bang Bang"" Lucy struggles to stay balanced and Kay struggles to find peace and people that aren't out to get her. Problem is, I buy the Scarpetta books to read about Kay and her WORK, not the emotional stuff, and not to see how 90's Marino is becoming. Great forensics, as always, but a mess of emotions, a mess of a plot, and a silly ending that was just too abrupt."
3,depressing,"I agree with alot of the other readers, after I finished this book I found that I was depressed. Her last couple of books have been very disappointing. I also found the book very angry and there was alot of loose ends in the book. At the end I had to read it a couple of times because it went so fast I thought I was missing something. I usually buy all her books but I think I might wait to get the next one from the library."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"Sadly lacking, Ms Cornwall either needs to improve her own spirits or at the least, improve the spirits of her characters. Not only are they depressing but, even worse, they are boring. This book reads like a poor quality soap opera with little to redeem it. Suggest the author pass the antidepressants around or find lives for the good doc, Marino and her agonizingly nasty niece."
1,"first time ""Cornwell"" reader","I thought I would see why Cornwell's books are always on the bestseller list, and after reading ""Black Notice"" I'm still wondering. There is way too much dialogue that added nothing to the plot. I also expected to find more action. Maybe I just need to read more of her books so that the familiarity of the characters becomes the important reason to read."
5,Another disappointment from Patricia Cornwall...,bottom line - spend your money more wisey!A HUGE disappointment given her earlier books- is this one ghostwritten?
2,same o same o,"As I read this book, I kept having the feeling of I might have read it before but forgot the title and accidently bought it again. The office problem, Kay's threat from the criminal and the boss, etc. are almost the same as in the other books, and the ending was also very disappointing."
2,Kay Scarpetta stumbles,"A 200 page story in a 415 page book. Enough with Lucy and her love life! Get back to science and medicine, elements that made the previous books so enjoyable. Please give us more than a 1 page climax in the next book. Worth reading in paperback, definitely not worth the hardcover price."
3,Might Have Been Good...,"Kay Scarpetta was interseting and intriguing in the first books of the series. But now everything seems more of the same and the characters make you madder than ever. It seems that the people in Cornwall's novel have some strange ways of showing their emotions and seem a little too fake at times. Some parts of it seem to copy one of her earlier books, Body of Evidence. This made it seem like the same old story. It's a book that is worth reading but not one that I would run out and buy the instant it hit the shelves. I won't discourage others from reading it but some of her other books are a little better. I can't wait for the next installation in the Kay Scarpetta series, regardless of this book."
2,what a disappointment,"Patricia Cornwell has become quite the disappointment. Her earlier books were all exciting; I couldn't ""put them down"". Now I doubt that I'll ever ""pick another one up"". The plot never got off the ground and the ending was a real let-down. Sorry Ms. Cornwell, you've lost a fan here!"
2,Not At All Like Patricia Cornwell,"I was very disappointed with this particular book. I was hanging in there until about the last 25 pages or so. We got to France and the book just fell apart. It wasn't that great to start with, but some hairy guy. Please. The romance was wrong, the Lucy character is disgusting and just rude. I love Patricia Cornwell, but at the French trip I was ready to throw the book in the trash. I suffered through, but I hope this is her worst, and I will look for suggestions from you other readers for my next. I have not lost faith in this author. Even her wrost has a way of always holding my interest. To me this is a great writer, who just decided to write crime novels. She has great potential."
3,"A darker Dr. Kay this time around, dark book","In BLACK NOTICE, Patricia Cornwell shows us a darker and colder Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Though Cornwell has always been good at displaying Dr. Scarpetta's inner emotions, this time around, her emotions make for a dark book. Despite the unusually dark nature of this book, it is still worth a read.As a native son of Virginia, I always look forward to reading a Cornwell novel. This time around, a body has been found in a boat at the Harbour of Richmond. This badly decomposed body leads to the hunt for a French killer calling himself The Werewolf. This hunt is international, but even so, no one is safe. Not even Dr. Kay.This novel deals with several issues: grief, fowled up drug busts and the effects thereof, violent crimes, homosexuality, and a rare medical condition. If any of these issues bother you,then don't read this novel. If you are an avid Scarpetta fan, or a fan of books of this nature, read BLACK NOTICE."
1,very vague werevolftale,"After writing a couple of really good books, PC started to massproduce kay scarpetta mysteries. This is really a massproduct without a single unique or original idea, and only based on the relations between the different characters of the stories. The characters also have become boring as their personalities are only getting some more details without any deeper contents. absolute rubbish"
1,"Ms Cornwell, you've forgotten to finish this...","A prize is surely required for the most abrupt ending! The book itself was fine - it kept me turning until 2.00am, but the end was unbelievable, with no expansion or elaboration of the plot details. Like a bad TV movie in this regard. An acceptable book with a completely unacceptable end."
2,"Lousy. And, oh, the angst","The angst and psycho babble are much too much and too Hollywoody adolescent. This seems to be less a novel by itself and more her editor's strikeouts from Point of Origin - like the cuttings on a film editor's floor. The book drags and the emotional pain -- oh the pain, oh the pining, oh the melodrama, oh the psychological analysis -- pleeeze. Sophomoric. Reeks of being put together hastily for a deadline. Having read similar readers' comments about her newest novel, it sounds as if her good books are sadly all in the past. They were great while they lasted."
1,disappointed again,"Read all of her books except Winter Table, and the first 5 or so I couldnt put down, really couldnt put them down. The last few have been so hard to read, I forced myself to read them, knowing I couldnt love EVERYTHING she wrote, waiting for the old Scarpetta to return. But she only gets more and more arrogant. And like most other reviews, I too, am bored with the Lucy character. And I too, read the reviews on this site before reading the book, but read it anyway, just hoping... What's wrong with Cornwell? Her characters are now shallow, too predictable, and boring where they should be familiar, comfortable, and anxious to solve these mysteries. I dont know if I will read any more of her books. I surely wont BUY any more."
1,Author going downhill slowly,"I have read all her books and like many serial authors,Cornwell seems to feel she must include either devient sex or outrageous language.This book doesen't come close to the way people act.Three examples come to mind:the secretary suffering the loss of a husband but unable to carry on after the loss of a shopkeeper,Marino's absolute stupidity in Europe and Kay's mourning over her loss for a year.Her whole department suffers because she is in never-never land.It is too bad that she doesen't have some intellegent everyday chacters because her topic,a female medical examener, is wonderful.This will be the last Patricia Cornwell I will read"
1,Let's put it together,"Over 300 reviews so far, let's summarize the half of them (although I found many very funny): Cornwell's first 3-4 Scarpetta novels were, without a doubt, excellent. These books had a good storyline and believable characters, but in the meantime the series has hit rock bottom and started digging. I am so fed up with Kay's constantly miserable life! Lucy is a spoiled brat and she should have been killed instead of Benton (although he was pretty boring too). What happened to Marino? Come Ms Cornwell, you owe your readers more than this poor little effort. I agree with another reader that Cornwell should write a psychiatrist into her next novel and get her characters a therapy.If there's no other way then end the Scarpetta series and start something new. This is not the way to go! As far as I am concerned I won't waste money on another book. This is so depressing!"
4,Black Notice,Cornwell continues to create a great story line piggy backing on her last Scarpetta novel. It is always well written and full of suspense. Her knowledge of the medical field helps to bring the novel into a more realistic and visual concept of what is read. Description of characters and their emotions generate the necessary help to keep you interest and captures you while wadeing through what sometimes is a lengthily reading. Over all damm good book.
5,Black Notice (Scarpetta),"I am very happy w/my purchase. The book is a used book and was in very good condition as stated on the Amazon website. I was, at first, a little hesitant in purchasing used books but I would recommend this to everyone who loves to read and who buys many books."
3,Kay needs therapy,"Over the years, Dr. Scarpetta has become increasingly morose, and her 'glass half empty' life is becoming tedious to read about. Ms. Cornwell certainly puts her through alot, as well as Marino and Lucy.The mystery itself was intriguing, but the office shenanigans were over the top, and instead of getting lost in her books, as I usually do, I found myself speeding through just to see how it ended. Kind of like inhaling a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, instead of slowly savoring a juicy steak. I think Kay needs to go see her shrink, or maybe just eat some Cheerios.There are too many real people who live victorious lives in spite of incredible difficulty in the real world, which makes it hard to feel empathy or sympathy for the depressing Scarpetta. Get it together Kay- we love ya!"
3,"This entry is middle of the ""pack.""","While I finished this book at midnight, after only two nights, I'm not sure it's one of her better ones. The wolf theme is creepy, I'll give it that, but the interpolice agency intrigue and someone trying to sabotage Scarpetta at work (someone posing as her on email, etc) are old themes that are a bit tired.I'm not sure how Lucy and Jo got together. I must be forgetting the previous book.It's typical Cornwell, though the forensic work is not as thorough or as interesting.I supposed it's a must for followers of the series. I concur to start with previous ones, but I'd suggest Postmortem or All that Remains. Then work into my favorite, From Potters' Field (not sure if I got the title right...)"
2,There is No Hope,"Unfortunately I gave Cornwell yet another chance to return to the form that made her early books gripping and a worthy read. This one is filled with the now trite themes we've seen before: power brokers plotting against Kay to remove her from her job, internal suspicions at the office, the angst of her personal life, the sniveling and relationships of niece Lucy, and what appears to be the ever increasing stupidity of Marino. The only refreshing thing in this book is that the villian is not apprehended in the bedroom of her home. Thank you Kay for running outside. Sorry Patricia, no more for me."
1,Black is the operative word.,"I found myself struggling to finish this book. Normally I can't put a Cornwell book down. I read from cover to cover almost in one sitting.BLACK NOTICE, and it's predecessor, POINT OF ORIGIN were books that got shuffled to the back of the bookshelf for when I didn't have anything else to read. It appears that Cornwell is moving away from the stand-alone novel and moving into the area of novel-in-serial, where in order to understand one you must read the earlier works. Some of the twists and turns will be explained in the later book, LAST PRECINCT, if you can hang on for that long of a journey.Scarpetta still solves her crimes but she appears to be doing it while whining and complaining. I'll read her next books because I want to see where she takes this character, but I won't buy them."
4,Suspense unlimited.,"I could not wait until I was able to purchase Black Notice. All of P. Cornwall's books have their twists and turns, but I feel she outdid herself in Black Notice. The suspense was at times almost unbearable. I wanted to skip past descriptive words, or turn the page before I was finished to find out immediately what had occurred. You could taste her fear, anxiety and worry. One must admire Scarpetta's spirit, her ability to conquer her fear, to think logically, and stay focused in spite of her entire world and career seemly about to crumble. I ended up crying with her, worrying with her and ultimately surviving despite of her great loss. Waiting for the next book in the Scarpetta series!"
1,Don't waste your time on this uninspired nonsense,"I felt ongoing instances of deja vu while reading ""Black Notice"" -- same characters acting the same way, and repetitive plot devices that Cornwell has used ad infinitum. The main characters do not grow or change at all during the course of the novel, and the rest of the cast is as thin as the pages they are written on.Someone needs to teach the author the difference between foreshadowing and telegraphing. I won't reveal the unsatisfying ending, but any reader will know after the first 25 pages where this one is headed. I believe several other Scarpetta books have ended in the exact same fashion.The only thing remarkable about this book is the lack of any type of suspense. And the only mystery is that Cornwell is paid so much to write so poorly. Let's hope she invests some of that cash in taking courses at the local community college. She could use some tutoring on plot and characterization."
3,Far-fetched and ultimately a letdown.,"Black Notice was a tolerable book until about three-fourths of the way through, when all the mysteries are basically solved. After that, we're just waiting for the deranged killer to come after Kay. And then....after toting her gun and worrying about her home security system through the whole book....Kay lets the killer in!! Duh! How stupid is that? My first and last Cornwell book."
1,PLEASE DR. SCARPETTA GO TO AN A.A. MEETING.,"IF DR. SCARPETTA SPENT AS MUCH TIME WORKING IN HER MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE AS SHE DOES DRINKING, SMOKING, AND LUSTING OF MEN AND HER NIECES LOVERS MAYBE SHE WOULD ACTUALLY SOLVE A CRIME. WHEN THE BAD GUY COMES RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR, DON'T ANSWER UNLESS YOUR DESPARATE FOR A DRINKING BUDDY. IT'S HORRIBLE WRITING AND TERRIBLE STORY BUT I READ ALL OF MS. CORNWELL'S BOOKS AND WILL PROBALY READ THE NEXT ONE. MS. CORNWELL PLEASE SOBER UP YOU AND YOUR EDITOR."
1,"Kay don't open the door, reader don't open the book",The author has lost all respect for her characters and her readers. I've read all the Kay Scarpetta novels this was the last. A complete dud.
1,Lousy read- can't believe so many people actually liked it.,"If this is Patrica Cornwall style I won't be wasting my time on her books. Found it outlandishly dull. Hard to finish and when I did I thought what a waste of time. Give me Grisham, Clancy, Patterson, Clark,Glenn but not Cornwall."
2,What happened to this series?,"I used to enjoy the Scarpetta series, beginning with the first novel, Post-Mortem. I drifted away after From Potter's Field, because I was tired of serial killers. What I enjoyed about those first novels was the realistic setting, characters and scales of the crime. I started reading again with the last novel and now this one. The characters have become unrealistic, jet-setting James Bond types, although James Bond doesn't spend so much time whining and complaining. These are really unpleasant people investigating ridiculously complicated crimes. This book's minor characters and sub-plots make no sense (Diane Bray?) and Cornwell's technical writing skills have deteriorated terribly. She also seems so focused on some kind of personal agenda about women and sexuality . . . I don't understand what's happened to this series."
4,Excellent!! I LOVED EVERY LINE OF IT!!!!,"Patricia Cornwell just keeps getting better and better. With each book I feel closer to Kay, Marino,and lucy. Only Ms. Cornwell can make such characters come alive so well!! This novel keeps your interest from the start, and your heart goes out to Kay, Lucy and Marino while they fumble through their feelings about benton's demise.... But is he really gone? how did Jay find out so much about Kay? With every new novel you learn a little more about it's main characters so they become real..I for one want to feel like I've jumped right into the book and am one of the bystanders along for the ride, and Ms. Cornwell acomplishes that for me each time!!"
2,Cornwell Still Off-Track,"Patricia Cornwell continues her downhill slide. Although not as bad as her last several books, Black Notice is a big disappointment. The story line is full of holes, questions and unrealistic nonsense. The book also has an unpleasantly misogynistic tone, especially when dealing with the odious Diane Bray. I can only assume Patricia Cornwell's personal issues are spilling over into her work. Bring back the old, intriguing Kay Scarpetta and gang, not this whiny bunch."
3,Disappointing.,"Started out good but the plot never developed fully. No insight into the killer's mind. And the end just happened as though she just needed to stop before she wrote more than a certain number of pages -- plus the ending was predictable. Once again, her niece comes to the rescue."
4,I'm hooked on this author after listening to this audio book,This is the first time I have listened to this author's book. I am on the road all the time and audio books is the way to travel. I couldn't wait to get back in the car to listed to it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because at times it was a little unbelievable but it's entertaining!
2,Not up to par.....,I have read all of Patricia's books. This book took me forever to get through. I found it very hard to believe everyone was out to get Kay. Lucy needs some new focus........I have always liked all of her characters....but this book just didn't endear them to me. Will be difficult to rush to buy the next book in this series......and I buy many books! I will read the reviews on the next one before I buy another disappointment.
3,Good story but missing some zip,"I love Patricia Cornwell's books. I enjoy reading them because they deal with the same charaters which makes following the story line easy. However, I believe the characters need to be broadened. The have become stale. Dont get me wrong I enjoyed the book I just think it could have been better. I would still recommend it and I will continue to buy her books, at least for now. One last thing, The ending was awful. It just ended. I was really annoyed that I had read this entire book only to have that ending. I was left wanting so much more from this book. It was almost as if she just got tired and said ok THE END."
4,"Well written, poignant, chilling","I read quite a few negative reviews about Black Notice on Amazon.com before I finally managed to get my hands on a library copy a few days ago. I must say I disagree with others' assessments that Cornwell 'sleepwalked through this one'. The first 72 pages gripped my heart and I fail to see how anyone who has read her previous Scarpetta books could not have been impacted by the depth of the character's grief over her lovers' death and impressed by Cornwell's eloquent expression of it. Reading is easy, writing is not. I think she did a marvelous job conveying inexpressible emotions--and in in dialogue, yet! I read more books in a month than most people read during a year, and I read everything Cornwell writes because she writes well. Her Scarpetta books are my favorites, and this one is surely as good as the previous books in the series. Cornwell is the mystery/ suspense author of the 90's. I give it 4 stars. You go, Patricia!"
5,My favorite so far...,"I really enjoyed this book. Although I do enjoy these books, it is sometimes hard for me to get through them. I had no such problem with this one. I read it from beginning to end and have started again.I seriously related to Kay's, Lucy's and Marino's actions as a result of their grief and, in my opinion, they were very realistic. I also liked the introduction of Jay Talley to the story. I can't wait to see his development in the next book and how he continues to interact with Kay and Marino."
2,not as good as other scarpetta novels,"I was slightly dissapointed with this book. There was very little character development, and the plot starts out with a bang then drags out, before it is wrapped up in very few chapters."
3,Disjointed and abrupt,"Being a avid Patricia Cornwell fan I was a little disappointed with this creation. The character development was once again very discriptive but lacked continuity. I feel that Lucy's achievements are becoming a little far fetched and slightly unrealistic. Some characters for example Anderson and Jo seemed like add ons and afterthouchts. However it is a good read and as usual draws the reader in. However the ending was so abrupt, I was left feeling absolutely robbed and was dissatisfied, I felt there could have been a more intense ending than the one chosen."
1,It would get none if that was available in the menu,"I loved Postmortem. I have read all her books hoping that they will return to that level. This one didn't, not even maybe! I highly suggest that you should skip it unless you have _nothin'_ else to read! What a waste of paper and time!"
2,Not up to her usual standards,"Cornwell seemed to be resting on her laurels with ""Black Notice"". I found the story to be disorganized and hard to follow. She introduces several elements, but then goes nowhere with them. I felt the story ended with several threads left hanging, or with forced conclusions. She would have done better to simplify the plot and leave out some of the extraneous story lines."
1,black notice,I have read all of her books. The last two have been just terrible. She has lost her touch. Try Nelson Demille- he is outstanding!
4,It's Not a stand alone book.,"You have to read, ""Point of Origin"" in order to enjoy this book. The events of Point of Origin.......drive the story line, especially the first half of the book.If you read both books, you will enjoy both. If you read this one separately, you will be disappointed."
4,INTERESTING,"I have started reading the earlier Kay novels. And now that I have finished this one, I understand the complex personalities. I now realize that all of these characters relied on Benton to reaffirm their position in life. Kay has a really bad issue with trust. Her sister is not a very nuturing parent or sister. Dorothy is completely jealous of Kay. Lucy is stuck in her circumstances and is very needy. Marino is still in love with his wife and Kay. He knows well that Kay will never feel the same way, so he completely smitten with jealousy. The one thing that all these characters have in common, they are all afraid to deal with themselves. Benton was their safety net. I really like the odd twist of this book. I must admit my disappointment with Diane Bray's death. I think Kay really needs somebody to go toe to toe with. Diane and Kay would have been a nice rivarly."
5,ENTERTAINING,"What a grumpy, grouchy bunch of charaters. Beside the fact I found my self in an ill frame of mind, I,as usual, totally enjoyed this Patricia Cornwell book."
1,Leftovers,"This is the worst of the lot - close to Hornet's Nest. Have been a fan and read all of the books twice, but this one screamed with angry characters and predictable plot. Much of the plot seemed to come from past stories. Maybe this one was just for therapy - Kay's, Pete's, Lucy's & Pat's."
3,Kay Scarpetta back to her good ole' self!,"Wonderful book. Nice to see Cornwell and Scarpetta back together again. I missed that dynamite duo! Marino will never change! His sarcasm, knows everything, got to be right attitude is fantastic! How Scarpetta can put up with him is beyond me. Good job on the novel Patricia. I expected a little more up close and personal suspense, but you kept my interest from front to back. No, I couldn't put it down! I recommend to everyone who has enjoyed Dr. Scarpetta and Marino! GET IT! NOW!!!!"
1,"If you must read this, get it from the library.","Isn't there supposed to be at least one likeable character in a book? Every character in this book was depressing, with no redeeming qualities. Scarpetta spent the entire book feeling sorry for herself. Marino is a drunken bum. Lucy is a walking time bomb. I don't remember Benton being such a great guy. Why has his death destroyed so many lives?"
2,Disappointed!,"The book started off strong. I was really getting into to it, I didn't want to put the book down, until the end. What a disappointing ending, it's as if Patricia Cornwell didn't know where she was going with the story so she decided to quickly throw an ending together. It didn't do the book justice!"
2,"Been there, done that...","Imagine escaping death at the hands of a crazed killer, not once, not twice but over and over and over again and still making the same stupid mistakes. Perhaps Dr. Kay Scarpetta has a death wish... Why would someone trained to deal with death not know all the stages of mourning, and not seek counseling?Why is it such a big deal that Lucy is gay and why is she protrayed as such a loose cannon?To say I wasn't at all pleased with this read which was slow going until the halfway point would be an understatement. Unless Dr. Scarpetta and her niece get some psychiatric help, I won't be following her exploits any more."
3,Where does the author want to go?,"I don't know why the author created another new man for Kay. Her life is stressful, so she needs a help. Yes, I agree. But there are a few people who want to help her, but can't because she doesn't want them to help her. To avoid them, Kay falled in love with another man. I don't like such a way to solve the problem with people who love me and whom I love."
3,Black Notice,"I was disappointed in this book. It wasn't nearly as exciting as some of the earlier ones. It's almost as though her style of writing has changed over the series. I hope The Last Precinct will be better, but some of the reviews I've seen makes me doubtful."
2,Cornwell Still Clogging,"After I read her last book, Point of Origin, I was hesitant in buying into Ms. Cornwell again. Being optimistic, I bit for this one. And it did not bite back. In fact it gummed me to death. Did anyone else find the dialogue so cluttered a dustbuster couldn't clear it up? I do not like to *dis* any book or any author, they do something I cannot--write. However, in good faith, I cannot recommend Black Notice due to poor plot, dialogue, & frustrating folly.other reading suggestions: ""Bleeding Out"" by Baxter Clare, ""Ashes To Ashes"" by Tami Hoag, and ""Manhattan Is My Beat"" by Jeffrey DeaverThanks for your interest & comment vote--CDS"
2,Patricia's been watching too much X-files.....,"Oh, my. What is with this whole conspiracy thing. Let me premise this by saying that I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and was looking forward to this one coming out, but what a disappointment! Why must Lucy somehow be connected to all of Kay's cases. How realistic is that. Oh, how I wish that she would go back to the earlier storylines where there was just some serial killer out there, and Kay and Marino just went out and did their jobs instead of all of this highly implausible international intrigue that Ms. Cornwell makes us plod through. I don't know how many more books that Ms. Cornwell can put out about these characters, because they're apparently all about to have nervous breakdown's! If you're also sick of these crazy plot twists, check out Kathy Reich's books, they're alot like the early Cornwell ones. Pure science and thriller, none of this crazy mess."
1,Black Notice,"I have loved the Scarpetta series from Post-mortem. I was appalled at the foul language used throughout this book and the lack of a plot. I was hoping that this book would be better than ""Hornet's Nest"" and ""Southern Cross"" but I rate them the same. Point of Origin went back to her original writings but I'm not sure I'll read another. Very disappointing."
1,The details of autopsies on burned bodies,"The story was farfetched, drawn out, and the characters improbable. But worst-the details of autopsies on burned bodies revolted me, a surgeon of many years"
1,Very Disappointing,"I have read most of Patricia Cornwell's books and I have a hard time believing that the characters just seem to stand still and don't grow in any way. Marino seems to be a cartoon character built upon every generalization of middle-aged overweight men you ever heard of, Kay Scarpetta just can't be that unaware (we all knew the suspect was outside the door and who was stealing in the morgue). A book about Lucy could be very interesting at this point, she seems to have growth potential. I was disappointed with the overall story and the complete lack of character growth - no one here seems to have learned anything from their past."
1,Tiresome,"Lucy is angry. Marino is angry. Kay is angry. I've read and enjoyed every one of the Kay Scarpetta novels up until now, but the characters have become as predictable as taxes. Even those who made their debut in this one -- Diane Bray, Jay Talley, Det. Anderson -- are cardboard. To add insult to injury, the dialogue was often inane and we learned virtually nothing about the killer other than bizarre surface facts. Looks like Patricia Cornwell phoned this one in."
5,SCARPETTA DOES HAVE CLAY FEET!!!,"I enjoyed this novel, contrary to what other reviewers thought.Scarpetta as a role model - COME ON!! She's a character in a book, whoin this most recent effort, has seemed to have joined the rest of us mere mortals in her ability to grieve, get depressed, relapse smoking, and feel out of control. I was beginning to get sick of the Scarpetta novels - I felt Kay was too much of a machine - a boring know-it-all. I think this book approaches ""The Body Farm"" and her other earlier efforts, where the characters were believable, sympathetic, and not-to-perfect. So there's a new love interest, and he's younger - SO WHAT? I'm looking forward to the next Scarpetta book - I feel like my old friends are back!"
1,Just not worth the time,"This book compounded the disappointment I felt when reading the last Kay Scarpetta novel. If I wanted to read about love, sex, anger, grief and subsequent angst I wouldn't buy a book touted as a mystery. The real enchantment of the beginning books in these series was Kay Scarpetta as a professional in the fascinating field of forensic pathology. Her character was fleshed out in a realistic way by her relationships with Lucy, Marino and Benton AND there was real mystery to be solved. Now, Lucy is a basket case and so is Kay. Benton is dead and may be lucky at that and poor Marino isn't getting the attention his character deserves. Bray and her sidekick are one dimensional (where in the world did they come from?) and the sub-plots were an annoying distraction. My overall impression is that the author is falling apart. It is my sincere hope that she gets back together. But in the meantime don't waste your time with this book."
1,Where has Scarpetta gone?,"This series has not gone the way I'd hoped. Kay used to be a great medical examiner completely committed to solving crimes. Now she's an emotional basketcase and I'm forced to read about it. Lucy is dangerous as well as an emotional basketcase, and Marino is half the cop he used to be. The plots are unrealistic and closer to melodrama than gritty crime stories.The series is getting stranger and I don't like it."
4,Patricia Cornwell does it again!,"In keeping with the entire Kay Scarpetta series, (Hornet's Nest, although good missed a key ingredient - Kay Scarpetta), I read this book as I have every one of Cornwell's writings - while waiting at red lights, in the bath tub, loading the dishwasher, etc. It was impossible to put down! Patricia Cornwell hits the mark of intrigue, keeps Marino loveable, and picks a great psychodrama mystery. I'm not sure there was any point in going to Europe - that left me a little cold - thus the 4 stars - but I do not vote for the potential replacement of Benton as intimated in Black Notice. Let's give Kay someone up to her par......rebounds are fine, but not this one.Keep Kay active in our lives....I await her new adventure with baited breath!"
2,A disappointment,"I really love her Scarpetta-books, but this is a true disappointment. Wimsical, sometimes uncomprehensive. And the end are so flat and short that you wonder if you lost the last twenty pages. There's a lot of promising plots that Cornwell starts but she seems too unfocoused to give them a satisfactory solution. And please, Madame Scarpetta, stay in Richmond. The Paris excursion with the ""Hunchback from Notre Dame""- theme are a bit too thick for European-audience."
2,Good start ....... weak finish,"A good strong start with 'traditional' attention to detail in both setting and characterisation. However I am unsure how many of the Scarpetta novels have now featured the criminal at Kay's doorstep. Move house, change telephone number, get better security ..... develop an original ending? Do something to save this enjoyable character (and another Southern Cross is most definitely not the answer!)"
5,Cornwell at her best!,"I think it is Patricias best book and I'm looking forward to read the rest of the stories about Kay S. If you got sad after Point of Origin you will really work through the feelings with Kay, and I think Patricia does this really well. I cried a lot with the character, but at the other hand it was also very revealing, she gets deeper into the Kay character. The nice turn in the end helped it up to a clear five star."
2,"Great characters, good science, but no clue on plot","Scarpetta is a detail freak in her work but has no concept of follow-through in her life. Things happen that are just ignored, it seems like the plots are a pastiche of paragraphs about Scarpetta which are forced into a chronology by her editor. The woman can write; I wish she'd take a story idea, outline it to figure out what she wants to say and where she wants to go, then go there. There's brilliance, and great sentences, solid characters, good science. But what holds them all together? The binding."
1,"Dark, brooding, and dull.",The majority of the book is spent tangling and untangling relationsips that have little bearing on the plot. And speaking of plot...where was it. The book drags on forever only to have everything wrapped up in less than 20 pages. This book has no relation to the earlier solid writings in the other Scarpetta novels. Though not a total waste of time this is one book better left on the shelf or at least wait for the Cliff notes to come out.
1,Distracting and Disappointing Read,"Cornwell presents a crime and then goes way out into left field with distractions, sub-plots and too much anger. She should have kept with the forensics that she does well."
5,She's back,"After struggling through her past three or so novels, Patricia Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta are back. The story takes place just a scant year after Benton is killed at the hands of Lucy's first lover, Carie Grenthorn, and Kay is still reeling from the horrific loss of her true soulmate. Out pops an unidentified, putrifying body from a shipping container that originated in Europe. To add to the already captivating story, Marino develops his own problems with a female boss who seems determined to rid him of his job and his sanity. Towards the end, the reader is tempted to forsake everything just to find out what is going to happen. I found myself warning Kay out loud in a room full of children as I supervised a lunch detention. In my opnion, this is one of Ms. Cornwell's very best efforts, and I have read them all."
1,"Yikes - Sadly, this was a terrible book","It's pretty easy to describe my feelings about this book:""It's terrible - don't bother - I will never buy another book from this book series - the end has come.""I used to love reading Patricia Cornwell's books. Oh well, it must be hard to keep the characters and plot lines fresh for such a long time.I'll have to find another author to replace this one."
2,BLACK NOTICE blackly noticed,"Any book with 275 reviews doesn't need another but--being from Richmond and all (note to author: VA State employees do not have access to AOL. Note to Readers: any comparison between Marino and an actual Richmond police captain is insulting.) Gave this two stars because the first 1/3 is paced briskly; a few new characters are introduced (non-serial killing non-monsters). Things are looking good. Then Kay goes to Paris, and it's all over. Her monster is laughable, it drags, you don't care, and your spirits lift at the end because you know it's almost over.You heard it here first. She's going to kill off the obnoxious Lucy. We'll have to suffer through Kay's spasms & histrionics of grief, but it will be well worth it to never be confronted by that wretched girl again."
2,Where is the story?,"This is my first Patricia Cornwell book, and I'm disappointed. The dialog is sharp and not convincing. The book reads more like a made-for-TV mini-series than of a novel. There is an excessive number of subplots, none of which deal with catching the ""werewolf"". I'll give her one more shot to impress me."
2,plot got lost in a rushed ending,"i thought i had misunderstood previous reviews and that this was going to be one of the better books. what a confusing plot; then to end the book as quickly and as incompletely totally irritated me. i don't think i've ever walked away from a cornwell thinking that it was a waste of time and money but this time, as much as i hate to admit it, i did. for a beter read, plick of james patterson's new: pop goes the weasal"
2,Good yarn but too many sub-plots.,"Come on, Ms. Cornwell, lighten up! Black Notice was a splendid yarn about a Werewolf but so many sub-plots were thrown in, the character-development and his origins were buried. I have always loved big, brusque, protective Marino but in this one his disgusting behavior was a real turn-off. He typified the ""ugly American"" when they were in France. And where was your usual grand and glorious ending tying in all the loose ends? This one seemed to just abruptly stop.From the description of the killer, with his long body hair, ugly face and pointy teeth, it was completely illogical that SOMEONE didn't spot him long before the end."
4,Pretty Typical!,"If you like Kay Scarpetta's adventures, this is more of same. Same Kay, same Lucy, same Merino, only more so. I think some new blood is indicated for this series, the new love interest sounds like he may not last but if Kay ever perks up she may enjoy herself. I wish we could find out more about Marino's mysterious son. Anyway, I enjoyed this book even though it's similar to all the others, though I felt the villain was ludicrous and the ending was so abrupt she may as well have written ""end of part I"" for a closing sentence. One thing I didn't like - I know you have to be a tough specimen to be a police woman, not to mention Detective or Chief, but did Bray and Anderson HAVE to be portrayed as such repellent, evil, slimey, perverted SERPENTS? They were one step above the loup garrou, if you ask me. I enjoyed ""Black Notice"" but will be disappointed il future stories follow the same ol' same ol' angst of our three heroes."
3,"Good book, but not up to Conrwell's usual standards","I, like everyone else who reviewed this book, have been an avid Cornwell fan. I enjoyed this book and finished it in two days, but was not left with the ""I'm dying for another one"" feeling I usually have after her books. The love/sex encounter seemed totally ridiculous and out of place to me. I was ashamed of and embarrassed for Kay. I usually enjoy Lucy's character and don't mind her being ""difficult"", but in this book she was worse than a thirteen year old pubescent. Grow up! I was also very let down at the end not to learn more about the killer and his life. We were tempted throughout the book about his affliction and backround and then left hanging. I enjoy all of the autopsy and medical detail she puts in her books and was glad to see plenty of that still there. As others have stated, I also became bored with Kay's ""grief"". It got very old. I will continue to read her books, but hope she gets back to her usual style of writing."
4,Very Character Driven - Lots of Developement ! A Good Read.,"This latest ""edition"" of Kay Scarpetta's life was one of my favorites. It's a different kind of Scarpetta novel. This one is more about the characters with the ""mystery"" taking very much the back seat.Lucy is back and Marino and they're all sharing in the pain regarding Benton's death. Of all the books, this one moves the characters themselves further than any other (as with ""The Body Farm""). It's good to see that Kay is, indeed, capable of depression, that she is NOT a superwoman (no matter what SHE might think). I'd recommend this book to anyone - especially the fan who considers themselves part of Kay's extended family. I only wish Cornwell would publish more Scarepetta mysteries (I'm not thrilled with the ""Hornet's Nest"" bunch). Also, I think it'd be great if Lucy got her own book! These are all characters we've come to know and love - this book will further that. Regards to all. TurTleX"
4,"The true ""Scarpetta"" has stepped forward!","This book reminds me of Cornwell's earlier works in this series which I liked very much. Her last 3 books however have left a bad taste in my mouth. I was delighted to see the end of the ""Carrie Gretham"" influence and had much hope for this new book. It was a good book, but I think Patricia Cornwell is sick of the series and wants to move on. Why do writer's get so angry at the characters who made them famous? It's almost as if they are jealous. Obviously it's time to say goodby to Kay Scarpetta."
4,Enable to put it down - but left me with questions!,"The book was great and I love Kay and the rest of the group, but felt there were to many questions unanswered and why is Kay having a love affair with someone she just meet the day before!!"
4,This novel surpasses the last two books.,"The story starts with a bang. The characters are intense and the story carries great emotion throughout. The only downfall of the novel is the ending. I felt drained at the end and was craving more detail. Too many loose ends that I wanted taken tied together. The book ends rather quickly. This book is right up there with ""Potters Field"" by far the best novel of Cromwell's."
3,"interesting, yet depressing","i really enjoy patricia cornwell's books. i did get into black notice, but as it continued, i was depressed by the alcohol abuse so evident in these people's lives. marino drinks himself sick constantly and even on the job. no one can eat without 4 or 5 drinks and was quite disturbing. i didn't like the way it ended, but i was impressed, once again, with cornwell's thorough medical research."
1,"Call it a day, Patricia","This is garbage, just like POINT OF ORIGIN. I really liked the first few Scarpettas, but the series has run out of ideas. Yet another conspiracy in the workplace. Yet more scenes chez Kay with Marino and Lucy acting out the same cycle of angst. Please just stop it! If you want crime writing in which the characters keep developing, try Lawrence Block. Or if you want fresh crime writing from the female perspective, go to Minette Walters."
4,Excellently written--could not put down,"I disagree with the reviewers who are rather harsh in their opinions about this novel. It has all of the key ingredients to make it an excellent example of the best of its genre. As usual, Cornwell's writing is superb--the suspense is gripping, the action flows throughout the book, her descriptions are vivid, and her characters are real and complex. Unlike some of the reviewers, I find her well-fleshed out characters to be one of the strongest aspects of her writing. I enjoy seeing the continuing story of Kay Scarpetta's world come to life, and I enjoy seeing her interact with the characters that we have come to know through Cornwell's previous Scarpetta novels. I say Bravo to Cornwell, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an excellently-written murder/crime mystery!"
1,Not worth an autopsy,"Devoted Cornwell fans will hate this, but I don't care much. Patricia Cornwell writes thrillers to a formula and Black Notice reads as though she is writing without thinking. You know, been there done this so many times you don't have to think any more. Her clinical descriptions of a coroner's work are meticulous and for me, the best part of the book. However generally, Cornwell's use of language is thoroughly pedestrian, the descriptions of Dr Kay Scarpetta's grief over her lost lover overwrought, clumsily written and they slow down the action. By the end of the book I couldn't have cared less who the murderer was. My first Patricia Cornwell read - and my last. Not worth an autopsy."
1,"TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND TREES",Don't bother wasting your time with this book. Would have rated this a ZERO if possible and unless Patricia Cornwell dramatically improves this is certainly the last book I will be be purchasing written by this author.
1,a good book to speed read,One of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read.The only reason I finished reading it was in the hopes it would somehow become exciting. Much too descriptive when not necessary and some of the worst dialogue in print.Does this author actually talk to people or merely imagine what conversations might be?
2,I was very disappointed in this latest book.,This book was a disappointment after reading all the other books written by Ms. Cornwell. It was gloom and doom from start to finish. It was extremely depressing.
1,Yeesh...character development... PLEASE!,"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta mysteries. She and the rest of the gang started off as creative, interesting characters. They have ""evolved"" into just the opposite. What first intrigued me were the clinical details AND the characters. The settings and details are still of interest, but the characters have turned into one-dimensional static charicatures (Marino as overweight blue collar rough cop, Lucy as angry brainiac, etc.) There is no passion or life left in any of them. Alas...I fear I must bid farewell to Kay and Ms. Cornwell."
1,Disappointing,"Black Notice hints at the talent that Patricia Cornwell once displayed so effortlessly. The loup garou and Bray story lines promised greatness;rivals to Kay's throne from two different angles. I was looking forward to how Kay was going to solve the crime and deal with the professional challenge. Unfortunately, Cornwell revealed a startling lack of depth, and opted for the easy outs. She fell back to her old obsessions with Lucy and Marino; each becoming an increasingly disagreeable caricature of her/himself. And where did this sudden passion for Benton come from? That relationship always lacked warmth and compassion, nevermind passion. His death was just another convenient ending for her last Scarpetta book. This might be a good time for Cornwell to consider collaborating with another author who is a strong closer. She's petering out at third base and is unable to bring it home."
3,Better than her previous three books but could be better,"Although this was a lot better than her last three books inplaces it was very over-the-top and in-your-face. A bit of subtly insome areas would be nice!! It also reads a lot like a re-hash of her earlier books. More details about the killer would have been interesting. Think I'll stick to Dick Francis, Lillian Jackson Braun and Mercedes Lackey from now on!!!"
4,Once again Patricia has done it!,"I have read all of Patricia's books and this one lives up to the others in the Scarpeta series...I love watching the personalities of Kay, Lucy and Marino emerge. In this book we get to see a side of Kay and Lucy that has yet to be seen...the not-so-in-control side. I loved it...Patricia can't write them quickly enough to suit me!"
3,"Not great, not awful","This book was so-so. Actually, I am getting tired of the Kay Scarpetta character and especially of Marino (who is at his most unpleasant in this book). The stories in this series are all starting to sound the same."
2,Stop me before I finish this book,I was about half way through the book before I realized I had never read a book where each character was more unhappy than the previous one. Depressing and uneventful.
3,disappointed with the ending,I enjoy all the books that include Kay Scarpetta ..Black Notice was okay except for the ending which came in about the last 2 pages!! I would have liked to have seen a little more thought and supense in the ending to this one !! Hornets Nest and Southern Cross really left me hoping that Cornwell would bring back the Kay Scarpetta story line...Please keep her stories coming.
1,BORING!,"This is the first novel I read in this series. I had heard great things about the other novels. I've read my share of mysteries and psychological thrillers to know, when I'm reading an exiciting, can't put this book down, book. This book was anything, but exciting. It was slow, tedious and it kept putting me to sleep. I couldn't read more than four or five pages, before I had to put the book down, because my mind wasn't on it. If this book is so boring, it makes me wonder about the beggining of the series. It didn't bother me that she is a Medical Examiner. I'm used to watching a British mystery series on A&E about a pathologist. I've watched an autopsy, so none of that stuff mattered. There was little plot and no character development."
3,Weak plot... Could be better,"I am rather dissapointed with the weak plot. I still think Cornwell's earlier books are much better. In Black Notice, I don't quite understand why Bray & Anderson are brought in to conspire against Kay only to have Bray murdered later. Though they have messed up Kay's office, but the impact was not great. Also, Lucy's inclusion in this book is rather abrupt and out of place. Personally I still hope that Benton is alive some where living under a new identity. I think killing Benton was quite a waste. Ms Cornwell, if you are reading this review, I know you could do better. I will still be waiting for your new books and look forward to a much better plot.."
3,Time for a Change!,"I enjoyed Black Notice quite a bit, but I thought the ending was a bit lame and hurried . The Lucy chracter is becoming annoying and the new love interst (Talley) seems to come into focus much too fast, particularly after we have read many many pages of how upset and torn Kay is over losing Benton. Marino is starting to wear a bit thin. Maybe it is time to 'end' these chraacters, hopefully nicely, in future books."
3,"Good story until the end; flat, abrupt finish.","I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's ""Scarpetta"" books and loved them all, but this one was a bit off. The story kept my attention but Corwell has 2 main characters going way off track...Lucy & Marino need to be toned down a bit (I'm liking them less and less). I found myself coming to the end of the book and wondering how Cornwell was going to finish it in so few pages. The flat, unimaginative ending was my answer. A few extra pages for a better ending would have helped a lot. For the next one, I hope Cornwell brings Lucy and Marino back in line and has Kay back to her old self."
2,Predictable,"Even more unbelievable than the last. How has the earth managed to continue life as we know it before Kay and Lucy? PLEEEZ! Lucy is way too smart and pretty and computer-whizzed, blah blah blah. Oh and by the way, a lesbian. What is that about? I swore I wouldn't read another one of her books. She should have quit after the third - first three were very good. But they just get so outlandish and silly. Inane. Who cares? No more Cornwall for me - I swear."
2,Give us an worthy ending PLEASE !!!,"For the past couple of novels, Cornwell has left me disappointed on how she ends her books, no buildup at all, just the killer popping up out of nowhere to try and kill our heroine, Kay Scarpetta. This book has been the worst yet. With 10 pages to go I'm wondering, where is this going??? I was very disappointed with Black Notice and hope that Cornwell becomes a little more creative on how to wrap up her stories."
2,Continued Disappointment,"A new book starring Kay Scarpetta is guaranteed to cause me to pull out my checkbook immediately. Unfortunately, like many of the other reviewers, I found Black Notice a disappointment for a number of reasons. Wesley Benton was a moderating influence in previous stories, and I miss him greatly in the current book. Kay Scarpetta seems less organized, more bitter, and her angst colors the entire story. Lucy has become a distraction, rather than a contributor to the storyline, perhaps she should have been the one killed off! I would also agree with one of the other reviews that the ending of this book was hurried, poorly crafted and undeserving of the hundreds of pages of buildup."
1,Black Notice,"I WAS a big fan but I am not anymore. What happened to the ending? Did the publisher say you couldn't go over 470 pages? You could've left out the sex-that was totally unnessasary and you got alittle too technical on the medical-we're not reading a JAMA artical here. I wanted Loup-Garou to pick up Lucy's gun and end all their misery! I'm tried of the bickering, the overprotective aunt, the unwarrented sex, the omnipotent Dr Scarpetta. I hope in the ""Last Precinct"" it is the end and Kay either retires or gets killed. Patricia Cornwell needs to move on-she's pushed this character too far and me too."
1,Cashing in on past glory.,"A write must learn to end a series if they cannot keep up with strong and original plots. As a former admirer of Ms Cornwell, I am very disappointed in this book. The plot is so bizarre that it is difficult to take it seriously. There are too many references to a previous story-line (Benton) that is tiresome for those of us who have not read the Scarpetta series in chronological order, assuming that it was a recap of a previous book. The characters' flaws are so exaggerated that one wonders how sophisticated Scarpetta can even put up with a klutz like Marino, and why? Too many weird scenarios to count! Don't bother with this unless you are a die-hard fan of Scarpetta!"
3,Unsatisfied,"Although I've enjoyed each of the Patricia Cornwell novels I've read, I was disappointed at the ending of ""Black Notice."" I really like the character of Kay Scarpetta and the forensic science in each of novels which include her character. But, as others have stated, the forensic science in ""Black Notice"" seemed not to belong to the plot of the book.""Black Notice"" leaves one speculating about alot of unanswered questions and remaining mysteries. It leaves me to wonder if more is to come about the killers personna, the Chardonne family, and Agent Talley. To me, the story just ended in the way I expected, but I didn't exptect it to end once the killer was captured after trying to kill Dr. Scarpetta. I wanted to know more.This is the first book by Patricia Cornwell that has left me hanging. She is a very good author and I hope more of her books don't leave me feeling this way."
2,Only Okay,"Having worked with pathologists and ME's in my life. I find them interesting people. I also like to read fiction starring their profession, regardless as to how far out from reality they may be. It's fiction, right?But this offering from Cornwell isn't her best work. The whole book felt like a rehash of old sections of previous work. Was it worth the read? I suppose. I read most of it on a plane when my expectations were pretty low when it came to entertainment so it was fine for me. But the murderer wasn't very compelling and the regualr characters from the series seemed warmed over and predictable.I like Cornwell's work, but this felt more mailed in than well-thought. Don't run out to get this one, but if you find it in the used paperback bin, it's worth picking up for a rainy day."
2,"Unless you're into frustration, don't waste your time","You never realize how truly disappointing a book can be until you realize that there are approximatley fifty pages left and countless plot lines flapping in the breeze. Cornwell is a master storyteller. Unfortunately, Black Notice if incredibly similar to many of Dean Koontz's books in that the author tells a great story but has no clue how to tie everythign together and end the book. Like Koontz, Cornwell chooses to simply end without tying up many of the plot lines.My advice, don't waste your time."
3,Not Cornwell's best effort,"I am a huge Kay Scarpetta fan, but this book was in desperate need of an editor. There were several places where I had to flip back and reread, only to find that I was right the first time -- the book referred to facts that hadn't been proven or even discussed, things that hadn't happened, etc.The sad thing is, you have to read this book if you want her subsequent stuff to make any sense. But it really wasn't her best."
2,Excruciating Amount of Detail,I am normally a fan of Cornwell but this one is over the top. There is a LARGE amount of unnecessary detail in this book that makes you want to scream or at least keep turning the page until you get to a part that matters. The various plots jerk you around many times. The characters seem to say the same thing over and over again. I found the whole book frustrating to read and finished it in the hope that it would get better!
4,Disappointment or Good?,"In the tenth installment of the Kay Scarpetta series, the book was a disappointment to more of the action readers. As Kay took on a fragile emotion DEA officer. As the book becomes slow in the beginning and then it gradually gains into a thriller to a horror. So in the beginning if you can get through the slow reading into the middle were the plot unravels into a awesome book, then I recommend this book to you."
2,Full of holes and threads that peter out.,"The main story line doesn't even start until halfway through the book. There are some half-hearted attempts to tie everything together, but they don't really work.And what's with the niece and her relationship? Its as though Cornwall feels she has some obligation to include a dysfunctional lesbian relationship. WHY?? Its not as though the book's about homosexuality, and its not as though there is an integral character who just happens to be a lesbian. Its pointless. And Lucy is SO unsympathetic.I guess the worse part is that its not really a mystery. There are no clues that would allow the reader to figure anything out. Everything is resolved abruptly. Scarpetta doesn't figure anything out."
2,enough is enough,"I devoured the first Scarpetta books, but ever since Cause of Death, reading her books is continually disappointing. I mean come on a killer with excessive body hair, a warewolf? This is more like an X-File episode, and don't misunderstand me I love the X-Files. However, Scarpetta and Marino aren't Scully and Mulder! Also, like other reviewers have written I am little sick of the Lucy storyline.Quite honestly I think the best of Scarpetta is in the past. I am now on a new series by Dennis Lehane and it is absolutely fantastic! Try him instead."
2,A Steady Decline in Quality,"As a faithful Cornwell reader, I cannot help but be discouraged by this most recent literary nosedive. The book is poorly executed, characters not fully developed, and the story line lacks Cornwell's usual spine-tingling twists and turns -- and ultimately a satisfactory conclusion. Can this reader be saved? Yes...if Cornwell's upcoming book is worth my time...but guaranteed I'll wait for paperback."
3,Scarpetta needs a shrink,"While better than the last couple of Scarpetta novels, Black Notice does not get near the excitement and interest of the first couple of novels in the series. This character has gotten so strained, shrewish and neurotic that it is hard to identify with her feelings. I'm finding myself rooting for the bad guys - wishing both the good doctor and her selfish, obnoxious niece would get bumped off so Cornwell could get on to something more interesing.Also, while we understand that there are personal reasons why the FBI doesn't play a prominant place in her books anymore, am I the only one who feels that ATF is a step down?"
4,Lazy but still Brilliant!,"Compared to Post-Mortem, Black Notice is hurried and lazy. I gave it 4 stars because it is still excellent writing, nevertheless, and in my opinion even a bad Scarpetta novel is better than no novel at all. Of course I'll be reading the next..."
1,Far too introspective and lacking in mystery/suspense.,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and have truely enjoyed them...until this one. Kay Scarpetta spends fully two-thirds of the book in some kind of depression, absorbed with ""personal"" problems, and in a generally weakly written personal battle with another strong female character. This novel does neither woman any favors (nor does it do any favors to Patricia Cornwell). I would, frankly, guess that, unfortunately, production speed and ""reaping the rewards"" outweighed a substantial, well thought-out story."
2,"Better than ""Point of Origin"" -- but could it be worse?","Okay, Scarpetta, get over yourself. Sure, your life is tough, but whose isn't? At least you're not as cranky as you were in your last go-around. And tell me, when did you stop being a simple medical examiner and start saving the world from every lunatic out there? You might want to speak to your supervisors, 'cause they're putting a helluva lot on your shoulders. And do me a favor, will you? Slap Lucy for me. I know it must be hard to be so smart and find out your ex-lover is a pyschopath, but gimme a break. And if being gay in the '90s were as tough as she makes it out to be, I and a whole lot of other people would've slit their wrists long ago. Doesn't anyone in your family find joy in anything? Maybe this new young stud of yours can knock some sense into you. I hope so, 'cause your adventures are becoming just a little too depressing for words."
1,Ms. Cornwell tried but it doesn't work.,"Scarpetta was a truly fascinating character in the first book, but in ""Black Notice"", I believe she has become a self-absorbed excuse for a medical examiner-detective. And poor Marino! We knew he had problems and he was a sloppy dresser, etc., but Ms. Cornwell has completely stripped him of any likable traits. Lucy is a niece from Hell. And the storyline - unbelievable! If you don't know what to do with a character, kill her off! Please, Patricia, fire Scarpetta and end it!"
1,Very Disappointing.,"I typically enjoy Cornwell's Dr. Kay Scarpetta character, but for some reason this book was a far cry from the usual enjoyable read. Perhaps it was the complete nonsense masquerading as a story, or the unbelievably boring details that constituted the alleged plot. Whatever the reason, upon finally finishing this painful waste of time, I literally tossed the book into the garbage. I not only wish I had my $5+ back, but also the 5+ hours of my life, wasted on this joke of a book. Don't buy it."
2,Simile and Metaphor Dramatized,"For readers who want a well-crafted suspense story, skip this immature, feeble attempt at mystery. In this particular selection, Kay Scarpetta is an emotional cripple as testified to by the rampant adjectives that describe her delicate condition post her lover's death. This novel was grossly disappointing because of its consistent use of similes that test the patience of any well-read reader. Similes are sprinkled everywhere as if someone wrote a prescription for this novel that ordered a certain amount making the work silly, almost laughable. For a professional cornoner, the main character is both unprofessional, consistently a blithering woman and hangs onto a detective, in Marino, who was grabbed out of the 1950's with his wisecracking, emotional outbursts, and immature and unprofessional behavior of a New York City dectective. Sorry, but this novel is just plain a waste of any intelligent reader's time."
2,Black Notice,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books up to this point and have enjoyed them all. I did not, however, enjoy Black Notice. Rather than focusing on Dr. Scarpetta's work, there was WAY too much focus on who was out to get her. I want to read about the cases she solves, not all the black stuff that's going on in her own life. Some is OK, but not half the book. All of Cornwell's previous books were full of excitement, but Black Notice dragged on and on..."
2,Keeps getting darker,"Black Notice is the beginning of the dark period for Patricia Cornwell. Don't get me wrong, I love serial killer books, but her books keep getting darker and darker - depressing to read."
1,Preposterous,"This book is so awful, I don't even know where to start. If I could give it no stars, I would."
2,Poor effort,"This is a really poor effort by Patricial Cornwell. If this had been the first book of Cornwell's that I had read, I would have been likely to not read any more books of hers. Instead of a good mystery, we are offered extreme details of office politics and a slow moving plot, with a B-movie climax. The characters are extremely caricaturized here, and there also is a lot of self-righteousness and self-declared vulnerability on the part of Scarpetta. Overall, this one can be skipped."
1,DISAPPOINTING-NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HER FORMER BOOKS!,Patricia Cornwall has managed to turn this reader from one who could not wait for her next book to be released to one who is finished reading them. It may suprise her to learn that the sexual orientation of a person only clutters up a good story unless it has DIRECT bearing on the story being told. Lucy needs to get a life and grow up. I really miss the excitement of the her earlier books. I have found this nagging issue true of her last 3 novels.
1,Cornwell's Well has run dry,"I've read all Cornwell's books - but, man, this is the last one. I thought the other series she does was boring, but Black Notice is not only poorly written it is as dull as a desk job.Maybe Cornwell could take her foot off the pedal for a couple of years - despite lost earnings (and judging from her alter ego Scarpetta, Cornwell now has Dollar Signs in her eyes). She is definitely in need of some new ideas.Harping on about Benton is pointless: Benton was boring. Giving the reader details about Lucy's sex life is pointless: Lucy is boring. The only two interesting characters, Scarpetta and Marino she has now reduced to caricatures. Cornwell wants the reader to see Scarpetta as a brilliant, incisive investigator - but she comes off as a paranoid harpy - a bit the way her creator comes off in interviews.And Scarpetta as dominatrix with her suddenly irresistible appeal to younger (but apparently gay) men? Give me a break."
3,The Hardening of Two Women,"Cornwell has long been a favorite writer of mine. I have followed her career with a critical eye in a literary sense. I think an odd connection could be made with the progression of her character Kay Scarpetta and the progression of her media pictures on the back covers. Black Notice, which is undoubtedly Cornwell's most overtly hard, sad, bleak novel reflects the woman Cornwell has (at least aestheticly) become. To look at her pictures on earlier novels and then the one on Black Notice and then turning your eye to Kay Scarpetta in Black Notice vs. ealier novels..the women have both hardened...both on the same strange time line. Odd. The thing that most alrams me in Black Notice is the undeniable height that Kay's paranoia seems to have reached. As an intellectual woman, I want Kay to always be strong, able to be compsed concise and clear. I did enjoy this current offering but here's to hoping Kay makes a rebound mentally and emotionally in the novels to come."
3,Only average,"This is only an average piece of writing. It seems like her books are becoming more and more the same with a sudden resolution to the main plot in the last few pages with many loose ends to the subplots never resolved. And for the ""smart"" Dr. Scarpetta to make such a mistake to put her in danger just doesn't fit. My concentration was thrown off in the first few pages by the ATF being called the AFT--a typo that an editor should have caught! From that point on it seemed that there were many conversations that were out of sync and I never really got interested enough to find it as gripping as some of her earlier works. Take more time and care with the next one Ms. Cornwell. It's worth waiting longer between books to get a well written book!"
1,If you liked the original Scarpetta - stay well clear.,"Kay Scarpetta was one of the most interesting characters to enter the crime fiction genre. Intelligent, strong, independent and complex - she found herself in superbly written and engaging plots. Not any more. The Scarpetta series has been losing quality over the last few books - this is definitely a continuation of that trend. The characters that inhabit this book are cardboard cut outs of their former selves. There is no snappy dialog, no witty exchanges or brilliant, inspired detective work. Everything happens by the numbers - the only surprise this book delivers is whether you can bear to finish it. The characters, plots and climaxes are getting tired - do yourself a favour - steer clear of this one."
4,"In the best tradition of Cornwell, Scarpetta is great again!",Scarpetta solves another great one. The mix of emotions of the three main players is great. It was good to read the human side to all three. Where will she go next?
4,What has happened to Kay?,"Black Notice is definitely not one of Patricia Cornwell's better Kay Scarpetta books.In this book, Kay seems even more sorry for herself and mad at the world while dealing with the death of her lover; Lucy is embittered to the point of self destruction and Marino--well, Marino is just Marino.And in this book, the mystery was not as taut as in the previous novels. It begins satisfactorily when a dead and decaying body is found in the cargo hole of a ship, but the plot does not develop. In fact, it becomes rather convoluted, especially when Marino and Scarpetta go to Paris to help the Interpol. The story then evolves into a unbelievable mishmash with spectors of werewolves running amok through the streets of Richmond, Virginia.This is not to say that you should not read this book especially if you are a Kay Scarpetta fan. Despite its faults, it is an enjoyable read, and I recommend it because of that."
2,Audio Book Review,Disappointing. This was the first of the series that I read. I couldn't figure out the background so I never got into the story. The end wrapped up too quickly and then just dropped off.
3,Ending too short,"I have read all of Pat's books and up until now had problems with only the first one she chose a different character, I felt that the ending was put into one paragraph. I didn't think that would happen to this one, but everything happens in the last two pages. I like a little more explanation how it all fits together. There are so many great authors out there that at least leave you feeling satisfied after spending so much time with the book. I felt letdown when everything happened so fast. However, I will continue to read her books, maybe next time we could have a little better ending."
4,Cornwell back in top form,"This book and its predecessor Point of Origin were so much better than Cornwell's other recent titles. I loved the new romantic interest Talley, the Benton Wesley romance was really going nowhere fast. Hope the next one is even better."
3,Not her best effort...,"This was a book read from the CORBEL Book Club. As a reader of other Patricia Cornwell books I would have to say this is not her best; although, it did get better in the end (the beginning is slow to get started!) Some in our group who had not read other Cornwell books wanted Kay to get together with Marino (I DON'T THINK SO!) It made us feel as though we should have read the previous book to better understand what happened to Benton. The ending is good. Worth reading, but only when you have nothing better."
1,Terrible,"I am midway through Black Notice, the first book I have read by P. Cornwell and I cannot believe she has been a best selling author for how long? Would somebody email me at ajohnson@vvi.net and let me know what is so wonderful about these books? I am not a dodo, but this stinks.. Sorry"
3,"The content was great until the end, it left me lacking.","Normally I really like the Scarpetta series, but the last two have not been up to par. The ending of Black notice, was not up to her talents of writing. It was like she got tired of the story line and left it hanging. I'll try one more time before I quit the series."
2,"Please, less whining, more suspense","I read Black Notice yesterday, and was pretty frustrated. Thebook jacket talks about a transatlantic mystery, but why does it take3/4 of the book to get to France? Because we need to hear about how everyone is out to get Kay (again). I keep reading this series hoping that it will return to form (see Postmorten), but it's just getting more sloppy. At one point, Cornwell tells about how bacteria are breaking down the Container man's cell walls. Cell walls? Didn't she learn in high school that only plants have cell walls? One example of how she doesn't care enough to put enough thought and effort into a medical mystery plot. Doesn't she know that most serial killers are not freaks of nature, and the fact that they are generally perceived as just like you and me is much more scary than anything she has conjured up in a while?"
3,The foul language ruins this book.,"The foul language from Dr. Scarpetta and Marino absolutely ruins this book. The ending and the story line, while it sounded like Patricia Cornwell, was very disappointing. If she writes another book with this language content I will not read it. We are so bombarded today with this type of language in life and on T.V.,I read as an alternative to T.V. What a shame that now my reading material sounds worse than my television shows. Not your best Ms. Cornwell!"
4,great read but disappointing ending,"This is classic Scarpetta. I could hardly put it down. Some aspects are a bit farfetched, but it still is a great read . . until you get to the ending. For me, it was very unsatisfying."
1,"Oh, Please!!!","""Oh, Please!"" is what you'll say when the identity of the serial killer is revealed in the end. Hey, I thought this was supposed was supposed to be a crime-mystery-suspense title...should we recategorize BLACK NOTICE as another Danielle Steele??? Disappointed Cornwell Fan"
5,Once again Cornwell has written an outstanding murder story,"After the death of Benton in Point of Origin, I really didn't think there would be any more Scarpetta books! But Black Notice was a fantastic read! It has more in depth feeling that I have ever read in a Cornwell book. Kay, Marino and Lucy are off on another adventure that put me in tears at the end! It is unbelievable that Cornwell has written another great book. I can't wait for the next one!"
2,Give it a rest before writing the next Scarpetta installment,"After reading ""Black Notice,"" I felt I should call the NYPD to see if Cornwell is holding a gun to her editor's head to force publication of yet another whiny, confused, poorly edited and ultimately infuriating Scarpetta novel. Readers of series do enjoy growing with continuing characters, but just as in the one preceding this volume, ""old"" characters are plopped in without adequate introduction, thus mystifying new and less-devoted readers as to the details of previous actions and hence the effect on present motivations. Cornwell needs to take a long rest before tackling any more Scarpetta volumes!"
1,"Rambling, dreadful and sophomoric dribble","I've read all of the Kay Scarpetta novels. This one is my last. It rambles and wonders aimlessly in search of a plot line. Lucy and Marino have becoming very dark and very annoying. Read Kathy Reichs ""Death duJour"" for a better read."
1,Same old tired story line,"I was very disappointed in the newest Kay Scarpetta book. Same old story line, same old ending. Really is too bad, can't think of an author who's books I have always looked forward to reading."
1,Where Has All the Mystery Gone?,Predictable if you read her last 3 novels! We are first introducted to the sexual orientation of each character which really clutters up the plot. Was the plot of this novel to lead to a new life for Kay as a New Yorker who will be free to be herself! Notice how all the men in her books get killed off? It is ashame as her previous books were so good and she needs to learn to let Lucy grow up and that we do not care what the character's sexual orientation is as long as it's not necessary to the plot. Definately my last Patricia Cornwell book!
1,"this isn't writing, it's typing.","This is as maudlin a book as can be. Most of the time the characters are weeping: Kay cries when she gets a love note from the grave, Marino cries when Kay abuses him, Lucy cries when Kay cries which makes Jo cry over Lucy which makes Jo's parents cry over sin. Kay's stud muffin cries when Kay tells him not to love her, which makes her misty, which enrages Marino to tears. Benton doesn't cry because he's dead. And the werewolf doesn't cry or speak, which is too bad because he's the only interesting figure in the book. Other than that the coincidences are cukoo, Ms. Cornwell promoted a nice expense-paid trip for herself to Paris on the Concorde out of this and we have the usual Tom Clancy imitation of arcania covering up that which is really dreary detail. As her last book suggested, Ms. Cornwell is out of gas."
3,Always Scarpetta,I have always enjoyed the Scarpetta novels and have even re-read the series. While the story progression is as always I still enjoy the books
2,Nothing Happens in Most of Book,"This book just follows the life of Kay Scarpetta round and round, all her usual cronies and loves but I haven't heard about the murders since the very beginning. I've forgotten what the book is about. And some say there is 'blue' language. I'd call it 'black', and you must tolerate M___F__ing on every single page, times 3, the whole book, plus extra G-D-ing, blasphemy,etc, and the only thing I haven't had to endure is a sex scene--thank goodness. Not done yet, though. Am close to the end, and this book is so boring, it's hard to get there. I don't believe Cornwell even wrote this book. It doesn't have her flow because of the constant profanities, like jarring bumps in the road, and sounds as if it is written by a younger person who is used to including constant profanities in their own language. If she has a good story, why can't she just put it together and make it a relaxing read? It makes me wonder, 'Who wrote this?'"
2,Black Angst,"As a long-time mystery and Scarpetta/Cornwell fan, I bought Black Notice for entertainment. I wasn't prepared to be a captive voyeur to Scarpetta's angst and to wonder between the lines how much was projected from Cornwell's own psyche. The axiom is that successful writers write about what they know best. I wish she had stayed with fiction"
2,"Coroner, my life in print.","Very disappointing, unlike her other books, we spend the whole book in Kay's mind, who is the Diva here? I'm not interested in finding out that Kay is beautiful or has beautiful breasts, it's the autopsys and the mystery I miss. Plus, several unanswered questions, Why was the body put in the container? among others."
1,Bought this in the airport..should've stuck with USA Today,"The willing suspension of disbelief is something with which I'm fairly generous when it comes to recreational reading. But not here. Irrational dialogue and behavior. Scarpetta and Marino take turns acting as if they in need of a serious medication regimen. The plot lacks credibility. When will this series have a strong male character? The ending....well, was there really an ending or did the author get as tired writing this stuff as I did reading it? Don't bother."
3,"Not ""up to par""....","and I kept ""wanting"" it to get better throughout the book. I have read almost all of Patricia Cornwell's books and was really let down by Black Notice. It seemed that main character ""Kay Scarpetta"" never got over her past adventures from previous books......death of her lover, arguments with her niece, invasions of her computer system, break-ins at her house....etc. I felt like I was revisiting some of the other Cromwell books about Kay Scarpetta. I felt the story was too envolved with irrelevant situations that took away from a basically good story.....I hope Kay Scarpetta can get her self together in her next adventure....."
1,What was Patricia Cornwell thinking?,"I am still trying to figure this whole thing out. Was this book supposed to be about a crime-solving mystery or whiny soap opera with a mixture of Days of Our Lives and Melrose Place mixed in together? There was so much WHINING and relationship problems in this book that it drove me crazy! This book does not live up to all of the other Scarpetta novels at all. Here are my suggestions to Mrs. Cornwell- Kill that little annoying niece Lucy, have Mrs. Scarpetta stop whining and blabbering about poor Benton and stop making Marino look like a stupid drunk. I certainly hope ""The Last Precinct"" is better than this novel!"
1,What a story!,"The reader reviews are more entertaining and sometimes better written than the book.I got hung up on details like the license plate number on pp 132-133, and the proofreading was bad. But the book read like a cartoon, reminding me of A Man in Full. Southern cartoon characters. Plot? What plot? She got a free ride to France to have the villain handed to her? ""Oh yeah, we knew all about him?"" I was kind of hoping that Loveable Lucy would just empty her Glock at everyone during the hurry-up conclusion.I also think Talley went after Kay because he was attracted to Lucy and got nowhere. Sloppily written and hopefully not a window into the author's experiences."
1,Perfectly awful,"I have been a big fan of this series, but this book reads like a high school student trying to write a term paper due the next day. The backbiting and soap opera behavior of the characters and the plodding plots make this book extrememly tedious. The only enjoyable parts of the book were the ones dealing with the technical aspects of forensic work. Other descriptive words that come to mind are: depressing, sophmoric, lurching, disjointed and melodramatic. I do hope that this book was just a temporary lapse on the part of Ms. Cornwell and that she will produce something more palatable next time."
1,What Happen??,I have read every one on Ms. Cornwell's books and I have to say that she has always kept me enthralled. Not this time! Other then the characters being the same I would have to say that this novel was written by someone else. It is possible that she needs to find another cast of characters.
2,Not up to par,"After reading 250 pages or so I was thinking to myself, ""this is really slow. Everything I've read so far could be summed up in a paragraph or two."" I was expecting something really exciting to happen but as I got to within a few pages of the end I realized I had been let down. It seemed P.C. wanted to end the book in a hurry and just let it go. I prefer Jeffrey Deaver's books. You know with his books you're in for a surprise."
2,I hope the First is the Worst,"This is the first time a have read a Cornwell novel. I hope my first time reading her is my worst experience with her novels because I will soon embark on reading three more of her novels.The sub-plots in this work, if they can even be considered sub-plots, add virtually nothing to the story line. And the addition of segments about Ms Scarpettas dead former lover, also add absolutely nothing more than adding pages. In reality these are all put in to thicken the book. If Ms Cornwell were to be honest with us, she woud admit that this ""novel"" could have been easily reduced to a short story.The ending is extremely disappointing. We learn nothing of what makes the killer tick. I would suggest that you selct any other novel to read. Don't waste your time on this one. Come to think of it, I should have rated this book as one star."
4,Black Notice,"Contrary to some other reviews, I thought the book was very good. I like how Ms. Cornwell keeps you abreast of the lives of Dr. Scarpetta, Marino and Lucy. I feel like I know these people. All her books give very good insight as to how a medical examiner works (sometimes) side by side with the police in trying to discover clues that will help to apprehend the murderer. I highly recommend reading this book."
3,Loved the book ... NOT the language,I have always been a Patricia Cornwell fan. I wait anxiously for her next book to come out and am one of the first in line to purchase either the book or the audio tape. After reading or listening to her books I pass them on to my mother ... for she too is a big fan of Patricia's books. I puchased the audio tape and had it in my tape player before I even started the car for home. I was appaled at the language used in this book. The context of the storyline (which I truly enjoyed) would not have been altered a bit if the profound language would have been left out. I have not. nor will I. pass this on to my mother and I have told her why. I have read everyone of Patricia's books but will think twice before purchasing her next one. Many of my friends and co-workers who are big fans of hers feel the same way. A little profanity is acceptable but this was way way out of line.
1,Empty Promises,"Hi, this is my first review ever and I felt I need to write one to do justice on spending my time reading the Black Notice - to make something fruitful outta it. This is also my first Patricia Cornwell book read.Overall, I felt that more suspense can be built into catching this ""werewolf"" than to circle around sub-plots which seems to make the book tiresome. When I was onto page 255, I almost gave up as our Dr Kay wasn't making much progess in identifying this ""werewolf"". The remaining of the pages happened in such a split second, that does not gives me the pleasure of anticipation and excitment (if any, was worn up at page 255). The climax of the book. that is, when the werewolf was capture - 2 to 3 pages? - didn't build up enough suspense to make my money worth..."
3,Entertaining...,"I've read about 3 or 4 books, including ""Black Notice"" recently. I'm quite impressed however, everytime I read her books, why is it that Lucy is always some kind of a troubled child. I agree with one of the readers, she's a spoiled brat... Plus I've noticed that to make the story long, there's always the personal problem involved... Oh well, this is only a book but I hope on your next project, it will focus more to the subject of the book, a little bit about her life is okay..."
1,I give up!,"I have been a fan of the Scarpetta novels for years and have read every one. Unfortunately, this one will probably be my last. I couldn't even fight my way through this one. I read over 100 pages of this thing, and nothing happened. I think this character has run its course. It's time to do something else."
3,Not Cornwell's best work.,Maybe I have read one too many of Cornwell's books but I did not find Black Notice as compelling as previous Cornwell titles. Kay Scarpetta too self absorbed and parts of this book were far too unbelievable. The story line and characters have lost some of their original appeal.
2,Not as good as her usual,"I have read almost all of Cornwall's book's and found this one to not be very exciting. The depressing mood and the lack of any exciting events made me want to stop reading it several times. However, I finished it only to be extremely irritated by the ending. Maybe the next one will be back to Cornwall's usual standards."
3,Same old story,I had been anticipating this book for months. It starts outgood but the ending is always the same. It feels like she runs out oftime and has 3 pages to end the book. The language is somewhat foul. The pro-gay themes are getting excessive. Perhaps the writer should separate her issues from her books. When Scarpetta comes out of the closet it will be the end of the story line.
4,Left me neutral,"I've been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for years and waited anxiously for this book to arrive. Unlike her previous Kay Scarpetta stories however, this one never really grabbed my interest and too many questions were left unanswered. Why was Bray out to do her in, how did the ""werewolf"" happen upon the Inspector. Detective Marino and Lucy were such peripheral characters in this story that I was disappointed. Everyone knows Lucy is an ace with computers. She could have taken care of the e-mail bug post-haste, but no she's relegated to shooting bad guys in Florida. I finished the book but would have a hard time giving it any more than 4 stars."
1,"Too predictable, unstimulating.","I was glad to see the return of the Kay Scarpetta character, but the story never really grabbed me at all and I knew the guy was at the door way before she did. I stuck it out to the end hoping there would be some twist, but nothing. I have read all of her books and sorry to say, I am ready to move on. I felt like Patricia Cornwell wrote the story without her heart and soul."
3,There have been better Scarpetta books,"Yes I enjoyed this one and read it within a day or two of picking it up from the bookstore, but there is something missing. I had a hard time getting into this series. I bought one, made myself read it and then didn't read another until Potter's Field which made me go back and read all the ones I'd missed. I couldn't believe Benton was murdered last time and I feel that Kay should be able to deal with the situation in a better manner than she has been doing. I guess I don't want my fiction to mirror reality quite so closely. Don't deal lightly with tragedies, but don't dwell on them either. Deal with it and then get on with life - it doesn't wait for you.Any way - read this so you have the background to enjoy the next one in the series which I hope will return to better days and more intrigue."
3,Back to basics...the author still has an ax to grind.,"After Ms. Cornwell's previous two books, Black Notice was at least an escape to her best protagonist, Kay Scarpetta. Ms. Cornwell is at her best with her medical knowledge and interesting twists on the ""ghastly murder"" themes. However, in her previous two novels, she has had a bitter and negative approach, and her characters didn't seem to come alive. In Black Notice, she is somewhat back to form, but the negativity still comes through in her treatment of characters. I always look forward to her books, but hope she gets her own life better under control. It appears to me that the author is militantly feminist, and quite probably, lesbian. I really don't care, but she needs to be careful not to let her own prejudices show through. Kay Scarpetta has the makings of a fascinating, multi-faceted character, whom the reader might like to get to know...if the author didn't keep antagonizing everyone."
4,Another Kay Masterpiece,"Once again, Patricia Cornwell has released a riveting, on the edge of your seat mystery. In her latest work, Black Notice, she focused more on the private lives of the characters instead of just the murder case. This is a great new tactic because every case is basically the same, and it is the conflicts between Kay and the people around her that bring the reader back for more. Personally, I can not wait to see her next Kay installment in the bookstores. It is sure to be a thriller just like all of the rest."
1,Pass this one by,"Unfortunately for Patricia Cornwell fans, she appears to have run out of fresh ideas for plots involving Kay Scarpetta. This time it seems plausible that Cornwell's publisher wanted a book by a certain date so she delivered. Too bad, because the plot is poor, geographic details are inaccurate, character development is non-existant, and the dialogue is frenetic. For anyone who has grown to care about Kay, Lucy and Marino and who cried at Benton's demise, do yourself a favor: pass on Black Notice."
1,Disappointment,"I was very excited to start reading Black Notice, but as once I started I was very disappointed with it. I usually love all of Patricia Cornwell's books. This book had potential to be a great book but it went down hill with the more you read. The ended was a major disappointment."
1,Tired material,It seems as if the author has gotten lazy over the last few Scarpetta books. The characters have become really annoying. This book was not enjoyable. Disappointing since the early books were so good.
1,It appears that Cornwell has lost a fine editor.,"This book is so loosely written, so disjointed, so poorly edited for both grammar and flow, with conversational lines that start nowhere and end in exactly the same place, one has to wonder if Cornwell owes the higher quality of her previous work to an outstanding editor."
3,Typical Cornwell book,"This book is OK...I've read all of hers, and they are tending to become much the same...In this one, her government office uses AOL as an email client...that is ridiculous...would never happen..."
3,Better than the reviews led me to believe,"I have read all of the Scarpetta series and many other books that Cornwell has written. I am a writer of murder mysteries myself and hope that I have her talent. Prior to buying 'Black Notice' I thought hard about it as I was a bit hesistant based on the reviews of other customers. Now after having read it twice I believe that yes there was some deterioration of the plot, but it seemed only a momentary flicker before she got right back on track. I won't disclose the ending, but contrary to what I had been led to think by other readers, it does come to a believable and complete conclusion. Yes some of her earlier books in this series were better, but the Scarpetta character as well as Lucy are true to form."
1,What's the Name of this Book Again?,I bought the audio version of this book - I'm 3 tapes down - and I keep asking myself if I've already read it. I came to Amazon.com to make sure this was Patricia Cornwell's latest book. Nothing in Black Notice is very original. It's all a repeat of Postmortem and Body of Evidence. Very disappointing.
2,A tale of too many story lines,"As an avid Scarpetta reader, I was disappointed with Black Notice. There were too many subplots with the characters, and I found that the main plot of the book (i.e., trailing the ""werewolf"") was virtually put aside until the midpoint of the book. The climax of the book was anticlimatic, and ill-contrived. Please bring back the strong, tough Scarpetta that we all love!"
2,Dissapointing,"I was pretty disappointed with this novel especially since it was so anticipated. I felt that Kay was very whiney, Lucy is going out of control and Marino is just unbelievable. I also did not get even a tiny thrill of fear throughout the entire book. I hope her next book is more along the lines of the classic Kay Scarpetta that I have come to enjoy."
2,Could be worse,"What starts out as a reasonably intriguing mystery spins out of control over the final hundred pages or so, into a ridiculous ending. Lucy (AKA supergirl) & her new gal G.I. Jo are trying to shut down a gun-smuggling operation down in Florida & somehow it's all connected to the case back in VA. Isn't that amazing... Then we have Scarpetta and Marino flying off to Paris to meet w/ an Interpol agent & only Scarpetta can help Interpol solve their case. Naturally the VA case is related to these cases in France. Oh I particularly love the afternoon randevú w/ a man almost 1/2 her age while in Paris (NOT).Glad I got the book from the local library."
2,Disappointing,"I've always loved the Scarpetta books, but if this had been the first one I wouldn't have read more. It's not just that the personal interaction seems to take precedence over the actual crime, or that the mood is horribly dark. It's that none of the plots in this are very well developed. Although there's a lot of time spent on the plot against Kay and her friend Marino, the motivation behind the plot wasn't very believable, at least to me. The introduction of Kay's new boyfriend gave that part of the book the tone of a bodice-ripper starring Fabio. And even the crime itself was easily solved with tips from the Kay's French counterpart - almost a deus ex machina solution. I will try to avoid reading Cornwell's next book."
4,A DOOZY,"Cornwell's name on the cover virtually gaurantees both instant bestseller status and enthusiastic raves from the reviewers, and not without good reason; her narrative is convincing and chilling."
3,BETTER THAN SOME OF HER OTHERS!!!!!,"This book is better than some of the others in this series. A dead man's body leads Dr. Scarpetta on a dangerous mission. How did he get in the container? What are the hairs from? Could it be something that comes out when the moon is full? Strange twist in this one. I liked it better because Benson is gone. Lucy is still the SUPERWOMAN of all time but she is not in this one as much. As usual Pete Marino is great. I really like him better than anyone else in in the series. On page 83, (paperback) he has mustard on his shirt, his tie is to short and he has on two different color socks. Marino has be demoted by the new Ass't. Chief, a lady named Bray. This is the other plot going on in the story. Bray is after Marino and Scarpetta. Will she get either one? Have to read to find out. I lilked this plot in the book better than the ""hairy man"" plot. All in all it was fair. Not as good as her very early books."
4,Wonderful as Usual!!!!,I enjoyed every minute of this book! It is one of those you just can't put down. I encourage everybody to read this and all of her books!
2,Very disappointing for one of my favorite authors.,"I have read everything Patricia Cornwell has written. This starts out very intriguing and leads up to a wonderful climax and then falls ""flat"". More of a wham-bam-no-thank-you ending. In comparison with her previous writings, this books falls very shot of her wonderful skill. It does not show here. Kay Scarpetta is mean and cold. Lucy has turned into some hard-core maniac and the reasoning is NOT believeable. It is time to let go of personal anger and bring back the characters that she is capable of writing about. Very disappointed, but will keep trying her again."
2,get a life!!,"ms cornwell's stories are interesting, but lately dr scarpetta has become the most whinny, self centered character to hit the literary pages in some time. as for the ending it seemed (and not for the first time) that ms cornewll got tired of writing and just hurried the ending and left me at least wanting more or at least some answeres to the questions she posed in the book. overall another disappointment in the series."
3,Narrator makes Marino sound like Rocky looking for Adrian!,"After reading the book, I listened to the abridged version of the audio tape. I thought the book w as fine, but the audio tape was horrible. That narrator has got to go...she has one accent..and it isn't a very good southern one, and I was embarrassed for her by her portrayal of Marino. Don't bother...stick with the book."
1,Not what I wanted,"I love Patricia Cornwell. I've written in to loudly and clearly praise her Winter Table book when everyone else hated it. However, this book was terrible. I was so enthusiastic when I got it and couldn't wait to read it. But, it had no point...it just seemed to fly around from place to place and the so-called feelings were just dumb. She was up, she was down, she was all over the place and I was throughly disapointed. Please, Patricia, get back to your usual books. The great ones!"
1,What a disappointment!,"Stay away from this one. It's hard to be specific about thisbook's many deficiencies without giving away plot twists, but: Can'tCornwell invent a believable criminal any longer? Motivation and forensic-pathology procedures are given short shrift; Scarpetta herself goes two-dimensional. This is most manifest in the pallid, watery descriptions of Kay's heterosexual activity. Coded and overt lesbianism, however, luridly and lovingly takes center stage. Put it this way: If this were the first Kay Scarpetta mystery you picked up, you'd never pick up another one."
2,Corpses Aren't the Only Folks Who Need to Chill,"Apparently Patricia Cornwell has never met a character she actually liked. Even her protagonists are irrasible and paranoid to the point that they can't get along with each other for more than five minutes without blowing up, storming out or otherwise behaving like emotionally stunted two-year-olds. It's unusual to enjoy a mystery and its solution without experiencing the slightest affinity for the people involved, but that's the way I feel reading Cornwell's books. Given the choice of hanging out with the good doctor, Superniece, and their friends or the unfortunate victims in the morgue, I'd choose the latter; at least they know how to stay calm and cool under pressure."
3,Average compared to her previous excellent work,"I have bought everyone of Cornwell's books and they have kept me glued to the pages. Black Notice however, is not one of her better books. It was a good story but Cornwell has set such a high standard, that I expect all her books to be outstanding and I am afraid this one was not. I do not regret buying this book, but maybe it is time for Cornwell to write a new series and let Kay Scarpetta rest in peace."
2,Reaching for storylines,"I love the Kay Scarpetta novels, and have read all of them. The last few (this one included) seem to be reaching for storylines. There's always a ""bad guy"", other than the murderer the heroine is after. Someone within Scarpetta's office or within the police department who's out to get her. And all of these ""bad guys"" are so jealous of the world-famous Dr. Scarpetta. Come on! These story lines have little or nothing to do with the main theme of the book and really detract from the story. I, for one, preferred the earlier Scarpetta novels."
2,Scarpetta getting unbelievable...,"Unfortunately I didn't happen to read the reviews of this book before reading it, otherwise I might have thought twice about it. This was my first disappointment with one of Patricia Cornwell's books. I probably would have read the book regardless, since I like the character. Unfortunately, however, I will now wait and read the reviews of the next book before I spend my time on it. Most of the book was as an enjoyable read, however I was extremely disappointed in the ending of the book. The end seemed completely out of character for Dr. Scarpetta and totally unbelievable. My first thought was that it was a rush job in order to get it to press. Actually, I'm hoping that is the case as there didn't seem to be much thought or originality in the finale. If this is a sign of things to come, then I'll regretfully have to pass on the future books."
3,I am glad I bought a used version for 20 bucks,"Kay and Marino are getting too tedious for words.I bought the unabridged audio version. I rather liked the main plot, it was entertaining, but.....I am beginning to want to slap Marino..he is becoming so obnoxious I could do without him. And as for Kay Scarpetta..get a grip! She is busy feeling sorry for herself for half of the book! Benton is dead..move on! And for the life of me, I can not understand what Jay Tolley saw in her! She is busy being either rude or sappy when they are together. Cornwell is going to lose her following if the next books are of the same quality. (And I used to love all of her stuff.)Now I will only buy used versions..just in case."
3,Not the best of the Scarpetta series,"While I love Patricia Cornwall's writing, this was my least favorite of them all. Considering how brilliant the other books were, this one was still worth reading, but not up to par with her previous works. Ms. Cornwall seemed to take a different vein with this work, but I prefer her previous stategy. Scarpetta just seemed a bit out of character in this book (i.e. having the impromptu fling with the young French man just didn't seem like her at all). All in all, worth reading because even a so-so book by Patricia Cornwall is still a good read, I just expected her usual top of line story."
1,Where Have Cornwell and Scarpetta Gone?,"Patricia Cornwell has been one of my favorite authors in recent years, so when a friend praised Black Notice as vintage Cornwell, I bought it immediately. However, I struggled to get through it - not vintage Cornwell at all. The characters we have come to know so well seemed to have no redeeming qualities and that includes Kay! There was an overall negativity about this whole book with heavy focus on Benton's death. The average reader does not want to wade through technical medical terms, gore and very angry and filthy dialogue. A grieving Kay would not jump into bed having known the guy for a day! Lucy just can't be trigger happpy and out for revenge. And Marino just can't have deteriorated to the degree she has painted him. He, however, was the only one with any common sense and foresight. The plot was a stretch - is she running out of content material? So, no more Cornwell for me! I see there's are new one out in July but it won't land on my bookshelf!"
3,An interesting story,"The author has developed an interesting story, but it suffers from the effects of trying to wind three plots together - the activities of the main villain, the problems/politics within a police agency, and the activities and troubles of the main character's niece. There are some technical errors that could be overlooked, but a lot of loose ends. Overall, an interesting story."
1,"Awful,far fetched,dull and boring","Ms. Cornwell needs to put her Dr. Scarpetta books to rest. They have become so predictable. Could anyone not figure out the ending? Her new love is so hard to believe that it's ridiculous,and we are constantly being assaulted by Marino's foul mouth and stupid behaviour.When will Ms. Cornwell come up with an origional story? She's rehashing the same old thing over and over. Thankfully I got this book out of the library and didn't waste my money."
1,What has happened to Kay Scarpetta?,"I am an avid Patricia Cornwell reader but my interest dims with each new book. True fans will be very disappointed by this latest Kay Scarpetta installment. This book is poorly written, the dialogue is wooden and trite, the characters don't have nearly the depth she usually provides, and the new love interest is a total fraud, not Kay's type at all (what the heck was wrong with Benton? That was a great storyline!). I also could have done without the romance novel scenes, and Ms. Cornwell shouldn't try to write them - not her forte! Even her villains are boring and predictable now, and her forensic pathology research and descriptions are weak. ""Black Notice"" was clearly written to satisfy a book contract and doesn't even come close to the quality of her early work. Ms. Cornwell should re-read ""Postmortem"" and revisit the writer she used to be before she attempts the next one."
1,All of Cornwell's plots read the same,"I think I've read all of her books, but I am not sure. When I read this one I was struck by an overwhelming sense of deja vu -- I've read this before. Then I pulled up a list of Cornwell's books and realized that in spite of the fact that I've read them all, I couldn't tell them apart. The plot are entirely indistinguishable."
1,What are you thinking?,This is a horrible book and a waste of lifespan; yours and the author's. Do not waste your time. Go watch Mexican soap operas or something.
1,Cornwell hasn't produced a decent book since 1995.,"Dull, unimaginative, ""been-there-done-that,"" crank 'em out drivel. I can't read another one."
5,Kay Scarpetta must go on!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book made me cry at times and angry too, but I still want more of Dr. Scarpetta and the rest of the gang! This is a non-stop read! Her best yet! It will keep you up late and dragging into work the next day! But I miss Benton with her as well!"
3,Fast read but not as good as her earlier works.,"This book started out well, but as the plot continued, it became increasingly disorganized. There are several unfinished plots in this one. points to Chuck and Diane Bray but never really addresses this problem. Also, why does Lucy always end up looking like an inhuman machine? She is female, but Cornwell can never portray her as having any female characteristics. Lucy's problems are always left up in the air and never resolved, and let's face it she needs some serious help pyschologically. Finally, I haven't liked the way Cornwell has just abruptly ended her last several books. There is no closure to the plot...It was a good book until the last 2 chapters"
3,great read for the first 340 pages - the last 28 were weak,"This book picks up in the continuing saga of Kay Scarpetta and doesn't disappoint the reader with it's unusual story line. However, this reader was less than pleased with the conclusion - it left much to the imagination which we can only hope will be explained and continued tn the next effort by Cornwell. It almost seemed that she (Cornwell) was trying to meet a deadline, thus, cutting out a great deal of what would have made this a much more enjoyable read. Please Patricia, clear up all the loose ends next time!"
5,Simply Excellent!!,"I first encountered Jane Kelly on cassette. I couldn't stop playing the tape-it wore out! I then purchased 2 copies of the CD; 1 for the car and the other for home. My two kids (one who's into Rap and the other who's into Alternative Rock) LOVED it too - which was highly unusual - that we all love the same music!) even memorized the clever and creative lyrics! Just a fun, uplifting, joyous celebration of life. The band members are superb. Where the heck did Jane Kelly go?? Anybody know what's up with her career?? This couldn't be it - could it??? Buy this one if you're into treating your heart to some loving sounds."
4,Well worth a listen.,"I was fortunate enough to see Jane Kelly Williams open the show at a Grey Eye Glances concert at the Tin Angel in Philadelphia. Between sets, Jane's drummer sat next to me in the small venue and I told him, ""You guys have a nice sound."" And that's certainly the case. ""Tapping the Wheel"" is a delightful album all the way through, from the optimistic ""Horizons"" to the weary and wistful ""Carry Him."" Jane's lilting voice and down-to-earth lyrics set up an interesting counterbalance to one another. Take a listen, and you'll find yourself ""tapping the wheel,"" too."
5,A great value,These earings are well worth the price! The earings are very nice and a great value and I do not feel overly concerned about wearing them daily. I now have a favorite pair of earings!
2,Not like the picture,"THis product looked nothing like the picture. It was very small and did not sparkle. I had to purchase other earrings, instead."
1,Superficial,"Whatever happened to the glory days of French cinema like Truffaut, Godard etc, now replaced by unimaginative ""realists"" of the type represented in this movie. From the cardboard cutout characters to the inane ""plot"" this is a film that only teenage girls of 17 and a half could empathize with. This film doesn't tell you anything you haven't seen before in the ""coming of age"" category...oh, the confusion, the tears, the lousy sex, the intolerant parents etc etc. The only redeeming feature is the actresses who do a brave job with the atrocious screenplay."
3,One of the better French films I've seen,"This is one of the better films I,ve seen from France. Romance was a good film with awful dialog, this films' dialog was some what better. The story was good although tragic. As with all French films, I think there is a problem in the translation and the dialog always sounds so stupid, at least in subtitles. Maybe dubbed versions are better, I don,t know as I haven't checked them out. This film is worth a look, as it has a good storyline and not as artsy as you might think.charlie67@earthlink.net"
3,"Lacking Quality, not speed","Yngwie is the master of neo-classical driven rock. However, hehas a familiar trend of releasing albums full of cheesy songs. Thisrecord is no exception!In the past, Yngwie has released great material. Check out Warto End All Wars, Alchemy, and Anthology...This record could have been his best. His riffs are heavier than ever and the sound if great. He needs to hook up with a great front man if he wishes to be a song driven artist. He is not agreat lyricist, even though he thinks he is.Two tracks, back to back, start with same drum fill. That is just one more example of predictable Yngwie. He plays the same stuff over, and over.He is the best at what he does though! Who can argue."
5,Flying Fingers of Glory!,Yngwie will knock you off of your seat. This album will knock you off this world. Put the 2 together and hold on!
1,"Same old crap, only difference is the album cover","Why on earth this Neo-classical `play as fast as I can' stuff is still ever popular beggars belief. Yngwie Malmsteen seems to be stuck in a time zone, were it is okay to play the same solos, the same riffs and rhythms over and over and over again, album after album. Surely he must be getting bored with his own playing by now? You could imagine the outcry if Eddie Van Halen re-leased eruption over and over again, or if even Vinnie Moore, Steve Vai of Greg Howe played the same solos over and over again, but this is the difference with these guitarists in that they experiment and move with the times. As for the songs on this album, they are once again weaker than weak. I think it is time Yngwie either learnt some new scales and changed his playing or quit, because I personally think his music nowadays is duller than dull."
1,Malmsteen once again unleashes bordom,"Malmsteen has once again released the same record 23 years in succession. For some of these 5 star reviewers all I can say is 'get a life'. Malmsteen is the most boring, repetitive dullest guitar player ever and if you are too dumb to see that, then go ahead, waste your money and buy this record. For the more educated out there, avoid!"
1,Same old Yngwie....,"I agree with everyone who gave this one star. Yngwie just gets so tiresome. I respect his speed, but man, USE A DIFFERENT IDEA ONCE IN A WHILE!! Same arpeggiated choruses, same harmonic minor solos, same beats. And I haven't even heard this album, I'm just assuming that's what it sounds like based on the last 20 years of his material. I guess you can't teach an old dog (with a big a** gut) new tricks. Try Michael Romeo from Symphony X or John Petrucci from Dream Theater, who both have excellent solo releases (Petrucci under his own name and also with the instrumental group Liquid Tension Experiment)."
2,"Something seems wrong here, like drinking stout in the sun","Have you ever tried to like a recording but finally have to just give up and admit you don't? It's hard to put my finger on exactly what I don't like: there is a freewheeling energy derived from a mix of rock, blue grass, and Zydeco. The songs are generally up-tempo and the band, if not always tight, is spirited.But after one last listen, the more I realize I'll never play this CD again. I don't have a high tolerance for fiddle or zydeco to begin with, so what others might dub infectious, I find irritating, especially when the fiddle is sawing away and the band seems to be going through the motions.Something seems wrong here,like drinking stout in the sun. At best one might get away with slipping a track or two on a compilation CD."
1,Major Disappointment,Daniel O'Donnell should stick to the Irish songs and country western songs he does quite well. He does a poor job on most of the songs on this CD and does not have the vocal range to sing the songs like they were originally recorded and the way we remember them.
4,no title,"Well, he's back on track here, with a well-paced and interesting story set in Cambridge, as was ""The Masters"". Snow seems so at home there and writes marvelously of the Cambridge Fellows, most of whom appeared in the earlier book. I thought it a good choice to make Howard, the man accused of faking a photograph to prove his science, such a thoroughly unlikeable person, and thereby showing us a purer justice than if he had been someone whose company we enjoyed. The scales of Justice are blind, or should be so. I love reading about the ways and intrigues of Cambridge."
2,bulky,"small opening in the eyepiece makes the use of this counterproductive, as your eye needs to actually get closer to the piece. If you wear eyeglasses, like I do, forgeddaboutit!"
2,you probably don't want to buy this,"First off the photo listed here on amazon is not accurate of product. I went back and forth on whether or not I liked the adapter/magnifier. Ultimately I don't use it anymore, you lose a small percentage of the view finder with the adapter on it, and considering that most dSLRs (i use d200) are 95% of the actual sensor/image area to begin with, losing another 5% is not how I want to be shooting."
3,Limited value,Maybe because I wear glasses the magnification is very limited to be of much value. I can only say it is better than nothing.
3,Nikon DK-21M Eyepeice,Unit is OK. But it needs some type of cup that will keep stray light out of the users eyes
1,Nikon Eyepeice NOT for Canon Xti,I purchased this magnifying eyepiece for use with my Canon based on other user suggestions. Contrary to what others have said -- the eyepiece does not fit correctly on the XTi - it sits slightly too low and obscures view with an almost unnoticeable magnification. The magnification is not sufficient enough to justify purchase IMO. I also tried using it in conjunction with my eyepiece extender from canon to make up for the lose of magnification - bad idea.
5,Excellent text for study.,"This is an excellent reader for study of the classics or the Bible. The text is very clear, and there are titles in Latin for comparison of the Greek and Latin. I love it since I study both languages.The surviving Greek papyri predate the Hebrew-Aramaic. This version includes the minor differences between the codices, and it's in a handy size.I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
5,18 Visions can't get better than this!!!,"My friend recently introduced me to this band, all i have to say is that i am hooked on them. This album is really great, the title does fit with the music and the lyrics, it all just comes together. I especially love the way they can be really hard and then just mellow out, i love that in a band!! As if that wasn't enough, they are all really hot and sensitive (at times)"
5,FANTASTIC!,"As I began this book in my ninth grade English class I though to myself ""Uhhhh, another boring art book."" As I read further I began to relate to the problems in he paiting more and more. I loved the way Susan Vreeland uses the painting as the proaganist of the story! I recomend this book to anyone who is in search of a diffent yet expressive novel!"
2,Interest decresing towards the end,"I noticed that the book lost interest and flow after a couple of chapters. To be honest, the last chapter was so boring that I did not even finish it. I enjoyed the first 5 chapters, though.I guess it was very clear to me how everyting was tied together, exept for a couple of chapters."
4,Unusual,"Unusual story traces a suspected Vermeer painting back through time into the hands of each of it's owners until you find out whether it actually is the real item. Of course, if you've read some of the other reviews the secret is out, unfortunately because that spoils the mystery of it."
2,Reads like someone's senior English project,"Very disappointing book. The story never resolves with the introductory chapter, which seemed to be the most logical and interesting step to take. It's nothing but a collection of flat short stories, each predictable and hurried. Only one or twice did I care what happened to anyone, as the writing style rushed along -- I understood that the painting was supposed to be the ""main character,"" but I found myself not empathizing with why the human characters would risk so much for this object. I suspect that the movie ""The Red Violin"" did a better job accomplishing what this author set out to do."
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps I wanted to find some of the delight I feel when I look at a Vermeer painting or reproduction of one. But instead I found a technically accomplished work which overall relentlessly focussed on the 'brutal facts of life', which has so little to do with the qualities of love, beauty, light and mysterious intimacy which I find in Vermeer's work. A depressing and disappointing read."
1,&#65533;Ne malorum memineris&#65533;,"""Ne malorum memineris""""Remember no wrongs""One of the thinly drawn characters of this unsatisfying book embroiders this into her little bit of cloth. And if the reader heeds this advice, this book will soon be put out of mind."
3,3.5 stars,"I liked the way this book felt in the hand while reading it.It's printed on fine quality paper, and has a beautiful cover,which makes it inviting to want to read. I always judge booksby their covers. The quality of the story is often reflectedin the amount of effort the publisher went to to present thebook. The best part of this book was the perspective it gaveon past periods of history, as it traced the provenance ofa purported Vermeer painting. I don't know how accurate theauthor was but at least the reader can get a sense of beingplaced into a world not of one's own immediate surrounding,which most good fiction does. On the other hand, the sense oftimelessness was stunted by that all-too-common contemporarypolitically correct characterization (female writers seem tofind this irresistible) which dictates that all the virtuouscharacters be women. Once again, most of the men arefoolish, misguided, or clumsy. I'm glad I read it nevertheless."
1,"So boring barely read it..., May 19, 2004","Here is my review (sorry it went through twice):I had such a banal time reading this tedious book I stopped reading within a few chapters. Uninteresting, undetailed, not at all intricate... if other children besides me have read Girl with a Pearl Earring, I could certainly make no comparison. This book completely drew my attention elsewhere... to the table, to the chairs and other things around me.I found myself being lured by that beautiful cover. But the book is so terrible..."
2,"Entertaining, but not a Vermeer","Though built upon a promising premise, this collection of short tales woven around a single ""lost"" Vermeer painting gets off to an objectionable start that I found difficult to get over. The suggestion hinted at by the ending of the first story, that somehow the painting itself should be destroyed because it had once been stolen by a Nazi, is unconscionable. A work of art acquires no inherent guilt through the actions of those who handle it; the suggestion is all the more inappropriate given the Nazis' own penchant for destroying art.Otherwise, most of the stories in the book were originally written and published separately, and this perhaps accounts for their somewhat uneven execution. I found the two middle stories, ""Morningshine"" and ""From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers"" to be the most compelling tales in the book, each more for the personal stories they tell than any protagonism of the painting itself."
3,A good read...,"I enjoyed this book, but had to keep reminding myself that it was written going back in time. I think I would have really enjoyed it more had I read the first story last - I actually went back and re-read it when I finished the book. While I do not believe in hauntings or possession, the painting had a curious effect on the last owner (first owner in book) and I am sure it was as a direct result of his feelings for his father and not the painting itself.I recommend this book - it is a beautiful story in my opinion.Kate"
5,Girl in Hyacinth Blue,"This story really begins at the end. It is both tragic, and heroic. The characters capture your sight, and you feel as though you can experience the depth of their emotions. The characters literally come alive on the page. It is a story told about lost innocence, sacrifice and the will to survive. A quick easy book to read, but yet so very complex. I recommend this book to anyone. It leaves the reader with something to ponder."
3,Never Really Hooked Me,"Creatively, Susan Vreeland's book is pretty special. Eight stories that move backwards through time that revolve around a Vermeer painting. Through each of the stories the painting manages to evoke particular feelings in each of the narrators, demonstrating the power and allure of art. As much as I appreciated her craftsmanship in the storytelling, the stories themselves left me a little cold. I didn't really have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters, so consequently I found myself being more of an observer and less of a participant.Still, it's a fast moving and easy read, and for people interested in art and artists, this would probably be an enjoyable read."
4,"Good, not Great","I really enjoyed the book, especially the descriptions of places. however, sometimes I was confused on the timeline because of the changes in each chapter. It did make the result interesting."
3,started slow,This book started slow but picked up toward the middle. The characters in the second half of the book were more interesting and varied than in the first half. It was interesting to follow an imaginary journey backwards of how the painting came to be in its present owner's hands.
3,"Nice premise, but lacks the hook to reel readers in","The thought of a newly discovered (or suspected) Vermeer painting would be an art world wonder. This book is a string of stories connected to the painting, tracing back through the years of how the identity papers were lost, etc. to make it a giant question at the beginning. The tales are more of the people around the painting than anything else, and it is interesting to see what a painting would go through to make it into modern times.However, something just lacks in this book. Dry writing perhaps. The ultimate hook never really latches onto the reader and no motivation to continue the book once one of the stories is over. It never really grabbed me as a reader.I'd suggest this to art lovers. Personally, Chevalier's 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' was much more entertaining."
1,Please tell me someone else hates this book,"I hate this book. I had high hopes because some coworkers raved, and I enjoy Vermeer and art and all that. But please...this overwraught, oversentimental thing made me yawn two pages in. The language is cheesy and even the interesting premise--following the painting's life from end to beginning--couldn't save it. The love scenes are laughable and the sad parts made me cringe. I suffered two weeks worth of bus commutes trying to wade through it."
4,"Nice concept , nicely written",The concept behind this book is great: how many times have each of us seen a painting and wondered where it had been and what kind of lives and hands the art has passed through? Each chapter in this book would stand as a short story in itself. It is the object of the painting that connects these chapters together in a cohesive manner. The book is a nice journey through history.
4,a must read,although this book was in print quite a few years agoi must say its one you can reread and enjoy time and again
3,It was interesting,I like the way the author describes how art can effect people in very different ways. I like this book and would recommend it for someone who loves art.
4,Mesmerizing,"I was mesmerized not only by the characters (of course, by the characters) but by the landscapes, by the natural forces portrayed, how they shape the people who shape the lives that follow their own down the path of time."
3,just keep reading,"I felt that Girl in Hyacinth Blue started really slow, which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4. But just keep reading, it gets really really good. Each chapter is a separate short story, each realted to the painting. And in my opinion, each short story gets better and better (I did not like the first two.) I was also slightly disappointed because I was expecting another Girl With a Pearl Earring, which I loved. Girl in Hyacinth Blue focuses on a chain of owners of the painting, where Girl With a Pearl Earring was the story of the girl in the painting. Girl in Hyacinth Blue is very unique and definitely worth a read."
1,overrated,"This book was not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. The chapters are jumpy, skipping several decades at a time. The author does not seem to really know anything about art history. Her descriptions of the artwork are superficial and ""fluffy."" If you like a good fictional book about art read ""The girl with a pearl earring"" instead!"
3,What a long book!,I read Girl in Hyacinth blue and I really did not enjoy it at all. first I thought it would be verey suspensful and very mysterious. but as I got into it more I realized that it was very confusing. it kept switching plots and that was so confusing. I thought that the author could of made it more simple and would have more of a surprising ending. I would reccomend this novel to someone who is a complex reader. but it had a very good plot.
4,A wonderful story and a great sense of timing.,"This is the first work by Vreeland I have read, and I enjoyed it immensely. The progression from the present day backward in time is unique and it works well. A very pretty little package, too, making this a natural choice for a small gift. You won't regret buying it."
4,An unraveling of the ages.,"Well researched historical fiction at its best. The most appealing aspect of this book to me is the unique manner in which it is presented. The author tells the story of the painting by giving us as an account of each owner, leading us back to its creation. The question in the back of the reader's mind is always whether the artist was actually Vermeer. Intelligently written with a clever use of language and a vast array of interesting characters, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Vreeland will be an author I add to my list of favorites. I would give this book 4.5 stars. Kelsana 8/27/01"
5,"Artfully written, a gem of a novel.","All I did was open the book. From the first page I couldn't put it down. Never have I appreciated Vermeer so, until I saw his work through Susan Vreeland's eyes. Novels that transport the reader to another time and place are rare these days. This one does. I loved it!"
3,"Great, but a little confusing","The Girl in Hyacinth Blue offers a unique perspective. The main character is not a person, it is a painting and each chapter is about one of the lives it affects. Because each chapter is about a different person and the book goes backward in time it can be a little confusing. I also did not like that some of the chapters have been previously published as short stories. The book felt pieced together until the end which flowed a little better. Despite this, the book makes you think about what it means to really know someone and about the things you value in your own life."
2,Contrived,"Not much of a book but maybe entertaining for those who want a book for the beach. Tracy Chevalier's book, The Girl With the Pearl Earring, is a much more engaging treatment of the same topic (Vermeer.)"
4,A Real Worth While Read!!!,This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Vreeland and I found her topic and storytelling to be very entertaining and very descriptive. This story tracks the path of a painting thought to have been created by Vermeer and we follow it from present day to back to the day it was created. This is really a story that is made up of several short stories each standing on it's own and the different effects this one painting had on each owner. I found this to be a very entertaing read and look forward to reading my by this very talented author!
5,Enjoy an easy read while you learn.,"The title of Girl in Hyacinth Blue could also be titled Life of a Painting. All who read this book will enjoy art more because of the wonderful description of the painting and the way the owners of it enjoy its beauty.Set in Amsterdam from 1939 to 1945, the story gives a wonderful history of the life of the people during WWII. Since the story gives the historical account of the painting Girl in Hyacinth Blue from present day to its beginning, you're reading a memoir backwards to find out how the painting came to be in the current owner's home.Enjoy an easy read while you learn."
3,"Meh. Interesting idea, so-so execution","I like the idea that the history of the painting is traced back through time to its conception. And several of the stories were well told....but not all of them. It's a light read, not offensively bad. Just don't expect it to be anything like ""Girl With a Pearl Earring."""
1,shaaaaaallow,"Read this for book club and all I can say is yuck. OBVIOUSLY written for the book club market. So lightweight, it floats. Deeply, deeply shallow. A cute trick the way it starts now and goes back in time but so what. It is a quick-read if that's all you want. And I'll tell you what bothered me the most was the chapter that was probably the most developed -- when the mother killed the deformed baby. Do a little RESEARCH would ya? Mothers didn't get hung for killing babies back then. Especially not a baby that would've starved to death in a few days. The whole thing just annoyed me. I left book club and dropped it in the nearest trash can. Not even worth passing along. Yuck."
2,A little slow,"I found the first half of this book to be fairly monotonous. While the concept for the novel--following a painting's owners all the way back to the painter--is interesting, Vreeland didn't really get me hooked in the first hundred pages. The stories got more interesting toward the end, but if I were a less voracious reader I might not have made it there."
1,Appallingly written rip-off,"In fairness, this is not really a rip-off of a better-known book about a Vermeer painting (Tracy Chevalier's lovely Girl with a Pearl Earring.) It's simply a dreadful book. Vreeland's prose is loose and sloppy, and some of the ""facts"" she presents in her stories are simply incorrect. However, what really makes this book a loser is that her stories are just dull, dull, dull. Every time I put this book down I had to *force* myself to pick it up again. Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time."
1,A slow start,Girl in Hyacinth Blue in my opinion was a dull book. It started off slow and it never held my attention. After a certain point I no longer knew what I was reading since I found the book to be too dull.
5,Wow!,"I loved this book! Vreeland's language is luminous, like Vermeer's paintings, and though each story effectively stands on its own, the sum total is greater than each of its parts. I am looking forward to her book THE PASSION OF ARTEMESIA due in 2002."
5,A Beautiful Book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Each chapter is a story within a story. The common factor between each chapter is a beautiful painting of a sewing girl. The author starts the book in present times and introduces the reader to the current owner of the painting. Each successive chapter links the painting to the various owners of the painting, and traces its roots back to the artist. This was a very quick, relaxing read. I was intrigued by the cover of this hardback because it almost shows the entire painting, but not quite. Much was left to the imagry provided by the writer. Enjoy!"
3,"Interesting concept and overall, a pleasing read","The concept of this book fascinated me from the beginning. However, the telling fell short of my expectations to be amazed. It's worth the read for the history involved in the handing down of an unknown masterpiece-just don't expect too much."
1,Sound and fury signifying: Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"A choice for my Book Club this month (Sep 2011), I too found it - frankly - boring. The only part of the book that I liked was the opening chapter. Thereafter, it was a chore and I did not finish it. Although I tried skipping ahead, skipping back again - no amount of skipping made it any more interesting or appealing. I just skipped reading the rest and closed it (mercifully). Fortunately, I lost no money on this book but simply returned it to the library.Girl With A Pearl Earring was far more interesting and imaginative IMHO.If I am the odd (wo)man out at our Book Club meeting, might be time for a new Book Club. This makes too many hyped titles: ""...sound and fury signifying nothing...""DD@Phila"
3,Literary fiction lite,"This is a pleasant simple read. What is wasn't (at least for me) is the literary blockbuster that I read about in the critical reviews. There just isn't that much meat to this work. I liked the format of vignettes going back in time. At the same time, that format left me hanging without resolution on some of the stories and thinking ""why bother"" about others. The writing has all the earmarks of modern, slightly pretentious literary fiction. Her writing it for creative writing classes comes through, unfortunately.Our book club struggled to find a half-hours worth of material to discuss in the book. We'd hoped for more."
3,Make it More Dynamic -As a Duo,"Read this book right after you read ""The Girl With The Pearl Earring."" Examined side by side enhances the reading experience. The juxtaposition of comparing and contrasting the way in which two women chose to approach writing about two different Vermeer paintings is interesting. Adding weight to both books, which can be quickly read. ""The Girl In Hyacinth Blue"" is like opening up a chinese box which unfolds another layer of interest with each turn. For further interest in the area, next read ""The Music Lesson"" (completely different,a good read, also addresses a Vermeer and written by a woman). The fourth one I have found and next on my list, is ""The Red Hat."" I certainly have a richer appreciation for Vermeer. Catch the exhibit in NYC at the MET, through May."
3,"Lovely photo album, but...","The novel was a beautiful idea, tracing a fictitious painting back in time. Unfortunately, the execution was not as lovely. Though each chapter is a beautiful snapshot (the farm family in the flood and the youth losing his ""witch"" love were especially moving) the passage between chapters was choppy and not nearly as elegant as each chapter itself. It was difficult to keep pace as the novel moves so abruptly through time. Where did the slave-traders' wife get the painting? How did it come into the hands of the older farming couple? These and many questions come up but are not answered. The novel is a case of the whole being less than the sum of its parts."
4,Very good,"I really liked this book. It was fun to travel back in time with the painting. I also read Girl with the Pearl earring and that was great too. This is almost like reading several short stories. Quick, fun."
2,Hard to follow the narrative,"I just couldn't get started on this one. The first chapters were intriguing, but as the narrative went backwards, I couldn't quite keep my interest. I've read ""backwards"" books before, so I'm not sure why this one didn't grab me. I still wonder about whether or not it was real (I think it was...) but didn't wonder enough to finish the book!"
3,Short and sweet,"Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a series of vignettes chronicling the reverse history of a fictional Vermeer painting of the same name. Vreeland's colorful portraits of Dutch life, from the wealthy to the poorest peasants, spanning several hundred years, are fascinating. I wouldn't have minded delving further into each of the tales, and the only other thing that could have improved the book was if the painting, which plays a silent, starring role in each of the stories, really existed.GiHB was enjoyable, but was a small disappointment after Vreeland's breathtaking Luncheon of the Boating Party."
3,Beautifully Written,"While this book was written beautifully; her research evident in all the stories, I didn't care for it. I was expecting another ""Girl With A Pearl Earring."" Even though it was brilliant the way all the stories led from one to the next, I would have preferred one long story. Vreeland is an excellent writer, I don't have complaints in that department, nor in any departmnt; it just wasn't my cup of tea. What it did do, however, is make me more curious about Vermeer's work. I plan to look up his paintings and enjoy his beautiful talent."
5,Worked For Me,"I needed a new connector for a Battery Tender cable.I cut the bad connector off the Battery Tender cable, cut this extension in half, and spliced the half onto the Battery Tender cable.Inexpensive repair."
5,Awesome Product,"As good as advertised. Great workmanship. Although I have not installed them yet, just by the looks and quality of the materials used, I'm sure I'll be happy with them."
5,does what it was made to do,works good nice product no cons just pros its a wire what can i say it does the job good
4,"melodic, emotional","Remember August's debut cd is a solid effort. The songwriting is amazing, combining similarities between simon and garfunkle, early smashing pumkins, and other lesser well-known emo-rock bands. However, at times the production choices seemed strained. Josh Pinkston's vocals are strong, with plenty of memorable melodies. the lyrics offer insight to the struggles and pain of lost love, dying friendships, depression, and a sense of loneliness. perfect for all your grey days."
4,Quality pair of shoes,"These shoes do exactly what I wanted them to do. They absorb a lot of shock when I go running so my joints don't have to suffer. Usually I would stop running do to joint pain in my knees, but since I've been using these shoes, I can run without pain in my knees. I recommend these shoes to any runner."
4,reebok mens fusiion road running shoe,"Purchased this for my 15 year old son. He found this shoe online thru another website but it was not available in his size. He likes the color of the shoe and the way it fits.My son has very wide feet so shoes that fit well that he likes the style of are hard to find. His feet also tend to sweat so needs ""breathable"" shoes.We did have a problem with the shoe about 2 weeks after wearing the shoe one of the shoes the ""tongue"" separated completely from the other part of the shoe.The return period had just ended but the Amazon representative was very helpful. She sent out a new pair at no charge, we then shipped back the defective pair using a return label at no charge.Only problem we had was that we only found two retailers with this shoe and only one with this size, even in the reebok store online and at the store in person."
2,it keeps breaking,"I'm on my second one of these, because the click-tab on the first one broke. It's not more than a month later, and this one has broken the same way. Six dollars may not be much money, but it should buy me a higher quality product than this. And I can't get the clip separately from the holster. If I could get them separately, I would just buy ten of the clips at two bucks a pop, because it isn't the holster that keeps breaking!"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"Although it works well for a phone holster, and I still use it today, mine broke just a few months after purchase. Poor quality, but it gets the job done."
4,yay,"My kid loves the Charlie and Lola series. no fast animation, no robots, explosions, or cereal sales tie-ins.just the adventures of a young man and his little sister, who is small, and very funny.I highly recommend this to anyone with kids, who is tired of exploding robot cereal sales pitch disguised as entertainment."
2,nice product but not as described,These valve cover bolts are a really nice design but I bought this set to match a 5 inch set that I have and these are advertised to be 5 inches long when in fact they are only 4 inches long and do not match my 5 inch bolts. I had to return them and I am still searching for the 5 inch ones to match the ones I have.
5,Definitive recording of landmark Arlen/Mercer score,"NY's City Center ENCORES series has produced a number of great revivals, but none more worthy than this complete recording of this stunning score. Previously available only on a truncated 29 minute original cast recording with Pearl Bailey, this new 67 minute recording with Vanessa Williams, Stanley Wayne Mathis, and Helen Goldsby glows with vitality and warmth in such classics as ""Come Rain or Come Shine,"" ""Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home,"" and ""I Had Myself a True Love.""Musical director Rob fisher conducts the swingin' Coffee Club Orchestra. Just great!"
4,ARLEN AND MERCER,"While they wrote many greats songs together(THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC,BLUES IN THE NIGHT),HAROLD ARLEN and JOHNNY MERCER were never really BROADWAY bound.However, this show had all kinds of misfortunes in 1946 and really deserved the second chance it got in 1998.Of course the original orchestrations were not quite the same as they are here,but the fact that the show could have a rebirth is in itself a reward that can not be denied.VANESSA WILLIAMS is wonderful.The show has one character miscast;it's easy to find out if you listen to the cd at least twice.Try to indentify it because i won't tell you.Overall, this revival is perhaps not perfect, but was certainly worth doing."
2,Sweet tooth warning,"I just finished watching this DVD. I can only compare my present stateto that of one who has been locked in a room full of crying, indecisive womenfor four hours and forced to eat a ten pound bag of sugar before he could leave."
2,Yawn..........,"One of the least imaginative blues CDs I'd heard in a long long time. And from one of the alleged blues harp ""masters."" Please. If you're looking for great harp, stick with Carey Bell, Kim Wilson, Rod Piazza, Charlie Musselwhite, Sugar Blue, Paul de Lay or James Harman. Billy lives in Chicago and seemingly has hogged up the lion's share of studio work there over the past decade or more. For the life of me, I don't know why that is. Connections, I suppose. At any rate, maybe his other efforts are more vital but this one is to Chicago blues harp CDs what frozen pizza is to Chicago deep-dish pie."
4,The Inventing and invigorating Mr. Timmons!,"This early recording of Bobby Timmons is maybe what not you expect with his backing of the giant Cannonball Anderly but it is a delight. He is stylish, improvisionist, and mixed well known standards with his own and the results blend quite nicely. I have always wanted his own recording for all thses years and discovered this one one day and have never tired of ejoying it."
3,"Great singing, lousy sound","I have to agree with both of the other reviewers, which is unusual since one gives this disc five stars and the other only one star! On the positive side the singing is wonderful--Bjorling, Victoria de los Angeles and Warren and Merrill were simply fabulous singers and that comes across even through the dreadful sound. And yes, there are moments where the shrill and distorted sound of the remastering just makes you grit your teeth. It really stinks, and I have a pretty forgiving ear for historical recordings!"
4,farenheit 451- a readers response,"I think that this book was an intriguing account of what a possible future society might be like. this book, though very difficult to follow or understand at times, was one i enjoyed very much.I do not suggest this book to someone who does not agree with cursing. If you are easily offended by the d-word, G-D, or h-e-l-l then this book probably is not for you, also if you have difficulty reading such as following the flow of words then this book is not going to make it any easier on you. Speaking of being difficult to read, the end of this book is a pain, it leaves you hanging, wanting to read more but you cant because there isnt a sequel and it the book ends on a very tense moment that does not have time to cool off with."
4,"Post-revolutionary Russian soap opera, but oh boy","Yeah, by today's standards, David Lean's Dr. Zhivago leans too close to schmaltz. But oh boy, when it came out a bazillion years ago, with marvelous shots of its two photogenic stars, Julie Christie and Lara and Omar Sharif as the doctor, it was full-blown mania. Gorgeous scenery both rural and urban lend to the epic grandness of this effort of a forbidden love affair in the midst of horror, famine, COLD weather, and a nation suffering. It won 5 Oscars, which gives an idea how popular the film was. It's still a good one, and the theme song, Lara's Theme, will forever bring the movie to mind.It's just a bit dated these days. If I were rating this 15 yrs ago, I'd have given it 5 stars."
3,Poor Audio...Excellent video quality!,"Saw this movie many years ago in my teens and have always wanted to see it again as my memories of it are sketchy. The film quality is indeed remastered and the quality is excellent but I find that with almost all the DVD's I purchase, the audio quality is extremely poor. This one is no different. My volume is maxed at 80. I can barely hear it and my Mom, who's 82, can't hear it at all. She just watches. So there's some disappointment for her. Me, I have come to expect poor quality now so will be pleasantly surprised when I do get a DVD with reasonable to good sound quality.Still, it is indeed one of the 'must-have Classics' and I'm glad I have it!"
2,Dr. Zhivago - Not,"I am disappointed w / this DVD, the movie was shortened on this version. Having seen the original movie twice before, this alteration was quite obivious. Won't purchase this type of item in the future, how will you know you are getting the complete film or not?"
3,BEAUTIFUL -- BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN ?,"New on DVD is ""DOCTOR ZHIVAGO,"" David Lean's take on Boris Pasternak's epic love story set against the Russian Revolution. This new digital transfer from restored elements looks and sounds great. Omar Sharif gives an on screen introduction and is featured on the anecdote filled commentary track along with Rod Steiger and Sandra Lean, the director's widow. Ample bonus material fills the two discs that include the new 30th anniversary ""Doctor Zhivago: The Making of a Russian Epic,"" 10 additional vintage documentaries, a music only audio track of Maurice Jarre's haunting score and more. There's not a lot of meaning in this melodrama, but the marriage of dazzling images and bittersweet emotions are about as good as film can deliver."
3,It is plain,"A big disappointment. Evidently some older movies cannot be made into good Blu Ray copies.My old copy of this movie I gave to my daughter, wish I had it back, I really cannottell the difference in video quality. What I do not understand one of my BEST Blu raymovies that I have purchased also from Amazon is ""The Searchers""."
3,Uh....It's pretty but give me a break!,"I've heard glorious review after glorious review about this movie and finally got around to seeing it on DVD last month. What is the big deal? It was a good attempt to desrcibe the story through visuals but short on dialogue. I have never read the novel which is probably why I was so confused the first thirty minutes or so. One second the main character is sleeping with his wife, then with his mistress, then back with his wife, then kidnapped by an army, then he escapes....etc. If you love short artsy fartsy movies than this one will do it for you otherwise stick with the novel."
2,Agressively mediocre,"This film follows the unhappy life of doctor and poet Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and his doomed love affair with the beautiful Lara (Julie Christie) during the years of the Russian Revolution. Although technically brilliant, the story is a romantic muddle full of coincidence and unexplained changes in character. Sharif and Christie generate little chemistry on the screen. Sharif's portrayal is bland and the character of Zhivago is unsympathetic; his treatment of his unbelievably saintly first wife (Geraldine Chaplin) is unforgivable. Rod Steiger's Komarovsky goes from villainous cretin to would-be benefactor with little rationale.As I mentioned above, the production values are excellent and director David Lean certainly knows how to frame a shot. If the film were shorter, these merits would elevate it to three stars in my eyes. However, such expense, effort and time wasted on such threadbare material simply emphasizes how lightweight the story is."
2,Scenery and Sets,It's unfortunate that such a grand effort ended in such a convoluted mess. Amazing sets and costumes will only carry you so far. I'm amazed that this movie is so highly regarded. Purchase at your own risk. Just be prepared to be bored and/or irritated.
2,Overrated,"Hammy acting all-around, a repetetive score, unlikeable characters (especially the protagonists) all wrapped in widescreen eye candy scenery. An airy bon bon disguised as amomentous drama."
3,Dr.Zhivago DVD,I only gave this a 3 star rating because the movie came in widescreen not fullscreen. This is an excellent movie and I would highly reccommend it.I just do not care for widescreen movies.If I had known it was widescreen I never would have bought it in the first place. Thanks.
1,Excellent Amazon 0 Zhivago 4,"You have to love a company that puts over one hundred reviews of a DVD that has yet to be released on its website. Amazonoids apparently don't understand one simple fact: DVD releases of the same film can vary in quality, extras, and accompanying material. And reviews for one DVD relief can be confusing when attached to another newer release. Bah humbug Amazon. I will buy this from another source."
4,Dr. Zhivago,This is an Excellant remastered DVD of th original movie.. Great Sound and Picture Quality! The Two Disc special with extra footage/info about the story was great!
4,Doctor Zhivago,"Lavish film about the Russian Revolution of 1917. Russia pulled out of World War I when it went Communist. Omar Sharif is Zhivago, an idealistic doctor torn between his wife and Julie Christie. Zhivago's ambiguity is mirrored in his poetry, judged too personal by the new order. We see the paradox of art and science. Zhivago's half-brother tells the story to a girl believed to be the offspring of the illicit affair. It is the formula for historical fiction, made up characters living their lives against sweeping events. There are some hauntingly beautiful scenes, snow and springtime flowers."
1,out of sync,"I like the movie, and the dvd set is fine, but I prefer to watch movies with the words and the mouth movements in sync. Amazon has sent me two of the two-disc special edition, and they're both out of sync."
2,Bad Quality,"I bought this DVD two weeks ago in Amazon, but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. First, I realized it was made in Mexico, and the disc quality was very bad, too fragile, and it seems like it was a pirate copy because everything, including the print in the DVD seems fake.Next, the quality of the movie was bad also, when I saw this movie in cable TV a few months ago, I thought the quality of the movie was very good, but in this DVD is very bad; it has bad resolution.Finally, in the characteristics of the product, it says it was in English with subtitles in Spanish and English, but that is not true. It comes in English, French, and Spanish with subtitles in the same languages.Now I understand why the price was lowered. Definitively, I would take more care, when I buy something at Amazon."
5,They Don't Make Epic Films Like this Anymore!!!,"If you haven't seen it do yourself the Favor and do, I Love this Digibook, a lot of behind the Scenes information and the picture and Sound were awesome."
4,Dr. Zhivago,"This DVD was sealed,in an excellent condition,received on time,no complaintabout.I thank the vendor as well as Amazon.com for the convenience."
5,best on all counts,"one of the best movies ever made. includes history, romance, action, suspense, and everything else a real movie goer would want to see. closley follows the life of the writer who won a nobel prize for the work but didnt collect because of the political climate in russia at the time. the greatest in literary tragedies since shakespeare."
5,Blu-Ray: Beautiful Transfer!!!,The film looks like it was shot yesterday! AAA+ 1080P transfer. Now when can we get Lawrence of Arabia in a similar set??
5,Classic,I have watched Doctor Zhivago year after year. You have to read also the book to understand the sequence of events.
1,Bad CD,"This is the 2nd CD set I have received for this film. In both sets the 2nd CD is defective. I returned the first one and received a replacement from Amazon. However I am having trouble completing the return process online for this 2nd CD in order to get a replacement. When I am at the page to submit and print labels it freezes up and will not go to the next page and complete my return/replacement order. I have tried numerous times on 2 different computers but it always does the same thing. I would like to have a good version of this film but don't want to be charged every time I send back a bad CD. Please advise on how I can resolve this problem. I still have this set, have not yet returned it to Amazon."
2,Doctor Zhivago DVD Poor Quality,I have loved Dr. Zhivago from the moment it hit the big screen but this DVD copy is of poor quality. It is cheaply produced and you discover that the movie is on both sides of the DVD. It is just disappointing. The lesson is that often when you buy cheap you get a substandard product...lesson learned. I'm going to find an old VHS copy to watch.
3,Long and tedious,Best to watch on a hot day. The photography is very good. The story is too long. Not great acting.
5,Got exactly what I asked for when I asked for it,"I forgot my step-dad's 60th birthday and had to overnight/express ship this DVD set to him and it actually ended up working out better than if I had remembered. He has wanted this movie for years because he went to the premier in the 60's on the east coast. He was home when it arrived on a Saturday and he ended up feeling more special because of all of the fuss and the hand delivery by FedEx. The film is stunning, as ever. I borrowed it as soon as my parents had watched it and it held up beautifully on my HDTV (61"" screen) which I did not expect. I was highly satisfied with the whole process and the product. I completely recommend using the ticker on items that tells you how soon you can get them anywhere in the country - fabulous little feature. Excellent service."
5,A WILDLY ROMANTIC MASTERPIECE,"I first saw Doctor Zhivago as a 17-year-old boy in 1965. I saw it 7 more times over the next year! It's perhaps the most visually stunning, panoramic, and at the same time seductive movie I've ever seen. Julie Christie and Geraldine Chaplin were both at the height of their beauty. Rod Steiger was delicious as a very complicated villian...and who could forget Omar Sharif's huge, melting brown eyes. The music was splendid and moving - the story stirring and tear-jerking. I'm a HUGE movie fan, and Zhivago will always be on my list of favorites. It'd make a great date movie alternative."
2,Are you an EXTREMELY Patient FEMALE?,"If you are a man, start running now! Although this movie is so slow that you could probably slither on your belly and still escape it.If you are a woman you may be able to sit through this seemingly unending saga of Soviet slush. But you better have plenty of patience. A good test might be to see ""Dances with Wolves"" first. If you can watch that without wishing that 90 minutes had been left on the cutting room floor, you MIGHT have the grit for Zhivago.I gave it 2 stars on the assumption that somewhere out there exists a movie which is even more torturous than this one."
1,Brilliant? Hardly!,"David Lean was in over his head with this film adaptation of the historic book by Pasternak. There is absolutely no justification for this movie to be so long since it hardly touches the complexities of its source. When I saw the film during its original release, I wondered why it was taking so long to get to the point. I never did get the ""point"". Then again I don't understand all the fuss around ""Gone With the Wind"" either.The performances by Shariff and Christie were amazing. By that I mean that it appeared that they were filmed separately performing their roles, then the results were edited together. Talk about no chemistry!Yes the cinematography is grand, however, the music score is minimalistic.If you enjoy daytime soap operas, then you might enjoy this film."
4,"Movie Blu ray disc is ok, the other 2 disc are not","The other two disc are only a sample of the original soundtrack, and the extras are in DVD quality. Also i received a package with the box a little damaged, new but a little crushed. Now i understand why it was so cheap."
5,Dr. Zhivago,"Great story telling. So much story to follow, so much history to learn and wonder about how the human race can survive so much."
5,Great movie,Very capturing and engaging. The violence is not nice to see but otherwise it's an amazing movie. Definitely one of the best movies ever made. And the music... I love the theme.
4,Classic mix of history and romance,"A classic. Great mix of history, romance and pathos. Plus Julie Christy and Geraldine Chaplin were so adorable back then. I couldn't take my eyes off either one. This movie has dated well. It's my personal fave romance flick."
5,Great Classic,"Saw it when I was a teen. Had to have itA love story,that will pull at your heart strings."
5,Its better than great,"This is one helluva great movie. There is nothing quite like it. You will be satisfied and fulfilled at its conclusion. I remember my Mother taking me to this as a kid, and there are some images from the movie that stayed with me. When I see it now, I get nostaglic because its part of my own history, as well as one of the greatest movies ever made. ALL involved were at or near the top of their game. I love this movie very much."
5,Still an Amazing Story and Movie,"I have not watched this film for many years. Watching it again reminded me that during civil unrest and political upheaval love still continues to triumph! Even though this film was produced over forty years ago, the techniques used are awesome. Considering a movie ""in-night"" for Valentine's Day? I highly recommend ""Doctor Zhivago""!"
1,Do Not Purchase This DVD!,Many scenes have been cut out. I saw the origninal movie when it originaly came out and this is NOT original.Do not buy this version if you want the original version. I wish I knew where to get the original.Please advise.
3,Russian Saga,"David Lean likes to make big movies and Doctor Zhivago is yet another in a line of his famous epics. The film is beautifully filmed from the picturesque winter Russian landscapes to the bloody battles in the streets of the Russian Revolution, Mr. Lean again provides stunning visuals. The problem with Doctor Zhivago is that the story veers towards sappy melodrama. Julie Christie is luminous as Lara, Geraldine Chapman, daughter of Charlie Chaplin, is very good in her debut and Rod Stieger is chillingly effective in his role, but Omar Shariff in the title role is dour and heavy handed. But Mr. Lean compensates for that as mentioned before with the film's stunning visual look and Maurice Jarre's score is among the most memorable in film history. The film is long and drags in places, but thanks to Mr. Lean's track record, worth a look."
4,a sad love story in epic times,"This film holds up remarkably well. The Doctor is such a flawed man that you can't help but cheer for him to succeed. Again, Lean has created a film that is like watching a moving paiting. The images of Russia, the winter, the landscapes are just beautiful. Then there is Julie Christie who is a treat to watch. Her best performance and you can see why Zhivago falls in love with her. Great score as well. A must-have classic for your DVD collection."
5,A Great Classic Movie,"I have to admit that I purchased Doctor Zhivago for my mom and she really seem to enjoy it. The parts that I did see both the audio and picture seem to be great. The DVD came with lots of extra with were enjoyed. I know that it took a while for Doctor Zhivago to come to DVD, but I can say that it was worth it."
2,45th Special Edition NOT special,"The reason this version of this wonderful film only merits two stars from me is due to the multiple jumps and freezes on the discs. Yes, that's plural. The second DVD I ordered to replace the first one also had the same problems but in different places on the disc. Don't know what's going on here, but the quality control for this edition is horrible. David Lean would be scandalized that his epic film is being so shoddily reproduced. I've now had to return this second DVD and am asking for a refund this time. I mean, what are the odds that the third one I'd get would also be defective? I'm going to try the two-disc set, see if it's got the same problems. Very annoying and totally unnecessary to have to jump through these hoops in 2011 to get a decently produced DVD."
5,very good,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas, she had the VHS, she was so thrilled that she now owns a DVD.The condition of used was in real good condition."
1,What a bore...,"I had always wanted to see this movie, considering the hype around it. Never got to see it on free TV and wish I had now, so I'd save the money I spent on the video. This film is a bore, to say the least. It seems to be more a tale of sexual license, rather than a expansive drama of a few characters against the backdrop of a revolution. The characters you care little about, ""Lara's Theme"" gets to be grating after a while, the city of Moscow seems to be one street with bleak looking buildings around it and the train ride is tedious. I like Julie Christie, but if you want to see her in a long, romantic drama that has a better score and is much more involving, see ""Far from the Madding Crowd"", from just a few years later after this. If you want to see a better David Lean film, watch ""Ryan's Daughter""."
3,A gal's movie,"Guys, this is a gal movie. If your wife/girlfriend wants you to watch this with her, be ready.I agree with ""Reads Alot"". Especially her comments on this film being way too long. [At 197 minutes it is only 11 minutes shorter than the 1956 version of ""War and Peace"".] It could have been done in much less time."
2,Neh.,"If you're the kind of person who loves the TV show, you will be the kind of person who hates this god awful movie."
2,OK On it Own--Unless You're a fan of the show,"On it's own, this movie is OK. It is certainly not a great movie, but if you are up late or bored, it might be enjoyable. However, if you are a fan of the show, as I am, then this movie provides little drug for your ""Buffy"" fix and fails to provide any significant history to a fan of the show. Also, don't watch the movie and expect to see the same level of drama/comedy/romance and depth of the characters as you see on television each week. If you are a fan of the tv show, watch/buy the series premiere ""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest"" as a starting point. Finally, while I like Kristy Swanson, she is no Sarah Michelle Geller who is the ""real"" Buffy (despite not being the original)."
3,Cute movie becomes Superior TV show,"This is where it all began. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was the introduction to the character of a high school girl called upon to tackle the supernatural evils of the undead. Many of the familiar elements are there: the Watcher, the training, etc. However, the movie was played more for laughs, basically trashing Joss Wheadon's original vision. Kristy Swanson is cute and funny as the title role, while Donald Sutherland is appropriately sage and befuddled as her Watcher, Merrick. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer's king vampire, with his cheesy fangs, seems like a bargin basement Dracula from a bad Hammer flick, while Paul Reuben's antics are so hammy, they belong between two slices of bread. The movie is entertaining, and it does provide a prequel of sorts to the excellent TV series it spawned. Otherwise, stick with the TV show, which FAR more superior and entertaining."
1,BAD,I thought this was a really bad movie! I LOVE Buffy but I thought this was soooooo bad it was boring. The frist time I wach this I have to turn it off but then I thought if I love buffy so much how bad could it be well let me tell you really bad!
2,Buffy The Vampire Slayer-The Movie,"Well I thought that the Movie was a bit on the cheesy side, nothing like the series at all! Series was the BEST!"
3,Good & Campy: Buffy before Sunnydale,"If you're a fan of the show the movie is a must as it fills in Buffy's background prior to the first season opener and answers the questions of why she was kicked out of school and how she ended up in Sunnydale. Driven by camp the movie shows where Joss Wheden was originally heading with a vampire ""horror comedy."" To Wheden's credit he allowed the characters to grow beyond the one-bite joke and turned it into a compelling show that rates high in its ability to entertain even after repeated viewings on DVD."
2,The lunacy begins...,"I've never been a great fan of teen comedies and this is no exception. I find it hard to believe the highly acclaimed TV series came from this daft film. Kristy Swanson sure is cute although perhaps as irritating as Sarah Michelle Gellar!?Anyway, this movie may prove TOO camp for fans of the series. I was hoping this would be better, but the vamps are just idiotic and the whole thing becomes rather tiresome.I suppose I could recommend it to fans of the series, but I'll bet you'll shun it, and I wouldn't blame you."
3,Not as good as the show but,The movie is nowhere as great as the tv series. Sarah M Gellar did portray a better Buffy. The acting in this movie sucked...but Luke Perry was hot in his prime(early 90s) One of the only reasons I purchased this movie...I've seen better quality blu ray films then this.
1,RUBBISH!,"If you like things about vampires, just watch the series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" staring Sarah Michelle Gellar."
4,Better than the show,"Buffy, the TV series, is nothing to the original movie. Yes, the series has better effects. Yes, it's acting is generally better. Yes, the vampires look and act as though they could actually kill something. But the movie will always remain my favorite of the two. There's something endearing about the bad 80's feel of the movie. It's refreshing to see a movie that bashes fitting into a lame crowd (as demonstrated when Buffy realizes that her shallow life before slaying was, in her words, ""STUPID.""). Kristy Swanson plays the role of Buffy. She delivers lines like ""Does the word 'Duh' mean anything to you?"" with perfect teenage exasperation. Donald Sutherland plays a fantastic Merrick, bringing an endearing eccentricity to his role as Buffy's tutor (or Watcher, as the term would later be coined on the TV show).If you're ever ridiculously bored, rent Buffy, pop a bowl of popcorn, and settle in for a fun, light-hearted movie."
1,get the tv show,this film is nothing compaired to the tv show sarah mischelle gellar is much better.
2,A waste of time,"Largely a waste of time unless you really, really want to see the prototype for the superior TV Buffy.Unexceptional picture and sound."
2,ok,This is a ok movie it is not as good as the show. The acctress Kristie Swanson is a ok acctress but Sharah Michelle Geller is a better buffy.
3,It wasn't the best movie or the worst movie I've ever seen.,"It was a good movie. I thought it was scary when I saw at the age of 6. You have to give Joss Whedon credit for trying to make the blonde the hero instead of the usual dumb one who goes into a room by herself without a flashlight. The comedy is good. Although I like it much better now that the vamps go poof and turn into dust. If you liked this movie or even if you didn't I think you should tune into the T.V. show Buffy The Vampire Slayer. It's better than the movie. Although I do think Kristy Swanson did play Buffy well and will always be the original Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar is the new Buffy and also plays her part well. Plus I'm happy that Joss put the whole Buffy-n-Angel thing in there. All in all I give it 3 stars."
3,Being first doesn't make it the best,"When I first heard that there was a TV show called ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", my first reaction was shock and disbelief because I remembered this film, and wondered how an entire TV show could be based on this light, campy, summer fluff film.The later TV series far and away exceeds its cinematic predecessor, but the film is nevertheless an entertaining diversion. Donald Sutherland is no Anthony Stewart Head, nor is Kristy Swanson a Sarah Michelle Gellar, and, heck, Luke Perry isn't even a Nicholas Brendon, but they're not trying to be. Fans of the TV show may be put off by the total disconnect between this fluff movie and one of the best shows on TV, but if they can break the connection, they'll find that this is an entertaining group film in the spirit of ""Bill and Ted"". Not great cinema, but not a bad way to spend $5.00. (which is what it cost me to see the film in the theater in 1992. How times change.)"
1,"Semi-Good Plot, but TERRIBLE Acting!","This movie would have been really good if the following would have been better: the script, the directing, the acting, and the people IN the movie. I can't stand Luke Perry, and I was sorry to say that I've actually SEEN this thing! If Amazon.com would have let me pick 0 stars for this, that's what I would have picked. This movie is TERRIBLE! I can't believe that somebody actually made a tv show off of this thing, it's THAT bad. I would NOT reccomend getting this movie, if you liked Pee Wee Herman, because the guy he ended up being is in this movie, and it's not worth bothering to see."
2,At least it got a second chance in a tv series,This movie isn't the greatest. So many things were wrong.1. The birth mark (It was big and nasty)2. Flying Vamps (Stupid)3. Vamps don't dust (There would be to many bodies)4. Vamps didnt change their face (Human faces w/ weird eyes & big teeth)5. Slayer Cramps (Stupid to have cramps as a reminder about vamps near by)Just a few examples. I know this was back in '92 but it still could have been better.The T.V series however is the best! The movie is not important to the show so dont even give it a chance.
5,Buffy's beginning,"If you're a Buffy television show fan you probably should watch this movie just to see how Buffy got started. It's kind of cheesy and the vampires don't dust, but it shows what happened before Buffy moved to Sunnydale."
1,Watch the TV show instead,"Okay, I recently was trying to get this friend of mine to watch Buffy the Vampire tv series, and they wouldn't do it because they'd seen this movie and they kept saying, ""The tv series is always worse than the movie"" Well, they sure are dead wrong! Because they are rather annoying and stubborn, I couldn't get them to give the tv series a try. I think they were just afraid that it would be as dumb and annoying as this movie is. This movie is TERRIBLE. The tv series is excellent, one of the best shows I've seen. In this movie Buffy is a shallow annoying person, and its all played up for laughs. If you have watched this movie and are relunctant to try the tv series out because of it, then please don't be! The tv series is wonderful, a hundred times better than this terrible movie!"
4,There's a new Slayer in town,"This fictional story is okay once you get past the fact that it is not the way it really happened. Don't you just hate it when the movies fool around with reality?And when characters are based on real people, at least TRY to make them look something like those real people. Sheesh."
1,Bimbo vampire killer with no life!!!,"To any of you that think this movie is great, try taking a reality pill!!!!!!!! I didn't care for this movie at all!!!! The acting was dull, you have kristy swanson who is a bimbo cheerleader going around killing vampires!! for a living. Jeeze!!!! I have seen better acting in my daughter's fourth grade school play about Dental Hygene!!!!!!! Neverteless, luke perrey DID not play a very good part in this cheesy airhead of a movie,more important he can't act worth a da-- in any movie or tv show."
2,I was just curious,"I got this movie cause I saw the TV show and I wanted to see what the movie was like. This movie is not that great and if it were not for the TV series, it would probably fall off the face of the planet. Do yourself a favor and just try to rent it from somewhere."
4,MUCH better than the TV show,"a very funny movie, lighthearted and funcompare this to the TV show, which is ponderous, pretentious, and generally heavy-handedthe choice of the better buffy is obvious :)besides, Kristy Swanson is MUCH hotter than Sarah Michelle Gellar"
1,This is what happens when Joss Whedon doesn't get his way,"Joss is a genius...I say let him do what he wants. Sadly, he did not get to do that with this movie, and it ended up sucking. The script is lame and fluffy, the acting not all that...tune into UPN every Tuesday at 8 and watch the show instead of this. When I went to Blockbuster, the guy at the counter had obviously seen it. He told me it wasn't from the show, and I said I knew that. He then tried talking me out of it...I was stupid enough to be stubborn. Maybe rent it if you've got a free rental on your Rewards Membership thing....but don't spend the money to actually buy it."
4,I liked it the same,"I liked the movie alot.I wanted to see it after I found out that the show was based on it.I'm a very big fan of the show,so I thought it would be interesting.All of my friends agree that the show is about as cool as the movie.If you want to start being a buffaholic,this is where you start:)"
2,"Too campy, too silly, no drama...the TV show is much better","Anyone who is a fan of Buffy the show, knows that it's superior to the movie in all aspects. Poor Joss Whedon probably wrote a great script about a young blonde highschool cheerleader who would ready to kick the butt of any vampire who cornered her in a dark ally. Because of this gift, the responsibility of saving the world would be overwhelming and she would long for a normal life and realize what can really be important. Unfortunatly, even though glimpes of Joss's intentions can be seen in the script, the intention was butchered like an Enron document through a shredder. Still, if you like campy vampire movies, you may love this. But watch the show and you will see the astounding difference."
4,A movie that has become a cult classic.,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a campy, tongue in cheek movie that has now become a cult classic. When I heard that a TV series was being made, I too went to check this movie out. Obviously quite different from the much darker TV series, the movie is none the less still enjoyable. Its funny as well as dramatic. Kristy Swanson will now always be remembered as ""the original Buffy"". With the TV series in existence, the movie will always be referred to as Buffy's first adventure (although the movie is not part of the TV show's continuity)."
4,"Don't take it seriously, just enjoy.","There are reasons why this movie can seem so bad compared to the television series: mostly its the entire ""feeling cramps when vamps are around thing"". Frankly the vampires steal this movie away from the mortals -- they are funnier by far, especially Paul Reubens. But it is good to check back on the earlier ""Buffy"" idea. Might make you appreciate the tv show more; it did me. I like to watch it about once a year for a great, fun, non-thinking time."
4,Buffy the vampire slayer (The movie).,"I would say you should watch this movie but it is better to watch it before you read the book.there is alot in the book that isn't in the movie.Despite this,I'd say this is a great film. If you are looking for a present for a Buffy the vampire slayer fan,this would be perfect!"
4,Funny movie that takes a beating because of the series,"This movie is funny. Unfortunately, it is dissected by the hardcore Buffy fans that were lured in by their love of the television series, and subsequently bashed.I liked this movie back in the day, and I still enjoy it. I never watched Buffy the Vampire slayer on TV, so I don't hold a grudge against this movie as its predecessor.If you watch this movie expecting what you saw on TV, you will be disappointed, but it's unfair to drag this movie into the mud just because it's not the same thing as the TV show.Overall, it's a funny movie that will give you a few laughs and that you'll enjoy, as long as you don't watch it expecting Buffy from the WB series."
3,Decent,I admit this movie wasn't the best and so was the acting but it is decent and pretty intresting I'd reccomend watching it if your bored. Belive me there are worst movies out there
4,The origanal Buffy,"I bought this movie because i LOVE the show and the comics. The movie wasn't as good but I still really enjoyed it. Kristy makes those tumbles look so easy but believe me, they're not. I ended up banging into the wall"
3,"the movie was good, but the show is better","The movie is good. It's funny, and the action is not intense but it keeps you in it, and the acting is good. But i didn't like Luke Perry in there though. The show on the other hand has very intense action, great acting, funny one-liners and, thrilling. If the movie was like this show ( with the same charaters and scenery ) then the movie would of been a five star. But otherwise i love the show and the charaters in the show exspecially Sarah Michelle Gellar herself, which makes the show top-notch."
4,Very Good Movie,The movie's excellent. Kristy Swanson will always be the original Buffy and she plays her part well. The movie has lots of action and always keeps you interested. It's humorous too.
4,The Funnier Buffy!,"This movie is just so funny. If you are a Buffy fan, watch this movie. I didn't even know that Ben Affleck was in it(Basketball player). Also, the vampire role is a much better one for Paul Reubens."
1,Very Disapointed!,I love the TV series but the movie is just... not good. The vampires are over-played and Buffy is just ... not good. Theres really nothing I can say. It was a really bad movie - I was disapointed but I did get a few good laughs after seeing how BAD it was. So rent it if you want to laugh at the badness but DONT buy it. You'll be so disapointed you might just puke.
2,Weak,"I first saw this movie when I was 10 or so at a birthday party and loved it! Now 5 years later I went out and bought it, since it was on sale (I would find out why later) and sat down with a couple of friends and got ready for some fun. Well the first thing we both saw was how horrible the dialouge was, the teenage 'slang' is exaggerated as our their actions. Even worse were the jokes, due in part to Kristy Swansons acting. The filming didn't do much justice to it either and the vampires were the most humorous villans I've ever seen.It only gets 2 stars because of the awesome show that would be made out of it later."
1,Bite Me,"The 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' movie starring Kristy Swanson isn't nearly as good as the T.V. series starring Sarah Michelle Geller as Buffy. The only really good thing about the movie is that the T.V. show came out of it. The make-up is only standard, really, compared to the series and I hated Buffy's mom.I am so happy they got Kristine Sutherland to be Joyce in the show. I say, only watch the movie if you really feel like you have to. Otherwise, just stick with the T.V. series."
3,What happened?,"For the love of all things green and fuzzy, what happened? How did it go from this great and funny movie with the stupendously hot Kristy Swanson to the just plain dumb TV show with impossibly annoying and angsty Gellar? Kristy Swanson was SO much better... (all IMO, of course)Granted, the movie didn't have Xander and Willow..."
1,"no, no, no, and no. Joss didn't like it. Ok? It's AWFUL!!",No. The humour is pathetic. The acting is...probably what their clueless director told them to do. Joss wrote it and everyone got it all wrong and butchered his idea.See the series.Forget this.It applies much the way Stars Wars fans treat the Phantom Menace.It's a menace.And it's a phantom...it never existed. Right?!
3,without the movie there may have never been buffy,"I first saw this movie when I was 7(mostly cause I had a huge crush on Luke perry and I instantly fell in love. This movie was fun Buffy is this rich popular cheerleading valley one moment and the next she is this strong female heroine. I used to make all of my friends watch the movie for once here was a movie with a young strong female. If the movie had been this huge success Josh wheden would have had no need to make the tv show. I remeber looking in a magazine and got really exstatic when I saw that they were making it into a tv show. The movie and show each stand on there on but you cant belittle the movie. True the show had more elements, but an hour and a half doesnt really give you time to delve that deep into a story(that is why there are so many sequels.) I say see the movie and think hey without out this sarah michelle gellar would have never been buffy."
2,Not so bad,"I've seen the movie in Italian, few years ago. It was nice and funny. Not much coherent, but ... who cares?I cannot say I love this movie, but sometime I like watch it and some of the jokes are great!"
2,Must have for Buffy Fan!,"This movie is a must have for any BTVS hardcore fan. If you're not then don't bother. This is the movie that started the greatest series on tv. And the creator of that show made this movie. However, being a huge disappointment to me, a huge buffy show fan, i only recommend buying this movie if you are totally devoted to the series. none of the actors in the movie are in the show. there is a whole new cast, but not creator and director, which is excellent, since the idea and direction were good, the acting and writing however, needs a little work. Pee Wee Herman stars and so does Luke Perry, which anyone can see is why the acting is bad. David Arquette also stars, also bad actor. Despite is badness, it is a great way to learn pre-series trivia and such."
3,"It's good, but it's NOT my Buffy.","I first starting watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer in it's third season, and I had to have everything Buffy-related. I didn't expect much from the film and thank goodness because I didn't get much. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was written by a brilliant writer...Joss Whedon, but you wouldn't be able to tell. The script was butchered and resulted in a so/so comedy. There might be ONE scene with emotional depth and the rest is fluff. This can be quite the let down for a TVBuffy fan like myself, but comedies are nice and can be enjoyed. I'd suggest renting this film or even buying it, but don't get your hopes up, because if you do you WILL be let down."
2,not to compare to tv,okay even thou i love the tv show I will try not to compare thenm to much.the movies was supposed to be silly and light. swason is all right as buffy all she is not the right age to play a 16 year old girl.i liked the donald sutherland as her watcher all he no giles. it was sad when he died. i cnat stand luke perry he is what keeps the from getting a higher review.
4,A fun movie.,"If you are a diehard fan of the series and you are really into the dark comedy and seriousness of Buffy, DON't SEE THIS FILM. If you love to just have fun and want to see a new take on vampires and be able to laugh, then this film is perfect. As long as you can enjoy a mindless fling into the world of the valley girls, you will love this film."
2,so-so,"I've always enjoyed vampire movies and as a kid this one was my favorite. Though its cheesy, i still like it."
3,Joss Whedon needed more control,"It's a well known fact that Joss Whedon (who wrote the film) was infinitely unhappy with how this movie turned out... it focused too much on making it a comedy and therefore it had a very short-lived time at the box office. It was meant to be a mix between drama and comedy, which is seen in the show, but instead they decided to lose all seriousness and make it a little too campy.However it does give a little extra to anyone who is even a small fan of the show. Although it fails to have the universal appeal of the show, (and the clothes they wear are a huge give away about the time it wss made). I don't condemn the film at all, but it stretched too far from Joss's original idea, and it was in that, that it lost my complete aprroval.It is very funny at times for what it is, and is still an enjoyable watch, and a must for any true Buffy fan."
2,......not so good,i'd like to say that this movie isn't so good.....it made me laugh but there are no horror scenes...and the cast isn't allright.in fact buffy isn't so good as the one performed by sarah michelle gellar. luke perry is awful and the only thing i liked is cassandra's death. watch it but i don't think u'll go buying it...
3,This film might offend you if you like to sleep all day,"Excellently funny comedy/horror about a ditsy cheerleader who discovers she is the decendant in a long line of vampire slayers and needs to join the cause. Along the way, she falls for a concerned auto mechanic and saves the day, without even breaking a nail. Hilarious laugh out louder is aided by the funny Pee Wee Herman and her cute little fair weather friends but harmed by the need for stability in the role of the head vampire which should be colder."
3,Not what I was hoping for........,I have spent many weekends in Napa Valley and did not feel that this book captured the many beautiful homes and wineries it has to offer. The book was uninspiring and I have not picked up the book once since I first looked at it.
3,Poor Grey-scale Printing,"The content is good, a four star rating, however the publisher, Baker Academic is 2nd rate. The author allowed his 'comparitive' insert writings to be set in dark grey and a smaller font, upon a dark-as-pencil-rubbing background: almost illegible."
5,Great replacement for plastic bags!,Just cut & sew this fabric into little sandwich bags. You'll never have to use plastic baggies again. Oilcloth is easy to clean with a sponge & makes a great replacement for plastic rubbish.
4,Jill Nagel et al Open our Minds to Sex Worker Feminists,"I checked this book out from my college library and thoroughly appreciated the intelligent discussion and firsthand experience of the contributors. As a feminist myself, I wasn't quite sure of how I felt about women in the sex industry. This book helped me to understand that women in the sex industry are stereotyped and that customers of these industries are too, while it attempted to explain the paradox of the ""feminist sex worker."" Overall, it had great insight to the industry intermixed with feminist theory to explain or analyze the sex business."
3,Helpful but lacking,"This book is very helpful to people in the sex industry who don't have a voice. However, the stories are more gory than they are informative. Sometimes it reads like a Jerry Springer show and it causes the women to loose their voice of dignity. I doubt the book would sell decently if it were not for the glorifying of the ugly, but that element in the stories dilutes the message that the title purports to convey. The story of feminism is lost in a blur of Jerry Springer exagerations of the profession. Overall, the book is still a big contribution to sex worker literature where very little exists, but the book fails to express any firm notion of real feminism among its expression of the bizarre."
4,"Entertaining, thoughtful and fun!",My husband and I watched this documentary/ movie last weekend-we are both in our 60's and grandparents-that being said we really enjoyed this movie. Some parts were funny and cute-others thought provoking. Great movie for older teens/college kids. I am recommending this to our youth leader for the teens-for finding ways to open up about the gospel to others.
1,not Christain just kids,"not so goodI bought it with the other one ""beware of Christain"" and is not a movie I would watch with me kids or teenagers"
2,Could have been good,"If they would have done a lot less flip-flopping, and had been a little mature it could have been a great movie, but with all their antics I soon lost intrest."
3,"No need for this one, get ""Setting The Pace"" instead","There is no need to purchase ""The Trance,"" one should get ""Setting The Pace"" instead. The reason is that two of the three songs on this album, the title track and ""Speak Low,"" are included on ""Setting The Pace"" along with two live songs featuring Dexter Gordon. You have to be a real Ervin fan to get this CD just for ""Groovin' at the Jamboree."" Not that the music isn't good, it's fantastic, but all in all there is no need for two separate releases of basically the same material."
5,Mystic Island,"The best books I have read are the ones where I forgot there are words. Jan Evan Whitford's, Mystic Island, put me in that place where the ""words"" on the pages disappeared. Instead I engaged in what I saw, heard, touched, and felt. I not only ""watched"" the action, drama, and comedic scenes of this down and dirty, yet heartfelt mystery, I became a part of its life. Mystic Island is the kind of ""Who done it?"" that makes noise, because you get to interact with the characters, - and there are certainly some shady, as well as laugh out loud (LOL) characters on ""Mystic Island"". The author's knack for this type of storytelling is salient, - I will be looking for more by Mr. Whitford."
4,Fiction book based in RI,"""Mystic Island"" is a book filled with comedy, mystery, sex and violence. It is a little hard to follow, and there are many story lines but you still get pulled into the story. His style of writing is also a little primitive. It is based in ""Mystic Island"" which I'm pretty sure is code for Jamestown, RI. Finding a fiction book based on summers in Southern RI has long been a dream of mine, which came true when I received this book as a gift. It is mostly written through Environmental Police Officer (EPO) Nikki O'Connors view, and her dealings with the campers and fishermen of Seabreeze campground.If you are into World War II history, especially in Narragansett Bay, I recommend this book. It even mentions Walter Schroeder's book in the middle of the story. HOWEVER, do not intend to read this book as if everything is true.. because it is a FICTION novel. I'm interested to see what else Mr. Whitford comes up with."
5,Whitford's debut novel a real treat.,"Jan Whitford's debut novel wonderfully describes how zany life on a small New England island can be. The book is funny, romantic and suspenseful. I particularly enjoyed the antics of the campground crowd. I highly recommend Mystic Island, and I can't wait for the next book."
5,Laugh Out Loud Thriller,"It's no oxymoron. Mystic Island is a fast-paced thriller that keeps you guessing, biting your nails, and belly-laughing, all at the same time. Some of the characters are caricatures, some are downright nefarious, some are everyday people, but they're all vividly brought to life through Whitford's witty writing and unique voice. It's a wild ride on a wonderful read."
2,"Not World War II, But Stolen Lobster Mystery","This mystery is very weak, with historical misinformation thrown in to make the premise blievable. Though about where to find a long lost Rooselvelt-Hitler letter at the begging, it quickly turns into who is stealing lobsters from ocean traps. The majority of the novel revolves around this lobster mystery. To bolster hisory, the author shows his ignorance by incorrectly bringing in two (2) historical inaccuracies: Radio Free Europe was founded in 1949 with a first broadcast on 4 July 1950 to Czechoslovakia, not 1945 as he says; Joseph Goebbels was never in the military because of his club foot, therefore he was not a General as the author says. He was the Propagamda Minister for the Third Reich (and a very good one.) My biggest complaint is the very short chapters (mostly 2--3 pages, which comes out to 80 chapters for 229 pages!) I believe this author needs to take college creative writing courses."
2,"Pretty, but Almost Impossible Not to Break","I bought this to make a few necklaces with. Well, the quality is far from great.I wanted to test it before giving people crap, so the day it came I grabbed two sides and yanked - lightly. It snapped like a twig. Tried it again but lighter. Snapped again.If you buy it, it will break if caught on something. It's very cheap, very crappy. Pretty, but I'd never buy again. I actually just threw it out because I refuse to give people crap, and it seems like that's what this is."
5,AWESOME,This is a classic example of awesomeness! IT has Ringo having lots of fun with his audience a d telling some great stories.
3,He loves it . . . and maybe you will,"Ringo Starr says, ""I love it,"" several times between songs on STORYTELLERS. He's having fun playing some great songs, the reason most muscians first pick up a guitar (or, in Ringo's case, first take a seat at a drum kit): the love of creating good music and pleasing the crowd. This long-time fan would have sacrificed one or two George Harrison collaborations to hear tunes Ringo wrote with Vini Poncia (""Oh My My""), Joe Walsh (""In My Car"")and Johnny Warman (""Don't Go Where The Road Don't Go""), for the sake of more variety. Included are a few new Starr songs, and ""I Was Walkin'"" and ""What In The World,"" hold their ground alongside Ringo's classics. STORYTELLERS packs a lot of fun listening, and, Ringo, if there's a volume two, I would love it."
4,one of the best solo Beatle performances live!,"This on eof the best live solo Beatle albums ever with the exception of George Harrison's Live In Japan, which still remains the best live performance by a Beatle ever...sorry John and Paul, but your live materiel sounds dated like Wings Over America & Live in NYC (paul gave the world more live materiel on disc than any other unfortunately)....here Ringo is in fine form with a great representation of his whole career from the 60's to the present...his humor shines through, which made him loveable in the 1st place...the backing band is tight.....do yourself a favour...forget about the all-starrs...this is the best live Ringo you'll find..."
2,hartz vitamins for dogs,there is no way of spilting the tablet in half..it is too big and thick..have to use a pill cutter....before they redid the tablet you can spilt it in half with your fingers...customer service at hartz was very indifferent and seem like they didnt care...........bad customer service and offer no remedy to the situation.....
1,Constipated my dog,"My puppy (he is 7 months old) was on a beef and rice diet for a while. I decided that he probably could use some vitamins, so I started giving him these vitamins once a day. The day after I started him on the vitamins, he became constipated and did not have a bowel movement until the day after I stopped feeding him the vitamins. He was on the vitamins for a week - that's a long time for a dog to not go! The plus side is that they are easy to find and cheap, so if your dog does not have a sensitive digestive system, maybe the vitamins won't have this affect on him/her."
5,Jazz Flute of the Highest Order,"Bill Evans did not record too many collaborations with other artists outside of his own trios, probably because few could hold their own in the presence of his intensely emotional improvisations. Well known are his fine recordings with Jim Hall and the album he made with Toots Tiellemans - Affinity.Far less so is this session with Jeremy Steig, son of the more famous cartoonist William Steig. Jeremy's main efforts were in the Jazz Fusion field which was in vogue in the late sixties and early seventies. This recording attests to his astonishing ability in the straight ahead jazz genre. More importantly, the level of his emotional expression at least puts him in Evan's musical ball park, and Evans,in turn, seems to be inspired by Steig's breathy and adventurous solos.The original album was tough to find, so this reissue is very welcome, particularly with so few jazz flautists currently active. Highly recommended."
2,Batteries Not Fresh?,"I'm giving this product 2 stars because Eforcity shipped quickly and when I emailed them about the inability of the battery to hold a charge for very long they quickly shipped a replacement free of charge. Good customer service. Unfortunately, the second battery exhibits the same behavior, holding a charge---with extremely light phone use---for about half the time the original Motorola battery did. So I strongly suspect these are not real Motorola batteries, or they are simply too old to work properly."
4,Definitely a page turner,"I've read a number of fantasy novels and this one didn't dwell on the magic and mystery aspects, but instead dealt with the political structure of the world our heroes are involved in. The story boggs down a bit during the middle but overall it was a great read."
4,The Last Great Book By a Politician?,This made me wish that Bradley could have emerged as a strong presidential candidate. It covers a really fascinating life well and does so in a thoughtful and honest way. Could this be the best book writer by a politician?
4,Enjoying and Informative,"This book was both enjoying and informative. If your a basketball fan of the late sixties and seventies you will enjoy this book. I'm sure todays players would have a completely different lifestyle than their predecessors, but Bill gives you a picture of his day and insight into his cast of characters/teammates. I enjoyed this book."
3,An interesting historical perspective,"Corcoran was an experimental psychologist and lecturer at the Open University, writing during a period when computer models of perception were beginning to be used in psychology, but before cognitive science had become an academic discipline drawing equally from the fields of psychology and computer science. In 1970, departments of computer science were still new in universities, if they existed at all. The work was intended primarily as an inexpensive text on the psychology of perception (confirmed by the imprint price -- 50p -- and the awful paper on which Penguin printed it). However, it does contain a chapter on pattern recognition by computer, including a review of the early work by Bledsoe, Grimsdale, Rosenblatt, and Selfridge on visual patterns and a short section on early computer speech recognition work by Hughes and Hemdal at Purdue."
3,Important but Incomplete,"Kinsey makes a clinical contribution to the study of private warriors and military corporations. His attempt to define the various Private Military Firms that exist bogs the effort down and confuses when attempting to introduce an accepted typology. He acknowledges the difficulty in the exercise but falls victim to it nonetheless. Outside of this, he does a great job summarizing this history of freelancers through mercenaries to current day ""contractors"". He raises the need for greater oversight and regulatory guidelines for the entire industry. A solid contribution but retreads much of the same ground P.W. Singer covered in 2003 in Corporate Warriors."
2,Disappointing,"Being a big fan of the Ballykissangel series, I own and have watched all the previous. And unfortunately each series has gotten progessively more disappointing with this one actually not watchable. Its slow, boring, and has officailly Jumped the Shark. I'd pass this over and stick to the first three in the series."
4,Great show!,Interesting to get some idea of how the Irish live. Love the accents of course and the characters. Though there have been some changes in actors it has been most entertaining.
5,Ballykissangel.,"See my other review about the series. I miss watching it everyday, I watched all 6 seasons. It's a great series."
1,Very disappointing,This series was offered for a long time as a free stream to those with a Prime account. Now Amazon has pulled it off stream and is demanding $34 dollars to obtain the episodes. The price is ridiculous for a show that has been off the air for a decade.
1,Stick to the first three series,The first three seasons are wonderful! However......after season 3 they try and try....and try...to recapture the magic of the first three and never do.
2,Why didn''t they get rid of Donnal and Liam?,I did not enjoy season 5 anywhere near as much as I had the previous seasons. Donnal and Liam were becoming more and more annoying and they seemed to take up a larger part of each program. I also cringed every time Uncle Minto made an appearance. Where did they get him?I knew that many of the characters were just going to disappear without any kind of acknowledgement at the end of the season 5 and figured that it would best to stop watching at that point rather than be further disappointed with season 6. I was wrong. Season 6 is wonderful and you just have to get through season 5.
1,Toots Ruined It! Awful! Don't Buy This One!,"Toots Thielemans should not be allowed to perform if he persists on playing harmonica. Harmonica is one of the worst instruments ever created. Not only is it annoying, but it ruins the music.The band is great. I love Oscar Peterson, but you couldn't hear him or the rest of the band over Toots' annoying harmonica playing. I didn't know Toots was going to be playing the whole concert. One of the worst albums I ever heard thanks to Toots."
4,loved it!!,"This book is a great read. I would recommend reading the first book ""Iron Lace"", in this series of two, or you won't get as much out of ""Rising Tides"". I really liked the way this fills in information about other's lives rather than just Aurore's. Emilie Richards is a great author, I've loved all her books that I've read."
2,Very disappointing,I found after reading it for awhile that I had no interest in even finishing the book. I got very bored and quite after reading more than half.
4,great book,This is the second Emilie Richards book I have read. She is a wonderful author. I plan to read all her books.
5,Rising Tides,"Emilie Richards is a wonderful writer. The other books in this series were eonderful, too, especially Iron Lace."
5,Good book,Great study on numbers in Scripture. Very informative for study beyond words and into how numbers are used and what they mean.
5,crystal,Shows meaning of numbers in the word of God. All numbers have a meaning. Great study tool. All need this and many other tools. God Bless.
2,Get the Book,I got the Kindle Edition for 99 cents. It is almost worth it. It may be okay for reading straight through but not for study. For that you need a table of contents and a good index.
2,Kindle edition NOT good,"It does not read well, as it is a list of items to be further researched and validated with study.And, while the content is intriguing and worth study, the kindle version is nearly worthless.* The kindle edition does not render Hebrew correctly (it's a jumble of characters & letters), though greek seems to come through, usually.* The 'tables' do not align when presented.* There are no breaks, chapters, etc to make navigation easy and this edition as a worthwhile reference."
2,No e-book contents,An ebook like this does need to have links from to content to reference the numbers in this case. I own a printed copy of this book and hoped to use the ebook version.
3,Too much,A good resource for numerology in the Bible but too much information - overwhelms the reader. Not for the first timer.
5,This book has been a great faith builder for me,Bullinger shows the magnificent orderliness of the Word of the Creator. The book shows how God (YHWH) uses numbers to symbolize various concepts. Each number is always used to show the same concept throughout the entire 66 books. The number 7 is a good place to begin study as it is emphasized. Certain names and words are repeated 7 times throuhout the 66 books even though various men set down the words to paper. Only the Holy Spirit could have designed such order. No man nor computer could have produced such results. Bullinger gives many examples. He provides the original Greek and Hebrew texts in his examples.
5,An excellent guide for the Studio Photographer.,"I found this video by Mr Brian D Ratty the best and most informative video on Studio Photography that I have ever found. It has the information to allow a photographer to produce top quality studio productions. And I personally like the way that he explains the procedures of studio setup and the operation of the Large Format camera. Everthing in the video was very helpful to me, a Photographer that is setting up a home studio."
4,Just loved the shoot outs and the story,"This was a great ganster movie reminiscent of the late 30's and 40's US ganster flicks, but with much better action sequences. Like an old George Raft flick it pits two brothers on opposite sides of the law against each other. But show stealer is the best friend ""Mark"", who with double 45's blazing, blows away a rival gang in what is one of the best modern shoot outs ever captured on film. The plot is tight, with stylish swaggering gansters that rings true. In my opinion, for viewers who love the old genre of ganster movies this is a must see and own video."
1,Anchor Bay DVD is defective-DO NOT BUY,"This DVD is defective. It has the wrong soundtrack not original to the movie. It is remixed from other American films. Do not buy it. Instead, write to Anchor Bay at questions@anchorbayentertainment.com to ask them to return the movie to its ORIGINAL soundtack."
4,Good Action Movie,"First of all I'm 14 not 12 like it says above this review. This is a great John Woo movie and as always in a great action movie there are excellently choregraphed action scenes.The only downside is I think they could of enjected alittle more gunfights hence 4 stars instead of 5. I mean compare this to The Killer or Hard Boiled. Both those movies had tones of action, while this one does not. Sure the scene at the end and the one in the restraunt were good but that is the only two that resemble any of the hardcore action that The Killer and Hard Boiled are great for. If you are REALLY looking for tones of action watch The Killer or Hard Boiled. And if you already own those movies THEN buy this one. And if you are new to Hong Kong action movies then you should check out the The Killer (its in my opinions is Woo's best work.)Anyway happy viewing!"
4,Must-see for the Woo aficionado. Exciting HK action,"While occasionally under-rated, I consider this some of Woo's best medium-level work. Not in the class with The Killer, or Hard Boiled, but carrying the expected Woo storyline about a not-so-bad bad-guy (pair of them, actually), and the bad things that happen to them. Certainly recommended for fans of Hong Kong action movies, and required viewing for Woo fans"
5,Love it,"I love this movie. I got this movie really fast and there were no scratch marks on it from being used. I think John Woe should remake this film, it can only make it better."
4,Great chou youn fat with black coat,"The image of the chou is very imppressive. Usually oriental people like the loanly image of the chou very much and they wish to show them selves like chou with wearing black long coat. If you get closer with this movie, you'll easily familliar with the oriental people."
2,A Five Star Film Ruined By Poor Transfer To DVD,"A wonderful movie overall, but the subtitles are terrible and distract from enjoyment of the film.The letters are too big, and often only four or five words are fitted per line, so an additional line of subtitles is necessary, taking up the bottom 25 to 30% of the screen. Can't see the movie for the words! The same holds true for the sequels.I'd buy another copy if only they'd fix this aweful production flaw.DON'T BUY IT! Wait for an improved edition! Too high a cost for such a faulty product."
1,The Destruction of a seminal action film,"What can I say? I love John Woo, and this is an incredible movie, but please do not buy this DVD. Buying this DVD will tell Anchorbay that what they did was forgivable, and it (I am referring to their God-awful remix of the soundtrack) is a travesty, a crime against mankind, and hell-worthy trespass. Words cannot express the anger I have towards whoever thought that it would be a good idea to remix (if this is indeed a remix or just a gross oversight) this film's soundtrack with music from Forrest Gump, Speed, and several other cute movies. Apparently they for saw this situation and planned for it by not including the credits on this DVD!... Be warned, and wait for a rerelease."
3,What happened to the original soundtrack?,"First off, I LOVE this movie in its original form (Cantonese version way back in the 80s). The DVD version suffered from a few FATAL flaws: the Cantonese version had a different soundtrack for a few scenes, the Cantonese version had a mis-dubbed Mandarin dialogue (the scene in the bar with Mark, Ho and Shing was in Mandarin!).Good thing is, the English version had the original soundtrack but nonetheless, the dubbed version never captured Mark's (Chow Yun Fat) outstanding use of tones and pitches.This re-release really disappointed me, and destroyed a masterpiece that I loved."
2,"Great film, DVD will ""tramp"" you.","In case you didn't get the message from the last few reviews: do NOT buy this DVD unless you have no other option for seeing this film and can't wait for a better release to come along. The subtitles are so bad as to make certain scenes incomprehensible; the audio transfer is terrible (the characters sound like they're in a tin box, the vocal track is out of sync, etc.); and the print is faded and it looks like no attempt was made to clean it up in digital transfer. Nevertheless, the film is a blast, and you don't really need to understand the dialogue to follow the plot. To quote from the subtitles, you don't ""loose"" much and you won't feel ""dump"" if you can't understand exactly what's being said."
1,A Better Version Available.,"I bought this when it first came out. Up till then, it was only available as A: Horrible Boot-leg or B: Horribly Translated English-Dubbed VHS. So I bought thinking I hit the motherlode. It did have a pretty decent transfer & was letterboxed in it's 1.85:1 ratio instead of it's usual boot-leg 1.77:1. However, the first thing I noticed was that all the original score had been replaced! I don't know if this was corrected later or what, but I was very disappointed. Not only was the original good music gone, but it was replaced with sound-alike versions of the score from ""The Terminator"" and ""Forrest Gump."" AHHHH, the agony. Anyway, it was just re-released not too long ago by a different company, and though I haven't picked it up, I've heard it's there in all it's glory. Trust me, stay away from this version."
4,Irish Traditions and Legends Simplified,"What a wonderful book for adults and children alike. I found this book to be a terrific help in understanding some of the legends and history of Ireland and St. Patrick's Day. It was also invaluable in explaining these to my younger children, both at home and in Sunday School classes.Both the writing and the illustrations work to offer a better understanding of Irish traditions. All in all, not only an educational read, but a pleasant one, too!"

4,Wonderfully engrossing. First rate novel.,"I went on a trip and did not bring the fourth installment of this series because I assumed I would not finish Daisy's Folly. Wasn't I mistaken! I finished it before I even boarding my connecting flight. I was particularly pleased that Ms. Page did not see the need to use a lengthy back story to introduce her characters. She knows that we already know them=). While I thought the plot for the murder was a bit stretched, and that keeping the numerous characters straight was a trial, I still think it was a good story. The artifice involved in the characters is so enraging to the modern mind that it's a wonder you don't scream at Lord Warwick to do something. For God's sake, the man's wife is having an affair right in front of him! Ah, but those were different days. Good riddance!"
2,Disappointing,"While I enjoyed the first novel in this series, I thought this second novel was not up to par. The characters were not particularly deep or engaging and I was not sure why Beatrix Potter was in the plot. I was not drawn into the characters' world as I had expected to be based on the first novel and probably will not pick up the next novel in the series. It seems to me that the author(s) were aiming at a much younger audience than grown women."
3,More Victorian Mayhem,"These authors can write a good Victorian mystery. It helps that they delve into the history books, and use actual incidences that lend credence to their story. This book talks about Queeen Victoria's son, Albert's propensity for married lovers - some of the worst kept secrets from that era. Daisy was a real person and was actually involved with the Prince. The story is realistic, and the characters are niceley portrayed. I really like Charles and Kathryn and think they make a good detective team. The mystery behind the story is a good one, and the motive is ""Oh so Victorian"". I recommend this series to those that enjoy this period."
4,Rockin!,"Barrence Whitfield and the Savages caught live - what a treat! Despite being 20 years old, this CD still rocks. Catch Barrence live if you can! (it helps to be in the Boston area!)"
3,HI FI Baby From Outer Space,"This CD burned from first note to last. The sound on a few cuts is somewhat garbled, but this adds to the urgency of their music. Imposibible to pigeon-hole, The Savages are a very exciting group."
4,LL Rawks!,"Limblifter is a truly creative album. For those who are new to the band, I'll tell ya that Ryan and Kurt Dahle are also 1/2 of another band, The Age of Electric (my fave band!)"
3,Big let down,"Season 3 is a drastic drop in the writing of the show. I had high hopes for the prison storylines, hoping it would be a comedic version of OZ. It had it's moments but was a big let down for me, missed a great opportunity.It gets much worse though when Earl is out of prison. I was a huge fan of season 1 and 2, then this season seems like it written by different people. Most of the story is really terrible and the gags aren't funny.Did they decide not to do commentaries because they knew the season was a stinker ? If you already have seen the show there is no reason in buying this DVD set, it has not one interesting extra.I hope season 4 is better, or Earl will be a flash in the pan as far as I'm concerned."
2,Goofy!,"This/these are beyond lame! The new season is all about Earl in prison. No karma nonsense, just half baked episodes about ...prison?!?!Thank god for Jason Lee or this would really blow!"
2,Not really good,"While the first two seasons were very successful, the third season is awful. THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut. The problem is that the show was really very good. Until, at first Earls goes to prison, during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse, a lot worse. Also, while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really."
2,Meh...,"The season broke with the formula and ended up suffering for it...but there are still some pretty good moments.Main complaint is the SHOCKING lack of special features on the DVD. NO COMMENTARIES = NOT WORTH IT. I'd only buy it if you need to catch up on the series, if you're a collector, or if you don't care about special features."
3,off the track...,"I love this show,but i feel it went off the track with its story this year.the whole earl in jail was good but than the whole coma and dream set in a 50's type tv show was long and somewhat unnessary.I hope they get back to what made the show one the best on tv."
3,In perfect Jason Lee fashion!!,The third series is great. It ventures deeper in to the lives of the cast and gives some rousing humor. Great gift for Earl lovers everywhere.
1,Karma intended for plots to be simple,"Karma intended for formulas and plots to be simple. My Name is Earl was never screened on television where I came from for a pretty good reason - the story-line was dumb, the themes confusing and too R-Rated and the episodes beginning to become too stale and painstakingly lengthy. You could sense that the writers were scrapping the bottom of the barrel when they dwelled on homosexual prisoners from rival gangs and prom night in prison. If you want to have good memories of what a great TV series this was, stay away from Season Three."
5,GREAT SHOW!,This is a great show!! We watch it while working out in our gym and it makes the time go by so fast!!
5,earl...what's not to love?,"earl has been through so much this season...jail, freedom, denying the list, being in a coma, getting married...wow. ""creative writing"" is one of the most hysterically funny things i've ever seen in my life!"
5,Great message given in a hilarious way,It's a little rough around the edges but the message of trying to be a better person in spite of who you were before would be good for anyone to hear. They do it in such a hilarious way making it very entertaining.
3,Had to purchase season series 1-4 seperately for best value,Had to purchase seperately for best value???Had to purchase seperately for best value???Had to purchase seperately for best value???Had to purchase seperately for best value???Had to purchase seperately for best value???Had to purchase seperately for best value???
4,Good season but my least favorite so far.,"My Name Is Earl Season 3 is much different than the first two seasons. It begins where season two left off where Earl takes the fall for Joy's crime and ends up in prison. The better half of Season 3 takes place inside of the prison which in my opinion kinda slows down the series a bit. I only say that because the show relies heavily on the ""List"" and with Earl being in prison and all the show had to take a step in a different direction. Not necessarily a bad thing though. Shorty after Earl gets his freedom back he gets frustrated with ""Karma"" because he feels cheated of a reward from all the good things he's done with his list. Earl starts acting like his old self and quickly karma hits him with a car once again which leads him into a coma. Season 3 is still great, don't get me wrong but I feel It's a tad bit weaker than the first 2."
4,Carl Sandburg's Abraham Lincoln,Very good history of Lincoln's war years. Some of more recent books are more interesting reading.

2,Destruction Complete!,"After firing Ross Valory and Steve Smith, Steve Perry produced what essentially sounded like a Steve Perry solo album. If you love 80s cheesy synths and robotic percussion then this is for you. If however, you were a fan from the pre-Perry days, this represented the complete demise of the original spirit of the band. Although this record leans toward R&B, Perry, stadium rock god that he was, was no Sam Cooke and the music lacks authenticity. ""Be Good to Yourself"" reminds of past glories, but ""Suzanne"" is painful and plastic."
4,Journey....We Have A Problem,"Even though this re-release sounds better than previous ones, at the beginning of the first song, ""Girl Can't Help It"", a split second of the very first drum beat is missing. Overall, the CD is excellent especially with the added tracks. If you like your recordings of studio music to be prefect like I do in most cases, then this re-release is not for you. Find one used that was recorded from the master properly."
5,Journey - Raised on Radio,I LOVE Journey - so how could this possibly have been anything other than dewvine ??
2,Destruction Complete,"After firing Ross Valory and Steve Smith, Steve Perry produced what essentially sounded like a Steve Perry solo album.

""Be Good to Yourself"" reminds of past glories, but ""Suzanne"" is painful and plastic."
4,Mixed bag,"This CD has a few really good songs on it and some that are just okay--if anyone but Steve Perry was singing them (other than maybe Lou Gramm), they would be mediocre, but Perry could sing through the phone book and make it sound great. I don't think this is Journey's best effort--the production is uninspired on several tracks, but again, there is a handful of great tunes that are very well done. I'd buy it again."
5,Raised on Radio ~ rock & soul,"Raised on Radio is a magical mix of early 80s power pop, soulful R&B, and classic rock. Like all of Journey's albums, the songs run the gamut of human emotions, but with more maturity and worldly experience than earlier Journey albums From the bittersweet ""Girl Can't Help It"", a catchy pop song with an edge that sounds better with each listen... to the upbeat rocker ""Be Good To Yourself"", that makes you want to do just that... to the sincere affection of ""Happy To Give"" to the romantic rapture of ""Why Can't This Night Go On Forever."" And the title track that for those of us who were Raised on Radio sums up the spirit of this underrated record. Steve Perry has never sounded better... and for a man called ""The Voice"" that's saying something. His still soaring but often raunchier vocals are front and center and Neal & the rest of the band backs him up brilliantly. A great album!"
5,"A good read, except if you're on an airplane.","This is one book that is fun to read if you've seen the James Stewart movie about a scientist who believes a new type of airplane has a basic defect and will crash after so many hours in the air.Visualizing the well-cast actors as you read makes the book more interesting. The plot is well laid out and even though you know basically that the hero will be vindicated in his beliefs, it keeps your interest to the end."
3,A chilling adventure about aircraft design,"A Raindeer airplane crashes in Labrador after a little less than 1440 flying hours. In the official report the accident is ascribed to pilot error but Denis Scott at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough is not convinced that this explanation is true. Neither does Theodore Honey, a slightly eccentric member of Scott's staff, who has an as yet unproved theory that the tail plane of the Raindeer is bound to succumb to metal fatigue after 1440 hours in the air. What if Honey's experiments prove him to be right?"
4,Neville Shute's No Highway,Arrived as expected. It was great to find such an old book in such used condition -- obviously lots and lot of folks have enjoyed this story!
1,The Red Balloon and White Mane,"I bought these movies for my grandkids and although they loved "" The Snowman"" we found ""The Red Balloon and White Mane"" very distrubing. They haven't wanted to watch it again. Dissappointed in these 2 movies. I cannot recommend them."
4,Certaintly not your average hollywood comedy flick,"Gaudi Afternoom is what you could call an alternative piece of comedy . Set and filmed entirely in Spain , the movie is sharp , witty and full of dark humour . More of a film-noir if you'd like to categorize it , it's been carried by a group of talented , underrated female actors . Davis is excellent in the lead role and so is Marcia Gay Harden ( in her most unusual part yet ) who is been provided with more than a couple of poisonous lines to work on by the script . The female versus...""female"" scenes are all great yet the best one of all is when Harden and Taylor try to convince a little girl that they can compromise with each other and get over their differences , all in return for her precious love . Certaintly not your ordinary hollywood comedy flick , this spicy film waits for you to discover ."
4,Gaudi Afternoon - a quirky comedy for the broadminded,"Gaudi Afternoon is a quirky comedy with some joyful acting performances, set amongst some of Gaudi's architectural masterpieces in Barcelona. The plot twists and turns, as, it seems, do the sexual preferences, as the film progresses. Reminiscent of a comedic whodunnit, it's a where is he/she rather than a who killed him/her for the reluctant heroine. Perfect for a light and entertaining rainy afternoon."
2,interestingly different,"It's very interesting, in that the major roles, with one exception, are female. Having a female play a sex-changed male is unusual too. I would have enjoyed knowing why the translator was alienated from her mother. I did enjoy the movie. It was refreshing to have a mystery in which no one was in serious danger."
2,Judy Davis is very good - the rest is so-so,"Judy Davis is very good, but I lost interest in the story and the other characters about halfway through, but I did see the rest, thanks to Judy Davis. My wife and I both thought the whole thing was just so-so. Saw it on TV, and have now erased it."
1,Poor quality recording and cheesy sound effects,"What a disappointment. I think the sound effects may have been recorded with a microphone. Some of the tracks are so low that you can't hear them at all (yes, my computer's volume is cranked all the way up). It actually sounds like they took some recordings from other sound-effects CDs--not sure who stole from who, but it does say they're copyright-free!"
4,Great CD!,"Definitely one of my favorite rap cd's, Back in Business still doesn't bore me. The songs have some of the best beats, although it is true that all the lyrics could be summed up by ""I'm cool, you suck"". There's just a lot of great sounding tracks on here. I would really recommend it to anyone."
3,and they don't stop!!,I liked it. I can't complain. E Double and Parrish never falter in making real strong rap for the true heads!!
2,Bad Business,"I made the mistake buying this album after listening to ""Never Seen Before"" off the Def Jam's How to Be a Player Soundtrack. Never have I heard such repetitive beats. And the lyrics? Check it: ""Who want it?/Come and see me like 112/And I'll rock the bell with Fox and L"", said Erick in ""Da Joint"". Wack rhymes like this suggest that Erick and Parrish got back together only to make dollars and not good music. To tell you the truth, they remind me of an old-school Big Tymers. If you wanna peep their REAL skills, buy every album they made before this one."
1,Nope,I listened to All EPMD albums and it is clear that this album was thrown together just to clear their contract obligations to make 2 more albums. It's that bad. One a couple of track are worth listening to and those are played on the radio.I know i gave it one star but that is because i can't give them any less. EPMD are WAY better than this. don't waste your money.Aaron J. Creagh
2,Don't bother,"Please-some one needs to teach the ""rappers"" how to rap. They say nothing in the whole CD that makes sense or is worth listening to. Beats are alright. Bottem line- don't do what I did, save your $13."
5,Great,"I haven't read any of the ones after this, and this is the one when Tash uses the force to help her buddies. Doesn't DV figure out that Tash knows the Force in this one? I can't remember. Good book for people who are fans of Tash or Hoole, the other characters are squeezes in there for a part."
1,Timex watch,The alarm is very difficult to set & to see. You have to have very good ears to hear the alarm sound.
2,It will just induce more depression,"Overall proably one of the worst books ive ever read in my entire life. No wonder why so many people suffer from Depression. This is half the battle. Terrible advice (such as eating chocalate and being happy). I respect the fact that it does break some stuff down, but it again doesnt answer many vital questions that a depressed person would like to know.There were a few good sentences in this book. But a lot of it didnt get emphaised well. Once again, it seems to be another book that has been corrupted on these topics."
1,Stupid Name!!,"I can't believe they actually named the book ""Depression for Dummies"". Is that really the message we want to send to someone who is depressed? Stupid title for what ended up being an egg-headed solution to a problem that really can't be solved. The dummy is the guy who thought this book was a good idea."
5,Depression for Dummies,This is an excellent book in teaching you what depression is all about and the various types of help that is out there (from self-help to doctors). It is easy to read and I recommend it for anyone who has depression or knows someone with depression.
4,YOU NEED IT,MOST FOLK DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DEPRESSION INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE DEPRESSED. THIS BOOK DOES A GREAT JOB EXPLAINING DETAILS ABOUT DEPRESSION. HELP YOU TO STOP BEATING UP ON YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ARE THE WAY YOU ARE. GREAT FOR FAMILY MEMBERS THA ARE TRYING TO HELP SOMEONE EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION DEAL WITH IT.
4,Depression for Dummies,"This book is excellent for explaining the difficulties of depression, butand also giving solutions that are workable. I found it very easy to read and understand."
2,Thank God its over,"Finally, the Dante project of Edgar Froese has come to an end. Paradiso is the final set of disks to this project and I would not call it a Tangerine Dream album. It is an Edgar Froese album, pure and simple. Jerome is not on the disk and he is SORELY missing. This album lasts an eternity and rarely has any spark, fire, or energetic emotion. I can see why Jerome wanted no part to this debacle. He did not appear at any of the performances of Paradiso.There are a couple of good tracks on Paradiso but the incredible lenghth of this album (2+ hours!) will mean that it hardly ever gets listened to.The synths that are so characteristic of Tangerine Dream are virtually absent as there is an orchestra that are the main performers. I really would not have guess that this was Tangerine Dream had I not known in advance.Hopefully, they can recover from this and regroup with Jerome to produce something better."
1,Outrageously mean!,"Man,this movie is bad. This is not even a guilty pleasure, a horror flick that can make you laugh due to extremely bad production. No, none of that. This is plain mean, some of the worst that movies can ""offer"".In fact, it's a mystery how such useless piece of celluloid managed to:1) Obtain sponsorship and money to produce it;2) Obtain a distributing deal;3) Persuade actors to accept such stupid roles;4) Manage to be released in DVD, instead of being sheleterd forever;"
4,AN ORIGINAL HORROR MOVIE!,THIS MOVIE DESERVES SOME RESPECT. IT FEATURES SOME OF THE MOST UNIQUE MURDER SEQUENCES EVER SEEN IN HORROR SLASHER MOVIES. I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE AND I THOUGHT THE STORY WAS VERY GOOD.WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?
1,Not another SCREAM wannabe,Well nothing is new about this movie.Once you see the opening murder scene you know its going to be another SCREAM clone.
2,Terrible Slasher Pic,"Very lame ""scary"" teen movie. However, if you are a James McAvoy fan what the Heck.."
1,COOL ATMOSPHERE AT LEAST 1.5/5,The Pool is actually pretty decent considering the loads of bad movies these days. I guess this German made film learned from some other films mistakes. The movie is about a group of kids partying after High School Graduation and deicide on an upscale indoor pool which unknowingly lurks a killer. The plot is unoriginal but the atmosphere is nice and the waterslide scene is decent. I WOULD SUGGEST RENTING IT AT LEAST FOR A LAUGH!
2,All teenagers out of the pool!,"I love slasher films and will forever love slasher films, but there are some that you want to remember a little more than others. My case in point ""sleepaway camp "" classic and gets better more times you watch it but ""the pool"" on the other hand of which this is true not the worst of the slasher genre but far from the best in the crop of so many horror titles having a mask wearing pyscho.The acting not all that bad but the plot drags so much you find yourself wanting to fast forward to when the good stuff starts.This feels like any movie you have seen a 100 times before it's way to predictable and the character development is terrible even for a slasher film .It does have one memorable killing on the covered water slide but other then that not much going on here that has not been done to death and fails miserably!If this would have taken place at a public pool not even the lifeguard would have wanted to save this dud of a slasher!"
2,Friday The 13th In A Rec Centre,"This is the typical B grade slasher pic that rips off Friday The 13th. It's basicly putting Jason Voorhees (A guy in a mask with a machette knife) into a situation where he can slaughter a bunch of college grads who have broken into a rec centre for the graduation party.The acting is mostly terrible, the scares are stupid, the horror is not there, and the chill factor is in the minus 10 area. About the only kill in the movie that was any good was one of the kids coming down a water slide...but it didnt show anything memorable for the effect to work to its maximum potentiol.Ya might wanna rent it to laugh at how bad it is, but otherwise, dont bother with it, you're not missing anything special."
1,10 000 times already seen !,"If you already know the movies : Friday the 13th,Halloween,Scream and the thousand others that have been released since 1980, well just forget about The Pool ! There is nothing New in this movie.The story could have been written on a Postal stamp so much there is nothing to say about it.The teenagers are like usual, idiots listening typical Punk Rock music.The plot ... Is there one in it ? The (BAD) actors are killed one by one and the final survivors even if all their friends have been sliced few minutes before,they still smile and make bad jokes at the end.Avoid this movie ! Just re-watch one of the old flicks,they are funnier or at least a bit creepy."
1,very unsatisfied customer,This video was so scratched it wouldnt even play in my dvd players I tried all 4 of them. I buy used videos all ther time and was very unhappy with the condition of this dvd. I ordered the pool from another vender. I did not return this dvd because the shipping was more than the dvd is worth a very unsatisfied customer
5,Great Bra,"Muat Have !! This give me great support and a great look, I would recommend this to a friend.My husband loves it as well"
3,It's nice but....,"Good quality, really sexy but it's not just working for. I have really pointy nipples and they stick out when I wear them. Not the bra's fault though, I should have considered that when I was making my choice. It's lovely but I have to figure out a way to ""work it""."
4,"say yeah yeah, say yeah","bobby byrd was good solo, james brown sidekick for many years, best known for his collaborations with james though, even though james does cameo's on this, this is not a bad cd,james could have did these songs himself well at least half of them, includes i know you got soul which was heard in a million rap songs between 1988-1992. man james whole catalog was sampled to death."
4,enjoyable,"I don't think this is the worst Jennifer Crusie book, far from it. It's exactly what all the rest of her books are - fun, exciting, interesting, sexy and funny. This one did remind me more of Crazy for You than any other because the the characters and the entire story is pretty down-to-earth and it's just everyday situations for all of the characters. She describes a life that could be anyone's and often is.Great book. Fun read. Enjoy it."
4,Fun Reading!,"Jennifer Crusie has a knack for fun and witty language! I read this story in 1 1/2 days. I was glad that, for a change, Cal, the gorgeous hunk was attracted to Minerva, a big boned woman who was not the typical dainty, naive and delicate girl even if he was pushed to notice her only because of a bet!"
4,"Enjoyed it, but the ending was a let down","""Bet Me"" was a fun read. It took me a few times to get into it. I guess I was not in the mood. But it was an enjoyable read. I loved ALL the main characters. I was kind of mad at first that the relationship between Cal and Min started on a bet, but the longer they knew each other it seemed like real love bloomed. Cal was a great catch, and I thought Min was a girl who deserved him.I was not real happy with the ending. I thought more could have been put into what happened to all of them instead of just a few lines. I grew to like all of them, and felt let down on their ""futures"". Out of all of Jennifer Crusie books, this was one of the better."
4,Bet Me Review,Jennifer Crusie always creates great characters and this book has them too. I didn't find the theme as exciting as some of her other books but it is a good read. Still has twists and turns to keep you reading.
1,Ho-Hum and a rant,"After I read Bet Me, I thought 'been there, done that. ' It seems like the author combined 'Fast Women' and 'Welcome to Temptation,' and threw in some new music (Elvis) and fairy tale stuff. There's the little kid and the baseball game, the three tight women friends, someone gets hit with something, the frozen mother and so on. And speaking of the frozen mother, it would be so nice to see this author portray a woman in her fifties as something other than an ice matron or manipulative or frozen or unfulfilled or incomplete or dead below the waist. When you think about some of her older female characters (Gwen, Liz, Nanette, Cal's mother, Maddie's mother) Crusie seems to perpetuate these stereotypes of the woman over fifty."
1,Never met a Crusie book I didn't like - until now,"I found BET ME to be a big disappointment. Populated by cardboard characters, it lacks charm and wit. I hope she's getting paid by Krispy Kreme because it's mainly a glorified ad for them."
1,Bet Me,This was one of the most boring books I've ever read. The story line is/could be cute but the writing is horrible. Too many he said / she saids and details that don't help to develop the characters.
2,I could have waited for the paperback,"If I had friends and family like Min, I would have told them where to go long ago. I found it hard to believe that a 33 yr. old female put up with so much from them.I usually love most of Crusie's books but this was not a favorite. I didn't like most of the characters and thought they were nuts."
2,terribly predictable,"I started the book thinking it would be a great escape from reality. Well, it was and it wasn't. It seemed as though the author was trying to write both Bridget Jones's Diary and Sex and the City...but she didn't quite pull off either. Don't get me wrong, it was a somewhat enjoyable fantasy book, however, I am not going to suggest it to any of my friends."
4,I was hooked!,"I'm not a big fan of romance novels. However, I couldn't put this book down and I lost a few hours of sleep trying to find out how Cal and Min were going to end up. Because Crusie writes from both characters' POV, you really root for them because you know what's REALLY going on. Some of the events were a little far fetched, but it just added to the fairy tale part of the story.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story. Be prepared to lose some sleep because you just can't put this book down."
5,Crazy Tension,"Rather than retelling the plot, I'll focus my short comments on my reaction/review of the novel:I really enjoyed this novel with all of its sauciness and sexual tension. This book, more than any others I've read in awhile, really builds the chemistry between the two characters so that you can't put it down! If you're wanting some good, escapist reading, this is a good choice."
5,Makes you want to start your own snowglobe collection,"'Bet Me' is an absolute, hands-down all-time favorite. While it can easily be categorized as ""chick-lit,"" this story is so much more than that. It's fun, light and airy, has funny, well-meaning, and meddling secondary characters (the couple's friends), a pair of hate-worthy exes, and some very memorable lines from the first page right up to the last. While comedy-romance may not be for everyone, this is one of Crusie's best works and worth at least one read. Just don't be surprised when you fall in love with Min and Cal, too!"
3,More Chick Lit,"Reading the reviews, I was sooo excited about this book. It's nice, silly, typical chick lit, but too many things annoyed me about it.First, it's just too long. The 'ole cat & mouse game only goes on for so long, especially when nothing else is happening in this plot.Min & Cal have a colorful array of friends, but very little character exploration is done with them. It makes you re-read dialogue between them because nothing has stood out between the pack.I recommend the movie ""Down With Love"" if you like this book. It reminded me a lot of the movie, only I liked the movie much better.Don't get me wrong- I did enjoy a lot of the book. Min's character is real & great! I really dig that strange cat, Elvis, too. She & Cal are fun to read as they go at it. Their fights are silly & funny, yet witty & intelligent.This is my first time reading Cruise & because I found some really good elements to this novel, I think I'll try her again."
3,Wrong demographic?,"The story is cute, and I laughed aloud a couple of times, but I wish I'd read this when I was about 18. I think I would have appreciated it more then. I'd draw the analogy to a Julia Roberts movie...entertaining, but you're almost dumber for having partaken. At 18 I wouldn't have minded the lack of character development, I wouldn't have minded the cartoonish supporting characters. (...)But at my age (...) I feel like this book was wasted on me because it is a silly and superficial, albeit cute, story. And for heaven's sake, where was Jennifer Cruise on the day they taught conversational writing in school? Playing hooky and stuffing her face with Chicken Marsala? After the first chapter, I was already fed up with the ""he said...she said...he said...she said...he said..."" How about ""he retorted,"" or ""she replied?!?"" (...)"
3,It was good,"I didn't love this and I didn't hate it. Maybe it was the fact that they kept eating the same meal over and over and I just wanted to scream arn't you sick of that yet, maybe its because instead of a dog they had a cat and I don't like cats, maybe it was just that Min was not the best and she complained to much. Min is an overwieght woman who agrees to go on a date with Cal despite knowing, or thinking that he is only dating her for a bet. They can't seem to aoid each other since her best friend and his best friend decide that after meeting each other they have found their soulmate and their other two friends are sort of seeing each other to. The story makes the reader question fairy tales, who we see ourselves as and how that determains what kind of life and the hapiness we'll find."
1,Did we read the same book?,"This book was so ridiculous I couldn't finish it. The bar scenes the pick-up lines the author described were so trite and phony I felt like it must have been a flash-back to Studio 54. I honestly don't think the author has ever experienced the bar/pick-up/dating scene. It felt as though she was writing about what she thought it would be like and certainly not from any personal experience. I found the situations so unbelievable I laughed out loud. Do some research next time, Ms. Cruise because believe me you are way off base here. I gave it one star because I liked the cover. Read The Devil Wears Prada or the Nanny Diaries instead."
1,All Bets Off,"Maybe it's me, but I do not like men who bet, even jokingly, as to whether they'll get a woman in bed. That pretty much blew it for me."
5,How could anyone not love it?,"This is my favorite Jennifer Cruisie book of all time. The characters of Min and Cal are so relatable, so real, and yet their story is like wish fufillment personified. Who wouldn't identify with Min? A slightly overweight, average-looking woman with a great sense of humor, plenty of intelligence, and many of the same self-esteem issues and fears that every woman faces. And who wouldn't want a man like Cal? Gorgeous, funny, sweet, successful, but not without flaws and self-esteem issues of his own. This book had the trademark Cruisie humor, a low-key but fun plot, and enough sweet, romantic moments to make even a cynic sigh a time or two. Oh, and also, if you're a fan of Krispy Kreme donuts, and have perchance, a time or two, fantasized about oh, bathing in a tub of them or being hand fed them by a gorgeous guy between kisses . . . then you have found the book you've been waiting for all your life. Enjoy!"
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!,"I'm 23, I absoloutley LOVED this book. I usually only get Susan Elizabeth Phillips books, my fav. author, and stumbled upon this one. I can't wait to read her other books. A must buy! Especially for curvy girls :)"
5,Hilarious,"Listened to the audio version. I planned to only listen to it my car, but ended up grabbing my headphones and finished it off over the weekend. I laughed myself silly.The main character is witty, overweight, and beautiful! You will love her."
2,Ridiculous,"This book is so lame. I bought the Kindle version out of the rave review and the cheap price, but I couldn't believe I was reading a crap like this. It's full of cliche and unrealistic plots and characters. I love reading romance and enjoy watching romantic comedy movie, so I understand it can sometimes consist some coincidences and events just to add that romantic spice. And I think this book has a good potential to go on a movie if it were not so ridiculous and stupid. The characters are one dimensional and the entire story is surrounded with a silly bet, which is alright if the author can develop more depth on her story. The lines just keep jumping from Cal and Min and their silly friends, with coincidences and trashy comments. I gave it two stars for its sometimes funny lines, but other than that this book is totally waste of time. I would have gone for Sophia Kinsella over this."
2,Very fattest,"I know I am a very small minority here, but I did not like this book. I found the characters to be flat and boring.Min's food fetish was annoying and, I must say, somewhat offensive. Why is it that the character without the perfect body is obsessed with food and has low self esteem? Is it not possible for a chubby woman to have interests that do not involve taste.Other than the job, which was purely background, Min did nt have a whole lot going for her. Did she travel? What kind of books did she read? Did she have any interests at all? I think her friend was right in saying that she brought nothing to the relationship with Cal.Cal was o.k., though he suffered a similar lack of character development. We know that he is gorgeous and likes to hit and run, but what else has he got?The writer did not show enough of either character to get me truly invested.I do not regret reading this book, but it was my first and last by this author."
4,A Dose of Happy,"I love Jennifer Crusie's writing style and basically have brought all her books, even the older ones. This book was a return to the classic romantic tale with a modern fairy tale thrown in. I had pre-ordered this book and was not disappointed.I did not give it 5 stars because I am one of those women who likes my books to end with a husband, wife and kids. I know not every woman needs kids to be happy, but I just can't help it, I like my novels to end that way.Other than that very tiny preference, I loved this book. The hardcover price did not bother me at all, it was worth it. I am really looking forward to more of her books."
3,Very disappointing,"I found Bet Me to be a huge disappointment. There were no quirky, funny secondary characters in this book like there had been in her others. All of the characters were lacking depth and fire. Even Jennifers' usual great dialogue was flat. From the moment the book started, you knew the ending, but there were never any curveballs thrown in along the way. And 3/4 of my way through the book, I still didn't feel any real chemistry between Min and Cal. Min is described as everything from being full figured to fat, but Cal seduces her with food every step of the way and uses Krispy Kreme donuts to tease her. What is sexy about that? I wanted to scream at her ""Run for your life - you will die of a coronary before your 40th birthday if you stay with the guy!"" If you want to read a fun Jennifer Crusie book - buy Welcome to Temptation or Faking It instead!"
1,Very poor ebook transcription,"Although I am enjoying this story, the transcription errors that riddle this ebook version are driving me crazy. ""I'm"" routinely comes through as ""F'm"" or ""T'm"". There are many other typos that appear to be the result of scanning the book and then failing to check the spellings that resulted. This indicates lousy quality control. The publisher should be ashamed, and Ms. Crusie should demand better treatment of her work."
2,"Cute story, but...","This was an engaging, light read. Crusie is good at writing snappy dialogue, but I could not get past her choice to give her 2 leading characters the very old-fashioned names- Minerva and Calvin! I kept imagining my grandparents, which frankly is not a picture you want in your head when you're reading a romance novel!"
1,Very Very Disappointed,"I am such a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie, I have read all her books with true giddy excitment. Unfortunately this book did not give me that feeling, it was so bad I started to skim through the book, I have never done that with a Crusie book before. I almost felt like crying that was how upset I was with this book, I have re-read all her books several times, so me saying one of her books are bad is very tragic. I know I must sound so dramatic, but she is my favorite author and I feel I have been let down. I hate to say this but I will be very cautious about going out and buying her next book."
5,On my top 10 list!,"This is one of my favorite books ever! The characters are fabulous! The story is fun and funny and moving. I read it, loved it! Read it again, loved it more!!!"
3,I was okay.,"I don't remember much about the story, but I remember I did enjoy it. So as far as I know, it was just okay."
2,Didn't flow,The story started off ok but it didn't take long for me to wish it would hurry up and be over. Just could not get committed to the story or the characters.
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,"This is the first Jennifer Crusie book I've read, and it will definately NOT be the last. I could not put this book down. Not only were the characters on a whole, witty, well-written, and real, but the star of the show for once is not a little bitty perfect woman with ""slim hips and a narrow waist"". Min Dobbs is built like a real woman -- she is not a toothpick -- and through the book both she and others recognize her beauty.Cal Morrisey is every woman's dream guy and the chemistry created between he and Min is electric. The interactions between the two had me laughing out loud. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever played the dating game. It will make you believe in true love and fairy tales all over again."
5,terrific book ~ VERY funny ~ I loved it!,Minerva and Cal. Bets. Love in the air. Friction erupts. Hilarious writing. Need I say more? Get this one! It's a winner.
4,Argh... Chicken Marsala!!!,"I like this Jennifer Crusie book. Her main characters weren't perfect and yet still found their prince charmings. I felt that she did a good job connecting Min's weight issues to the insecurities in all of us. I was sick of Chicken Marsala by the end of the book. I agree with other write-ups that this book was not her very best. From the inside cover, I got the feeling that it wasn't Ms. Crusie's favorite either. Even still, she never dissappoints me. She is an outstanding writer."
3,Not her best work,"Generally speaking, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Crusie's books. That being said, I was a bit disappointed in her latest work. While the references to Krispy Kreme doughnuts were funny (to a point), it seems as though Min would have straightened her mother out a long time ago regarding her food choices and her weight. I also agree with some of the other reviews that this isn't Crusie's best ensemble character development.Fun to read, but not as much fun as it could have been. Let's hope she goes back to her previous self in future novels."
4,"A winner, but not big time...","This book was a fun little romp, even though it offers no truly exciting plot or heart tugging emotion. It is the witty dialogue that keeps you reading. The hot love scene happens nearly at the end of the book, so you will need to have patience here."
3,Should have been a paperback original,"According to the author's website, this was an old unsold manuscript that was rewritten and updated, a la Dean Koontz. Although it is a fun book, it feels like an early effort, not up to the standards of Faking It or Fast Women. Wait for the paperback."
3,"Good, but slow and long at times","This is the first book I've read by Jennifer Cruise. I liked parts of the book, but other parts of it drove me crazy. There was some good dialogue, but the word said was over used. There were good parts and interaction between the characters, but there were a lot of long and drawn out scenes that slowed down the book. Several times during the book Cruise could have ended it, but it kept going. The frequency of betting was getting old also. I liked the relationship between Cal and Min, and thought Bonnie was amusing. David was a chump and towards the end I couldn't stand him or Cynthia. Pretty early on, almost from the beginning, the ending was predictable. I liked the ending, but actions by the family members didn't seem realistic. Overall it was all right, but would have been better if it had been shorter and quicker paced."
3,I figured out why its not great,"I am listening to the CD, after giving the book a quick read when it came out. The premise is great, but the dialog gets boring because its all ""xx""Cal Said then ""xx""Min Said ""xx""Bonnie said ""xxx""David Said. The word SAID must have been used 10,000 times in this book. It slows down otherwise snappy dialogue."
3,"Mildly amusing, but not much of a plot.","I have to agree with other reviewers that Ms. Crusie's last two efforts (BET ME and FAKING IT) have not been up to par with her usual standards of excellence. Although the characters are likeable and there are some witty lines, the book lacks any kind of plot. It consists mostly of couples pairing off in a singles bar. It reminds me of ""Seinfeld"" meets ""The Dating Game"" (which is not a compliment since I don't care for either show).Also, I felt the author threw in some things to try to please everyone. Min is overweight and carb conscious. The bartender (who is also Cal's neighbor) is a Lesbian. One couple decides to remain childless, which disappointed me because they both like children and it is pointed out a couple of times in the book that they would make beautiful children. I will continue to read Ms. Crusie's books, but hope for better in the future."
4,Reminded me of Bridget Jones Diary!,"This book came recommended to me and I have never read this author before. It is a quick read with witty dialogue. The plot line and relationship reminded me a little bit of ""Bridget Jones Diary"". The main character was interesting, but I never could really relate to her. It does describe the modern dating scene in detail (which looks a little scary to me - glad I'm not in that arena!) While I liked the book, I did not give it 5 stars because I like books with more intricate plots and greater character development. This is a good book for a quick read on vacation or on the week-end."
5,Great book,"Bet Me is the perfect lazy summer day at the beach read. It's top notch brain candy and if you prefer a book with more depth, you'll probably be disappointed. We all know how it's going to end, but it's one of those books that's impossible to put down. Go ahead and buy the book. I'll bet you you'll love Minerva, the lead character as much as I did."
4,Great Book - Horrible Editing,"Jennifer Crusie never disappoints and Bet Me is no exception. It's a lighthearted, entertaining book with interesting characters. The only problem is the editing on the Kindle edition - hundreds of errors, which was a little irritating. But if you can overlook those this is a great book at a decent price."
2,K&N Disapointment!,Very poor fit. I had to go to the hardware store to make my own mounting bolt that would work. Not worth it. Stay with the stock foam one.
3,gospel cd,"This cd was used.I am pleased with the cd, but the case was broken.I am over all pleased. Thanks,carson"
5,The Final Sessions,"I wasn't sure that this last cd was what I liked. I like old Gospels and this was all new. I finally bought it and I listened to it...beautiful! Better then the Elvis' Gospel Favorites. When I listened to number four the cd got another dimension, he's singing about his own death...he died in November 1998! If you like Gospel even when you don't believe like me you will fall in love with this cd!Erwin"
5,J.D. saves best for last,"I just bought and listened to this recording, the last by J.D. Sumner. I've been a big fan of his for years and I've heard most of his recordings. This one, The Last Sessions, is one of the best he ever did. I really like all of the songs, he sounds as good as ever. ""Ole Man Death"" is hard to listen to without getting choked-up, it is very touching. This CD is a fitting end to the long and wonderful career of J.D. Sumner. We do miss him."
4,Am I too harsh?,"As incredible as Sumner was, I found that a couple of tracks were a bit dull. Overall, it's a good recording, but not worthy of five stars in my book. Owning a copy would definitely enhance your music library."
5,Great combination of talent,This is a wonderful series - I would love to go on BUT I NEED region ONE - I need USA version - PLEASE
4,"Great, light-hearted British police procedure TV show","Interesting stories, interesting characters, not too much blood and gore, and BRITISH <!>. Recommended."
1,Wonderful DVD but Subtitles on discs 2 and 3 don't work,"I have fallen in love with ""New Tricks"" and ordered all available seasons. The #1 season cost a fortune through an outside vendor and on Amazon Prime. I am an older lady who is hard of hearing. The last two discs said there were subtitles but they wouldn't work and I couldn't hear the dialog. I sent it back and hope to someday get the #1 season without the price gouging. I am surprised Amazon does business with a company that charges so outrageously. I should have ordered from one of the other vendors and now probably will. Amazon is my most favorite place to purchase almost everything."
2,Acting Carries the Day,"Whomever is writing these stories is like a Twinkie manufacturer that produces a lot of nutritional fluff that is slightly filling to start out with but just as you get to the heart of the confectionary you find they left out the filling - it's just air. So these stories start out seemingly to fill you but when you get to the end, it just deflates like an empty Twinkie balloon. The writers do not know how to create a drama with a memorable, rather than forgettable finish. Each episode had a predictable, bland uncreative closure to it's plot.Two stars only because the acting and character portrayal, even though unrealistically off-the-wall, ends up holding the stories together. In particular, the dialogue portion of the script was typical British sarcastically spot on. As an aside, I miss the secretary officer, PC Clark after this first year because he portrayed the only rational, sensible police official."
4,New Tricks a show of cold cases,New Tricks a comedy and an action showIt was interestng to see the pilot of this show and it was well done as are all of the episodes. Slowly I hope to own alll of the episodes because I reallly enjoy watching them and I r ecommend them to any of my friends who are into British police programs.
5,"New Tricks,new Brit police drama","""New Tricks"" is a very well done police drama .We did not enjoy the first 2 episodes but became ""hooked"" while watching the 3 rd,so much so that we purchased the entire series from Amazon.com"
2,Ye gods,"The worst record I have heard this year. The guy I bought it from sold it because he couldn't stand it. Even the Princeton Record Exchange won't take it.It's not even well-recorded. Or interesting ... even though it seems like it should be, what with Richard Stoltzman's clarinet interacting with percussion and all."
5,J'ai rencontré le Père Nol,This is a wonderful film (and not just because I sang on the soundtrack). The story is beautiful and touching. I saw it when I was 8 years old and I still remeber it fondly. A great film for all the family.
2,Photo doesn't match the product,The photo does not match the product because of that I had to buy two stone guards instead of one which was what I really needed. Besides this mistake the product is OK and matched the original grills.
4,Ashley rules!,Very fun movie. Four kids discover a strange stone in the woods and it unlocks a special power in each one of them. Of course the hot chick's gotta turn bad and she's sweet! A lot of fun. It reminded me of 'The Craft.'I can't help but wonder what power the glowing stone would give to me. . .
1,Cool Cover Art...,"unfortuneately, that's the best thing about this movie. The special effects are lame. The acting is subpar, some of which can be blamed on the director (very poor camera angles). How people gave it a 5-star is beyond me. Must be friends and relatives of the cast. For a low-budget film, I might consider it a 2-star. But, I just had, had to bring down that 3 1/2 overall rating. Movies rated that highly should offer much, much more regardless of budget constraints. I'm spending good money and want to be assured that when a film gets a decent review that it offers good entertainment in return. This one did not. Sometimes it's best to listen to those 1 & 2 star reviewers. That was the case here."
1,The Worst Movie EVER,"Like with this review, don't waste your time. I give this a Negative 10 (-10) on a scale of 1 to 10, It must have taken a week to shoot the movie and about a thousand dollar budget. This movie reminded me of the ""Tela Tubbies."" Graphics = F, Acting = F-, Story Line = C+, Would I watch again? Hmmmmmm, NO. Don't waste your time watching this movie unless your in dire need of a nap."
1,Surge protection needed please.............,Worse movie ever. I wish I could think of any redeeming qualities but I can't.There was only one sympathetic character and his whiney attitude soon made me want to punch him in the face. I ended up punching myself in the face for even renting it.All of the other characters were so very unlikeable that I couldn't care less what happened to them.The actual 'surge' power source was cartoonish.I recommend passing this one by. I wish I would have.
2,To dull,I seem to be good at picking poor movies from the past. Oh well don't know if you don't try.
3,do they make C movies?,"Made for teenagers, I wondered at times if it was made by teenagers too. I did enjoy it though (for some reason I can't fully explain). The actors were solid. Story? Eh, I've seen better in worse movies. High School girls perhaps? yeah, they're cute too, but I think there's a darkness to it that people liked. If it were on cable, and your a male between 12 and 25, you'd probably leave it on. All in all, it doesn't have alot of substance but was entertaining. Glad I rented."
1,Yikes! I should have read reviews,"Because this is an Apple product, I didn't read the reviews carefully. Didn't expect serious problems.The big issue: Because I am right-handed like most people, the cord does not reach the plug on my MacBook Pro, unlike every other mouse I've used! No where did I notice this limitation in the Amazon product description. I work faster with a mouse than with the Pro's trackpad.Now that I've tried this mouse more than a month after receiving it, it's probably too late to send it back and probably too much of a nuisance."
2,Apple Mighty Mouse,"I've had three Mighty Mouses for my iMac, and after this last one, I decided no more. They all work just fine until they get dirty and quit working. Apple, in their infinite wisdom and greed, made these so that they can't be cleaned without breaking into them and dealing with the incredibly intricate interior components, and then putting them back together with Super Glue. So when it happened this last time, I just went out to OfficeMax and bought a wired Logitech m110 for $17.11 (incl tax). It works just fine, plus is hugely cost effective, considering what Apple charges for their Mighty Mouse. This is the first time since 1984 that I've encountered an Apple product that sucks--I hope this isn't a trend."
1,"Shipped on ""the slow boat from China""!","Although 321 Express (where this item was ordered) told they are located in Oregon, this item took 3 weeks and one day to arrive in Michigan BECAUSE it arrived directly from Beijeng China in a mailing envelope with no paper work, and no manufacturer's number on the item. The roller ball on the Mighty Mouse does not move the scroll bar to the left as it should. I would never have ordered from this 321 Express [ironic name] had I known ahead of time how long it would take. Who would have dreamed it was going to be shipped directly from China? The shipping was only $4.99, but we did not know that would put our item on ""the slow boat from China"". The shipping time was not known until AFTER the order was placed. We ordered from this company because it had the best price. The lower price was not worth the wait, for a partially [?] DEFECTIVE Mighty Mouse. I will never buy from 321 Express again. VKJ"
3,"Nice, but track wheel is still a problem","I like this mouse and the way it feels and works except that this is now the third one I have owned and all three have had problems with the track wheel going out and not scrolling. Just purchased the magic mouse and have been more happy with it up to this point. I didn't think I would like the feel of the slimmer design but so far, the magic mouse way out does the mighty mouse with one exception. It does not have the double buttons on the side."
1,This is an awful product,"This is simply an awful product. Even the reviews on the MAC website concur with this opinion.The problems are numerous: the cord is too short, the right-click button is difficult to consistently find/use, the scroll button broke after two months, and the two side buttons have NO USE whatsoever. In fact, the two side buttons take so much effort to press, I only used them a couple days because my wrist was becoming sore.This is a product that should be avoided at all costs. The scroll button breaking issue has been reported by numerous users on reviews here and on MAC - this is not a fluke. I have nothing good to say about this product except that it looks nice.... but I'd take an ugly functional mouse over a pretty poorly-designed mouse any day."
2,"Love the scroll ball, hate the second ""button""","It's nice to see Apple finally moving toward two-button mice, but this just isn't the answer. Maybe it is just my hands, but I find it impossibly hard to separate the left and right mouse button. More often than not I am right-clicking when I try to left-. It practice it means I keep doing stupid stuff like removing elements from the Safari toolbar when all I want to do is click.Mine is now collecting dust in favor of a traditional two-button mouse.I do, however, really miss the scroll ball. I know many do not, but for me a normal wheel seems hamstrung once you've used the ball on the mighty mouse."
1,"Painful to use, and the scroller gets stuck.","This is hands down the worst mouse I've ever used. I'm a programmer at a design agency, so we all use Macs, including this mouse. Repeatedly using this mouse over many hours cramps my hand, wrist, and shoulder on my right side. I recently worked overtime on a Flash website, and at the end of the deadline my hand was so cramped it was painful to extend my first finger.Aside from the less than optimal mouse shape, the biggest problem is the scroll dot. The more use your mouse gets, the more likely it is to stick so you can't scroll at all. You can unstick it by holding the mouse upside down and vigorously rolling the ball in all directions. However, despite doing that regularly, I still have problems scrolling up with it. It takes more force to scroll up now, which cramps your hand and stresses your wrist.I do not recommend this mouse for anybody who uses a computer more than a few hours a day."
5,this thing is amazing,"so i went to the apple store to buy one but they were all sold out. i did test one out though. it is amazing.those other people say you need to lift your hand up and whatnot to use the right click and the scroll ball. that isnt true. if you need to do that, then you are using it wrong. plain and simple.its very easy to operate and the scroll ball function is amazing. also i like how the side buttons can open up the dashboard or whatever else youd like it to.all in all, this is probably one of the most innovative consumer products ive ever used."
2,Mighty Lame,"The scroll ball is a good idea, and I enjoyed it while it lasted, but mine isn't working anymore after just 1 month. Otherwise, the mouse is ergonomically awkward, feeling more like a plastic potato rather than a computer device. The side buttons are touchy and can be accidentally triggered when moving the mouse. The mouse lacks a defined left and right button too, leaving you to control-click to get contextual menus.Here's a tip -- get a better designed, 2 button mouse with a scroll-wheel. If you need to scroll horizontally, press SHIFT on the keyboard, then use the scroll wheel. If it's all configured correctly, you can scroll horozontally through the window. Apple markets this mouse as the only one that lets you scroll horizontally, but this is not the case."
1,Absolute Crap,"Buy this product once, regret it for the rest of the time you own it. Yet another example from Apple of a beautiful piece of design with no regard for functionality. Scroll ball frequently fails, making using this $50 piece of garbage a blistering frustration. I'm using one right now and can't scroll at all, up or down. Right-clicks are often not recognized. You'll end up wanting to throw this thing out the window. Save yourself, your money, and your blood pressure. Avoid all Apple peripherals. They are famous for failing. IMO, this is yet another monumental abdication of responsibility to a loyal customer base. Strongly recommend boycotting this company until it acquires a conscience."
1,Absolute crap,"Wherever Apple's brand is connected with quality and good design, it won't hold here. A mouse is hardly -what you would call- the product of advanced engineering, yet Apple managed to produce something so useless, it resides on my desk with a scrollwheel, that was never meant to give you good grip, and that's now jammed. I won't even go into the details of randomly swapping clicks. Yes, i know Macs have no need for a right-click button. Should it not work properly then for only that reason?"
2,Better Wait!,"Hey, I feel this is like a BIG step back. I had already got used to a wireless mouse and then we have to go back to a corded one?Thanks but no thanks, It is so simple to make a wireless mouse that I have no doubt Apple (being so innovative???) should come up with one VERY soon... THEN I'll buy one! Meanwhile I'll continue to use my old Microsoft Intelli Mouse.Now I'm a little dissapointed."
1,not cool.,i bought this about a month ago and i'm sorry i did. when i use the scroll ball it always jumps me back to my previous page on the internet which gets very irritating after the tenth time in five minrtes especially when using firefox. highly unreccomended.
2,Not a two button mouse,"The product review claims, ""...detect where you're clicking, transforming your sleek, one-button mouse into a two-button wonder."" To use the right hand click on this mouse, one must remove the left part of your hand from the mouse or it will register as a normal click. This is extremely inconvenient. Next time Apple should try to make a true two button mouse or change the logic of their software. I shouldn't have to change how I use my mouse to accommodate a product with a UI flaw.-Opinion from a new mac user"
2,A real bummer,"I'm a big mac user, usually love their products, but I gotta say . . . this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment. Two reasons:1. The right-click/left-click technology has never worked.2. The scroller just stopped working today . . . after owning it for only a matter of months. I can no longer stroll down, just up and side-to-side.I've just ordered a new mouse."
2,Functional -- to a point,"I was excited about my Mighty Mouse, because I do a lot of horizontal scrolling.Downsides:The short cord (VERY short -- get an extension if you don't have a laptop) is a bit of a bummer, and the left/right click recognition is a bit messed up, and the side buttons are basically useless (I am unable to get my fingers into a comfortable position to use them)...Upside:That said, I still liked it. I like the programmable scroll button and the feel and size of the mouse. I like the quiet whirring the scroll ball makes when I spin it.Ultimate downside:So why 2 stars? Well, maybe mine's a fluke, but after two weeks of standard business use, my scroll ball has stopped working. I consider that unacceptable and it makes me think seriously about returning (not exchanging!) the product."
4,A great mouse,Mighty mouse is a simple and elegantly engineered mouse. I love the simple small scroll wheel and the lack of individual buttons takes a little getting used to but is pretty cool.
1,i hate this thing,"i'll keep this short:i hate this mouse....im using it right now. ive cleaned the ball twice this morning, and it still won't scroll. it worked fine for about two months, then the problems started. the two side buttons are useless and difficult to push in. it is overpriced and has never functioned right after those first two months."
4,No... It's not like the cartoon character.,"I love this mouse. it is so simple and easy to use. people complain that the side buttons are hard to press but they aren't. If you have Mac OS X 10.4.3 Tiger or above you don't have to install the drivers off the disc, just plug-n-play. When i first got it, i scrolled so much in Safari, i froze the app, a very hard thing to do. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because yesterday the scroll ball wouldn't scroll down but with a quick search on the apple discussion boards, i was able to get it working in no time."
1,Breaks alot,"I use this item at work. So far in the span of about 2 months, 2 of them have broken, meaning the middle ball stopped scrolling downward.Another complaint I have is that the left and right mouse click isn't reliable because they actually aren't separate buttons. Periodically the mouse also goes into spaz mode where it will autoclick by itself for long periods of time (up to a minute).I'm not impressed, and have to replace 2 mice now and will not purchase another unmighty mouse."
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly","Well, I was excited to get this mouse because I tried it in the store and the scrolling was awesome! The best I've ever seen. I vowed to never buy a corded mouse again, but I couldn't resist this.At first, I loved this. I even used USB Overdrive to reprogram the buttons to suit my needs (another reviewer must have missed this software...it works fine).But the side buttons are simply not place well, and not responsive enough. As another reviewer stated, I would stop what I was doing to focus on using these buttons, and don't really like them at all.But the main complaint is that, after a couple of months of use, this thing got whacky. Out of the blue, one of the buttons will stick, repeatedly sending out a ""click"" or ""right click"" or whatever button sticks. It sometimes happens when it's sitting unused and is a real pain. So much so that I'm sadly going to abandon it and go back to my next favorite mouse...the Logitech MX series."
3,"Great on a Mac, but not all buttons work on a PC","I bought an Apple Mighty Mouse for my Mac mini and love it. The trackball really saves on hand-strain by allowing me to control the scroll bars with the trackball.However, on a PC it is just not the same. It only supports standard PC mouse options. The trackball can only scroll up and down, not side to side. Also the squeeze option does not work.Jeff"
1,don't buy,The scroll wheel does not work. I am on my third one and it needs to be thrown out the window.This is a huge distraction from my day.
2,Scroll ball is a practical design flaw.,Pretty good mouse at first.We use this on a family computer that gets lots of use. The scroll ball is constantly out of order and it is just plain annoying to be dealing with fixing it all of the time.This seems like form over function problem.
3,Scroll button problems,"I also had problems with the scroll wheel. Seemingly without a reason, it stubbornly refuses to scroll down approximately every other day. Generally it is fixed by turning the mouse upside down and rolling the scroll button around very quickly, but today even this won't fix it. Other than that, the mouse is great, battery life is good, and it connects quickly to my iMac. I do not recommend it because of the frustration with the scroll button."
3,Ummmm Undecided as of yet.,"I have been using the apple pro mouse for over 3 years and thought I'd upgrade(?) to the newer model, the mighty mouse. I've had this about a week now. I do design work every day and am on my mac an average of 10 hours a day. Soooo far, I have had a really awkward time with the mighty mouse. It doesnt always seem to properly click and I have to re-click again. Seems like you have to have your fingers in the right spots for this to register properly. The side buttons are kinda in a weird spot also for me. It seem like most people have said, you almost have to train yourself to use this.If you have the pro mouse I'd recommend just sticking with that. I'm almost ready to get my pro mouse back out, if it weren't for the scroll ball I probably would. We'll see how it goes in a few weeks."
4,It's alright...,"It's good, but not perfect. the scroll wheel is convenient. the squeeze buttons are handy, but the right click/left click ""button"" takes some getting used to. It isn't intuitive to use. The cord length is a little short for right-handed users with powerbooks or ibooks (the usb port is on the left). It's functionable, but not the best mouse available for apple users.If possible, purchase this refurbished from the bargain bin at an apple store (last weekend of every month), or via the apple website."
3,Not Apple's Best work,"If I need anything computer related, I wouldn't even bother reading a review of Mac stuff as I have found it to be so good. This isn't the case with the Mighty Mouse. While it's good, it's not great. Sure enough the multidirectional scroll wheel is spot on and was pretty much the reason for me buying it but the invisible three button feature is not good. Distinction between left and right button click is not obvious and is very irritating if you change your hand position on the mouse. The side squeeze buttons are all but useless as they require about 100 newtons of force to get them to operate and are positioned way too high on the mouse. Also, I've not got huge hands and i find it a bit too big when I use it for long periods. The tracking is great and very accurate but skips a lot more than my old logitech optical mouse. My advice is to wait for the MkII as I'm sure Apple are already fixing these problems."
2,"Love the way it works, but be WARNED...","I'm on my third Mighty Mouse in 3 years. At $50 a pop, I expect them to last longer! Inevitably, after about a year or so, the trackball stops scrolling in one direction or another. I tried cleaning it with compressed air, but no luck. I always admire the MM's functions for 12 or so months, and then BAM! It chokes."
2,Good Until...,"Good Mouse until they break. 9 months and then the scroll ball died. Same thing happened to a friend. Poorly made, and Apple only gives a 90 day warranty. Not happy for $60."
3,Argh!,"This mouse works wonderfully, but the cord is too short! I can't even plug it into the front usb ports on my tower! It won't reach, not by a long shot. The only way it would reach is if I had my tower ON my desk, and not below it. What were they thinking? Not everyone has a usb passthrough keyboard or a mac mini, Apple! I'm going to be getting an iMac G5 in the next month so hopefully it will reach the usb ports on that but geez, seriously, they should've considered a longer cord then 2 freaking feet ESPECIALLY since there isn't a wireless option!I have a useless $50 mouse until I get my iMac. (And no, I didn't know better, the cord length isn't specified ANYWHERE on the box)Great functionality, but a major drag since I can't even plug it in due to the length of the cord."
1,World's Worst Mouse,"You've heard others call this the ""world's worst mouse"" and I came here to agree. Not only is this thing overpriced, it is also terribly designed. The Design. Be careful, after 2 months of using it, its pretty much injured my wrist. I've never had this problem with even the cheapest 2 dollar USB mouse out there. The Tracking. Absolutely horrible. There are times when you don't know why there's tracking delay, even though the battery is full. You make adjustments on the setting and it pretty much mess up the tracking even more. Its extremely frustrating because you can't fix this problem even by replacing the battery.. I now have two generations of Macs and the only reason why I have them on both occasions is because this thing comes with the box, and the same problems goes with both. I know people who basically threw away this mouse because of the same reason."
1,Worst mouse ever,I just bought my first iMac. I love the computer but hate the mouse (it came with it). It is always jumping all over the screen. It is hard for me to control it. The scroll function works okay and the design is nice and sleek. I am definitely going to get another mouse before it drives me nuts.
3,it's just ok,The scroll wheel is a nice addition but other added options are not too ergonomic for me.
1,Began to break down and short circuit after a few years,"I own this product and it worked great when I first bought it. After a few years, the side buttons went out, then the main button started to tweek out. It would click on everything and anything. . . when I was dealing with files and folders, they would all of a sudden disappear becuase my mouse was clicking on them, accidentally, when I was moving it across the screen. I had a lot of trouble with this because I hadno other mouse to plug in and return things to normal. i pretty saavy with electronics, so I opened it up - there's some very fragile circuit tape on the inside which broke fairly easily - not a user friendly schematic. I wouldn't recommend buying this product ."
4,When it comes Wireless??,Great but still wired... and still like the transparent (original design). About the functions its great...
4,Low key genius,This album goes brilliantly with a bottle of red wine.Fantastic simple guitar work and some wry lyrics.Highlights: The Well; In the Pines
5,Much to Love,"...Ah. I am a writer. I make my living describing places, people, things...and then I absorbed this album. And for perhaps the first time in my life, I am rendered speechless. There is nothing to add to this man's words. They are sublime. Perfect. Sad. Sticky and beautiful, like musical orange sherbet kisses on a hot day."
1,Smog? More like Smug.,"And I truly would understand this disposition if it were cemented in talent, but I mean come on. O.k. you're aesthetically ""aloof"", but aloof and engaging are too separate things, stupid.So you've thumbed your nose at society, you've thumbed your nose at ""accessibility"",but you've got neither the wit nor the talent to justify your ""inaccessiblity"". Maybe it's time you thumb your nose at yourself and call it a day. I'm sure Will Oldham would appreciate having a larger footing in the aging-hipster douc*e bag domain."
1,Overrated,"If his show is any indication of what's on this CD, I am not interested. His Vegas show is a glorified lounge act that's okay, not spectacular. While his imitations of Sammy Davis Jr., Nat King Cole, and Rod Stewart were very good, they were only 3 in a litany of more than 25 voices he attempted to do - most sounded the same, and nothing like the original. Why am I griping? $100 to see this would have been much better spent on 5 rides on the Stratosphere coaster. Sorry, no fan here."
5,Charlton Heston's best Film!,I really loved this film. Heston's spectacular perfomance and great plot make this one of the best films of all time! Of course this movie can't top THE BURB'S but it comes really close. I loved this film because there is a incredible chariot race sequence and a joke or two right when it needs one.This shows the REAL things that the romans did. I think that this is a classic for all ages! The little kids would like the horses the teens would like the action and everyone would like the plot. This even better than the first 2 LORD OF THE RINGS!
5,box set dvd,"this order was very well packaged, and was shipped even sooner than i thought, also the product was better than i expected"
5,Low cost Blu-ray alternative,"Great movie. My primary concern when I ordered was the movie would be cropped to 1.77:1. Based on information from other sources, I took a chance. Fortunately, the product details above are wrong. The back cover says the aspect ratio is 2.76:1, not 1.77:1. On my TV, it measures out around 2.65:1. It looks like this is discs 1 & 2 from the Ultimate Edition, so if you can forgo the books, nice case, and the special features on disc 3, this is a low cost alternative."
5,Excellent Blu ray Transfer for Epic Cinema Classic,"I have been waiting for Ben-Hur on Blu ray for a long time and there have been many various versions ranging from $35 version to ultimate collectors edition for $60. When I saw this for $14, I immediately ordered it (now it is just $10.99 when I wrote the review; I guess I should have waited for another week).Blu ray transfer is excellent. Picture and sound quality could not have been possibly better. They really did a great job with restoring this masterpiece. This movie is a must-have for all fans. It's hard to believe this movie was made in 1959. The final chariot race scene is amazing even in today's standard. Film making at its best.If you don't want to spend $35 or $60, I highly recommend this cheaper edition as you will still get the best out of Blu ray."
4,Really amazing for a gift.,I bought this for a gift for my mom because she adores the movie and she was so happy with all the extras in this wonderful package .I am totally satisfied.
5,Powerful,"This is an amazing flick. A spectacle but with a very intimate story. Friendship, love, faith, vengeance and so much more. Loved it!"
5,Perfect,Perfect.- The quality of the film- The contents of the package and everythingdeserves note 10.beautiful packaging
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The chariot race sequence is just as spectacular and amazing as you've heard, but the rest of the movie is sluggish and weighted with its own greatness; long and self-important, Ben-Hur is a movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon, not a Friday night."
5,The 1925 Silent Classic,"In 1924 theatre owner Marcus Lowe organized the merger of three studios. Louis B Mayer was named vice president of the new company and a 25 year old ""boy wonder"" Irving Thalberg was named head of production. The studio chose for its mascot a roaring lion and the phrase ""Ars Gratia Artis"": ""Art for Art's Sake"". The studio was called Metro Goldwyn Mayer. A year later the studio and Thalberg scored their first triumph with Ben Hur. The film set the standard for exelence on which MGM made its reputation.With fine acting from Ramon Navvaro, Technicolor sequences, and the great chariot race, this silent classic is still impressive today and is included in this set. As a bonus, you also get the crappy 1959 remake."
3,Great transfer but.........................................,"The transfer was very well done. The problem is that the movie has a bad script and only one memorable scene: the chariot race. Acting is not that great with Heston over the top as usual. Compare this to Spartacus which has a first class script with many memorable lines and great acting by Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov and Kirk Douglas. Spartacus is a thinking persons Ben Hur. Sorry to rain on this parade."
2,Sundayschool with gay tendencies?,"This movie is one Big mistake. It's at least twice as long as it should be (You just spend ten minutes listening two the opening music, before anything happens. I first thought it was some sort of mistake. When the story finally gets started you just wish you were back with the music.) The sentimentalism and the corny-ness of the plot defie all imagination. It reminds me of the Christmas tales my teachers used two read for a bunch of five-year olads and even then I was bored out of my skull. To enliven it the hero-villain relationship borders n the homsexual, but even that goes precisely nowhere.In the whole movie there are only two parts that bear watching: The sea-battle and the chariot-race. For the rest, forget about it. There are a lot of actors, who try, but there just is no way to make this movie interesting. If they scale it down to 100 minutes that would be an improvement. It shouldn't be too difficult. After all, the rest isn't worth watching anyway."
4,"Great picture, not perfect","There are several scenes that are not super clear - seems reasonable for a 50+ year old movie. But, the blu-ray kept me watching the movie like the first time I ever did. It helped me to share it with the family, too."
4,Ben-Hur DVD,"""Ben-Hur"" is just as good as I remember it from years ago. It's nice to have it in a format for viewing at home (including being able to pause it) because it's a long movie."
5,"Dated? No, timeless.","Is the movie completely realistic? No. But neither are movies made today. Remember that it's storytelling -- and in the case of Ben-Hur, grand storytelling.One more point: Although I enjoy the computer graphics of modern blockbuster movies, I must say that I'm far more impressed by the logistics, direction, stunt-work, and sheer scale of the chariot race scene than by anything I've seen in the Matrix or Terminator films."
5,Greatest Epic ever!!,This is undoubtable my favourite epic film of all time. Charlton Heston is fantastic in the film and I was saddened to heard that he had died just a few days ago.
4,Bad dubbing,"I like the movie but the DVD version's 5.1 sound sounds horrible! The dialogues are so badly dubbed that made me cringe. The voices become clearer and out of synch, added to the fact that the background effects disappear. Am I the only one who noticed this or is my stereo broken?"
5,Down my memory lane with Ben Hur.,"This 4 disk set is great. Having the ""original"" silent version was an unexpected bonus. As might be expected, my memory and the disk weren't quite the same. Highly entertaining."
3,Defective Disc 3????,"So far I've only watched the 1925 Silent version of Ben-Hur from the Four-Disc Collector's Edition. It is enjoyable and quite good with great special effects, considering it was made in 1925, but my copy had a very bad freezing up problem late in the movie during a scene where Ben-Hur is sleeping and unaware that his leper mother and sister are nearby. Did anyone else's disc have the same problem? Thank you."
1,is not the product order,"i am just the only film, without everything else. a swindle, the bluray it isn't the price paid. very disappointed"
1,Be Careful,"This is not so much a review of the movie itself, but of the quality of the DVD. After purchasing and receiving two Ben Hur DVDs via Amazon, and found both to be defective, I've given up. I'm purchasing this DVD from my local Best Buy store."
1,Ben Hur,"This film is one of the greats. It is very disappointing that the disk must be flipped over, which takes time and is distracting."
2,A Sundayschool story.,"This must be one of the most boring movies ever. Personally I could bearly keep my eyes open. Instead of the movie keeping the pace, I kept it myself, with a little help of the fastforward button. Charlton Heston is at his most narsistic. The story is so sentimental, that it is almost worse than the book. The only things worth watching are the chariotrace and Stephen Boyd as Messala. The rest might as well not exist."
1,BEN HUR,"Ben-HurMOVIE EVENTUALLY FAILED TO BOOT ON SIDE A AT ALL. PREVIOUSLY IT FROZE AT NAVAL BATTLE SCENE. SIDE TWO ALSO FROZE AFTER FIRST SCENE. I SENT IT BACK WITH AN EXPLANATION BUT LATER DISCOVERED THAT DUMMIE ME FORGOT TO PUT THE DISK IN THE PACKAGE. I HEARD NOTHING FROM PERSON I BOUGHT IT FROM, BUT MUST ADMIT I WASN'T SURPRISED SINCE I HAD FAILED TO INCLUDE THE DISK IN THE RETURN. AT THIS POINT I GAVE UP AND BOUGHT A NEW ONE AT BEST BUY FOR $19.99"
1,It sucks,"I ordered the Ben Hur DVD and it arrived with the middle piece broken that holds the DVD. So, the little broke off plastic pieces went to the buttom of the DVD and, of course, scratched it. For a classic movie like that for $30 it should be 4 DVD's and have some writing on the top. I waitet for the intermission part to be over after about 1 1/2 hours, and the movie never came back on.So, big, big lemon DVD - don't buy it!!!!Ben-Hur"
5,A Timeless Classic!,"I recently viewed this movie in blue-ray format, and still enjoyed it. This film won numerous academy awards in 1959, and it becomes apparent as to why after viewing it. I feel that this film is a must for video collectors. The blue-ray format is really effective in this movie, particularly with all the outdoor action scenes.JTB"
5,Charlton Heston: Epic Actor,"I was 7 years old when I saw Ben-Hur for the first time; the experience marked me forever. Many reasons: the spectacular presentation, Miklos Rozsa's memorable score and the main one: Charlton Heston's epic presence. Yesterday the inevitable came; Charlton Heston has died. This film will stand forever as testimony of the epic he embodied in cinema."
5,Ben-Hur DVD Review,"Are you kidding, what a great movie with very good DVD video quality. Must view for any movie buff! The chariot race scene is just amazing."
4,"Great Movie, Stupid Brothers","Ah, Ben Hur... that timeless epic, with amazing visual scene, compelling plot and awesome acting. The sound quality is great, you are able to hear the dialogue as well as the action at a reasonable volume, the picture quality is clean and stunning.THe stupidity lies in Warner Brothers inability to dual layer the DVDs or at least break the film into two discs, one for the film and the other for the Special Features... such as Fight Club, etc. This would eliminate the need to switch the disc over during the intermission.However, this is not such a problem, since their is an intermission in the movie. if this were a shorter film (like what WB did to Stargate) it would be appalling and horrible to destroy the movie's continuity by having to flip it.... but its ok and you should buy the DVD anyway. Great things lie within."
5,The greatest film ever made....,"Truly wonderful....on blu-ray the video is stunning, and the audio is fantastic....then there is the story.... Some have found this film to be boring--this is mind-boggling.... If you cannot find this film to be utterly magnificent, there is no hope for you....the story has the life of Judah Ben-Hur paralleling the life of Jesus, as in The Robe--only better....an epic mastepiece of film-making....almost four hours of great story-telling that you will never forget....it has to be experienced to be appreciated....well worth every cent...."
5,Ben Hur Ultimate Bluray,"This is an amazing transfer on bluray. For a movie buff this is almost perfection. Even though it is epic and grand in scope, some parts drag on for my taste. But a classic is just that, a classic and this is one of those. I appreciate all the effort put into this edition on bluray."
4,BEN HUR DESERVES BETTER,"I waited very patiently for what I expected to be the DVD of DVDs however I was disappointed with the presentation and packaging of this masterpiece. It seems Warner bros doen't take much pride in its DVD presentations. For one, the packaging stinks.... I had to buy a DVD case sold by Critics Choice Video in order to protect the packaging.The widescreen presentation was not the correct aspect ratio. When MGM released this title on laser disc they had the proper aspect ratio.The two side presentation was also uncalled for. MGM released the 195min ""Greatest Story Ever Told "" on one side and used a second disc for the extras. Wake up Warners.DVD buyers a more sophisticated than you might think."
3,"Great film, disappointing gift set","Length:: 8:11 MinsBen-Hur is a magnificent movie, everyone knows that.So, in this video I go directly into reviewing the gift set edition and it's contents.Hope you'll find it useful."
5,Hard to get better!,"I was probably about 8 years old when I first saw this movie. I was fascinated! Funny thing is, almost 20 years (and many viewings) later I am still fascinated. This is not just a childish tale--this is a magnificent story that captivates. OK, if you are used to the epics of today with the sex and gore you may not approve of Ben Hur, but this is wholesome. And if you don't mind just a little bit of thinking this movie is very exciting too. The chariot scene alone is almost worth watching the movie for! 100% recommended if you like epics!"
5,the epic of all epics,This is a flawless transfer of a brilliant movie.I can't think of many better ways to spend a Sunday afternoon.Marvellous.
5,Ben-Hur,"IMO. Arguably the best movie of all time. Aside form the obvious merits of the movie itself, this Ultimate Collector's Edition is a steal at this price. It comes in a very handsome box(serial numbered). It Includes 2 hardcover books and 3 cds(in it's own separate box). The Charlton Heston Journal makes for great reading as it provides a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie. The other larger hard cover book has absolutely gorgeous artwork and alone is worth the price of this kit. The Blu-Rays look spectacular and have great sound. It's hard to believe that the movie is from 1959. Kudos to Warner's for an outstanding restoration and remastering. If you're a movie buff, this is a must have."
5,Charleton Heston movie collections,The quality was great and this movie is my Fav. It also got here super quick in spite of the holidays. Where else can you get this service without hunting everywhere. I love many choice pieces with charleton Heston. This is one.rita-MN
2,DVD skipping 2 parts ... broken,The DVD is not working .. it was fine through about 30 minutes of the MOVIE. The physical apperence was as perfect as any I have seen. BUT somehow the DVD skips 2 parts of the frames. i am trying to find the way to return and get a new one.
3,The 1925 version is not in HD.,"Whatever they want with the very good quality of the bluray in the 1959 version and additional gifts but the 1925 version of Fred Niblo is not in High Definition. A Waste of edition. With all its drawbacks related to its restoration, Paramount released a very good bluray edition of The Ten Commandments; all in Full HD. Warner, learn from them!"
5,"You don't need to read the reviews, just get the movie...","God of my fathers! This is the most beautiful and stunning version of this movie. Don't waste your time reading all of this, trust me, just get the blu-ray and enjoy!"
5,DVD Movie,Great classic Bible movie and with Charlton Heston. This is great to watch for family night. This is a must for a movie collection not only for the Religion.
5,Ben Hur,Charlton Heston in one of his best movie rolls. Every time I see this movie I tell myself I must read the book. This is a beautiful story of one man's life to redemption.
5,STILL A GREAT FILM,I watched this in the theater when I was a heck of a lot younger. Too bad I was too young to appreciate it at the time. Perfomances are still phenomenal after all these years.
5,An Absolute Must for Any Collection,"An Epic film by an Epic Director starring an Epic lead and cast, scored by an Epic composer. These are the films that need to be watched by every person who dreams of triumph during times of oppression. These are films that every film student/teacher/buff (or not) must watch simply for the pleasure of watching and knowing. The stories are explosive, the action unmatched and the delivery of the cast ageless.I have no words to describe the grandiosity of this film in all of its aspects. I will say that no one should be dissapointed with these gems. They are absolute classics that will remain vibrant forever.Enjoy."
5,"I'm sorry But if you Do not like this film, You'll never be",A movie Buff... or would I consider any of your reviews.This is simply one of the best of cinema. You do NOT have to beleive in religion for this film to love it. This film is JUST a GREAT FILM. look at this film and you want to put it up against something like Titanic? BEN HURR HAS FAR FAR FAR FAR SUPERIOR ACTING! FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR! And Effort in making the film is always greater then CGI. and this film you can trully see the effort they put into it. I wouldn't give this a 1 Star for Any REASON...
5,Lindo Gift Set,Comprei esse gift set e fiquei impressionado com sua qualidade e beleza!Ben-Hur é um grande clássico e merecia uma edio to caprichada como essa!Todo colecionador tem que ter esse gift set.Fiquei muito feliz com essa compra!Joo BoscoBrazil
4,Ben-Hur ( 4 disc collector's edition),"Item was shipped promptly and arrived in excellent condition. I found the product to be like the seller described, ""new in plastic, never opened"". I have not watched the movie, yet, but I remember from years before watching it that it was a great movie."
5,Far Reaching,"I hadn't seen this movies for a number of years until recently when I came upon an old VCR copie. I had forgotten the deep message of the meaing of Love that was woven into the theme of the movie, and of the impact of the coming of the Christ into the world.It tells of the change that one small baby had on the entire life of a man and family, and eventually the world. Through struggle, even hatred, would emerge love and forgiveness. How so the picture of the Christian experience in the world and in a life. God's love victorious."
5,13 yr old girl,"I saw a part of this movie on TV and decided to buy it (that's strange, isn't it? A 13 yr old girl going back to old movies?). I've had it for 2 months now and have watched it about 10 times (my parents can't get me off the screen!). Everytime I watch this movie I cry. The end is so emotional! And the actors are very good. So, young people give it a try!"
5,Wow! Beautiful Movie with Great Sound,"What a gorgeous restoration of this beloved movie. I have seen the movie several times over the years (the first being on a drive-in theater screen at the old Circus Drive In outside Hammonton, NJ, after the movie was released). I have owned the MGM video cassettes and DVDs of the film. Simply stated, it has never looked and sounded as good as this blu-ray edition. Colors are accurately represented on my HD TV, however, it's the sound that amazed me. Charleton Heston is great in the title role. Blu-ray makes you hate Stephen Boyd even more (if that's possible). The chariot race is stunning. I wasn't sure if I would like the upgrade from DVD, but my fears were unwarranted. This boxed set should be the centerpiece of any blu-ray collection. Enjoy it for yourself, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,One of the Best Movies Ever,"The storyline was complex and interesting and combined love, hate, sacrifice, greed, despair and hope. It was one of the most inspiring movies I've ever seen and impacted me from the first viewing fifty years ago. The music is also beautiful and compliments the movie."
5,A Rare Treasure,"The restoration in blu ray was superbly done! The bonus DVD, and book included were also very interesting!It is a worthwhile addition to anybody's library."
4,A True American Classic,"Despite its unrelenting seriousness, William Wyler's high-budget depiction of a champion charioteer's encounter with Jesus is worthy of Hollywood's golden age. Some special effects show their age, but most scenes will leave you either breathless or teary-eyed--you may see Christ in a whole new light. Stephen Boyd is outstanding as Messala."
3,"a short, wide movie","Although this movie boasts a cast of 8,000, many of the characters in this film have such tiny roles that we never get to know them. For example, some cast members do nothing in the movie but sit in a stadium to watch chariot races. What do we as the viewer really know about these people?Ben-Hur is one of the longest movies ever made both in length of time and in widescreenedness. It is so much wider than it is tall that it makes you wonder what they were trying to hide.Jesus makes a cameo in this movie but to my great disappointment he doesn't take part in the chariot race."
2,Overrated,"I must start out that I have only been alive for some 20 years and have not have been privy to the evolution of movies. As an example, I wasn't all that impressed with Citizen Kane when compared to modern day movies. However, I can see how it was a pivotal piece of work that laid the foundation for other movies. This is exactly the same way that I feel about Ben-Hur. While the cinematography and acting are spectacular, the over drama becomes heavy handed when it doesn't advance the story. The whole romantic interest was thrown in to draw more people into the theaters. I feel that more time should have been focused on the actual plot. The movie ponders along and eventually comes back to the story in a lazy manner. If this movie were brought out today, then it would be seen as a valiant effort, but overproduced and bland. Overall, not bad, but not too good."
4,Pretty good...,"If you're just starting out learning Photoshop, this is probably the best way to learn. I understood everything easily, but I had fooled around with the program a little bit before. People who are less experienced with Photoshop may be confused or find it moving too fast.I found this worked best when I skimmed it all the way through, then tried to go through and read while I tried stuff in the program. Then, if I forgot how to do things, I looked them up in the book and it usually answered my questions. Still, it was a bit round-about at times and there were some things I were trying to do that it didn't explain."
4,Paul makes it a very merry Christmas!,"For those of you out there who like Christmas songs, this is definitely an album you should pick up. I especially like the duet with Terri Clark on ""Santa looked a lot like Daddy,"" very cute! This is a good album and the duets with other artists add a bit of uniqueness."
5,"Joe Henderson? ""say no more""","I am not long on wordsmithing about an artist history or comparisons to others, the music sells itself. This record is a great piece of work by Joe and his supporting cast. It fits in nicely with other great records of his, ""Multiples"" and ""Elements"". I would reccommend this piece to everyone who is a jazz or Joe Henderson fan."
4,Canyon Lady,"I've only listened to samples of this record, so far but by all accounts it sounds like a follow-up to the kind of music that Herbie Hancock was doing on 'The Prisoner'. I'd always thought that Hancock's movement from the 3rd-stream-like 'Prisoner' with it's large brass arrangements to Mwandishi was artificially fast - so it would seem, or so I would suspect either Joe had either influence over those sessions, or he took the torch and ran - because nothing that Hancock has done until the recent 'Gershwin's World has sounded as lush. So, if you loved the palying on Hancock's 'The Prisoner', then you will LOVE this record."
5,Fantastic Live Jazz,The David Morgan Trio is simply fantastic! It's very rare to hear a contemporary band play it as well as the classics but on Live at The Blue Note they really do. A must for any fan of live Jazz.
3,Erotically disturbing,"I had to find out what all the hype was about over this particular writer of erotic literature. And I must say, I found her writing to beautifully constructed. But I found many of the stories to be so twisted that it left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Venus Lacking Depth,"I was sorely disappointed after looking so forward to this book. The stories were lacking in depth and imagination. The only truly ""erotic"" stories were few and far in between; relying heavily on depictions of pedophilia and incest. A truer depiction of adult sex and lust and its motivations would have been much more enjoyable."
4,Penny OConnell,Exquisite erotica....somewhat bold and troubling and freeing to the soul.....truly enjoyed the stories and wonder about the impetus of thought in Ms. Nin.....would love to have known her personally.
3,worth the read but not great,"This was worth the read and if all the stories had been like Elena I would have liked it better. Some problems that I saw with this book are as follows: She killed the erotic mood frequently, and some of the stories seemed churned out. The book seemed like it was written for money and not for passion. It was bland and really had no depth; it was like watching a porno."
4,Reading Anais Nin is like reaping the field of wild oats,"Savory, intense, and pleasantly naughty by many conservative standards, Delta of Venus was given to me as a gift by a very unique and worldly friend. It engaged and entertained me immensely. I was reading this as I flew across the ocean, and felt a bit of a prickling on the back of my neck in the sort of ""what would the person next to you think if they saw what you were reading"" vein. Most enjoyable!"
5,Love this!,"At first, I was a bit jarred with how some of the stories didn't really have an ending but my god this is good! I spent the past couple of days reading the stories; I'm drawn into them. I have a couple more left to read, they're all the longer ones so I can't wait to dive in.Vulgar? No, in my opinion.Sensual. Yes.Her words just seem to flow, I really like that.I heard about Anais through a friend of mine and decided to give her a shot. Glad I did.People often seem to confuse erotica with porn; I've read too many ""erotica"" stories that are just plain porn...modern day erotica.Anais' work is what erotica should be, sensual, titillating high art...but then again, one person's erotica is another person's porn.Anyways, it's a quick, interesting read...a mixture of short stories that I think Anais Nin just wanted to try out to see where they would and wouldn't go."
3,interesting but not necessarily erotic,"there is a lot of interesting prose in this book but it's not the erotica I was expecting. she's got interesting things to say and discuss but if you're looking for something to turn you on, this might not be it."
1,It's like celery you have to develop a taste for the author,"Granted Anais Nin is a great author of erotic lit but the author writes to a specific kind of reader.I found the writing to be rather disjointed and if you love digging for truffles, or reading Jane Austen's 'Pride and Predjudice' type of books, you'll probably like this one ...For me, like celery, I can take it or leave it, in this case Ill leave it thank you."
3,if you are aroused by sex between a father &10-year-olds...,"I thought ""Delta of Venus"" was a decent book, but as far as being erotic, it hardly sparked my interest. I would only recommmend this book for one that likes their reading material intense, or is just plain sick."
1,I hope all erotic fiction is not like this,"So, I am not well versed in the world of erotic fiction. Because of the success of a certain Twi-hard bestseller that is several shades of garbage, I have decided to delve into the world of erotica. Well-written erotica that is. So, I have recently been reading the first chapter of some erotic novels to try and find a good one. (The Kindle allows users to read the first chapter of many books for free.) Delta of Venus was on an Amazon list of ""The Top 25 best erotic fiction"" so I gave it a go. Two little girls are molested by some Hungarian ""Baron"" in the first 25 pages. I mean, come on. Please, can someone suggest an erotic novel that is 1.) written by an author with command of the English language and 2.)not full of deviant sex (rape, child molestation, necrophilia etc.) Can't a novel be well written, sexy and graphic without including whips, chains, inscest and violence? I haven't found one yet. Delta of Venus is certainly not one."
2,Delta of Venus,"Ok I got it. I got it after the first 3 stories. Unless you are studying the difference between male and female fantasy, I found the book boring."
2,Flat Erotica,"As a blogger who writes quirky and unconventional perspectives on LOVE, I am compelled to read what is moving the public. Anais Nin's Delta of Venus was definitely an improvement over Fifty Shades of Grey. However for me, erotica is not personally moving sans the romance. Nin herself writes that sex without love lacks color. Delta of Venus is a series of short sex stories. I stayed with it anticipating that one of the essays would capture my attention. Instead I was once again disappointed in reading about atypical sexual perversions void of emotion. More interesting is to consider how scandalous Delta of Venus was in the context of the tImes. Howard Roarke in the Fountainhead got me going more than the characters in 50 Shades of Grey and Delta of Venus. Back to writing on ILoveYouOften.com, an optimistic reality check on love and relationships and other good stuff!"
5,WELL WRITTEN - THE BEST OF EROTICA,"Other reviewers have used ""poetic"" several times, so that sort of leaves that one out for me. This is though, some of the best writing, erotic and non-erotic, you will find. The writer approaches the subject with great passion, and there is no way you cannot appreciate her use of words. I enjoyed and think quite highly of the author's Little Birds, but I do feel she probably does even a better job with this one. If you buy one of the works, you might as well go for both of them as each belongs in your collection. Recommend this one highly."
4,Classic and still relevant,"I was a little worried when the first story featured a pedophile, but the rest of the stories were hot. I guess what turned people on back then can still turn them on now. I liked the lives of the French painters and the women who loved them."
2,Delta of Venus,This is the second of her books I have read. I will not purchase anymore. I found it rather boring as I did her first book. Unfortunately I purchased both books at the same time. I would not recommend. There are so many more ... books out there that are better.
2,I expected something deeper,"I guess I was expecting better writing from Nin. I have heard so many good things about her writing and I have read a few books by one of her ""good friends"", Henry Miller, that I decided to pick up Delta of Venus and was a bit disappointed. In the introduction Anais Nin describes the conditions under which she wrote much of what is contained in this book. Some wealthy ""collector"" had commissioned erotica at the rate of $1/page and he was not interested in anything but the physical act of sex. Well, Nin delivered. Much of the content is the description of various sexual situations and lacks what I would consider art. Reading Delta of Venus I felt like I was reading a more tasteful version of Letters to Penthouse. I must admit, this is my first exposure to Nin so I am not saying she is not a gifted author. I understand she was commissioned to write stories of this nature, I'm just saying I expected something more."
2,Can't understand why this book is so boring,"Hmm - why is this book such a bore? Surely the appeal of erotica is in reading about things that cannot normally be discussed; ideas that would not normally be thinkable, behaviour that would not normally be permissable. So what does it say when none of the sad packs appearing in these short stories manage to bring forth any concepts which are novel, surprising or confronting? Incest, necrophilia, exhibitionism all get a look in, but in a way which is unappealing - the book seems to assume an audience with the traditional Western attributes of repressed sexuality, a belief that sex in sinful, and hatred of the human body. To answer my own question, the implicit assumptions that pleasure is evil, sexuality is sinful and that people are ugly, is what makes it a bore."
1,I HATE THIS BOOK!,"I tore this book to shreds after I read it. Though the book is charming at times and intelligent once or twice, it is built on the premise that only the unfamiliar is erotic. Nin has written the same basic story over and over here: woman encounters stranger, has sex with stranger, experiences epiphany. I wanted nothing more than to stop reading, or to discover something truly erotic within the stories -- trust me. It isn't there. DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE!"
3,worth the read,As far as erotica goes it's good if you keep in mind when it was written but its not as good as some of todays writers.
3,Keep this book away from kids,"I read this book when I was 10, and it absolutely horrified and disgusted me. I had nightmares for years about being sexually molested and was often afraid of boys and men. Now in my early twenties, I realize that the detached style of narration does not mean that the author condones these acts or implies that they are normal and healthy (I refer especially to the rape and pedophilia), and that is a unique, even ground-breaking book due to Nin's style and breadth of imagination.However, I still think no review of this book is complete without this caveat: Some of what is protrayed is not erotic--it is violent and abusive.Please, keep this book out of the reach of kids and yes, I would say even teenagers who may not be mature enough to comprehend that difference. Leave something lying around that portrays healthy, loving relationships."
3,Delta of Venus,I have read many books more exciting than this one. I thought it was very bland. She is a good writer but perhaps the subject matter was a little outdated. I will not read her works again.
5,Lots of useful information,"This is one of the best advanced primers on electrical work that I've seen. It requires a thoughtful read to absorb its details and mindset that stresses the myriad dangers arising from old, sloppy installations. The book's thoroughness teaches the novice to recognize limits. It is worth many times its price for making the homeowner intelligible on electrical concepts and terms, a useful skill to have when consulting with professionals. I've been reading it on and off for years, and always gain new insights. Definitely worth five stars, especially for knowledge that could save a life."
1,your old wiring,Sorry to say this book was not of any use to me. Ive been an electrician for 20 plus years. Mostly industrial work. I wish I could get my money back. I used to teach electricians in the Air Force. From that back ground I dont think that anyone could get very much use from this book. I was hoping to learn somethings about residentual wiring because I dont do that kind wiring for a living. I never even finished reading the book. It was full of alot of useless fluff. I hope to sell this book at a flea market this summer to atleast get back some of my money.If I knew then what I know now I wouldnt buy it or suggest anyone reading it. I am sorry to write this I had high hopes for this book.
2,Only for the patient reader,"Wordy, wordy, wordy. Lots of info there, somewhere -- like Ronald Reagan's story of horse poop in Xmas stocking: look for the pony, if you like. I couldn't, and I seldom put down a promising book.Negative stars to publisher McGraw-Hill, for failing to promote simple, declarative sentences, and to emphasize points through book design/layout."
4,I love disco vol. 2,"Mmmmhh... let's see. this cd's have 22 songs... 18 good songs/remixes. It's a recommendable CD. but the song of future world orchestra... the cd cover said ""dance music"", this is a romantic song... bad point, the song ""precious little diammond""... was a hit in the 80's? where? it's no good."
3,Alan Jackson Vol 2 Disc 2,Don't get me wrong I like Alan Jackson. Along with George Strait they are the finest singers of country today holding true to the traditional country music style. So much of it today is rock and roll masquerading as country.In Alans Vol 2 disc 1 they give you 18 selections. All good. In Disc 2 you only get 6 selections. Come on now Alan has more than enough hits out that they could have put more than 6 on the disc. Actually they all could have gone on disc 1. A lot of albums have 24 selections on them and more.I like whats there but I get the feeling that greed has gotten to the producers of this album and I keep feeling I was ripped off.
1,Alan jackson cd,I received my cd of alan jackson and it doesn't work. Tried to play in several cd players didn't work in any of them.
1,AWFUL,I NEVER RECIEVED MY ITEM. NO CONTACT WATSOEVER FROM SELLER THAT ITEM WAS UNAVAILABLE OR ANYTHING. I CONTACTED THEM ONCE BY E-MAIL AND RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. WILL NEVER USE THIS SELLER AGAIN. BEWARE
1,Alan Jackson's Greatest Hits Volume II,You sent me a blank disc. Nothing on it. That's the end of ordering from Amazon. It's rated one star just to get this stupid review filed with Amazon.
4,RELAXED INSPIRED COUNTRY,"JONATHAN RICHMAN, the modern lover, as we know him.Here he is approaching country music, Grand Old Opry Style.He is doing it very smart, intelligent and in relaxed mood.A very nice statement on a record made with great love to authentic music."
3,Not Bad,"Melendez went for a more hip-hop/urban-contemporary sound on her sophomore effort. Though she found a little bit of success with the lead single, ""Goody Goody"" - a hip-hop laced R&B; groove featuring a rap by Greg Nice, that was about it. Perhaps she wasn't quite ready for the transition from club diva to street chanteuse. There are a couple of nice entries to be found in the mellow, midtempo swayer ""Will You Ever Save Me"" and the catchy ""Love Type Situation."" And she didn't totally abandon her freestyle followers, as evidenced by numbers such as ""My Warning"" and ""On Again Off Again."" But somehow those tunes are not as impressionable as classics like ""Together Forever"" or ""Never Say Never"" from the first Melendez album (see my review).This is a decent album, but not an essential unless you're a diehard freestyle completist."
4,NOT AT ALL THE COLOR OF THE PICTURE!,"Even though the price is right, the color is not what i expected. The color is more of a burgandy not Red. However, its a very nice color and has the motorola sign on it. Comes nicely packaged in a reclosable container that can store the stock case. Amazon packes it in with air filled pouches. ALL IN ALL I GIVE IT A 5 star. However, becasue of the wrong color, it goes down to a 4 star."
1,"Shanti , unfortunately a poor effort","Shanti which means peace is a beautiful word, unfortunately Ms Khalsa's CD does not induce that feeling. For people out there who like sikh hymns I would recommed any other recording by one of the 'bhaijis' these are the singers who perform at a sikh temple and they will realize the difference. The Cd cover is good but unfortunately that is where I would stop."
1,wont buy without listening sample!,"the description is interesting, but nowhere to find a listening sample. wont buy a cat in a box! more customer service please!"
5,"Blissful, touches my soul!","Wonderful album. Snatam's voice is amazing and touches me deep within my soul. She's obviously singing straight from the heart and anybody of any (or no) faith can experience the divinity in these tracks, even more so after reading the English translations. I have no idea what 'A music fan from NYC' is talking about. Those 'bhajis' are boring and put me to sleep! Big up my sister Snatam for taking our music to the next level and producing something which the masses and Sikh youth can appreciate."
2,Look elsewhere...,"This book is geared towards hunting folks and not the general Golden owning public. I do not recommend it for a general book on the breed. The pictures are nice, though."
5,probly the best pistol ive seen,this gun can pack some firepower. my friend was using this and i had the super 9 pro sniper rifle. i had to dodge the bbs from this thing from 120 feet away. i was amazed. he had .20 grams in it but still it was shooting eccelent. he didnt even angle the gu up at all and it almost hit me from 120 feet away.
5,The best single ever creatwd by No Limit,This is the best single ive ever recieved in 4 years of collecting rap CD's. The lyrics are great and has a good beat. Master P ur da bomb.
3,Pretty tight NL song,"This song is tight but if Master P wanted to release a single from ""Only God Can Judge Me,"" then he should have released ""Y'all Don't Want None"" because that's the tightest song on the album!"
5,All the luxury you'd expect from a quality duo!,I'm speechless. This is probably the best jazz album I've ever heard. A superb blend of styles within a five-song ep strongly supported by two of the best legendary performers in jazz history. Enough said. It's a must have in any serious jazz collection.
4,Good item!,"I have a family with five children in a two story house (bedrooms upstairs).I have nine of these wired together in my house.I put the system in about 10 years ago.I put a lighted ""on/off"" switch in the kitchen beside the hallway to the second story bedrooms. When the system has tripped due to cooking or some other smoke incident in the house we can shut the alarms off till the air clears. This has worked really well over the years.My biggest concern for the family safety is at night when we are all tucked in bed and asleep.With the battery powered units (BRK-9120B) you cannot turn the system off with a switch so if all are wired together and an incident happens you have to put up with the alarms (all) till they go off. UGH!!The only drawback I have with these is that they wear out but then I knew that when I put them in."
4,Good replacement to the older units,Replacement would be easier if it fit on the existing base plate. Otherwise it is easy to replace.Good price.
4,Easily installed alarm,"Easy to install - I bought two of these to replace ""expired"" smoke alarms, and give us a little more reassurance that we had protection.The test procedure/button/sound cannot be much easier to performThe blinking red light (and hidden light in the device) help reassure us something is workingThe alarm sound is quite loud enough"
4,"So far, so good","We purchsed these to replace the battery backup versions that were getting old and having constant chirping, even with new batteries. I read on Amazon that someone else had replaced with these, and so far, so good. No more chirping...We did buy 2 battery operated smoke detectors (one upstairs, and one downstairs) as we did not want to be without protection if the power was out. They installed easily, as the use the same plug. (You do need to replace the base, but it is extremely easy and each detector was less than 5 minutes to replace."
4,Good,I bought these based on brand and price. I am happy to have no batteries to change. Easy to install.
2,Not the model pictured,"The product pictured has a battery door which is the 9120B, not the 9120 as labeled (and shipped to me). This model is hard wired like the 9120B, but is missing the battery backup. Without a battery backup the smoke detector will not work in case of a power loss.I'm not quite sure why thy make a model like this, but for me it is useless and now I have to ship back the product because Amazon did not appropriately represent the product."
3,Smoke Alarm,"I can not really rate this product because I needed to install it in a home that we sold and to get a CO, we needed to have all smoke detectors working and I purchased this one to replace an old one that was no longer serviceable."
2,It BEEPS all the time!,"After reading all of the positive reviews, I bought 6 of these smoke alarms for my home. Installation was very quick and easy. My husband installed all 6 (according to the instructions) within an hour. It has been two weeks now, and EVERY DAY at random times during the day (3am, 4pm, 9am) for no reason at all, each smoke alarm BEEPS. The sound is piercing and has woken us up in the middle of the night on several occasions. We've read the instructions and even contacted the company about the erratic beeping and were told that it ""may happen from time to time."" Unfortunately, we threw out the boxes, so we cannot return the alarms to amazon. If anyone has sleeping children, I suggest you buy a different alarm."
1,no back up,i was very disappointed to realize there was no battery back up! what happens when the power is out before the fire starts or during the fire!
1,Pitiful.,"This movie is awful. The sex scenes need a ton of help, as the women are awful ""lovers"". In one scene, the girl who is receiving just lays on the bed and doesn't move. You would see more movement from a blow up doll. It's also pathetic how they tried to make some of these girls butch. It just doesn't work. And, the most attractive girl in the entire movie is Shelby. If you want some real action, check out [...] Don't waste your money on this movie. It's awful!"
5,Great juice,"Great tasting juice, there is nothing else in the bottle exept fresh squeezed grape juice, not even water, so pure."
3,"Ron's Take on ""Double Take""","I am an Avid Petra Fan and I usually love anything and everything that they put out. On the Whole I really do like this CD. I really Love the New Arrangements of ""Beyond Belief"" and ""This Means War"". ""The Longing"" which is a new cut from the band I feel will likey be a radio hit for the Band. Their are some low spots on the CD as well. ""He Came He Saw"" Just doesnt work with the new Arragement. ""Creed"" and the ""Coloring Song"" seem to be Lathargic in nature and seem to drag on and on. On the Whole I feel it should definitely go into your Petra Library. Hearing these Songs Played Live I believe will definitely give the CD a boost as Well! Thumbs Up!"
2,Disappointing attempt to stay current,"Petra, through the 70s and 80s, were always able to stay musically current and relevant, riding the wave of that era's musical trends. They stumbled badly when the decade of the 90s rolled around. In my mind, their last classic album was Beyond Belief, and though every album since has had its high points, none has been consistently great. Now comes Double Take, an album that tries to change their big arena rock sound into an acoustic, 90's vibe. For the most part, it doesn't work, and, at times, is even painful to listen to. Unfortunately, it sounds like Petra is determined to reinvent itself for each subsequent generation. After two decades of success, their chameleon act has run out of magic."
1,"Boy, Petra's lost it",After hearing this CD I've decided I'm probably not going to be in a hurry to buy any more music from them. They've really gotten bad. And what's with all this weird western sounding junk in the background? Their older stuff was good. I'm an 80's Petra fan.
1,This is it. I've had it.,"If you like the trendy Jars of Clay music, which is dragging every other artist in Christian music into a deep pit of boring ballads for the next 20 or 30 years, buy this album. If you are concerned about the fact that Petra's ministry has lost many fans over the past 2 years, email me at socko130@hotmail.comNow that i've let that out, I'm gonna pop in some of the old stuff. If you are mad at me, sorry. I just noticed that Petra is really weak right now. They haven't been on WOW for a few years either."
4,Petra Remixs,"This album is very good. Even though some of the remixs are a little less than what I was hoping for in this remix album the way they are done is excellent. Alot of the songs remixed are mellowed out, which more often than not gives then a much more musical sound. Praying Man is my favorite song on this album, and it rocks!! Judas Kiss, Beyond Belief, and Beat the System are really cool, toned down versions of excellent songs that sound awesome in the new mixes. This Means War is the only downside to the CD that I found. It was slowed way down, too much in my opinion, but the message is still loud and clear. Petra still rocks for the Rock."
1,the downward spiral continues,"Since No Doubt (our music wimped out), Praise 2, God Fixation, and now Double Take, this band gets worse and worse every new release and sounds more like teeny-bop rock (i.e. Christianized Hanson) than the creative powerhouse they were in the eighties. I agree with one reviewer ""Petra is out of Gas"". It's time to hang it up and let Burlap to Cashmere and Jennifer Knapp usher in the new CCM revolution."
3,"A so-so album, but not the atrocity some say","Taken on its own, I think this is a decent album with a couple excellent songs (Breathe In, for one).However, most longtime Petra fans are probably going to compare the songs on here with the original versions and decide they don't like these new takes. Oh well.The idea of this album was to re-introduce Petra classics to a generation unfamiliar with them. But lack of airplay caused that goal to fail.Petra followed this album with superior work on ""Revival"" (2001) and their final studio album ""Jekyll & Hyde"" (2003).Fans of Petra's rock songs would do well to buy J&H.; Fans of Petra's praise songs should check out Revival.Fans who are open-minded should check out ""Double Take."" The music is solid and surprising."
3,A Single Take is Good Enough,"While I applaud the band's efforts in reconditioning many of the older songs, I do not think this was the best way to do it. I will say that ""The Longing"" is a nice new song that sounds pretty good, but it is not the rock-n-roll we want to hear from Petra. However, if Petra is looking at stretching its creative genius, then far-be-it-for-me to impede their progress. I hope this helps them grow closer together and prepare for the next album. Just do us one favor, bring back the aggressive distorted guitars, thumping rhythm section, and soaring keyboards we grew up on over the past three decades. John Schlitt, you can still sing better than anybody else in hard rock."
2,Why?,"It's one thing to go back and remake a song to improve it. But why take out a bunch of really awesome songs and try to see how far you can mutate them just for the fun of it, while destroying several good songs in the process (thank goodness I have the good versions on other albums). This album makes me wonder if the band has come to the end of their creative road and are simply fishing the bottom of the barrel to try to come up with something they can release just to get the label off their backs or to make a buck. I have loved Petra for two decades, but this, as far as I'm concerned, is not Petra."
1,WHAT IS THIS?,"I signed up for a music club and unfortunately did not get to review this album before I purchased it. I just assumed it was a type of greatest hits album. It is FAR from ""greatest"" and I am so disappointed, we don't even listen to it. I wanted an album with the ""old"" mixes as a ""take me back"". This just ticked me off. Sorry, PETRA, this CD should crawl back under the rock."
3,"Petra, what is happening?","I can call myself a Petra music fan from Sweden. (I don't beleve in what they stand for) I am not really in to religion, but enjoy good music when I hear it. Petra music is good in general, and Bob writes ballads as no other band, just great. We hold our heart out to you, First love etc. GREAT. However this album is if you ask me not as good as each original song.I don't like this ""try"" to convert young people through playing ""todays"" type music consept as they seem to use. Everyone should form their own opinion in religion. I also actuallt would like to know how christion they actually are, as it seems like album sales is very to much important for these guys and GOD functions more like a niche to be able to sell more and have ""loyal"" CD buyers."
1,Don't give it a chance.....it's boring!,"The only song that was half good was Judas' Kiss, and it ain't even the same melody. None of the songs are anywhere near the caliber of the originals."
1,The band is falling apart.,Goodbye Petra. I enjoyed all of your music before GOD FIXATION. You were my favorite band. Now you're not even a band.
1,"Ouch, who's idea was this?","I've always loved Petra, I've gone through many changes with them, and continued to love them. This new album is a step in the wrong direction in my opinion. I want so bad to find something to like in it,but there's nothing there. ""Dance"" was the only song that I found even somewhat acceptable, but it still pales in comparison to the hard-rocking original. This one goes to the very bottom of my Petra collection, maybe if I ignore it, it will go away. Go with ""God Fixation,"" if you want an example of the Petra that I still love."
1,"""Petra Lover's Wife""","My husband of nearly 11 years has loved Petra since before I knew him - collecting albums, going to concerts, playing his cassettes until they were worn out, etc. This album he THREW IN THE TRASH!!! The songs chosen for this album are Petra classics, yet they ruined them in our opinion. The remade versions change the style of the music so you can hardly tell it is Petra. If you love the original songs, you will likely not like these versions. My suggestion: listen to the excerpts and see for yourself."
4,"Not bad, not great, not normal Petra.","Ok, I've listened to a lot of the old petra albums and really enjoyed them. So when I saw Double Take I decided to buy it. I was very surprised to find that petra removed the electric guitar from this album and substituted a classical guitar. While the songs are still good, this album doesn't sound like the old Petra. Consequently, most people who loved the old Petra sound won't appreciate this album."
1,What the ........... ?,"ok, so I'm not 13, sue me.I can't believe what they've done to these songs! Beyond Belief sounds horrible, and Dance is far too contemporary!Ugh, I'm glad I didn't buy this cd."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad","I have been a Petra fan for over 10 years now...and, with the exception of the War & Rememberance recording, I have all of the Petra albums. I don't really know WHAT the band was thinking, and I know John and Louie are getting old, but COME ON! At least put an Ubpeat sounding song on the thing! Judas Kiss was done pretty well in my opinion, as was Beyond Belief, Just Reach Out, and Dance. This Means War was done terribly! I can not believe that they mutilated This Means War in the fashion that they did. It sounds AWFUL! Everything else is ok, and the Coloring Song is reworked wonderfully. The two new songs on this album are really cool, too. However, the album does give off the impression that Petra is trying to emulate Jars of Clay or Caedmon's Call. Oh, yeah, if you liked John Schlitt's higher pitched vocals, do not get this album. He stays low the entire time."
2,Who is this by?,"The trouble with recent Petra albums is trying to decide who they are by. Is it John Schlitt or is it Peta, and if the latter then who is in the band this week. Mr Schlitt seems to have taken on the mantle of destroying whatever was left of the intergrity of this once great band. This album is dire. No more, no less. With insipid and lifeless versions of previous Peta classics, it is an example of down far downhill they have gone wince the glory days of Unseen Power et al.With the recent 'firing' of their long serving drummer for no aparant reason, I'm afraid that the writing is on the wall. A sad epitaph. This album says it all really."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS CD?,"Just like GOD FIXATION, this album came and passed. It was on Bilboard Christian Charts for like one week, and now its gone, and so is Petra. Bye, Petra. I guess we should all listen to their old stuff, because that's all that is left of them. THIS ALBUM SERIOUSLY SUCKS!"
5,This REALLY works!,"Can a week change your life?I bought a copy of this book in early 2006 but it just languished on my bookshelf. Thumbed through it but never gave it much thought.On New Year's Day 2007, I made a resolution to find love.And I finally took this book seriously.I read a chapter each day and did the exercises inside.Cover to cover, it took a week.By August, I had found my life partner with all the ideal traits I had on my list.We've since been together for 5 years, and I couldn't be happier!!!If you are serious about finding a life partner, BUY THIS BOOK!It will change your life!"
4,My Favorite Violinist...,"I fell in love with Bisharat's music upon listening to the albumAmerican Riverby Jonathan Elias, one of my favorite albums of all time, in no small part due to Charlie's playing.I had to find something else by this brilliant player, and eventually stumbled across this album, apparently his one and only solo album, released in 1993. He doesn't disappoint; this is a new age bombshell, filled with the dazzling violin stylings of Charlie Bisharat."
3,LEXX APPEAL,"The video transfer is excellent on this DVD, however the sound leaves a lot to be desired. I have a good audio system hooked into my television and the audio tracks were still bad. I was disappointed in sound quality. When you purchase a DVD you expect a higher quality level all around."
1,Laurel and Hardy Rare Home movies (1923-England),Very poornot enough of the good old boyssorry I bought it!
4,Royal Scandal,"I got this DVD for the ""special feature"" - the entire 60 minute version of ""A Royal Scandal"" about the very rocky marriage of George IV, son of George the 3rd and dissolute Prince Regent, starring Richard E. Grant and Susan Lynch. This is excellent and worthy of 5 stars on its own. Very well acted and well written. The Queen's Sister is good, but not great. Very good acting, but the script was a bit over-the-top."
3,"Choice was yours, ma'am","A tragic comedy of a talented vibrant female's life wasted with personal both thirst for publicity and illusions of superiority inherited.A little if at all, compassion this always second-to-fifth-in-line triggered in a commoner watching a princess's story."
1,A good story badly told,Nothing is more sad than to see a good story ruined. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Incoherent and naive.
3,no crouching tiger!,"I recently saw the incredible crouching tiger, hidden dragon. this movie left me wanting to see more movies like it. i did some research and found, the bride with white hair. unfortunately this movie did not live up to the quality of cthd. this movie suffered from the murkiness of the video transfer. almost all the scenes are obviously shot at a sound stage...the lighting was awful and the fight scenes were blurry. there were some pretty cool ""wire"" fighting scene, to simulate incredible jumps and flight....unfortunately, again, these scenes are often blurry and hard to see. the movie is not bad...just not great."
1,"Widely acknowledged classic, I hated it","The movie is widely considered a classic for Hong Kong action movies. Leslie Cheung is a fantastic actor, and I enjoyed Bridgitte Lin very much in Chungking Express. So, even though I don't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies, I still decided to watch this movie. I was extremely disappointed. The cinematography is boring and poorly done. The plot is juvenile. It is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys. I hated the movie. However, I fully understand that many, many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important HK movies ever made."
4,Nice Cinematography,"I bought this film because of an ad I saw on another Kung fu flick. I have to say that I was impressed right away with the cinematography. Even though the film has a dark overtone, the film was interseting to watch.I also found the chacraters to be interesting and the plot absorbing.THe only reason I gave the film four stars, was due to the lack of satisfying fight scenes. It's definately not as action packed as a Jet Li flick. But I'd say the stroy is alot more intellingent.If you want a Kung fu flick with a little less intensity then Jet Li, this should be right for you. If your looking for more, then I suggest you rent it at least once to see if it's to your liking."
4,Quite nice,"This movie is quite nice. Another one of Brigitte Lin's best sowrdfighting movie. The fighting moves and love story between Brigitte Lin and Leslie Cheung are very good. Overall, worth seeing it."
5,Very Very Cool,"This movie is brilliant. It has both amazing imagery and a classic storyline. It's hard not to like this movie because of those two factors. After seeing this flick, you just fall in love with."
5,The Most Action Packed Romance Ever,"I first was introduced to this movie as a curiosity. Being a great fan of Xena: Warrior Princess, I learned that one of many influances on the shows creators were Ronny Yu's ""The Bride with White Hair"" and after viewing this spectacular film 5 times in a row, I love it!!! I'll be it is somewhat hard to follow at times, because there is some much to see, the cinematography is amazing and the scenery is beautiful, even during a war, But, if you give it a chance, this film is worth watching. If your a fan of high paced gory action, Xena, romantic love against all odds or fanasty adventures, this movie is for you. Just make sure you have a lot of popcorn handy because you won't want to move from your seat until the film is over...."
5,Hong Kong film classic,I've watched this film over and over again since it's DVD release. I've never tired of watching it. It is a beautifully sad and romantic tale. Brigitte Lin is so lovely even her famous icy stare of death. Leslie Cheung (rest in peace) what a wonderful actor! We will miss him dearly.Brigitte and Leslie had tremendous on-screen chemistry and the cinematography is breathtaking. This is not a karate chop and sock film. There are some short fight scenes. I feel sorry for people that did not understand this movie. It is a true ART film and displays Hong Kong filmmaking at it's best.
3,as described,"was a good film, however not quite what i expected.i would rate as 3.5 but that's not possible."
4,"Great Art direction, beautiful story.","Like many of the greatest love stories, this love story is tragic. But hang on, DO SEE THE SEQUEL! Personally, I love the sequel better than the first one. Although I admit the first one is the much better film than the latter. The art direction was great, and you got the most romantic leading man in Hong Kong to play the lead. I highly recommand to see the sequal, despite the bad storyline, the VERY LAST 10 MINUTES ARE MUST SEE! Because the story didn't end in the first episode. For those who feel emtremely sorry for them, DO SEE THE LAST 10 MINUTES OF THE SEQUEL. Everything will make perfect sense there, I sware. And I think that is the perfect ending of this whole love affair. There isn't any other way to end."
4,Excellent movie,"This is an excellent movie! As a viewer who is familiar with the book story, I have to say that this movie did a pretty good job of sticking to the original story line. the fight scenes were of high quality and beautifully filmed. The romance of the story was reasonable with good acting by both actors. Definitely a movie to see!"
2,Lower your expectations,"The story is good and the screenplay has the right idea, but the low-grade technical aspects are terrible. The considerations one must make for this is too much. The movie on this DVD is primitive stuff! (too bad for South City) If Ronny Yu did it today with access to all the technical devices and support it would be worth the money."
4,Reminded Me Why I Don't Usually Get Dubbed Versions,"'The Bride With White Hair' blows most other 'sword-play period movies' out of the water. It's a non-stop visual feast, the fight scenes are amazing, and the characters are emotionally involved with each other and their surroundings. And, near as I can tell, the acting *was* top-notch... but that's a bit hard to tell as I think some of it has been leeched away by weak performances on the part of some of the voice actors. (Particularly annoying were the scenes where the doomed lovers first meet...)'The Bride With White Hair' thankfully trancends the weak dubbing effort. It only hampered my enjoyment to the point where I took a single star off.I highly recommend this film... but do yourself a favour and get the subtitled version. And whatever you do, make sure it's 'letterboxed.' You don't want to miss any of the exciting visual presentation of this masterpiece!"
4,"Great movie, lousy transfer","First, the movie: I saw this film in the mid 90s at a film festival in Houston. I had no information or expectations before-hand. I just sat in a dark room and it showed up in front of me. It immediately went on my top 10 list and I dragged all of my friends to see it a few days later. It's way over the top in every dimension. Visually stunning and unapologetically emotional. Brigitte Lin kicks ass so hard you can actually believe that a goth-fu loner like Leslie Cheung would turn the world upside down just for her.Second, the DVD: Blech. A soft, non-anamorphic transfer of an ugly print. Gargantuan subtitles fill a big chunk of the image. Not a significant improvement over the Tai Seng US release laserdisc.5 star movie, 2 star DVD."
5,very good- has attitude,"Non-traditional bellydance music. My students love the songs because they have attitude. Some hip hop, rap and reggae beats incorporated. Good bass beats to get your booty shaking."
4,nice,"Five short and sweet tunes. Not the greatest recording ever, but more than likely worth whatever you might pay for it."
4,Informative and Erotic!,"""Daddy And The Muscle Academy"" is a wonderful DVD about Tom of Finland, a gay artist who has inspired an entire cultural wave for both gay and straight men all over the world.Features an entire gallery of Mr. Finland's work, and lots of information about the artist himself; including personal history and sketching techniques, as well as small interviews with men who admire Mr.Finland and his work.Highly Erotic!"
3,same for me,"I wanted to see other reviews just to see if I was crazy or not about how much the battery last on this toy. Turns out that I was right. If you take the toy outside your house you will not get more than 5 to 10 minutes of play. I would not ever buy this toy again and the store I bought it from will not allow me to return it, I can only replace it for the same one."
3,Surprise!! Not bad!,"After the atrocious Marley Magic DVD, I didn't have high hopes for this one either but was pleasantly surprised. Granted, there were some missteps such as Hootie (Darius Rucker) singing ""War"", Chrissie Hynde singing ""Waiting in Vain"" (absolutely god-awful) and Busta Rhymes on ""Rastaman Vibration"" but overall the show captured the spirit of Bob's music. I especially enjoyed Lauren Hill and Erykah Badu. Ziggy and the Melody Makers were also good as was Tracy Chapman. Overall, a keeper."
5,Best Concert DVD SO Far,"DVD Concerts have been very slow in coming. Being a huge music fan, I try to get the artists that interest me but so far there have only been a few that really rock. The Marley Concert is an exception. It sounds and looks great. Although, Bob isn't on the disc he is very well represented by a large group of some of the best performers, topped off by Ziggy and family. Anyone who loves music and especially Reggae should check this out."
3,Modernized Marley,"While the CD release of the matching title was suprisingly good, the live concert/tribute turned out to be average. The musical quality is excellent, although the show is sometimes slow. There are numerous familier performers which participate in this tribute by covering Marley songs. The bottom line is for this title to be worth the purchase, familiarity with current artists and their styles of music as well as an appriciation of Bob Marley is needed."
2,The cling-ons have arrived,"Now I'm a HUUUGE Bob Marley fan, and I have all his works. I'm also Jamaican and have a deep undertsanding and appreciation of Bob. I wished this release had only included Bob's family, his children, The I threes's , and the other Jamaican singers like Jimmy Cliff etc..Because it angers me that people like lauren hill starts associating her self with Bob's legacy, of which she has no part.Well of course Ziggy, and the rest of the Marley clan being as gracious as they are will not say anything. lauren hill can go find another famous roots celebrity to jock-ride.Go away. we dont like you! Go do your little poetry thing over in ny. Go find a different artist to jock ride.For that reason i'm giving this release 2 stars. Bob , Ziggy, Rita, Judy, Marcia and the rest of the Marley clan and Jimmy Cliff and the Jamaican singers all gets 5 stars however.Too bad hill had to force herself up into this production. it leaves one with a sour taste in their mouth."
5,Busted,Yo! Busted is great! I picked up both of their albums while i was in England this summer & love both cd's! i know this one will be great...now all i have to do is order it!! lol Comedy+Great Music= Busted
4,Great Music,Hard to find on CD so I was glad to find it here; the CD was just as advertised and arrived earlier than expected. Totally satisfied with this purchase.
5,One of the better cookies out there,"Glutino Gluten-Free Cookies, Shortcake Dreams, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)These cookies are a real treat after trying some other brands. All of the Glutino brand products are very tasty, there are a variety of cookies that are all very good."
2,Dry,These are far from my favorite. At first I thought they were ok and I didn't realize what great good tasting gluten Free cookies are out there to buy.
5,A taste of Europe via North Texas,"Brave Combo takes traditional European music and infuses it with an American kick. From the back: ""This LP contains eleven polkas, two waltzes, and a schottische, performed in a variety of styles."" While accurate, the music on this album delivers a lot more than you might be expecting. If you thought the waltz and the polka were just for geezers in lederhosen, think again. You'll be ready to dance. And if you already think of polka as a reason to dance, get ready to have serious fun."
3,Okay but lacking,"Half of this album is great as WASP can be. Another half is not. I wonder about some track choices... Why two tracks from Helldorado and less from Headless, Still Not... and KFD?The Elton-cover is okay, but not great. Then we get the great stuff, Animal, first album, second album. Then We only get one track from Electric Circus and down we go from there. Several good tracks and whole albums get dismissed and then we get two mediocre songs from Helldorado. Not good.Overall, I listen to this album almost daily, but never to the finish. I always change the disc, or start again from track 1, when the album is nearing it's end."
5,Delightful Tin,"The tin is very delightful. I like the design. However, I just tasted dark treacle today, for the first time, and have no idea if it should taste this way. It's bitter, slightly salty, very thick, sticky, and sweet."
4,Very entertaining,"I also had to respond to the 1 star review. I have never read a Gilchrist book before, but am a huge fan of Stephen Pressfield's books and was inspired to read Green's and Kagin's accounts of the Greco-Persian and Peloponesian wars. I stumbled on this book by accident and found it to be tremendously entertaining. Yes, the characters might be developed more but I did not find this a serious distraction. I would compare it to Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea - some things are not fleshed out, but there are so many parts that are stunningly good that the book overall is quite worthwhile."
3,Good read,"This is a good book, and fun to read. It could use more and better maps so you can follow where he's going more easily. The pictures are postage-stamp size grainy black-and-white photos at chapter headings. There should have been one or more photo sections like many books have, with larger pictures.So 4 stars for the writing, 2 stars for the lack of maps/photos, average it out to 3 stars.If you're expecting a Bill Bryson style book that will have you giggling you'll be disappointed. This is more like a Paul Theroux travelogue minus some of the cynicism."
3,is the new filter defective?,"We purchased the new filter according to the size requirements online. It came on time, set up easily, etc. However, we have been having a constant problem with green water (algae on side of pool). We contacted Hayward and they said to clean the pool, empty the filter, put all new diamite in it (earth filtering material), shock it severely and it should clear up. We did all that and are adding one more shock treatment. If it doesn't work, there may be something wrong with the filter and I hope Hayward will stand behind their product.Will let you know.Angela M. Harting"
4,"Works great, but mine leaks! UPDATE...fixed, bad o-ring.","I purchased a DE Filter, even though the pool guys stated it would be too much maintenance! I have to differ as i love that I can just bump the handle 3 times, once per week, and my water is supposedly more filtered vs sand! However, my pump leaks where the lid tightens! i tried applying more pool-approved O-ring silicone and I still have the same problem. It leaks primarily when the pump is off. i can push down on the lid to minimize the leakage, but it has drained my pool to the lowest point on my skimmer twice since my purchased this summer! I don't see anything grossly defective, maybe just a poor design? I contacted the warranty dept at 1888hayward and they are sending me out a new o-ring and lid. I'll update my review if it is just a defective lid.Update, I was sent a new O-ring right away. Fixed!"
2,a very shallow character,I enjoyed the reminders of the fifties but I couldn't get past her shallowness. When one of her friends starts to date a boy that is out of their circle she suggests that her friends class finally shows. She is an avid reader but seems so unconnected to anything that is going on in the world. I don't think she would have been someone that I would have been interested in when I grew up in the fifties. I thought it was a story going no where and had a hard time finishing it.
3,I get it.,"I am not going to say much about this book. I had to read it for a class. In today's society, we get bombarded with ideas that it was really different growing up in the 50's compared to now. I think that this book is low on the substance with too many, oh yeah I can relate to that time."
2,Overly complicated...,"I was replacing a 2 year old Timex Expedition that was giving up the ghost and I have to admit the new 4 button format used by this watch is beyond me. Toggling back and forth through the time zones, getting the date to display vs the time, etc. is much more complicated than it needs to be.Overall, it's a nice looking watch and has a great set of features, but late at night with jet lag and needing to catch a flight a 6 am, I start wonder if I set the alarm in the right time zone, among other things.Finally, I start to wonder if buying a $40 watch every couple of years is more economical than buying a $150 watch and having it last a lifetime. So back it goes to Wallmart."
5,The Perfect Watch,"I have had this watch for years and years. First off it looks great. It has an elegant, high class look and feel, with a shiny metal link band, and metal casing. A beautiful blue backround with both hour and minute hand, along with a second hand. Yet it has everything you would expect from a digital watch: date display, digital time display, clockwatch, alarm. It took a massive ammount of beating over the years and heald strong. Now its time for a new watch, and I want no other watch."
3,Like most products on amazon,I like most of the products but the air temperature sensor is disappointing. The connector doesn't snap onto my civic connector. I reused my old sensor instead.
3,For citizens of the Red Sox Station (including me) but just that,"I share the lukewarm reactions to this book apparent in Amazon customer and press reviews. It adds little new but I am still glad I bought it. It doesn't live up to its title and is mainly just a straight chronicle of the Red Sox back office, including its squabbles and financial tergiversations. It has the merit of being hype-free and takes its subject seriously. It seems very fair-minded in its judgements about such personalities as Theo, Curt, Petie, and Manny and is very much centered on John Henry and the ownership issues but somehow the character sketches don't bring them to life.There's nothing wrong with the book and overall I like it -- and praise it with faint damns -- but I'm a Red Sox Nation member of over 40 yrs of neurosis. If you, too, are similarly of semi-sound mind, then it'w worth buying it. My only major criticism is that its comprehensive index does not contain a reference to ""Evil Empire."""
3,"Not nearly as much ""inside scoop"" as you'd expect","Reading all the pre-publication marketing and press, it seemed as if Mnookin was going to provide lots of inside, ""behind the scenes"" scoop from the front office. All of the author's blog entries and the bits and pieces released through the media indicated that. What this book actually is, is quite different. There is some of that stuff - and it's completely and utterly fascinating. But the vast majority of the book is a season-by-season chronology of the team's on-field performance from 2002 through 2005. Diehard fans already know what happened each season. We don't need a summary. What we do want is the inside story, the stuff Mnookin's special access was supposed to provide. Unfortunately, he didn't really live up to the hype in that area. It's still worth reading, just don't expect too much."
2,I have to give it two stars because I paid good money for the book,"...otherwise I'd look like a fool. If I'd waited until it made the best seller list I'd have gotten a discount, and then I'd have given it one star.I knew Mnookin was in trouble when he said that Garciaparra's .371 average was the highest for a Red sox player since Ted Williams batted .388 in 1957. I looked <everywhere> for something that made Ted's .406 irrelevant to the comparison, but couldn't find it. In addition to several factual errors, Mnookin is an awkward writer and does not choose words carefully. Clement was ""ushered off the field"" the day he was hit in head with a line drive? Things like that drive me nuts.Boring, boring, boring book.Someone should refer him to Michael Holley for a How-To-Follow-A-Team-For-A-Year-And-Come-Out-With-A-Great-Book Primer.Don't waste your money. Support your local library,"
5,Great!,"I bought this for a good friend as a gift. When she said she liked quotes, I knew the 'perfect gift' for her. I was right as she loves it. I have the original 'PQ' book and consider it the best quote book I have. If you like the way a great quote can condense a great 'Truth', advice, experience, guidance, wisdom into a small bite, there is no better book that I know of. Get it, be you a female or a male. Since we are from 'Mars', it helps if we learn a lot about the 'Venus' viewpoint. Can't let that ego get in the way."
3,A Good Read,"Drinkers of the Wind is an exciting story about adventure and life. I enjoyed reading the story. The main character Andrea grew and evolved through life experiences. Afghanistan seem to come to life, a good read."
2,cafe candles,I found that this candle did not leave much scent and also it burned so that alot on the top of the candles was wasted.
4,Marksman 1010,"This pistol performed better than expected. However, it was not without its flaws. The pellet seating tool didn't seem to work to great, as in using the tool to seat the pellet, the proceeding to fire the weapon did not result in the projectile in leaving the barrel. However, using the dart seating tool in place works fine. It will feed BB's reliably as long as you tilt it when cocking the pistol as to make sure a BB chambers."
4,Good enough for what It is.,"Well. I have to say 4 of 5 If this Is what you are looking for In a Repeater. It met all my standerds as to what I want. One warning though, I would not advise to use this in a match or battle. The haveing to reload by hand and so often makes It more of a pain then a pro. But haveing It just for poping can's or what not Its fine. Nice color, Nice proformance and for the most part a good gun."
1,horible,dont buy this gun. honestly your better off with a sling shot. if you really want an air pistol i would save up 10 more dollars and get a smith and wesson m&p 40 co2 bb pistol. this gun barly goes in cans if you can even hit them. the gun shoots so far off to the left and down its not even funny. and that is if it even feeds. you probably have a 40% chance its gonna feed. and cocking it is such a pain.
2,"A slow, weighty, attractive plinker","I've had this model for maybe 15 years, so trust that it's durable. It's hard to load BBs down the BB sized hole though, unless like someone said you have three hands, and preferably one of those is the size of a gecko's. I love the heft of the gun and the sound it makes when cocking it. However the visible arcing of the exiting shot quickly disipates any illusion that you've blasted anything. When firing, the recoil of the spring jolts the gun - enough so that you'll likely use two hands on it if you're aiming at a small target. As for the lack of power, I hit a rabbit in the butt using this gun from about 12 feet away. It turned around and looked at me, still chewing a mouthful of my hostas. ""Hosta"" la vista baby - NOT!"
5,On time with no problems!,"I received my book before I knew it! Overall, it was a great experience. Thanks! I would definitely order from this vendor again!!!"
5,One of my all time favorites...,Mrs. Piggle-Wiggles Magic was one of my all time favorite books as a child. I still have the book and read it to my children whenever I have the chance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone.
4,Mrs.Piggle-Wiggle's Magic is a funny book!,"I liked the book Mrs.Piggle-Wiggles Magic because it was so funny. I would recommend this book to all ages, especially if you like treasure. If you like the idea of building a house upside down you'll love the ending. If you love pigs you will think that this book rules. I liked how there was treasure in secret drawers hidden in the house. I loved the book. My age is nine (9)."
5,Mrs. Piggle Wiggle's Magic,I just got finished reading a great book called Mrs. Piggle Wiggle's Magic by Betty MacDonald. This book is about different problems that Mrs. Piggle Wiggle helped the kids with. Some problems were interrupting problems and other weird things. I give this book five stars because it shows how you should act and behave. I recommend this book to people that like fantasy. Mrs. Falco's mutlti-class By Richard J. Klisiew III
1,Not as pictured!,"The book they send is not the one pictured! I want the original illustrations by Hilary Knight; that's the book that was pictured, and the illustrator listed under the title was Hilary Knight. However, the book I received was the newer one with pictures by Alexandra Boiger. I have no idea why they felt the need for new illustrations in the first place, I love Hilary Knight's; they added to the charm of the quirky stories when I read them as a kid, and I still prefer them. I've had more trouble with Amazon not picturing the correct item and sending me what I don't want with these books! I give up. Amazon, hire a library cataloger and get some decent organization and control of your product listings! One star is for Amazon's performance, which isn't fair to the books. I loved the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle stories as a child, still love them, and plan to read them to my son! Funny, quirky, imaginative!"
1,mrs. piggle-wiggle the irresponsible pharmacist,"if you want your children to think that the""cure"" for any problem, such as daydreaming, lack of energy or hyperactivity comes in a powder or a pill, then ""Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic"" is right up your alley. if you believe in slipping mood-altering substances into your child's body is a good thing, here's your book. if you think children's shortcomings should first be treated with love, avoid this book and the rest of the Piggle-Wiggle books, which treat children like mindless [kids] that parents must trick into good behavior."
4,~Best Book Around Town~,The Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's series is about a children loving big-hearted lady who is always as happy as can be. Mrs. Piggle- Wiggle is always helping moms with there kids bad habits.From selfeshness to clumsiness Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle has a cure for it all. My Personal favorite of all the books is Mrs. Piggle-Wiggles Magic.This is my favorite because it was the 1st one I read and it got my into the Mrs.Piggle-Wiggle series. I am only 11 and I love the books for laughs but everyone could sit back and enjoy reading these books.Mrs. Piggle-Wiggles is also funny because like the whole series once you pick the book up you can not put it down. The Mrs. Pigglw Wiggle series is funny because the cures Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle comes up with for the kids bad habits.
4,Alot of hints of modern jazz in this ol' album,"This guy was really a great guitarist, and songwritter. On this album he has some of the most recognizeable jazz tunes ever, such as the classic 'yesterday'. This album really helps me close in the gap between old jazz, and modern jazz. He showcases alot of what was to come in the near future. This is a very good jazz album id recommend to any fan of jazz."
3,Teresa Ann Savoy,"The main actress of this movie is Teresa Ann Savoy. She is drop dead gorgeous, she is naked alot and she is in most of the scenes of the movie. The story is okay, the acting is just barely. But you do get to see Teresa Ann Savoy. She is drop dead gorgeous, she is naked alot and she is in most of the scenes of the movie. For this cinematic masterpiece, that really does say it all."
2,Dull Brass,"Interesting only because it was made by Europe's premier exploitation director, ""Kitty"" is tedious and has pretensions to being an expose of the Nazis. This film is nothing more than a forerunner of the Italian (...) genre that flourished briefly in the 1970's. As to the controversial and perverse elements - they are clumsily handled and pointless. You'll find more (...) readily available elsewhere and the horror of the Nazis is presented much more graphically and forcefully in movies by Speilberg and Polanski to name but two. If you're interested in a more thoughtful attempt at controversy from Italian directors with better artistic credentials, you might try ""Seeds of Evil"" and Pasolini's ""Salo: 100 Days of Sodom""."
1,More Tinto Brass soft porn.,"Three years after writing and directing this film, Tinto Brass directed the infamous ""Caligula"". While not as outrageous, ""Salon Kitty"" certainly doesn't have much in mind except to titillate the viewer.There is plenty of nudity but very little in the way of plot. From what I gathered, Helmut Berger plays a German officer. He concocts a plan to place recording devices in the rooms of a brothel. He plans to use the information he gathers to blackmail other members of the Nazi regime.At two hours, this movie really drags. As to be expected, none of the characters are people that you would care about. There are several musical numbers interspersed with numerous brothel scenes. Much of the film appears rather dark and some of it has a reddish tinge to it. All around it's a movie to avoid."
1,Yawn...,"Christ, this movie was so boring. I wasn't even paying attention towards the end. How did it end, anyway? Ah, it's not important. Stick to the classics: The Night Porter or The Damned. That acting is much better and things actually happen."
2,The plot is not original,This movie takes the original idea of The Balcony directed in 1963 by Joseph Strick. Salon Kitty is not a erotic drama. Is a bad copy of a great movie.
1,Salon Krappy,"Repulsive and disgusting is about all one could say about this film. Animal killings, violence, perversion, and garish exploitation of WWII are about all that can be found here. As UN-sexy a movie there ever was despite the way they try to package it. A colossal waste of time."
1,Really cheesy,Terrible movie. I was hoping for something with a plot. This was horrible. No plot and bad acting. Broke the DVD after 1 viewing mostly in FFwd.
3,"Informative, Good to give the 'rents","I used this book for a research paper. It looked at all aspects of tattooing, piercing and branding. It was informative and I would definitely give this to a parent that is fearful of a child getting a tattoo or piercing."
4,ANOTHER DISTOPIA,"Another distopian novel with a bit of a twist. Well told and nicely written. Charbonneau's first novel and probably his best. It uses the technique of taking modern problems and blowing them up into disasters. A fun read and a book I've kept for years. Old fashioned science fiction. Not on the level of 1984 or Brave New World or even The Space Merchants, but certainly as good or better than others of the ilk. Smacks of Sohl's Point Ultimate, which some critics hate or at best ignore, but has remained one of my favorites over the years. Easily as good as Logan's Run but for different reasons. I will not do a spoiler here. Read it for yourself and don't expect great literature. Just fun and excitment with a few chills. Accept it for what it is, and it's worth your money"
4,"Very good product, thank you very much","I am very grateful for this product because it had already time looking, thank you very much, keep it up"
5,BVLGARI COLOGNE FOR MEN,This was a gift for my son at Christmas and he just loves this scent. He usually gets this cologne every year.
5,Dad loves it,"Got it for Christmas for my Dad, its my favorite cologne and his as well.If you want an amazing smell that isn't overpowering but subtle and clean, this is the one!"
1,Return product code,"This product is still in USA, it can't fly outside for safety reasons, i need the return pack code please, for star the process in my package office."
4,MANY DIFFERENT STYLES,Bob James is obviously intelligent and does not rehash old favorites. This is completely new and very interesting. I was immediately impressed with seven of the selections and after a month I find myself checking out others. Buy it.
4,Every track is great,"There are very few CDs where every track is great, and ""Joy Ride"" is one of them. Just put it in and hit 'shuffle'. This CD has some very intricate piano pieces, none of which are too wild or take on strange tangents. Bob James invited several other professionals like Boney James and Fourplay to perform on the CD, making it truly amazing. This CD does not contain any of the slower ""Playboy"" style of jazz. All of it is clean and wonderful to hear. [Bass enthusiasts won't be disappointed; the bass lines are full of off beats and fills] If you're a fan of wonderful piano music, this ranks up there with Jim Brickman and Erik JoHansen. Definitely buy it!"
4,Core days are over but thats not a bad thing,"Amazing effort by one of the many bands that got me into rock music. No, this isn't Purple or Core and its nowhere near heavy as any of the albums. I think they concentrated on this record a little more than the seemingly rushed 4. ""Days of the Weak"" is a pretty catchy kind of pop song that was their radio so called hit. ""Coma"" seems that the band and Scott were doing two different things. The vocals don't quite match up with the instrumentation. ""Wonderful"" and ""Hello Its Late"" are by far the best songs on the record. Other tracks are pretty good but none leave the impression of these two tracks. I would try to find thish used but if you can't then i would recommend you just download the two tracks I mentioned before."
5,STP delivers another good one,I've been a fan of stone temple pilots since core. Shangri-La Dee Da is a great album showing that the band can still produce great music after all these years and struggles. The entire album shows the bands versetility from hard rock like dumb love to days of the week which is a lighter sound for the band.
4,Softer sides Vs. Heavier,"I actually preferred the slower tracks on this one... and fell pretty hard for them too. The heavier tracks are there but the softer the better on this one. Scott's vocals, Robert and Eric's jazz-lounge rhythms alongside Dean's talents sound absolutely superb in laid back fashion. Undeniably deep songs."
4,It's good but different!,"Shangri-la is good but very different from previous STP albuns...Some songs are amazing, some of the best they ever recorded like COMA, DUMB LOVE and HOLLYWOOD BITCH...But most of the songs are in a more calm vibe, very different from CORE or PURPLE...It's a good album but i prefer the earlier days of STP!"
5,Stone Temple Pilots - Shangri La Dee Da,"This is such a great yet underrated album by STP. It did not get much traction due to mismanagement and spiteful execution of the release on the part of Atlantic Records. SLDD has flavors of Core, Tiny Music, Purple, and No. 4, in addition to growth and great writing by the band. I would LOVE to see another album and tour from STP. They have proven many of the so called critics wrong and have created their own sound. Even if STP is not a favorite band of yours, this is well worthy of a listen. Warning, you will probably be hooked after a play or two."
5,Shangri-La Dee Da and #4 are extremely underrated albums,"I didn't really like this album or #4 at first. But they require repeat listens. The first time I heard core or purple all the way through I thoroughly enjoyed them. These albums require a bit more effort, but after you realize that they are not going to sound like their older stuff you can really appreciate these albums for what they are. STP has never made a bad album in my opinion. These albums are really amazing that everyone seemed to ignore and it's too bad.The Deleo's are so underrated. Army of Anyone was awesome and they just make amazing music and Scott is one of the best singers in Rock n Roll. He can be angry, aggressive and in your face, or sing beautifully without being sappy (which is hard to do). And Kretz drums always sound awesome, with a ton of weight and heaviness. This band is so versatile and original it's insane. Hopefully now they are back together they can make a new album."
4,Album grows on me more and more,"At first, I wasn't really sure if I enjoyed the album. It seemed kinda sketchy and is seemed as if the whole album was disconnected. But then I listened to it more and I started to enjoy the different moods and styles...none of the songs sound like each other, but they are all catchy and hold that capability to stick in your mind, depending on what your mood is. I think I like their second album best, but all of their albums are so different from each other that it's not a fair comparison. I think it's nice that they stick to whatever it is they feel like playing or writing, that's real art and it's nice to know that they aren't selling out on themselves. They are growing as people, and it's good to see that they reflect their maturity in their work."
3,another notch on the belt,"STP, such a great band, i feel hasnt lived up to their potential. Even though this cd does not stack up to their predasesors (no. 4) it is however, a good cd. I am probably one of the roughest critics around, but I commend Scott Weiland for pulling through the troubles he has encountered, and for making another work of art for my listening pleasure. I gave this cd a 3 because it doesnt have that, rough edged ""dont give a [damn]"" attitude STP use to carry. It definitly isnt an Aenima."
2,what happened to CORE,"I have just listened to SHANGRI-LA DEE DA and after the first listen I am very disappointed. The 13 tracks kinda sound the same and the production is poor. The songs are soft with no catchy riffs, the vocals are weak and the same throughout the disc, and the songs feel like they were hurried and not given the proper time to develop. Of the the 3 ""rockers"" Dumb Love is the only one that even begins to come close to the STP of old. If you are a rock fan like I am and want a great record like CORE dont get this cd but if you are into the more POP sounding music this is an ok disc. It does have some high points but it could have been better so it earns 2 stars at its best"
2,It's no wonder they didn't release another album after this,"On the special edition of ""Thank You"" I enjoyed the music clips that were played over the DVD menus. I found out that the music came from this album so I gave it a listen and I'm none to happy to report that Stone Temple Pilots fans won't like this album.""Days of the Week"" is alright. It's a catchy song and it gets you pumped for another album by them but the rest of the album is terrible. The music clips which I refered to are just the introductions to the songs which change after the first seven seconds into empty, yet overblown songs which don't have any replay value.Then, there's a syrupy ballad in the mix too which makes me lose a bit of respect for Scott Weiland and co. seeing as how it doesn't belong at all. I know Scott Weiland was going through a lot of stuff but c'mon, nobody wants to hear a ballad at that level.I definitely learned my lesson and that's simply that Stone Temple Pilots fans should avoid this."
1,2 thumbs down!,I listened to this one after i have listened to no.4I was extremely dissapointed.....this album gives you the sense of taking you somewhere but never does....it falls flat!This album is the complete opposite of no.4It sucks!
2,really bad -- go for the first four,"Save your cash. They are ghosts of their former selves on this album. I hope they make major improvements before their next. I would, however highly recommend any of their other records."
