5,Regarding study of music banned by 3rd Reich,"I know Michael Haas, executive producer. He has made a total commitment to locating and recording work of musicians whose work was banned by the Hitler regime because composers, etc. were even suspected to be Jewish, gay, gypsy, etc. One atheist or agnostic composer was sent to concentration camp because his father had been a Jew in the past.This is needed to give a picture of the survival of music by talented people under duress."

5,Great Basic Router,"Ive had this router for about 5 years and us it just about every day, repairs have been minimal also. When I visited one of my freinds at a local school they were using this router for making raised panel doors in 1 pass. Also for a tool to be able to survive at a high school it must be very rugged.The Router is light and powerful 10 amps vs Dewalts 9amps. Also there is abundances of accesories for this router, and if you need a plunge base you can simply spend 90 for a new one for this router, vs 180ish for a diecent comparable router. overall a great router ever one should have one."
3,In the minority,"I know that all the other reviewers ( even toolpig ) gush about this router. I know its popular, a classic, the industry standard . . . I just think it has a few shortcomings. This was the first router I ever purchased. I have had this router for about 6 years now, and it has worked fine. The downfalls are that it has alot of torque at start up that can be dangerous, the motor can fall out of the base fairly easily when installed under a table, and the power switch is awkward to access and hold the torquey motor while trying to fit my fingers into the switch guard. The handles seem too close to the base and the 23,000 rpm bit to one hand this router while turning it on or off. It has been trouble free and is well made, but it makes me nervous ! I'll buy something else, next time."
2,New Base A Day Late and A Dollar Short,"The 690 has great power ,moter can easily can spin right off it's base under a router table. Now pc has designed a new base lock haven't tried it yet ."
3,"Avoid getting bitten, stomped on or stung, and don't eat wild mushrooms!","I read this short (110 pages), tongue in cheek book, because the author, Buck Tilton, had written an excellent short book on first aid in the wilderness, ""Backcountry First Aid"". So since the reviews on Amazon for this book were pretty good, I decided to give it a read.The best that can be said about it, is that it is a very quick read, and it is mildly amusing. Tilton devotes a page and a couple of hundred words to 100 different outdoor menaces, from Cape Buffalo, and various sharks, to varieties of parasites and stinging insects. And he offers some basic advice, like avoid getting stepped on by rhinos, don't eat mushrooms in the wild, that sort of stuff. Each entry begins and ends with a witty aphorism or pithy statement.The book is OK, but as a genuine guide to avoiding outdoor dangers, has nothing particular to offer."
5,Under Three Flags,A well written and researched biography of a truly remarkable warrior and defender of freedom.
4,Happy...,"There has been some twisting with my shoes, but over-all, it's MUCH better than a regular cork pad. It works better with my more powerful Porter Cable than it does with my entry level Craftsman, so it may be the sander shoe that causes the shifting. Anyway, get one."
2,Lacklustre insight ... airbrushed production.,"A medium to large hall ambience smooths & smudges it all. An inappropriate production decision for these quartets.The playing lacks the emotional concentration & forensic insight needed - they have their moments but overall it just doesn't involve you like it should. The overall effect is of an airbrushed quality - the result is lacklustre.I grew up on the landmark 1960's Juilliard readings, so you may know where I'm coming from, and what I expect to hear. It so happens that is what works best for this music, which is why those are legendary performance recordings.After that these fall very far short. As Sony are still not re-releasing those classics, buy the Emerson Qt. recordings instead - they are of a similar quality to - and in the spirit of - the Juilliard's reading."
5,My Views,"Philips did a magnificent job with this LCD. The sound quality is fantastic. The black color is superb, the ambient light play a big part in watching movies and sporting events.The image and color is also great. This is one of the best LCD 32 inches around.Go for it..overall is fantastic."
3,Generally good information,"I recently checked this book out of the library in preparation of tanning a sheepskin. The book seems full of pertinent information, but it frequently seems scattered. You should definitely read through all sections as it seems tidbits of information in one section pertain to procedures of another section. Overall it seems there is a good variety of methods, types, tanning recipes and projects. This is the only book I've read on tanning, I feel educated on the subject but feel a slightly clearer, less scattered book would give me more confidence in approaching my first project."
3,Leaves a lot for you to figure out,"Plans and instructions are very basic. Plans and cut list did not match in many cases. Plans not entirely accurate. I'm using the plans as a ""general guideline"" and figuring out the rest by myself. No mention of recommended hardware (hinges, pulls, handles). No help on how to install the felt -- obviously from the picture there was some technique used but the plans say nothing about it. Most of the manual is about using a box joint jig for the table saw -- info that is more than abundant on the web."
1,Troubles!!!!,"I had my mower about a month and the T39 belt AND the tension pully broke!! T39 belt provides power from the engine to the pully that drives the mower blades. The lip on the side of the pully broke off!! Never heard of such a thing. A month later the belt broke again. Now, one month later the belt broke yet again.Also, the description talks about using to winch to raise the mower. No instructions on how to do that and couldn't find any attachment point to utilize it.Poor instructions on how to get the mower started.The ATV Quick Switch Utility System used to mount the mower to the ATV is a poor design. I had to fabricate some spacers so the pin would be level enought to hold the mower properly.Operator's manual is VERY basic, of little use for trouble shooting of problem resolution.When all is working it mows well, but oh my the problems I've had."
5,Love these dishes.,These are great dishes. I was a little worried about ordering dishes through the mail that they would arrive in pieces but they arrived all in one piece and I would recommend them to anyone looking for everyday dishes they are great.
3,good giveaway gift,good change from floral.not worth the price though. design looks broken as it doesn't start from very edge of the plates. wonder why didn't they/their designer think about that!?( they should hire someone like me ! haha!)some design on outer surface of bowl would have been a plus point rather than just simple lines on inner rim. mugs are the biggest disappointment. wonder why didn't they come up with colored mugs yet instead!!
3,Missing 1 Plate,"I ordered 3 boxes of this 16-piece, Chocolate Mint, and every single box is missing a ""6-3/4-inch Bread & Butter Plate"". It is the 15-piece set, not 16-piece set as stated.The color doesn't look so bright as seen in the picture but the color fade and not so sharp."
3,A missing plate!,"I ordered 3 sets of the dinnerware (so we would have service for 12). They arrived in 3 separate sealed boxes. Each box was missing 1 of the smaller (bread and butter) plates. Amazon customer service was great in helping with this problem, but the manufacturer should check the packages before they were sealed. The plates themselves are wonderful and would have been worthy of a 5 star review if the packages contained what they should have."
3,Not very impressed.,I got this in Lightning deal. The set looks dull and quality of cups wasn't what I expected. Its okay for the price.
3,Not really chip/break resistant,The product is not chip or break resistant as advertized. I used the plates and bowls for about 2 weeks and I accidentally dropped one of the plate and bowl and it shattered into very thin sharp pieces. Other than that the product is great.
5,very nice,I like this dinnerware set alot.and this is very reasonable price for this product. I am happy to buy it.
2,There's not much to this article,"The author talks about how a radio show got her thinking about what education is. After complaining about the radio show, she offers a few bullet points of what she thinks education should be. I tend to agree with the points, but she doesn't really develop them much at all. I think there are better developed ideas out there on most websites and editorials. The article is not all bad, just nothing I need to spend $1.50 to read."
5,Works great,This product is working as intended. Hooked it up to an Elk M1G and it has been great. No complaints.
3,"Mediocre, Uninspired","After reading the entire book and doing the exercises, I, with no prior Flash experience, was able to produce an intial, flawed Flash movie. But compared to the Dummies book (which I wish I had started with), this one has a paucity of examples (and like the writing style, impress as pedestrian).Surprisingly, this book spends way too much time on drawing fundamentals (""let's draw a house"" -- why?!), and details every menu choice with precious little in the way of context, examples and application. More a dictionary than a story.The Glossary was helpful, but I found the green type and green illustrations used throughout the book to be eyesores. And the very few sample Flash movies on the CD struck me as overly cutesy in concept--while being neither attractive nor imaginative--and more annoying than inspiring...."
3,The Grade school guide to Flash 5,"Flash 5 Visual JumpStart is a pretty good beginner's book for Flash 5. It teaches the basics like a high school text book, which may be too basic for professionals. My biggest issue with the book is the quality of the samples. They seem thrown together by a person with little artistic skill and a large collection of clip art. The color samples in the middle of the book are very amateurish, and I just can not see how anyone would be inspired by them.If you are a beginner, have poor eyesight and want to learn Flash from scratch, this may be the book for you. Professionals should stick to other Flash books."
3,Not recommending this book,this book looked easy to understand at the bookstore. but the truth is only the fonts and green icons are easy to view. its content is below average and many terms are explained like a substitute professor with little bit of understanding teaches at a college. Check this book instead; Macromedia Flash 5 Design: From Concept to Creation(ISBN: 0761527524)
4,Great book for Animation,"Michael August (mncaugust@home.com), a musician from Oceanside, Ca. Flash 5 Visual Jump start is a very easy to follow and informative book. The structure is outlined with easy to understand text, and pictures to make it fool-proof. What I also liked about it was the termanology used was great, especially for a non-computer animator like myself. I've checked out other so called easy to follow programs, and I like this one the BEST! If your looking to start animating, and have little to no experience, pick this one up!"
3,Great product bad delivery,"This is a great couch, especially for the price! BUT delivery was horrible! Be prepared to wait for weeks past the expected delivery date. My delivery date was pushed back at least twice.Now that we have the couch it's great, and it was worth it in the end. But if you don't have the time to find out where your couch is, then don't mess with this one."
1,Plain boring,"I liked 8 or 9 of Carlene Thompsons novels. Was really disappointed with ""If you ever tell"" and ""Since you've been gone"", found both books very confusing with too many characters.If you want to give Thompson a chance, start with ""All fall down"". I think it's even better than her first book ""Black for Remembrance"", because it creates such a great atmosphere.""The way you look tonight"" and ""In the Event of my Death"" are excellent.""Don't close your eyes"" is very well written.""If she should die"" has a very slow beginning, but after almost 100 pages it picks up and develops a humorous relationship between the main character, Christine Ireland, and the new sheriff which really cracked me up.""Last Whisper"" was very thrilling and recommendable.""Share no Secrets"" and ""Last seen alive"" are not bad, but not among her better ones.I still need to read ""You can run"", so I cannot say anything about that one."
3,Since You've Been Gone,"I have loved all of this authors books, this one isn't as good as her others. I felt she had too many characters involved in this story it was hard to keep my interest. I usually finish her books in a day but not this one. I did finish it and I guessed who the killer was, it was more suspenseful toward the end of the story."
2,Not so good,"I don't have much good to say about this book. The storyline of a young child kidnapped, and his mother's cousin who seems to have ESP was just preposterous. I've read and enjoyed books of this type before, but this one was just silly. Would people who were facing a situation like this, in light of the fact that this had happened before in their family and that child ended up murdered, be so light hearted about things? Going out to dinner, having parties and going on dates? Laughing, joking and seeming to be having a grand old time, except for the occasional bouts of ESP visions, and the murders of about half the small town. I rolled my eyes more than once, and kept reading only to see if I was correct in my guess as to the murderer/kidnapper (I was). A fast read but not worth the time."
3,Not nearly as good as BLACK FOR REMEMBRANCE,"I had previously read Thompson's BLACK FOR REMEMBRANCE so I was expecting the same quality in SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE, but I didn't find it. The story failed to really catch my interest and pull me in. It was your run-of-the-mill kidnapping story. The only thing that surprised me was the identity of the kidnapper/murderer."
4,Curiously suspenseful,"This was the first Carlene Thompson book I have read. It was not bad. Like another reviewer mentioned, there are plenty of suspects to keep you guessing up until the very end. The book did not blow me away, but was okay. I thought the book would be more of a romantic suspense, but it really was not. The characters are clearly infatuated with one another, but they only kiss once during the whole story, and nothing ever developed with that aspect of the story. Other than that, I enjoyed the book and will most likely read more of her books."
2,Interesting,"This book was a little different. It was good, but it seemed to lose its ""taughtness"" a few times. The theme of the missing little boy seemed at times to not be the focal point. At times we lost the thread of the initial storyline."
5,DON'T MISS THIS ONE!,"Page-turner with lots of twists! Carlene creates a likeable heroine with believable ESP--not the kind of ESP that supplies every answer just when it's needed. There is answer to an old mystery and a heart-stopping race against time to solve a new one.Carlene Thompson's characters are so life-like, including the heroine's cranky dog, Sean! I felt like I could almost see the town of Sinclair. Don't miss this one!"
5,Not Your Regular Paranormal,"When I began reading SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE, I expected the usual action-propelled story of a kidnapped child being tracked by a person with ESP. Instead, I found myself being drawn in by the complex characters, particularly the lead character Rebecca, but also by an intricate story line that skillfully ties present to past. Two thirds of the way through the novel, I was certain I had the mystery solved. I didn't. The ending was exciting and contained more than one surprise."
4,Channellock 815N Black Phosphate Wrench,"Product is incorrectly described as ""black phophate"" coated but is instead the chrome vanadium finish. Other than that, the tool arrived in excellent condition, on time and as otherwise described."
5,chocolate grahams,I was so happy to find these online since they are no longer available in my local markets - they are the best! AK
2,"Small is great, but this is too small!","I was given this laptop as a company issued computer, and I thought it was slick and cool. At first. Soon after firing it up and trying to type on it, I realized the downfall of this machine. The screen is too small (to be expected with a netbook), however the keyboard is WAY too small and unreliable. I recieved it with a broken space key (have to slam it down every time) and the tab key just flaked out on me. The battery life is nice (can usually go 4+ hours at this point in it's life), but it's slow and lacks an optical drive. And seriously, who uses the thumbprint reader?"
3,Somewhat disagreeable,"I do somewhat agree with the disgruntled fellow right below me - but not on all points (as if he (?)presented many). Never believe your first DMing experiences - they can be quite misleading. Now, about the Death Ascendant - it is not too bad, but better adventures can be found for this price. The overall plot is none-too-well developed and some areas are a bit shady. Maps are hard to read in places, and the villainous forces behind the scenes don't seem too sagacious. A mediocre flop, at its best."
4,Grandparent's yard,Places to play is what a grandparent wants.Ideas are great and easy to understand.
5,A must have for all Kiroro fans,If youre a fan of Kiroro then this CD is for you. One can just sit and listen to the music and never get tired. I was surprised to hear all my favorite songs and they are all in one CD!
2,Look elsewhere,"Not a good recording. Solti doesn't seem to have any new things to say on the greatest of all operas since his 1978 recording. The old cast had Margaret Price and Lucia Popp on the plus side, the new one only has Renee Fleming. Ann Murray is best forgotten, and Terfel is not really suited to the title role, he is a better Leporello. If you want a modern digital Don Giovanni get Sir John Eliot Gardiner's recording in ARCHIV. It has a sensational Donna Anna and Donna Elvira in Luba Orgonasova and Charlotte Margiono. Rodney Gilfry is a charmer, a high baritone suits the role best. Gardiner's conducting is very exciting, and musicologically well informed."
3,Move On - There are Better Don's!,"I purchased this recording based on my love of Solti's first 'Magic Flute' with the Vienna Philharmonic (Deutekom, Burrows, Fischer-Dieskau, Prey), which is absolutely without a doubt the best recording I have ever heard. Unfortunately, the complete recording is out of print....only highlights is available.The recording at hand is simply inadequate. Giulini's set is simply unmatched. I once read a review that said, ""we have a better chance of seeing pigs fly than a recording that tops this one."" Too true. If you don't care for Giulini, get the Davis or Muti sets, as they are both superior.Fleming is in beautiful voice, but everything else about this recording is sub-par, at best. The orchrestral playing is bland, the cast medicore, and the conducting - average.Get this set and you won't be hearing the true 'Don Giovanni'."
2,Good singers in the wrong places,"I think Fleming and Terfel voices are perfect for Mozart, but both are in wrong places. Bryn's voice is to heavy for Mozart's finest character to bariton voice - much better as Leporello or Masetto - prefer Fischer-Diskau and Rodney gilfry (the best Giovanni I have ever heard). Renne Fleming as Donna Elvira oght to be espetacular, but she as donna Ana is poor, I still prefer Gardiner's Orgonasova or Joan Sutherland (the two best Anna's of Mozart discography). Ann Murray is perfect as Elvira and Petrusi is excellent as Leporello, but the main characters (Giovanni and Anna) are realy to burst into tears, and not because I am happy with them. Sorry Solti fans, but I 'd better recommend his recording of Così."
5,Duplicate gift was returned for credit.,"This homedics massaging cushion is so good that I bought it twice for the same person. Unfortunately, it had to be returned this year. Amazon was quick to give me a credit coupon which I plan to use within the month. The recipient is so happy with the first cushion that he doesn't need to keep the duplicate. He would recommend this cushion to anyone who needs relief from back pain."
1,HORRIBLE SERVICE,"Never received the product because the website screwed up and kept my old billing address even after I attempted to change it three times. I contacted the seller through Amazon's link, never got a response, and then had to contact their service department. They said I'd get a refund then changed their minds and said I never contacted them with the correct address even though I did through Amazon. So they ripped me off out of $58 and I never got the product and now they refuse to respond to my attempts to resolve it. HORRIBLE SERVICE--I WILL NEVER EVER EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN."
3,Mosaic,The book has a very unique premise and interesting concept. The characters are memorable and it is an easy read.
3,3 1/2 stars,"With Mosaic, Maxim pulls together a solid, entertaining story. A steady, exciting pace keeps the pages turning from start to finish. Character development was quite good. It was easy to internalize the thoughts and motivations of a broad character set. With many of the characters having multiple personalities, however, it was at times difficult to remember who was who. That said, Mosaic is worth a quick read"
2,Author Trys The Impossible And Screws It Up,"I like most of John R Maxim's books (see my other reviews) but he has tried to do the impossible here. He's tried to write a book about the government wanting to use Multiple Personality Syndrome as a weapon. We not only get a lot of useless dialogue in this book, we also get it between the various characters that inhabit the same body. As if it isn't enough for the reader to try and keep the ""real"" characters straight...try keeping the characters within the characters straight as they interact with other characters within characters. Am I confusing you? You betcha! And this novel will do the same. I dislike stories that take place in asylums, as much of this novel does. There was no one to admire or identify with unless you have a yen to be a nut. Read one of Maxim's other books; this one was a bad idea poorly executed."
3,Mixed Bag,"The first 2/3's of the book were wonderful -- lots of suspense and a tease at thinking we might learn something about people with mulitple personalities. However, the last 1/3 this authors begins to give these people with mulitple personalities almost super-human qualities -- like mind reading and the touching of hands. Still enjoyable but not the best."
1,Please don't bother wasting your time...,"I had never read any of Maxim's work before, and this book introduced me to an author who really didn't take the time to research his material or think up a coherent plot and storyline.The characters are never developed sufficiently, the evil conspiracy behind the action is never explained, and the 'thrilling climax' involves the hero blacking out and doing nothing (sorry for the spoiler).I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. The beginning was moderately interesting, but the ending was a total letdown. Please don't bother."
1,Lilies of the Field,"I don't really like this book.I think it's boring, and not entertainning at all. All it is about is a guy building a church.Which nothing exciting happens."
5,"""...Indelible...""","I loved this book. It is one of the few books ever written about TRUE goodness of the human heart. Though only a 1-hour read, it is worth every minute. You'll come away from this book with a feeling of peace and happiness that you don't feel every day. So please, take an hour out of your busy schedule, and let this book capture you."
3,Good Book,This book is mostly teaching you to be helpful and to always respect someone who you just met. In this book Homer Smith is on the road and meets up with nuns who need help with everything. They wanted to build a church but needed help so Homer decided to help out. As the story went on they all got closer and freindly. But sometimes with their accent they sounded as if they were mad. At the end they build the church and Homer made new freinds. I think this book teaches a lesson to the young and is a very exciting book.
3,The Book is was a good book,"This book was ok. I read it with plaesure as I laughed at the accents of the German nuns and how demanding yet leniant they were. The book gives a strong feeling of how faith in god can put up a church as Homer Smith did in this story.The one thing that estonished me about this book was how the man Homer Smith kept working even after he found out the nuns weren't going to pay him for his work and that god sent him to help the nuns. I really thaught that Homer would have left the farm when he went back in the thaughts of being owned like a slave.This book shows a great sense of how much faith people put into the beliefs of god even though they don't base the book on it .I think this book could be read by anyone. It's an easy to read, short and educational story. If I was anyone I would sit down read it and grab a box of cockies to spare."
5,Wow. Lillies of the Field.,"Where do you start with ""Lillies of the Field?"" Now the video movie with Sidney Poitier is wonderful and timeless, but have you read The Lilies of the Field, the book by William E. Barrett?My wife and I were in the Parish Hall (built in 1868), and my wife loves to pick out books for the children from the library there. She came across this book. When I saw it, I had to read it; the movie is my all time favorite!Well, let me tell you that it differs from the movie in several areas. I read it cover to cover without stopping once. Without giving anything away, have you ever wondered where Homer Smith goes when he left the nuns for the first time?It is refreshing to say the least."
3,Lilies of the field,"Lilies of the field was an interesting story, but did not really catch my attetion. The moral of the story was nice, and so was the ending but still did not make me want to read it. I do like how the different cultures joined together, and the fact that the people really trusted in god. I also liked the fact that the book gave off a very inspirational feeling, but it still did not interest me. Although the book was written very well, I feel i wasn't so great."
3,SHORTY,THIS BOOK WASN'T AS GOOD AS OTHER BOOKS I HAVE READ. LILIES OF THE FIELD DIDN'T REALLY CAPTURE MY ATTENTION. I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY BORING. LILIES OF THE FIELD NEEDS SOME MORE ACTION AND DRAMA. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO IMPROVE THIS BOOK BY A COUPLE OF SCENES. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE REWRITTEN AND INSERT SOME IMAGINATION. LILIES OF THE FIELD SHOULD HAVE MORE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS. THAT'S MY OPINION ABOUT THE BOOK.
3,Lillies of the Field,"The book was okay I liked how differnt culture of people came together to build a church.At the end the church was done even when people thought the church was not going to be build by one man by himself but, other people helped also."
3,My Review,"My review of Lilies Of The Field isn't so great. I think they could have made it alot better. In the book Homer Smith does things that the reader already knows what is going to happen, like the reader guesses that parts in the book that are going to happen. Personaly I think that they should have put a little more sense into the book. In conclusion there were parts in the book that make the reader lose interest, you basically know whats going to happen and when."
4,Short but Sweet,"I enjoyed reading Lilies of the Field but it had a major flaw. The book is so short I read 3/4 of the book waiting in line. Though puting that aside, I enjoyed the book and its reasonable characters. Then again, the fast pacing of the book left me guessing about some of the characters. On a final note, I came to thinking that this book is, per se ""A mordern fairy tale"". I would recomend this book to someone wiling to sit and read for and hour(two at the most).-Matt"
4,It was a unique book.,"When I first picked out this book for a class assignment, I was afraid that I would have to make myself read the book, but I found myself wanting to read it fast, so I would find out what happened. At the begining, it was a little hard to understand, because of the German speaking, but I reaaly liked it and would suggest that you read it!!!"
5,How you think matters more than what you know,"Judging the possibility of future outcomes depends less on what a person knows (i.e. expertise), and more on how a person thinks. Best able to judge the future are those who see the world in fluid terms, embrace complexity and nuance, empathize with all sides of an argument, and seek out different opinions. Least able are those who see the world in black-and-white terms, tend toward dogma, hold to an idealistic view, and shut out others' opinions. Education and being up-to-date on current events were also required, but flexible thinking was the biggest variable. The book is extremely quantitative and deeply researched, but it is needlessly verbose in many places. Politics is the focus domain, but the principles extrapolate to other fields. Interestingly, the single most accurate predictor of the future was the autoregressive distributed lag function that the author used as a control, thus unintentionally showing the value of quantitative analytics."
1,poor writing judgement,"I perused the book. Tetlock colors everything through his prejudices - hedgehog vs. fox, an arbitrary partitioning among his respondants! He only exhibits heavily processed data. Plots graphs with coordinate labels that even the figure captions can't explain succinctly. The graphs offer no intuitive insights. He gathered questionaires from respondants but doesn't tell us the questions - only their nature! Never shows distribution plots of number of respondants vs their predictions. An obtuse, wordy and irrelevant book."
2,A disappointment,"Much of what Tetlock writes about is trivially obvious - why anyone would believe that political ""experts"" actually are experts is a mystery in itself. I expected a more polemical and combative work designed to destroy the obvious sham value of ""expert"" political opinion. I couldn't even be bothered finishing the book it was so tedious. This is not to say that others might be excited by Tetlock's insights.Peter HaggstromBONDI BEACH AUSTRALIA"
4,Excellent Networking Basics,"I knew a little about networking before I read the book, but have learned so much more now. The book starts at the most basic level, giving you a very broad background to networking. My only small criticism is that some of the technologies mentioned, are perhaps, a little out of date."
2,A Computer Reference Book from 1995 - Need I Say More?,"This was probably an excellent book when it was published, but as previous reviewers noted - as early as 1997!!! - this book is woefully outdated. Imagine my consternation upon finding that this was the required textbook for a college ""Introduction to LANs"" course I took last fall (2000)! This book is helpful, up to a point, but there must be newer books out there that would be even more useful."
1,Out-of-date,"As previous reviewers have stated, the book is out-of-date and error-ridden. Some have praised the book as being easy to read, but if the content is wrong it doesn't matter how well the book is written - It is still wrong."
5,The most beautiful piano music ever written,"Although I don't consider myself an ""expert"" of classical music, I do listen to alot of it and own over 500 classical cd's. Out of my entire collection, if I had to throw away 499 of them and only keep one, I'd keep this box set. Katchen plays so beautifully that I lose myself in the music every time and never get tired of listening to it.If you are considering buying this and are reading the reviews for informaton, don't hesitate - buy it NOW! You won't regret it."
5,very nice,"These are extremely high quality photos on very nice paper. It is like having a marilyn scrap book of photographs. I was very pleased.The paperback I have seen recently. It seems just as nice, but I bought the Hard back so nothing would get creased or bent. Favorite one so far. I am very picky."
5,Marilyn: A Life In Pictures,Excellent! Loved it! Marilyn was and truly is beautiful. Every Marilyn fan should purchase this book. You won't be disappointed!
5,Excellent,"Just the right size and exactly what I needed. Perfectly machined with zero play in the hinge, and I love the grips. As always, Channellock makes the best pliers."
2,"Good Product, Slow Shipping","The product is what I expected from a tungsten carbide ring. As I was replacing one I had lost. However, the shipping process was delayed for an in stock item. It took almost two weeks for the order to arrive. Would I order one again? For the price yes, for the customer service no."
1,Bad customer service experience,"I originally purchased the 8mm ring as a wedding band for my fiance, and exchanged it for the 5mm ring per his request. We were married 2 months later, and the ring turned out to be too big (not sure if the person sizing his finger wasn't accurate, or the ring was a little larger than a size 8). I requested to exchange the ring for a smaller size, and the company refused because I had already exchanged the ring once and 2 months had passed.Personally, I think 2 months for a man's wedding ring is acceptable considering the groom doesn't wear the ring as soon as it is received (who wants to fret over the wedding band arriving on time?). I also think that exchanging the ring once for preference and once for size is not terribly inappropriate, considering it's a wedding band.Granted, I can fork over another $20 for a different ring, but will certainly find it somewhere else."
5,Exaclty as expected,"I've lost three wedding bands. This is a perfect replacement. Looks good, has a nice heft, is comfortable, and is really, really inexpensive. Will buy again when I lose this one."
2,"Nice, but not scratch resistant.","I looked at tons of rings on Amazon for one that is more scratch-resistant and durable, and settled on this one for the color and supposed hardness. I ordered this tungsten carbide ring for my fiancee, in a size 6.5. The shipping was timely and the ring itself is beautiful- a medium dark blueish gray. However, the ring is NOT scratch resistant at all. He's worn it for 3 whole days and there are scratches around the entire perimeter of the ring. He does not have a heavy duty job (he's a bank teller and touches coins with the other hand) or rough lifestyle. I am disappointed in this ring and am thinking of returning it, although my fiancee still likes it."
3,A Value Purchase,"I purchased two of these rings, size 10.5 and size 6 on 14-AUG-2008. The 6 ring is flawless but the larger ring is very badly corroded. This started off with a dulling of the finish and then it slowly turned ashen and would not clean up to a mirror finish. Now, it hardly resembles anything like it did when purchased. I contacted the seller, Sabrina Silver and I was advised that since my order was so long ago, and the price was so low that I would have to get another ring and just take the hit. I was told that this is the risk you take with rings priced this low. (From the seller, mind you) SO, that's something to keep in mind."
5,Great Ring,The ring is excellent and you cannot beat the price. It looks like a very expensive ring. It was bought as an everyday ring since my husbands wedding band was a little big. Now my husband likes better than his very expensive gold wedding band.
5,LOVE!,"Great ring, looks wonderful. And best of all it does not scratch. My husband took a file to the inside to test it out and nothing! Great ring, great price can't get any better."
3,Very different from web image,"This is a very nice piece; good feel/weight to it, high quality--especially for the great price. Sadly, I am sending it back because the picture is pretty misleading. In the picture, it looks almost like white gold (which is what I wanted) but when you get it, the metal is dark. Other than that, it's a good looking ring, just not what I wanted."
2,nice in a way,"very nice shiney and heavy ring, thought to myself in my line of work this is the ring for me, until one day stand and talking to a friend the ring broke into 3 pieces. called the company I purchased it from and they said that it is comon for that to happen because they are so hard.they would not warrantee or refund money so not the ring for me."
5,Very Nice,"I was tired of resizing the wedding ring I was married with, but I still wanted to wear a ring. I found this one surfing Amazon, and liked the looks and reviews, so I tried it out. The ring is a really cool greyish color, depending on the light it can look black or light gray. It is very shiny. I had not worn a comfort fit ring before, my gold ring is a regular fit, this one is far more comfortable. The width takes a little getting used to, but it's not sharp like my other ring, I wouldn't go back. I used the method described on the web to determine my ring size, and based on the other reviews ordered one half size smaller, it's a perfect fit. The ring is fairly heavy, there is a lot of metal in this ring. I'm very happy with it, and wear it every day, I hardly know it's there."
2,I expected better,"Grealy wrote a good memoir, and I expected more from these essays than flip, scattered, often repetitive and chaotic musings."
1,just couldn't get into it.,"I just couldn't get into this book. Finally gave up and filed it away in my ""maybe another day"" file on the kindle"
2,Disappointed,"I was so happy to find another book by the author of Autobiography of a Face. I did not expect, in this book's early pages, to reread that memoir. I didn't engage in a side-by-side comparison, but it does seem that large chunks of her memoir were republished in the first few essays of this book. While some of the later essays make for good reading, a fair number had the feel of college papers gone awry.Grealy can't be faulted for this, but I have never before seen a book so riddled with typos. Shame on the editor!"
3,Fun and different writing style,I recommend reading 'Autobiography of a Face' first. I don't think some things in this book would make a lot of sense without the background of Lucy Grealy's life.
5,"Essays ain't usually my thing, but ...","How smart is Lucy Grealy? Witty, insightful, spot-right-on, I sit in admiration of one who writes so beautifully, so congently, so integrally. She is a poet, she is a thinker, she is cultural commentator. I recommend this book highly."
5,Works,Bought this to clean up the threads on a Saiga 12 bolt carrier when I replaced the gas piston. The new piston wouldn't thread in all the way at first. Once I'd chased the threads with this tap the new piston was able to bottom out.
5,Great Design,"This hand blender is a great design that is safe even when used with non-stick pots! Clean up is a breeze with the dishwasher safe,detachable blender shaft. With the coming cold weather, I look forward to making lots of soups that I'd avoided in the past because I hated pouring the soup into the blender."
3,"Well, the album was good.","Well the album was good. What happened? Sound's like someone messed with the equalizer in the mastering department and turned up the treble and bass too loud. The bass sound's great but, man! The distortion in the treble area's is worse than fingernail's on a black board! I was disappointed. The track's Danceland and Dance With You, distortion is hardly noticeable but, it's there. Alas, don't think we'll EVER see anotherpressing so, if you don't have it, and you know you like it, go ahead and get it. At least you don't have to deal with the scratches on the record particularly on Danceland. Thank you who ever you are for at least giving us Diva Carrie her Bestalbum ever on cd!"
5,Solar's Disco Darlin',"On the critically acclaimed 'Danceland,' singer and songwriter extrodinaire Carrie Lucas triumphantly soars on this brilliant masterpiece as one of R&B/Dance music's brightest stars. During a time when it was alright to let loose and dance the entire night away, fans looked to divas like GLORIA, DONNA, VICKI, AND ANDREA for answers, but with hits like the seductive ""Dance With You,"" ""Are You Dancing,"" and the album's energetic title track, it proves that not only is Lucas all in a class herself but that she can hang with the very best of them. A voice remarkably dynamic, Lucas delivers with great impact on the heartfelt ballad ""Sometimes a Love Goes Wrong,"" that includes help from labelmate pals the Whispers."
3,A Good Start,"This is one of her earlier books 1989-90. Delilah's father is going to write his memoirs. She is trying to get married and her father is an""infamous rake"". Delilah is trying to stop the publication of the book till after she is married. The story starts out entertaining but gets bogged down about two-thirds through. OK, why would you read this book, let alone buy it? The same reason I did--you like this author and want to read her earlier stuff. As you read it you can she how the author is developing the style she uses later in her other books.There's no sex other than kissing and some fondling. I like Lord of Scoundrels, the Last Hellion, and Captives of the Night in that order, I didn't like Lion's Daughter. Hope this helps."
5,I seriously loved this book,"What a great regency. I absolutely loved the fact that the H was bookish and not the usual type, it made him all the more brilliant. I loved the unconventional and passionate h. The story started a little slowly and at times I was a bit irritated that the H didn't have more to do with the h. However the second half of the book was so good and so worthwhile. I adored the h's father, he was fabulous and all the things he said had me laughing out loud."
4,well worth reading,"This is slightly uneven, but well worth reading. I like the bookworm but manly hero, and parts of the novel are hilarious.I hope there is a book about the heroine's parents.Excerpt:Jack rose as she entered, then was nearly knocked back down again, for she threw herself at him and kissed him so soundly she nearly dislocated his jaw. ""Stop that, Delilah,"" said her mother. ""A young lady does not leap upon her beau like a savage upon the poor beast he's just trapped."""
4,I love Loretta Chase,"This is one of the earlier Loretta Chase novels before she started having stronger sexual references and scenes in her novels. As such it is pretty tame however if you are looking for stories well told, with strong female characters and interesting three dimensional heroes then Chase is your gal. I have all of her books and if you love the Regency period you should definitley read Chase."
4,Wonderful,I really enjoyed this book. The heroine was funny and smart. The conflict between the lovers was believable and I also think intriguing. I wasn't a big fan of the lack of back story but the flow more than made up for it.
3,(2.5 stars) A so-so Chase book from 1989.,"I love Loretta Chase and am enjoying this opportunity to read her old Regencies on my Kindle. This one, however, from 1989, is my least favorite of her early work. I have enjoyed much more herKnaves' WagerandThe Sandalwood Princess. THE DEVIL'S DELILAH was tedious to read. The plot, what there is, advances too slowly and I found myself wanting to skip sections. That's not a good idea with Chase because there are always humorous gems to be found in her prose. Unfortunately, this time the gems did not make up for the tedium. I still rounded to 3 because, well, it is Chase, and there are some enjoyable moments to be found."
4,The Devil's Delilah,I read everything Loretta Chase writes and have been reading her for years. She only improved over the years. She has a good sense of the Regency period and her plots are good. I would recommend this book.
2,Too much fluff,"Starts off intriguing, but for me it was like wading though molassas. The going was ponderous. I didn't like Delilah much, she was erratic in her personality. Full of piss and vinegar one minute and blushing coyly the next. So beautiful and resourceful that the men around her became stupid. The male leads in this story were too prissy for my tastes. Their dialog so trite and silly that I had to skim over most of it. Not really a romance either. Even though I like Loretta Chase's writing style and her ability to turn clever phrases, can not recommend this one - unless you really like light reads without much subtance."
5,Sublime,"There is nothing like the pure sound of an acoustic guitar. This is simple, clear, honest and real strumming and picking. You get lost in the vibrations of those strings. Let your imagination take wing!"
4,This thing motivates stock!!,Obviously it was made in china so alot of the parts where loose upon arrival shipping took about 4 months from purchase not boughten from amazon but after tighten everything i got it to 40 and i was just feathering it in 4th this thing is great and i love it has some flaws like rough shifting but its definatly worth it for the thrill of it
5,wowser,great tool!what a time saver.much easier to use and great leverage for securing ends on all sizes wire.
4,"instant losses, not instant gratification","Royer is quite right. Internet gambling is one of the key moneymaking areas of the Internet. [Along with porno sites.] The biggest problem is that US citizens are barred from patronising such sites.He describes how the online aspect can lead to instant gratification. Well, actually, the prospect of such. In practice, of course, the player loses, on average. So it really is instant losses.But unlike real, physical casinos, an online casino has much less labour overhead. And no need to build a billion dollar edifice in which your customers play. So an online casino has some advantages over its offline counterparts. It also has disadvantages. Of those gamblers who go to Las Vegas, for example, many do so for the physical experience. Like being in a group, going to a different town, seeing the floor shows and so on. So both types of casinos will co-exist."
1,Very little useful information!,Never really explains the rouge casinos. How to avoid them. So many people are traped by them. Also the information that is contained in this book is not all that current. My advice is look carefully and beware when you open up an online gambling account. The author does not provide you with much help in this area.
3,Felt kinda fluffy to me,"From the back cover: He vowed to cherish the wrong sister. Mary had always wanted a family - a real one, in which she could love and cherish and be cherished in return. But when her father conned her into stalling for time at her twin sister's wedding, Mary never dreamed Margaret wouldn't show up as promised to take her place. The groom accepted the switch philosophically. He needed a wife, a mother for his daughter and he wanted a son. And although he didn't necessarily love her, Mary found herself hoping that Margaret wouldn't turn up to spoil things.MY THOUGHTS: the back cover kinda tells you what the book is about already. I am so-so on it. The story just kinda felt light and fluffy and I didn't really like the way the hero sometimes called her ""Miss Mary"" it just sounds like yes, Ma'am, etc. etc. It was alright, but I probably won't read it again. I only read it coz my Mom lent it to me."
5,Most Comprehensive,"As the Author of this book, I would like readers to know that the 10 top sales performers featured are from 10 different countries, involved in 10 different industries. In the personal interviews I did with each person, I selected the award winning techniques which can be applied IMMEDIATELY to any industry anywhere. Each chapter ends with an Action Section that allows you to adapt the key points to your specific needs.....Through each chapter you gain important insight and build a personal relationship with each top achiever, seeing behind the scenes into their methods and reasons for doing what they do......As one top achiever said to me, ""Anybody can do it, Christine, anybody can do it."" He is right. I've had letters from all over the world. The blueprint is there in the book. Adapt it to your needs and run with it. Let me know how you like it or if you are a top achiever to be featured in my next sales book - ... GOOD LUCK TO EACH OF YOU."
5,Hysterically funny and true to real life.,"Marion Winik never ceases to amaze me with her candid and heroically revealing writing. She can evoke so many emotions about diving into that great big pool of love we call 'Family'. As a nanny, I have had so many Mothers ask me, ""Am I doing this right""? And, ""Do you think I'm a good Mom""? I try to stay neutral and tell them that it doesn't matter what I think, it matters what THEY think. Then I reccomend Marion's book and I always get VERY positive feedback about it. If you're a Mom; past, present or future, this book will make you feel a whole lot better about all that that entails. Your life won't be complete until you read it!"
4,Mixed Emotions,"First of all, I give all the credit to this seller. I had purchased this item somewhere else. After THREE WEEKS of waiting for the other company, I chose to purchase from this seller. Within TWO DAYS the item was shipped. I was extremely impressed with how fast it was shipped. The only negative thing I have to say was that the book was supposed to be in used-good condition. However, the book is falling apart. It is being held together by scotch tape. There are notes all over (which I expected from a used book). There are tons of pages either ripped or broken. It is not in used-good condition. But hey, a book is a book, especially when you only need it for one semester! Besides that, everything with this seller was great!I would highly recommend this seller to anyone who wants quick service!"
3,My experience purchasing this item,The product is pretty good and good looking. I found two issues:1)the front whells are not able to turn so I think it will be difficult to be ride smoothly.2)Is pretty big to use in stores or at home.
3,Schwinn Hope Jogging Stroller,"I am a bit disappointed with this stroller, as it does not have a front wheel that swivels, thus making it difficult to turn. Otherwise, the stroller is very sturdy and provides a smooth ride. Just wish that making turns was a little bit easier."
5,Great jogging stroller,"I am very impressed with the quality and well thought out features of this jogging stroller. As for the negative reviews that I have read, they honestly don't apply to this product.... A jogging stroller is just that; a stroller that primarily travels in a relatively straight line, therefore the need to ""turn easily"" is not required, unless of course you jog in circles. Here's another hint - the faster you jog, the easier the stroller turns - Physic 101. If you are looking for a stroller that can maneuver through crowds in the mall, buy either a conventional stroller or one with a front wheel that swivels."
2,Did not like,"I was very unhappy with this stroller. It seemed very flimsy and cheap. My daughter is 39lbs and it was way too small for her. Love the look and it handled ok, but just overall disappointed."
2,Didn't last 8 months...,I fell in love with this stroller online and I had to have it for my first baby girl. The stroller came and it looks great and rolls wonderfully. My mom and I walk approximately 4 miles at least 5 times a week. The stroller's front swivel wheel didn't handle well with the speed that we walk. We were fine leaving the stroller's front wheel in the locked position and walking that way when exercising. Unfortunately the front wheel wouldn't even swivel properly for a casual walk. After getting over that I still enjoyed the look of the stroller and the way it did handle when the wheel was in the locked position. After 4 walks the awning snapped. We rigged it together with an earring because there was nobody to contact about this stroller purchased on Amazon. My daughter is 8 months old and just yesterday the entire awning snapped and is completely broken. I am frustrated and I am not recommending this stroller to anyone!
4,Everyone needs a pair of these for their toolbox,"Fits in your back pocket comfortably; great for cutting zip ties, wire, etc. They hold up well and perform well. We use these in the shop so i decided I needed a pair for home too."
4,Really beautiful,"This cd is totally acoustic no synths at all. That is departure from his older albums where it was a mix of synths and real instruments. The lyrics and vocals are just as moving as ever. The music sounds pretty similar to what was produced ealier and is just as beautiful. It does have that little bit of a real tinge to it though.Some of my favorite tracks of the album:Second Best - A very good start to the album. It was by far my favorite song from Brian's ""Bad Song of the Week"". Very strong lyrically and the vocals are great. I really love the message of this song. Very awsome.Realist - I love the flute and piano on this song. Really amazing.Something Beautiful - I like the lyrics here. As always Brian writes awsome songs.Covering Up Your Tracks - Awsome instruments, with the flute returning. The flute takes me in hook, line, and sinker, I love the instrument.Do yourself a favor and pick up this album!Nothing wrong here just some more solid ""piano-pop"" for the 21st century."
2,applesauce through a straw,"i came across this cd from a rufus wainwright reccommendation. imagine a well coiffured member of your local 12 seater church releasing an album. it would have technical merit, yes, but sitting through a cd of ultra-corny vocal and lyrical emoting would lead you to urges of tracking the man down and gleefully beating him out of his cardigan with a bag of nickels. vocally, this sounds like clay aiken's suspiciously feminine 8th grade audition, dave gahn's anemic younger brother who drinks applesauce with a straw. there are some nice piano compositions, but the entirely serious squeeled teenage poetry completely deflates it."
5,Simply Brilliant Record All Should Own!,"Friends in Danger is an absolutely amazing album, which shows great depth, variety, power & emotion. Love the unique guitar sound & Adalita's vocals are especially good. A simply amazing & unforgettable album, from a teriffic Aussie act!!! :-))"
4,dgb,"this album Rawks. unfortunately they've ""broken up"" since to start a new band called Sons of Daughters. But Darryl's Grocery Bag showed that the western Canadian punk scene could hold its weight with this album. It's crunchy guitars remind me of Through Being Cool by Saves the Day, and the melodies are definately their own. All the songs on this album live up to a standard of great music. They're catchy and fun. If you get a hold of a couple of their b-sides after this album, you would see that they were taking more of an emotional effort into their music, which could only give for even more. But we'll have to see what they can do with the new band."
5,"Been there done that, now to teach the kids","Yea it's one of those No-Nuke files from the 80's but if you lived during the cold war it is full of facts and fun memories. I got the film for my kid who was studying the Cold War. I can tell her some of the tales of the era but this film did a better job. If you ever had to crawl under you desk in grammer school during Atomic Bomb drills you will enjoy the film. If ""duck and cover"" wasn't drilled into your head as a kid you will get blast learning why all of us who did are ... let's say have an odd sense of humor. Fun film for all and fun way to help the kid learn history"
4,Humorous and revealing,"This documentary has very entertaining footage that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. It sends shivers down your spine when you hear what public officials were saying during early days of the cold war. Many times there were references to the ""will of God"" in the same sentence there were references to nuclear weapons and testing and it just horrified me. Looking back it all looks very silly but people took themselves very serious then. Today we take ourselves very serious. It makes you wonder how we will look back on ourselves at this current time. What are we going to think, in the future, of our current speak of profits and competition, of downsizing, corporate synergy, aggressive advertising promising that some product will make us happy? Or, will it be something else that we will cringe at the sound of hearing?"
4,It's Finally on DVD!,"I am gratified to see that this film is on DVD. Michael Weldon, author of The Psychotronic Film Guide, calls this the most important film ever made. I'm not sure I'd go so far as that, but this is a good film.Few of the other reviewers have commented about the actual content of the movie. It's a documentary with little (or no) narration which pieces together newsreel and archival films to contrast the stark destructive reality of nuclear weapons with the insipid optimism of 50's Cold War propaganda. Apparently this theme is lost on a great deal of viewers including the US Air Force; you can buy it at the National Atomic Museum gift shop.Another reviewer commented on the bad music on the soundtrack. In fact, this soundtrack is just as important a historical document as the film itself. It was the very last LP record I ever bought in shrink-wrap. Now that the film is on DVD, it's time for the soundtrack to come out on CD as well."
5,it lets you laugh at how stupid we all were,"the greatest movie i ever saw in school, i like it so much, i watch it at least once a month. it is truely a mockery of the intellegence of the nation, which you can't help, but laugh at ourselves. i wake up every morning singing about bert the turtle, and all day i laugh with my friends about all the clips through out the movie. it is something to definately frolic over."
3,Useful teaching tool,"As a teacher, I found the collection of historic video documents helpful. The clips found in this docudrama are obsolete and hard to come by. The writers of this ""movie"" inject a sense of humor as well as a good dose of irony."
4,Buffs will love it!,"For the lover of atomic ""mania"" this is a must, if not, this not too interesting. But a real must see for those that know what 'duck and cover' means."
3,cold war paranoia,"I am a little too young to have experienced the ""duck and cover drills"", and it was interesting and sad to see what Americans put themselves through because of their fears back in the 1950s. I only gave the film 3 stars because of a terrible animal abuse scene (pigs) and because of that I won't watch it again."
1,"Dr Strangelove without the creativity, script, etc.","This is a cult flick, won't argue it. It's also overly long, often boring and even though it's using no original material whatsoever, the juxtapositions and thematic polarization of what is used often combine into the pretentious and overbearing. If you're IQ is above 120 or so, expect to have your intelligence frequently insulted (the nudge, nudge variety of ""get it? get it? isn't nuclear war bad? ain't these people creepy?"" underlying messages). It can't touch the depth of a, say, Koyanisqatsi. Over-rated."
4,a frightening and humorous look at cold war propaganda.,This tape is both a humourous and a scary collection of government training films that deal with nuclear war. It shows how the U.S. Government has in the past lied to it's citizens. Most of the films in this collection are about how to servive a nuclear war. The advice is so bad it's laughable. END
5,WOW!!!!,"This movie is a mind-blower. Not being a child of the Atomic Age (I was born in the '70s), I wasn't exposed to any of this stuff when I was a kid. But I guess it was always there, in a way. You know - ""Don't worry! The government can handle anything."" There are moments when you laugh, and quite a few that tug at your heart. The juxtaposition of sound and image is simultaniously spooky and funny. The song ""Let the H-Bomb Fall"" fades out, and we see the nightime shot of the demon-orange glow of the Castle-Bravo test explosion. Even the plain white text that the dates and explosion names are put in gives me chills. And say what you want, but the Bikini Atoll explosion is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. Amazing. Particularly good is the end, where the filmmakers use all this footage to create the end of the world.It might be said a lot, but if you love Dr. Strangelove, you HAVE to get this movie."
3,Lackluster Remaster,"All the material is here from this 1980 Solar Records LP but the sound is less than stellar. It sounds as if Unidisc (the Canadian import re-issue company) who is usually very consistent with re-issuing material that the original companies have stored in their vaults for all eternity, took this from a battered cassette tape or even 8 track tape for that matter. If you really like this album and want to hear the sound in a much purer form, try to track down the original LP if you can, I did and I am glad for doing so. Even the cover art was given some new fonts through our new computer age for the cd re-issue. Why? Beats Me....Good Luck"
3,HYPERBOLE IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE,"The stereotypical characters and the lengths to which they will go in the game of ""one-upsmanship"" are not confined to the world of the academic. Look around folks! The power hungry thrive in every walk of life...politics, industry, etc. Everyman seeks power in his own little world.To truly understand and enjoy most of the literary allusions and nuances in this book, one must be either an academic, an English lit major, or both. This is definitely not a book for the ""man in the street"". (It could, however, qualify as an example of seeking ""power in your own little world""......as in ""only we who have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of literature will be able to understand all the subtle ""inside jokes"").Finally, the ""Twilight Zone"" quality of the final few chapters leads one to question if Nelson Humboldt wasn't really suffering from schizophrenia and had gone off his meds."
2,The Devil Is in the Denoument,"If I only had the first half of this book to read, it would earn an easy five stars. The descriptions are familiar, the despair understandable, the topsy-turvy heirarchy both funny and poingnant. I laughed, cried, and cursed in the early parts of this book, in sympathy, empathy, delight and disgust... But then the book got silly. It wasn't just about Nelson's power, it became something past parody to utter stupidity. The last third of the book is not only unconvincing, but also bizarre. It lacks the robustness and reference that the first part of the book has. I'm sure someone could make a parallel to an academic life, but I was turned off by the time the library was burning down. I suppose this book is worth reading, but the first part was an absolute joy, the last part a chore."
3,A Promising First Half But...,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer from Washington, D.C. This is a caustic and intelligent novel that shows tremendous promise in the first half, before it dissolves into total parody and absurdity in the second half. It's as if Hynes is trying TOO hard to tie everything in...and it shows! I eagerly turned pages at first, fascinated by the English Literature references and the fresh, innovative style, only to be frustrated as the novel wore on. So much promise but..."
3,Inside jokes,"This book is about academia, and in some ways, reading it is an academic exercise. I've been to college, and I'm in graduate school (not for literature, though), but a lot of this book was over my head. I'm not familiar with modern lit theory and had to look up some of the terminology.That said, the story itself is great. Very interesting, the plot kept me going when I was in danger of being bogged down in ""critical gender theories"" and ""tenure tracks."" Hynes is wonderful at developing characters, and the ones in this book are rich and complex. The surreal nature of the plot is reflected in some pretty trippy incidents that occur throughout the book.Overall, I'd highly recommend The Lecturer's Tale if you are a Lit grad student, and just moderately recommend it if you aren't."
2,Verbose,"After way too many years in academia, I did find myself laughing at some elements of The Lecturer's Tale. But really, there's nothing new here. Who doesn't know that those who fancy themselves the academic elite are, well, elitists? I found the satire to be more the level of a lampoon, and the academic charicatures weren't really worth my time. The story and plot were good ones; however, the author's heavy-handed attempts at satire resulted in verbage that had to be waded through rather than enjoyed."
3,"Satire, A+. Horror, B-.","Hyne's visciously funny satire of academia is brilliant and incisive. The first section of the book found me laughing out loud quite frequently. However, as the plot took over and the supernatural finger became more and more wicked, the book lost me. The bizarre rantings about gender identity during the book's climax lost their satirical edge for me and became as ridiculous as the people satirized in the books opening chapters. The book is very clever, and will definitely entertain anyone who has worked in academia. For this reader, though, the plot didn't live up to the brilliant characterization."
3,"Glad I Came Across This Book, and Happy to Have Read It","I just randomly picked up this book, because the author has the same surname as mine. However, I undoubtedly, might have gotten more out it, if I were in the world of academia. Since, this is not the case, it was quite a struggle for me to get through many of the parts. But Mr. Hynes's book was by no means a waste of time for me, it was a thoroughly good experience and a privilege for me to read a wonderful piece of literature.Incidentally, this book was not put on on my bookshelf to be forgotton, it was passed onto a close friend of mine who is well ensconced in the world of academia, and she was delighted to receive this piece of literature."
3,Couldn't finish this book,"The first few chapters were entertaining, but you have to believe in the awful plight of the white male academic - which is hard for me to do.Plus, there are so many literary references, it's tiresome. This is a great book for those entrenched in academia, but for mere mortals, it's a boring, tedious read."
2,Exaggerated Fiction in Academia,"This book was reviewed in the local paper and the review made is sound like an interesting tour thru academia. Some of it was; but, all in all, the politically correctness of the characters was exaggerated to the extreme. I am sure that somewhat similar people exist here and there, but to put them all together makes for pure fantasy.Hynes character description is detailed and very humorous. Without this I would not give even a two star rating. Also his ""one liners"" bring on a chuckle.The ending borders on the ridiculous. Perhaps it had a deeper meaning than I was able to fathom, but male and female bodies interchanging, spirits (or someone) jumping off a parapet. academics having a free for all shootout on a lonely campus, towers collapsing in a conflagration, etc., etc. How much liberty can an author take with fiction. I am sorry I wasted my time reading this."
3,If you like Inspector Morse...,"Malice in Cornwall reads much like the Inspector Morse or Wexford TV mysteries. Rather than an opera loving Morse, Graham Thomas has created Erskine Powell and his sidekick Detective-Sgt. Black who banter literary quotations back and forth. The Black character comes across as amusing. Powell isn't quite there yet - as a character, I mean. I don't think he has a personality strong enough for a series.The mystery is straight forward. Plenty of digressions on Cornwall and the food Powell and Black are served. Is this a good thing or not?The final paragraph was quite good. But I won't quote it here."
3,If you're a fan of M.C.Beaton...,"You will probably appreciate this authors prose, but will realize this is not the easy, light-hearted engrossing read the Hamish McBeth and Agatha Raisin series are. But, the story is intriguing, once you get into the book. If you do wish to read this, be careful of a prior review; it just about tells the entire plot. NOT appreciated !"
5,Just as expected!,I love it! I get to pick a discontinued recording at great value and have it delivered at my door step in a few weeks. Life is good.
4,6 pocket pleasure,"Well made and solid belt pouch. I really like the size of it and the fact that it maintains it's shape. For me it holds just the right tools making them easily accessible but out of the way. A tape measure has to find another home on your belt but that's no big deal. It's great for a couple screw drivers, pliers, scraper, knife, pencils and the big pocket will hold a small power drill driver comfortably - or anything else you use a lot. Plus its easy to dump all the saw dust and junk that collects in the pockets. I use it more than any other belt I own."
5,Fantastic Book,"I have viewed hundreds of cookbooks. This was the first ""Mr. Food"" book that I purchased a year ago. Simply stated, this is the best cookbook I have ever used. I have prepared so far about half of the 175+ recipes in it, and they have literally all been fanstastic. They are easy to prepare also (just as he claims). From appetizers to elegant main courses to desserts, I have received numerous compliments. This is such a good book that I have just ordered the best of Mr. Food I and II."
5,"Great recipies, very easy to follow","I will admit it, my husband does more cooking than I do. He is a better cook, can make his own bread, pasta and can even cook without a recipe. When I need to cook for the family, I use this book. It is simple and the recipies frequently require things that you already have around your kitchen. I plan to buy more of his cookbooks."
5,great!,My kids love this vanilla milk. It is great to be able to pack milk without worrying about the refrigeration
1,Horizon is not considered organic,"There is a national boycott of Horizon products as they are not organic. This company was sold to a large conglomerate a few years ago. Horizon is practicing ""Greenwashing"" - where a company claims to be sustainable, green, and organic but really is not. Many Co-ops and local health food stores are boycotting Horizon products, including PCC Co-op in Seattle (largest co-op in the country)Please do some research before paying organic prices to a bogus company."
3,Amazon canceled Subscribe and Save,Amazon abruptly canceled my subscription. I used to received two packages a month and the price steadily raised about %40. It's not too bad since my son now drinks regular milk with Quik chocolate or strawberry. I save some money as well so it's worked out for the better.
2,BEWARE!! Double the sugar of regular milk,We used to think this was a healthy product until we noticed the sugar content. This is almost liquid ice cream... If you want to avoid the extra added sugar buy only the PLAIN milk boxes
2,The package redesign is terrible,"They recently redesigned the packaging for these; instead of a foil tab that you pull up or punch through, you have a foil-covered hole just barely big enough for the straw. Want to pour it into another container, such as a glass or a sippy? Find yourself a pair of scissors. Your child pushes the expandable straw in? Find those scissors. It's a horrible design, and when I pointed this out to them I was brushed off with ""our testing showed this was better."" I'm wondering if anybody who works there is a parent of a little kid.The milk itself is good, but this packaging just makes it a royal pain."
1,can of coke,"these milks have nearly as much sugar per ounce (and in volume) as a can of regular coke. each small drink has just under 75% the sugar of one larger 12 ounce soda. this is not a good 'snack' or even a replacement for milk.these items while they are labeled as organic and as milk, are basically melted ice cream."
3,"Good as long as it's ""good""","My daughter loves to get these at Starbucks whenever we go to get me an overpriced coffee. I feel good about giving them to her because it's Organic, however, there have been more that a few times that she has gotten a rancid one that had not even yet past the expiration date! I know these don't have to be refrigerated... but maybe they should be? Anyway, these are great, but give em a sniff test before handing them over to your child."
5,"Great stuff, although kinda sweet","It's organic and milk - what's not to like? My 4-yr old switched from liking the chocolate product to the vanilla one, which I thought was good. However, I grabbed a sip the other day and found the vanilla version quite sweet. Since then, I'm now trying to use this after meals as a dessert option instead."
2,"Good Product, Terrible Price!","My five year old loves this milk and the fact that it is shelf stable means that I can pack it in his school snacks and not worry about it spoiling...very handy.BUT, Amazon's price is HORRIBLE. What a way to take advantage of people who might live in remote areas without a retail outlet. I buy this at BJ's for $12.79 for a case of 18 and can even get it at Whole Foods (you know, of the ""Whole Paycheck"" joke) for $14.99.They do have the strawberry milk here, which I've never seen at a retail store, but, fortunately, my son doesn't like it. I did buy it on ""sale"" for closer to the usual retail price."
2,A great product; a disappointing distribution channel,"My daughter has loved Horizon's organic milk boxes for several years, so I was excited to find them in cases through Amazon and ordered vanilla and chocolate. Both arrived promptly, yet I was greatly disappointed that the vanilla case had a Jan. 2011 expiration while the chocolate had one for June 2011. The vanilla had obviously been ""aging"" in a warehouse.I have these on a bi-monthly subscription service, so I'm hoping the next delivery in November has fresher vanilla product. And if not, I'll have to find a source elsewhere."
4,"Horizon Organic Reduced Fat Milk is a Favorite, but pricy on Amazon","My kids love this milk. Admit it is on the expensive side, but it travels well and the kids will drink it (they won't drink other milk.)Note: Just went to BJs wholesale and paid 12.99 for the 18 pk. Won't buy from Amazon again when there's such a price difference."
1,Used to love these little boxes....,"I buy these religiously for my kids lunches...until today. From now on I will not buy these ever again. For a quick dinner tonight I put in a pizza and pull out 2 milk boxes for my boys. My youngest takes a sip and shakes his head dramatically. I don't think too much of it (he just turned 2 yesterday), then 10 minutes later he takes another sip with the same reaction. I take a sip out of curiosity and race to the sink to spit out the sludge/liquid rancid milk before I vomit. Now I'm anxiously waiting to see if he gets sick. I used to work in quality control and I now have no faith in Horizon's quality assurance/control practices. Never will I buy this again!"
1,Not very healthy?,"My son loves these milks and we used to get them for him when we went to Starbucks. I was familiar with the Horizon brand and thought that the vanilla flavor would be fine. I began to notice a few times after drinking this he would say his tummy hurt or he would act sick(really tired) shortly after drinking them. I read the label and saw 29g of sugar...yeah holy cow!When we serve him a flavored milk I give him Gerbers smart sips, they have vanilla and mild vanilla flavor with 11g of sugar, I think the mild vanilla has even less grams of sugar. He still loves the taste too! I find them in the babyfood aisle at the grocery store."
2,This price is a rip off!,My daughter drinks 2-3 of these each day. I was buying this from Amazon prime until they racheted up the price. I used to pay $14 which was competitive with Costco. Now- it's just a COMPLETE RIP OFF!! I will buy it anywhere but Amazon now. Unreal that they are now charging $6 more for the same milk!! Go elsewhere- even Whole Foods has it cheaper!
2,Bouncin' off the walls!!,"Children who drink this product will most likely be bouncing off the walls after consumption. (My twins were running laps after drinking.)The vanilla flavored milk box is loaded with more sugar than any child, or human for that matter, needs. Stick with regular milk."
1,unhappy with amazon,i ordered this product from amazon in feb first week and have yet to get my shipment.
2,My kids didn't like it,I love the fact that it is easy to put in lunches and that it's Organic- but my kids did not like the vanilla flavor-
2,So-so at best--not the comprehensive source as advertised.,"I bought this book in prep for taking our family of 5 on the road full-time (a subject which this book doesn't cover at all--it is geared almost exclusively to retirees). I found many of the chapters vague and without solid content. In addition, it was not well edited (referred to the computer in their RV as a ""PCU"") and appears to be a self-published book done on the cheap. But the most aggravating part was the amount of space devoted to their newsletter (which they often printed verbatim at the end of each chapter). Not only were most of these stories irrelevant, they were not interesting for someone doing investigative research (as I was) into full-time RVing. Maybe OK for a retiree with lots of time to read the trying-to-be-pithy stories, but not for someone looking for a concise resource."
5,A must read for those planning to RV fulltime.,Almost 10 years of fulltime experience plus the ability to convey information about all its aspects combine to make this book a must read for those planning to RV fulltime or to better understand the lifestyle.
1,Just Doesn't Sound Right,"I like to listen to strings, but these songs weren't meant for that kind of instrumentation. I just don't think it sounds right. It sounds very incomplete like something's missing."
3,I have not tried the Green but the Purple could be sharper purple,THe Green I know will be unmistakably green but I was a little disappointed with the purple since it lacked in my view that exact sense of that P U R P L E one might expect. I like my purple to reveal a brilliant sense of the exotic color among colors.
4,Hnady little wire stripper/cutter,"This cutter/stripper is a well made little unit. It's not an all-in-one tool in the sense that it has a limited range of wire sizes it can accommodate, so check the sizes before you buy to ensure they match your needs. The cutter it very sharp and slices easily through copper wire. The little latch lock keeps the tool compact when not in use. The handles are a tad thin for my liking, and it probably the only downside for me, but I guess that's a personal thing! Overall, a solid unit that gets the job done!"
3,meh,"A bit smaller than I'd like....my hands kind of dwarf these....and i don't have humongous hands.I'd get the 8 or 8-1/2"" version if i needed another."
5,A great tool for the price,"After using a multi wire stripper tool for years that I got from a nationwide radio chain back when I was in high school (I'm almost 40 now), this tool is a complete god send! I'm not a professional or anything but do do my share of things like creating my own speaker wires to custom lengths and other home theater and stereo tasks around the house.This is so fun, more comfortable and easier to use than my prior one. The handle plastic is not sliding off like the old tool either. I threw the old one away and was happy to do so. after getting this."
3,Took forever to arrive,"These are nice basic strippers, but it took longer for this gift to arrive than any other present I ordered from Amazon."
2,"Does the job, but...","Although these work liked I'd expected, I had two concerns about them:1: I'm working with speaker wire labelled as 14AWG, but that setting on the stripper wound up cutting some wire off the inside. Moved to the larger 12AWG setting and was able to cut through with no problem; I can't be sure whether the issue is with this item, or with the speaker wire itself.2: The packaging for this item states ""WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer"" with no further information. I'll be, at minimum, washing my hands well after each use.These got my project done, but I'd have preferred something with more accurate gauge measurements and no warning that it's going to give me cancer."
3,The story drags,"This is the second story in this series that was like this: there is no communication between the main characters and the story drags out until it is almost painful. No... it was painful! I kept hoping that there was more to the story than regrets and sadness, but I ended up pretty disappointed. Especially at the end with the way the characters reacted to something very important that would affect the rest of their lives. I want to say more, but I don't want to give out spoilers... so I'll say I should have went with my gut and passed on this one. 2 1/2 stars"
3,DIFFERENT ITEM THAN PICTURED!!!,"BOUGHT THIS ON THE PICTURE BUT INSTEAD OF RECEIVING A LARGE PAIR OF NEEDLENOSE PLIERS LIKE PICTURED I RECEIVED A PAIR OF ""LINESMAN"" LOOKING PLIERS WITH A BENT LEG ON ONE SIDE FOR TWISTING WIRE. WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE MORE COMPARISON SHOPPING TO SEE THE ACTUAL PICTURE. PLEASE CHANGE THE PICTURE OF THE ITEM TO MATCH WHAT IS BEING SOLD."
5,The Aeolian Haydn rocks!,"I am so pleased to own this super collection of Haydn Quartets that covers material from early to late creativity of the composer. To me, the quartet sounds beautifully balanced and mellow, and I feel they definitely do justice to the intent of Haydn's work. My only regret is that they don't include Op.3 in this collection! (I wonder why not?) But, hey, the rest are great!"
4,Quick way to measure head space,This system will allow you to measure headspace as it promises. It is pretty quick and easy but I think a few changes would make it even better. There is only one screw to hold it to the caliper so it is never really centered. Then the shell has some play in the shell holder giving it enough play that you can only be accurate to +or- .002 or .003 when measuring. So you end up trying to hold it in place as you measure. a little cock off center and your reading is different. While it might be a pain I think a holder for each shell would afford a more stable system that would result in higher accuracy.
3,"Great sonics and orchestra, mature kids","This is an enjoyable recording, mainly for the good sound and the big-sized playing of the Vienna Philharmonic. Solti takes an expansive (yes, Wagnerian) view of the piece, and does not treat it like a children's opera. Neither do the singers. Lucia Popp makes no attempt to sound like a young girl, and Briggite Fassbainder sounds more like an Octavian than a Hansel. The witch is an artist I don't know. She does the role in the old crone manner. That's fine, but after hearing Christa Ludwig or Marijanna Lipvosek in the role, one realizes how much a mezzo in their prime can bring to this portrayal, rather than an aging soprano.I would rate this recording behind the (for me) first choice Tate on EMI, which has excellent sonics, a perfect cast, and a performance that sounds right in every way. I also think the RCA w/Moffo, Donath and Ludwig is superior although the sonics are a bit bright for such a glowing score."
3,Nothing what I was expecting,"The film was okay. I thought it was about a writer, writing a biography of W. E not having an obsession over the two lovers. It's was good, not great though."
2,Interesting by vyctorynotes.blogspot.com,I found this film to be interesting. It is not the best film I have ever seen but I enjoyed it somewhat. It seems to belong to the category of film art. I think it is worth seeing once.
4,Madonna hits one out of the park,"I didn't think I was going to enjoy W.E., but I did! Superb acting and Madonna does an insightful take on one of the most publicized love stories of the last century. If you enjoyed The King's Speech you might like this one as well.A most pleasant surprise, all in all."
3,parallel stories,"A contemporary young woman - obsessed with Wallis Simpson and her affair with David, son of King George V - moves through her own struggles in an unhappy marriage and thwarted dreams. The beginning was choppy and confusing, but the stories did work together, and the structure became easier to follow. Footage of the time is woven in as Wally studies momentos of the era. As she pulls her own life together, Wally wonders how Wallis felt about her life as Duchess of Windsor, after (David)Edward VIII's abdication to be with her."
3,Pretty to look at,"Visually Stunning. Though not terribly engrossing, the plot and storyline were pleasing. Interesting switch up to use Wallis's view. (Love the red lip). I would have been more forgiving if the story had exposed something new about Wallis & Edward, but over all, not a disappointment. I would own this on DVD just for the visual feast."
5,W.E. (awesome,It is an excellent movie that tells the story from her point of view - great work to tell a true story.
5,A wonderful love story!,"I really enjoyed this movie, two love stories in one film. If you want to watch a true love story, watch this movie! Loved it!"
1,Disappointing,"I have a strong interest in the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's story, which is why I rented this movie. Too little of W.E. (Wallis and Edward) and too much much of an American woman in a seemingly loveless and definitely abusive marriage. I stuck with it to the end but if I could have edited out the wife-in-bad-marriage half of the movie, it would have been much more interesting. I did like Madonna's thesis that King Edward was not the only one who make a huge sacrifice for this marriage. Wallis Warfield Simpson gave up her comfortable marriage to become the reviled wife of an exiled former king. Wallis and Edward's story is fascinating, but you would barely know it from this movie."
3,"Beautifully Filmed and Acted, but a Bit Empty","I enjoyed much about this movie, but wondered why on earth the decision was made to juxtapose a modern love story over the ""Story of the Century?"" I loved the scenes with Wallis and Edward, and resented the modern story as it took away from what was truly captivating. It was well-filmed, but left me feeling empty and wanting more of the Royals."
3,Great disappointment,"I was very excited to get this movie. What a disappointment, too much jumping from one time period to the other. It would have been greatto just tell the story about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not worth the time it takes to watch.,"The film was dull, boring, and basically not worth the time it takes to watch it all the way to the end."
1,Let the Truth Be Told,"Madonna should stick to the vapid pop culture milieu she is used to occupying, and stop turning history into gag me with a spoon fantasy.The truth about Edward VIII's Nazi links are based upon newly declassified FBI files. The playboy prince and his relationship with Wallace Simpson, the twice divorced American he married, was a convenient pretext for forcing him into abdicating when the real reason had been deep establishment suspicion of his pro-German views. The British establishment was extremely forgiving towards Edward and deeply sympathetic to fascism.Simpson had been the lover of German Ambassador von Ribbentrop, (who went on to become Hitler's foreign minister); and as Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, Edward was earmarked by Hitler as a potential puppet king after the Nazi victory.If there had been an option to chose zero stars, I would have gladly done so."
2,disappointing,"sure, the art is rough but i didn't mind. that's on purpose, and to good effect. what i did care about was how repetitive the story got after a while. for the first 80 or so pages it was a beautiful and engaging growth of the two characters' love. up until then i would've given this 5 stars, actually. but then i needed some drama. some development. the author kept hinting at it but then pulling back. *Eventually* we get some but it's so long into the story (and comes on so unexpectedly) that by then i was getting sick of the characters and didn't care. the author needs to work on his overarching narrative because Clumsy ends up as almost a bunch of little vignettes. the time structure was unclear as well. there were some flashbacks and returns to present but it was hard to follow. overall, a disappointment to a promising start."
1,Very over-rated: I'd give it zero stars if I could!,"I bought this book on the strength of it's reviews (from many places as well as Amazon.com), which all seem to be positive. I have to wonder if the other reviewers have read the same book? I just don't see it. This book is boring and trite, with pointless, flat dialog and no real narrative to speak of. The artwork is so terrible I can't stand to look at it. It's not even cute-bad, it's totally without any illustration talent at all. Many 4th graders could draw better. Maybe it's supposed to be ""quaint"", and ""honest"" but the overall effect of the art is to make the book look like garbage. Brown should take a clue from Harvey Pekar and get someone else to do his illustration. If you insist on reading this, borrow it, don't spend a cent on this poorly done piffle."
4,Channeellock 7.75 inch Diagonal Cutting Pliers,"These cut better than the Channellock Nippers which I have which are slightly larger. If you are trying to choose between the two, I would recommend these first, even though I think the Nippers are very good.I also agree with Brian C.'s comments about curved diagonal pliers viv-a-vis straight ones. Much better to buy the curved ones."
3,Good but not the best of the v-smile games,I thought this would be my son's fave since he loves bob. He rarely picks this one to play. He prefers Spiderman and Friends and the one the one that came with the system. Bob just isn't that much fun. As all the games the age ranges are off by a mile. They are asking 4 yr olds to do skills that a kids wouldn't learn till 1st grade. Of course he can guess and finally get them right and move on the moving part that he prefers. Even if your kid is a fan of Bob I'd suggest a different game.
4,good educational game,"My son just received this for his birthday and loves it. He plays it and is learning about colors, patterns, and lots of other good things that preschoolers need to know and review. A definite must for a Bob fan or a boy who is into tools."
3,Unhappy,I received my Dvds I knew it was used but its missing a disc if I would have known I wouldn't have bought used
5,addictive and compelling,"The walker clan are insane and yet cohesive and each and every one of them would lay down their very lives for any and all of the others (even surrogates). I'm not a homophobe, (even though I was raised/'trained' to be one) I have my reservations and try my utmost to keep them from being openly offensive to others, which is the target of each and every Christian to ""Love thy neighbor as thyself"". Amen"
4,brothers and sisters,I love Brothers and Sisters. I missed a few of the episodes of the first season and the First Season DVD's allowed me to get to know the characters and provided the missing information about the characters and the Walker family.
3,Not-sci-fiction sitcom,"A tale of the wealthy US family of the dawn of a third millennium, this TV sitcom inevitably triggers juxtaposition with a classic ""The Forsyte Saga"" equipped with contemporary trends of anti-terrorist activities and same gender affairs.However, it's too long, too detailed on very private/any boring moments and lucking of depth as a mere personal monetary gain rules all characters regardless their places in a family narrowed mostly during this season, alike all low budget dramas, with walls of own castles and properties, near no landscape action in the public spaces depicted.Too extended, too unnatural, too distant from majority of commoners experiences in the USA.Lengths of segments, 50-58min are OK."
3,Reasonable Delivery Time,I love this show! so much that I bought all 3 seasons to watch before this weekes premeire! I even got them a few days before my ETA. I will however say that I was NOT pleased on how damaged the 1st season box was.
2,OMG ARE YOU PEOPLE BRAIN DEAD ? LOL,"Ok let's be honest, I don't know WHAT kind of Tv the other reviewers are used to watching, but they are crazy. This show is the CORNIEST show I have seen in a LONG time. The dialogue is average but the scenarios are so lame and predictable. I love Sally Field but her character is ridiculously annoying. I had high hopes for this show since people go on and on and on about how great it is, wrong !There were times at ""dramatic"" moments in the plot that I actually laughed uncontrollably b/c the scenes were so over dramatic and overacted. God love sexy Balthazar Getty, but a good actor he is not. lol The reviewer who compared this show to ""Six feet under"" is on crack. That show actually had interesting plots and twists and was excellent.God knows why this show is still on the air, but then again Bush got re-elected so we know the C- average citizen is still alive and well. LOLSkip this one and thank me later !"
5,Brothers & Sisters,"I have watched Borthers & Sisters since it first started, I was hooked early. I recently had purchased Season 2 and of course I needed Season One. This season was a great intoduction to the Walker family. You get a good look into the lives of each of the Walker children, as well as the matriarch Nora. We get to see how a family works through their own lives and all of that drama. We also get to see how they as a family work through sins of the father and the family business. I don't have one favorite eposide from this season, as they are all exceptionally well done. I did enjoy the extra episode that wasn't aired that shows the funeral and its inital aftermath. Wether you have been a fan since the begining or a new fan, this is a must have for your DVD collection."
4,Addictive viewing,"I enjoy Brothers and Sisters so much I have to ration how many episodes I'm allowed to watch in any given sitting. There is something very compelling and very real about the way the relationships are portrayed in the Brothers and Sisters series. The acting is exceptional and it's wonderful to see the interplay between the different generations of the family. The dialogue is witty, clever, often hilarious and sometimes really sad. The writers take time to develop storylines through the season which keeps you coming back for more."
4,Brothers and Sisters..,"Its a good show, I had never seen the first season, so it was pretty good a little different than I expected based on seeing the second season but it was good :) Highly Recommended"
4,brothers and sisters,a great serie that I wanted to share with my mother. It arrived at the scheduled time and she very much enjoyed it.
3,DECENT CONTENTS--AWFUL PACKAGING,"The content of this book was interesting and well sourced if a little bit repetitive and heavy-handed. However, the printed text was riddled with numerous typos--sometimes as many as 2 or 3 per page! I can only assume that this is the fault of the publisher and not the author. Don't read this book if typos drive you crazy!Author: 4 starsPublisher: 1 star"
4,"Good book, needs a proofreader","I found this an interesting and well researched book. However, it had numerous proofreading errors that were very distracting."
1,Complete Nonsense,"This book is complete nonsense. Perhaps instead of looking at Tim LaHaye as a villain and thinking he wants people in the Middle East dead, it might be better to look at the author's agenda which is to label people who believe in Christ as ""war mongers."" Clearly the author doesn't understand Christianity at its core or the teachings of Jesus.Perhaps the author should have taken the time to read the Book of Daniel and The Book of Revelation to have a better view of end-time beliefs.The wonderful thing is that the God we believe in absolutely believes in the freedom to choose. You can choose to believe or not. However, our ability to believe or not doesn't change truth."
1,Pan Warped,The pan worked fine until it warped on the bottom and would not stay flat on the stove. I sent it back for a refund.
4,Perfect for stur fries!,"I love this deep pan!! It is perfect for sauces, stir fries and even stews! One thing though... when I was cooking some sauce, a bit got over the side and when I went to wipe it with my wet cotton towel, the towel stuck to it. And it happens with all my towels, and I have a huge variety, so that's very unusual. I learned that the paint on the pan is not good quality so you have to wait for the pan to cool off before trying to wash any stains and spills off of it."
5,best skillet I ever had,"i redecorated my kitchen in copper and red. i love this skillet, no need for oil or butter, good even heat, and beautiful to beat. i got sick of ugly pots and pans, tried this one, and cooking is a dream and much healtier now. i would highly recommend all of the red enamel faberware cookware to anyone, and now my friends are all jealous of them. just for decor, i leave one on top of the stove. it looks great !!"
5,Great pan,I've had the pan about a month now and used it about 4 times so far. The non stick coating is excellent. Something got burned into the bottom of the pan & it came off no problem. Another great feature is the light weight. I have really bad wrists and am not able to handle heavy items very well this pan is great for this. All in all great product
4,Book arrived in very good condition,"I'm reviewing this after some time, so I don't recall if I purchased this book ""new"" or ""used"", however, sometimes the used books are in better condition than the new. This book arrived in good condition and in a timely manner."
2,great info - terrible editing,"This book came so highly recommended it seemed like a sure thing. And in fact, it has a wealth of info on use cases; I can certainly see it being a valuable reference for someone who is already an expert with use cases. For those with no previous exposure, however, it is a tiresome morass to wade through; so cluttered and muddled that finding the underlying meaning becomes a real challenge. This book could have been edited to 2/3rds the size, and been a far better book because of it. Was the editing staff on vacation?"
1,NOT WELL RESEARCHED NOR COMPASSIONATE,"This book is NOT a very compassionate guide to choosing a nursing home for your loved one. The book does not recognize that parent care is an emotional roller coaster for both parties. I did not find this book thoroughly researched nor did it tackle all the tough subjects, such as coping with dementia, working with a hospice, navigating within a hospital, etc. There are better quality books on the market that deal with this issue and many more issues regarding elder care."
1,USELESS,I did not find anything useful in this book. It is very out-dated and not very compassionate regarding elder-care in America. There has been many books written regarding identifying quality care in nursing homes in the last 2 years - I would start there. Good Luck!
4,Convient,This is very handing. Wish it was the full cord and not just an attachment to the other portion. Easy to travel with.
1,ZIP-LINQ retractable notebook power cord kit,"This product did not fit my notebook so it is useless to me. The product description did not say that it only fits certain notebooks. Now that it is opened, I cannot return it."
4,Better than the original,"The price for this power cord is a little high - but it is a nice addition to my travel bag. I ""upgraded"" from a large 15.4"" notebook to aSamsung N120-12GBK 10.1-Inch Black Netbook - 6 Cell Batteryrecently. I was tired of lugging around a big backpack just to have my laptop handy. The Samsung is so much lighter and fits in a bag that goes under the seat in front of me on an airplane.Unfortunately, the Samsung comes with a power supply that's almost as big as my old one. And the power cord from the wall to the power supply is surprisingly large. I got this as a replacement. It saves much space inside my smaller laptop bag. I also replaced the power supply - but that's a different story:Replacement AC Adapter/Charger 19V 2.1A 40W for Samsung N110-12PBK,N120-12GBK NetbookOverall, it's great replacement cord that keeps itself tidy. But you'd be better off with a plain, thinner cord with a velcro strap. The plastic spool on this cord is rather bulky."
3,Caution: European Model,"This is the European model of the familiar Ziplinq in that rather than having a U.S. plug it has a European plug with a U.S. adapter. Fine, if you're a world traveler. Just one more part to lose if all your travel is in the U.S. Unfortunately (and suspiciously) this spec was not disclosed in the listing. It works, but it is not what I wanted nor was it as described."
1,"If I could of rated it no stars, I would of done it","Bought several of these, and the first one broke on its initial use. The second one did not last much longer. Great idea but terrible implementation. Flimsy and lacks durability. Don't waste your money"
2,Weak power cord - damaged after little use.,"I loved this at first, but soon became hazard. As others have stated, my power cord also developed exposed wires with occasional use. The notebook side of this power cord is very weak. I tried to extend it's life with electrical taping it up, but eventually that even failed with a spark and a trip of the circuit breaker. It was great while it lasted. Back to the OEM cord."
1,"Horrible quality, stops working within several months","Went through about 6 of these in the last couple of years, two of them replaced on warranty. The quality is just terrible, either the laptop or outlet side cables break and you have to wiggle them so they connect again (great idea, especially if you're on a plane, so it'll start sparking and smoking). Just threw out my last one, not buying them anymore, not worth the trouble. Great idea, convenience is there, but the quality of execution is below par."
2,Works well...until it fails,"Bought this unit about a 10 months ago. I stowed it in my bag attached to my laptop's power brick. Unwittingly, over time, as it jostled around in my bag, that caused the edge of the spool casing to rub against part of the cord (right at the base of the plug) and it severed one of the wires, rendering it useless. It worked really well before this, but I would have hoped it'd be a bit less prone to damaging itself (such as by the wire guides having rounded corners instead of sharp(ish) ones). I'll buy another one, but only because it's so cheap and I haven't found a substitute that looks markedly better. So, 3 stars...not bad, but not great.Update: Bought a second one...same exact failure within 1 year, and I haven't really even used it very much. Changing my rating to 2 stars since these should be advertised as ""disposable"" cords."
5,Ziplink Retractable Notebook Power Cord,"This is an excellent item for those who travel with their notebook or if you just want to reduce clutter. Stores well in a laptop bag. No problems using this cord outside of the United States with 220v power, however a plug/outlet adapter will needed."
2,Just a fluke?,"I bought two of these and one worked for about a week, then surprisingly jammed up. It wouldn't come out of the spool. I must have pulled too hard because the whole thing exploded, with the two plastic halves of the spool and the coiled up spring flying across the room. A bit funny and embarrasing in front of a customer... The second one has worked fine."
2,Worked great-- for a while,"After using this for about five weeks, it suddenly failed-- as in, it retracts fine but no longer conducts electricity.Annoyingly, it died just two days after the return window expired.I'll try another one-- it's very convenient and the price is right."
2,Retractable?,"After a few weeks of use, it got jammed. There is no way to open to spool without breaking it, so I pulled the wire. Then it popped open and the springs popped out. I have since used it as a regular power cable. I wouldn't recommend this product at all unless it is the most inexpensive notebook power cable since the only good thing about it is that the cable itself is durable and has adequate length (not too short, not too long)."
4,Good for lesser tangle but not very compact; lacks earth wiring.,"The main reason for this product was to minimize the tangles. The product does that well even though the amount of space taken up by the reel mechanism is significant. However, I am concerned that the three prong male adapter simply connects to the standard cord's two-prong connector, leaving the earth unconnected on the PC's side. That defeats the PC designer's intent in having an earth for the power adapter; Zip-Linq should have used a three-wire cord in order to comply with the OEM design."
3,Kola Nut Movie,The indepent creative abilities of the cast and company make for an sightful look and the Cameroonian culture. The sound quality needs improvement with a little more explanation for rapid transitions from Germany to marriage. I hope they make a sequel and provide resources for the viewer to understand the kola nut Gods.
3,The previous review is a little misleading,"First of all, the recording accurately captures the acoustical environment in the Great Hall of the Concertgebouw. Andrew Cornall is presently one of Decca's finest producers and his studio recordings have never been as bad as the best Karajan got with DG in his digital years. Anyone who has seen a score of any version of Bruckner 9 knows that there is no Bass drum part. In fact, there is no Bass drum part in any of Bruckner's symphonies. Chailly deserves more credit for this recording. True, his performance does not eclipse Jochum, Walter, or possibly even Blomstedt on the same label, but he is the youngest of these conductors. The brass is not as dominant as the Karajan or Solti versions, but the acoustic counteracts the lack of darkness in the brass section. It is typical that people think there is only one approach to Bruckner. I think the Concertgebouw setting is very appropriate for this music and Chailly deserves more recognition."
1,Buy only if you want one more possession of Bruckner#9,"Chailly never convinces from the beginning that this will be a good recording. Orchestra seems placed too far out, recording engineers need to hear Jochum's version hundred times before next such recording of monumental and serious symphony. This could be very well be called Brass symphony, but Chailly gives drained down version. On plus side the Concertgebouw strings are good. What is lacking after all with Chailly is that the tonal movement coming at you and then dissipating away is not well balanced. For that Guilini and Jochum captures the essence. For the first movement is misterioso, no mysterious sound emanates from Chailly-led Concertgebouw. Bass drum and tympani rolls are rare to hear, which you can promonently hear in Guilini, Jochum or Barenboims. Technical score 1 Performance 1 Overall 1 (all out of 5)."
4,Great compilation CD of 7 string guitar virtuosos,"This compilation is built around a single instrument as the common ground. In this case all of the various musicians/bands utilize 7 string electric guitars, mostly in the metal style, but with artists stretching significantly beyond that genre alone. From shred metal to hip hop/urban and spacious proggressive flavored tracks, this CD is real feast for heavy guitar afficianados."
3,"Attractive, but a tad unstable, with a fake buckle!","I think these are nice looking, especially from the side view. But, note that I ordered half a size larger than usual and it still seems small...I tried adjusting the buckle...turns out the buckle is fake! It's just a fake strap attached to the solid leather.The heel narrows a lot, so the actual heel point is not even as big as a quarter, or as the last segment of your thumb! So, when you put them on, there is some wobbling.I think most people buy Rockports for comfort...realize this may not be their most comfortable model.I got mine on sale, and I think they are worth keeping. The brown color looks like it does online."
2,Amazon sent my gift receipient worn shoes! I am highly disappointed.,"I sent my sister the shoes, who received them on time, liked the style, but got grossed out because the shoes had been worn by someone else before they got to my sister supposely in ""new"" condition. There are toe marks on the inside tips of the shoes and the soles have definitely been on the ground! My sister thinks that someone had either worn them around before putting them in the shoe box for shipment, or that someone else bought and returned the shoes in the above condition, but Amazon sent the dirty/worn returned item to my sister regardless, probably because I the buyer will not get to see the item purchased.My sister now has to get her gift returned to Amazon for a replacement and get ripped by shipping charges, which is absolutely unacceptable!Highly disappointed and embarassed!"
3,"Good, but not as much expected.","The book is good for young minds who are seeking direction.It gives some insight about the complexity involved in building a true nation.The bad part is the editing, sentences gets repeated.some of the paragraphs are copied same mutiple times in a chapter, it feels like the rhetoric political speech."
5,"Data-Based, Analytical Assessment of Affirmative Action","Mr. Sowell takes an analytical, data-based approach to the assessment of affirmative action and avoids getting caught up in the obtuse, political rhetoric that too often defines the debate. He also details problems with other well known data-based studies on the topic, illuding to the purposeful skewing of the analysis. The book offers a comprehensive analysis of affirmative action across several countries with long track records. Mr. Sowell concludes by drawing a clear picture of the predominant failures of affirmative action across the globe and over time.The book is filled with untapped data and new ways of looking at this topic. As the author notes, many of the question he seeks to answer with regard to the promised benefits of affirmative action are considered taboo in today's ultra-politically correct society."
4,quite a brilliant series!,"This is a very fine example of emblematic symbology, as can be applied to ANY system of esoteric/Rosicrucian systems of investigation, limited only by your imagination"
1,Too bad -5 Stars is not available,"Worst purchase ever. Bought 200. Experiencing a 50% failure or higher rate. Bags look great going into the freezer. Then, check the next day, more than half have are soft and full of air. Will never buy these again. With shipping, my 200 cost $0.30 each. Just went to FoodSaver web site and bought 12 packs of 22 for $0.40 each. Had to order over 5 to get 30% discount and needed 12 to get over $100 to get free shipping to get the cost down. Believe me, the extra $0.10 per bag will be worth it, assuming the bags are as good as the FoodSaver unit samples. No problem using these. Will be buying the FoodSaver 5-ply bag and will NEVER buy these bags agsin. Horrible product. Reviewer who gave them 5 stars either needs to check how many have failed, or works for Tilia. No way, absolutely no way could these bags be considered 5-star."
3,"Good seller, mediocre product.","I was vrey pleased with this seller, but this product might need to be removed from their inventory. I have used 24 of the bags and only four held the vacuum. None of the food I sealed was sharp or rough; mostly dried apples and brown sugar, some lentils. At first, they were perfect, I checked for sharp edges and there were none. By morning, 21 of the 24 were full of air. If I stopped just shy of a complete vacuum and put the item (chicken meat, no bones) in the freezer, they didn't lose as much air. I am going to stick with the name brande from now on."
3,Food Saver Bags,"Great price on these bags however I find I sometimes must seal a double seal on them, to keep the vacumn intact."
1,Watch what you buy,"I bought this book for a young man in the facility I work in. I didn't research the book before purchasing. That was my fault. I love books, and think that books always add something. Was I wrong. This book is horrible. The language was terrible. I never throw books away, but that is exactly what I did with this one. I will admitt that I did not read the book. Flipping through and scanning was more than enough to figure out that it was a waste of money (both in purchasing and in publishing)."
3,This book was not as good as I expected it to be.,"This book was just O.K. It wasnt all that great. I couldnt relate to some of the ""countryfied"" wording. I guess that comes with the territory of me being a reader fromt the West Coast. The so called ballers just seemed booty..."
1,Terrible!,This horchata mix tastes nothing like horchata. There are better alternatives if you want horchata.
4,4.5.............Interracial novel,"I read this book in one day. I picked it up and put everything else down. It was really worth reading. This novel bt. a woman of Creole heritage named Vashti and and white man named Mark was a good romance that spanded over four yrs. I like the fact that even though they were of different cultures, no one made a big deal out it. The important part was about the progress of their relationship. Both character were not perfect and both played a role in how their relationship was going along with destiny. The secondary characters added to the book. This was a good quick read. Love scenes good. Begnning of novel will hook you."
3,Reading it now...,"and not enjoying it. It's just not very engaging. Truthfully, I am not sure I'll even finish it.Also, the type font is that of a typewriter. For whatever reason, this is very distracting for me."
5,The Giant and the Beanstalk,Clever. This new twist on Jack and the Beanstalk gives children the other point of view. Was the giant really mean and nasty? This book keeps the reader on his toes by painting the familar fairytale in another light. I like how the giant had to go through five other Jack characters to find the one who climbed the beanstalk. This would be a great book to share in a classroom who is already familar with the traditional story and nursery rhymes involving the Jack characters. This could create a great conversation.
1,Very bad quality,This was almost impossible to assemble I needed tools I did have Even though it looks good in the photo. Do not buy.
1,Save your money and your time - skip this one!,"I must have missed something with this book - most likely a plausible plot.Agent Kelly John Beach is a covert operative assigned to retrieve some diamonds and prove that a diamond broker is really a front for a consortium of bad guys, Spectra IT (apparently kind of like KAOS from Get Smart).When he neglects to notice a hidden camera, he knows he is caught, and suddenly needs an alibi. Enter secretary Emma Webster, who has had a secret crush on him since day one. She agrees to be his alibi, and when they hook up for their date, they have sex then profess their love for each other for the next 80 pages.Of course, the story is just over 100, so it leaves little time for a plot, until Emma is grabbed by the bad guys, and Kelly John has to rush in to save her. Yes, there is a lot of hot sensual scenes, but there is little to redeem this trite storyline."
1,Too driven and with a weak cast,Solti's conducting here is far too driven and self-conscious. He misses entirely the nobility of Beethoven's score.Hofmann and Behrens fail to do justice to Florestan and Leonora as both are well below their best.
3,What happened to the REAL Buck 65?,"I was very disappointed by this album. I gave three stars because some of the music is decent, and the concept as well. What I need to ask when I listen to this is, why does Buck 65 now insist upon using this phony/pretentious, hoarse smoker's voice on all of the songs? With albums like Vertex, Man Overboard, and even Square Buck 65's voice is very dynamic and dances around the beats.If you are a fan from the old days then don't waste your money."
2,Won't cut steel cables (bikers beware),"I bought these with the sole purpose of cutting brake lines and cable housings for my bike. Once they arrived I noticed that in small print along the blades it says ""Not for steel use"", making them effectively worthless to me. Really wish Amazon would have mentioned that in their listing. I would not have purchased them if I had known that.Edit: looks like the Amazon description has been updated since I purchased them. Good work, Amazon!"
4,Great product,"Have bought these before and they are a great tool for cutting cable, price here in Australia is au$65 - $80, so a great price.Cheers"
3,Nice cable cutter,"This will only cut Copper, or Aluminum. No steel, nothing ferrous, either. Soft metals only. Just a warning before you buy."
2,Title is deceptive..l,Title is deceptive. States that it is plural to deceive you since they usually come in 6-packs but I only received 1 even though it says PLUGS.
4,"Russian Tribute To Depeche Mode, Volume 1","A great tribute album just as the Greek tribute. Strictly, for the serious Depeche Mode followers only! Some great tracks and very creative by the Russians, such as 'Home' 'Little 15' 'somebody' and 'The things you Said'. 'Enjoy the Silence' in Russian - umm...why? and 'Black Celebration' sure Bob Marley would have liked this track!"
5,"Addictive, tongue-in-cheek sitcom","Great writing, hilarious characters, and ensemble acting. Why only seven seasons? I want more!My husband brought the first one home from the library and we were hooked."
5,corner gas #1 & delivery,I was very satisfied with this video as it was a gift for a hard to shop for person. The service was also very good.
4,Corner Gas Season 1,I was very happy with my purchase of corner gas. The product arrived quicker than I expected & was in good shape. I was very pleased with the sellers promptness.
4,Unique Canadian Humour,"While the setting is purely small-town Canada, the humour is universal. Episode 6 has to be my favourite, with all the double-meanings and play on words. Brent Butt is hilarious in a subdued way and the rest of the cast are brilliant. They really work well together. It's nice to watch something genuinely funny that doesn't insult one's intelligence and doesn't have to resort to toilet-humour to get laughs. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good laugh and wanting some insight into refreshing Canadian humour that all can relate to."
2,SO not Mayberry . . .,"Some reviewer compared this show to ""Mayberry"" . .. what an insult! This show is SO unfunny . . more like junior high 'humor'. Oh how funny - Dad takes a rented VHS player home (of course, having no idea how to hook it up) and - wait for it - they show the machine mangled beyond compare. Another Amazon reviewer thought it hilarious that the townsfolk were going to acquire a giant Hoe (a farming community) and, te-he, people think it's the other kind of 'hoe' (oh come on - really?). It goes on and on . . . NONE it remotely even a little funny. I ordered both seasons of this show from the library based on the reviews here - I couldn't finish even one episode. I'll give credit due that it is a clean show - but that's about it."
2,Amateur Television,"I'm sorry folks, the production quality and content of this show is just not up to American standards. I have to agree with the earlier reviewer about the ""amateur with a video camera quality"" of this show.There is the annoying ""zoom"" sound used between each scene. Right off of Nickleodean kids' shows. I'm sorry, that is amateur hour.It is one of the best made Canadian shows though."
5,Thee best String Quartet CD,"This is thee best Strings Quartet they have released. I have about 50 of their CDs and this one is the best. They add some woodwinds wonderfully and they add one of their own songs, Transglobal Express, which is one of my top 10 favorite songs of all time. So beautiful. So yeah, if you *love* Dido, I 1,000% guarantee you you will love this CD. Amazingly engineered, the clarity is beautiful, and on extensive hifi systems, this CD will inspire tears of amazement and beauty."
5,Most Complete Introduction to Hinduism,"I was impressed with the depth, breath and the easy reading format of this book. The book both introduces the basics of Hindu Philosophy and then goes into detail about various aspects of Hinduism. Its simply written so even someone with no familiarity with hinduism can learn. At the same time covers enough material and concepts in sufficient depth to be usefull to practicing Hindus who want to broaden their own understanding of hindu philosophy or keep as a reference."
5,The Complete Idiot's Guide(R) to Hinduism by Linda Johnsen,"This book is the best introduction to Hinduism that I have seen for anyone from East or West. The style is very engaging, the information is accurate and the author has succeeded in connecting the spiritual truths to the modern life in such a way that it does not appear abstract anymore."
4,An easy to understand source of information!,"Great for a superficial overview of one of the world's oldest religions. Some topics should have been covered more in depth (i.e.: Puja, rituals, ceremonies, celebrations) but the content and history is great. The author's writing style is fun and easy to get into......I would recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring the Hindu path.....old timers and new timers alike."
5,Idiots Guide,"I haven't finished the book yet, but so far it has really broken things apart. It starts on the history of Hinduism which is very important."
2,Not great,"A very broad survey of a very complex religion.Note: David Frawley's participation actually harms this effort. Frawley is a very poor scholar. Instead, read the work of Michael Witzel."
4,An over looked writer,"The second in what hope is a series , by a writer that I think is under rated. The plot and setting are all standard stuff, but the way Swann uses them are the mark of a pro, you will want to read all his stuff."
4,Practical Handbook for Outlook Support,"I'm very impressed with this book. It is well-written, with good examples and clear graphics. I purchased it for help creating custom Outlook forms. The chapters on form design answered all my questions. I had looked in vain on the web for instructions that were basic enough for a non-programmer to follow yet included samples of code and formulas. I found that in this book. It is a practical and useful volume for anyone who is called on to support or administer Outlook."
2,New User. Advanced Needs. Little Help.,"I am a new user to Outlook 2000. I am an advanced ACT! user. My new job requires that I use Outlook 2000. After reviewing many books online I bought the Outlook 2000 Bible. WHAT A COMPLETE LET DOWN AND WASTE OF MONEY. I can't return it because in my initial enthusiasm I highlighted in the book. The ""Customizing Outlook 2000"" Chapter 16 section is terrible. Nothing advanced at all. Finally, the attached CD is a bust. My advise... KEEP LOOKING!"
5,A great addition to any Plunge Router,"This is a great accessory for plunge routers. It works perfectly in conjuction with a Woodrat machine, but it is also great for router tables and stand alone plunge routing. I was able to very quickly and easily install it onto my Dewalt 625 and it has worked flawlessly ever since. Put a touch of synthetic grease on the two points where the lower bar and upper bar touch and the action will be friction free and easy to control. A superb item and another wonderful innovation from a great company."
2,Not crazy about the quality of this item,"Sure it is cheaper than the original Ford replacement part, but the quality is typical Made in China marginal. The cap portion doesn't clip securely to the main body. Flashing lines are rough and not well finished. Better than nothing, but only just."
5,How Long,"Well after seeing how long it took the wise people to get season 2 out after Amazon had a listing for it but no date, let us all hope they are MUCH faster this time. This is a great show, simple jokes that can make anyone laugh."
2,Not one of the best.,I believe the later shows were the better shows. This was still a progress in action at this point. Try one more.
5,"Great, comedic court action.",This CD is a gift and will not be played until Dec 25th at the earliest with what I'm sure will yield positive results.
2,Great. But what about the other seasons?,"I absolutely love this show. However, Warner Brothers is releasing these DVDs about 1 every four or so years. I had gotten seasons one and two, and found the show to be funnier now than when I was a kid. Probably because I understand the jokes now. I just feel that it is a complete waste of money to buy anymore seasons if Warner Brothers isn't even sure they will release the rest of them."
2,Who is the judge in this photo,I really just wanna know who the judge is in the photos for the packaging. That is NOT Harry Anderson. It reminds me of the guy who was the judge trying to get Dan arrested for bribery.
2,disk check,"As a fan of Night Court, this 3rd season set was OK but not great. There are definitely good episodes but nothing worth the asking price here.My set had several episodes that were not viewable since the audio and video tracks didn't match. In particular, the one with Mel Torme suffered from this defect, so if you plan on buying be sure to keep the packaging and check out every episode before becoming attached to your purchase."
1,not what the photo showed,when I received it was NOT tunnel loop for the belt. Also the 2 screwdriver holders were to small. I like to put my strippers and razor knife there. I gave it away.
3,"Love the seller, product ok","The seller is great, great packaging, used goods as described, but my excellent stereo would sound better with a more recent recording on more modern recording equipment to make this piece of music really shine. I like the recording as much as any of the other Carmina Burana's but none have the recent clarity of recording that i am fussy about.Zziggy's Gal was the seller, it came very quickly and the packaging was a great pro job, with a classy nice note from the seller including an assurance that they guarantee satisfaction. Glad i bought it used, not much of a financial risk."
2,not so bad (musically)...,"... but unbearable for any Romance language speaker! The main fault of this edition is, in fact, the performers' pronunciation of latin lyrics which is awful to listen to. Try Deutsche Grammophon instead."
2,Does not contain Western USA trees,"I agree with most of the other user comments already posted (ugly book - but handy identifiation process) BUT I must point out something that no on else has said:THIS BOOK ONLY INCLUDES TREES found in the EASTERN USA.For those of us that live in the western USA, this book fails miserably."
4,A complete illustrative guide that is a handy reference.,"If you're ""stumped"" (get it?) to identify a tree - this is the book you need. Although illustrated with black and white photos, the book is a picture-perfect guide. Leaves, bark, seed, fruits all are categorized. Text is somewhat minimal. (I would have enjoyed knowing the history behind the naming of certain trees and other trivia). This is the books only deficiency. It is a ""must have"" however for the nature enthusiast."
5,a must have!,"Symonds' Tree Identification Book and his Shrub Identification Book are two fantastic guides. They have load of pictures - even from different stages/ages of the plant/tree so you can more easily make the id. The book is segmented into sections like leaves, bark, flowers, etc so that whatever part of the plant you have you can look it up that way. Or, if you have anidea what it might be you can go to the master pages in the back and see the whole assortment of photos pertaining to that species in one place. Its a fantastic reference that has really taken away a lot ofthe frustration and guesswork for me."
3,J. H. Haddock,"While this could be a great manual for the identification of northeastern trees, the discription would do well to mention that no trees west of North Dakota are included. Since I live in Arizona, I doubt I'll use it much. Wanna buy a copy?"
3,It is an ok book to ID trees.,I bought it because it was the only one on the shelf. Like I said it is ok but there are no real specs on the trees. At least the author could have put a little paragraph on all the genus. I will admit it is a good suppliment though b/c he is a twig master.
3,Detailed Tree ID,All black & white WITH detailed descriptions.Could use color and clearer illustrations.
2,Not first choice,"Taking this book in hand I am inclined to see the negative first. The black and white photographs look rather depressing, in particular those of the bark don't look very useful. This is not a book which looks good on the bookshelf! Also its size and soft cover make it somewhat unhandy for carrying it about: it is far from field guide size.As a tree book I very much prefer John Laird Farrar's ""Trees in Canada"" / ""Trees of the Northern United States and Canada"" which is a handy size, is handsomely bound, has excellent color photographs of trunks, flowers and fruits and stunning line drawings of habit, leafs, leaf scars and flower details, not to mention distribution maps.Of course the two books have only a limited overlap in area treated and in species selection and the book by Symonds certainly has the subjects for the photographs carefully chosen. Perhaps I will yet come to apppreciate it?"
3,Decent book for starters,"Mixed review. For identification of wholly unknown trees it can narrow searches down quickly and give an idea of the family of trees. For a beginner this is an excellent book. However for more experienced tree identifiers, this book is entirely unhelpful for identifying the differences between, for instance, scarlet oak, southern red oak, northern red oak, shumard oak, georgia oak, bear oak, turkey oak, cherrybark oak, pin oak, northern red oak, and black oak. This book would only provide four oaks to choose from in the above list and not give as detailed of a handling of those trees. For a much more detailed handling of tree identification in the Southeast I would recommend Native Trees of the Southeast by Kirkman, Brown and Leopold."
1,Poor is a Generous Rating,"I have been to Portugal many times and know quite a bit about the country's culture, it's people and history. I have to say that I must agree with most of the criticism that previous reviewers have written.It is hard to believe that Birmingham, despite his vast experience with Portugal and things Portuguese, could have produced such a mediocre book. Parts of it are almost fictional. Too much of the information Birmingham presents is just plain wrong, particularly regarding Portugal's colonial empire in Africa. After reading this I got the distinct feeling that Birmingham has no real depth of knowledge about the Portuguese people, let alone the history of Portugal."
2,A distorted picture of the country and its history,"In my view, this history of Portugal gives a distorted image of the country. It stresses the country's problems and plays down its achievements. The book pictures Portugal as a country struggling to establish a place on the world scene; modernise its economy and society; and secure political stability (!). In contrast, one can not find much on Portugal's gold age of the voyages of discovery and a worldwide maritime empire in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In fact there is not much on the first centuries of Portugal as a country. The whole book is rather biased, giving a one-sided and not particularly flattering picture of Portugal. I much prefer the more objective and well-balanced approach of 'Portugal: A Companion History, by Jose Hermano Saraiva et al."
1,A very deficient work.,I have read many general and specialized historical pieces on Portugal. This book is by far the worse I have run across.Cambridge University Press should be ashamed of publishing something as mediocre as this.
1,"Horrible, Useless Book","If you are interested in the history of Portugal, this is one book you should NOT buy. I have read numerous books about Portugal's history, and have studied it as well. I don't know where the author of this book got his information from. It's totally inaccurate, with his opinions or observations stated as fact. What was he thinking? If I could give it less than one star, I would. It deserves nothing. Simply horrible, inaccurate, useless..."
2,"A reasonably good basic history, but lacking in some areas.","Cunningham is a an exceptional scholar, and he has made a name for himself in African studies. His book on Portugal, however, is lacking. Some portions are not fully based on verifiable fact. Several of his opinions are quite streched, and he is anthropologically incorrect when he refers to the Portuguese as a race. The Portuguese are not a race. They are a PEOPLE within the caucasian race."
2,"Not 'concise', biased","Anything positive about the history of Portugal is given a low profile or has chunks missing or is missed altogether. Anything less glorious is given ample development, with debatable historical accuracy. The 'golden age' apparently didn't merit a chapter of its own, had to be put together with the Lisbon earthquake, which occurred later, and dwell mainly on slavery and religious oppression. This is an example of what another reviewer has pointed out as a 'distorted' image of the country and its people."
3,Review on microsystem design,"The book tries to cover many different topics at the same time and sometimes makes a quite messy work. However, the book has very good chapters and not so good ones. It provides a good introduction on MEMS fabrication, but a more interested reader will find difficult to fabricate MEMS with the given information. Chapters 5,6,7 and 8 are excellent, but chapters 9, 10,11 and 12 are incomplete and not easily understandable for a Electrical Engineer graduate student. Chapter 13 begins with general equations to be simplified considerably later, giving the impression to the reader that he has learned only a little about fluids. Chapter 11 is quite confusing and chapter 12 lack examples in 2D and 3D lumped models."
4,MEMS handbook for sure,I am a beginner on MEMS technology. I found this book useful when I borrowed it from lib. I will definitely want to get one of it myself.
5,Very good reference,"This book is definitely a must-have for anyone interested in MEMS design. It's one of the classic references on microsystems that everyone should have read at least once.The sections on mathematical modeling are especially good, and the set of detailed examples at the end are clear and illustrative.To name some drawbacks, the chapter on fabrication is maybe a bit out of date, and more solved practical exercises are missing."
4,not that useful as a textbook,"This book is good just for a starter's guide to MEMS. It just touches a wide range of topics. But if you want to learn the subject with real understanding, then this book can not help you."
3,Entertaining and a classic.,"This movie starts good, but it get static, silly and stiff toward the mid-end of it. Overall: Fair to Good."
3,It's All About Princess Dia,"'At The Earth's Core' is sci-fi silliness from '76. There is absolutely no reason why anyone would want to watch, or own this film. Well, maybe one reason and that reason would be CAROLINE MUNRO! Yes, the beautiful Brit who played the sexy Margiana in 'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad' three years earlier is back as the scantily clad Princess Dia and she looks as incredible as ever.Watch Princess Dia in her two piece loincloth run from the dumbest looking bunch of blow-up dinosaurs and giant, woman eating, telepathic birds you've ever seen. Make no mistake about it, this DVD is for Caroline Munro fans only, a silly but lovely guilty pleasure to be sure."
2,"Cheap Entertainment, But That's It","Double ouch!!""War Gods of the Deep"" is one of Vincent Price's weakest films, and he appears disinterested throughout. Tab Hunter is unbearably stiff, and the ""comic relief"" provided by David Tomlinson and a chicken isn't funny in the slightest. Shoddy special effects and a shoddier plotline drag this movie way, way down (to the bottom of the sea, shall we say?).""At the Earth's Core"" manages to sink even lower. Doug McClure plays his role over the top, and the ""comic relief"" provided by a buffoonish Peter Cushing isn't funny either. The monsters in this film are so phony that they insult the intelligence of the viewer, even for the low standards of the 1970s. An awful plotline with an absurd romance thrown in -- there's nothing of merit to this film except unintended laughs at how bad it is.The DVD gets two stars as it was cheap entertainment and allows Vincent Price fans to see one of his more obscure (and deservedly so) films."
4,"Great, old-school Fun!","This will appeal most to 2 groups:Those who were young kids during the 1970s & those currently under 10. I fall into the 1st category, as I saw this the year it was released in theaters. Most everyone else will likely disapprove of the low-budget, primitive special effects & monsters.But if you saw this when it was 1st run like myself, or would now love to share it w. your own kids (before they're too old & jaded), & with zero worry of profanities or nudity, then this is still worth a look."
3,Camp at the earth's core,"Best summarized as ""not bad, if you take it for the fluff that it is."" If you're a fan of early sci fi, you've seen far worse and survived. It's amusing to see Cushing in a role like this, after seeing his other work."
3,"Not bad, but still campy!","What can I say? I grew up on these movies. There is a bit of nostalgia for me. I have to say that even though these movies are a bit dated [and campy], they are still fun to see"
4,"May be a bit cheesy, but a classic none the less.",An older movie with low budget special effects (ala..Godzilla ) but still engaging. I still enjoy watching it after all these years.
1,to low budget,bad everything. not worth the time. if you like old b rated movies skip this. bad script no special effects.
3,At the Earth's Core,"Another good old sci-fi classic style .great family entertainment for the sci-fi types . Possiblities abound with imagination . Action as always . Other Doug McClure movies as well , similar to this . Caroline Munro is as good as she is beautiful . Enjoyment at a nice price ."
1,No indicator for replacement,"When I ordered this product I thought I was getting the same filter as I've been buying at Home Depot, which was a BPSF30. These filters do not have the blue and yellow stripes which turn green when it's time to change the filter, even though the instructions with these filters do refer to the stripes and are the exact same instructions as come with the BPSF30 filters from Home Depot. Somehow this is misleading because these filters are NOT the same as the original ones but are sold as if they are. Shame on Amazon.com for selling these filters as if they were the same product when they're NOT."
3,"Fits Broan QS130SS perfectly, but no change indicators as described","This is the genuine Broan-branded filter pack for non-ducted installations. They fit my Allure QS130SS 30"" perfectly. The item description is incorrect concerning the use indicator on the filter, however, as noted in a previous review. The filters that I received do not have the use indicator colors described in the documentation that came with them. This is somewhat frustrating since this is a nice feature that was present on the filters that came with my original unit. The filters work fine, but the Amazon description should be corrected before additional customers buy this pack under false pretenses. The use indicator is an extremely useful feature and I would not have purchased these had I known it was not actually present. Still, they work and I need them so I am not returning them."
1,WRONG SIZE,this was sold as a package with the broan non- ducted range hood. It wasn't the size filter. I dont understand why they were sold together.
1,Not as shown or as described in specs.,"The (BPSF30) product picture and spec's are what you would buy at Homedepot, but not what arrives from Amazon. The information is inaccurate and misleading. If you order this product from Amazon, what you will get is an insert replacement; not the entire filter. I recommend going to Homedepot."
3,Product has changed.,"Like another reviewer has mentioned, the product has changed. I've used this product in the past and it came with a secondary mesh filter inside, ""clean sense filter"". I had hoped that the other reviewer had gotten a fluke but that doesn't seem to be the case. After using the filters for the last couple years, i know how long before it needs to be changed so i purchased it anyway. It came as he described it. It's missing that color sense mesh filter. The instructions are actually the same as the old ones. Those instructions need to be updated since it describes the color sense filters, features, and how it works when in reality, it is no longer there. The description on the product page needs to be updated as well. Cost cutting measures for the company?-2 stars for messing with the product."
1,DO NOT BUY THE SUGGESTED REPLACEMENT FILTER!,"I can't say if the filters are worthy of a 5 star rating, because they don't fit the model vent-a-hood I bought. They ARE however the ones listed underneath the vent-a-hood as a ""most people also buy"" item. I know I should have looked at the specifications before purchasing, but, I also would like to assume that the suggested products can actually enhance the original product being bought in some way."
2,Wrong thing,This was one of my first purchases from Amazon and I misunderstood the suggestion to buy this with a Broan range hood. I purchased it because I thought I needed it. But it did not even fit the unit that it was suggested for. I returned with no problems. And purchased the correct filter locally.
3,good product.,"I really can't rate it bc I purchased the wrong filter for what i bought. I kept it anyways, bc it was my mistake."
1,Missing the clips,"The item was supposed to come with two clips, but they were missing. It also didn't seem like it'd be the exact right fit for my GE Profile range hood which others around the internet have said it should fit."
5,great bargain,"Directions are given, easy to install plus i love the strip inside that works as an indicator. you don't see the dots on strip anymore, means it is time to put in new filters."
4,Supplement filters,These filters attached to the filters supplied with the range hood by means of two clips. Installation was quick and easy.
1,BEWARE - This filter does NOT fit a Broan Allure QS1 range hood,"I purchased this filter to replace my Broan Allure QS1 filters. This filter is too small for the QS1. The dimensions of the QS1 filter is 14 1/4"" x 11 3/4"" x 3/4"". This filter is roughly 12 1/2"" x 10 3/4 x 3/4"""
1,"Just read the title, don't bother with the ""book""","Well, it's 2 pages long. That is, if you count that it has extra large type in the title, large graphics, and a paragraph hawking his website as part of the ""book"". Overall it's really just a few vague paragraphs. Stupid me, I read a whole lot of the titles of these e-books and chose them based on the titles instead of trying one out first. I bought a bunch of them and there really are no new ideas in them. Each is 2 pages (or 3) long, with big type, graphics, large heading, and a paragraph at the end suggesting you subscribe to his website. I guess I forgot to wash the ""gullible"" off my forehead. Enjoy the $20 you made from me Dr. Nelson ... everyone else, save your money and buy a REAL book on management instead for $20. Amazon has a lot better ones to choose from."
3,Toy Story II Smartridge,"I bought this for my four year old, because she likes Toy Story and Toy Story II she was excited to see this game for V-Smile, so when we got it we put it in, and I sat down with her to see how she liked the game, she played it for maybe 20 minutes the first time, she said she didnt like it, it wasnt that fun, the part that she liked about it the most was driving the car on the road. I must say I sat down and played that one, and that one was pretty amusing. But the game all in all was only ok."
4,Great Fun! Toy Story 2,"My son loves it. He's 4 and has Spiderman & Lion King also, but so far Toy Story 2 is his favorite. Thanks"
3,You have to be in the mood for something eccentric,"I can see loving or hating Stokowski's Phas four Tchaikovsky Fifth, recorded in Decca's patented multi-mike, cinematic splashiness. But to be objective, Stoki is far over the top here. There is a great deal of goopy, soupy phrasing in the first movement, but the Scherzo is wildly pulled around. The Andante cantabile comes off relatively unscathed, but the finale is overblown in the ripest Hollywood style. I was fairly amused when the Gramophone reviewer was so repelled as to be almost phsically ill. As for myself, if I am in the mood for Tchaikovsky in carnival mode, Stoki's Fifth is one CD to grab for.This preccording has been reissued as part of Decca's two-box Stokowski omnium gatherum in their Original masters series."
5,An excellent true crime work,"Very well written, and very detailed. Very similar to Ann Rule's work if you like her."
2,BORING,"I thought this book was the most boring true crime book I have read in a long time. I can't even finish it, it's so boring."
2,Poor examples explanation,"I am not an expert in this field but what I learn are just some simple concepts. It takes some pages on the bluetooth SOC designexample with fractional C code. There is no structure about the examples and its hard to understand what the authors will explain(actually, I just feel ??what??)"
1,Unreadable,"A disorganized, random walk through history. Borrow it from a local library if you must read it, but don't waste your money buying a copy. Charles Freeman's books are better."
2,No give.,"Aesthetically, this vibrator looks very pleasing to the eye. Yet, it didn't to the trick for me. There was absolutely no give to this baby. And it didn't have an ""ease upon entry"" that other toys do. Not the toy for me. I got rid of the goddess, and kept the bullet... Which happens to work very well! So I'm giving it a few more stars for that alone."
5,Another great piece from this line,"Quality servewear, beautiful patterns and ease of cleaning make Armetale a trusted name. This pattern is elegant, yet can be used for everyday get-togethers. The chip & dip bowl is a staple in one's collection."
5,Love This for Entertaining,This bowl is a must for entertaining. You can use it for chips and dip or shrimp cocktail. You can put it in the refrigerator to chill it prior to serving your shrimp cocktail.
4,Good Levine. Great some singers.,"Levine finds the best inspiration in the coral moments (see the great ""concertato finale""). Good also the quality of the recording. Very well the duo Pavarotti (great usual class)Anderson. Excellent Ramey, actually still the best bass."
2,Scotto/Pavarotti live is THE one !!,"The violinist here must have thought the score was from Sonnambula, lethargically as it is played. Anderson sings prettily but cautiously, scooping up to notes occasionally and afraid of dramatic involvement. Levine creates little tension. Go to the RAI 1967 performance with Renata and Luciano to feel the vitality captured in early Verdi's music of exultation - it is the only version you will need."
5,John Taylor Silent Skin Rocks!,"John taylor never disappoints. His music is ever evolving and ever changing, and is never really the same thing twice. This is far different from Duran Duran.....and it ROCKS!"
4,John Taylor Japan EP,"THREE SONG SILNT SKIN,MISTER J,RUN TOGETHER AND VIDEO:ANON IN JAPAN EPNOT BAD (FOR ME) I BUY IT FOR MISTER J, RUN TOGETHER AND ANON VIDEO WELL...BECAUSE TAIWAN DID'T RELEASES AND I'M JT FANS TOO SO I MUST BUY IT (LOVE YOU JOHN)"
4,John Taylor Japan EP,"THREE SONG: SILNT SKIN,MISTER J,RUN TOGETHER ~ AND VIDEO:ANON!! IN JAPAN EP.NOT BAD (FOR ME), I BUY IT FOR MISTER J, RUN TOGETHER AND ANON VIDEO, WELL...BECAUSE TAIWAN DID'T RELEASES >_< AND I'M JT FANS TOO!!SO I MUST BUY IT.(LOVE YOU JOHN!!!)"
5,Johnny Depp,"I love Johnny Depp and this is one of my very favorite movies he has done. It's such a heart warming story, good for all ages."
2,Termperature rating is wrong,"This sleeping bag looks great. It is light and comfortable as long as it does not get below 40F.I went camping with the Slumberjack Kepler 20F Regular Right Sleeping Bag and the temperature went a little below the freezing point on a couple of occasions. I had terrible nights both time. I took off my cloth, wore more cloth and there was nothing to do, I was cold.The temperature rating on the bag is wrong. The sleeping bag is at best a 40F. I ended returning the bag. Amazon's service was great."
3,Decent Bag,"This bag is very comfortable and packs relatively small, but on the downside it is a bit heavy and the merino wool liner is sometimes itchy (particularly after a hike when dried sweat is on you). It is spacious on the inside for those who like to some wiggle room. But this also affects the overall warmth. I tried it out when the temperature got a to be about 25 degrees and the bag was pretty cold, but after putting on some shirts, tights, socks, sock cap.... it was toasty. So the rating is a bit off. But overall it is a well rounded bag for three season backpacking and will do the job."
3,Disappointing,"I've had these pliers for just over a week, and I'm sorry to say that the cutting surfaces are already notched from cutting nothing more than 10 & 12 gauge insulated copper wire. And judging by the photos on the website, the warranty doesn't cover it. These pliers feel great and seem to be very well built, but they just didn't hold up. I bought them due to budget constraints, but after spending $20 on these, I'll end up spending another $40+ for the Kleins after watching my friends cut nails with theirs. If you're a professional, skip a step, save the $20, and go straight for the Kleins."
4,Another winner for B.J.,"Having just embarked on the ""Shirley McClintock"" series, I can tell you that they are indeed enjoyable. As would be expected, there is considerabley more character development in this, the second in the series, and it is apparent that the author is really warming to her protagonist. Shirley is opinionated, intelligent, capable and warm, with very definite views on everything, a woman after my own heart. The murders are interesting and complex but not unsolvable. The secondary plot concerning a cult was a little out in left field, maybe a little extraneous, but it was all wrapped up at the end. A very good read and I am looking for the third in the series as I write this."
2,Inconsistent Caviar,"I agree with the above. It's a good product at a good price. I have ordered several times. One time, one of the jars was rotten. I opened it up and it was pretty nasty. Thought about sending it back but was too much hassle. Anyway, it's a delicious product if you want to take the gamble on the inconsistency."
2,inconsistent quality caviar,Only first time caviar was excellent quality. Subsequent orders delivereddamaged eggs. Last order delivered 1 jar with rotten eggs.
5,AMAZON'S MISTAKE,I ASKED FOR THE PORTUGUESS VERSION AND AMAZON SENT THE SPANISH ONE.ANY WAY I'M SATISFIED WITH AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE.THANKS
1,Not a fan of this at all.,I bought this thinking it would be kind of like kool-aid. It's not. It was more like adding flavor to water and the flavor was very weak.
5,De Costa Rica a Vallecas un abrazo,"Que gran CD este de ska-p, de una forma bastante irreverente y comica dice las verdades tal y como lo piensan. Totalmente recomendado si te gusta el rock con los matices latinos del ska. Una gran variedad musical y tematica..... deberian acercarse a dar una vuelta por latinoamerica!"
3,Petit groupe sympathique d'Espagne mlant joie et rythme,Rythme et ambiance endiablés pour ce groupe qui perce actuellement en France et qui promet pour la suite ! Il ne faut pas aimer les chansons calmes!!!
5,skaconciencia,"SKA-P es lo más grande que hay, al fin una banda que puede transmitir lo que sienten los animales de laboratorio, y ponerte la pìel de gallina."
1,So sad,i was so looking forward to the arrival of this item when my money was refunded and I was informed it was not coming. Boo hoo! Nothing would make me happier to be notified that something similar was in stock for a comprable price and being able to have first crack at purchasing it.
2,Looked great for a day,"The screen was amazing, so clear in HD, and progressive scan dvd. Then we noticed a blue line going from top to bottom on the right side of the screen. Looks like I will be returning it. I will exchange it, and hope the next one performs better since it looked so good."
1,This is an e-book?,"For this I paid $1.95? It's a page and a half! I feel taken, I can get more information from the cover jacket of any empowerment book."
2,"Not the best of Vera, by a couple of decades...","Vera Lynn became famous for the WW II hit, ""White Cliffs of Dover"" and went on to a long career. This CD compliation features tracks from quite late in that career, and frankly, few of them are interesting. Most seem over-long, and under-sung, and frankly, dull. If you really want her version of one of these titles, go for it. This was my own first and only exposure to this singer, and I wouldn't be interested in any additional stuff by her if I based my choice on this disc alone. However, I have a friend who says there are some fine Vera Lynn CD's out there. My suggestion is to find the original performances from the '40's first, and save this collection for last."
3,"GREAT BOOK, LOTS OF TYPOS","I really like this book and the pictures of deatials on the aircraft, but there are WAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY too many typos in this book. In the first 3 pages I found about 4 typos."
4,Not a boring story,"Upon reading the premise of this book I assumed it was going to be the typical marriage of convenience turned into something more type of book just as another reviewer had stated earlier. Well, it WAS that but also much more. Despite the overused plot, I found myself glued to the pages. This is exactly what I look for in a book: Dimensional characters, likeable heroes/heroines, and an interesting plot (a little excitement and some sexual tension is an added bonus, one that is present in this book).Like another reader, I thought the giggling early on was annoying... WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GIGGLING FOR?? I suppose because, while I do laugh when completely baffled by events, her circumstances were beyond bafflement encroaching on tragic.One gripe which kept the fifth star off... (No longer!!! 1/08) I reread this book and found the error was mine. Too bad I can't add that fifth star. But all in all a WONDERFUL book. I loved the characters. Fun,funny, exciting... well done!"
3,"Cute story, but disappointing...","After reading many good reviews on this book here at amazon, I drove out to my library and picked up this book, expecting a well-written novel with a compelling love story. I was pretty disappointed. The story has been told hundreds of times in the Christian romance world (a marriage of convenience turning into something more), but that wasn't what bothered me. The writing was too forced and rushed, and it was hard to get invested in the story. I found myself uninterested in the characters at times, and though I really wanted to love this book, I ended up only liking it a little in the end."
2,pina4,"I expected to receive the entire performance. What I received was one CD out of a two CD set. Fortunately, it contained the one piece that I was most interested in, but I feel cheated. This is the second time this happened with Amazon. I will take my business elsewhere."
4,Good for just the test,"First of all, I just passed the test with very comfortable score. I did prepare for this test with this book along with MS training guide. It is very difficult to remember exactly where did the questions come from, but here is the overview to those who are starting to prepare.This book is meant just for this test. It has a very direct focus on the test. Many times, it is much more useful if one has the background information which this book does not necessarily cover. So, in my opinion, starting the preparation with the training guide and finishing with this book is a good strategy to pass the test and also, to become a good DBA ( which is more important)."
1,Wow! How disappointing.,"I've been a big fan of the Exam Cram series, starting back with 60-067 (Networking Essentials to you youngins), but they have steadily gone downhill as Ed Tittel takes more & more of a backseat.This book contains errors right off the bat, confusing the different types of RAID volumes. This I have been around enough to spot right away, but what about the stuff I'm trying to learn. There could be more blatent mistakes, causing me to learn the material incorretly. The editor should have caught that.The book is poorly written & a chore to read. The author's examples are sad at best. This is by far the worst of the 3 books I'm using. I've been a Sys Eng for 8 years & been working with SQL, doing installs & maintenance for about 3 years, but this book contains little relevant/useful information. The author would have done better to just state facts & examples, & not try to explain anything."
4,"A good exam cram, but you need other resources.","I first purchased the Microsoft Press book and thought it had too much information in some areas and little or no information in others.The Exam Cram seems to fill the holes and summarizes other topics that MSPress covered in too much detail.Even with all the info covered in both books I dont feel like it's enough, so I also research on the web and have access to a SQL server. A third book probably couldnt hurt.I gave it 4 stars because I consider a 5 star book to be the only book I would need to study for an exam."
3,Study Guide Only!!!!,"After reading this book, I felt it was lacking in details and possibly had more than a few errors. Although it is a study guide, with some good challenging practice questions, I can not help but emphasize for a few dollars more you could get a better study guide that would be far more useful and prepare you better."
3,Incorrect names for equipment but good book,"I would really like this book but unfortunately the author uses the wrong names for some of the construction equipment. We will continue to enjoy the book until my daughter learns to read. After that...The most glaring misname is the crawler EXCAVATOR which Tana calls a crawler backhoe. The wheeled backhoe is referred to as a backhoe. Plus forklift is normally used for the small machines you think of in warehouses not the larger construction site equipment.For those who are really interested the other industry names are Manlift (cherry picker), Telescopic Handler (forklift), Telescopic Handler being used like a crane (forklift crane)."
3,Works well,"What can you say - It works, Clips on to side of pitcher easily, but the storage case is sucky!"
4,Great product Makes it so easy!,I had to guess when to finish frothing the milk but with this great easy to read gauge it is so easy to know when to stop. It's also easy to adjust to the size of the container.
2,Why do I get different item from what I ordered ? ? ?,Is there any specific reason why Amazon get me different item from what I ordered ??CDN IRB220-F ProAccurate Insta-Read NSF Beverage & Frothing Thermometer
2,disappointing all around,"Sadly, I bought this product based on the image and the average product review; I wish I had actually read the individual reviews. As several people state, the thermometer you receive is not the one pictured here. It features Celsius as well as Fahrenheit measurements, which makes everything smaller and more difficult to read. The thermometer read slowly, and jerkily; would never call it ""instant."" Clip fits poorly on my 12 and 20oz frothing pitchers. Basically no redeming qualities aside from it's cheap, and available on prime. Already returned this product and bought another one; I will add a product link if I like it."
2,"Good Product, Big Product","The product description says it's, ""great for a small frothing pitcher"". This is more for a medium- to large-sized pitcher (too big for my 10oz pitcher). If looking to purchase, be mindful of the size."
5,Good thermometer for milk frothing pitchers!,"We use this thermometer on our milk frothing pitcher for our espresso machine. It clips to the side of our small pitcher and is easy to read. The stem is shorter so it works great for a pitcher, it might be a little too short to use on the side of a saucepan etc. though. That said, it gives a quick reading and is perfect for our purposes. I highly recommend."
1,very low quality,the needle movement is jumpy when heating up water. I feel like i need to flick it with my finger to get the real temperature. accuracy is questionable.
1,Thermometer won't position properly,"I've had this type of thermometer before and was pleased, but this brand has a clamp to keep it in position that simply does not work. It ends up flopping around."
2,not the greatest,I was disappointed with this...it is hard to open and you can't hardly hear the person on the other line. It is fairly easy to use as far as figuring out the menu...not a lot of frills.
1,Buy this for a good lesson on why you should always back up any files you want to keep,"Y'know, I have never had any trouble with the other two external hard drives I own (a Maxtor and a Western Digital), and what I should have done was stick to what I know. But I didn't, and now here I am barely 6 months after I received my now nonfunctional Beyond Micro external hard drive writing a buyer beware. You can do better than this one. Shop around and spend a little more money on a product that will work like you need it to. Or if you don't, back up your files. Seriously."
5,wow.,"What a set of pliers!! Not only is there NO play between the 2 pieces but they grip perfectly, and they align perfect! I love these pliers and would recommend them to anyone reading this review, PLEASE buy them!! you will love them! I promise!!"
3,Not complete songs,"I was excited about this because I love piano music and all the songs that are included on this album and am familiar with Dino's talent. Unfortunately, each CD was more of a sampler of each song on the playlist with only 1 long ""song"" on the whole CD to where you could not skip to the next song...you just had to listen to the whole thing. Each of the 3 CDs were the same way. Maybe my set was dysfunctional, but I was disappointed that it was recorded in such a manner."
3,"Stories from the ""edge""?","I'm not sure what this ""edge"" is supposed to be,but these are very unique horror stories and I highly reccomend you buy this if you like horror anthologies.There is a wonderful new (to Americans) French female author who, I feel, has the best horror story so far. (I'm only 1/2 way through it as of yet.) Great authors. Not exactly splatterpunk horror, but horror of a creeping,twitching kind."
5,MAGNIFICO SEGUNDO ALBUM!!,"La segunda gran entrega que esta gran Diva de la musica clasica nos ha dado; que magnifica seleccion de canciones y que voz mas preciosa!! entre las canciones mas maravillosas estan ""EN ARANJUEZ CON TU AMOR"" (Mi favorita, que gran interpretacion y excelente orquestracion), ""O SOLE MIO"" (Pura italia!), ""TIME TO SAY GOODBYE"" (Simplemente fabulosa), ""BARCAROLLE"" (Una de las mejores versiones que he oido de esta pieza), ""VA PENSIERO"" (Que elegancia), ""O HOLY NIGHT"" (me trajo muy bellos recuerdos de mis navidades pasadas) y ""VIDE COR MEUM"" (que duo mas fantastico hace ella con el tenor que la acompaña); Katherine siempre nos sorprende con su voz, su belleza y sobre todo con su carisma, y deseo que su paso a WARNER MUSIC produzca bellezas igual de maravillosas que las que produjo en su increible periodo con UNIVERSAL."
3,Katherine Jenkins,"I must say this is by far my favorite album. She has improved her vocal skills from her first album to this album. Katherine Jenkins definitely impressed me with her singing of Seguidilla, she sings with an exquisite technique. I have the ""LA Diva"" album and I had to get this release because of the added tracks of Vide Cor Meum, Barcarolle, and O Holy Night!"
5,Beautiful Voice,"Katherine has a beautiful voice. Her music is so relaxing and enjoyable. She is a wonderful talented artist. I love her music and can't get enough of her performances both on CD's, DVD's and in person."
3,Not bad but not great either.,"Suspense, it had some. Characters that you cared about, not so much. I felt rather meh about all the main characters. I also found there were way to many conveniences popping up in the story line. The plot was a little weak and the ending fizzled a little. Overall it was ok. So not bad but not great either. I will say it was well written, I didn't find any spelling errors. Although I did find an odd repeat of the word yellow. lol. A very quick read, read this while the Packers/Vikings game was playing on Sunday. Packers won, Yay!"
4,A wonderful introduction to Poetry for your 4-7 year old!,"I checked this out of the library for my almost 5 year old daughter, and we both enjoyed reading it. Basically, the book spends a few pages describing the qualities of the wind during each season. But it uses a very poetic language, full of metaphor and personification. For my daughter, it was a wonderful introduction to poetry. We would read a sentence, then talk about what it meant, and why the author chose to use the words she did rather than simply stating it in matter-of-fact terms. It lead to discussions on other ways to say things poetically. For instance, rather than simply saying she had blonde hair, we could say she ""had hair of gold.""The book is just the perfect length to hold the interest of young children, and is a pleasant read for adults. The illustrations are pleasing, as well, and they very much fit the tone of the book."
4,women should rule this world,"I' ve seen the film, and the music was nice sssss!!, smooth guitar and drums. I enjoyed both the movie and the music. 4 lovely females, feeding you with life.Enjoy.(eyvallaa!)"
1,"The Law of Success: Using the Power of Spirit to Create Health, Prosperity, and Happiness","i never received this book!!! i am very upset and would like this seller to know such. if it was just an error, please have the seller send it to me a.s.a.p.!!!thank you.jenn"
5,A treasure of wisdom,"I know this booklet for 25 years and it has guided me through most of my life. It is basically a compendium of the wisdom necessary to succeed in life. Yet it is not about the success based on careers and possessions, but in the ability to live in harmony with the laws of the universe, promulgated by a Superior Intelligence. Yogananda, a really enlightened spiritual mentor, kwnown even before that ""self-help"" was a commercial product, offers in twelve brilliant short essays all you need to know to attain happiness, prosperity and fulfillment in this generation, in these times. A real treasure, a formidable source of advise and comfort."
1,Not an official publication!,"This book and all others with Yogananda's first name, Paramahansa, spelled 'Paramhansa' (without the 'a' after the 'm') is not an official publication! One has to be diligent because Swami Kriyananda took, without permission, all of Yogananda's sacred writings (and other media items) and altered them. He has been making money off of Yogananda's name ever since he got kicked out of SRF! The Law of Success: Using the Power of Spirit to Create Health, Prosperity, and Happiness is the one actually published by the official organization that Yogananda, himself, founded: Self-Realization Fellowship.To be sure you are reading an official book from SRF and its purity, look for the SRF/YSS emblem of a lotus flower with a star in a circle or contact the SRF headquarters in Los Angeles with any questions."
5,A Great Man does it again!!,Great words from a great man wish he was still on the planet. Words of wisdom just pour from this being!!!
4,Felt very good,I felt really happy when i read this book.This book is very much inspiring who ever reads it I practised many contents of this book and felt that they are working very well.Finally i thank the author for sharing those views and plead him to write many more books like this.Thank you.
3,Small booklet,"This tiny, 34 page, booklet was certainly not worth the price. I wouldn't have bought it if the ad had made it clear it is not a book. Not saying the information in the booklet isn't good - but far better to get it and much more by reading Autobiography of a Yogi by the same author!"
5,The essential rule of happiness summarised.,"This book is very short and every word is carefully considered. I have read many such works over the years such as ""Think and Grow Rich"", the works of Michael Rowland and many others. All of them point in the same direction and this book distills the learning. The law of success set out here covers all human success, such as relationships, raising children etc. It is a privilege to have this information provided to us in such an easy to read format. My thanks to Paramhansa Yogananda."
3,"Call me crazy, but i thought it was worth the $13.95!","All of the critizism you have read is true. This book IS too short. It really has 10 pages of original work, each oversized and spread out across two pages. But, I really thought the work he did do was masterfully done. I thought he could cover a lot more though. Out of almost 3,000 people who died in the Twin Towers, Art Spiegleman doesn't even mention one. This is in sharp contrast to his great Maus books.Despite the drawbacks, I believe this work is worthwhile. I was dissapointed that half the book was reprints of very old comic strips, but the ""Little Nemo"" strip where Little Nemo is on top of a building in NYC and says ""They are looking for us! We must get down from here"" moved me, reminding me of the poor souls caught on the roof of the World Trade Center. You do get an honest look inside Mr Spiegleman's mind about the 911 tragedy."
3,bent board book,"I'm disappointed in this purchase. It's a large format board book; alas, it is curved, bending up at the edges, not to an extreme, but it does not lay flat. This was not mentioned in the product description. I don't believe the bend occurred in the mailing; the mailer seemed protective enough."
2,expectations were too high,After reading Maus i loved it and it caused my expecatations for this book to be too high.
2,Disappointing,"This book had the potential to be so much more. The artwork (especially the cover) is amazing, being Speigleman, but the ranting and self-pity grows very tiresome. I agree with (most) of his politics too, but the self-important tone of the book bugged me. The old comic strips that make up half of the book are interesting, but not as fascinating to me as they are to the author. I guess he needed to add something to keep the book from becoming a 10 page pamphlet."
2,What happened?,"I read and loved Maus. To me, those books are an important part of history and literature. So when I went and got Shadow, I was expecting something a lot better than this!This work was in no way moving. It was too short, and I never really got the point. It seemed like Spiegelman just got tired of writing/drawing about what happened. There was little continuity (maybe there wasn't supposed to be) and so much blame tossed around, it took away from the emotion that should have been directed at the victims and witnesses.Check this out from the library (thank God I did). Don't spend money on this."
1,"this ""book"" is only about 20 pages","it's not a graphic novel like ""Maus"" was at all.I would return it, but it's not even worth it....."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I thought this would be more of a story of the artist's personal experience & less political. I don't disagree with his politics, but it was still somewhat of a disappointment. Spiegelman's artwork is always amazing, often moving & thought provoking. I was really moved by his quote: ""I finally understand why some Jews didn't leave Berlin right after Kristallnacht!"" I also enjoyed the section on old political cartoons"
2,Half a Dozen Pages,"I think that Spiegelman could write a serious piece on the aftermath of 9/11 but this is not it. This scant group of strips were written more as catharsis than examination. As a record of how many felt at the time, it's accurate. As an interesting story, it's empty. If these pages were in a collected work or a biographical work they would be of more interest than as a stand alone group. Using classic strip characters from the early 1900's is going to be emotionally distancing for some readers. While the art choice is Spiegelman's, the result is not always successful. It's hard to emotionally connect with a narrator holding you at such stylized length. Without the wide breadth of the city (or even Spiegelman's) experience the work comes off like a minor tract than a true statement. Niche market may love it but it won't appeal to many fans."
2,"Get over yourself, Chuck!","Although there are a few chapters where I felt otherwise, for the most part, I kept getting the same sense reading this book, as you would if talking to someone who likes to listen to themself. After a while, you're crying ""enough already!"" If you like to read Gierach or Middleton or someone of that style, then I'd go in another direction than this title. Mr. Gaines seems a little too caught up in himself in this book. When he gets away from the narcissism, the book is not too bad, but those points seem to few for me."
1,Pedestrian and Humorless,"At best, fly fishing is a delerious obsession, at worst, a celebration of consumerism and elitist values. It has inspired a first-rate literature. Unfortunately, Gaine's book isn't part of it. Condescending portraits of fishing guides? The world's best ($750/day) fly fishing lodge? Gaines tries to hold out his pedestrian observations on the up-scale fly-fisher's lifestyle as some sort of unique and noble sensibility. He fails. Humour and any real insight into fishing are notably absent. Give this one a miss."
2,A disappointment,"I paid significantly more for ""Made in USA""--but what a sorry tool this turned out to be. Quality control must have been asleep or absent the day they finished this pair of Linesman Pliers, and the tip had either been over-ground or misground, resulting in obvious grinding marks from a coarse wheel, with a tip that's rough and about .025"" narrower than it should be.While still serviceable, it won't replace the old ""made in Japan"" pair in my toolbelt and I'll just toss it in my ""spare tools"" drawer for emergency use."
3,Interesting or not? Depends,"This is much more a leisure book than a reference one, despite the author's statement on the front cover ""Expert Advice on how to..."", of which a reader's liking depends much on whether he/she is interested in the topics chosen by the author. Pitifully the choice of the author didnt suit me well. Anyway, i strongly suggest you to check the ""Index"" available here on Amazon before you make your purchase."
4,Wealth of Information,"I thought this was a great read! Not only was it full of useful information, the tips were short, and to the point.Want to learn how to play the guitar? Joey Ramone suggested you start when you're 16 and have some basic musical knowledge. Best time for a rich uncle to die? In 2010, when a loophole in the law temporarily repeals the estate tax.Some of my favorites that I thought were really helpful were:Best Time To Buy a New Car - end of the monthBest Time To Get Your Car Repaired - Spring/Fall & first thing in the morning.This book is chock full of excellent tips that I everyone can use. Whether you want to teach your new puppy a trick or want to know the best time to visit Europe, I highly recommend this book!"
1,Avoid,"This book had a snarky tone and a lot of useless information. I was also put off by the ""advice"" of when to have sex with hundreds of people -- which is after you've already had sex with hundreds of people. That really didn't belong in this book, especially after it was dedicated to the author's family including, I assume, his daughters."
1,Not worth it,Thought this book was going to be interesting but it wasn't. It told of things that most of us wouldn't even think of doing.
3,"not exactly a reference book, adults only","I was hoping for a concise schedule about when to make purchases etc, but instead I've ended up ripping pages out because the content is Rated-R. 70% of the content is good, sometimes humorous, but the rest is trash.If you're looking for a reference book skip this one, unless you're willing to do your own edits. Not for kids or teens."
2,disappointed,"It's been a month, and I still haven't recieved the product to review. very disappointed in the service. maybe I can write a review if I ever recieve it"
2,"good product, bad communication from seller","Product was good, but seller was so SLOW shipping. Product showed shipped but never arrived. Contacted them and said they would ship again, took forever to receive product that time too. Will never go with this seller again."
5,Pretty & Sturdy Scroll Bookends,"I'm also really pleased. Needed bookends to hold up over a dozen architecture/coffee table books that were too outsized to fit inside a barrister bookcase in our living room. Style of the bookends suits the room & even though some of the books being supported are almost double the height of the bookends, the latter are holding them up securely. The true test will be to see if neither the bookends nor the books will tilt, topple, and tumble when the cats try to jump up there too (!), but so far, these bookends are absolutely doing the job.Note also that the 5 stars reflects the material and quality in relation to price. I researched a lot of bookends on line and they can be really expensive. Sure, these are made in China and made of resin, but they're solid, heavy, and under $20, while not looking really cheap or chintzy."
3,OK,"The weight and sizes are good, although i'd like a bigger one and not so tiny one. I used the tiny one to make some sandwich cookies at Christmas. the bad thing about these is that even after several washings, they tend to leave metal behind. The first time I used them (after a regular hand washing), i noticed that my biscuits were gray on the rim. turns out, the metal was rubbing off. I rewashed them all and they still left metal behind. i then scoured them with a stainless steel scrub. that seemed to work better; at least it no longer leaves residue on my biscuits. but it still gets all over my hands and i have to wash my hands before i can rework the left over pieces of dough for more biscuits. kind of a pain...I would not buy these again."
1,didn't have all four cutters in the little box!! :(,"Very unhappy. I waited a while to buy this set..why? If you're wondering why, I guess it's because I'm a baker and I already have cutters, but none are as deep as these. I received the order today and find either the largest or second largest cutter is missing. (I'll have to go measure to see which one isn't there but it's one of the big ones.) I'm pretty unhappy about the whole thing.You see I HAVE cutters and I went and bought more of the same except I needed deep ones for a special BIG biscuit recipe for Thanksgiving. Yes, we'll have our biscuits. But no, I won't have all four sizes for biscuits and cookie baking and petit fours I'll be making in the next couple of weeks.(sigh)"
5,Biscuit cutters,"These are the best value for the price. You have all 4 sizes to use for cookies, biscuits and small snacks. The weight is perfect and the handles very sturdy. Would recommend this product to all levels of cooks."
5,great set of biscuit cutters,I am glad I ordered this 4 pc set of biscuit cutters and will use them frequently.Superb quality.
4,They work great but...,The sizes are smaller than I like for biscuit making. My fault for not paying closer attention to the dimensions before ordering. Chances are I will only end up using the largest size which is actually not all that big. Still they work beautifully & store nicely.
5,Perfect for biscuits,Nice and sharp but sturdy. It's also great that there are so many choices of sizes- so you never have to worry about it being too big or too small. The deepness is also super useful as it makes it so it doesn't bulge over the top. Really it's a great product i'm excited to use. And the storage is great-- they all fit inside eachother like those dolls. I'm a fan.If you make biscuits or cookies these are what you're looking for.
1,broken and uneven handles,Handle was broke off of one cutter when i opened the box. Others have handles that are uneven and probably wont last long.
3,Not the right ones,"These are not the right ones for my roll making, they leave water stains on them and forever, look dull and dirty!!! I have ordered 3/4 to finally find the right one, for which I did. Do your home work for what ever your needs might be, for you can save yourself a lot of money."
4,Modern Natural Law,"John Finnis is probably the most famous now living philosopher in the Natural Law tradition of Aquinas. This work is clear, readable and challenging. A good introduction to his more demanding work ""Natural Law and Natural Rights""."
4,A forgotten classic!,"Another way to jog the memory of baby boomers (at least the boys anyway) is to pop in a tape of Tobor 8th Man! A murdered policeman is brought back to life as a robot and procedes to fight super villians, this was 25 years before Robocop! No doubt this forgotten gem of a cartoon from the early 60's was the inspiration for Robocop. While it may seem lame by today's standards, it was first rate in its day. Plus it was smart for a kid's cartoon, the characters had some depth and emotion. A forgotten sci-fi classic. I just wish it were available on DVD!"
1,Let the Buyer Beware!!,"I'm very disappointed in the tool I received. It is not at all like the pictured item or like the #358 I already own. This is one of the problems with mail order, if I had been able to inspect the tool that I was going to be sent I would not have purchased it. Oh well, that's what I get for trying to save a couple of bucks. I should have gone to the hardware store and then I would have known what I was getting. If this is the future of Channellock tools, I'll have to switch to Klein's. They're still made the good old way. The bean counters have ruined another good company."
1,Beware of the picture!,"The item received was not the item shown. Looks like they now corrected the picture, but I really wanted the older model, which had a much stronger design."
3,The Golden Age Of The Piano,"Informative and well done. But not as good as The Art Of The Piano which unfortunately seems no longer to be in print. If I had to choose one, I prefer The Art Of The Piano which covers much the same ground but is more up to date and includes fascinating in depth commentary."
4,Best pianists of the 20th. century,Excellent chance to hear the best pianist of the 20th century. A must buy for all piano lovers.
5,GREAT,We got this to put in our 4 yr olds stocking and he loved it. He is really interested in tornados
5,Perfect for tornado fun!,"We used these at Girl Scout camp to make tornados. The girls enjoyed this project SO much! You can loosen or tighten to control the amount of air. We added food coloring, but don't let the colors get too dark or it'll be harder to see the tornado option. My own daughter loved her tornado action so much we had to bring this project home for continued play. Loved an earlier recommendation to add other items to make it even more fun - like a monopoly house."
4,A Glorious Ring,"These recordings were among the first I ever obtained as a young man, and they had a dramatic effect on my musical tastes and preferences in subsequent years. Unfortunately, they were the vinyl records, and I haven't played them in years. Only days ago, I ordered the complete set, and can't wait to get it. Nilsson's Brunnhilde has NEVER been surpassed, in my opinion. She has become, for me, like Callas for many others....a veritable Goddess! Beyond her perfect contribution to the recording, there is the very strong cast, even in minor roles that make this set special. I have heard the criticism of Solti, and the 'sonic' manipulations that were injected into this set. As far as the former is concerned, I simply don't agree. Solti, to my way of thinking, provides a near-perfect interpretation, and the Vienna Philharmonic are nothing short of superb!"
5,Simply the Best,"Not only the greatest Ring, but one the greatest recordings ever made. It was a combination of a conductor and an orchestra at the right time. Solti has enough dramatic energy. But truly it was the '60's Vienna philharmonic that made this one of the greats. The sweet sound of the strings and the greatest horn section ever assembled. As for the cast, unfortunately Melchior and Flagstad were not around, but this cast is still better than any other out there baring perhaps some live recording."
2,"Decca classics, go to work!!","I was lucky enough to get 2 copies of the Esoteric Remastering of this recording (still not ideal - they have used the 20 Bit 88Hz 1997 remastered tapes that, in its wish to ``clean up`` the recording, went as far as to wipe out, for example, the woodwinds that play alongside the Walhall`s theme at the very end of the cycle); lots of people weren`t lucky, because of the astronomical price and the limited number of copies (why, on Earth...) of this edition; so Decca classics, move your big fat a$$ and get us a proper DSD-SACD Hybrid edition directly made form the original tapes! Many listeners have a completely distorted idea of this masterpiece due to his ultimate incompatibility with the CD medium and the early digital system and the above-mentioned `politically`- correct`` last remastering...carry on, ``soldier``!"
2,Pretty Mediocre and the Sound is Trash,"I echo more so the one-star comments, but since this is an 'historic"" recording (pace the Keilberth and Krauss versions) I'll cut it some slack. Whoever mastered the CD transfer should pretty much give us back our money-shrill and glaring. Was this better on vinyl? Perhaps. Give me the Clemens Krauss--PLEASE! Solti gives us no flow, or drama, just little bits and pieces cobbled together."
2,Not the genuine article,"Whatever people say, I can't help feeling that Culshaw wanted to ""conduct"" these recordings from the control room. All his tricks, editing and balances are very tiring, the truth is that the Ring doesn't sound like this at all in the theatre. This recording made Solti a famous conductor, but why DECCA chose a little known conductor from Munich in the first place? There were LOTS of great conductors active at the time> Klemperer, Knappterbusch, Szell, De Sabata, Monteux, Kubelik, Kempe, etc. I second those who prefer Bohm's cycle, it is quite simply a more honest performance, and it shares some of Solti's best singers."
3,surely you're joking,"Karajan in 5th place?! Karajan's is a wonderful recording -- lucid, balanced, and better quality sound than Solti. You'll hear orchestral details in this one you won't hear anywhere else."
4,"Good, but tiring","Wagner is excellent, and this is surely a well-written piece, but do not plan on listening to this in a single evening. The whole opera is many, many hours long, and it can be exhausting. However, the music is often worth the sheer effort it takes to listen to. Even the average listener will recognize ""The March of the Valkyries"" and some of the other more famed pieces. However, if the thought of devoting hours and hours of time to listening to a single piece daunts you, I would suggest the album ""Opera - Wagner: Ring of Nibelungen (Highlights) / Haitink"". Also good for understanding the 'Ring' is an explanation by Anna Russell on ""The Anna Russell Album"". She is extraordinarily witty and makes the sometimes obtuse opera plot understandable. All in all, a great piece."
1,the most overrated recording (not to mention Wagner) ever,"Not only is this the most overrated recording ever, it is, in my opinion, conducted by one of the most overrated conductors in the history of music. don't waste your money. i don't even give it one star ( i had to give it one according to the format). as a reviewer below said, solti has received more grammy's than any conductor. that certainly should tell you something."
1,bad,The music is too long and boring. Give me an Italian opera anytime. Wagner is not my cup of tea.
5,One of the great recording achievements of all time,"I don't pretend to be able to rate this Ring against others, since I haven't heard all of them. Further, I don't need to criticize others in order to reassure anyone contemplating purchasing the Solti Ring that it is well worth the price.The most interesting aspect of the debate about which Ring is best (if there's a right answer to such a subjective question) is that everyone who promotes another recording for that title always compares it to this. ""Here's why I think Karajan, Bohm, Furtwanger, Clemens, etc. is better than Solti."" The fact is that the Solti recording is always the benchmark that even those who prefer other recordings find themselves using.Gramaphone Magazine still rates the Solti recording ahead of all others and Wagner critic William Berger (See his Wagner Withour Fear) notes that it remains the standard choice."
5,"A monument, now given the digital transfer it deserves.","More than enough perhaps has been written on the performance itself so more from me is probably not needed. The major concern to prospective buyers might be the quality of transfer given the unimpressive early individual issues on CD. The idea of noise suppression of any sort is normally an instant no-no but in this case it works brilliantly. I have the original(ish) vinyl and this boxed set has nearly all of the 'color' of the original issues. Goose-bumps all over. Wonderful! Quibble: Flimsy packaging may not stay the course as long as the discs themselves. Additional recommendation: Do yourself a favor and order a copy of the Cooke guide to the Ring (see elsewhere in this listing) at the same time for maximum enjoyment, particularly if coming to these works for the first time."
4,"Still the best, but...","Great performances by all, unsurpassed by any other I've heard, plus wonderful sound effects, but the original sound has been somewhat degraded by a ""de-hissing"" process, compared with the original CD of excerpts. Too bad."
5,The Greatest Listening Experience You Can Ever Have,"I have owned three versions of this classic recording. My first as a set of cassette tapes that I worked part-time one summer just be be able to purchase. The second version was an early CD recording, and my third purchase was this remastered set.This is the definitive listening experience for anyone who loves music, art, poetry and literature. I have long felt that the musical drama is the apogee of art, in that it combines so many art forms into one experience: poetry, music, singing, instrumentation, narrative, costume design, and set design.One does not experience all of these by listening to a CD recording, but we all cannot travel to Bayreuth every time we want to experience Wagner.I own many recordings of THE RING, and eack one has something to offer. But for sheer enjoyment and power, Solti's RING is it for me. It is my desert island disc set!"
3,The only thing out there,"Best in it's field. Also the only thing in it's field. There is no other computer-aided Burmese study aid for English speakers. Aids both in the squiggle-circle text that is written Burmese, and spoken Burmese as well. Covers only basic words and phrases.My Burmese wife tells me that some of the translations are wrong.Also, some of the text most obviously does not match the spoken word.Still, it's better than the non-existent competition. I would causiously recommend this - the errors are not so severe as to make it useless."
1,"Has more than 30IU alpha-tocopherol, BAD!!!","Hopefully amazon will keep the link below but just incase, based on sound research such as studies conducted at John Hopkins University to much alpha-tocopherol can increase your chances for cancer not decrease. Yes you want a supplement with all the portions of vitamin E found in nature or nothing at all but you want to limit the daily intake of alpha-tocopherol to well below 100 IU and with at least 40 mg gamma-tocopherol, preferably 60 mg.[...]"
5,Utterly delightful,"A musician friend played some Mozart divertimenti as dinner music a few months ago and I found the music so delightful that I looked up this complete set, read the reviews, and bought it. It is a pleasure to put several of these Cds into the player and have Mozart's mind in the environment, while reading, dining, painting a room. The playing is polished, the recording quality great. Everything sounds fine on the CD player, but disc 1 generates massive distortion when imported into iTunes. I worked around that by importing via Windows Media Player, which somehow must equalize the playback volume to a sane level, and then imported the resulting audio files into iTunes. Perfect!"
4,GREAT Product,I have the bottle pod and I take it everywhere I go.I keeps the bottle cold to the point sometimes by baby wont take it unless I warm it up a little bit.I have also taken it to Brazil and to the beach and it kept the bottle cold for about 4 hours of very hot weather. I Highly recommend it for warm weather. I also recommend the passifier POD as well.
5,St Cecilia,"THis Mass of Haydn is less performed than some of this other masses, and this is a good interpretation. Very happy with this CD and performance"
4,Very Well Done,"I watched this video as part of my research for a biography on Gandhi for my AP World History class. It is all original footage, and it is very well put-together. Short and informative, this video is a wonderful testament to the life and influence of this great man."
2,Expensive and boring,"I can't believe this little tiny book is almost $40 new. I am glad I picked up a used copy for considerably cheaper. Overall the book itself is pretty dry and boring to read I also found it annoying how the author constantly tried to make points by making references to books, plays, films etc. that I haven't read or seen! How can I be expected to follow along when I don't know what it is you are referring too or talking about. You need to have read, and remember, 30-40 different stories/books to be able to follow this one."
1,Source info,"I can't address the content of this piece except to say it includes a reference to Yale University (see below). What I can say is that an article by this name and by this author ran in McClure's magazine in 1905 (June Volume 25, Issue 2). A related piece ran in July, 1905, ""The College Athlete: His Amateur Code: Its Evasion and Administration"" (Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 260). These details (and the Yale connection) come from ""The early history of football at Yale Contemporary sources"" in a Critical Sport Studies (Anthro 282) on-line syllabus [...]Taylor Branch cited a McClure's ""muckraker"" addressing Yale (football) coach Walter Camp in the same era but didn't specify these or other pieces, in the October, 2011, Atlantic magazine article ""The Shame of College Sports"" [...]My low rating reflects my limited knowledge of the piece."
4,Strongs,"I want to comment on the above post. The reason Strong's only works in one translations is because the KJV is the only Bible verson that is indexed with the strongs numbering system. Even in the best computer bible software only the KJV and NSAB is a person able to keylink the Strong's. So this is not a problem with the design of the software, but with the limitations of the cross-reference."
1,"Great show, bad sale.","Though I have not bought this title, i have a complaint. First I'd like to say that the show is great and the show gets 5 stars. The problem is that you need to record it on your own disc or something like that. Why can't they just manufacture a DVD or BLU-RAY copy of it and sell that to us. I don't want to have a recordable disc sitting on my DVD shelf, i want a good quality DVD with a good, actual case with artwork on it. If not it looks bad. That's what is preventing me from buying this. If i am dead wrong please tell me, and politely please."
1,"Looks good, no sound","I have a 2nd Generation iPod Nano and my wife needed a simple audio recorder for a couple interviews so I thought, ""THIS IS PERFECT!"" I read the reviews here and comically thought, ""Oh, some people had bad luck and got malfunctioning ones, maybe mine will be great!"" Lo-and-behold, 4 days after I ordered it I received my very own defective MicroMemo. *sigh* Now I get to go through the process of either just returning or getting a hopefully-working replacement."
4,Decent recorder for the money,"I like the design of this recorder--fits my 2G Nano. I also like the detachable, flexible mic. Oddly, this item does not play well w/the XtremeMac MemoMic. Simply does not record w/this mic attached. (However, the MemoMic works w/my Griffin iTalk recorder.) Go figure. I do like the playthru to headphone/speaker feature. All in all, recommended."
5,screaming does not equal emotion,"Don't believe the negative reviews about this CD. Just because a singer actually sings doesn't mean that the songs are any less emotional. Granted, the songs on this CD are more palpable than their previous efforts but that doesn't make the band any less ""punk"" or the songs any less brilliant. Against Me! is still way better than most of the schlock that's out there in the ""punk"" scene or any other scene for that matter."
5,One of the greatest bands,"wow, ok, where to begin, Against Me! is simply amazing this album is awesome! Some people complain that it's sounds over produced compared to reinventing axl rose, but it's still against me! the more i listen to the album the better it gets. They are awesome, and if you like there albums, you should see them live cause they're even better."
4,Pulls through in the end.,"I heard the instrumental on this album and shook my head. Against Me! rocking out an instrumental is not typical, and at first I was skeptical. The songwriting didn't seem up to par. The music chugged a little too much, seemed a bit too polish for Against Me!.But as I listened more and more to the disc, and the songs began spiraling in my head, I realized ""As the Eternal Cowboy"" is a fitting progression for Against Me!. It's polished but not glossy; this sounds like punk with a budget, rather than a budget with punk in mind.It's ""Calvalier Eternal"" which utimately saves the album, though. This is pure Against Me!, and the songwriting drips with attitude. It's the sort of genre-defying song the band has come to be known for producing, and a solemn oath that they will never change, no matter how big the budget or the blurb in Spin is."
2,Loosing the greatness,I really like Against Me! I was looking forward to The eternal Cowboy to come out and now that I listen to it. It isn't all that I thought it would be. Against Me! used to just sing with pretty bad vocals but with thier heart and soul. Now still good lyrics just the music it has changed.
2,Different and the same,"I agree with a lot of other reviewers. This IS a punk cd. Lyrically it has it's moments. The vocals are a little rough but in this day and age of overproduction that makes little difference. Musically, they are a tight band but I have to agree that while the songs are diverse there is nothing new here. Now, it is hard to come up with original sounding punk rock these days so I don't hold that against them but considering all the hype sourrounding this band I expected something very novel sounding and I just didn't get it. If it weren't for all the internet p.r. this band is getting I don't think they would have garnered as large a following as they have. I am a victim of that same p.r. Don't get me wrong, these guys have talent and this is not a bad c.d. by todays punk rock standards. Just a little less hype and a little more substance would have been nice."
1,Horrifying,"All I can say is that with in 4 minutes of listening to this album I felt violently ill. I almost cried when I heard what one of my favorite bands had been reduced to. If you enjoyed Against Me! DO NOT buy this album. If you're new to Against Me! buy one of their older releases and never listen to them again. Lock your self in your room and pretend that they broke up after the release of Reinventing Axl Rose. Maybe then you can live in a beautiful fantasy world in which Against Me! has never created a bad song. Unfortunately I can never live in this fantasy world because I purchased this excuse for an album. If for some reason unbeknownst to me you enjoy crappy pop punk clichés then buy this album. However, if you enjoy original music with a meaningful message for the love of all that is holy, stay away from this album!!!Things this album stole:Jello Biafra vocals (track 1 TSR)Clash riffs (track 5 Rice and Bread)Cover Art (see Ryan Adams Gold and Rolling Stone Sticky Fingers)"
4,"aight, but it aint Reinventing Axl Rose","these songs are a lil more catchy but lyrics aren't nearly as touching as previous releases, especially Reinventing Axl Rose. Check that one out if you're ready to be stupified."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I agree with everybody else that this is a great hammock if you're not looking for anything too fancy and considering what you paid for it -- this is most likely the cheapest hammock/stand combo you can find. However, it does have it's issues -- it is definitely lopsided (although not a problem once you actually get in it), it's not terribly comfortable, and the stand could be a bit sturdier (mine was actually missing some hardware but fortunately it was cheap and could be easily replaced by a trip to the hardware store rather than dealing with the hassle of customer service). All in all, I'm pleased considering it fits my needs and I didn't break the bank, but like I said, you get what you paid for."
3,Two people? I don't think so!,"The ... description says this hammock can accommodate two adults. Not bloody likely! Maybe if those two adults were Kate Moss and Lara Flynn Boyle; but an average-weight woman and man? Uh-uh. You'd be resting on the bar of the hammock stand; this hammock is way too saggy for that.I'm a little concerned about the fact that it's made of cotton rope; I think nylon rope would be much more durable and weather-resistant. Still, it's not a bad hammock for the price (free with the purchase of the stand), and it is dangerously comfy. Practically every time I lie down on it, intending to spend some time with a book, I end up taking a nap. D'oh!I'm going to Scotchguard it and probably still take it in when the weather gets icky. We'll see how long it lasts; I won't feel ripped off if I end up buying a better hammock next year."
5,I love mine!!!,"It does stretch a little, but I weigh 190lbs, and set at the tightest links, it is heaven on earth. The stand was super simple to assemble (no screws!) and with a pillow, stress just melts away!"
5,I love it!,One piece of advice. Pick two trees MORE than 15 feet apart and use a chain at one end. The hammock will stretch with use and the chain can be used to raise it. Put the hooks a little higher than you think necessary. I think the stretching will stop over time but mine is too new for that.I was shocked at the quality for the price I paid. IT has plenty of room for 2 people and seems to be very strong. THe slightest movement will cause you to swing side to side. I think I will be able to get very use to this.
2,"Comfy, but too saggy","This hammock is comfortable, but of poor quality. One of the knots came undone in about 15 minutes of use, and after a few hours it is sagging out of control. I got it for free with the stand, so I guess you get what you pay for. I will be surprised if it makes it through the month."
1,Not that durable,"It works great, for a while... My three kids - 5, 9 and 13, made good use of it, and I kept it inside all Winter. But after about 3 months of use, the ropes had worn all the way through, and started snapping. It's useless now, and it's only July! I would expect more durability, and in this climate, much longer life."
5,I always wanted a hammock...,Great hammock! Great Relaxation!To be really comfortable lay down a sheet over the hammock and give yourself a pillow to lay on. After a few hours of laying on this the ropes will dig in if you don't put something over it. The hammock will stretch a bunch but at first I needed a chain. Once you lay in it you probably won't need a chain extention.Have fun relaxing in your summer of fun!
1,All sag!,"We had one of these a couple of years ago that worked just fine, but when we moved we left the other one and bought a new one this spring--TERRIBLE PRODUCT. I have had to twist it SEVERAL times in order to avoid sagging to where ONE person touches the ground. NO WAY that two adults could sit on this. They must have changed vendors or materials because this hammock is nothing like the old one in terms of quality."
4,Not bad for the price,"I really have enjoyed this product. I like to enjoy it with some tea and a warm afternoon. Heck the only two recommendations I would make would be: 1.) Make sure you don't let your dogs too close or they may eat it (or sleep in it), and 2.) Have a nice evening dinner to enjoy after your relaxing day on the hammock."
4,Just a Swinging!,"I bought this for really cheap and I cant wait until spring when I can use it! I didnt think that I wanted a rope hammock, but the price was right and now that I have it I love it and cant wait to use it outside!"
2,Find better quality elsewhere...,"Look closely at the photo and you can see the poor weaving quality. I bought one of these as a gift and was too embarrased to give it. I bought a Hatteras hammock from ExoticHammocks.com and it is of much better quality. Look around, there are better deals than this. Also, if you're going to leave the hammock outdoors, you're better off with a polyester hammock than cotton."
3,What you need to know...,The hammock requires 12 + feet to hang in. If you have more than 12 feet of space you can extend the length from the ring at the end to the hanging point with a proper test rope or chain. I found this out by writing to the company. The product came with no information about size.
2,Estimated life of 1 summer,"This is a very comfortable hammock and I agree that two adults fit easily.However, we purchased this hammock for Father's Day in 2001. Today, July 28, 2002 I had to throw it in the garbage. During the first summer of use the varnish faded and left bare wood. This summer, the ropes started fraying and breaking. We have retied ropes and have been able to use it until today. Four ropes broke this afternoon and left a huge hole in the center.We live in Spokane, WA and stored it inside during the fall and winter. You get what you pay for but I clearly expected this hammock to last longer than this! I'm very disappointed with the quality of this hammock."
1,Hammock is not for outdoors.,"The quality of the cotton rope is poor, and the hammock has been coming apart after only a few weeks use. It cannot take a summer rain and does not withstand any weather abuse. Bettor for the indoors, and we are sorry we bought it as an outdoor hammock."
2,hammock review,this hammock is worth the 45 dollar sale price but certainly is not worth the original 99 dollar price. this is based on its ability to withstand being left outside whin not in use. cotton rots when it gets wet. there should be better care suggestions listed with the features. but at 45 dollars it is not a bad deal if one makes the effort to keep the hammock out of the weather.
3,Omni Casaway Rope Hammock,My order was very prompt and the price was wonderful. I looked everywhere for a hammock of such good quality for so cheap. The only thing I was unhappy with it was dirty when I received it. Other than that everything was great!
3,Comfortable/Lasts 2 summers,The hammock is comfortable. It only lasted two summers before the rope broke.
1,I wouldn't buy this hammock.,We have had this hammock up in our backyard for 1 month and it is already tearing apart. The ropes have loosened and the hammock is barely off the ground when you are sitting in it. I guess the old adage is true that you get what you pay for. I wish now that I had gone to the store and paid a little more for a quality hammock. The hammock we had prior to this one lasted several years and never sagged to the ground. I think these hammocks are defective.
1,It's like it's made of elastic instead of cotton.,"I got the hammock/hammock stand combo deal... not such a good deal at all. The hammock is attached to the stand as tightly as possible, without any slack in the chain, and this hammock sags all the way to the ground with just one person. When adding a second, you may as well just lie in the grass.And it's not as though I was pushing the 400 pound weight limit -- hubby and me combine are barely 250 pounds.The most unfortunate part is that the expense to return it all negates the refund, so this ends up being over a hundred dollars thrown away."
4,Worth Reading,"It's a good book worth the reading for every programmer aspiring to be a professional. My only negative comment is that I wish the author presented a logical explanation of the reasoning behind pattern implementations before presenting the actual implementation (code). On many occassions I found myself confused as to why a certain implementation was chosen. I understood the code, but did not comprehend the reasoning behind the code. In many cases, the logic of the pattern was not self-evident (for example read the Observer Pattern)."
4,Good place to start,"Great book, I wish that there was a little more time spent on the first two sections (Patterns and Practice) as I am already familiar with and use the tools presented in the latter chapters. If you are new to working with PHP5 in a more serious development environment and want to expand your skills beyond just creating web pages then this book is worth a look."
5,A perfect introduction to OOP in PHP5,"This book does exactly what it advertises; it gives a somewhat comprehensive introduction to concepts of object oriented development in PHP5. It's written in a simple and accessible tone yet never dumbs the subject down. It also clearly states that it offers no complete solutions, only introductions to concepts, though the book tells you where to look for more information.Coupled with a more complete design pattern catalogue and some more extensive reading on the practical aspects that are not touched on much (Phing, PEAR, CVS/SubVersion, and so on) this book is perfect for the budding PHP developer who wants to learn more than looping over a databse result or doing simple math."
3,Pretty good book,"I'm already reasonably educated on basic patterns. However, I did like this book. It was a good read. I'd highly suggest it for anyone writing PHP and needs to grasp OO development.However, I was expecting a little bit more in the ""Practice"" section of this book. I was expecting a few more real world examples to show how the author would use patterns or even Object Oriented PHP in a real world application.Since there are so few well designed OO PHP projects out there, I was hoping to see something that was specifically OO (as OO as PHP can be anyway) practice... A quick form based multi-page site would have been nice. While that may sound like a lot, it shouldn't take more than 1 chapter (about 30 pages) to show the code and briefly go over it.So, all-in-all, this book is a great tutorial on PHP OO design. What it lacked (for me anyway), was real world examples of good OO design."
3,More like Gang of Shut the Heck Up,"The first quarter of this book is an excellent primer on what's new and different in PHP5's objects; much better than the terse, incomplete, and often times grammatically broken, descriptions one finds in the free online documentation. The remaining three quarters, while generally well written when you look at individual segments, commit the most heinous of errors the author strives to warn against: repetition. It seems like every other page contains a ""Gang of Four"" reference, complete with a thorough description of who the ""Gang of Four"" are and what the ""Gang of Four"" did and all the various reasons why you should run out and buy the ""Gang of Four's"" book instead of this one. By the fourth captioned pull-quote I just wanted to strangle the editor for allowing this to go to press. Once is enough, thank you."
3,Mary the movie lover,I was expecting this movie to be a big-afro-wearin' 1960 fun time. Then reality hit with a whole lotta drama and civil rights issues; too heavy for a Saturday night. I guess the movie started out to be a very silly over-the-top flash back to the groovy 60s and took a sharp serious turn that I did not see coming. I don't think there's anything funny about what happened back then and I didn't care for the comedic start and the dead serious finish. Confused. Perhaps the movie-makers wanted to reel the audience in with all of the silly stuff and then bop 'em on the head with what really went down back in those groovy 1960s? I guess I'll watch it again and take it more seriously from the start. It's worth a look and possibly a second
3,Musicians Take Note........,"This movie looks at an interesting time in American History with great performances by the two lead actors. For me it was only a 3 star movie BUT in the last few scenes and the closing song is some of the most spectacular trumpet playing (on the soundtrack)I've ever heard by Terence Blanchard. And lots of it! I believe Blanchard who has written a lot of scores (many Spike Lee movies) did the score for this in between the song cuts selected from that time period.Blanchard's trumpet playing is all over the last part of this movie... kindof a cross between Freddie Hubbard and the late Don Ellis, using electronic effects and building climax after climax. He is amazing and I will rent this one again just for the amazing trumpet work!"
4,Very Soulful Film,"Petey Green was the truth. the real life story of a Ex Con who had a powerful voice and was a DJ in DC who made people feel where he was coming from. Don Cheadle nails the role. Cheadle is One of the Best Actors of today and He is so underrated. also Chiwetel Ejiofor does a strong job working with along side Cheadle. strong chemistry and they complimented each other. Teraji Henson with Her FIONE Self portrayed Green's Ole Lady. She was Ryde or Die with Green. Green wasn't afraid of the truth and he was always himself. spoke his mind and never backed down. the days of when a Disc Jockey was as important as the songs and the news itself. before Clear Channel and other outlets came and became a monopoly the DJ was the voice that guided your spirit and soul and lead your day from that first cup of Coffee, Kool-Aid,Water or whatever you was drinking. the DJ had the words to give that extra dip and stride in your Glide. Sho Nuff Right ON!"
1,Talk To Me,"For some reason, I just didn't find this interesting to me!!! I threw it out! Don't waste your money on this on!"
3,You knew it,They never make these movies about people who don't slip and fall. I quess that lacks drama. But an interesting history lesson for those too young to remember. the actors rise above average material.
2,Hammock chair,"It arrived fast enough, but I should have sent the chair back. It's pretty cheaply made, the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape. It's OK, but I'll keep my eyes open for a better one. And we won't swing on it. I don't think it would take it."
1,Cheaply made Chair,"Very cheaply made item. Not at all what I thought I was getting. I bought it to replace another one that broke after 4-5 years. In the item description, the first 2 pictures are what I had, the second 2 pictures are this and it is NOT THE SAME! I plan to send it back."
2,Okay for now,"Order was shipped very quickly.I will keep Item. Advertised hanging hardware and swivel not included. Chair could easily fray, cotten ends are only taped, not knotted. No way chair could be converted to 7 foot hammock as advertised. I should have read advertisement closer. I could have gotten 100% cotten chair for less. This ad didn't state the material used.I could buy from this company again I'll just pay closer attention."
4,comfortable and sturdy,"This chair is quite sturdy, and is the most desired seat on our deck! The children love it, if they can get daddy out of it!! The weave is designed to spread out the weight distribution nicely, which really makes it comfortable. If I can get some kind of neck pillow, I may never get out of it!! It is a high price for me, but I feel secure that I will not end up crashing to the ground, and that's worth it."
3,A must for your yard,"I have a large yard with a lot of trees along one side. We already had a couple of tire swings for the kids and we were looking for something comfortable for the adults. I was really excited when I saw this product. It was just what I was looking for. I found it comfortable, large and roomy, and sturdy. Usually when I sit in it, my son has to sit with me. Many nights this summer, we could be found sitting and reading in our chair."
3,"Nice, but not comfortable","Overall it is nicely made chair, but everytime when I sit in it, it made me feel like I am sitting in an airplane's economy class seat. My arm movement is very limited and my feet dangles in not so comfortable position."
2,Omni Swing not the quality as expected,"The pair of swings purchased was below the quality I expected from reading the ad. Eight months earlier I purchased a hand made one in town for the same price...as the value amount portrayed by the ad. So when the ad stated on sale for 1/2 price, I didn't expect 1/2 quality. Sorry, but I had to send mine back. I'll just stick to the local vendors."
2,Snap!!!,"I first bought this chair because it looked comforble and it was alot cheaper than the other hanging chairs I had looked at. Well I got the chair and it was pretty comfortable untill without warning, SNAP!!!!! one of the two main ropes going to the top broke. I fell flat on my [hiney] from about 4 feet in the air. This [was not fun]. I have sience put the chair away, I thought about buying some climbing rope to fix it. It should have not snapped, I don't weigh more than 175 Lbs. I would only reccomend this product to small kids."
1,Not a Good Chair,"My friend has a hammock chair from a different place that is heavenly to sit in. This hammock, however, is very uncomfortable. The strings are thin and stiff and there feels like there is no give when you sit down. I felt like I had been trapped in a fishing net the only time I ever sat in it."
2,Green Eggs & Hammocks makes a larger model,"We ordered one of these chairs thinking they were all the same - I had purchased one from Green Eggs & Hammocks in our local mall and then I saw these for a little cheaper. I highly recommend the Deluxe Chair Hammock over this one which squeezes me at the hips. The deluxe model has thicker cord, it's more durable and it's got a much longer footrest. You can order online from their website-type ""hammock"" under any search and they come up."
1,Flimsy as can be,"I wasn't expecting a top-of-the-line item here, but I was expecting better quality based on the manufacturer's description. This cake server is really quite flimsy and will probably not even hold a slice of cake. I did receive it free with purchase of a cakepan. I think I'd be quite angry if I paid even a nickel for this useless utensil."
1,Poor quality product!,"I bought this item, thinking of getting a good deal. It said stainless-steel but it came stainless steel thin like a paper. Not sure if it can handle the slice of cake. Poor quality product! Beware of this brand!"
4,Very enlightening into the lives of these wonderful men.,"Inspiring, uplifting and very interesting to look into the lives of a few of the world's greatest men. This is a great book that sheds a lot of light into why these great men were granted the ability to pass through the veil to request their work be done."
4,You mean...there's MORE?,"I bought Volumes 1, 2 and 3 some time ago, and thouht that was as far as the series went. I'm stunned - and delighted - to see there's actually NINE volumes of this series (and maybe more!). The first three volumes were outstanding, and you can bet I'm gonna grab the other ones first chance I get."
3,"I Feel Good, I Feel Bad","This song, by the Lewis and Clarke Expedition, is the only one I can find anywhere that they recorded. Travis Lewis a.k.a. Michael Martin Murphey and his buddy, Boomer Clarke, recorded under this name in the late 60's."
2,Two Generous Stars,That's for #'s 13 and 15 for good but seldom-seen tunes. The rest is so amazingly who-cares.
3,Just a few side comments,"The other reviews here treat this performance of Rheingold at length, so I jsut wanted to give my impression. The Loge of Set Svanholm and the Fricka of Kirsten Flagstad are venerable, in no way near either singer's prime. George London is an exciting, extroverted Wotan. The sonics include a lot of tape hiss, at least on my pressing, which preceded this remastering by some years. Solti's conducting can't hold a candle to the competing Karajan on DG. That Rheingold is one of the best thing in Karajan's cycle; this is the weakest link in Solti's."
4,The New World main song,"I admit I bought this album because I watched the Colin Farrell movie The New World, and the cinematography moved me so much I wanted to hear every song from the movie. Unfortunately the movie soundtrack doesn't include very much music from the movie. Track 1 is the opening scene from the movie. I wish it was ten minutes long. Its a powerful song."
5,funky and functional,"I fell in love with this pattern when it was featured in a trendy home magazine. I have been debating if I really wanted these or not. I finally got them and I'm madly in love! This is the perfect soup and cereal bowl, it is very deep and it is dish washer, microwave AND freezer safe! perfect for some who wants some trendy dish wear with out having to baby it."
2,Superfacial,"Having read several books on LaFollette, I found this one superfacial, not going much beyond contemporary news accounts. The actual climate of terror created against LaFolllete and others was not researched. Basically, I learned nothing from this book."
1,Gets a poor score under Windows Vista,"I purchased this card thinking that I would get a higher rating under Vista than my current video card since it has twice the memory and was newer. Was I ever wrong. My factory video card gets a score of 2 under Vista and worked without having to mess with drivers, this video card only received a score of 1 and I had to install the video driver in XP compatibility mode. If you're planning on buying this to support Windows Vista, don't unless the manufacturer comes up with compliant drivers and can give a score in their ratings."
2,overheating,"I made it work, but it caused overheating in my motherboard and the video quality wasn't as good as my on board video was originally. I took it out to save for a later date in another computer."
3,Not an intuitive install,"I have an older 800 MHz PC that I installed this card into. I followed the instructions that came with the card. But it took some serious afterthought and troubleshooting to figure the right sequence for the install steps. Success was achieved, and the card works great."
3,It works for me!,I don't need really high graphics as I don't go for many video games but I do appreciate decent video quality and this is a perfect economical value.
2,Weak.,Just not enough power for games released in the past year or two. I only got it because I have an older motherboard that doesn't run PCI Express. Looks like it's time for a new machine.
4,Better than expected,"Bought this to replace the 64mb onboard graphics in an Emachines computer setup as a PVR. Prior to installing this card my ATi HDTV Wonder tuner card would only work on one channel; now it works on all. Still some occasional stutter but I think it is related to my PVR software (BeyondTV 4.5). Despite what the first photo shows, this card does have a fan. The photos that show the red card are accurate. Great price if the rebate comes through."
5,Great,Video Card works great. I had a 64 MB card before this. Now games and even visualizations in media player look so much clearer. The video card is actually the red one in the picture not the black one. Great card for the money.
1,Diamond Stealth ATI 9250,"Diamond Stealth ATI 9250 PCI 256MB Video Card ( S9250PCI256 )I attempted to install device on 2 computers,Everex Explora GS28and Dell Dimension 3000.The Everex Explora GS28 computer made so much noise I just shut it down and uninstalled.And the Dell Dimension 3000,windows 7 Home Preminum accepted the card but not the drivers.All in All i had less headache with NVIDIA FX 5200,which i paid $39.99for 2yrs ago!!!!!!!"
5,Very Satisifed,"Well i read the other reviews before buying this card and i am happy to say, i am glad i ignored the negative ones.This video card is NOT the most up to date. state of the art card you can get. If you have a new computer why would you want to upgrade with an older card? Of course an older card is not going to work well with a newer computer, or the most recent games or work with newer peheripals and so fourth. Just like older equipment wont necessarily work with newer upgrades.My pc is 2.5 GHz, Dell, running XP, not a ton of memory. But this card upgraded it very nicely. The installation instructions could use a rewrite, they did not concur closely enough with my particular system. But I did not have a problem figuring it out.They probably should re-evaluate, perhaps put a warning on the box saying the card will not work efficiently with systems made after xxx date."
3,Nice songs,"Annie's songs, including ""Light of the World"", are nice songs and have potential as being really good in other artist's hands. I do have to say that Annie is a very good songwriter, and I hope that she can find some great names to sing her songs."
4,A must for avid fans of The Ventures.,"This CD is worth getting; especially for tracks 20 through 26. Not good for a beginner. The Ventures show how they shaped the 60's and all rock music with speed, loud guitars and drums.(Especially the above listed tracks). Truly the most under-rated rock band ever."
3,BEGINNINGS OF THEIR REFINED SOUND,"THERE IS A LESS THAN SMOOTH PERFORMANCE ON A NUMBER OF TRACKS, BUT THEIR STYLE DOES SHOW. TWO IN PARTICULAR THAT I HAVE PLAYED OVER AND OVER ARE STICK SHIFT, AND TOSSING AND TURNING. A NICE FIND."
2,In the vaults-should stay there,"This is the type of thing that happens when a group reaches super star status, and have a huge fan base that will buy anything available. I've been a Ventures fan since day one and I'll continue to be. The only problem is that I have just about everything I can get. I don't own some of the expensive imports, but I have everything else. This kind of release is tantalizing, because it makes people think that there's something good that's been kept from us. Not so. These songs all sound like the first run through of stuff that the group chose not to release. They are rough sounding, and sound nothing like what you're used to if you'r familiar with their body of work. Unless, like me, you have a burning desire for something new, and are curious, leave this where it belongs--in the vault."
3,Great Content but.....,"I found that the sound quality is poor. It sounds like someone had a digital recorder in the audience then dubbed it into the video. I am very disappointed. Sound was not consistant at all. I have a couple of these videos on other DVD's and its much better.For example,the song Expresions of your love you cant even hear Rebecca sing. I would pass on this one or try to borrow it first."
3,Live Performances,"My disappointment with this DVD is that nearly all of the videos present live performances. Don't get me wrong -- the music is great! But, I was looking for production videos, not glimpses of concerts. If that is not your concern, or if you prefer the concerts, then you'll find this DVD to be wonderful. The music is top notch! For my needs, there is little value. I wish the product description had warned me."
3,corelle shipment,"The set was nice and what I was looking for, but the shipment was not so good. I had bought 3 sets and there was a broken mug in one of the boxes and on two of the plates there were small chips off the design. Instead of having the hassle of returning I kept the sets and asked for some of my money back. The person I spoke to in Customer Service was very cooperative and did not give me a hard time."
5,perfect,shipped promptly! was a christmas gift and she loves it! gorgeous! the detail is amazing. just as pictured and seller described! great item! love it!
3,Water Music played much too fast.,"Sorry everyone. This is not the consumate Water Music for me. The tempo throughout is usually much too fast and robs the music of its delicate emotion. Rapid, excessive trills and the overwhelming brilliance of each and every note do not create a pleasant performance. Water Music can be serene and reflecting too. From the very beginning the mood here is almost arrogant. Maybe a listener who values techinical perfection more than emotional sincerity will get more out of this recording than I did."
5,Review for Handel: water music/music for the royal fireworks,"I got this because it reminded me of my trip to Paris. I remember hearing the Alchemyst while wandering around the gardens of Versailles. I'm not familiar with other recordings of Handel's Water Music, so I'm not sure how this recording compares to them. However, I do think this is a decent performance, and you get lots of songs for ~$10. A problem I have with some recordings is that they are too quiet, and I have to crank up the volume on my mp3 player. Then it'll go to the next song from a different album that was recorded at normal volume and my ears will hurt if I don't adjust the volume in time. I liked that I did not have that problem with this recording."
2,"Nice Accurate Pictures, but not a Detailed History","This book was very different than I expected because I was looking for a good detailed history about all the major airlines, which this book was not. The history section was only about 2 pages long and the rest of the book was filled with pictures with detailed and accurate captions about the type of plane in the picture. This book left something to be desired for me."
4,Bad Attitude embodied! :)),"I'm not at all your average collector of action figures, especially from the WWE (since I don't watch such matches anyway, save once in a very blue moon and only for a few minutes in surfing). Those figures I collect are inspiration for my own speculative fiction writing, including this figure.That said: Mark Henry must be one BIG dude (like the others in the various figure series), if the figure of him is 1 inch = 1 foot. That would make him almost 7 feet tall and over 300 pounds. And the artist who sculpted his face captured his BAD ATTITUDE perfectly (that scowl could stun an ox at an eighth of a mile, let me tell you). This figure seems a little less durable than some in the series, and less flexible in the joints, but he's still all menace just like the rest of them."
3,Not granite,"This is not real granite, so the item description is somewhat misleading. It's lightweight plastic. It does the job but is not a high quality product that you might expect. I'm from the UK and so was expecting something like the Tesco Finest Worktop Saver which is a similar price there and is real granite. This is black granite colored plastic. I wanted this to make a turntable stand (look up granite seismic sink worktop saver on Google). It works, but it's not great...."
3,Okay but not fabulous,"Lightweight, looks nice out in the kitchen. I like it okay, but am not dazzled."
2,THIS IS NOT A GRANITE BOARD!,"This is a poly board colored granite. It is sealed and very nice but it is not granite. We did keep it and it is a nice cutting board, but it is not for pastry or working dough as it does not cool down and keep cool like a marble board would."
1,Don't buy this poorly named product,"As Twain said, ""The difference between the right word and almost the right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug."" This is a lightning bug. I was ordering a bunch of presents for Christmas, and mistakenly picked up this mis-named ""Granite Pastry Board,"" which is as much like granite as my stomach muscles are like steel. What a disappointment. It may be a fine cutting board, but it is some type of plastic that is not at all what I thought I was buying. This kind of cheesy marketing really cheeses me off."
3,Fine for now,"This cutting board seemed to be fine until my husband pointed out that the plastic was so rough on the surface that food stuck to it when you wiped it off. It washes better under the fawcett. I like the size. We had a large marble cutting stone previously that broke after 20 years, so it may be that we just need to get used to the rough plastic. Like other people have said it does show the cut groves from use. I will use it for a while but it won't last 20 years like the last cutting board. It was priced at about what it is worth....lol"
3,composition not what expected,i don't know if i diddn't read the description thourghly but it just wasn't what i expected. i thought the surface would be harder.
4,Very pleased,"I'm very pleased with this cutting board - it is functional and washes well. I leave it sitting on my counter at all times because it's also attractive. The 'Granite' used in the product description is simply referring to the color and look of the board, not the material it's made from. It clearly states in the description that it's constructed of plastic material. A great board for a great price!"
3,so so -,the board looks like I wanted it to - but does show cut marks and doesn't sit flat on the counter -
4,Wedding Favorite,"I recieved this cutting board as a wedding gift. It's strong enough to beat pork chops in to tenderloins, yet light enough to toss in the dishwasher. I love it!"
3,good,"W.H.D. Rouse's prose translation of The Odyssey takes too many liberties, especially for a prose translation. One needs only to look at the beginning of book 1: where is the invocation to the muse? Rouse's idea of the Greek language available to Homer was that it was more varied than it was. Also, in remembering this epic, the storyteller had to use many stock phrases, as it is such a long book. Rouse does not seem to understand this."
5,Richard or Richmond?,"Is it possible that HarperCollins has misprinted the cover, changing the first name of the translator?"
3,CORRECTION to review I wrote about Lattimore's bad trans.,"HI: i can't find out from Help how to edit the prior review I wrote explaining that because I found Lattimore's translations of the Gospels&Revelation inaccurate, I wondered how good His Homer could be. So, consider this the correction. The prior review was way too strongly-worded. I meant what I said, but it wasn't as soft as it should have been.No one is perfect, and there is YET no good English translation of the New Testament, so why should Lattimore be expected to get right what NO one has ever gotten right? So, please bear this thought in mind as you see me lambast Lattimore in my other review, which has the words ""ek koilia"" in it (vocabulary form).I heartily apologize for the other review's tone!"
3,Did Lattimore translate Homer as badly as he did Gospels?,"I'll have to get the book to find out, I guess. I found several of his Gospel renderings inexcusable, suffering from the same idiocy as 1st-year seminary students (i.e., translating ek koilia as ""in the womb"", when it only and always means ""out from the womb"" as any 1st-year text can prove). I didn't see him render ANY of the Atticisms in Gospels as Atticisms, for another example. So, I'm skeptical.Then again, with Homer he's not got the same politically-correct strictures. Will have to see..."
4,The best sequel in history?,"If you are trying to plough through the Canon, then this book is the next stop after the Iliad. And what a stop it is! Although I think that the Iliad is a better read, the Odyssey is an excellent sequel and a very good story too. Want to know whether Odysseus returned from Troy, and how? Want to know which other heroes made it? Want to catch up with a few of them, dead or alive, on the way? If so then this is the book for you.Lattimore's translation is excellent and highly recommended. Anyone who enjoyed his Iliad will find the same brilliance at work here."
4,Odysseus Sails and Makes it Home,"Easy to read, clear, has glossary, each page marked by events described in the epic poem on that page.Could not find this translation, which I needed to teach a class, in two other places I looked but found it through Amazon. Frankly, Robert Fagles' translation is better, more poetic and striking, but this translation (Latimore) is very impressive. Clear and good for first-time readers."
4,Homer's Odyssey,Great translation. Engaging and vital images that are easy to relate to. Recommend it to scholars and the public wanting to understand classical culture.
4,the poet,I never imagined Homer was such a wonderful poet! A great pleasure to read (the Iliad and) the Odyssey. Althoug cruelty was as common then as today.
2,Not a very helpfull Manual,"I bought the manual thinking it will assit me with my repairs on my Mercedes Diesels but I find the manual very general. Try to find out something about the Vacuum door lock system....Nothing or what the kick down Transmission solenoid does or located etc. NG.Not pleased with this product at all, there is probably another manual that is more specific and helpful."
2,OK if you don't need to know anything in depth.,"It doesn't even mention rear wheel bearings. Chilton editors/mechanics/engineers, am I wrong? Is it really there and I just missed it?"
2,Don't get your hopes up,"This book is not all that bad. This is better than the Haynes manual any day. Its problem is that it is too vague. The only things it covers are the basic mechanical aspects. If you are having problems with say the vacuum system for the door locks on a 79 450sl, there is nothing. They lead you to believe that they have complete vacuum diagrams. In fact, most of the vacuum system is NOT covered."
1,Very General Book - Few Specifics,"AsI suspected whenI bought this book, it covers too many models and is far too thin on the ground. It is little better than a general maintenance book. In contrast to the Robert Bentley manuals which are 5 star+, I found this book to be of almost no practical value."
2,HELLLP MEEE!,I have a 86' 300 SDL Turbo Diesel 6cyl. I need to replace the timing chain and find top dead center. I need an original manual or repair maual for this car. If anyone can help i am at carminecovellojr@hotmail.com.this book is not thorough for diesels.
1,If you have a diesel - don't buy,"I have an older edition. It doesn't cover the diesel fuel system. At all. Injectors, injection pump,lift pump, filters, tank. Nothing."
2,Poor CD Quality,"I should have read the reviews first! The people that complained about poor CD quality were dead on. The first CD's recording level is very low. My system can barely amplify it. The second CD is fine. I give Pavarotti 5 stars, but only two on my review overall due to volume issues...Pete"
3,Great Music......Horrible Mastering,"Pavarotti has a voice that can take hold of you and change your entire mood...even if you don't know Italian. The problem with this set is the mastering (mastering evens out the volumes and signal to noise ratio on an album). The first CD in this collection is so quiet that you literally have to crank your player to get any kind of volume. For a professional CD this is absolutely unacceptable.The song choices are good with the exception of ""My Way"" with Frank Sinatra. Both singers sound ....ummm...let's just say less than their best on the recording. It sits out like a boil on a pretty girl's face."
4,Stellar John Jackson Record,"This is a stellar John Jackson record, and also the last record which the man recorded. Though his hands weren't as quick as they were on albums he recorded in the 1970s, the choice of material on this album is very interesting, as is evident by the presence of ""Devil He Wore A Hickory Shoe"" and ""West Texas Blues"". This is a highly enjoyable album, but should not serve as one's introduction to John Jackson."
5,Great Product,"This is by far the best soap my face has ever been exposed to. I highly recommend this and only Olivella, no substitutes."
1,NG,"I buy the bar soap its much better. This stuff I bought to put on a scrubber sponge, it dont lather up good. I guess it would be ok next to the sink to wash your hands. Bought it for travel. not a good idea."
1,Olivella order comment,"I originally bought this product on sale while out of town. When I reached the bottom of the bottle, it was time to order one from Amazon. While I have never used it as a body soap, it is a wonderful product for the face. The dispenser top is perfect for dispensing the small amount desired for washing. It rinses off beautifully. And because of the size, it lasts for a very long time."
5,the next best thing to being there,Italian olive oil is a decadent pleasure. This lovely soap has all the wonderful emolient qualities of that wonderful olive oil. The description of the product neglected to mention if this soap was scented. I'm delighted to say that it is. I'm not sure what the scent is from but it is lovely. A great soap for showering. Worth the price!
2,Not my thing,"I have used olive oil bar soap for years. I wanted to try this liquid soap because it's less messy. Unfortunately, ""You can't have your cake and eat it too."" Olive oil bar soap is nothing but olive oil and a bit of fragrance. This liquid is full of chemicals including heavy, artificial fragrance. If you want pure, this isn't it. Stick with the bars."
2,Frangrance is too strong,I tried this as a replacement for my soap in the shower. The smell is overwhelming and it doesn't suds up well in the shower. I did not notice a difference after the shower with my skin. Felt the same as if I had used regular bar soap with strong lingering smell.
2,Too strong,"I ordered this set expecting a mild soap that could be used on face and body. I wasn't expecting the very strongly scented soap, akin to Irish Spring or other bar soaps. I certainly wasn't going to use this on my face. So I put the bottles in the shower. My husband seems to like it, and the soap does seem to have a smooth texture and lathers nicely. But the bathroom smells of this for a long time afterwards. It's a clean smell, I suppose, but very strong."
2,Size is nice but info lacks a great deal,"For a first time visitor this guide could be useful but please don't rely on it alone. The maps are decent but they leave out much of the city, not even covering all of Manhattan -- much less the outer boros. The section on Greenwich Village is appalling - with repeated recommendations for Marc Jacobs stores and other corporate entities that have destroyed the historic and cultural values of that neighborhood. I have a feeling that the many of the entries in this guide were paid for rather than selected for their innate interest/value - but I could be wrong."
4,Very Usefull,"I took this map book and no other on a one week trip to NYC. Before I went I wrote all kinds of things in it that I wanted to make sure that I did not miss. It worked perfect for portability, but once there, found there were some streets missing. Mainly in downtown. But I worked it out and about wore this little book out!"
3,Disappointed with quality.,I used this yarn to knit a scarf for a friend for Christmas. I was disappointed with the quality of the yarn as some of the sections of the fun fur were unraveled from the yarn with the puffs and some of the fun fur yarn was broken. But I was able to connect them and finish the project.
3,Filling in the blanks for a glorious Ring,"I have nothing to add to the disappointed reviews of this Walkure, which is only at its best in Act 2 (the one that most opera-goers sleep through!) But I wanted to pass on the ideal Ring cycle I've assembled, one that brings me great pleasure. It's a 2 plus 2 affair:From Karajan: a magnificent Rheingold and Walkure.From Solti: a magnificent Siegfried and Gotterdammerung.The two Karajan installments have no flaws to my ears, except perhaps the eccentric casting of Fischer-Dieskau as a baritone (!) Wotan, but he brings great musical rewards nonetheless. The Solti installments have two flaws--his sometimes brutal conucting and the aging Windgassen as a surrogate Heldentenor for want of a real one. But it is remarkable to think that no one over the last forty years has produced serious rivals to any of these sets. Thank God we have them, warts and all."
1,Fox Urine,"Squirels are nesting in the attic and a fox urine product used previously worked. This product, Red Fox Urine did not do the job."
1,Product never worked,This product never worked for me These geese lookat me put the product down went over a smelt it nibbled at it and still stayed that day and have been comjing back every since I would ask for a full refund includinhg shipping. If this company stands by this produc.
3,This is not the complete cure for wild critter problems,We have flying squirrels in our attic and have been determined to remove them in a humane way. The red fox urine is very potent and clearly the flying squirrels did not like it but it did not stop them from continuing to camp out in our attic. The best remedy has been to use a trap. The flying squirrels love apple with peanut butter and we've been able to lure them into the trap with this and then relocate them. So far this year we've been able to relocate 5 flying squirrels with this method.
2,Don't Tamper with the Food Chain,"Problem: Groundhogs. Solution: Deceptively trick them into believing that the crawlspace under your deck is actually an overutilzed fox urinal. New Problem: Bobcats looking for foxes. Now we've got wildcats clawing and growling under our grill and deck furniture as they await the return of these apparently urine-bloated foxes (and our little brichon frise dog Gaston-Rene is long gone). A guy at the university says that I need to do some ""excrement-compounding"" which involves layering my fox urine with cougar urine and then with cougar-carcass essence. We don't see the results of this yet vis-a-vis the foxes, but the flies are out of control. Thank goodness for our noses, these can be addressed with a giant poster of a frog and a running digital recording of two bats mating."
2,Good Writing but Stereotypical Characters,"I purchased this book because the plot sounded very good and the reviews were great. But, from a Black perspective as soon as I began reading Seminole Song, I could tell that Ms. Munn was of European descent before finding out who she was. The heroine in the book, Calida, although a slave, had to have European features to be beautiful, especially almost straight hair. Becuase in order for Panther and Gaitor ""the Negro"" to fall in love with her, of course she couldn't have any traces of African features; even if she was supposed to be a person of mixed ancestry. Although this is a well written book in terms of imagery and historical authenticity, the stereotypes that leaped out at me are too numerous for me to type. Hence the two star rating."
3,Great service,I bought these games for a Christmas gift. I don't plan on playing them. But delivery was prompt.
2,Bach Contata BWV 78#2,"I fully agree with the first reviewer who heard a version of this contata on public radio, and then bougght the Rifkin one from Amazon. I too bought it, and was disappointed. I would love to know who recorded the version we both heard on Public Radio. Cant seem to find it."
5,Inspirational!,"I had the tape and was no longer able to play it, the cd is fantastic, much better quality to listen to!"
3,girls sneakers,my daughter loves her sneakers - my downfall is the top of the toe area marks up quickly - is there a way to protect this area better?
4,Not a bad product at all.,For the price the item was a good purchase. I see no reason to spend more money on an stethoscope when you can find one that works just as well as the others for a better price.
1,Ouch! It Hurts!,"This stethoscope was bought for my 6 year old granddaughter. I was not expecting high quality, but expected it to be fun to use. The ear tightness and angle was so bad that she could not use it at all. Her father tried it on and stated that it was completely unusable even for him and he could not adjust it. What a waste and what a disappointment!! Don't they (Omron) quality check their products for usability?"
2,"Great toy, but a little confusing on how it works","Gave this to my son (3.5yrs) for Christmas. The helicopter seems to work fine, but one of the blades seemed to break the first day and the trigger did not spin the blades like it once did. Mine may just be the exception, but it really required almost breaking the blades to re-align and it worked again. My first review rated it low for this and I've modified it, but cannot seem to change the rating stars. O well. Great toy."
4,Amazing toy for a little boy!,"Our two year old loves his Helicopter! After owning it for five months here is what we think:Pros:- Has provided hours of pretend flying, the cool realistic helicopter sound is an added bonus!- It is extremely durable - our son is not easy on toys and this has had it's fair share of abuse.- My husband enjoys playing with it.- The price of the toy - unbelievable for the amount of time he has spent actually playing with it.- Our son has had no issues using any of the buttons on the toy, Mater comes out with every push of the button.- A great gift for any child 2-5!Con:- The only con is the rubber band - or device which moved the blades to spin quit working or fell off, although the sound is still there. Might not be a bad thing considering the two year old is the operator."
2,"Fun for about 3 minutes, then the blades broke off. ::: sigh :::","My son is a major Cars collector. We bought this for him and he was delighted with it and then the blades snapped off and neither he nor we could get them back on properly. They go back on, but they won't seat properly so, you can't make the blades spin with the trigger. He still likes his helecopter, but I was annoyed that we had spent so much on a toy that popped apart in 3 minutes. Oh well. It's still a part of his beloved collection."
5,Wow.,"Simply said, these are fantastic compositions that are fabulously conducted. Ashkenazy has a way with Rachmaninoff. Second disc is my favorite.Buy these, put it into your speakers, turn up the volume, and let three discs of symphonic bliss wash over you."
3,Competent Performances! Good Sound Quality!,"I guess I should have known that with only 3 cds in this set that there would have been little chance of this coming in a cardboard box set like the other very well packaged Decca product the Shostakovich String Quartets but instead we get the Rachmaninov symphonies, ""The Bells"", ""Symphonic Dances"" and ""The Isle of the Dead"" in a jewel case which I personally hate.Packaging aside, there is not faulting the content which is very well performed by Concertgebouw and Ashkenazy. The sound quality in DDD format is also good but not the best that I've heard admittedly.All in all, I do wish Amazon will provide more specific product descriptions in the future but I guess until then we will have to rely on the kindness of reviewers."
5,The ultimate Guide to the Perfect Word: Quotes-Titles-Poetry-Tips-Words,AWESOME book!!!! I will use this until it falls apart. Loaded with tons of great quotes etc. Perfect for my scrapbook pages. This is a must have product!!!!
5,A Must Have for Scrapbookers,Love this book. I keep it handy for all my creativity blocks. I shared it with a friend who loved it so much she's getting one too. Use it just once and it will have paid for itself. Well organized and covers all the topics.
5,Scrapbooking must have,"no matter if you scrapbook, or make cards this book is a must have use it all the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,GREAT REFERENCE TOOL,"Really like the layout of this little reference book. It can be used quoting word for word, changing certain words to fit your need, or triggers something in your own mind using your own words! Not only do I use it for scrapbooking, but also for short personal notes on greeting cards, or my personal journaling."
5,A must-have!,"This book is a must-have for serious scrapbookers who are always on the search for page titles. I have owned this book for over a year, and I have used it for inspiration dozens of times. Even if it doesn't have the ""perfect words"" for my page, I can usually tweak the ideas to make them perfect. Definitely worth the buy."
3,Ultimate Guide to the perfect Word,"I was a little disappointed in this book. Was expecting more; sorta like short poems, short little stories, etc. Maybe I'll buy another kind and get the things I want out of it."
4,card making,I am always looking for the right message to touch the heart. I have it within my reach.
2,Pretty Bad,"I'm sorry, but I thought this book was bad. Approaching awful. The premise was interesting enough--a boy's sister goes missing, and it (as it always does) affects his family. But the truth is that the whole thing--plot, dialogue, character--was tedious. All of it.The family made assumption based on nothing, and although the grief they were going through seemed true and thought-out, in the end it became a simple game of repetition and whininess. And though I wasn't going in expecting the book to end all happily ever after, I WAS wanting at least the tiniest bit of it to be resolved; but no. The book ended abrubtly and with questions unanswered.In the end: two stars. It was bad, but the concept was good and the sadness was portrayed well enough."
4,good product,it arrives in the right time and in perfect condition. the book is excellent.No complain at all.was a good buy.
4,Psychology for Living,"This book does a very good job of remaining humanistic; in that the authors believe that it is within the ability of all human beings to choose to improve themselves, and makes a lot of room for the variability of human preferences and styles. Each chapter contains a self-assessment questionaire that is fun and enlightening, which will give rise to the reader's perspectives and life experience. In contrast to most Adjustment Textbooks, this one is more applicable to real life than most. It minimized psychological theory, and maximized application to your own life!"
2,Read carefully,"The material is OK, but there are many editing errors; missing words and typographical errors."
3,... NOT THAT BAD AT ALL,"After seeing previews, trailers and cheesy commercials for ""Get Over It!"", I thought this was going to be another cheesy attempt to make a few bucks off of us teens. I was right... but the movie did turn out to be pretty good. Trust me, it could have been a heck of a lot worse. Kirsten Dunst gives off great screen presence and Martin Short steals the show as an overly dramatic Theatre teacher. Kirsten was simply beautiful and she had me swooning when she was singing for the school play. (Not to mention the great scene of her in a bikini at the pool. Ouch). Worth watching at least once."
3,"IF IN MOOD FOR SOME ""MINDLESS FUN,"" THIS WILL DO.","I feel foolish renting this movie. I'll admit that I saw a picture somewhere of Kirsten Dunst and Mila Kunis in bikinis, and although that brief part near the beginning was quite enjoyable, the movie never gets more interesting. Yeah, I like Kirsten like most people, and I found most of the actors good enough. Still, why is it that when you see a modern teenage comedy, you have to leave your brain someplace else?Berke (dorky name, dude) is dumped by his girlfriend, who is nicely played by Melissa Sagemilleru, and since he was friends with her since childhood, the pain caused by the separation is justified. Where I had trouble is that there was any chance that Berke would be so lucky to have a young, beautiful woman like the character played by Kirsten Dunst look at him! He's an average high-school guy; she's a Goddess. Anyway, predictable events continue, yada, yada, yada..."
2,Falls Short of Its Potential,"Get Over It is a high school flick that could have been so much better than it turned out to be. The cast is obviously talented, and the premise, while scarcely being new, could have worked. Berke has just been dumped by his girlfriend, and as he leaves her house, a hilarious musical number starts, slowly building behind him. After that, I expected great things from this movie, but it dragged on and on .... The Midsummer Night's Dream interludes were about the only thing that kept me awake. The ending -- which showed the performance of the musical remake of Shakespeare's classic -- was brilliant. I found myself wishing that the entire movie had been mostly a musical, and generally I'm not a big musical fan."
4,Very Entertaining,"I thought this movie was going to be garbage, but it was actually quite entertaining. I laughed quite a bit. Sisquo wasn't too bad. His character was somewhat goofy. Kirsten Dunst has a really nice singing voice...I think that was her voice.Cool Movie...Very Entertaining."
4,Kirsten Dunst rocks it like a hurricane,"Yeah, I agree with some of the stuff I've read that says Ben Foster may not have been the most ideal guy to play the lead in this movie, but with solid performances by Kirsten Dunst, Martin Short, and the majority of the cast, this quirky, teen romance isn't as bad as some people are making it out to be. The DVD features some cool extras and there were several times during the movie I found myself laughing out loud. Also, you get to hear Kirsten sing a couple of songs too, so, hey, it can't be that bad. If you like Kirsten Dunst or are looking for a good teen date-type movie, give Get Over It a try."
5,Get Over It,"The movie is about this guy named Berk. He and this girl named Allison are boyfriend and girlfriend.....That is untill Allison realizes she doesn't like him anymore, and they break up. Then Allison goes out with the brittish singer guy who she thinks is all that. To get back at her Berk goes and joins the play that Allison and the brittish dude are in. Since Berk doesn't know anything about the creator of the play, William Shakespear, he askes for the help if his best friend's sister, Kelly, who is also in the play and knows almost everything to know about Shakespear. During the time that Kelly helps Berk she falls for him. Berk doesn't even realize it because he blinded by trying to get Allison to go back out with him. Well for the rest of the movie you'll have to see it for yourself."
3,Oddly charming,"While there are moments where this film gets bogged down in the traditional teen comedy pitfalls- gross-out humor and over-the-top sexual antics - it really is very clever and funny. Martin Short's name-dropping, weirdo drama coach reminds me of waaay too many people I knew in college. Shane West's take on an accent-faking recovering boy band member is hilarious. And, Lord help me, I even liked some of the musical numbers. Some of them.I don't know if I'd let my tweenage daughter watch it, but it's certainly safer than ""American Pie"" or ""Scary Movie."""
5,A Classic Romantic Comedy!,"Berke Lander's (Ben Foster) world is shattered when his high school sweetie dumps him for the school hunk. To mend his broken heart, he joins the school production of ""A Midsummer's Night's Dream,"" which stars his ex, her new bf ad his best bud's younger, ""surprisingly grown up"" sis Kelly (Kirsten Dunst), leaving the audience pondering the burning question: Who's gonna hook up with whom by opening night?"
2,And I rented that because...???,"Ok. I can appreciate a good laugh, but there's just nothing to laugh at in this movie. It was...weak, for lack of a better word. I guess I expected ""10 thing I hate About You"" quality. Don't buy. If you insist, then rent first!"
2,HORRIBLE!,"I did not like this movie!This is not KIRSTEN DUNST AT HER BEST.THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY AT SOME POINTS AND KIRSTEN DUNST WAS IN IT.IF YOU WANT A GOOD KIRSTEN DUNST MOVIE,TRY DICK."
1,get over it,"really, really bad movie, i do not recomend seeing it, let alone buying it! a complete waste of money and time"
4,"Sweet, Cute, Silly Movie...","This was a Good Movie... I watch it often, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie... ""Berke"" is somewhat irritating.... he barely moves his mouth when he talks... and the ""Big Red"" scene is painful to watch. Alison isn't all that great... but anyway.... The Best Part of this movie, and what keeps me watching it over and over is.... The remake of ""September"" at the very end... I LOVE IT!!!! SiSQO & Vitamin C do a fabulous job... It's better than the original 70's something disco song! Not to mention a pleasant surprise when Kirsten sings.. she can sing .... very lovely.I want the song ""SEPTEMBER"" (not the EARTH WIND & FIRE version) on CD... so I can listen to it in my car.... WHY isn't it on the Sound Track!??!?!?!?!?!?!? boohoo! How can I get it? Anyone know? Help?!"
4,"Another teen movie, but it is still so hilarious","This movie was very funny. Martin Short acted out hilarious antics in this movie. You will be laughing throughout this movie. From the slightly crazed theater teacher, who is obsessed with his ""fame"" that he always wanted, to the extremely open parents. The movie centers around a teenager (Ben Foster) and all of his love problems that he keeps encountering. He just can't decide who he wants until the movie nears it's end. It is another teen movie, which I don't often like, but this one was special. Kirsten Dunst is concreting her acting career, and has become a great actress, being able to show emotion and great acting. I think this is a good movie to watch anytime, anywhere, for almost anybody."
4,Suprisingly Entertaining,"I work at a library and I am the resident movie buff. So I often get recruted to take home new movies so I can advise people whether or not they are worth their time. I was very suprised with how enjoyable this movie is. It's not as a typical teen comedy as I thought it was going to be. The acting was very good, this is one of my favorite performances by Martin Short, and the flow is nice, too. Even the songs in it are highly entertaining. Maybe the best part was watching pop superstar Sisqo ask like a goofball for most of the movie. I'll definatly recommend this movie to patrons looking for a light, fun comedy."
1,Get Past It,"I have no doubt that Kirsten Dunst can carry a movie. I have no doubt that Colin Hanks will become a star. I have no doubt that a movie featuring Sisquo could be fun. I have no doubt that you should pass on this film, even if you are just renting it. Yeah, Kirsten does look hot in this film (as does Kylie Bax and Carmen Electra), but that does not make up for the void left by their male counterparts. Sisquo and Colin Hanks try (while ""leading man"" Ben Foster does not even register) but they can't get out from under this junk. Not even the manic presence of Martin Short as a flamboyant high school drama teacher helps. Seriously, the 1 star is because of how good the women look, and that's it. The Sisquo video during the credits shows 1000 times more bounce, fun, pop than the entire film!"
3,Get Over It,"Sometimes you just need a movie that has no clear value. The story of a student body doing a stage show of Shakespeare probably has been done before, but this show has funny spots, schoolboy/schoolgirl crushes, and all the work of putting together a respectable show. Martin Short really outdoes himself as the director of the show, with grandoise dreams that spiral down to the idea that this show might not work out, thereby damaging forever his reputation. With a few changes by the students, the show really comes together with some funny lines and a beautiful song. Good cast: Martin Short, Kirsten Dunst, Ben Foster, Colin Hanks, Ed Begley, Jr., and Swoosie Kurtz, to mention a few! Just a fluffy film!"
3,(3.5 stars) A Decent Teen Movie,"Get Over It is a cute, yet fairly predictable, teen movie. The good cast helps make it different from the other teen movies. What it lacked in plot originality, it make up for in the look and feel of the movie. I think it would have been a better movie if it had been from Kirsten Dunst's (who shined brighter than any of the others) point of view, instead of Ben Foster's, though good in his role too. Still, if you are looking for a cute, fun, mindless movie to watch, this is a good one to pick. If only to see the costumes, set, the performance of Kirsten Dunst (and her singing!) and Vitamin C at the end. 3.75/5 stars"
4,Good price,"Little awkward appearance, but good material and big! Good for a coin bank that's somewhat cute at the same time!"
3,Fun way to save,I bought this bank for a Christmas gift for my daughter in law to-be who is from Hawai'i. I started her saving for her next visit to see her parents with some seed money in the bank. I suggested that their spare change go in to the bank every night.
4,Good but not excellent,"I bought this disc in order to have all the great wind serenades (K388, K375 and K361) in a single set and (of course) for the reputation of the London Wind Soloist (A.Civil, for example, is wonderful as usual, especially in the divertimenti). Unfortunately, these recordings don't satisfy me at all; even if the interpretation could be good, the sound is quite sharp and bad balanced (the oboes are too close and I don't like the clarinets sound), and, finally, there are some technical imperfections. I suggest the Holliger Wind Ensemble (Hermann Baumann, Eduard Brunner, Heinz Holliger, Louise Pellerin, Elmar Schmid, Klaus Thunemann, Radovan Vlatkovic, Matthew Wilkie) for a very good recording of the K388 and K375 serenades. Anyway, this set is ""not bad despite the flaws"" as said by another reviewer and the price could be a real advantage."
3,Average Musicianship,"I found that, though the players' technique was sound, the blending of the parts and the intonation, especially, should have been better. They sounded like they were playing period instruments. Whether or not they were, was not given in the notes. Anyway, they lacked a sonority and tonal purity which is present in better recordings. Notably, the B flat serenade was a little raw sounding, missing the unadulterated sound which Mozart demands of his winds. Just look at the recording by Academy of St.Martin in the Fields for the soundtrack to the film, Amadeus. The adagio movement was far superior. To sum up, unless you find a more reputable ensemble's recording of these works, it is still a good investment for a classical collection."
2,Was that an oboe or a goose?,"Nice performances by the other players, but the net effect is a warmly balanced wind section ruined by oboes on cheap instruments. After listening for a while I got a headace from their shrill nasality. And as a general rule, ensembles should be supported from the bottom. The heavy oboe hand created a top heavy effect.It's nice to have all these works in one complete set, but I would look for oher recordings if I had it to do over again.But if you want to discourage your kids from playing oboe, get this set."
4,Best Stealth Kit Available...,"Even though this kit isn't 100% accurate, it's much better (IMHO) than the Academy kit, which is more expensive. This kit is about as easy as they come and make a good representation of the first aircraft to fully incorporate stealth technology (if you don't count the SR-71). For the price, you can't beat this kit and it's nice that they made the new gray scheme an option."
4,Still the Best!,"I own three versions of this recording and by far, this one's my favorite. Although the 1985 digital sound quality is not top notch, Hogwood's stunning performance surely is! The authentic instruments give the music a live quality that you don't always hear in Baroque music, and you can't beat two CD's for the price of one. Now I want to investigate much more of Hogwood's Academy of Ancient Music!"
4,This version is for original instrument enthusiasts,"Many of the paces are faster than usual and the use of period horns and trumpets creates a distinctively different sound than you'll get with conventional recordings. The Academy of Ancient Music produces really good authentic performances but it should be noted, that Bach would've used the best instruments he would have got his hands on for performing his stuff.If you plan on getting one version of the Brandenberg Concertos, this is not the one I would recommend. However, if you are a real lover of Bach and are curious as to how his music might have sounded in the 1720's, this is an excellent addition to your music collection.I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com"
4,excellent performance a different view,"this is an interesting performance of the concertoes.although the tempo may be a little fast at times and though i prefer the expanded harpsichord version of the fifth concerto, i still recommend this recording in that it brings out the baroque qualities of these works in ways that other recording never do. the part playing is very fine, partially due to the recording process... highly recommended to those who already own a good conventional recording of the work"
2,Would have been the best but ...,"I always enjoyed the chamber intimacy Hogwood gave to his players in this recording. Wonderfull interpretations. But it is a pity CH chose the original versions: N 1 lacks the 3 movement and the ""polacca"" section of the 4 movement. The harpsichord solo in the 1st movement of the fifth is severerly shortened (more exactly, Bach expanded a section that was crying for a more extended part). To sum up, you know Bach was a perfectionist. Each thing he revisited, he improved. And he decided to give to Brandenburg Margrave a present, an improved version of his best concerti (in Pickett opinion, it was a kind of allegory). So please don't waste your money in preliminary versions in your first set of brandenburgs. I hope CH make a new recording, one player to a part."
2,This album is misleading,"I was somewhat annoyed to find, after opening and listening to this album, that there are some noticable differences from the traditional versions of the Brandenburg concertos. I'm no classical music expert, but even I could hear the changes! After reading the liner notes, I discovered that this version uses variant texts of the concertos that C. Hogwood or whoever thinks are more authentic. That's very nice if you're a student of all the minor variations in Bach's work, but I just wanted to hear the standard Brandenburg concertos that I love. It was very misleading that the changes are not disclosed anywhere on the outside of the CD or on Amazon.com's description of it."
3,Vale a pena!,"(Portuguese-BRASIL)Esse cd é uma boa oportunidade para conhecer um pouco mais sobre essa dupla, que eu ñ sabia que fosse to antiga..."
4,Solid Reference Work for the OT reader,"Alexander brings a usable piece of scholarship to the world of academia with this book. It is a step above entry level texts on the Pentateuch, and is a good read. This book will help you figure out the themes in the beginning of the Old Testament, and point you in the direction of deeper sources for themes that you want to dig deeper into. I view this book as fairly progressive, not overly conservative and certainly not liberal scholarship. So, depending on what school of thought you are from, this book falls somewhere in the middle, which I appreciate.Joseph Dworak"
4,keep your eyes open,"Overall I would say this book is well written and well organized. However, we used this book as a text in one of my college courses and several of the ""higher ups"" including my professor were able to point out several fallacies. It seemed that he stuck with structure so much that he stretched the text at times. Good informational book, but read with your Scriptural eyes open."
4,I like it!,"I bought this cd a while ago. The reason I bought it is because Barbara Bonney is my favourite artist. I think she sings beautifully in this cd. But for the repetoire, I think it's a litte bit too contemparory for me and I am not really into that. Still, I think she did an excellent job in this recording! It's really worth buying!"
4,"""Warlords of the 21st century"" OR ""Battletruck""","Futuristic,action,betrayal,possessive,simplicity,romance; you can find all of this in this movie ."
4,Ah a classic,"Also known as simply ""battletruck"" it shows all of the qualities of a great cult classic - so sit back and enjoy."
3,More Artist Than Art,"Jencks gives us a well-researched biography of Le Corbusier, but unfortunately he does not give the reader enough on Le Corbusier's art. While the insights into Le Corbusier's life are intriguing, we are only given a cursory look at his buildings and paintings themselves with little analysis beyond the typical Jencks ""multivalence"" routine. It is an excellent biography, but I was shopping more for a detailed look at Le Corbusier's work itself so I was a bit disappointed in the end."
2,"it is not, in fact, for most ""focused beginners""","First I want to clarify that if you're actually a serious experienced wine maker and want to learn all the ins and outs of perfecting the wines you hand crushed from your private orchard then this is in fact a good book. My beef is that it claims to be for ""focused beginners"" and it is way too advanced for that.I was already quite familiar with the similar process of beer brewing so I had a leg up on most people but I still had to read through advanced processes and a sea of chemical terminology hoping they'd be defined and make sense later.What makes this book poor for newcomers is that it tends to dive straight into specifics without taking a step back and explaining basics like what is going on or why.What you can expect from this book is more of a reference manual of tips and tricks for perfecting your processes - not book that broadens your general understanding or appreciation of wine."
1,Typical Roger Corman fare.,"With Roger Corman's name attached to a movie, you know what you are likely to get. ""Avalanche"" features half-hearted performances, poor lighting and sound, minimal plot, ... ""special effects"" and some of the choppiest editing known to mankind. In fact, the only thing this dud is good for is a couple of unintentionally hysterical moments. The plot involves a newly built resort in Durango, Colorado. The owner is warned that he is in danger of triggering an avalanche because he is cutting down a lot of trees on a hillside. Characters are grossly underdeveloped and the film really goes nowhere. I advise you to stay clear of this one unless you are a Roger Corman fan."
3,Survival in Disaster,"What could be more exciting than watching, on a small screen, ice and snow coming at you at over a 100 mph. That's the basis of this film; but, more importantly, it shows the courage, ingenuity, and the will to survive by the people who visit Ski Resorts for fun and recreation. Heat up your drink, sit back, and relax and book your next vacation at a ski resort."
1,Underground Comedy,You need to watch this movie expecting it to be a spoof on disaster movies to get the jokes. Rescue team waiting to catch the kid hanging on the ski lift wire are not standing under him - when he falls they all watch him hit the ice off to the left. But first they make the kid wait until a camera man is set up to get it on film!! All the special effects scenes during the avalanche are hilarious. Watch how a chunk of snow coming in the resaurant window eventually causes the chef to put a huge pot of boiling hot soup on his head! This movie is a riot!!
4,The Legacy lives on,"Well, season one is a mixed bag if you are just getting into this series, its really just a good background set. Things got better in Season two and picked up all the way to the end of the series. Yet season one for all its great stand alone episodes, doesn't stand up to the other seasons as well. Its still worth the buy if you like paranormal tv shows, and if you're hemming and hawing...wait till season two is out and pick up both, and you can see the difference and have the background information."
5,One of the best!,"A combination mystery/adventure and supernatural - what could be better! It was a show that sparked the imagination while not insulting the viewer's intelligence. One of my favorite shows and like many other reviewers, I'm wondering when the rest of the seasons will become available for purchase? Very frustrating to have to wait such a long time with no word on when/if further seasons will be made available."
4,Paranormal Fun,"This is a fun, entertaining paranormal series. The show covers a full range of topics from witchcraft and voodoo to ghosts, mummies and a lost colony; enough diversity to keep it interesting. Those viewers who purchase a series called ""Poltergeist - The Legacy""...and then over analyze the writing and special effects should probably stick to documentaries. Personally, I'm looking forward to a second season of fun entertainment."
1,Rent First,"I have to agree with the minority voices. I rented the series first from Netflix and watched all of them to see if they would improve. They didn't. The actors are competent but the directing, writing and editing are pretty mediocre at best. The pilot/first episode was so bad I actually laughed during some of the intense moments.I also found myself fastforwarding to get through some of the unnecessary stuff. The stories tend to be cliche especially the ghost stories. If the writers did any serious research it is hard to tell because the plots are so typical and boring. I actually find Kolchak alot better. Also check out The Omega Factor. They are a little dated but I found them to be much better regarding the writing, acting and directing."
5,One of my all time favorites,"I have long awaited this series to be released and am disappointed that only season 1 is out so far. Can't wait for the other seasons to be released. This was one of those ground breaking shows that had mystery, action, suspense and horror all rolled into one. I liked all the characters and appreciated that the show gave each their own episodes and didn't concentrate on just the leader as so many other series with multiple characters do. The characters all had strengths and weaknesses as people in real life do and the show made good use of this.The DVD quality was excellent and the sound very good at least on the limited equipment I had available while watching it in Afghanistan. Can't wait to get it home and watch it on a full surround sound setup. If you're looking for a series that shows real life people in extrodinary situations then this would be one you should check out and add to your collection."
3,Coby just alright,"The Coby MP-C7097 is small, inexpensive, and works. Operation is confusing and built in speakers are not very good - as might be expected."
3,its ok but..,this one I used it and it did its job at the time of the year but once i went iphone i didnt look back.
2,Adequate At Best,"I bought this book with a lot of high hopes. What I got was a lot of second rate cakes that still tasted like cardboard boxes. The chocolate or more heavily flavored cakes turned out better than the white or yellow cakes, but considering all the preparations needed for most of these, it doesn't take any longer to bake from scratch.I grew up with a pastry chef for a grandmother. I remember what real homebaked goodies tasted like. Give yourself a break and try to bake from scratch when you can. You'll be amazed at the difference in flavor and texture. There are some nice simple baking books out there that can give you all the recipes you might ever need.Overall, this book can work for people interested in having a wide variety of cakes but not especially interested in baking. I was disappointed. It's on my ""giveaway"" shelf at the moment."
2,The Cake Mix Doctor is disappointing,"I was quite disappointed in this cookbook. I have tried about 15 different recipes and most are just average. I went exactly by the recipe and used exactly the ingredients called for in the recipe. I think the best one I tried was the ""Sock it to Me"" cake. (This is an old recipe I had used many years ago). That cake was very good! There are several more recipes I want to try and hopefully, I'll find one my family really likes!"
2,Not worth the money.,"These recipes are nothing special. There are only one or two recipes I would bother to try. Maybe I am just too critical because it is so easy to get good recipes online for free. Unless I can find a lot of recipes in a cookbook that I want to try, I feel I've wasted my money."
2,"Some good, some flops","Some of the recipes are good, just as many are flops. I am a good cook and follow the directions carefully. After experiencing another recipe flop, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you do, try each recipe to see if it works before making it for guests."
2,Novelty Wore Off Fast,"Intrigued by all the hoopla, I purchased this book and promptly invested in some prepared cake mixes. Five or six disappointing cakes later, I think it's time for me to give up. Although I really do like this as a concept, in my opinion the author's additions do very little to improve upon the cake mixes--there's just more to clean up. When all is said and done, I prefer a little more effort and a scratch cake, or in a pinch a pure box mix, I don't really think the morphing of the two works all that well."
3,Check the recipes on the boxes,"This book delivers as promised, but I realised that 90% of the recipes are the same as those on the boxes of the cake mixes.. Anne Byrn adds a few things here and there, and she could have just given the basic instructions on how to improve the basic mix, and recipes for icing, instead of devoting a page per cake."
4,We love cake!,"I bought this book after one of my co-workers brought in the Holy Cow Cake for a birthday treat. She gave me the recipe and I had to go home that night and make the cake. One piece just was not enough! I've made several of the recipes and all are easy to follow, look good and taste even better. My teenage daughters like the book because they can take a cake mix and make something really good for treats at school. The Cake Mix Doctor has been a treat for all of us."
5,The Doctor is IN!,"This book includes favorite recipes with a twist, everything is made from a cake mix with a few added ingredients. I made the Marble Gooey Cake and it was a hit! Maybe not for anyone on a diet or low-sugar intake, but for the rest of us...heaven begins in a box!"
5,fun cake cook book,"Totally awesome cookbook, 100s of suggestions and recipes to change up and fancy up purchased cake mixes. Most are fast and fun with a lot of flavor. This makes a good gift for the baker in your family."
4,Reliable Recipes,"I have not had a bad experience with any of the many recipes I have tried from this book. Some are more moist than I like, but the 'doctoring' always makes the taste unique and so much better than just a plain cake mix. It's worth it just for the frosting section. The canned grocery store frostings can't touch them."
5,What a WINNER!,Simple steps to making fantastic cakes - usually with ingredients you have on hand. I've already ordered more as gifts. A definite must.
2,The Cake Mix Doctor,"I make and decorate cakes all the time and thought this would be an excellent source for new recipes using cake mixes. I tried the Chocolate Chip Cake recipe and found that the 1 Cup of oil it called for made the cake very greasy. It also did not rise in the center, it actually sunk in the center which makes it difficult for decorating. I have only tried this one recipe out of the book and so far I'm not impressed."
5,Texas Review,"At last I can make cakes that taste like the ones my gransmother used to make. Every recipe I have baked so far has been excellent. this is the only ""Cake"" book you will ever need."
3,"good, but from scratch is better","I have this book, and have made 5 different recipes from it. My husband loves the Kahlua cake, and I love the Strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting. I made the Holy cow cake for a Halloween party (black and orange) I was really disapointed in it. It calls for Caramel and sweetened condensed milk to be poured over the top while the cake is still warm. It was like pudding. Very embarrasing. I also made the Amarretto cake, it baked up just beautiful, and then fell into the middle. My advise would be to follow the directions very closely, but no matter what you do, nothing beats a homemade from scratch cake. Some of these recipes take longer than it would to put together a cake from scratch to begin with. Good luck, and keep looking for a better cake recipe book, there are others that are much better."
3,Not as fabulous...,"as I had expected given the other positive ratings. I enjoyed reading about the science and history of cake mix and there are a few very good recipes...some are repeats and some are nothing new such as adding sour cream to a mix. I was most disappointed with the frosting recipes which can make or break a cake. Most of them are your typical confectioner's sugar recipes which are so overdone...and depending on the tempetaure and conditions can be gritty, runny and sticky. I would have liked to have seen more whipped cream frostings, shortening based frostings, pudding mix frostings, and not just several variations of confectioner's sugar frosting. Alao, many of the recipes are not as simple as they claim and it is just as much work to make a cake from scratch. This book is better than OK...but as an avid baker, good recipes come from everywhere."
4,Excellent!,This is a great cook book for anyone that wants to learn how to bake or knows how to bake. I made some cupcakes and brought for my co-workers and it was a huge hit!
5,"GREAT recipes, and so EASY!","I love to bake, but with two little ones, I rarely have time to focus on complicated recipes. These cakes are simply FABULOUS, and believe me, no one knows that they're from a mix. The Cake Doctor offers a kind of medicine found in no pharmacy that I know of -- the healing power of cake! Congratulations on a wonderful, and necessary, cookbook!"
5,Rediscoverd Jewel,"To be honest I bought this book about three years ago and tried only one recipe. It did not turn out well but that was my fault. Recently a co-worker brought in ""Hornet's Nest"" cake and got rave reviews. I made it twice this week to take in for birthdays, one being my boss's. I told her there was one slice left if she wanted to take it home to her husband. She grinned and said no that they were going to Michigan this weekend and she was stopping on the way to buy the ingredients to make it for everyone they will be with! My advice is read the directions and use only the type of mix called for. It makes a huge difference in the way it comes out...trust me on this! Bottom line it is a very creative book."
5,Perfect For A Bachelor,"I am a single guy. With this book I make great, impressive desserts for office parties or even an intimate dinner. Hey, we guys can bake too! It's easy to follow and I get all sorts of compliments from the ladies! Especially on my lemon squares!"
5,So Fun!,"Love this book! I have a large extended family and when we get together most times we bring something. Everyone wants me to bring the desert now. Around the fall and winter holidays are my busiest times at work and when the family gets together the most. These recipes are almost as fast as just making the cake with a mix. It saves time not only prepping but also shopping. I have tried a lot of the recipes and they never look or taste like something from a cake mix. Some are great for kids and some are gourmet enough for the foodie adults. Many times I bake two different to bring and everyone eats both! Well, except for my nephew that hates anything chocolate."
5,Great book with simple to follow recipes!,I previewed this book at my library and decided it was a must-have for my collection! I have tried about 10 recipes from this book and all of them have turned out great!
2,Disappointing Results,"The book makes it seem so simple - add a couple of extra ingredients to a box cake mix and get a great tasting cake! Unfortunately, that's not the results I'm getting. I've tried the Lemon Buttermilk Poppy Seed and the Fresh Orange cakes and both went straight into the trash. The cakes look good and bake up very moist, but they are almost flavorless. I will try a couple more recipes before I give up on it completely."
4,Tasty Cakes!,"This is a fun little cookbook. It has a picture of every cake at the beginning of the book, which is a nice visual guide. I have made the pumpkin cake many times, and we often make it along with pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. The recipes are very easy to follow, and most of the recipes call for ingredients that you would find in any pantry. Almost all of the recipes are also fairly quick to put together. If you need a cake in a pinch, this is a great cookbook to reach for."
5,Favorite cookbook EVER!,"I love,love, love this cookbook! I received it as a gift from a friend about 6 years ago. All the recipes I've tried have been so good and so easy. I look forward to occasions to try out new cakes and share them with my friends and family! Highly recommended!"
3,Boring and Bland.,Not what I thought it would be. Bought it on recommendation unseen and am not happy. Recipe always calls for at least one item I do not have at the ready. Frustrating. Pictures are black and white...blah. Nothing looks tempting. I want cakes that ooze temptation and originality.
1,Disappointing results,So far I have made three cakes from this book the last one being the Chocolate Sheet Cake. I used the Chocolate pan frosting instead of the peanut butter. The frosting separates from the cake and the cake would have been much better if I had just followed the directions on the box. The cake was dry and tasteless while we usually like the cake as Betty Crocker suggests.
1,not worth the effort,I made the much touted cannoli cake. Despite all of the added ingredients to the mix it still tasted like a cake mix. The ricotta filling did not set up properly. I followed the directions for the buttercream frsoting to a tee and it was wretched-I could have added some vanilla to Crisco shortening and it would hacve tasted the same.
1,As phony as the photoshop cake...,"Seriously, take a look at the cover and you'll notice that there is a thick layer of ""icing"" between the cake and the plate, an obvious fake. That cover photo is pretty indicative of every recipe in the book, which are all versions of ""take a cake mix- add some more faux ingredients, like, perhaps, a can of tomato soup, and call it homemade"". The results are chemical-tasting fluffy rubber cakes that have become the norm of the industrial age. It's so sad that most "" cake ladies"", even the ones with fancy websites are not doing any authentic baking anymore.If you want to bake for your family, try ""The Weekend Baker"" which gives good strategies for a home cook to produce excellent baked goods."
1,Don't buy this!!!!,"These cake recipes are loaded with fat,calories and sugar! I would rather bake gourmet cakes using butter, eggs and sugar and have something really delicious to eat. Buy ""Perfect Cakes"" instead. All of the recipes are wonderful and if your going to eat cake, eat a cake that's worth eating!"
5,You'd Think It Was A Gormet Cake,"On the recommendation of a friend, I purchaed this book sight unseen. Believe me, it worth it's weight in GOLD! No special ingredients needed and the final result will keep your guests quessing!Everything is clearly listed and just follow the step-by-step instructions. Don't be shocked by the titles or ingredients that you supplement to a boxed ""cake mix's"" mundain and tasteless mixture. I would highly recommend: ""Zesty Cranberry Cake"" and/or the ""Sweet Potato Cake. The ""Deeply Chocolate Almond Cake"" will tempt and tanalize any chocolate enthusiast. This cake cook book will be an inexpensive and creative addition to your library of cook books."
5,"great for ""instant"" cake!","i normally bake from scratch, but this is wonderful for when you need something PDQ.I have a number of these recipes already (have been making dump cake, chocolate covered cherry cake & rum cake for almost 40 years...I like my recipes a bit more), but the rest are awesome to try for something quick & easy."
5,Great book,"This cookbook is exactly as it says, it takes an ordinary cakemix and jazzes it up with a few inredients that one usually has in the kitchen, like extra eggs or sour cream. Have tried most of the recipies and they are winners and I almost always bake from scratch. These recipies are a real time saver and well worth making, have already been asked for the recipie on many of the new creations."
5,So easy! So good!,"I already owned the paperback version of this book. Often when I made a cake from one of the recipes people would comment on the cake and ask for the recipe. I have decided to buy myself a hardback as well as a few more paperbacks to give away. Now people won't have to sit and write down the recipes. I'll just give them the book! The Strawberry cake with fresh strawberries, coconut, and cream cheese frosting gets raves every time. This book makes it easy to cook a crowd pleaser."
5,I wish I had foundt this earlier,"I LOVE this book! Everything I've made from the CMD is delicious and defies a cake mix stereotype. It's exactly what a working person needs. Last night I came home from work after 9:00 p.m., baked Susan's Lemon cake from ""scratch"" and was done and finished in time for the 11 o'clock news, and that included making the frosting glaze. My friends loved it so much that several asked for the recipe! I had to confess that it had started life as a yellow cake mix. Where I avoided cake mixes before, I now keep a stock of ""bases"" so that I can create something delicious when I have to."
4,Perfect gift,"I received this book as a gift several years ago and love it. While I was trying to think of a small gift for co-workers, I pulled it out and used it to bake cookies from a cake mix & decided it was the perfect gift! I ordered 4 at discounted prices & everyone was happy to get the new recipes. I like referring to the pictures to see the finished product."
3,Watch Out - Some Recipes Are A Disaster,"I bought this book when it came out in 1999, and maybe there were some mistakes I am not aware of. I have made at least a dozen of the recipes and they were fine, but a couple more were unmitigated disasters. I could tell from the ingredient list and amounts that something didn't feel quite right, but I proceeded to do exactly as the recipe said. Stacy's Chocolate Chip Cake called for one cup of milk and one cup of oil. ONE CUP of oil. The cake never baked entirely and fell into a gooey mass once removed from the oven. Go with your gut instincts on some of these if you are a seasoned cook, if it looks like too much liquid or not enough, there is probably a mistake in the recipe."
4,Want to cheat and get away with it? Then this is your book!,"Right out of the gate, if you are a baking snob and can't get past the idea of boxed cake mix, instant pudding or canned cherries then walk on by. But if you are someone like me, who loves to bake and occasionally needs a ""good cheat"" due to your crazy, time-pressured life, then whip out your wallet and buy a copy of this bad-boy. I have made about seven or eight cakes out of this book and have had very good results. The author is adventurous in her flavoring ideas and manages to lift a Duncan Hines mix from ordinary to interesting (and in many cases, company-worthy). There are lots of ideas here, which can easily inspire your own variations. It's well worth every penny of its modest cover price."
5,I've been converted!,"Like many others, I wasn't so sure about this book at first. It is a really fun read, but could box cakes really taste like they're made from scratch? So far I've made one chocolate cake, one coffee cake and the Bacardi Rum cake. All three cakes tasted great with the chocolate and the coffee cakes tasting homemade. The Rum cake tasted like a cake mix cake but it was still very good. I've given the book a 5 star rating just because I'm so excited about making more cakes. I've already bought two more boxes of mix to experiment with. There's nothing quite like a little success in the kitchen."
4,Some good ones...,"I've now made a few recipes from this book and I would definitely recommend the chocolate ones. I made the sour cream chocolate cupcakes, but put on the quick caramel frosting, and they were out of this world! Seriously -- I've made them three times now and can't get enough. That icing is awesome. I originally made the cupcakes with the sour cream chocolate frosting, but found it to be too thin. Also, the yellow mix recipes don't cover the flavor of cake mix very well. Plus, the texture is still spongey and compact, unlike the chocolate recipes.The chocolate peanut butter bars are also awesome. I think the recipes are just pretty much hit or miss. The good ones are great and the bad ones still taste like cake mix (if not worse because you're expecting something so much better!!)."
3,Cake Doctor Review,"I bought this book thinking that it would contain some easy and quick recipes. It does, however, the ingredients lists for the recipes are as long as recipes you make from scratch. I would have been more satisfied with a recipe book that required a pre-packaged cake mix + 3 or 4 ingredients, not 5-8!! You might as well make them from scratch."
4,The Cake Mix Doctor,I love the book. The instructions are easy to follow but sometimes my cakes have that gooey bottom and I can't understand why. The cakes taste great
2,Ah its ok,Its ok but i would not buy again. Nothing special you can find all the recipes on line. The book is ok but not worth the price
5,2 must haves: The Joy of Cooking and The Cake Mix Doctor!,Let's just say that I'm buying a copy for all my friends (and I've gained 5 pounds since getting it)
5,great cake book,I enjoy using this book. Simple recipes that turn out perfect every time.All recipes tried are wonderful. Great cake book for anyone.
3,"Eh, not too bad","I thought this song was ok, but it just doesn't sound right for the lead singer. Its almost like trying to listen to an old singer sing a song that he sang better when he was younger. Here is an example, Barry Gibb trying to hit the notes he used to hit on his songs, it just doesn't work anymore for him. Although its not terrible, I think that after a few times listening to it, you will start liking it more and probably sing it yourself."
5,Our whole church is studying this book.,"This book was recommended to me by my daughter and I informed my Pastor about it, who began a series of Bible study based on the book."
5,Love it,This book is awesome and easy to read. Love anything on spiritual warefare and was able to tie everything back to scripture!
5,Good workbook,"I already have this workbook and gave it to my daughter. I bought another one for myself and my in law. Very powerful workbook. I would recommend this to those interested in this subject matter,"
5,My 2nd copy!,I have had part one for years and wanted to replace it due to it being worn. I saw part two and had to have it. Both books are informative and helpful during prayer and study.
5,Amazing!!!!,"I received this book within a short period of time after the order was placed. The book was purchased new so the condition of the book was excellent. If you are seeking something more in your spiritual walk, this book is for you. This book is amazing!!!! I will continue to order my books new or used and other items through amazon."
5,ANOTHER MUST READ BOOK,I loved it. It does wonders in explaining how demons work on a person's life & how you can deal with them & get rid of them once & for all. This book holds so much information. My husband & I both read it many times & even bought the sequal to it.
5,Strongman's His Name...What's His Game?,"There are no words to describe how powerful this book is. I don't ever remember being so excited in reading a book. This one did it for me! It's the BOMB....all the way....I could not put it down....and now all my friends want the same book. It's dynamite....It's an eye opener, to put it mildly. I LOVE THIS BOOK! The truths are setting me FREE!"
5,Strongman's Name/Game,I purchased this book for our pastor and his wife. I was already familiar with it and wanted them to have a copy of it as well for use in their deliverance ministry. It's very clear and easy to understand and very informative.
1,Don't bother with this one,"Wretched psychohistory - guessing what people in Kipling's India thought, covering all topics with generalizations, and deriving unsupported interpretations, fraught with symbolism. Bah!"
4,Specific Insight,"Found REWIRE to be very helpful in a very specific circumstance. Experienced executives or other professionals should not be confused with those individuals who are just looking for ""greener pastures"".With a myriad of other self-help books about changing jobs and careers REWIRE specifically addresses those at a later stage of their career. It was nice to not be lumped with a bunch of dissatified thirty-somethings!"
4,Helpful and Thought-provoking,"'Rewire' lays out a very helpful and thought-provoking step by step approach. It is rife w useful 'real-life' examples, altho they are predominately taken from the executive ranks. This is not a quick read -- you need to have your journal at hand and do some thinking and writing to get the maximum benefit."
4,A CD + DVD=BETTER THEN NORMAL,"THIS CD IS THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL VERSION. HAS ALL THE HIT SONG'S WE HAVE ALL COME TO LOVE AND KNOW BY THE BLACK EYED PEAS FROM THIS HIT CD.THE SPECIAL THING ABOUT THIS IMPORT VERSION IS IT COME'S WITH A DVD.IT HAS FIVE HIT VIDEO'S FROM THIS CD AND THE PICTURE QUALITY IS GREAT.BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE PROBLEM THE SOUND ON THE DVD IS HORRIBLE FOR SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT IN 2005.FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I PLAY THE BONE~THUGS~HARMONEY DVD I PUT THE SOUND ON THE STEREO ON 15.TO GET THE SAME SOUND OUT OF THIS DVD YOU HAVE TO PUT THE VOLUME ON 25.WHY THAT IS I DO NOT KNOW BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET THIS CD BUY THIS CD/DVD VERSION INSTEAD OF JUST THE PLANE CD. PLUS IF YOU WATCH THE DVD JUST OUT OF YOUR T.V. SPEAKERS YOU WILL NOT EVEN CARE ABOUT HOW LOUD THE BASS IS.{TONY~TONI~TON`E}/[ROME,NEW YORK]"
1,What an outrageous group!,"What an outrageous group, how can anyone like this rubbish. Maybe an horde of brainless people. How I feel happy in being intelligent, and live my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres. How said Romans, it's just bread and circus to the poors. Give to people what they deserve, rubbish! It's because mediocre people that buy this, that this kind of people, the members of this group, get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be. It's the same horde that buy, Beyonce, Spears, Madona, and other outrageous poor music."
1,Flavorless cakes,These popcorn cakes are my absolute favorite snack....when made properly. I have bought them locally and the cakes would be plain popcorn and no white cheddar or salt flavoring and others would be great. After this happened atleast 6 times at my local grocery store I decided to go through amazon thinking maybe it was a bad batch made locally. The box I got had 12 bags (24 foil packs) of cakes and only 4 foil packs out of 24 had flavor. Without the flavor they are absolutely tastless and bland. I had previously called Orville Redenbacher and the customer service agent said since it takes one second to make a cake that if the machine that flavors them is down they could have pushed through a hundred cakes before knowing. This doesn't save me all the money I have wasted. It really is a shame because they are delicious when done right. My husband finally said STOP buying them since we always get disappointed.
5,My favorite of the sweet pickes books,"Unicorn is having a Birthday... she is also very old. That doesn't mean she doesn't want to have a ""fun"" birthday party. Too bad all of her friends assume she will not want to eat any yummy food or have any fun at her celebration, but will instead want a stuffy banquet with mushy food. Old folks couldn't possibly like peanut butter or potato chips because ""Peanut butter sticks to their mouth and potato chips have sharp points when you bite them!"" It turns out that the sweet pickles gang is wrong about what unicorn wants to do for her birthday. Thankfully wise Zebra encourages everyone (including Unicorn)to be themselves and tell the truth about how they want to celebrate Unicorn! This book makes me laugh every time I read it. The message is great! Older people still like to have fun and aren't serious all of the time. Especially Sweet Pickle's Unicorn."
5,A nice article,"I bought this item as I thought it was well made, Klein makes some great tools. It feels heavy and is really quality made. Real leather. You won't be sorry!"
5,Gripping stuff. Kept me guessing until the final page.,Very evocative writing. Makes you feel like you are ther in the Highlands
1,Inaccessible...,"It's a good thing I was reading on my Kindle as I would have been hard pressed to get through this book without the built in dictionary. The definitions of most words I looked up began with, ""ARCHAIC"" or ""ANCIENT."" The author also thought it would be clever to include cute local dialect with no clear indication of what it meant. I love murder mysteries but this one left me feeling cold and lifeless..."
4,"Good story, poor quality paperback","This is the second Graham Thomas mystery I've read. It's actually the first of his books. I liked the Malice in Cornwall a bit better, but this one is good. He has good descriptions of place, and his characters are well developed and easily become real. BUT, the paperback book itself is annoying. The text nearly disappears into the spine of the book, so you have to firmly hold it almost flat in order to read the end of each line! Pretty cheap."
3,Didn't connect with me,"We all can agree that Thibaudet is a wonderful pianist. However when playing transcriptions of Bill Evans' work the technical feats take precedence over the visceral meaning of the music, and consequently, in general, this album is not very enjoyable. Indeed, the essential Evans can only be found listening to Evans himself. While Mr. Thibaudet can play the notes, the runs, the trills....the sense is that there is some meritricious glazing under which is some very ordinary music. I wish I could be more complimentary. Try Shearing's Grand Piano albums to hear what a true jazz pianist can do. Mr. Thibaudet should stay with Debussy and Paulenc."
5,Fabulous is as Fabulous does,"I have had the pleasure of seeing Jamila perform live in person and it is, in a word: fabulous. For those that don't or can't get out to LA, do yourself a favor and pick up this CD of funked out jams, and dramatic, moving ballads. There is magic in the way ""Don't Worry"" starts out fast and upbeat, and dissolves into a gospel-esque passionate bridge that shows off the power of her voice before returning to its rumpshaking chorus. ""Good Things"" will test the power of your speakers as they thump and you nod your head to thick bass and whimsical keys. But don't take my word for it. Pick it up."
2,Not that impressed!,[...] As a 5 year veteran of background work I looked at this book more seriously than a newcomer and although the information is available all over the internet it does bring it together under one roof. It's not that well written or up to date but for someone brand new it's a start.
5,Career Saving Education,"This book is a great source for finding casting agencies in the extra's field and then some. They give graphs on the type of work each one casts for and information on how to properly contact said agencies. Their reviews are fair and unbiased. They share testimonies from individuals who had dealings in each reviewed and offer the reports for your research. However; their reviews are still close to hand-in-hand with the BBB ratings. If information on any business is unclear you will find them neutrally listed until verified for the next edition. It also includes rights applicaple to Non-union, SAG, and AFTRA talent directly drawn from their respective laws. You can also find Tax saving ideas, wardrobe suggestions, resume examples, and much more. As a matter of fact they themselves rank well with the BBB. These ladies and their book wised me up to many a scams. A must have in this field."
1,the best book ever,u guys out there this book here will help you become a extra or a movie star you should read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointed,"I would be careful purchasing products from this company. I bought this gym as a Christmas present, but received the product missing one of the most important parts -- the ladder! When I contacted the company originally, they said they would look into this and get back to me. I haven't heard from them since! They've been ignoring the e-mails I've sent since that one asking for a status and given absolutely no reply. I'm really disappointed!! An exchange or a refund would be welcomed, but I can't get any type of reply from them. Very frustrating!"
1,Horrific,Do NOT buy this product. Someone else stated that they did not receive a ladder and this happened to me as well. And the ladder is one of the most important piece. I do not recommend buying this toy because the chances of you missing a piece is very likely.
2,It could be better...,"The product is good BUT the liquid gells up in a way that you can't use it anymore. It felt bad, like throwing money in the garbage can."
2,What they don't tell you...TIP,"Here's how to make it last, and it's easy: put it in the refrigerator! That's all! The alcohol inside evaporates quickly at room temperature. When it does, you've wasted a lot of money. To prolong the life of the product, just put it in the fridge. Of course, it also helps to be quick about it!I can tell you that the company does NOT want people to know this because I emailed them to ask if it was okay, just to see what they would say really, and they told me that I ""would not be able to do that."" Who's gonna stop me? I replied that I did not see why not. They must not have liked that, because they never replied and never sent me the refund they said they would!So, now you know how to extend the usefulness of the product. Better yet, go for the cheapo brand, put THAT in the fridge, and save yourself even more money!"
1,Useless,"Worked fine the first day, then was completely unusable because it got all gummy. Waste of my money. Plus the smell!"
1,Useless,"EDIT: So yeah, I got the gel. WAY better. It is much easier to apply, it does not smell as bad, and it hasn't dried up yet./editAs others have said, this stuff coagulates into a lumpy, useless mess. I just pulled out the entire contents of the bottle in one long, gross wad of rubbery goo.I think the problem is the bottle itself. Whenever I closed it up and set it aside, I could still smell the chemicals, even after a couple of days of not opening the bottle. So it seems as though the bottle seals inadequately. Keeping the bottle in a zip-lock bag or some sort of an air-tight container might work, but I'm not buying another one just to find out.Avoid this. I've heard the gel does not dry out, so you might want to have a look at that."
1,Stick with Dr. Scholl's,"This stuff gels up the instance you take the stick out of the jar and doesn't spread using the provided applicator. I thought it was just the applicator, but it's the liquid. Stick with Dr. Scholl's if you want the liquid, even though this tends to be cheaper in stores. I had to throw this away since it wouldn't come off the stick."
1,Bottle with brush dries out,I hadn't used the Compound W product that comes in the bottle with the brush before. However it was the only Compound W product in stock at the store. I discovered the product begins drying out as soon as the bottle is opened. It begins by starting to gel and becomes difficult to apply. I was only able to make a couple of applications. The product became completely unusable before I was able to use very much. The majority of the product was wasted. It will not store once it has been opened. I will not buy it again.
1,huge disappointment,"I've used the Duofilm liquid treatment for a huge plantar wart on my foot. Worked like a charm and it never came back. Years later, I discovered some small warts on my hands. I was only able to find the Compound W in stores this time so I decided to give it a try. All this product ended up doing was cause the skin to build up and harden over the warts themselves, basically forming a protective layer over the warts. Also caused painful stinging and it became gel-like and completely unapplicable within a few uses. Maybe the gel version would be easier to control, but I'm not sure the results would be any better..."
2,"Fine product delivery, product has issues though.","Product came promptly. As other reviewers commented, the product gel-ed up and became unusable for me also after a couple weeks. Now I need to seek a different product."
2,Not Good,A few days after I opened the container the entire contents dried into a solid mass and was impossible to use. Go with another product.
2,Not as great as they claim it to be,"I bought this to use on a very small wart on my hand but it didn't take care of the problem. I thought that the 30% acid formula would be fast acting but the 17% stuff works better. Apart from the terrible smell, the product doesn't do much but burn the skin. For me it formed this hard jelly-like surface over the area on which I applied it preventing me from applying more over it and when it did come off, I was left with the wart and some extremely sensitive skin around it. So I don't recommend this stuff. The best treatments are the long term ones like Wartrol that take quite a while for it to go away but they don't come back afterwards and it don't burn the skin either!"
1,"It drys out after 4 tries. Company knows this, does nothing.","this liquid will dry out after 4 - 8 uses leaving 90% of the bottle worthless. read the many reviews here confirming this. the company does nothing about it. i suppose they think that you will buy another bottle, which i did. 4 of them in fact, before i found out about DuoFilm, which is sold here at amazon."
1,Poorly designed product,"Cant really comment on how it works in the longrun yet. Seems to have burned most of the wart off, not sure if it will grow back or not.My biggest beef is that the stuff is really hard to apply. It seems to clump and dry on the applicator before you can even spread it. Because of this i had to push hard to spread any on the skin. Several areas of skin that did not have a wart got burned off due to the lack of application control. I would not buy this product again due to this fact alone. I still have 3/4 of a bottle but it is all jelly like and wont spread. There are better products out there for the money."
3,Needs a better applicator,"This works okay, but the liquid dries on the applicator super quickly making it hard to apply. My applicator tip is a hard gooey mess now. The product still works, but it's hard to apply to a small spot with the applicator all a muck as it now is."
2,Works but unusable after a week or so,"Like the others have said, the product works but for some reason becomes a gel inside the bottle and impossible to use. It really sucks throwing money away like that. I still need some so I'll be trying the gel instead."
1,Not a TEN Degree bag,"This bag will not keep you warm down to ten degrees (I'd say around 40). It is lightweight, but as the temp. drops, you will have to wear some layers or add a liner. If you can not afford a more expesive lightweight bag, this may be for you. It is roomy, the zippers work good and the hood is easy to close/open. It stuffs down very small. I would give it more stars, but it should not be called a ten degree bag."
3,Eh,I bought the book for a class and we didn't use it at all. Save your money if you don't NEED the book.
5,Pennsylvania Spice Box Plan,As advertised detailed plan with all necessary information to build the spice box and impress all who see it and give you something to boast about
2,And they dare to call this a romance novel.,"I'm old fashioned in the heart matters, when I read a romance novel, I expect to find the hero and heroine to fall in love with each other. In this story, I'm not even sure whether they did fall in love. Oh well, three pages before it ends, the three sacred words are said, but the essence of love itself is just not there. BM seemed to be in a hurry to finish the book. After reading about 180 pages, I was told, there... they are in love, end of story. Such a contrary to BM's best: Angel Bride, Bride in the Ranch, etc."
4,This book is so cute,"I got this book for the art unit about trains I teach my K's. The story is a bit thin, but I love cats and so do the kids. We talk about trains, toy trains and scale. The cover art is fun to talk about too--at first they do not realize what the ""tunnel"" is. Wish I had an elmo to really do the book justice."
1,Not Worth The Hardcover Price,"As an avid reader of most romance, and a fan of this author, this story was a disapointment. I found the story to move extremely slow and at times was just plain boring. I agree with another reviewer that all romance does not have to have strong sensuality, but the entertainment value still needs to be there. This book didn't do it for me, and was no where near worth $14.95."
4,Cute,This book was very cute. That is about the word for it. No serious plot and you can guess from the beginning what will happen. None the less cute and an enjoyable afternoon read!
4,Good Read,I was very impressed by this book. It was extremely romantic but it wasn't dirty. I would like to see many more books like this. Bravo.
2,Just didn't do it for me.,"I thought this was going to make up for the the terrible read, ""Lawless"" by Diana Palmer, but it didn't. Slow is the only word that comes to mind. The writing was mediocre and it seemed rushed. Plot was original but then the writing didn't seem to carry it very far. I didn't like the characters, found them too sweet and sugary. All in all, not very satisfying."
4,"A Sweet, Romantic Comedy!!!!","The Snow Bride by Debbie MacomberJenna Campbell, an unhappy executive's assistant, finds Dalton Gray on the internet, so is on her way to Alaska to actually meet him to see if he is worth marrying, but sitting next to her on her flight is Reid Jamison, who is everything against what she is looking for. Reid attempts totell her that Dalton is a low-life, which she won't believe, so Reid kidnaps her and they are holed up in his Snowbound cabin during a 3 day storm where some funny antics throw them together.When Dalton finds out what has happened, he gets Jenna's mom involved, who in turn gets Jenna's ex boss involved, causing more excitement to ever hit the small town of Snowbound. If you enjoy romantic comedies, Debbie Macomber's books are the place to be.Forever Friends Rating 4 Stars by TeriUntil Next Time, See You Around The Book Nook.Mira BooksPub. Date: October 2003240pp"
2,Pretty mediocre read,"Debbie MaComber is usually alot better than this latest book. The dialogue is stiff and at times unbelievable. It reminds me of a novice writer that hasn't quite got their writing technique down. It also reminds me of Sandra Brown's very early works, pretty boring and poorly written. I'm trying to get through this thing, I do not recommend it to anyone. This writer was in a big hurry when she ""wrote"" this one. I bet I could do as good. YUCK!!!"
2,Like reading a script when you wanted to see the movie,"Okay, yes, the plot is cute. But its full potential (even for humor) is never explored. By far the most likable characters are the minor ones (i.e. the indomitable Chloe), there's almost no visual detail, characters' motives are barely touched on, and everything seems flat. The villain is so cheesy it's ridiculous. All in all, this book is an extremely light read despite its length; if you want a real Christmas pick-me-up, do what you have to do to find a copy of Rexanne Becnel's Christmas Journey."
5,Move Over Cassanda Wilson,"I became SO addicted to this particular album that I bought 2 copies for personal usage, and I played it over the phone to my companion who was stationed in Iraq during the time. Lizz's voice is so powerful and detailed when it comes to setting the mood for each track on this album that when the song is over you will reach for the remote to demand an encore. I guarantee that every track will leave a positive impression amongst its listeners for the combination of Lizz's voice and song selections is what I have been waiting for Smooth Jazz to introudce to the scene- and I am 100% satisfied!"
5,good!,This cd has a great soul feeling to it. Up-beat rhythm and she sounds really great at just speaking her mind with a soft mellow voice. I think this singer will make for a good time in the music business.
5,BLOWN AWAY,"This cd completely blew me away. Not only did Miss Wright bring a soulful,silky, smooth voice to the table.... she delivered meaningful material. Each song tells a story and has the timeless quality that made Billie, Sarah, Ella and company legends. I certainly hope the listening public doesn't sleep on this one."
5,SALT=FLAVOR,"As I sit here writing this review, I'm sipping on some Cabernet Sauvignon, incense is unfurling, and Lizz Wright's voice is majestically floating through the house (that's the ambience she creates-smooth and relaxing). To say that I like this cd is an understatement, I have not been able to play anything else, other than Roy Hargrove's ""RH Factor"" lately. Vocally, Lizz is a cross between Oleta Adams and Wendy Moten. She possess a rich and clear alto with subtle dynamics and the music arrangements are great as well. My favs are ""Open Your Eyes, Salt, Soon As I Get Home, Walk With Me, Lord, Fire, and End Of The Line.""If you love jazz with an uncut vocalist, check out Lizz. She's definitely impressed me."
2,HHHMMMMMMM!,"Firstly, I would like to start this review off by saying that Ms wright has a great voice. It is sultry, seductive, haunting. Her voice to me isn't the problem with this album. I think it is the material. The reason why I purchsaed this CD, was based on 'Salt' which I had downloaded from itunes, and is, for me the best cut of this CD. The rest of the material doesn't move or inspire me(aside from a beautiful cover of 'walk with me Lord')To these ears is begins to sound samey. I see she has a new CD slated for June of this year. I awaited to hear how she has progressed."
4,&#65533;Salt&#65533; is undisputedly the best album from a new artist to e,"I know everyone is going to try to categorize Lizz Wright as a Jazz vocalist.However, it won't stick, because Lizz Wright truly transcends the ""Jazz"" genre.True, her vocal style and ability will satisfy the most discriminating Jazz purist; but it will please lovers of R&B, folk, and pop just as well. With talented musicians, tight arrangements, and excellent engineering, ""Salt"" is undisputedly the best album from a new artist to emerge this year. The maturity and sophistication that this 23 year old vocalist displays is amazing. Ms. Wright truly has the potential to become the greatest artist of her generation."
4,A Wonderful New Talent,"I just happened upon this CD when I was in a music store recently. I had no idea who this young woman was but after listening to the entire album at the listening station, I was hooked. Lizz has a nice sultry, soulful sound. Salt, Afro Blue and Eternity are my favorites but the entire album is good. Some reviewers have compared her with Norah Jones. As much as I like Norah, I think these two have totally different sounds. Also, this album has a greater variety of tempos; some upbeat songs and others more mellow. A great first recording by Lizz Wright! Hope the Grammy folks are listening, too."
4,WONDERFUL!!!,"I listen to this cd every weekend. I LOVE it!! Everyone I pass along the cd to, is inlove with her. She has her own sound. As she said "" they cannot take your song from you."" Love it!! Keep putting the music out!! You go girl!!!"
5,Awesome!,"I really love this CD. I was very impressed from the first time that I heard it. Lizz has a wonderful voice and I think that she will have a long lived career. I would definately recommend this CD to all jazz lovers, as well as, those looking to build a jazz collection."
4,Eternity,"This is a great debut by a very strong vocalist. Somewhere between r&b & jazz, Lizz Wright has a gorgeous voice with a clear pitch and resonance. The spiritual track is exceptional. The traditional ""Walk With Me"" has great percussion by Jeff Haynes on tablas and Lizz's strong vocals soaring over the jazz riffs John Hart's guitar & Doug Weiss's acoustic bass. On Wright's own ""Eternity,"" she writes a track that builds exquisitely, ""I will find the answer & the answer is you, my love, I have to have you for eternity."" On ""Fire"" Kenny Banks' Hammond B3 sets the stage for Lizz's aching vocal and her self-penned lyric, ""Are you frightened by the fire in my eyes? It burns for you; and I know you see it too, your heart was open looking for light."" Lizz Wright's CD is a wonderful beginning from this obviously talented future star! Enjoy!"
3,Salt by Liz Wright,I love the soulful voice of the artist but this cd did not impress in the way her last 2 have.
5,I Can't Believe I Waited This Long,"I had this CD on my Amazon.com wishlist for 8 long years, when I decided to buy it. And now I see why the CD was a hit when it was first released. Very good CD!"
5,Amazing Saxophone Player And Musician,"A few weeeks ago I looking around for some more smooth jazz to listen to and by accident I came across Jimmy Reid I was familiar with him but never really listened to his music I decided to listen to the song "" India"" and I immeditaly purchased the cd when it arrived I put on the song "" Cool Vibe "" and I must say, I myself is a saxophone player and play with many smooth jazz musicians and after hearing this cd i can honestly say Jimmy Reid is one of the best! This cd is great! every song has something new and interesting and Jimmy Reid has a mature saxophone sound that makes this cd wonderful !!! This is something you must add to your cd collection - Even if you dont like jazz you will like this cd!!!!"
3,"Good for Beginners, but Quickly Becoming Dated","There are many positive aspects to this book. The basic information concerning the structure and planning of a multimedia project is solid and clear. Korolenko goes to great lengths to make this book ""user friendly"" while at the same time giving a clear view of how things work in the multimedia business. The case studies are relevant when focused on the basics, but are rather dated in nature since many of the projects discussed are no longer on the market, and Splash Studios, one of the companies that becomes his major focus, apparently disappeared during the dotbomb era. Korolenko also provides a decent history of multimedia through the late 1990s. What he fails to do is consider the coming impact of the Internet on multimedia writing. While not a completely disappointing read, it could use a serious update after almost ten years in print."
5,CPA Exam,I found this study guide very useful in studying for the FAR section of the CPA exam. Although it was published in 2003 I have found that the questions remain current with 2008. The study guide contains additional multiple choice questions that aren't listed in the standard FAR Becker software.
3,tolerable,"informative but it has to many personal opinions in it, i was looking for a book full of facts instead i end up reading one breeders way of doing things."

5,lalaine single,"I have always been a fan of lalaines and i gotten back into her music recently and i came across this cd single from 2005 and i found the CD to be cool, and music i could relate to and rock out to. lalaine is talented and i wish she had put more music out by herself cause she is fun to listen to. my only downside i felt was that i wish the single which has two songs on it was a full lenght album but its great to see what she can do with herself.most of her music is about love and things that most teens and older folks can relate to.the songs are catchy and make you want to sing along to them and my favorite song on the two track single would have to be a song called ''Did you hear about us'' very rock styled song.If your a fan of lalaine or pop rock music this cd should be in your collection. the cd and her music lets you see another side of lalaine than what most people know her for which was on the tv show ''Lizzie Mcguire''"
5,The complexities of Indian cuisine simplified.,"Quite simply the best and most diverse book on Indian cuisine on the market. The variety in all areas is superb and yearns for the reader to try out even the seemingly most complex of recipes. If you are interested in Indian cooking and you haven't bought this book, then why not."
4,mh21,"Quite a good book. I'm from the Indian subcontinent and I'm already an avid cook. I haven't made any recipes from the book (yet), but it has given me a few ideas to give some of my existing dishes a different edge. I do think that it is for an advanced cook rather than for beginners and even I find some of the ingredients list a bit daunting. However, I bought my book pre-owned for only $4.01 which was a great bargain."
3,A sad blot on a previously wonderful discography,"Poor Cecilia! She seems to be in a lot of vocal trouble on this CD. And the superficiality of many of the pieces doesn't help. Don't get me wrong--her musical imagination is still as magical as ever, but the voice just isn't there to back it up. She seems stuck between her LOVELY pre-1996 mezzo and the more thinned-out uncomfortable soprano sound she's had since. This is bad news for just about every piece, whether sustained or florid. There are still some beautiful phrases here and there, but on the whole it was a nearly heartbreaking experience to undergo, with painful high notes and a general sense of awkwardness. The final piece, ""La Danza"", sounded clunky and forced, with badly-placed breaths, rather than exuberant. I for one ardently hope that she can recover from whatever has been affecting her these past couple of years. I want the real Cecilia--the one who can sing Rossini and Mozart better and more sensitively than anyone else--back."
1,Euww.,"This illustrates the sad state opera is in. Bartoli's voice is unclear, her darkness forced, and there's no ring--what one can find in any good classical voice (Freni, Pavarotti, Sutherland, Corelli, Caballe, Tucker, Merril, etc.) I'm distressed at just how much she butchers these fabulous pieces of music."
3,PC nuts and bolts,"This book was raved over on all the reviews that I read; however, for the actual intention of my purpose (to create custom interfaces to data acquisition), not much is given in the way of examples and the actual connection between the PC and the world.Don't misunderstand this review, it IS an excellent book...for understanding EXACTLY what is going on in the PC and how it handles data, but the interface and acquisition part is a little wanting."
5,Excellent Album!,"I love this CD! I was able to get if off of CDBABY!All the songs were very nice and uplifting! My personal two favorites were Our Time To Bless, Not About Us and Exceedingly, Abundantly! The rest were really nice too! I strongly recommend this album to all gospel lovers! Your're in for a great surprise!"
2,ok movie for figure skating fans,THIS MOVIE WAS NOT REAL GREAT BUT I LIKED IT BECAUSE I KNEW 2 OF THE KIDS THAT SKATED IN IT MORGAN AND EVAN.THEY SKATED PAIRS TOGETHER AT THE TOWER PLAZA ICE RINK IN PHOENIX WHITCH IS NOW CALLED ARCADIA ICE ARENA.THEY BROKE UP ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE MOVIE.EVAN WENT TO SKATE WITH SOMEONE ELSE. MORGAN WAS SEEMED SOO DEPPREST AFTER THAT SHE FINALY QUIT SKATING.IT WAS REALLY SAD.(SOUNDS LIKE A MOVIE).I KNOW SHE WANTED TO DO COMMERCALS SO MAYBE I WILL SEE HER SOMEDAY ON TV.GOOD LUCK MORGAN WHEREVER YOU ARE.
4,Even if I didn't love Eric Champion...,"I would love this project. The first time I heard Hot Christmas, I laughed until I almost cried and I still love it (since I live in Florida!) I've always liked creative and different. This project has it in spades. Love the arrangement of Little Drummer Boy and Angels We Have Heard on High. Christmas Kind of World gives me that all over glow that I associate with the Spirit of God moving at Christmas time as only He can. Now, even my kids can hardly wait for Christmas time to come so we can pull this out and listen to it.I wouldn't say it was Eric's best project, but it's definitely refreshingly different. In the vast sea of same old Christmas fare, this one absolutely stands out."
1,Shingle-Removing Fun For Squirrels!,"O yes, you get much more entertainment from this bird feeder than merely watching little brown birds squabble for a place at the trough. You get to watch squirrels pulling off the shingles. So just to give them more of a challenge, I used a staple gun to secure the shingles on the second feeder I purchased. And they did not disappoint! Off go the shingles! So many were pulled off that now just a tiny part of the top lifts off because the squirrels have separated it from the main body of the roof. O yes, what a wonderful way to entertain squirrels!"
2,Plastic and not durable,"Received this for Christmas year before last. Finally threw it away last fall. Plastic seed holder would not sit properly to let seed fall out onto the tray. The plastic cracked within a few months, the wood shingles on the roof separated and the whole thing became a mess to deal with. Into the garbage it went!"
4,An Informal approach to practical and effective Managers,"Tom Peter's casual style makes the reading of this book enjoyable, entertaining and provides useful tips that provide managerial tools to face different circumstances. The book brakes with the traditional format and provides a glimpse of younger and less formal managerial styles and their applications in real life in order to achieve one's objectives. Most of the ideas and suggestions are definitely applicable for both the domestic and international scenarios for managers of all ages."
2,Ill-Informed Observations,"While there are some good observations in the text, project focus, trust etc. There are also some very poor observations as well. Example: Kaizen and Six Sigma are an ""inadvertent obsession with polishing yesterday's paradigm"". What dribble. How can we hope to maintain our current customer loyalty if we don't strive to control our variability while we are tearing down old paradigms. Seeking to place blame for our lack of innovation is a direct response to poor management and reward and recognition systems inside our organizations. For this book to suggest and/or blame the lack of inovation in our organizations on continuous improvement and six sigma BREAKTHROUGH strategy is a not only incorrect, but dangerous."
4,Provokes you into thinking differently,"From the first page of the book 'till the last, you'll realize that Tom Peters (In Search of Excellence) is making you think differently. Pages are printed sideways, then normally, with extremely large type, then small type. Interspersed are ideas and facts that are thought provoking and sometimes, eye-opening. That's the point. Most of the ideas are applicable to building any type of successful business."
2,Didn't Age Well,"In 1997, it appears, Tom Peters took a bunch of his PowerPoint slides and made them into a book. More power to him for coming up with another revenue stream.From the vantage point of late 2001, Peters does not in the volume appear genuinely innovative but rather highly sensitive to trends that were forming at the time. Useful, but a different skill.For true vision, more content, and more explanation on the process of thinking creatively I recommend Faith Popcorn and Eric Maisel."
4,Not my favorite Peters book but it's useful information,"It's tough reading a book like this and not taking it for granted. Yes, it's almost 15 years old and the ideas seem quite pedestrian now but I have to remember, these ideas were mindblowing back in that day. Helping employees train to become more valuable, innovation minded teams, adding excitement to mundane products.. all of these ideas seem quite ""normal"" now but this book really started many managers and leaders on a new path to improvement. I do like his overall idea of not shrinking an organization for the short term gain when you must continue to make great products and services to be around for the long term. I've read many of Tom Peters books and this one is not the most innovative but it's a solid book and worth your time reading."
4,A different perspective of the future of the business world,"This is a thought provoking book. You get either excited about the way Tom Peters look at the world of business, or you could get anxious or just plain upset and furious.He talks about no rules, no strategy, no balance, one-man companies, all elements in the value chain are services, the death of the middle-man, no limits pleasing the customer, labels, labels, cv, talent, it's a woman's world, design is the next big thing, etc. In the end he summarizes his best advices and you better listen!You don't necessarily have to agree with everything he says, cause he will shake your foundations and make you think about if you are doing the right thing; both as an individual and if you are managing a company.It is the way he delivers his thoughts as well. This is not an ordinary textbook. It's full of pictures and TeXt splattered A-L-L o v e r the PAGES. It refuses to follow any standard structure. He seems to want to make a point or two..."
2,A few good thoughts but mainly just a lot of nonsense,The information could have been presented in a more organized and useable manner. Not really useful for most people.
4,Decent reading,"Don't be overwhelmed by the size of this book. You can go through it rather quickly since most of the pages have graphical text - big fonts and just like PPT presentations. If you are not used to or don't like graphics and presentations, you may have a hard time with this book (as you can see from other reviews). But it is kind of a breakthough book in terms of the style.Most of the ideas are very useful, most of the examples are very genuine in how it relates to the theory.For those who may be annoyed with the style of this book, my only request is, look beyond the style for the content or the gist."
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,"Tom Peters has finally surpassed himself. This is simply the best managment book I have read, seen or experienced. Yes, experienced. You can't just read it, you are drawn into it. The ideas from this book are changing our organization. But beware, I only give this book to people I like. I'm afraid to give it to competitors because they may put these principles in practice faster than I can! By the way, the book is even better the second time around. Thanks Tom for a work of art."
1,very poorly made,"Very ugly. Came with an ugly black mark on the top and when I tried to wipe it off, realized that it was under the shellac! I would definitely NEVER buy something like this again without seeing it. When I tried to return it, the co. was rude and condescending. I'll be donating mine to charity."
1,Very disapointed,"There was a damaged corner, a key was broken the tuner would not work and the equalizer had a short. This comes with picks and tuning wrench, did not need to buy additional. I would not buy this one again online as I got two that were broken."
2,Discolored bars,I ordered an 8 pack of the Basis All Clear bars. When I opened up the shipping box I noticed they were all discolored. I called the manufacturer and was told that I would receive something in the mail in order to return them. I had previously ordered 1 bar and it came with one free and both of them were not discolored.
1,"Discolored Basis ""Clear"" Soap Bars","My family has been using Basis Clear soap for years. When I found them on Amazon a few weeks ago I bought an ""8 Pack."" They were not shipped in an ""8 Pack"" but as individual bars. Every bar was discolored. I called the manufacturer. The rep wouldn't say why the bars were brown but they agreed to replace them all free of charge. And asked me to return two bars for analysis in their quality control department. I asked the rep if they were harmful to sensitive skin. She checked with someone and said they were not."
2,Antibacterial bar not ALL CLEAR,"Basis All Clear Bar (pack of 8) arrived from vendor yellowed with white edges even though use-by date is 10/2012. When purchased from a retail store, these bars are indeed clear with a mild lemon odor. But this vendor's bars are discolored & smell strongly. Bars do lather properly. Probably left out in the heat at some point. Maybe this vendor is reselling returned merchandise?"
2,Won't clear up acne,"I used to use proactive & prescription acne cream & my doctor told me that I should get an antibacterial soap for my face to help get rid of my acne. I saw the reviews on this site and bought this soap. I stopped using the proactive & my prescription face cream (which both stain my pjs and bedclothes & can get pricey & time consuming) and started using this soap (in the a.m. & p.m.) and my acne got worse. That was after about 1-2 weeks. Now it's been about 4-5 weeks. My acne is better but it's still slightly there and it doesn't look as good as it was when I used proactive & my prescription. I'm hoping that with time the soap will start working better. I have 7.5 bars left so I might as well use them. Anyway, don't expect this soap to clear up your acne right away. Then again, everybody's skin is different so who knows."

4,Pretty good,"Works pretty good. Takes a lot of work to get it all setup. Working with all the strings is the most challenging part. Have to make it stable enough, have enough drop to make it around the next turn, but have enough elevation on the turn so the marbles don't fly off. Also, the plastic clasps to hold the string don't work as the directions say.I bought this for my kids, but they are still too young. Probably need to be at least 8-9 years old and they need to have an interest and a lot of patience.Check out videos on YouTube to see how extravagent you can make these things...providing you have a wife that would actually allow you to take over a room with a marble track... :)"
5,Prometheus World Premiere,"Very interesting so far, very interesting and skittle frightening. What if this would really happen. Think about it! Watch the video and decide for yourself, if this were to be true."
4,Very good book for learning and consulting,"It's a very useful book for learning statistics focused on business. Based on a solid theory, it gives you many practical case studies. The approach is not superficial, but the beginners will find a safe path for improvement and for the comprehension of the subjects."
4,Flush Decks and Four Pipes,"John D. Alden is a retired U. S. Navt Commander with an eye for detail and the ability to make Naval history come alive.In his book ""Flush Decks and Four Pipes"", Mr. Alden examines the early class of U.S. destroyers known as 'four pipers' or 'four stackers'. He follows them from their inception in 1917 through all their service, including World War II. Not only that, Mr. Alden provides a record of each of the 273 four stackers (indexed by hull number and name), including its commissioning and decommissioning dates and its ultimate fate.The book is filled with black and white photographs and stories of particular four stackers, including illustrations of several that were overhauled or converted as time went by.This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in the old four piper destroyers. The only thing it lacks are some color plates which would help modelers and others to visualize paint schemes."
3,a good read for navy buffs,"My only problem with this book is that there is little about the engineering aspects. I had heard of some of the 4-piper quirks related to engineering, but there is little of this in the book."
5,Performed with real gusto!,"This recording of Schubert's two piano trios (the only two he wrote) is a real joy. Three masters of the trade provide a classy, lively, lyrical performance that is just full of enthusiasm and gusto (especially the B flat D898).I admit that I have not heard the two higher-priced recordings recommended by Gramophone, but I'd be very surprised if anyone could top this performance. This is one of my most frequently played CD sets -- for good reason. [I say much the same about the Mozart Piano Quartets recording on Naxos, for the same reasons.]"
5,Three of the Best in Complete Harmony,"The Schubert trios are wonderful pieces of chamber music, and very demanding. They require virtuoso skill and very close harmony among the players. Typically, the best recorded versions of chamber pieces are made by players who have played together for at least five years. Often the harmonious interaction of an experienced group makes up for what one or more of the players may lack in virtuosity.In this recording, three famous virtuosos play with such harmony that it seems that they must have played together for at least a decade. Delightful."
4,did you forget?,I had to return this CD because I wrote down the wrong D#? I'm sure it is lovely; great performers!KK
4,another solid cd from EIHT - 4.5 stars,"Since Eiht went to releasing his cd's independantly they have slacked a little (not to say they're bad, just not as good as he usually does)(except for ""Tha8t'z Gangsta"") but this album is a good one and his best since ""Tha8t'z Gangsta"", and a must have for Eiht fans. He has some tight production on here done by Eiht (3 songs) and Prodeje of South Central Cartel (1 song) with the rest being done by Tha Chill. It only features one person (CMW's Tha Chill) who is on 3 of the 12 songs. Definitely check this one out, has some good songs & beats and no real weak tracks (except maybe 1) as well as one classic and 2 near classics.#2 - 8.5#3 - 9#5 - 8 (f/ Tha Chill)#6 - 8.5#8 - 6.5#9 - 7 (slower song)#11 - 9 (f/ Tha Chill)#12 - 8.5 (f/ Tha Chill)#13 - 7.5#14 - 10 (classic w/ a great beat)#15 - 8#16 - 8b. Aaron Tyler ----- Compton, CACPT!!!!!check out all my reviews"
5,Another great book from Don Box,"This book is a must read for anyone who wants to go beyond the angle bracket rules in XML. As the preface states, this book presents XML from data-centric point of view. It is a dense read! It tremendously helped me in learning XPath, XML Schema, and XSLT. Another plus point is that this book is vendor neutral. It is focused on the technology rather than a particular vendor's implementation of XML parsers and tools."
2,Excellent book for the Mensa crowd,"If you enjoy cuddling up with sentences such as:""Element information items are fairly adaptable to representing arbitrary data structures, as one simply needs to build an isomorphism between the ""native"" data structure and a tree-oriented graph of elements and character data""... then you'll enjoy this book immensely. Me - I'm too stupid and life's too short."
1,Money back please!,"Essential XML commits the worst sin of any technical work: it assumes its readers are already familiar with the subject matter. Reading this book is is like joining a competitive high-level college course in mid-semester--one feels behind from the start.Perhaps the authors feel that readers who would admit to a need for a more gradual approach to the material are beneath their consideration as being weak technically. It's unfortunate that omniscience is one of the assumed attributes of the hacker.I for one am not omniscient, but prefer texts where the authors and editors have made a reasonable effort to present the material in a way accessible to readers with varying levels of prior expertise."
1,I wanted to like it...,"The problem with this book is that it is too abstract, not practical. In the 'real world' of software development, we need examples that apply.If you want to talk philosophy and examine odd insights, buy this book.If you want to really build XML solutions, don't."
5,"This is a 5 star book, no doubt about it!!","With all the lame-brained XML books available, this one truly stands out. It is not intended for the usual Wrox crowd, instead it is a book that is meant for the top-shelf!This is not a flavor of the month book. Buy it, read it, keep it, worship it!!!"
3,Good Book overall but not the best,"This is a pretty good book in terms of explaining XML. However, there are a couple of things you should note BEFORE buying the book.1. ALL examples are in JAVA. So if you are a JAVA programmer looking for an XML book you could consider this one. 2. The dialog is overly complex. the explainations of many basic XML concepts are overly complex and could be said in a easier to understand way.Just be prepared to have to re-read things a couple of time and say to yourself ""I cuold say that in such an easier way"".Overall..The book covers XML and does give you the essentials you need to grasp the technology"
2,"This is not the best Don Box, sorry","My impression is that Don Box is missing the mathematical bases to write this kind of ambitious books. There are big mistakes that show how he is missing a solid background on ""graph theory"" and mathematics. In my personal opinion he is a lot better writing about programming and should avoid this kind of topics."
2,A dud,"Trying to read it was a slow and painfull torture. I used to read IBM manuals in their glory mainframe days, so I am used to suffering. It reads like another pseudo scientific manifesto from the Developmentor group."
1,"Don Box , please stop!","Like all the stuff Don Box wrote and published, this book is yetanother product he put out in a hurry. there are many many manyblunt errors which makes you doubt if Mr. Box understandthe topic at all. we have our copy of this book (bought by mistake) in the lunch room so that we can use its pages to cleanspilled food. the cover of the book is anoying too! Don, is that you getting out the shower?in summary, what a piece of junk!"
3,Misleading title,"I agree with one of previous posters that the book should have been called ""The XML Infoset"". I grabbed this book because I was really happy with two other books by Don Box and people from DevelopMentor (""Essential COM"" and ""Effective COM""). I don't use much of XML in my daily work and wanted to have a comprehensive book covering the technology. Unfortunately, it just concentrated on some XML topics, assuming the reader has already understood XML fairly well."
2,No where near Don's earlier books.....,"I was one of the few people who brought the book first. And I am sorry to say that this was a big disappointment. I was not able to figure out what was the problem with this book. I was very surprised that it was no where Don Box's earlier books, which is in my shelf of classic books. I was not able to complete the first few chapter of this book(very boring). I really don't know what is the reason. If you want to know about XML dont by this book. You can refer to w3x.com, microsoft website to get more info. Or atleast XML by Example. May be DB was not able to deliver the killer book unlike the earlier ones because XML has not the critical mass like COM."
1,Box bombs again.,"I thought the follow on to the Essential COM (which is OK) called ""Effective COM"" was cheesy and a rip-off ... until I got this book! Waste of mindspace - XML is changing and morphing too fast for this type of diatribe - save it for MSDN Magazine so we can skip the nonsense and get onto meaningful information. I hope DevelopMentor isn't using this for it's $2395.00 course - yikes!"
2,Hard to read.,"The book is very hard to read, because of author style and subject matter. It starts to get more interesting after the first chapter. Plenty of examples if you are into java."
2,"""When Don Box Attacks"" part 3","This book (after Essential COM and Effective COM) is another tour de force of the author's arrogant, high blood-pressure writing style.Less attitude and more insight beyond what's in the specs would make this book worthwhile.All the material this book covers is excellently covered by freely available white papers/tutorials at w3.org and msdn.microsoft.com/xml."
2,Difficult to make it through the first 75 pages,"I bought the book because of Don Box's name, but found it to be very dry. I returned the book within the first 30 days."
3,Pretty dense...,"If you are looking to this book to give you the same knowledge about XML that Essential COM gave you about COM, you are likely to be dissappointed.Like Essential COM, this is an extremely dense book and there are rewards to be found for your efforts. However, the struggle is much harder in this book and the rewards are fewer. The prose is even more stilted and obscure. It is really a poorly written book.Still, if you like mining for insights you might find some in this book. The insights gained, however, will be more at the high level conceptual than the low-level usage area (unlike Essential COM). If you like spoon feeding you'd better stay away completely."
5,Awesome bag,"Bought this from Amazon back in 2007 and though I would wait a couple months after using before submitting a review. 6 years later I finally remembered and I also still use this very same bag and its in great shape. It's very comfortable, extremely light and as a major hiker it's extremely small and easy to pack which I love. Once I need a replacement, which won't be soon, it will be another one of these hands down."
4,"They just played ""Mistletoe and Wine"" on the radio.","Being from the US, I'm not that familiar with Cliff Richard, although I understand he's a big star in the UK. A friend gave this CD to me because she liked his song ""Christmas is Quiet"". The back of the CD says that it ""includes 8 new recordings and 9 of your Christmas favourites from Cliff"". Actually, none of these songs are my ""favourites"", since I never heard them before, but I have grown to like them. This is a very good Christmas album, with a good mix of traditional Christmas songs and new ones."
4,Good addition to collection,"Most songs are good. Little Town, Saviour's Day and Mistletoe and Wine are GREAT!!!Other classic Christmas songs are better left for the original singers"
2,... before being sold !,"I was really pleased with this album , however, 2 tracks had severe glitches.The last track 'The millennium Prayer' which is the reason I purchased this , was one of the glitched songs...I would like to think that merchandise was thoroughly listened to before being sold.... that being said , I will return this specific disc and order another one :)"
4,Good songs,"Good songs. WOW Worship series is awesome. If you like the song list, you can't go wrong with the CD."
1,Biased,"This seemingly innocuous book still graces the shelves of my church library, much to my dismay. I picked it up when I was 11 and found it fundamentally biased. Ostensibly addressed to both women and men, it placed the responsibility of a sexually pure life entirely on the shoulders of women, using incentives such as keeping her reputation sound and not losing her boyfriend because he might think she's a slut if they sleep together. He also encourages men to go as far as they want with a woman, promoting it as a way to find out how easy she really is. In the last sections of the book he even admits his bias, doesn't even try to hide or excuse it. I would never give this book to one of my children. It's an amazing example of everything that's wrong with gender conceptions in America today."
5,Great Light Read,"I enjoyed this book! It was fun, light, but still wasn't your typical fluffy ""chick"" book. A great author that I am going to investigate more."
5,Why Can't all RDI books be like Bombshell?,"I just don't understand why all Red Dress Ink Book be like ""Bombshell"" Good! This was the first book that I read from Lynda Curnyn and I really liked it.At thirty-four Grace Noonan is still looking for Mr. Right and if that was not enough to deal with there have been a major sake up at cosmetic company that she works at. Instead the over-forty market that have been there bread and butter, they are going after the under twenty set.This was a great book that left the reader with hope for not only Grace but themshelves. I just hope that all RDI Books are as good as ""Bombshell"" and those early year bad reads are done with."
3,An undiscovered gem!,"Nice light read for summer. This book has a lot more to offer than your average ""chick-lit"" book. Unpredictable and funny, and also sensitively examines the difficult subject of adopted children's struggles to come to terms with their birth mothers' giving them up, mourning the death of a birth mother the heroine never knew, etc. A mature chick-lit novel for the 30+ crowd."
5,Love Grace as the Star!,"Grace Noonan is a 34 year old career girl who finds herself longing for ore than the stream of non-commital men in her life. She wants to be recognized for her talent at work. She wants to hear from her birth mother whom she recently found. She even finds herself wanting a baby. We follow Grace's antics in the cosmetic world and with a young colleague of her father's. Tom, even though a backwards professor, does something to her that she cannot explain - or resist.It's nice to read a book when you already know the characters, but you could easily pick this up without having read ""Engaging Men"" and enjoy it as Grace was only a minor character in that one. Grace is wonderful, with real reactions to everyday problems. I like that the book ends without tying-up every loose end - it shows that the point is to be happy with yourself and for yourself and let things fall as they may. A sequel should be done because I didn't want to leave her!"
4,An easy read,"I read ""Engaging Men"" and was happy to hear that the author would do a follow-up for Grace. ""Bombshell"" is a good, easy read. The ending was realistic, not the typical fairy tale ending. Could there possibly be a 3rd book? Let's hope so."
5,Couldn't get enough of it!,"I couldn't get enough of this novel. I enjoyed reading it very much. I was not able to put it down.Grace Noonan is a likeable character that goes through some rough times; she manages to work things out in spite of some painful events that take place in her life.She finds love at a time when she least expected it. She was close to almost giving up on her love life.Ultimately, I must say that this novel is entertaining, modern, and realistic. I truly recommend it."
2,A Disappointment,This toy is very boring she can not bend and she slumps. The stand is a waste of plastic and her cloak... awfulIf you intend to play with this toy look elsewhere and save money
3,"an enormous amount of interesting, useful information",". . .the first fourteen chapters. . .gather in one place an enormous amount of interesting, useful information about (deceased) lexicographers and the dictionaries they prepared.as reviewed by Laurence Urdang in the Winter 1997 issue (Vol. XXIII, No. 3) of VERBATIM, The Language Quarterly."
3,Apparent best choice in US for a steam generator,"Coming from across the Atlantic ocean, we were used to having our choice of lots of different types of steam generator irons. Once you use one, you can't go back to just a regular steam iron. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be that many choices in the US for people such as us that have seen the light. This Euro Pro Shark steam station is a fairly low priced yet sufficiently capable product to satisfy our needs. It was not easy to find and it does have a couple of disadvantages relative to what we were used to. For one, it's got less power and generates less steam than the iron we used to have overseas. The second down side is that you can't lock the steam button and you have to hold it for as long as you want to produce steam. Finger gets tired after a while. Other than that, it's sufficiently small, low priced and good enough product."
2,The older model was the better iron,"I bought a EuroPro steam iron about 3 years ago, I am still using it and I like it very much. I recently bought this ""Euro Pro Shark Steam Station"", I don't like it as much. The tank holds the water is much smaller then the older model. I have to wait for the steam after I use it for a while, but not the older model which I never need to wait for the steam. Jerry"
3,Beware of aliens bearing gifts!,"This story was the first script produced from the pens of Bob Baker and Dave Martin, who went on to create K9 many years later. It is adapted by Doctor Who's script editor of the time, Terrance Dicks.In many respects, 'The Claws of Axos' is an archetypal third Doctor and UNIT story. It contains all the classic elements: a possible threat which turns out to be more than meets the eye, officials who cause more harm than good due to their own self-importance, the stalwarts UNIT troops disarmed by the regular army, and the Doctor several steps ahead of everyone.The substantial difference from this standard story is that the aliens, the Axons, offer humanity a gift - the miracle element, Axonite, which could help solve humanity's problems.Not bad, but also not particularly good. Possibly more enjoyable as a video."
4,Corn Cob Feeder A Hit With The Squirrels,Squirrels love the corn cob feeder! The only problem is our two dalmations are going crazy because they want to go out and play with them. Our yard is full of the furry tailed animals. Get one and see for yourself.
4,It is a nice Rice cooker,"It looks very nice, functions like any other rice cooker with an added advantage of the vegetable steamer. But the name of ""24-cup"" is misleading as it cooks 24-cup cooked rice.Normally, the standard is to use the number of cups of uncooked rice for measurement to indicate the capacity of the Rice cooker."
2,"Good rice, but unreliable product: Keep your receipt!","I agree with most of the other reviews in that the rice is good when it gets cooked. However, this product is unreliable. The ""Cook"" button frequently pops up to ""Warm"" before the rice has finished cooking. Also, if you leave the rice on the ""Warm"" option for more than an hour or so, the rice on the bottom will burn. I cook rice appx twice a week and have had this machine for nearly 5 months - it just stopped working the other day with no obvious cause. I called the warranty hotline number and was informed that the problem is usually with the detachable power cord. Luckily I still have the receipt and this happened within the 1-yr warranty period, so they will replace it for me."
4,Easy to use,"I've had this for almost two months now, and we eat rice usually about twice a week. It works well. I make a mixture of brown and white rice, and the cooker has handled that well. The instructions are minimal, so you'll have to do some experimenting. One downside is that the rice isn't really done until the cooker has switched from ""cook"" to ""warm"" and been on ""warm"" for at least 15 minutes, but if you've walked off and left it you don't know how long it's been on warm. The instructions give no cooking times, so you'll have to watch it for a time or two to get a feel for how long it will take to cook. I've also used it to steam vegetables successfully, but the space to hold vegetables is not very big, holding perhaps four cups."
2,No results yet,"I have not noticed any change in my body fat like I was hoping. I got the idea from a Dr. Oz article I read saying it will reduce your body fat, Montel Williams claims to use it with great results. Maybe it's different for women? I don't know but I won't reorder more when I am done if I do not notice the change don't need th added expense in my budget for nothing."
1,doesn't work,"didn't help me lose any weight, even with an intense workout routine, wouldn't recommend buying for weight loss, waste of money"
1,Tonal in,Did not see any difference so I will not order it again. I did not see the results I was looking for.
2,I can't tell if these work or not,"I've used an entire bottle of the CLA and I don't know if they actually work. I definitely haven't lost weight, but haven't really gained much either. Who knows if these are keeping me from doing either. I have another bottle I am using, but I dont think I will continue after that bottle is gone because of the unknown results.I cannot say I recommend these, nor would I recommend to a friend."
5,I do beleive it is working,"Have been taking these for a while now and have noticed some what of a change in fat position on my body, that I was unable to achieve before using these. Mainly the most noticeable area is around my oblique areas, just seems to be less fatty. I am also exercising and dieting which I am sure has a lot to do with it, but was not able to get the results until starting to use these.I will try and take some comparison photos to show the size of these pills in the next few days.Overall I would recommend these."
1,1000 mg it is NOT!,When the bottle has a big number 1000 on it you could be excused for thinking each capsule contains 100 mg of CLA----and you would be wrong. The fine print says 2200 mg CLA in 3 pills. WTF?
1,Nothing happened at all.,"Nothing, zip. Took 114 1000 mg (proper) pills and...nothing. Shrug. I figured I'd try it before I tried a more aggressive diet pill, but it didn't affect me in any way whatsoever."
1,has not been effective for me,"this product has not been effective for me. I can tell absolutely no differance in hunger. I do feel jitters when taking the product. This pill is like so many other products that I have in my medicine cabinet that promises hope for weight loss, but produces none."
2,Misleading,"Advertised as 1000mg, when indeed you have to take 3 pills to achieve the recommended dosage of 1000mg. So, the 120 pills that are in the container will only give you 40 doses. Very misleading when it clearly says on the bottle 1000 CLA. Then, if you are taking it 3 times per day as recommended, the bottle only lasts for 2 weeks. Next time I will buy in the store, so I know what I am buying."
2,CLA dosage misleading,"I was excited at first to see 1000mg CLA pills because that is hard to find at this price. They didn't list the dosage so I assumed that was per pill, not!!! It was per dose. This made me mad because the price, based on the dosage, was horrible! I had to take so many of them in each of my stacks that the bottle didn't last long. I got a better deal at walmart.CLA is an awesome supplement just don't get mislead. If dosage information is not shown, don't buy it!"
3,tonalin 1000 cla,dont get me wrong cla's are a great supplement but when i bought these i thought because of the name that they were 1000mg pills but ended up being only 750mg. by doing this they are making this cla very expensive.
5,Love it!,"I love Enya, and this karaoke disc is the best I've heard. The music sounds almost identical to her songs. The vocal side of it, of course is not the best, being as it's not Enya. But if you don't know the songs by heart, singing along with the vocals really helps. I highly recommend this for any karaoke fan!"
4,Pretty nice.,"It does the job on keeping your PSP safe while also leaving all ports clear of obstruction. Nice large screen guard (that does scratch pretty easily, its only soft plastic.) The case is aluminium but feels like steel. Thing weighs a ton with the PSP in there which is my only complaint. Big, Bulky and heavy which is not the way i would like my PSP in my pocket.Tried the Pelican screen cover/case, but its defective from the factory, screws dont reach the threads on the PSP. Real nice peice of junk that one is, the search continues for a slim light PSP protector."
3,NOT THAT GOOD,THIS CASE FOR THE PSP ISNOT VERY PROTECTIVE. THE CHEAP PLASTIC SCREEN PRO. WILL SCRATH YOUR PSP SCREEN. I GOT MY FIRST SCRATH FROM THIS. ALSO YOU CAN BEND THIS CASE WITH YOUR HANDS . IT IS NOT DESTRUCTTABLE.
3,STEALTH CASE,"THE CASE IN IT'S SELF IS PRETTY COOL LOOKING, SOMTHING DIFFRENT THAT NOT EVERYBODY HAS. I HAVE THE PSP 3000 AND THE HEADPHONE JACK IS COVERED SO THAT SUCKS! IT IS RATHER PRICEY FOR WHAT IT IS BUT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE THIS THAT I SAW. ALSO, IT SEAMS AS THOUGH THIS CASE IS MADE OUT OF ALUMINUM SO IT CAN GET BENT OUT OF SAPE WHICH CAN BE GOOD AND BAD AT THE SAME TIME. GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN BEND IT SO THAT IT CAN SEAL BETTER BUT BAD BECAUSE IF LEFT EMPTY YOUR BABY BOTHER CAN SIT ON IT AND DEFORM THE CASE"
5,"the album is fantastic, I give cherelle 10 stars!","I've enjoyed everything, that she has come out with. But my favorite is her fragile album!!!. It came out in I geuss late 80's, I have been searching high and low for that! particular album, if anyone knows how I can obtain that cassette/c.d. please, please! let me know.. thanks so very much for your help out there."
4,"Concise, not a textbook style book","Some of the concepts were new to me and some were not. The old ideas were the ones that I came across in a first Java programming course or in a discrete-event simulation course. Book is easy to read, concise, not a textbook. Useful for someone that has not studied anything about discrete-event simulation."
2,"Bonnie Tyler CD ""Collections""","I like Bonnie Tyler very much.I was unhappy with the CD condition.I bought it and the write up said it was ""like new "" quality.It has a small defect on it and gets hung up. It has a hard time moving onto it's next song line.The disc is not scratched but has a dot/smug area that prevents it from playing smoothly. I tried cleaning it but it didn't help.The albums song collections are very good.I esp. like the song ""Holding out for a Hero.""Great song for spinning or jogging to.~Jane"
4,Even Though She Makes My Throat Hurt...,"...she still is great to listen to. This greatest hits collection really showcases some of her finest moments. Her version of ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain"" is my favorite. It has such drive! Jim Steinmann was as perfect man to handle Ms. Tyler's raspy, but expressive, voice. I remember when ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" came out, how impressive both the single and the video were! Ah, those were the days! And, fans, wasn't Nicki French's ""disco"" remake a hoot? Long live the ORIGINAL of that song!"
1,Super Star.....One Hit,"Bonnie Tyler was of the best of her genre, the compilation on this album just does not get any worst. I gave this album one star and that's because it only has one song that you can actually listen to without wanting a refund, and that is none other than `Total eclipse of the heart' the best song of her career. For people who don't know who Bonnie Tyler is, when listen to this album she sounds like a one hit wonder. Very disappointing."
5,I love this album!,"This is great! I bought it for ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" and ""Holding Out for a Hero."" I then listened to ""Ravishing,"" ""Take me Back,"" and ""Rebel Without a Clue."" I am so mad that my CD got scratched; I knew I should have purchased it on cassette! It is one of my favourite albums!Thanks"
2,Super Hits ?,Where is It's A Heartache ? Bonnie only had 2 or 3 hits and one of the biggest isn't on Super Hits. If you are buying a hits cd it should contain hits. This cd should be labeled One Hit & Filler.Don't buy this one it's a ripoff.
4,Good buy to meet Bonnie...,"I like this album because all the songs are album version (long version). This has a good price especially considering running time is about 60 min. I should admit, of course, that this would have been a lot better if ""It's a heartache"" had been included. However, I am enjoying this album with no problem anyway."
2,Not much fun,"Bonnie Tyler albums generally have a handful of fast songs that become hits mixed with slower numbers to even the pace out. This CD, of course, only has the hits. Mixed up with other material, they're kind of fun. One after another, they're pretty scary. ""Faster than the speed of night"", for instance, is positively nuts. The pianist sounds like Madame Sousatzka has a gun to his head and the guitarist (Rick Derringer, I think) sounds like he's being electrocuted. I was half expecting to see something in the liner notes explaining that the backup singers are now street mimes. My recommendation: buy it, rip it, and make a new CD that alternates Bonnie Tyler tracks with Yanni tracks."
4,"Great, easy to use camcorder!","I purchased this camcorder for its small size, ease of use and ease of uploading video to the internet for family. I have been very satisfied. It is small enough to fit into a coat pocket or purse without having to lug around a large camera bag. It is perfect for recording the events of three active children. It is so easy to load the video onto the internet for family to enjoy who live away from us. I was not very sure what to expect with the low price of the camera, but have been pleasantly surprised. It is a very affordable camera for a busy, active family."
3,Good Enough,"Found this product to be very handy. Although the video resolution is below my expection, it's good enough for viewing in my computer."
3,Money's worth,"Were I to market a lovely high tech product, I should write instructions user-friendly to those unfamiliar with multiple cords, ports, and so on."
3,camera SDR S10,"I bought the camera. I like its dimensions, easy usage and taking videoclips on a SD memory card. I have just a very big problem. The included software doesnt work properly. My computer is able to show the camera and card either. Unfortunatelly the motionSD studio software always sais that ""there is nothing recorder, however a clips have been taken..."
3,"Alright, but not great","So far, the main complaint that I have is that there is no lens cap. I cant imagine Panasonic did not come up with this. This is a small one, easy to carry around, which probably is the reason it is getting a lot of smudges on the lens all the time."
2,Disappointing,"The software may be good for beginners but intermediate and advanced learners will be disappointed. The basic and intermediate sections are very basic, though the extended features has some items of interest. The constant English audio instructions (no option to switch to French) are useful once, but annoying afterwards.Technically, the software runs slow and the voice recognition feature is cumbersome and buggy. Not the best product available by far."
5,sounds great on my banjo,"These picks are great- they bend easily so you mold them to your finger, but aren't fragile and I haven't had one snap on me. They make a great noise on my banjo and have saved me from killing my finger nails.They are snug and take some getting used to- but there's no getting around that with any finger pick."
1,"Nothing good to say except: ""They're shiny!""","This review is targeted towards fingerstyle guitar players that are looking for an alternative to their fingernails to play rock, alternative, Spanish, or classical music on an acoustic guitar with metal strings. Don't buy these picks.I was hoping metal picks would be a simple and durable alternative to maintaining fingernails that can easily break. These picks look great in the box but once on your fingers, you lose all the touch and some of the tone your fingernails provide. After you get used to the feel of a foreign body on your fingertips, plucking the thicker strings (6E, 5A, 4D) sound fine. However, using these picks on the thinner strings (3G, 2B, 1E) adds a horrible metal scratching sound to the plucks (very noticeable particularly when playing quieter notes) - unacceptable.I'm going to stick with using fingernails to play - I suggest you do the same."
2,"great, but not so much","while i love the idea of a working stet for a toddler, i would have to say there is another one that i ordered at the same time that worked better-- mostly louder. This one came in pieces and i think assembling it at home made it a poor product. however i would have to say my kid still loved it!"
4,If you're a tool use this bag and you'll be cool!,"It's a large pouch of thin but tough artificial fabric. The camo pattern imparts a he-man vibe so any dude wouldn't be ashamed to grip it in public. It's just the right size to store my Rode stereo mic and cables, keeping them from getting lost or entangled in the mass of wires and gadgets in my gear bag. Think I'll buy a couple more in different colors. Sure beats using plastic bags or nuttin'!"
4,Great little on-the-go copier,"I've been using this copier for about 5 years. Starter cartridge yields about 50% output. Replacement cartridge lasts quite a while. Bought a large Storm case (similar to Pelican) for it, and I take it to the shooting range with me to run some copies for each class I teach. Never any problems. A fellow instructor has a PC 140 that he's been using even longer without any problems. Only drawback so far: the feed and collection trays are a bit fragile."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This printer is wonderful. I haven't one negative remark concerning the functionality of the machine. I am warning about this purchase because to replace the cartridge is $85 upwards. Obviously, half the price of the ""copier"" is the ""cartridge enclosed."""
4,great copier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Got this copier for the in-laws to copier medical bills for medicare. They hate computers. So spending a 1000 dollars on system they won't use didn't make sense. It's simple to use and have only the basic functions. The ink cartidge is good for 2000 pages which will last longer than my in-laws will live. The cartidge cost almost as much as the copier itself.All in all a good basic copier for people who are computer haters.
4,Daddy's not Amish,"A wonderful book. Even if you aren't a rich cable havin geek, you can at least appreciate the genius of these two men. This book is most interesting when it discusses L.A.'s alternative comedy scene. I guess these two exemplify(sic)belly laughs without the yuk yuk shave your chest yakov smirnov hullabaloo."
3,Scammy flammy mammy!,"It's way too soon for a book about Mr Show. It only finished, what, 4 years ago? And there's nothing about WHY they finished, or what they did after the show (Run Ronnie Run etc). I would also like to read something a little more detailed about that BIZARRE fake newscast from the ""Best Of Season 3"" episode. Maybe in 10 or 20 years, someone can write a true history of this great show, along with its impact on subsequent comedy (which is still, at this point, comedy to come).If you are saving your pennies, wait for the DVD of season 3 coming out in August. Otherwise, if you're like me, you'll want this book no matter how sucky it is."
1,Are You Kidding Me!!,"First of all the author needs to buy a dictionary and a spellcheck. I don't enjoy writing bad reviews ...but I am sorry. A waste of my time reading it. Recommended reading:Another Day in Paradise, Slaughter House Five, Nine-O Adam, Junky, Blue Blood."
2,"Some decent quotes, not much more","This book was OK. The book has the following components:1. Short Biographies of the people involved in the show2. A bunch of quotes about the Writing/Production Process of the show3. An episode guide featuring paragraph summaries of every sketch in every episode.The last component makes up the bulk of the book. I'm not sure what use these are and I skipped over these summaries.All in all there isn't enough material for a book. The fact that it's written by the wife of one of the main creators probably meant she was kind to the people involved and didn't want to include any juicy stories or any real drama. So the book is a pretty superficial treatment of what it was like to work on the show. Some anecdotes are amusing, and its not that I didn't enjoy reading it (its easily digestible for sure), only its not worth the money, and doesn't really offer any real insight into the process of working on a comedy show in general, or this show in particular."
4,Great Flashlight!!,I love these flashlights. These are good for gifts as you never know when an emergency situation will come up and you need a flashlight. This would be a 6 star item if the switch button as stated by the other reviewer would not be so easy to switch to the siren by accident. The radio sounds great the lights are bright and just right. I can't complain. I think every household could benefit from having a few of these.
1,El Stinko,I got this to listen to the NOAA station and can just barely hear it after spending a lengthy period of time trying to tune the rascal.
3,Cat likes it more than baby,"This works as described but makes an unpleasant noise when the vibration function is turned on. Fortunately, the baby doesn't seem to care one way or the other about the vibration, so I don't use it. The seat is a big hit with my cat, as seen in the photo."
3,IT worked ok.,"But this thing is uncomfortable, it has a plastic piece that you ""clip"" to your nostrils. But i didnt want to spend any more money for my costume so i let it slide for the night. I would definitely buy something else if i needed another one."
5,True Love at last...,"Stop! Don't date without listening to these tapes! A friend once told me that the potentially singlemost important decision you could make in your lifetime is who you decide to marry. I am single, never been married and I am so glad I was fortunate enough to be able to be exposed to ""All the Love You Could Ever Want"" prior to embarking on my marriage journey. Listening to them has literally reshaped my experience in how I approach dating as a result. I used to be so disillusioned about relationships, having been disappointed time after time. The deeply sincere and uplifting content of the Peck's tapes has rescued me from harmful patterns and quite possibly years of repeat history. They lay down their experience with such openly original and fresh inspiration it can melt the most cynical and wounded of hearts. What both an incredible ally and invaluable resource companion ""All the Love You Could Ever Want"" will become for you."
1,Buyers Beware,"I purchased two Ultravox CDs from Amazon recently- ""Systems of Romance"" and ""Ha-Ha-Ha"". Both were described in the product details as being ""Japanese Limited Edition 2008 Remasters"". As many know, the quality of Japanese cds are often superior to domestic, including alternative packaging and liner notes. Some Ultravox discs Amazon are listing are common midpriced E.U. discs and NOT Japanese. The first UV cd is also advertised as such, but my guess is it's also bogus. ""Ha-Ha-Ha"" was purchased from CAIMAN, ""SoR"" from MovieMars. This is consumer fraud and a waste of their customers time while having to return them."
1,Ha Ha Ha... joke is on who?,"what is this? does John Fox know how to sing- because he sure can't sing properly on this recording. Listen to ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" for my evidence of this (the Church did a MUCH superior cover of this song recently). Even Ultravox's Top of the Pops appearance is more favorable than this recording.Although this version of the band moves away from the ""pop-new wave"" of the time, recordings should still be well-produced, and singers should stay in key, not add wierd distracting inflections, etc. I have all respect for artists who branch away from the norm, unless they produce annoying music and expect me to call it ""art""."
4,An under-appreciated classic of punk-glam new wave,"I used to listen to a friend's copy of this album back around when it came out, but I had forgotten how excellent most of it is.This is Ultravox when they were just starting out, and although the Roxy Music & Eno influences are heavily apparent, the snotty energy of the punk movement is what makes this album blast out of the speakers. It's in a similar vein to the first Gary Numan album, a sort of computerized glam-punk.I would highly recommend Ha-Ha-Ha to fans of Roxy Music, Eno, Gary Numan, the Buzzcocks, David Bowie and classic new wave. It should also appeal to fans of newer bands like Interpol, stellastarr*, the Stokes, Elefant, the Rapture, TV on the Radio, etc etc...."
5,LOSS OF A MARRIAGE-(IN THIS VERY HOUR),"I WISH I'D READ THIS BOOK MANY YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS GOING THROUGH A PAINFUL DIVORCE. B.J. WROTE ABOUT HER OWN EXPERIENCES AND HOW SHE COPED WITH THEM BY RELYING ON HER FAITH IN GOD. SHE THEN RELATES THEM TO THE READER IN WORDS THAT ONE COULD EASILY UNDERSTAND. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY YOUNG MOTHER WHO IS FACED WITH THE ""LOSS OF A MARRIAGE""."
1,"Been there, read that.",Is there an original thought in this book at all? From the cover design to the actual content all I see are examples of other peoples work. Instead of regurgitating known and practiced hiring models why don't you actually develop your own ideas? Uh? Then once you actually test and prove them for YEARS you can claim to be an expert and write a book.
1,Awful,"Mr. Parsley, what you've written is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever read. At no point in your rambling, incoherent musings were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Anyone who has read this book is now dumber for having read to it. May God have mercy on your soul."
2,"Great idea, but I can't stand mine","I have 2 of these, and it really is a wonderful idea to have all your spices in one spot on a carousel with 3 different ways to dispense them.<br /><br />But I do find it a pain to keep clean, especially the top part of the carousel where you see the handle in the picture, and in and around the dials. It constantly looks dirty.<br /><br />Plus some of the lids snap tighter than others, and a few of the lids have snapped right off completely. I'm not thoroughly convinced it's keeping my spices as fresh as could be- considering I need to hack away at the onion and garlic powders with a butter knife when I need to use them because they have turned into a solid block inside the container.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am currently looking for another spice rack."
5,Be amazed ... and go see the movie afterwards !,"If you love Nepal, Tibet and it's beautifull people, you'll love this book. The stunning pictures tell a great story. About the people in the Dolpho region. They trade salt against food. But to do so, they have to travel hard miles trough a stunning but barren country, with incredible moutains, lakes and of course a caravan of yaks. The author lived with these people and you'll see in his picture the love he has for this region. He knows how to tell a story and how to make the picture to encounter the beauty of it.The movie CARAVAN tells the same story but then the pictures move (haha) As you can read I'm not used to write in English, but my message is this one ... buy it and go see the picture, you won't be disapointed !"
1,Eugene O'Neill is turning over in his grave,"Last year, I was the sponsor for a literary criticism group and the play The Hairy Ape was on the list. Since I like the students to delve into the literature in a variety of ways, I purchased the film. It is TERRIBLE, veering completely from the script of the play. The only time I enjoyed it was the few minutes that I fell asleep as my students and I sat around the fire watching it."
3,The Hairy Ape/DVD,Old movie I saw when 12-13 & still remembered. Was pleased to be able to see it again.Did not make the same impression this time but still moving.Product is good quality.
1,Minimal Macintosh support,"If you are a Mac user you will not be able to syncronise your contacts easily. In fact, it's a royal pain, but it can be done.[...]You can use bluetooth to transfer files to the phone, but to get files off the phone, you must send them one by one from the phone itself.This is extremely disappointing, because the rest of the interface of the phone is really quite passable.Samsung gets kudos for a cool looking phone, but looses marks carrying into the negative for not including decent software support for the Mac.Most disappointing indeed."
3,"Overall good, but the camera is disapponting.","My biggest disappointment is the built-in 3 Mpix camera. Images are almost always out of focus and blurred - no matter the lighting conditions, or which settings you are using. Viewing and scrolling through previous pictures is also very, very slow, especially if the pictures are stored on the memory card. The camera is fine for occasional and spontaneous pictures, but I guess I was hoping for something more.On the other hand, the user interface is great and the phone is packed with features. However, I have to say that most of these features (although cool) are of little use to me (for instance, conversation recording). The features that I do use, instead, are also found in older versions of this phone, such as the Samsung t629 which only costs $150 from T-Mobile.Therefore, overall, I'm not sure whether this phone is worth its sticker price.The package came with a USB cable and headsets."
1,"Bought two, both defective for Cingular","Phone went through power cycles when I pushed the send button trying to call people. Not worth the time or money. I currently own and have owned the Samsung D807, and I sm happy to have reverted back to it. FYI , i ordered two of these phones, D900, and they both were defective when pushing the send button. I currently have Cingular and it could be my network, however i don't care. I am glad the retailers returned this for me. Good luck!"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK,"This book is wonderful, well organized, and full of things to go back to. Well worth the price for my Kindle Fire. LOVE IT!!!"
1,don't use below 55F,"I bought this bag a year and a half ago because for the price it had excellent weight and pack size. I've used it now about a dozen times, and I hate it. I was hoping for a 3 season bag I could use in cooler days, but when the temperature drops below 60f, the bag is just cold (and believe me, I'm warm when other people are cold). I should have realize as soon as I got the bag that it wouldn't stand to cool weather, since it has no loft. Unfortunately, there's no national standard regulating sleeping bag ratings, so manufacturers can basically write whatever they want. And here Slumberjack/Eureka were a little too greedy.If you use the bag over 60F, it's fine. However, the inside lining is very fragile, and already caught on the zipper and tore a bit. On a positive note, the zipper at the bottom allows you to regulate your body temperature in warmer days.But then, if you want a summer bag, why not spend an extra $30 or so and get one from any of the higher-quality manufacturers?"
1,Celine Dion is slipping,"Celine is like my favorite singer. Normally I like everything she does, but this album just sucks. As I recall she said if she could not top her last album she would not realse one, well she did. She's not reaching her full potential as an artist and if she keeps this up, she going to be out like yesterday's trash."
1,She calls this a miracle?,"Some old fart blows his beans up her muff and the end result is a 'miracle'? Give me a break. If that's a miracle, so is taking a dump...which is pretty much equivalent to the entire recorded output of this overmarketed, overrated, so-full-of-herself commercial twit."
2,An alternative to Celine...,"I love Celine, but her music hasn't been all that of late. I wish she would record a rock album! Her duet with Anastacia on Divas was sensational...All you Celine fans, should check out an Aussie alternative!! COSIMA DEVITO. She was a finalist on AUSTRALIAN IDOL a 2/3 years ago. She got to the final 3 but had to leave due to throat nodules. Anyway, she couldn't get a solid record deal afterwards so she started her own company and DIANNE WARREN wrote and produced her ENTIRE first album. She has been compared to Celine but with an edgier sound! And true that is...check out this diva!!! http://www.cosima.net.au/"
1,Excellent!,Je pense que Celine Dion doit chantez des chansons de Gerry Boulet alors je mange un pamplemousse!
1,Over Fluffy baby moblie songs,Horrible. This CD's tracks should be used to play tunes for a baby's mobile. Someone should tell her not to stick her kid in places he doesn't belong.
1,Blah,"Lullabys to drive you insane, put you into a coma. This music is boring and bland. First a so so studio CD (One Heart), then a junky Live CD, a lullabys CD, next a French CD, this singer puts out more material then Carter makes liver pills. How about make a WORTHWHILE CD with high quality written songs and continue your career where A New Day left off? Keep putting out junk CDs one after the other and nobody might care in the coming years. Time to team back up with Jim Steinman or a worthy song writer and make something GOOOOOD! 3 years, 3 bad CDs. Maybe next a box set, Live Volume 2, Lullabys Volume 2, what else?"
1,Totally Tasteless,"How much more can this woman sell out?Chrysler commercials, tacky Vegas act and now Anne Geddes?!?!Celine has zero credibility in the music industry. What's next? McDonald's commercials or ""Eat At Joe's"" plastered to her back?"
5,Best CD ever!,I bought this CD when I was pregnant and played it on my belly for 9 months. It is the absolute best lullaby CD I have ever heard. Highly recommend.
5,"Was skeptical, but very impressed","After regretting my purchase of Celine's Live album, I thought she was in a rut with some of the music she was putting out, but I'm relieved that I bought this cd now because its a nice return to excellence for her. Celine's rendition of Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy"" is worth buying this cd. Very soothing melodies with her angel voice. Welcome back, Celine!"
5,A beautiful cd ...,"When listening to this cd, I felt overwhelmed with emotions. I sat back and watched my children in amazement and with tears in my eyes. Children are little miracles themselves and we should cherish every moment we have with them. Celine did a great job singing these beautiful songs."
2,Won't soothe your little one to sleep!,"We were very excited to purchase this CD, since our 5 year old was growing tired of her Kenny Loggins and Linda Ronstadt lullaby CDs. We still use the baby monitors, so we were excited to be able to listen to something new, too. We were very surprised and not happy that this CD is basically Celine belting out lullaby songs at almost full voice, with lots of times with a very soft, soothing passage and then suddenly a very loud section. It kept startling my daughter awake. We ended up putting it in the garage sale. Very disappointing.Update: we recently found ""Sleeping with the Fishes"" and give it a rating of 5 stars for the kids!"
3,Okay,"I have always been a fan of Celine, and I grew up listenning to her. I found out about 2 months ago that sometime in mid October, Celine was going to release some sort of project cd with Anne Geddes. When I found out more, I got interested. It seemed like such a special way for her thought and love for babies to be exposed.When I bought the cd, I brought it home immediately to put it in the cd player. When I pushed play, I was somewhat pleased, but somewhat dissapointed. This cd is different from all of her others. This cd is soft with gentle melodies, and has no heart pounding or extreme energy songs. Lullaby styles make it very unique but also get somewhat repetative.I liked her Let's Talk About Love cd the best out of all her cds I've heard. I saw someone comment on how this cd is similar to it, but I disagree. There's not much I can say except, this cd is okay... definitely worth buying, but don't pack up your other Celine cds."
1,"After 5 flops in a row,where does she go from here?","Nowhere...That's the answer !Much better for her to stop recording and appearing on TV ( people are getting saturated and tired of her ) for a while and eventuallycome back sometime with less attitude.Selling tons of CDs( and now - hard to believe - even beauty products with her own label...as seen on TV and on...Amazon ..) or trying to please everybody at any cost,Selline,is not that important and has not be your major concern...That is not human,it's monstrous,terrifying.Most important it is to stay true to yourself."
1,Can't she just go and be a full-time mother?,"I was forced to hear Celine perform a song from this album on the Oprah show, and after that I knew it for sure: she succeeded in taking her 'music' to an even higher level of sappiness, blandness and false sentiment. Her music really makes me want to run to the toilet to vomit and take a hot shower after that just to rinse off the dirty aftertaste of her voice. The worst thing about it is is that this music pretends to come right out of the heart, while teaming up with that equally sappy baby photographer is clearly an attempt to earn an extra couple of millions to buy a 57th luxurious villa in Northern-Uruguay or something."
5,Miracle,I am a teacher in the infant room at a child development center. I play this during nap time and both the infants and the adults in the room relax.
3,Meh...Could live without it,"The CD is OK. It's Celine so you know the singing is stellar. But in terms of variety (different tempo and melodies, etc) all the songs tend to sound the same so there is never a ""climax"" in the arrangement.A better lullaby CD is ""A Mother's Gift"" from Carnie Wilson."
5,Beautiful,I received this as a gift when I had my first child. The music is beautiful for mothers and babies. I have since given it as a gift several times to new mothers.
2,average,"I applaud the sentiment that Celine Dion is going for here,but on a whole the songs are still just kinda there&it's been a while since She has truly had material or even a Song that reminded of where She once was during Her Run.Her voice is still good but not quite where she was."
1,Celine Dion has a baby and records an album of garbage,"Wow. This has to be one of the worst things I've heard in my life. Celine, having a baby doesn't give you the right to put out this ungodly BS. Every song on this is boring and simple.New moms might get a kick out of this but thats all, and I guess that is the point."
3,absolute perfection,"The melding of Celine's voice and the collection of songs on this CD are absolute perfection. What a terrific, appropriate, soothing gift for a new or expectant parent or grandparent. Ahhhhh....."
3,Enjoyable at some points,"I love Celine Dion and her music, this is an album for some hard core fans. Of course her beautiful voice saves the album alot, but there are still somes songs to give credit due when credit is needed due such as the song ""Beautiful boy"" and ""Miracle""This album is recommened for hard core fans,not the casual ones I personally enjoyed this album somewhat and I give it a 3.5/5 for Celine Dion."
4,Wonderful Music!,"I have enjoyed the music and Celine's beautiful voice. I would recommend this CD to anyone, especially with small children. My son (who is 15 months old) loves it and fall's asleep to it almost every night. It's delightful!"
5,Defnitely a miracle,"A beautiful voice, beautiful music, great for a baby or a mom. Makes a great gift."
4,Amazing,I have been looking for Celine singing Beautiful Boy for 2 years. What a voice and what a song. I will probably wear this out before long. The little picture book is so adorable. Thank you Amazon for introducing me to shopping from my air-conditioned home during a heat wave. Just think of the gas I'm going to save so I can spend more at Amazon.
1,dion tape,"Tape is okay as background music at baby shower, or in the nursery. I am not a celine dion fan."
5,sweet,The lyrics are heartfelt and the music is so sweet. This CD is an absolute staple for new parents. A compilation of perfect lullabies and beautiful pictures. I love it!
3,Celine....,"Not a lot of people can relate to this album. Celine as mature over her music and now that she is a mom, she concentrate on her child not because she feels the need to but because that's what it's her heart. My music teacher always told me that you will always play music that helps you escape or express your life depending on the circumstances, and right now celine his expressing her happiness. But she still stands"
2,Save your money..........or get it used.,I am a die hard Celine fan and I got this cd for my birthday...I have one word to describe it BORING. This is for little babies and their mothers. So I have it because I have it. Beautiful Boy is a good song though. If you are a die-hard Celine Fan you might want to get it used of save your money....luckily I didn't spend a cent on it.
3,Not so bad...,"I really don't agree with the other review. I think that this is a good version of a Beatles' song done by Fiona Apple. Maybe it is not quite as great as the original was, but Fiona Apple's voice does the song justice."
1,rip off,"this cd seems to be a japanese bootleg - it only has 4 songs on it and 2 of those are versions of the title track- got this as a xmas present , but wish they would have gotten her new album instead, dont waste your money"
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","She takes a great song and destroys it. It seems to progressively drag slower and slower. She's been a bad, bad girl. Don't cover the Beatles Fiona!"
5,It Takes Courage!,"Fiona did it a few years ago with this one.No one... should even attempt a Beatles song, it's just not right, But FIONA did it so incredibly that she deserves nothing but praise for this new masterpeice and her attempt was justified.Fiona's love of the Beatles is apparent in everything she writes, its in her blood, you can tell she grew up with it around her.What makes Fiona great is is her own spin...her beautuful sensual voice and pure honesty adds a new dimension to a song that could never be re-made until Fiona. Thanks Fiona for such a beautiful version.I know its been years since its out, but til this day...nothing comes close and it still stands the test of time."
5,Nothings gonna change my world.,"Across the Universe is a great Beatle song. How ever since the band was not getting along when the song was recorded/mixed. The Beatles never liked it or the entire Let It Be album. This verson of it by Fiona is awesome. Sound quality is great and she sings it like a monotone angel. John would be proud. If your a Beatle fan, or a Fiona fan or both pick this up for sure, well worth the price."
4,Fionna Apple!,Bought this for a girl years ago!Fionna Apple? Is she even still singing?Highly recommended cd if your a fan!
1,A mediocre attempt to capture the excitement of the television series,"I was a fan of the Batman comic books before the television series arose to dominate television. I was in elementary school when the show premiered and the ""Batman"" show was all my friends and I talked about, the show was a brief comet on the cultural landscape, arising to dominate the airwaves only to fall almost as fast to cancellation after only three years. Unfortunately, while this tape does a great deal to introduce the history of the Batman character on the movie screens, it utterly fails to capture the magic of the series. I found it boring, especially the very lengthy clip from an episode of ""The Green Hornet"", a weak attempt to piggyback off the success of ""Batman."" If you remember the show with fondness, unfortunately this tape will dull your edge of enjoyment."
4,Amazing flap copy!,"Gripping and intriguing. Never would have thought to pick it up were it not for the amazing flap copy. Well crafted and rich, it captured my interest right away. Kudos to the editor who wrote that!"
2,The dreaded nut loaf,"This is a new edition of a book first written in the 1960s. In England. While it is certainly of interest to those curious about the history of ""the vegan movement,"" the recipes should be avoided. I'm not sure why I bought this book, I think in those giddy first days of becoming vegan I just grabbed everything that had vegan in the title. If you see it in a library some time you may want to pick it up, just so you can see how far vegan cooking has progressed."
2,lazy cookbook,"I never found anything good in this book. I have it in the ""donation"" pile. Many of the recipes are vague--""add seasonings of your choice"" is in far too many recipes. I hate that, a few variables or range of quantity is fine but expecting the reader to intuitively choose flavorings for a recipe he/she has not tried is both ridiculous and useless. There are also a lot of lazy recipes thrown in here apparently just to take up space, for example numerous mundane variations on the ""seasoned potatoes baked in the oven"" theme.A decent alternate is ""The Single Vegan."" It has weekly schedules of recipes, but you don't have to follow them if you don't want to. The directions are clear and the recipes are easy, yet well-thought out."
1,A bad selection,"The device works properly, but the on line support is no good and the amount of books that I can download is very few."
3,Needlessly complicated,"I have to agree with those who say this book is more complicated than it needs to be. I've slogged through it to chapter 6. After decrypting some of Flew's meandering sentences and rephrasing them in plainer English, the concepts themselves weren't that difficult or mysterious. But we're all very busy, so why read and reread something unclear when you can find another book that conveys the same concepts in a clear, efficient style?"
2,I have to agree with Michael Small,"I must admit that getting into this book is like hitting a brick wall. While probably very clear for a philosophy graduate, it is, for us mere mortals, very difficult to read and hence unclear.To check this, I had a look at some of Flew's other books (""Thinking about Social Thinking"", ""Rational Animal"") and found them just as difficult.The writing style is like you would expect from an old English grammar teacher and really not typical of modern British writers (even philosophers).I found the content very disorganised and often found it hard to understand what point he is attempting to convey.I can recommend ""Clear Thinking"" by R F Holt published by Pitman. It is easy to understand, clearly classified and provides illustrations on how to analyse arguments. Unfortunately this book is no longer available new, but may be purchased second hand.Can other reviewers recommend better books on this subject that are in print?"
2,Unnecessarily wordy,"I agree with others that the writing / style is terrible. Antony's intellect could have shown through much better, and didn't require excessive wording and going arounds. Anyone can make simple things complex, smart people make complex things simple."
1,I think it stinks,"Much of the book is badly written, and it makes simple concepts seem very complicated. Flew also invents new names for widely recognized fallicies, which is sure to confuse many readers. He also seems to think that all conservatives can think clearly, uncritically citing several far-right authors."
2,Less than expected,"Being OSKA an incredible architecture studio, and having a very good Web page, I was eager waiting for the book, but unexpectedly, the layout, colors and pictures of the book weren't in the same level"
1,A Death Fast,"This is some of the worst narrative I have ever read. Sadly, to compound the issue, the narrative is not crucial to the story. It could have been easily omitted. Comics have the luxury of not needing any real narrative. That's why there are pictures. The art in this book is beautiful but could not save the overall story from ruin. It reads more like a silly crossover than a legitimate myth. If you are looking for something along these lines that is well concieved, try Hellboy by Mike Mignola or Promethea by Alan Moore. Moore's use of narrative adds to the overall story instead of detracting from it as Brin's does. For 30 bucks you'd be better off filling up your gas tank and buying a warm meal."
1,Skip it!,"Could have been a good book...should have been a good book...started out as a good book...and then, the author took a hard left turn. :(This book had tons of potential, but halfway through, the author turned it into an anti-religion screed. Yeah, outlaw the cross. Good idea.And even worse, it's a lousy screed! You can make a good story that subtly puts your message across, but that takes a lot of talent. Brin just drops into preach mode, and -most unforgivable of all!- he simply terminates the story without an end!Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on this book."
5,The album is disappointing because the songs are edited,The album is disappointing because the songs are edited. The best way to enjoy the songs is to find if you can the original versions of theses songs. That being said I feel that Alexander O'neal for years has been underrated in the r&b community. Maybe because of the substance abuse issue or may be it's diliberate. His music has affected me in ways no other artist has since The Stylistics. When a song or a group of songs can speak to you in a relative way naturally your drawn to them because they speak for you in music and lyrics things you're dying to express. The music that touches you is the music you cherish your whole life long.
3,THE BEST OF REALLY DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL ALEXANDER'S TOP HITS,AN OLDER VERSION OF THE BEST HITS PERFORMED BY ALEXANDER. THIS CD IS MISSING SOME OF THE TOP HITS I HAD HOPED TO FIND HERE. I ALWAYS LOVE ALEX'S SMOOTH VOICE AND ENJOY THIS CD BUT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW THERE ARE OTHER CD'S OF HIS OUT THERE THAT HAVE MORE HITS THAN THIS 1995 CD.
2,"Good idea, poor engineering.","This is a really cool concept, poorly executed. The clear sleeve slides up and down on an aluminum cylinder. The top of the cylinder is a rubber gasket that seals the sleeve, thus preventing leakage between the sleeve and the cylinder. All of that works fine.The problem is that at the bottom of the aluminum cylinder is a plastic ring of a larger diameter than the cylinder. This ring stops the sleeve from sliding below the top of the cylinder, and also acts as a foot so you can stand the measuring cup. Unfortunately, the ring is made from a fairly hard plastic, which can become brittle and crack. But it doesn't break away cleanly - so you're left with a measuring cup that won't stand up straight. That might be fine if you're measuring things and dumping them straight into a bowl, but if you have to sit the thing down while it's full, forget it."
2,Kirby Generation Bags,"very hard to get on the sweeper more trouble than it is worth, good price if they had worked. You get 9 3 packs"
5,So much fun!,"I was so excited to have found these, as I had them when I was a child. I am thrilled to be buying them for our daughter. I used to spend hours in my room playing with these and I can't wait to do it again with our child!"
2,not very good at all,"Pictures are often poorly chosen. While some are good, half of them could represent multiple words or they would be impossible for a child to associate with other pictures of the same word. I think better words could have been chosen for the individual letters. The little books are quite durable, though. Overall, this is not a good tool for teaching."
2,8 book cover pics DO NOT even match the letter,The pictures on the front of several letters do NOT match with the letter. I.e monkey on the J letter book; turtle on the N; baby on the Q; dolphin on the U; mouse on the V; mouse on the X; bird on the W; horse on the Y.There are only 3 pages in each book. Souldn't each book that is dedicated to a letter match the designated letter?
4,Renee Fleming sings favorite works,"Renee Fleming has turned out a fine CD of arias with which not everyone is familiar. Outstanding are Depuis le Jour from Charpentier's Louise and Marietta's Lied, Glueck, das mir verblieb, from Korngold's Die Tote Stadt. The latter is one of the most haunting arias ever written. Many of us cannot get it out of our minds. She includes Chi il bel sogno di Doretta from Puccini's La Rondine and does it well. Hers is not really a Puccini voice. Perhaps Richard Strauss and Mozart are her strengths."
5,Great CD of an exquisite singer!,"This is a great CD. ""Chi il bel sogno di Doretta"" is my favorite track. Ms. Fleming's voice is lovely. I don't understand the incessant need of some reviewers to downrate modern opera recordings. Yes, there were some magnificent singers in the past; however, there are magnificent singers today too. Ms. Fleming is one of them. It would be a shame to miss out on the lovliness of this recording as a show of loyalty to a singer of the past. This is a great CD and you won't be sorry you purchased it. It has the lyrics to the songs printed in the language in which they're sung along with an English translation where needed. This is an excellent addition to an opera or vocal music collection."
3,"beautiful voice, but at what cost?","I cannot argue with the fact that Renee Fleming was blessed with a beautiful voice. However, I cannot listen to this recording because she is so self-indulgent that the intent of the composer, the music and the words are completely lost. Her tempos are almost lethargic so that she can indulge herself in her 'beautiful voice'. When one listens to other great sopranos, Sutherland, Tebaldi, Callas, etc., the drama is delivered without all the swooping and crooning that goes on with Fleming. It is really sad that this beautiful voice cannot deliver beautiful music. What's the point?"
2,"Beautiful yes, interesting no. And I've heard better.","Yes, of course Renée Fleming has a gorgeous voice. And her performances on this album are okay, for the most part. But I don't really think she can compare to singers of the past, or even many singers of today. Basically, I see her as Leontyne Price, with a certain coldness, and with a thinner voice. ""Depuis le jour"" is lovely but I've heard it sung better about a hundred times, by Ms. Price for example. The same goes for the Rachmaninov (Anna Moffo's version makes Fleming's pale in comparison), Marietta's Lied (both Price and Kiri Te Kanawa sound much better), the Canteloube (Moffo again), Doretta's Dream (try Montserrat Caballe) and so on. I think Fleming is one of the most overrated singers of today. And not only are most of the performances surpassed by her colleagues, but there are a few that I find truly unpleasant, such as the Orff, the Strauss, the Cano, and a couple others."
3,Beautiful voice?????,"I really really don't understand why people consider Fleming's voice as beautiful????? Believe me! I have no reason to hate her. I thought she is very beautiful. Her singing of the first two songs make me so uncomfortable. After purchasing the album ""Les Bijoux"" from Sumi Jo where she sings the same two songs, the comparison is clear-cut. Jo has much more incredible vocal facility than Fleming, but she is not at all known. Buy ""Les Bijoux"" if you want to experience truly beautiful voice."
5,Wow!!!,"This album is the album that introduced me to Renee Fleming. Every selection on this recording is a gem. Her voice is so gorgeous and her technique is so solid. I love her voice so much, her interpretations of J. Strauss, Jr.'s Csardas is incredible and Puccini's Chi il bel sogno di Doretta makes me cry everytime I listen to it. She is a true American treasure. Brava Renee!!!"
1,Difficult even for an adult,"My daughter received this as a b-day gift for her 8th birthday. The basic idea is that you have all these little cardboard patterns and cut fabric from them and then use the fabric as ""clothes"" for the doll. Unless you are an experienced adult crafter w/a pair of extra-sharp scissors, your ""clothes"" will be mishapen shreds of cloth with lots of glue and strings hanging off. Fun -- not. As I write this review, I am throwing this toy away after 3 failed tries to play with it. I should add that my daughter has excellent fine motor skills - for example she makes her own beaded jewelry."
4,NICE TOOL BAG,"Heavy duty. Heavy duty zipper, but a little stiff. Works nice once you get the hang of it."
5,HIgh Quality Bag,"Very happy with this bag. Nice large size - use it to keep certain set of screwdrivers together. The zipper works a little hard due to the fact it has very large teeth, which in my opinion makes it very durable."
4,Check the dimensions!,"It's much bigger than it appears in the photo. I bought this as a pipe & tobacco pouch for the boyfriend, but it's much too big for that use. Also, leather doesn't look quite as nice in person as it does in the photo. Still, a quality product."
2,Cheap zipper,This is a piece of junk. Zipper is very stiff and takes extra heavy force to make it work. Save your $$.
1,battle of the mouse,"We periodically have mouse invasions in our house. We tried all manner of electronic traps, including these, and as others have said, they don't work or only work for a time. I think the mice get used to the sounds.We tried professional pest companies too and here is what we found. One company put down baits inside and this didnt totally control the problem. Another one had us plug up all holes we could see, put down interior and most importantly EXTERIOR bait and that did it. The bait traps have holes too small for our cats to get into but the mice love it.Find an exterminator that deploys outside as well as inside traps."
3,Pest chaser,The delivery of this item was sooner than I thought. I've been using this item for almost a month and it seems to be working. You do hear the sound if you are close to it. Consider using a lower wall outlet. If possible consider putting a unit in an attached garage. If you plug a unit into an outlet on the counter top you will hear the buzzing sound.
1,DIDN'T BOTHER THE MOUSE AT ALL!,"I saw a mouse late one night on my kitchen counter so naturally I called my mom. Apparently, another family member recommended an ultrasonic rodent repellent made by black and decker. Lowes didn't carry the brand so I went for the victor because it has more than one and I thought three smaller URR would be just as good as a larger one, plus it wouldn't look bad on my counter. Oh boy, was I wrong! I left two pieces of cereal out last night, one less than a foot away from the plugin and the other on the other side of the sink about 3 feet away. When I woke up this morning, BOTH were GONE! Besides an annoying buzzing sound, these have no use. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I will be reading reviews to see if there is one out there that works, return these noisy useless plugins, and setting a trap to get rid of this mouse once and for all!STAY CLEAR OF THESE AND GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR MOUSE HUNTING!"
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this device to scare off mice in our garage and am 100% certain it doesn't work. Why? Because I placed a sticky trap with peanut butter right in front of this thing (~4 feet away, clear view) and I've been trapping one mouse every other day for the past week I've owned it!!!"
1,horrible constant buzzing sound,I installed all three and each gives off the same audible low buzzing sound. I have no idea if they work but this is not a livable solution.
1,Waste of $$,"Bought these for a rat problem.Tried it for several days, but still hear the rat in my basement ceiling running around like it's a playground.It says in the directions not to use by any rodents type pets such as Guinea Pigs.Had to take care of a friends Guinea Pig and put one of these up against the cage and he smelled it like I was giving it food.Left it there for 10 mins and nothing. Guinea Pig didn't even move around like something was bothering him.That's a real test. Dont waste yr money on this garbage product.....it's a scam!! Would give product rating of negative stars but cannot.Sadly to say I still have the rat problem.....traditional snap traps (large ones) not working either as rats are smarter than mice."
2,I THINK THESE MICE ARE DEAF,"I have a total of 6 of these little plug-ins in my kitchen and livingroom. I think the mice actually meditate to the noise. They do not seem to deter mice at all. (But I can hear a buzz coming from each unit and they are about to drive me out of the house!!) I understand there is similar product that combines ultra-sonic and electro-pulse and will actually carry the noise through the walls. I am attempting to find such a product since I have a friend who swears by it, but purchased the product a couple of years ago."
1,mini pest boom box,The rats in my neighborhood are like squirrels in that they climb the trees and go for the bird feeders. Only difference is after dark. Well I had the great idea to take one of the mini pestchasers (which I believed worked but realize it's probably the normal poison control working)from my basement and attach it to the birdfeeder via extension cord. Looked good first night but next night when I checked there were about 5-6 of the guys having a party on the feeder literally 1/2 - 2 inches from the glowing red led not even concerned with me much less the pestchaser. I actually think it attracted more just as the music on the boom box at a beach party would people.
1,Just get a cat.,"I had these things for a while. They,at most,just annoy the mouse slightly. They work about as well as a good luck charm. The real solution to any mouse problem is...a CAT! *Gasp* NO! Not the 1700s answer, right? I'm serious, as soon as I got a cat, not a kitten, a fully grown cat, my mouse problem disappeared. Granted there were bloody mouse pieces everywhere the first week, but after that the mice quickly learned that my house was a death zone, and they stayed away."
3,It Works But Useless If Your House Is Infected,This product ONLY works if you have no mice in your home. I believe the sound keeps mice from entering your home and the ultrasonic repellent is useless if they are already there. More mice will appear even if you got rid of some since they leave a trail for others to come. You have to completely get rid of them in your house before you use the ultrasonic repellent. I tried peppermint oil with cotton balls to get rid the mice but I got lazy replacing them every month so I use the ultrasonic rodent repellent to keep them coming back and have not seen nor heard them again. My ears really hurt from the device and I believe young people can only hear the vibrant noise from the ultrasonic rodent repellent. I just tape it with a cotton ball to reduce the noise.
1,Mouse was sitting under it,Had a couple unwanted guests so we got these to keep them away. Came down to a mouse sitting under one. Waste of time
1,Does Not Work,"I purchased this product because I have a dog and I was afraid to use poison or snap traps. I was very disappointed in this product. I found mouse pellets right underneath one of these electronic mouse repellers so obiously they were not repelling the mice. I am going to try the humane mouse traps next. Buyer beware, stick with traditional mouse traps."
2,Mouse keeps coming back,"I bought these because I had a mouse that kept making his way into the house - cute little fellow that I didn't want to kill but twice a night I was catching the same mouse in the live trap then releasing in the backyard... These ""repellents"" did nothing to deter him from coming back, so I had to take him for a ride down the park... he hasn't been back since.ALso with these you do hear them, pretty annoying if you are in a quiet room or standing next to them.I'm going to leave them in my basement over the summer to see if it gets rid of any bugs."
1,Don't bother,"We just noticed a mice problem in our 700-foot apartment. We plugged these in in the bedroom, kitchen, and by the front door. We also bought the Victor Electronic Mousetrap, hoping that the Pest Chaser would chase them away, rendering the trap unnecessary. The sound is audible, but you get used to it... but I had a raging migraine for the two days we used it...And yeah, it doesn't work. The second day of use, a mouse ran right in front of it, so we have stopped using it. I am happy to report that we got a first catch in the Electronic Mousetrap, so buy that instead."
4,High quality dies,"These are high quality dies, work very well. It just takes longer to dial in compared to other die manufacturers."
3,Keepsake Books,"I purchased all of Susan Branch's books at once--sight unseen--based on the excellent reviews that her books received. All of her books were outstanding BUT I would like to share the following with others who may not realize this: Her keepsake books are basically a copy of what is already in her other books i.e. this dessert keepsake book contained only one new recipe--all of the other pages of this book appear to be copies from her other books--right down to the illustrations. Had I known this, I would not have purchased all of the keepsake books along with her ""main"" books."
3,Spanish Forms for Teachers,If you are looking for basic forms that are already in Spanish this is the book for you. If you are looking for vocabulary and phrases for oral communication with parents this is not a good choice at all.
4,Great book for vintage sports car racing enthusiasts.,"Ms. McCluggage has a wonderful writing style. Combined with her first-hand experience with the ""golden era"" of American sports car racing, this book is a great read for enthusiasts. There's good reading for the non-enthusiasts as well, as most of her writing deals with the various characters of the era. Many of my personal racing heroes are chronicled in the personal detail that only one of ""them"" could manage. This book is very entertaining even for those who regularly read her column in Autoweek, as her writing stands up to repeated readings and the book spans several years of columns. I hihgly recommend the book for those even remotely interested in the subject"
2,GENERAL ITEM DESCRIPTION NOT APPLICABLE FOR WHAT YOU ARE BUYING,"Purchased this as a gift and found that the ad description of the author's autograph is not correct for the item I purchased. Contacted the seller who promptly replied but I was in a time crunch to give the gift to the recipient.While seller clarified the situation that the book I bought was not the one as stated in the general ad ""signed by author to William Randolp Hearsts' relative"", I sure wish this was made clear before I bought the book."
3,"Worth Reading, but not Great","Ellison again brings us his paradigms on race relations in America, but this time, through an editor. John F. Callahan seems to have put this together as best he could, but I don't find the organic unity which is present in Ellison's INVISIBLE MAN. JUNETEENTH seems to be quite a few stories (and wonderful stories, at that) strung together to make a novel. They are related, but not unified. The language, however, is very compelling; the surreality of it is very powerful, reminiscent of Faulkner."
2,Brilliantly Disappointing,"Although Ralph Ellison's prose is masterfully, I found the body of work within Juneteenth to be disjointed and nonlinear in scope. Perhaps in someways it parallels Joyce's Ulysses, but falls woefully short of the mark."
2,Just say no to post death editing!,"I gave this book two hundred pages before I called it quits. Edited down from 2,000 pages to a few hundred pages, I had no clue where the book was going. The early scenes with Bliss and Hickman were the best part. The flowing from past to present was confusing at best. I'm waiting for an edition that is less edited and allows us to see where Ellison wanted to go. We can't go there now that he's gone, but even Moses at least got to glimpse the promise land. As with Alex Haley's post death career, I'm disappointed with the lackluster results; and more commited to NOT seeing an author's reputation tarnished by work that, in the end, isn't his."
4,A difficult but worthwhile read,"Juneteenth was a difficult, but worthwhile read. I have read ""Invisible Man"" and have been exposed to his prose and masterful imagery before and was somewhat prejudiced about reading ""Juneteenth"". However, I was not disappointed. The author very rarely slips out of Ellison's prose and carries the mood, the scenes and the language well. It is by no means an easy piece of literature to read. The story is serves as a background to the more prominent foci of the novel which are Ellison's highly descriptive and detailed scenes, the deep-rooted, backwoods southern language and the psychological escapades of a young boy. This book takes some determination to read as it takes much effort to grow accustomed to Ellison's style and I recommend reading ""Invisible Man"" before reading ""Juneteenth"". However, despite the work, I enjoyed the novel overall and at times was captivated by the wild scenes and intrigued by the thoughts of Bliss."
4,a good but frustrating read,"As with any other unfinished work (The Love of the Last Tycoon, The Garden of Eden, etc.) it is difficult to read this without wondering what it might have been if Ellison had finished it. On the downside, there is much here that needs explanation and fleshing out. There are interesting nods in certain directions that leave the reader longing for more. And there is the inevitable feeling that a much richer story lies just beneath the surface. However, there are rich passages of prose in this book which are a welcome addition to Ellison's body of work. The concept, the plot, and the route taken to get there is full of rewards along the way. ""Juneteenth"" is a sketch of something that could have been truly magnificent, but is still nevertheless a fascinating look into the mind of one of America's greatest writers."
3,Glimpses but Difficult,"This book gives you an interesting glimpse into what had the potential to be a truly masterful and brilliant novel. I'll give Callahan credit for making a valiant attempt at pulling together this great work. While there are passages that give you glimpses into what this work could have become, the whole just doesn't hold together well. It's very disjointed, as you would expect an unfinished work condensed from thousands of pages to be. At the end of it, I was glad to have read it, but I wasn't sure exactly what I had read or what had happened.The interesting thing is that the introductory notes, and the excerpt notes at the end gave me a better feel for what this work's potential was than the actual novel itself. It aspired to greatness, and that has to be admired, but missed the mark."
4,An Event!,"Don't listen to the naysayers. If you love Ellison, you must read this. Albeit a diamond in the rough, it's all here: vivid characters in the round, profound feeling and humanism, musical qualities underneath and at the surface... It's Ellison and it's worth it."
1,dont wast the money,"metal might be good for scrap. upset they sell such poor saw blades,blade moves about an 1/8 when spins @ high rate in chop box giving inaccurate cut lengths."
5,My 3 year old LOVES this CD,This is a terrific compliment to the movie. Both the movie and CD are great. I highly recommend them.
4,Phonics Practice Readers,The material came quickly. I was a little disappointed that the answers were filled in on the last page of the reader.
2,Not one of Small's better books.,"As a Bertrice Small fan, I enjoy everything she writes. But this one was depressing and disappointing. Even so, I liked the Rhonwyn character -- full of life and energy! And I appreciated the fact that she was an excellent warrior and very athletic!I never warmed to her boorish husband, Edward, and the way he summarily married his milksop cousin after Rhonwyn's abduction really bugged me out. Insult to the injury was added when Edward's brat kid was rubbed into Rhonwyn's face.I thought Rhonwyn's exit from the harem was a little too convenient; never have I read of a head eunuch aiding and abetting the escape of the premier harem favorite. I didn't understand why the formula was changed in this book.I gave it two stars because I'm a sucker for the harem thing."
1,A waste of words,"Small really blew it this time...she began with an interesting story and an intriguing heroine, but then sends the girl from man to man and bed to bed. I endured chapter after chapter of totally un-titillating sex in the harem, wondering all the while where the hero was and when the REAL couple would finally get together. This reader likes to see new twists on run-of-the-mill traditional romance, but this was neither interesting nor erotic, just a complete bore. A big disappointment from a big gun writer."
5,"As Usual, She Rocks!",Bertrice Small never disappoints with another amazing novel! I love these books! Everything she writes captivates readers and you can imagine yourself in that era. A Must read!
4,Small is back on track,"I was hesitant to read this book because her last two were disappointing, but I think she is on the up and up again. Her writing was descriptive and the story was wonderful! GO Ms. Small!"
3,"Yup, there's another harem","I've been here before griping about the over used plot line of the harem. To my relief it wasn't in the mediocre Besieged, but it reared it's head again in MoL. The characters were kind of blah. A day after finishing the book and I'd be hard pressed to remember their names. The hero and heroine were kind of flat. I wish there had been a little more history and background on the crusades, but oh well. The most memorable characters IMHO were the abbess aunt and the younger brother."
3,Not a genuine GTO / Mighty Mule Product,"Though this remote works fine, it is not a genuine GTO/Mighty Mule product. The description should rightly be changed to read ""GTO compatible remote control""."
2,Didn't Work:(,"I got this thinking it would actually work on my naturally dark eyebags that I have suffered from my whole life. But after using this for well over a month, nothing happened, sadly. Very sadly. I had really high hopes after reading the reviews before buying, but this product didn't help at all."
1,crap!!!!!!!!!!,Ok this product is Crap. A waste of money time and effort. I wasted time ordering it money paying for it and effort putting it on. #not happy.
2,doesn't really help,only works if you rub it on real hard and for a long period of time. but you can do that without the cream and have the same effect.
2,Burned my face,"I wanted to try this but it burned my face, I have really senistive skin and ezcema so i would not suggest buying it"
2,Disappointed,This Vit. K cream had not shown any effects on my facial spider veins. I have been using it for about a month now and no sign of improvement. However it is a good face cream (for general use) and is quick absorbing.
3,Average Anime,"This was a nice anime, but pretty average in general. There wasn't anything completely spectacular about it but it is a nice buy and a good addition to a collection!"
2,not for me,"This could have been cute, but it was too dirty for my daughter to watch, and I really like anime that we can watch together. It was too silly to be for adults only!"
3,Disappointing color,"Color is more like dark terracotta, not copper. In the picture it looks like there's a metallic sparkle to it, like a copper pot. Not so. It's really a flat finish, dark terracotta color.Love the stool, but totally disappointed in the color. That's why only 3 stars. Had I seen it in person, I would have picked another color. Just want to warn other buyers."
5,Great Step Stool,"Sturdy, attractive and convenient. I plan to buy another one for my vacation cottage."
5,Very Handy,This is a great little stool. I've got a pantry where at least half the shelves are out of reach. This little stool doesn't take up much room so it lives there full time and I kick it over to wherever I need the extra height. It's great!
5,"The classic kick-step, every household should have (at least) one","It's funny, but until you own a Kik Step, it's hard to understand why it's been such an enduring product, and why you see them everywhere. First, they are extremely well made, safe, and durable. Second, they are incredibly convenient, you literally kick them around to where you need them, and they roll on their spring-loaded, hidden wheels.Ours is now a couple of years old, and it's battle scarred, paint stained, but still going as strong as ever. It holds 500 pounds, so a full grown man toting a full-grown load can step up on it.Also, it's a great stool for working on stuff, as well. All in all, one of the more useful purchases we've ever made."
5,Best 'Kitchen' stool I have ever had.,"My wife uses a kitchen stool often.Our previous kitchen stool had four (4) rubber feet over metal legs.The rubber feet broke off -- creating a situation where the stool was slippery and scratched the floor.This stool is quite clever:1.) The stool rolls on casters -- but;2.) The casters retract when you step on the stool;3.) Rubber bumpers around parts are effective in preventing scratching of contacted surfaces;4.) Surfaces of stool -- where you step -- are absolutely non-slip.Conclusion:My wife uses this stool often and loves it.Solid, long-term tool."
4,Love the blue stool,"Love the stool. Great addition to the kitchen space for reaching top shelf items.Was expecting the color to have a metallic hue, not a flat blue. Pictures can deceive.All in all we love it!"
5,Best Stool Ever,"I work in a bookstore, and we use these stools every day. My fiance and I like them so much that we've added one to our wedding registry.Cramer stools are incredibly safe and sturdy and nearly impossible to tip over. One of my favorite features is that you can easily move them around hands-free. I often have a large pile of books in my hands, and, rather than having to set them down every time I need to move the stool, I can just slide it wherever I want with my foot.Also, stepping onto the stool pushes it down so that the rubber lip keeps it securely in place- it won't budge. And the surface is large enough that both feet fit completely without toes or heels hanging over the edge, which can be a major source of instability on ladders and stools.I can't recommend this stool highly enough. It will probably be the last stool you ever need to buy."
2,Blue color completely deceiving,"I bought this stool for looks and functionality. Sadly it completely failed in the looks department. I dont know if amazon shipped me an old model but the blue pictured, shiny and almost teal looking is not what arrived. A navy plastic looking stool is what I received. Very disappointing."
2,Giftee didn't like it.,Too big for elderly mum's kitchen. She needs a stable one step stool. I may use it in my shop. The quality is great.
5,Just what you expect!!!,"I read all the reviews about this product prior to making the purchase. Needless to say, I had VERY high hopes. I am sure that as many others, you have ordered an item and when it arrives it is very far from your expectations and from what was promised on the advertisement. Well, here you will be surprised to see that EVERYTHING they say about this product is TRUE!!! I am extremely satisfied with both the quality and the appearence of this step."
5,step stool,This has a very stable platform and is portable. I have no concerns of tipping over. I wished it rolled a little easier on thicker carpets.
5,THE USES FOR THIS STEP STOOL ARE ENDLESS!,"THE USES FOR THIS STEP STOOL ARE ENDLESS! I originally purchased it for reaching the top bookshelves in my library/bedroom. I have fallen off a three-legged stool, missed a rung on my short ladder, etc., over time, but no more injuries with this locking step stool! I use it for the storage cabinets in my laundry room, for cleaning mirrors in a high-ceilinged livingroom, inside and outside the windows, kitchen cabinets, shelves in my closet, and the list goes on, but one of the best things was putting up Christmas decorations!. One of the nicest features is being able to just nudge the stool along with my foot, and when I am ready to step on the stool, regardless of the weight I am carrying in my hands and arms, I know that I am safe from a tipping or rolling stool. THANKS, AMAZON, FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT AVAILABLE FOR HOUSEHOLD USE!!! The only problem that I have is that I don't have one in every room!"
3,Sturdy step stool,"It serves the purpose, but care must be taken when stepping on it so as not to lose footing on the lower step."
5,ROLLING STEP STOOL,"I REMEMBERED THIS STOOL FROM 30 YEARS AGO WORKING IN AN OFFICE. I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW HELPFUL IT WOULD BE IN OUR NEW HOUSE, AND ORDERED IT TO ARRIVE BEFORE THE MOVE. IT HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER AND WAS USED BY MANY PEOPLE DURING THE MOVE INCLUDING MY SHORT SELF. IT IS THE FAVORITE NEW ITEM IN THE NEW HOUSE !"
