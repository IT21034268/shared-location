2,deceptive ad,"The accompanying photo of this item, showed Three axillary cables. The unit only came with the OBDII interface. and the softwarewould not run with Windows Vista or Seven."
5,Back yard mechanic,"This autoscanner is just what you need to help one determine whyyour auto/truck isn't performing to it's maximun potential. Easy to use, gives trouble codes with definitions on screen. Does it all but you have to buy the parts and replace. Saves you money when going to service shop when you know what's needed before they say what's needed."
2,Get something else.,I've had this sink about 18 months. I don't like the stainless steel sinks so I purchased this one. It stains very easily and is very difficult to keep clean looking. I really regret my decision and I'm rethinking my position on stainless steel. Buy something else if you plan to use this sink like most folks use sinks. Mine already looks awful and I have a meticulous wife and a housekeeper.
4,"""Power Tennis""","This game is tottally the awesome. I love chosing how strong your player is,going on the tour,playing as Peach,and playing the game. Um...I really don't own this game but, I am getting it for Christmas(as far as I know). I tried it at a store. It was cool to me. Pay no attention to what I rated this. I like using Peach's special move. Hearts come up on her racket as she throws it sometimes. Every character has a special ability. I think the characters you make are the coolest (I dunno much about this game but, I may be wrong). I think it is challenging enough for me. I suggest you buy it. This is just my opinion. Buy it at your own will."
5,"A Nice, Simple, Inexpensive Bike Decoration","We bought these for my 4-year old daughter's new Diamondback Mini Della Cruz, which is aqua and salmon-pink in color. it was really difficult to find the right color of streamers for this little bike, but these seem to be it.They are pretty much what you'd expect, no more, no less. They install easily, look darling, and give a bike that extra little playful zing. I think my daughter will get a kick out of them.My only (minor) disappointment is that they are made in Taiwan, and I would have preferred any country other than China, but so goes life. For a couple bucks, I didn't expect they'd be made anywhere else."
3,Exactly what she wanted,"Bought as a gift to jazz up an old bike. Streamers are a bit fragile and break easily but it gets the job done and the joy on my sweet girls face when she sees her ""new"" bike will make them priceless."
1,do not buy,"I bought this product on sale for $40 and it is still not worth the money! I had it replaced because the bottom would not lock...and they sent me another one that would NOT lock. Also, you can not use sheets with this mat because of where the velcro for the mat to connect to the bottom is connected. So, if you get one that is locking correctly...and you don't want to use a sheet for when baby spits up/has accidents etc...then this product might be worth your money!"
1,Description is not accurate.,"I am giving this product a rating of one star because it does not, in fact, have a changer included, despite it saying that in the product name and description."
5,My Kind Of Jazz Piano,"This is another of many excellent recordings by Red Garland, a pianist known for his blocked chord technique which gave him a unique sound of which I'm so enamored that I'm still acquiring his recordings. This one was re-released about 4 years ago.Half of the sides contained in this cd were previously recorded with the Miles Davis Quintet....but these are different since two of them, ""Billy Boy"" and ""It Could Happen To You"" are played in a trio setting. The other two, ""Four"" and ""Walkin'"" include a guest appearance by guitarist Kenny Burrell.Red is known for his ability to play the blues (listen to ""Hey Now"") but his imagination and fine taste in playing the ballads have made him a favorite of mine. Three fine examples appear on this cd: ""Everybody's Somebody's Fool"", ""You Keep Coming Back Like A Song"" and ""(I'm Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over"".If you like Red Garland or great jazz piano trio, you will definitely enjoy this!"
5,This is the stuff,"This stuff sounds as fresh as the day it was released. Andy Gill has to be one of the most innovative guitarists in the history of rock music. Passionate, brilliant stuff."
1,Overrated New Wave papp,"If you've heard XTC, The Clash, Talking Heads, Wire etc. save your money and skip this band because its essentially the same except for Andy Gill's weird guitar noises which - gimmick-wise - had always been Gang Of Four's only selling point because the songwriting is, to be blunt, the pits. Obviously GoF had a big influence on the noise-rock movement of the late 80s/early 90s but that gets their accolades only so far. If you want the GoF sound done right just buy any Fugazi album and avoid this piece of Novelty Muzak."
1,Dissapointed,"Honestly, I really dissapointed because I never got my cd until today since I ordered the cd over a month ago. It supposed to be present for my husband in our anniversary but it turned out bad and made me felt bad. I ready got a charge in my credit card and paid for it but I never got it. I just wandering what happened with it. I ordered other 16 cds the same time with this cd too but I got them in mails without problem. Do I have to order it again and pay it?"
1,I'm not really familiar with them.,I'm not really familiar with Gang of Four.I really like the song I love a man in Uniform.I would like to hear more songs like that.
5,Raging anger that is sonically beautiful,"Entertainment by Gang of Four is one of my favorite albums of all time. While it would seem at first as if there was nothing subtle about the music, what with the guitars and vocals screaming in rage, the funky backbeat helps to dampen down the fury enough to allow the listener to get into a very mellow groove. The 8 bonus tracks provide added value. Essential punk funk."
5,Flawless,This is no doubt one of the best bands to come out of the post punk era. Its no wonder they are so influential anyone with even the slightest interest in alternative music should buy this today!! Use it as a reference point I dont care what era you were born in. I wont comment on any individual song becuase all of them are good.
2,Rainy Days make for a Dreary Read,"I usually can't put a Ruth Rendall novel down once I start it but it was not the case here. The beginning of the novel starts out with a strange religious ritual of some type leaving you wondering what is about to occur. It isn't until much later that you discover the purpose of it which I found very confusing. I also didn't like the side story about Inspector Wexford's daughter which seemed to be a filler since the story was so weak about the missing baby sitter and the two children she was watching who suddenly disappear without a trace. Also, the constant rain and flooding was a strange backdrop which again seemed like words to fill up the pages without a real purpose to the story.As always, her characters are always very unusual with some type of dark background. This was the only strong part to me. The babysitter and her cougarish ways was the most interesting part of the story. Overall, I recommend staying away from the book. YOu will be disappointed."
3,Another good Wexford mystery,Ruth Rendell gives us another solid mystery for Wexford to solve. The flooding in Kingsmarkham adds a nice background to the story line. Rendell is terrific at showing the secrets that drive characters to behave as they do. With two missing children and their babysitter Wexford is off on another twisted tale that will keep you guessing until the end.
3,can do better,like her writing and her description of characters is funny without being offensive BUT all the missing people turn up themselves???????????? so how did wexford solve the mystery?????? they just come back without him doing much. not impressed with that
4,"It's not the forest, stupid: it's the trees","This ranks as one of the best of the recent Wexford novels, witty and sneakily engrossing. Don't crack the cover unless you have plenty of time and no appointments to keep: you might otherwise be late, or fail to turn up at all. It isn't the plot, as much as the telling. At the center is a snottily dysfunctional family, the children of whom (along with their 30-something baby-sitter) disappear one rain-drenched weekend in Kingsmarkham. Along the way, Rendell provides some mordantly hilarious characters, sardonic comments on the state of the world, and a few blatantly red herrings. It's a good trek through the forest, whether one sees the resolution well before it's reached or not: sly, entertaining and well-paced. Rendell is the best writer of psychological mysteries on the planet. ""Wasting one's time"" and her name -- are simply not compatible phrases."
3,Most disappointing in series,"I am a big British mystery fan, and have read all of Ruth Rendell's Wexford series. I anticipated a well-written, pleasant read with this book, and was disappointed. At times, I wondered if she had even written this book! It seemed simplistic, it dragged, Wexford and Burden were wooden; in short, it lacked the polish and spark that have always characterized this series for me. Rendell moves down in my list of favorite British mystery authors, below Colin Dexter and Elizabeth George."
5,You just gotta love Wexford,"I am a bit of a boring person when it comes to the style and topic of books I like to read. I thought I might go out on a limb and read something a little different. Well I sure am glad I did.This book is great. The characters believable, the plot totally supported with no messy bits that don't make sense, lots of appropriate subplots, and suspense and teeth-grinding build up.I won't describe the plot, you can read that in other people's wonderful reviews, but I will say if you like your mystery and suspense, then Ruth Rendell rocks.Not only that but her use of description is so right on, I pictured her characters with no problem-not always an easy thing for a forgetful Wiccan monkey :)5 stars *****"
3,Terrible reader on this audiobook,I am a big Rendell fan and & also a fan of unabridged audiobooks. This reader does a terrible job. A lackluster reading that does not do justice to Rendell's prose. When one compares this reader with such as Davina Porter & the like - there is no comparison. VERY DISAPPOINTING.
4,The Babes in the Wood,"Ruth Rendell is a prolific writer of mysteries, and has now written 19 in the Chief Inspector Wexford series. This one has two plots interwoven. One involves Wexford and his family, and one of his daughters who is in a relationship with someone he doesn't like. The other is the disappearance of two local teenagers and their adult ""babysitter."" This takes place at a time when there is heavy rain and flooding for Wexford to contend with on both a personal and professional basis. This is a must read for Rendell and Wexford fans."
4,Bang the Drum Brilliantly (Spoiler Attached),"You've got to hand it to Ruth Rendell. While so many other mystery writers (P.D. James, Sue Grafton amongst others) have completely run out of steam, she's like the Energizer Bunny: she keeps going and going and going. And to push the battery metaphor to a ridiculous extreme, her books remain electrifying! (My apologies to Ms. Rendell, who would never stoop to such banal, cliche-ridden prose.) With ""The Babes in the Wood,"" Rendell is in prime form, presenting a truly twist-filled, surprising novel that will keep you guessing until the very end. I must say, however, that it would have made more sense to me had the killing been revealed to be accidental; I found premeditated murder a little hard to swallow. But that's quibbling. If you're a Rendell/Wexford fan, you're likely to find ""The Babes in the Wood"" tremendously rewarding. And if you're not yet a fan, I bet you'll find it so as well."
3,Has been out for years,I wish Amazon would stop offering me books that have been out for years and hawking them as if they were new.
3,Streabbog was stuck in a rut.,"Out of all the musical forms he could have chosen, Streabbog wrote all of the pieces in this book are in the ternary form. All of the melodies are in four-measure blocks, and there is almost no counterpoint. Variety of harmony is also lacking. Pungent dissonances such as diminished sevenths and augmented sixths are non-existent.Burgmuller and Clementi win by a wide margin."
1,Not What I Expected,"This was a present for my boyfriend who collects NIN music. When I got it, it was in a flimsy, aftermarket looking case and the artwork did not appear to be original. I doubt this is the way this single was originally sold. If I hadn't had to wait so long to get this to my boyfriend, I would have tried to send it back."
2,Who wants to get funky?,"Hey, you like Gary Numan? You know that dude who wrote that song ""Cars"" back in the early eighties in addition to many other classic synth-pop songs? Well, get one of his records(may I recomend ""The Pleasure Principle"" or ""Replicas"") over this pale imitator. Come on Reznor, you can do better than this."
2,i agree 100%-this is not a calamity jane soundtrack!!!,"I was thoroughly disappointed to finally discover a cd w/tracks from the foot-stomping, whip-smacking, grand old musical, Calamity Jane, starring the one and only Doris Day. I have searched everywhere and have only found 3 cds-calamity fans.This one w/pajama game, another w/i'll see u in my dreams and the play version-which i must add, only has such unforgetable tracks as ""I've Got a Hive Full of Honey"", and ""Harry I'm Planning to Marry"" and so on. Sadly, it is not the movie cast we have loved over time, so if anyone finds the same kind of soundtrack in the movie version-please inform me!!!"
3,Missing Songs,"For some reason, three well known songs are left out of this release of ""Pajama Game"" -- all excelent numbers. They are ""Hey, There"", ""Steam Heat"", and ""7 1/2 Cents"". Why??? Too bad!!"
3,This is NOT the Calamity Jane Soundtrack!,"This is a good CD, but if you are looking for the original soundtrack recordings from Calamity Jane, you will be disappointed. It should be entitled, ""Doris Day Sings Songs from Calamity Jane."""
3,Original Recordings,"Columbia issued a 33 1/3 rpm in 1953, called ""Doris Day & Howard Keel in Calamity Jane"" which contains 8 tracks. The cover claims that these tracks are from the original movie soundtrack of the Warner Brothers production. Howard Keel was under contract with MGM, and the cover notes that his participation in the album is ""courtesy of MGM"".My sister has the original album. If you check under the Doris Day CDs there's one with the original album cover for Calamity Jane combined with ""I'll See You in My Dreams""."
2,Tin Sound Ruins Great Soundtrack,"I bought this recording as I loved the film version of the Pajama Game. However, the sound is often too 'tinny' or too brassy sounding. Also, for some reason, the order of the songs on the cd is out of sync with the order in the film. The ""Finale"" was put before ""Hey There"" , ""Steam Heat"", and ""71/2 Cents""..so for those of you who think the songs were omitted, double-check your cd!! Of course, it's possible they were dropped by mistake by the company..I bought mine a few years ago. I wonder if the newly remasterd version, released last year, sounds any better?"
2,Pajama Game Soundtrack,"The CD of Pajama Game's soundtrack is missing one of it's major songs -""HEY THERE"". The song is one of the score's major assets - a lovely hit ballad sung by John Raitt. The CD would rate a Five Star if this wonderful song had not been omitted."
2,I found it useless,"A typical ""you have to set the rules"" piece of software. First of all, SpamKiller sits between your e-mail program and your server. When you D/L your e-mail, SpamKiller gets it first. YOU then have to decide what to let through and what not to let through. Quite honestly, I could do that just by letting my e-mail program D/L the mail and then look through it. By the time you set up enough ""rules"" so that SpamKiller automatically junks that e-mail, you have started to eliminate mail you want. I say ""no go"" on this one."
2,No time to figure it out!!!,"Installed the software and it completely reconfigured my Outlook Express, while not helping immediately with the spam. Filters were for individual messages so each new message would have it's own filter - why bother? Probably a good program but I don't have the time to put into it. A program like this should run seamlessly! It also installed Mcaffe security center which constantly pestered me and couldn't be turned off or uninstalled without uninstalling Spamkiller!! I have uninstalled everything and will put up with the spam until they get it right."
3,Kicks Most Spam Out of Your Inbox,"This program is very effective at detecting and segregating SPAM email. However, that is where its usefullness ends. The other things to ""fight SPAM"" like sending error messages that your email address doesn't exist and sending complaint letters to website administrators do nothing to stop or even decrease the amount of SPAM you receive. Most of the complaint letters and error messages you send come back as ""undeliverable."" I bought version 4.0, and since version 4.5 is now available, my version does not work at all. I am required to purchase the new version because I already used up my 30 day free trial period."
4,Pretty good,"Spamkiller 4 does a pretty good job of catching spam. It's easy to rescue a message if it's accidentally put in the Killed folder, and it's easy to create a new filter if a spam isn't caught so you don't get it again. There's a handy icon in the system tray that shows when there's new email. This is a stand-alone program. If you are thinking about getting SpamKiller 5 or Norton AntiSpam (which integrate with your email program) be sure to read the reviews first!"
1,Spamkiller,"Spamkiller has been very unstable. I've reinstalled it over 20 times, because it stops loading after a while. Also, it no longer is importing my Outlook addresses. The tech support chat is not much help."
1,Bracket,"This is the product that Walker lists as a OE replacement for a P30 chassis. Unfortunately it doesn't even look like the original. It's turned 90 degrees and considerably lighter duty then factory. Probably a good car part, but not what the truck chassis used."
5,An essential tool,This volume is an essential tool for anyone who wants to seriously make the scriptures come alive. It has been said that Israel as a nation is itself a fifth gospel. The more people read the bible with maps and photographic images to hand to bring the stories and places alive the more comprehensible it becomes. The events happened in real time to real people just like us. We can get a sense of the power of the Empires that so impacted Israel to teach them that the God of Israel is a holy God who is very involved with the day to day events in peoples lives.
5,!!,The atlas givesa good comparison of texts for visualizations of the lands in earlier times and today.
5,A top-tier selection,"This is an excellent reference volume, very readable and has multiplied charts, maps, and pictures, without being so massive as to discourage its use."
4,Holman Bible Atlas,"I bought this book for a class I am taking, but I am finding it helpful in other ways. It is very useful."
2,poor map quality in kindle version,"the atlas itself seems to have large amount of information, but the map quality in kindle version is poor.Although you can zoom in the map, but you can not read small letters in the map because of the low resolution of the figure.it may not possible to make with high resolution because of the size issue of the file, but at least Amazon has to mention the resolution in the description of kindle version."
1,Wrong Item,"What I got was a one drawer instead of a two drawer chest. I tried to report it to Amazon, but they only referred me to the maker/seller who never called me back!!!!!!!!!!1"
5,A Great Flatware Chest,"I just received the Reed & Bartibn Grande Flatware chest. The quality is superb and the chest is very large. It comfortably holds all my serving pieces as well as the usual pieces. The slots for the butter/fish knives is also an added benefit.However, the price listed on Amazon is too high. Purchased my chest for $156.00 with no shipping (no tax added; you must pay that yourself as is the case with all Internet purchases that do not collect tax). The only drawback with such a large chest is that once filled, it is very heavy. The chest alone has heft. The handles are not particularly comfortable for lifting. If the handles were fully rounded, that would be better. I guess this chest, once filled, is best left in place and not carried about. This is important if you intend to store the chest in a place where you must ""get it down"" when you intend to use the flatware. Can't store this in the cupboard above the fridge!This is a great buy and will last for many years."
4,Good value,"Very nice flatware chest for the price. I have 14 place settings of my fancy flatware, plus two hostess sets, and it all fits with plenty of room to spare. The drawer pulls are a little awkward - I expected them to swing like little D-rings, but they are stationary. I would actually replace them myself with something else if the felt lining wasn't glued in to cover the screws.All in all - nice product, good quality. Would purchase again."
3,LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING...,"Truely this is one sharp looking travel bar. Unfortunaly looks alone can not carry this item into first place. If you get a classic ""Trav L Bar"" I believe you will be happier. First of all the ""Picnic Time Manhattan Case"" carries only two bottles. While the tradional ""Trav-L-Bar"" allows three. Both come with glasses and accessories, one might think if you have the 2 bottle Picnic Time Bar, that it would be smaller and lighter. But it isn't, it's bigger and heavier, than the 3-bottle competion. And that is the problem with this unit, it's just to big and bulky to carry around. And that is why I can not give it my stamp of approval, sorry. Ace"
5,Great Present!,I bought this item as a holiday gift for a friend of mine. It arrived in a timely manner and was exactly like the picture. My friend loved it!
3,"Bulky and certainly not sleek, but will get the job done",We bought this item online. When it arrived I was quite disappointed. It is bulky and certainly not sleek. It does not have sleek edges which makes it look rather unwieldy. It does get the job done though. You are able to carry two 750ml Bottles.
4,Not as shown in the picture,"i must adimit that i bought this particuliar one because in the picture it did not have the wrap to hold the glasses. my plan was to substiture other glasses for the ones shown.when it arrived the glasses had the wrap to hold them in place. i was not pleased with this. i would have bought the tan one, it just looked nicer."
3,Picture doesn't match product,"I ordered 6 of these as gifts. I selected black because in the online picture both the interior and exterior were black. The burgandy one was tan on the inside and I preferred the darker interior color. However, when they arrived, and I checked them out, they were all tan on the inside. While I was disappointed, I did decide to keep them. One had to be returned, but it was quickly replaced."
3,Disappointed,"My order was backordered for 2-1/2 months and is disappointing after finally arriving. One of the glasses is broken. The case is very large and only has room for 2 bottles. There is a lot of wasted space. For the price, I expected more and will return it."
5,THIS SONG DESCRIBES ALL PASSENGERS <MALE & FEMALE>,"""No Scrubs"" is the best song TLC could have come out with. It describes all the passengers that be trying to holla and ain't got no ride of their own!!! I can't lie, I was once a scrub, but I have made a come up now!!"
4,I can relate to this song!,Great hit! I was wondering when they were going to come out with something new.
4,TLC's best!!!,I adored the single but the only disappointment is that there isn't Left-Eye rapping in the album. The video has her rapping and I want that single.
3,I am a Scrubb and I don't think this song is very funny.,Scrubbs are cool. TLC is a bunch of dumb girls
1,Grammar check PLEASE,"These airheads need a lesson in grammar-""I don't want no scrubs"" is a double negative which REALLY means that they want scrubs. They are three stupid bimbos."
1,Ick Ick Ick!,"I am really sorry. But this song is really just a bunch of balony. ""I don't want no scrub""? You can't even understand them. Those artificial babes really need a kick in the head. The Spice Girls are better than TLC! Ick everyone! Get in the now! Reality Check!"
1,Too Bad There Arent Negative Stars,I hated this cd! it sounds like trash! Only trailer park trash listens to this garbage!!!!!!
4,"I don' want no Scrubs at my door,","Scubs what can you say, T.L.C rocked the house this time so Boys who are Scubs take a hike because we as Ladies don't want no mamma boy scrub. TLC this song was hit but I have to be honest Whitney Housten song Hearbreak Hotel is better."
5,no scrubs kick butt,i used to listen to waterfalls but it got boring but know TLC is back and better than ever and i love them
5,IT WAS GREAT,NO I DONT WANT NO SCRUB A SCRUB IS A GUY WHO THINKS HES FINE AND ALSO KNOWN AS A BUSTAAMY
4,movie,"It was a very unusual movie. I was a bit confused about their relationship, but I was entertained enough to watch the whole thing."
2,Boring to watch,The actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking. The story is too unbelievable too. It was a waste of my money to buy it.
3,"Worth seeing, but distractingly flawed","The only thing that separates this film from high-budget Hollywood stuff is the poor production quality. Some of the actors are second-rate (including the male lead) and the fact-checking, research, and continuity could have been a lot better. In the non-sex scenes, the writing was naive (or just ignorant) and the acting unconvincing. The theme and the development of that theme are pretty ordinary and eminently marketable.However, it's a titillating, sexy movie. Someone else described it as soft porn.... I think that's a fair description."
2,Porn? Sex? Entertainment? Where??,"This was so boring my fiancee fell asleep and I envied him. The acting wasn't even 2nd rate, the texture, feel and color of the entire movie was incredibly bland, & I couldn't at all buy any realisim in this flick at all.Save your time, skip over to the next video tape you see. Barney the purple dinosaur has more punch than this movie."
1,Wast time & money,This movie is about a doc.com man has too much easy money to give away. Not much erotic stuff at all.
1,The Center of the World,This is a movic about a dod.com guy who has too much money to wast. Not erotic at all.
2,stop!,"OKAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE STOP THE STUPID SHAKY CAMSTUFF! It is so tired. It is too distracting. I mean I wanna watch a movie not watch some bad shooting and pseudo artistry. Also there was bad ghosting or blurriness in the basketball scene that was highly annoying. The story was okay. I got tired of seeing his rear. I didn't find myself really caring about either character, except the hooker. Sexy? A little bit. Pass!"
2,Slow and Steady Lost the Race,"I found this movie to be pretty flat. I was expecting it to be a little more entertaining after reading other reviews. The characters were well done by the actors, but predictable. Also, the one scene that earned it an unrated listing (lollipop) could have been deleted without removing from the overall message of the movie. It is almost like Wang just wanted to see if he could make the first porn movie with a plot and had to sneak something in the movie that would push it past a standard R rating. I have seen worse films, but my time is too precious to have wasted it on this 88 minute snooze fest. It was too slow and depressing for me. But maybe that is what the lives of a ""computer geek"" and a ""lonely stripper"" are all about: a few minutes of excitement interspersed with hours of boredom and self-loathing."
2,Potential not fully developed,"Center of the world certainly has a good premise. However the movie seems to favor explicit ""eroticsm"" over character development. when the film ended I kinda wished it was longer. I guess that's a good thing. But the reason why is that I didn't get to know these people. WHy is the guy such a social [misfit]? He being a computer whizz doesn't fully explain it. I thought some of the cutesy moments like her being a southern belle talking dirty in the bar, was a little forced. But over all I felt the film mainly wanted to titilate, with some sheens of artistry here and there. IT was a good movie more of a 2 and a half than a 2, but it didn't quite go the distance for me."
1,Not what I thought,"I was thinking there would be more passion or at least more sex. Too much time was wasted in this movie on scenes that were of no interest. Such as the actors sitting around ALOT, or walking and talking about nothing. Not much happens in this movie. The ators were not beautiful... in fact they were ugly."
1,Too much Greek,"Was too difficult to figure out the pronunciation of the Greek letters. No help at all. Thankfully, every one in Greece that we encountered spoke just enough English."
3,Lost In Space,This item never arrived; it was lost somewhere in shipment. The seller generously gave me a refund and I've since ordered a new copy from Amazon.
4,A Good recording.,"The original is my perferred version, even though it is very watered down. Here, all the songs are complete, but it comes out uneven somehow. The really great performers here are Carol Burnett and Barbra Cook. They really shine. The rest do mediocre performances. Out of the rest, Lee Remick, and Elaine Strich do a great job. Buy this you want the ""complete"" version and four stellar performances, but the original is the one to get performance wise."
4,Cook and Co. make this one of the best!,"Of all the FOLLIES recordings out there:The ORIGINAL is a must, if only for it being first (although it is horribly truncated).The PAPER MILL recording is the most complete and features Michael Gruber's beautiful version of the cut song ""Who Could Be Blue"".But this recording is a must for Barbara Cook's DEFINITIVE ""Sally""! Her renditions of ""In Buddy's Eyes"" and ""Losing My Mind"" are THE best versions without question. Lee Remick is also quite good, the men to a lesser degree depending on your tastes for George Hearn and Mandy Patinkin (though each have fine moments here). The supporting cast is a delight with Elaine Stritch's ""Broadway Baby"" a triumph. Carol Burnett does a fine job with ""I'm Still Here"" though I much prefer the versions of both Yvonne DeCarlo and Ann Miller.Overall, this a great lineup of talent so get the CD and the video too!"
4,Very good read,"I like the way that it defines words using their root rather than common associated meaning! Dover AFB, Mil Lodge #28"
2,Mediocre Offering,"This book is useful, but not at all as informative as I hoped it would be. Very basic."
5,Appreciative Inquiry process,This is an excellent book describing the theory and research about the foundation of Appreciative Inquiry and also a practical guide to facilitating groups in using it. It provides an outline and details on each meeting with steps and stories to illustrate the concepts. I have used it in working with non profit groups and people become very excited about the process.
1,Where is my book ?,"I ordered this book on Jan 11, 2011. It is Feb 14, 2011 and I still have NOT received this item. Will I ever order again from this sight ? Probably not."
5,I Laughed till I Cried!!! Incredibly Clever and Witty,This is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to prove the existence of God to non-believers. It uses the very same logic that athiests use to say that there is no God to show that there is no real proof that that person even exists. It is soooo funny!! Even the non-believer will be laughing!
2,not so great,There's a weird plastic clip on the back that's not shown in the photos. Even when you remove the clip there's still a plastic piece embedded in the back of the case.
5,The Best!,"This is the best garlic powder ever! After trying it in several recipes, I bought some for all of my daughters who also love to cook, and they agreed. This garlic powder doesn't have that strong, bitter taste (and aftertaste), that many do. It is a good substitute when you have no fresh garlic for making garlic bread. It doesn't lose its' flavor in a strong soup or sauce."
3,Afro - American or what?,"Right, so it's not Afro-American, but American-Afro. Or? Cool thing mixing american musicians with musicians from Kenya. It works fine as long as we keep it on the kenyan game plan with an american touch, but when it comes to these american songs, it doesn't really carry all the way. They fall heavily and uninspired as rather unprofessional platitudes. Fusion music of any kind, should take the best ingredients from different genres or cultures or what ever and make something special of this. It happens all the time and makes the music world more exciting, but this record manage it only half of the time. On the other hand, it manages it well at those occasions. Try to keep still when You here the title song Ok-Oyot System! I'll bet You can't. So I'll give this record three stars of five. If I could cut out two maybe three songs, I would give it at least four stars."
4,Corporate Tax for Dummies,"This volume reduces into terms capable of being readily absorbed the application of Subchapter C. The examples and explanations are basic while conveying the needed concepts of various treatments of contributed property, boot, distributions, attribution rules, etc."
5,Great For Beginning Developers!,"Greg's book is one of the best ASP.NET beginning development books that I have ever read. I have purchased a total of 68 books on ASP.NET, ADO.NET, C#, and VB.NET; this is 1 of 5 that I still keep at my desk at work for reference. This book contains web applications and topics including the following:ForumsEditable DatagridsProduct CatalogWeb ServicesMobile ApplicationsSessions VariablesSending EmailShopping CartDatabase ConnectivityLoginsCookiesAND SO MUCH MORE!Pick this book up today; it is a wise investment, especially for a beginner who desires to own a book that covers VB.NET, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET together."
3,"Pleasing overall story, plot awfully forced and fake","Overall, the story is pleasing. However, the plot is so desperately contrived in order to make the story work. Without revealing the story, there is a past history between the two main characters that is so implausible for various reasons--gullibility, legality, human nature, etc. But this ridiculous backstory exists in order to set the stage for the story being told.The ending is terribly forced as well. Much too ""and they all lived happily ever after"" considering the grievous ills committed by subcharacters.That said, if you can ignore all the contrived ridiculousness, the main characters are interesting and the story is a light, entertaining read."
1,Trash,LaserLine should go back to there original 90 cd holder which was squared in and out. This current rack makes it a hassle to put cd's in. If you don't angle it just right you can crack your cd case with almost no pressure. With this problem if you have 2 or more racks and you need to move the cd's around your screwed. In short.... you would be better off using a cardboard box.
4,overall a good product,"I bought these dumbbell bars about a year ago. They work just fine for my purposes - I have a simple ""home gym"" with these dumbbells, an exercise mat, and a chin-up bar. The screws that hold the weights on the end do come loose a bit because it's metal-on-metal with no rubber, so the weights rattle and spin a little, but the threaded ends of the bar are long enough that the screw won't fall off unless you are stacking more than 3 plates on each side (if you use 10-lb plates, that's like 60 lbs per dumbbell. If you're lifting that much, you should probably invest in nicer equipment anyway)."
4,Great for the price!,"As any dumbbell bar goes, the ends tend to spin off on these. I added some electrical tape to the threads near the grip and that stops most of it as well as a lot of the classic metal weights sound. Grips are nice and the chrome doesn't seem to be flaking off yet. Added 20 more pounds to each and so far so good. Very good purchase, especially at this price."
3,requires attention,I use steel plates and the bolts keep loosening during workouts. I'm going to get some rubber spacers to see if I can make it stop.
3,Acceptable,"I have used these handles for several years. Generally I am content with them. Sometimes I wish they were longer to hold more weight, but that is a trade-off. The handle area is rather thin compared to ""pro style"" dumbbells at most gyms.I have taken to using a pipe wrench on the collars, and they have held up quite well to this, so the metal appears to be good quality. It would be nice if the pipe wrench was unnecessary, but I would probably do the same with any basic ""spin lock"" handles that do you have an auxiliary locking mechanism.Unrelated to the pipe wrench, the finish flakes off easily. The flakes are messy, and can bite into skin a times. I would prefer bare metal."
5,Exactly what I wanted,I have been lifting weights for a few weeks and the Dumbells I had used a Clamp of sorts that was not very solid. This is great cause I dont have to worry about the weights sliding off. Till I can save up for Adjustable Dumbells ;)
2,"Not a bad product, but not great either.","The main objection I have with these is that the spining ""locks"" don't lock. As I use the weights they tend to come lose. It's not terrible, becausethey have to spin around about 5 or 10 times before they fall off, but it's unsettling to have to check the weights after each use, so I ended up using spring locks in addition to the spin locks, which seems like overkill, but it works. Also, some of the spring locks are a tight fit around the threaded bar. Worth buying if you really need to save some cash, but I recommend spending a bit more and getting the traditional."
5,Failure of amazon to transmit my message.,"Excellent product. There was a miscommunication about number of units. the company,fitness products,Was extremely helpful and understanding since the problem was not their fault. I accidentally ordered it twice by accident, I immediately called amazon and was assured the problem would be fixed but they did not communicate this to the fitness company.And I received it twice."
1,Yup!,"When I bought this product, it was suppose to be BRAND NEW. I got a USED product, sealed in a crappy package that was pre-opened before me. I'm sorry, did I NOT pay for a brand new product? To further assist my statement, one of dumbbell closers was messed up so it wouldn't go all the way in. When I looked inside of it, it was a messed up, scratched, and in a really bad shape. THIS IS A NEW PRODUCT?You deserve one star. The worst thing I've bought on Amazon, and it surely not Amazon ... whomever I bought this from know who they are. I'll never do business with them ... ever."
3,Should have read the playlist more closely.,"I purchased this album for one of my children. He has shown an interest in Perry Como and I wanted to have some music for him to listen to.This album has most of Como's ballads. I was hoping for a few more upbeat songs. I skimmed the playlist, but I should have read it more thoroughly. ""Hot-diggity-dog"" is a fave, but the rest of the album drags."
5,Perry still has it.,The songs still sounded very good. Most of them I was familiar with. Some I still remember. Worth the cost.
1,Perry Como was a sub par singer!,"I was disappointed with this album. Being a huge Martin / Sinatra fan, I was told I would enjoy Como by a friend. Unfortunately, the man could not sing. His voice cracks and cracks, no flow, nothing. PS The arrangements to most songs are even worse. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR DEAN AND FRANK!"
4,The legacy of late Louis Armstrong,"Let's face it, at the time of these recordings Satchmo's glorious trumpet was all but silent and, although his voice was still highly expressive and emotional, it has lost some of its rhythmical versatility.The music is still more than pleasant, with the ammount of jazz diminishing with the diminishing of Satchmo's unique performing power. It simply seems unreasonable and biased to give five stars to this cd when you compare it with, for instance, Satchmo's work in the 50's (""Satch plays Fats""!) or with the Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings of his golden early days."
3,Pop Pops,"Armstrong introduces this version of What A Wonderful World with a monologue about how people don't believe it's really a wonderful world in which we're living after all... The CD closes with nothing less than Give Peace A Chance, the Lennon Bed-In anthem. Armstrong sounds like he's enjoying himself, in spite of the sumptuous overproduction swirling around him. He's relieved of trumpet-playing duties by a handful of session musicians. Ultimately a record of Armstrong's vocal stylings, some weird song selections and plenty of good humor (see the cover photo for details). WARNING: This is not the album ""What A Wonderful World"" with Cabaret, Hellzapoppin', etc. The track listing for this BMG release is: What A Wonderful World, Everybody's Talkin', Boy from New Orleans, We Shall Overcome, The Creator Has A Master Plan, Mood Indigo, This Black Cat Has 9 Lives, My One and Only Love, His Father Wore Long Hair, and Give Peace A Chance."
4,what a wonderful world,Louis Armstrong reminds us through his voice what a simple and wonderful world we once had. This record is a classic - will never fade. Even my 6 year old son liked it.
1,The voters are insane,"My mom is alway listening this dumb album. Personaly I think it's terrible, but of course I have to listen to it. Every time I hear it I have to plug my ears to avoid listining his uttterly obnokious voice, especially if its the song What A Wonderful World. WHAT? DON'T WE HAVE THE FREEDOM OF SPEACH ! ."
3,30 minutes of Armstrong's most commercial music,"While this record is indeed Louis Armstrong, and therefore better than 98% of the music available out there, it is only of marginal interest when considered within the specific context of Louis Armstrong's incredible and revoluitionary career. The disc is only 31 minutes long, which in the age of CDs is unforgivable. This is a great record for those with a superficial interest in Satchmo, especially those who want to have ""It's a Wonderful World"" in their collection, but not for anyone interested in exploring Armstrong's unmatched capabilities as a true jazz virtuoso. Most of the tunes here are overproduced and highly orchestrated. Still, it is Louis Armstrong..."
3,Good Pre-Transformers Toy,"I bought this toy for my son's third birthday, and he has had fun with it. There aren't many things that need to be moved to change the jet into a robot, so it's easy for a little guy to do, and with a couple of different sound effects, it keeps his interest. This toy is good for the child who is too young for transformers, but moving in that direction. It's a little pricey for what it's worth, and a few more options or features would make it a lot better."
1,REALLY REALLY AWFUL NEVER AGAIN,NO AIRPORT CARD LOOKED LIKE IT WAS REBUILT SCRATHES EVERYWHERE NO USB NO ETHERNET INPUT IT WAS JUST AWFUL SPECS WERE WRONG LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING
3,You never know what you're going to get with the Lilys...,"First it was My Bloody Valentine (In The Presence Of Nothing). Then it was the typical indie sound (A Brief History Of Amazing Letdowns). Then on Eccsame The Photon Band we find out what album was on Kurt Heasley's turntable when he was writing the songs for this CD. It had to have been Pink Floyd's ""Meddle"". Seems like Kurt goes through phases in music -- and records his version. It's all good because Lilys always make it work. All I can say about these songs is if you liked Pink Floyd's ""Meddle"" (or just like slowed-down, trippy , experimental music) you'll go for this one. If only Kurt would start listening to the Beatles and the Byrds. No, wait, he must have already started...I just got Better Can't Make Your Life Better. Ahh, what's next?"
1,Not ready for prime time...,"Headphones delivered by seller quickly and in factory-sealed packaging, but left channel inaudible at maximum comfortableright channel voume setting. Sound quality on right channelconsiderably poorer than inexpensive standard earbuds. Both packaging and insert lack any manufacturer's warranty from Turtle Beach, and company's website states:""If you purchased a product from another retail or onlinevendor, while we're happy to try and resolve issues, any returns do have to be coordinated through the point of purchase."""
3,Amsterdam info,You should buy this dvd because it tells the story of good ole Amsterdam.A little shakey at times but I would be shaking too..Buy it and you will LMAO.
3,Mixed response to quality of audio,"this unit worked exactly as billed, but I had serious problems finding the right channel to set to, in order to avoid bleed-over from neighboring FM broadcast stations. What I attempted to do, was use an mono-stereo plug adapter to plug this adapter into a mono-speaker jack on the back of my ham radio, so that the audio from the mobile ham radio would be broadcast onto my car's stereo speakers instead of listening to the built in radio speaker down on the radio under my seat. Audio quality was not acceptable to me for this purpose, possibly affected by using the mono-stereo adapter plug. I've installed an extension speaker up by the dash, wired back to the mobile radio, and it works much better.My 15 yr old son uses this now for what it was intended, i.e. playing his MP3 player thru his mom's car stereo speakers and he seems to be happy with it.At the low price I paid, it was worth the experiment."
2,Garbage quality,"This product arrived at a decent time, had no defects and worked like it says.The quality of the transmission is terrible.You can't turn your MP3 players volume up past 3/4 of the way or it will distort the music.The audio that transmits to the Radio is muffled and doesn't sound good at all [even after adjusting the EQ]I wouldn't recommend this to anybody."
3,fm transmitter,Sound is not as clear as I thought it would be. There is distortion and you have to position the wire at a certain angle to get a decent sound.
5,Great iTrip for Mp3 players,"Griffin iTrip is a great product for anyone looking to use their Mp3 in the car. It lets you choose from multiple radio stations, allowing room to adjust given static or interference when traveling. It is very lightweight and the cable is long, giving you freedom to move the Mp3 in different places. The car charger also has a USB slot so that you can charge your Ipod or any other USB cable device. Overall it is a great product at a really good price."
4,Works good with music,"I purchased this product so that I could listen to audio books that I have downloaded from the library onto my MP3 player. Every time I tried to listen to a book, the device would go into sleep mode after 5o seconds. I thought something was wrong with the transmitter so I tried listening to music and it works great (thanks to the reviewer who told us to change to the universal mode- that was a life saver.) Can't figure out what to do to get the unit to recognize the book- any advice would be much appreciated."
2,You get what you pay for...,"While this device is cheap and can be used on any mp3 player, it does a poor job of broadcasting the signal. I was convinced by the positive review describing how to get the transmitter to broadcast at 87.9 that it would work well (this tip does help), however even with the device volume at max and a decent car stereo system at max, the audio is quiet and at times distorted --- if you can find a device that is made specifically for a particular mp3 player, go with that one - if you want this device for different types of mp3 players, then get this, but remember you get what you pay for!"
2,Not the solution I was looking for,"Despite using the International frequency tips mentioned by other reviewers, the transmitter is *frequently* interrupted by ambient radio signals. Further, the sound quality is lousy compared to the tape deck adapters I have used in the past. I bought this to replace an ailing tape deck adapter which would routinely switch sides/eject, causing continued interruptions in my music. Unfortunately, the iTrip suffers from nearly as many interruptions, and the sound quality is worse than the tape adapter when it does work. I ended up buying a new tape adapter for about the same price as this; not looking back. To be fair, none of my complaints are, to my knowledge, specific to the iTrip FM transmitter; I suspect all such transmitters would cause similar issues. For what it is, the iTrip appears to be a good deal; similar transmitters cost something like $60 in retail stores. Still- do yourself a favor and just buy a tape adapter."
3,Works well,"The transmitter works well, just used it on a 3 state trip. The only thing that I'm not pleased with is, the write-up said that it goes down to station 87.9, it doesn't, it only goes to 88.1."
2,Griffin MP3 radio adapter,Good ontime delivery as promised. Not overly impressed with the FM technology as I get quite a bit of hum on the speakers. To be fair I live in a large urban area and the dial is crowded; I haven't tried it in a less populated area.
1,The worst,I've had this for about two weeks and it's already shutting off every 5 minutes. This would be more useful if you chopped off the FM transmitter and wanted to use it as an overpriced USB charger.
3,Good for the price,"Itrip came in a timely manner, works decent for the price and depending on the station selected. Thanks."
4,Reading the reviews makes all the difference!,"Thanks to the helpful reviews here, I set it to international mode and 87.9 right away. I also set all the presets to 87.9, after discovering for myself how annoying it was to have it not remember the setting after being turned off and back on. And the first time it shut itself off, I knew to increase the volume on my mp3 player. So I've seen for myself the issues people complain about, but thanks to other reviewers I had immediate workarounds as solutions, and now have an inexpensive and easy way to listen to mp3s in the car."
3,Does not have internal battery for charging.,The description below the product says that you can charge the transmitter by using a USB drive. This is not correct. You have to have the device plugged into your cigarette lighter for it to work. The USB drive is used to charge your MP3 player while it is plugged into your cigarette lighter.Other than a misleading product description it works well and gives good sound. The signal strength work 90% of the time but sometimes you are constantly changing channels but the preset helps with this.I would recommend if you have working cigarette lighters in your car.
4,I like it.,"I recently got this transmitter after trying several others.This transmitter has very little to no static, depending on where I drive of course.I like that you can choose from many different stations. The sound quality isn't as bad as others I've tried either. I use it with a Microsoft Zune.I am pleased with the product and will keep it."
3,Not for podcasts,I only paid 8 dollars for this transmitter with shipping and I can say that for the price it does work.ProsYou are able to set it to 87.7 which takes out a lot of radio station interference.ConsLike another reviewer stated this is not the best transmitter for spoken word. I mostly listen to podcasts and I have to crank the volume on my Zune to almost full to keep the auto shutoff from kicking in and at that level I start to get distortion on this unit.I also have had random static with this unit on the highway; it will be clear and then if someone with another transmitter passes me or is near this unit is overpowered.If you can get it cheap and only listen to music then this will work but I would not recommend it for audio book or podcast listeners.
3,Doesn't work in big cities,"It doesn't work in big cities. I drove between LA and Las Vegas then to Sedona last month.It worked fine.It sounds good.I only changed the frequency once. But in Las Vegas and in LA where there are many radio stations, it's hard to find right frequency for the transmitter."
3,Works if the dial is not crowded,"This product is easy to use and works well if there are few strong radio signals. In a city where there is a station on almost every frequency, it just doesn't cut it. The sound is crackly and full of static even if there is no clear station at the frequency. Nearby channels seem to interfere. I suspect it puts out a week signal and needs a completely clear channel to work."
2,"Nope, it's going back.","I got this for a road trip, sending the audio from the video screens to the radio... but the crummy weak signal it puts out isn't strong enough to carry to the car antenna. The sound is plauged by static breakup and inconsistent levels across the frequncy range. I have the tranasmitter as far back in the car as possible and the antenna is on the back of my car. The specs say it good up to 10 to 30 feet, antenna to tranmitter in my car is less than 10 feet. I tried clear freqeuncies (no stations to compete with) and even the international range of frequencies (very clear in the US) I tried the stereo and mono options, mono should be a stronger signal, but it wasn't. This product is junk and belongs in christmas crackers."
3,Low signal,"arrived when promised. worked right out of the box, but the signal strength could be better. tried about every station possible, but even that did not successfully give me good sound quality."
1,SUCKS!,SOO..at first i was super stoked when i found out how cheap it was but when i got it and tried it out the signal was terrible. I even used the advice from the other reviews about a stations to use but still it was fuzzy and it lost signal every time i hit a bump on the road. I wouldn't recommend this item..spend a little more cash on a something better cause Ur waisting your time here.
4,"works for me, sometimes.","First thing i did was try it with my cellphone, a Nokia E63 (because of the reviews saying it gets interference from cellphones) but it worked greatly.then my old ipod 4th gen. not so good, deep sounds had too much distortion, I had to set the volume of the ipod very low and turn up the radio, but then the white noise gets too loud, works better with my cellphone.the big pro is the stereo jack, so you can use it with anything, I've used it even with my laptop. And th USB slot, so you can charge while you listen.works better from 87MHz to 89MHz, for some reasons, read the reviews, some persons here explain this device way better than the manual.one con is the weak signal, specially if you dont find a good frecuency, even passing cars can cause interference sometimes.for the price, is a very good product and super easy to use."
3,works but poor sound quality,its easy to use and does what it is supposed to do. however the sound is not clear and it is difficult to find a radio station that doesnt sound fuzzy
3,cheap start to a transmitter for the ipod,It works well for me now as a power supply for the ipod but it didn't transmit very clearly to the stereo. It might just be for my specific car... I ended up getting a tape adapter and using this product for the power feature. At least it was inexpensive.
2,Works with limited capability,"I originally purchased this device years ago (at another retailer) and once I got it into the international mode it worked great. (The power source never worked for me, but I did not have a need for it.) I replaced it because the wire was fraying from so much use. My second purchase of this item was not as good. Although I can still get the device into international mode it frequently shuts off with some songs and stays on with others. It appears to shut off during the slower moving songs. It does not work at all with an audio book. I use this for Sony Walkman and Apple ipod touch/shuffle. I do not recommend this transmitter unless it drops in price (i.e. no more than ten dollars)."
1,Too much static,I also get static when trying to charge and play simultaneously. After reading the reviews I see this is a known problem. The makers need to fix this or at least acknowledge this shortcoming
1,doesn't work in cities or road trips,"This doesn't work in the San Francisco Bay area (too many radio stations). This doesn't work on the drive from SF to LA (not many radio stations for any one part of the trip, but enough stations that I have to keep changing the broadcasting station)."
1,FM Transmitter,"This thing randomly cuts off while I'm driving and causes my stereo to start blasting static, really annoying and it's worthless to use. I have had it for a while and it has cut off like that at least like 50 times or more every two minutes and the audio quality is really poor - waste of money and time fiddling with it."
1,Just get a stereo installed.,"I am really frustrated with this device. I had an iTrip before that connected directly to my iPod, but now that my iPod is defunct I needed something else with which to listen to my music. I've been connecting this to my portable cd player. It seems to work fine for really loud rock music, but if you play anything acoustic or with quiet parts, it will shut off randomly (even if you can hear the music fine from your speakers) and then you have to listen to loud static. So annoying!!! I am getting a cd/mp3 player installed in my car because I am FINISHED with adapters."
1,Really annoyed with this product.,"This thing randomly cuts off while I'm driving and causes my stereo to start blasting static that almost scares me off the road. So if you can imagine, it's really annoying and I don't use it anymore. I have had it for a while and it has cut off like that at least like 50 times or more. I only use it now if there is a song I'm really in the mood for that isn't on anything but my ipod. But yeah, if they're all like this I definitely don't recommend them and the audio quality is really poor but I expected that."
2,It worked but not I'm not very impressed....,"Mannn, I thought that the volume on this adapter was going to stand out but I was wrong. I mean, it does what the manufacturer says it does but it doesn't put out cd volume performance. I don't regret buying it too much but I wished I would've during some more researching on similar items."
2,Griffin I-trip disappointing performance,"I have had an earlier model Griffin Itrip that I really liked but had to replace it because my Otterbox case made the device hard to unplug from my iphone 3GS, so over time, the wires pulled out of the cording and it quit working, so I am a little disappointed in this one. I have the iPhone 5 now and I have to turn the volume up high on my phone and my car stereo to hear the music. I agree with another review that it sounds like the music is coming from a distant radio. It does seem to come in a little better and clearer with my daughters i-touch 4. I have tried several different stations to see if reception improved, but to no avail, it didn't."
1,"Cheap price, Cheap device",You definitely get you pay for. The iTrip just doesn't work as an FM transmitter. I cannot get a decent signal strength that's even remotely static free. I use it strictly as a phone charger now.
2,"Great design, flawed transmitter.","Loved the look of this product, the backlit display and the usb port for charging. I really wanted this to be a good device, but the sound quality was terrible. I may have high expectations, who knows, but I just couldn't listen to music or podcasts without being so frustrated I just turned standard radio on. I am returning this and looking for a different product."
2,Sound quality is not good,I don't want to recommend this product to others.Sound quality is not that good. (noisy...)and cable is thiner looking not that reliable...
3,Needs Tweeking and Patience,"This is a great device. IT IS NOT PERFECT. If you go into it with the mind set this is a band aid for a stereo with a MP3 port you will be better off. You will need to set it to euro mode. This process can be found on the internet. You will need to play with the preset stations for different sides of town. You WILL need to change the stations especially if you live in a big city where there are many stations. One you get this done you will have a decent sound quality, expect about 80% of you device with good ear buds. It is a lot better than carrying 300 CD's in your car or paying $300 for a new stereo."
4,Good Product,I have had some trouble finding a solid radio station but once I found one the adapter is great. I use it on my droid smart phone all the time.
2,Arrived broken,I order this from Amazon retailer BDRoth and it was broken. Be very careful about resellers. The FM transmitter I got was not in the manufacturers packagen. I'm guessing it wasn't new.
2,Cannot disable auto shutoff - don't use for audio books or movies,"This is a run of the mill FM transmitter and the price is very good.Unfortunately, the auto shutoff ""feature"" ruins it for me. I bought this to watch TV/movies on ipod in car. The device will repeatedly shutoff unless you are playing music. Like every minute. The dialogue is insufficient to keep it on. Probably a problem for audiobooks as well.Beware. If you are doing it for music - it seems the same as every other fm transmitter I've ever had - adequate, not great, very dependent on surrounding signals."
1,No signal strength !,"Not worth purchasing. Signal strength is next to nothing with my Sansa clip +, turned all the way up. Even on a clear channel."
2,iTrip is not good in metro Detroit Are,Afterusing this product while driving across metro Detroit ( Macomb County to Washtenaw County) I found that thisFM transmitter has too much static. In the Detroit area it is difficult to find free frequency that will stay free. This means as you drive through other communities you have to retune the device. It may be nice if the device had some presets but then you are still huntin around for a free frequency while driving.So this product should not be used in lare metropolitan areas.
3,Great Deal,"This product is a great deal at its current price, but you get what you pay for, and the sound quality is much too poor for me personally to use this transmitter on a regular basis in my area."
3,Works well wish i didn't live in such a populated area.,"Works well just sucks because from time to time i have to change stations. As with anything there's good and bad in this case however, i wish i didn't live in a large city."
1,Not a keeper,"This was a complete waste of money. Tried taking it to mono and international, and still not a single station can be found that doesn't have a constant crackle. Tried on 2 different vehicles with the same result.Completely unusable in the KC area.. even going as far as Bonner Springs, KS and still.. no clear channels."
3,Overated,"I saw this same FM receiver at best buy for $30. I'm glad I got it off amazon for a tenth of that price because if I had paid $30 for it I would be one upset customer.You get what you pay for. I do like that I can charge my phone and listen to music at the same time (low quality music due to transmission), or just do one or the other."
1,Not worth the money,"I had high expectations of this receiver. I am terribly disappointed.1. The sound is terrible. There is a lot of static and humming. My MP3 music sounds ""muddy"" even though I have adjusted the volume in my MP3 and radio trying to get a better sound.2. The frequency won't hold. I set it on 87.9 but after 2-3 minutes it drifts to 88.1 or such and I have to push the preset button to bring it back to 87.9. (I have all preset to 87.9) It continues to drift every 2-3 minutes. Very annoying!I won't try my luck with another of this type. I am going to buy a portable speaker instead."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this product because I have no other way to hook up my phone/mp3 player to my car head unit (other than a $100 chip that you install into the back of the head unit!).I'm quite disappointed in the sound quality. I've only tried it in and around Pittsburgh. Have gone through all available stations including the international ones such as 87.7 and 87.9, but the sound quality is not acceptable. It is actually better just to play the music through the speaker of my phone.At least it was cheap and didn't set me back too much, or I would be returning it."
2,Product is good but is not new as advertised,The transmitter and charger function well but it is not a brand new product as advertised by the seller (DB ROTH). It is a used product. DO NOT buy from them!!
2,Auto Shut Off.....,Pretty good signal strength and sound. Shuts off after 50 sec--supposed to be after silence but never registered when my Sansa Clip was playing. Makes it non-usable.
4,Good Solution to Apple Screwing You...,"It always bums me out how Apple changes their hook ups every time! So this was a good solution. Now when I get the latest and greatest Apple product I can still charge it and use it via USB. So far it has worked very well. The only issue is if you go through an area that you service has to change... meaning if you lose 3g coverage you start to get that annoying beeping sound. Since it is coming through your speakers it is pretty loud. If I am travelling and don't need my reception on I just go into airplane mode and you get rid of it, but that is about the only annoying thing so far."
5,at first 1 star but than 5,At first 1 star but than 5. But once you put it in international mode and fm frequency 87.9 it is all clear everywhere. Occasionally it will randomly cut off reception and get static. If you don't put it on 87.9 this device is unusable.Does anyone know what is better mono mode or stereo. I seem to hold preference towards mono. Which I find odd.
3,Just OK FM transmitter,"This is my 2nd transmitter in a 6 month period.My 1st was the $5.00 Generic which actually had a much better sound quality than this one. It also charged at the same time. It shorted out after 3 months.I have had this 2 months and would say it's not worth $25 even if it lasts a couple years. The sound is distant and static. you have to bring another cable if you want to charge at the same time.Pros: Well Made buttons, preset stationsCons: Poor sound quality, needs another cable to charge while playing.These things should cost $10 max."
1,Turns off all of the time,"Awful FM Transmitter, it plays horribly through my car's speakers and it also turns off all of the time for no reason at all while I am listening to music! Spend your money on a better transmitter that won't turn off as you're enjoying your music."
1,Just not up to the task,"As simple as it seems to produce a device that transmits a clean FM signal from a box four feet away from an antennae, I have not found a device capable of doing it. The idea of using a frequency just below the standard FM range (where no interference would get in the way) is a great theory if it worked. With this device it does not. The signal was 30% static and wavered in and out just sitting in my garage. I live in an very rural area where receiving commercial radio is difficult so I thought I should be a good candidate for this kind of solution. No solution here."
1,Waste of money,"This transmitter is horrible. I did change it to international mode like other reviews said however it still sounded like crap. It's cheaply made and that was obvious when it finally arrived. I missed the part that said ""all sales final"", so I can't even get my money back. If you're looking for a good transmitter don't buy this one."
3,"Mediocre buy, but good for its price","I live in LA so it's tough to find a clear frequency, even on international mode. You will always hear static no matter what frequency you are on, but it's average quality considering its pretty cheap vs other similar products."
2,should be called the icrap,"I bought this because like most people, I didn't want to buy a new car stero to play my ipod in. I went to set it up and I had some trouble with it. setting it up was a breeze but it took some fiddling around to get a good signal. I finally found that it could play my old hippy folk songs perfectly....but when you add a bass guitar to the song...it fuzzes up and pretty much gives you a static sound. I tried to turn on the bass reducer, but that was no help.It may be my car, but I expected better because it says that it has a 10-30 ft range."
3,decent,Downfall: Can be very staticy and create lots of feedback which takes away from actually hearing the music. It also randomly cuts outs so you have to unplug and then plug back in. When it doesn't do those things it works quite well.
1,Cheap product,"I was encouraged by some favorable reviews, until I received the product. It is one of few universal chargers around. This is the only positive feature. The cord/wire is cheap and creates static anytime it moves or comes into contact with anything. It is a simple product but somehow not very easy to use. The FM transmitter, even on international and mono modes, is very weak. The signal was unintelligible less than 18 inches from the receiver. I'm looking for a product to use with the new ipods, but this is no solution. Really a bad product."
3,sound is only average,The sound is only average. I have to turn the sound on my mp3 player almost all the way up and turn the car stereo up quite a bit as well. I wouldn't say it is CD quality but it sure beats static on some longer trips where radio reception is poor.
2,Apparently unusable in city environments,I can't find any unused stations in my area that are clean enough to get a good signal with this device.
1,Static In More Ways Than One,"This transmitter should be taken off the market! The connector did not fit the lighter properly, which seemed to create excessive static; it was completely useless. After several emails to IPodAccs, they agreed to send me an upgrade once I provided payment to cover the upgrade difference. The upgrade works okay, but is not close to the quality of the previous transmitter that I lost recently. If I had to do it again, I would pay the extra money to receive the best quality possible; you get what you pay for when it comes to this type of product. I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed that they were initially unwilling to resolve the problem, however, after a litte persistence, they conceded. With that said, I didn't have to involve Amazon."
2,TRANSMITTER,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. THIS ITEM WAS CHEAP AND WHEN I PLUGGED IT INTO MY IPOD I ALWAYS HEARD STATIC. I HAD TO HANG MY IPOD ON TO MY SUN VISOR IN ORDER TO GET SOME TYPE OF SIGNAL. I STOPPED USING THIS AND UPDATING TO A BETTER TRANSMITTER EVEN THOUGH IT COST MORE!
1,Don't Bother,Don't bother buying this inexpensive Griffin iTrip Universal FM Transmitter and Charger for MP3 Players. It doesn't work even with the international setting that another reviewer said worked great. The static from this device is overwhelming despite trying to find every unused FM station on the digital dial. It's a piece of junk and not worth the $18 I paid for it. I would not recommend buying anything from ShopCell their return policy is only for 30 days and it's terrible. I would also be very careful when buying anthing from Amazon Marketplace it is usually items that are cheap and defective. Buyer beware!!! In fact giving this item and ShopCell a one star is being generous. 1 star is too high a rating. I wasted my money buying this item.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Even for a low cost item such as this, it is a blatant rip off and the sellers know it. I have to constantly change the channel on it and you cannot get the static noise out of your speakers if you tried. The static is so high pitched it over powers the music at times. Rip off Product. Save your money."
4,Turn down volume on Ipod,"Works well with my ipod nano 4th gen...just turn down the volume to about 1/2 or it will sound really bad over your car stereo. The sound is OK, but a bit flat."
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"While thoughtfully engineered, this product has so many flaws that I went back to a cassette adapter."
3,It's ok...,After moving it around quite a bit to find just the right spot were it wouldn't static it was alright. I do like the fact that it is universal and works with my ipod as well as my sansa.
4,Midpriced portable alternative,"Purchased this before a few long trips last year.Well worth the money spent. It has 4 presets (use the 2nd set of FM presets you never use on the car radio to match up with it). And with the usb jack you can recharge a variety of devices.Is it as good as an input jack, no. Is it a good option if you don't have one, yes.When I took several long trips (1000 plus miles) it only washed out when I was near very large (read Chicago) cities. Otherwise all I normally needed to do was switch to a different station.The best thing about the transmitter is that it works with my daughter's mp3 player, my mp3 player, my wife's PSP, and any other mp3 player we're likely to buy in the near future."
1,Unusuable Product,"This product works by sending an FM broadcast to your stereo's antenna, where it's received by your car. In theory the signal broadcast should be strong enough to overpower ambient FM radio signals. In an urban or suburban environment, this is not the case. The sound quality is highly distorted at best, even when you set it on the FM station with the weakest broadcast signal in your area. My advice to you: unless you're living on the North Pole, do not purchase this product."
3,"It's ok, I guess..",I guess I didn't expect TOO much since it was only 25 bucks or so. But still... the static is very annoying and changing to a different frequency every 5 min or so is also annoying. 3/5 overall
4,Great device!,"It seems everyone who has written a review either loves this thing or hates it. I'm in the former category. I plugged it in, found a couple blank stations, programmed it and have had no problems. At the price at which it was purchased I may even get a couple more for other cars. It may not be outstanding, but it does a respectable job - especially considering the price."
4,good value,I bought this to use with my 2004 honda acoord because I can't use cassette adapter. works very well with my sony walkman. sometimes I get some interference & static but it's not that bad. Would recommend it if you don't have aux input or cassette in ur car.
3,It's Unreliable,"When I first used it, it was great, started out perfect with great clarity. As I continued to used it a few more times I started getting weird frequency sounds, then it would just not pick it up at all. I'm not sure if there's something wrong with the one I got, but it's rather disappointing to get into my car hoping to listen to my new favorite song, only to find major major static issues."
4,This works,"I bought this for like 6 dollars, 12 by the time I payed shipping. At first I was very disappointed as I thought the sound quality was awful. Turns out, if you have you're IPOD too loud, it sounds awful. Just turning the level down a couple notches and it works fine. The sound quality isn't great by any measure, but for the price I can't complain."
1,don't buy,"I have an internal antenna, so maybe I just didn't get it close enough to it. I couldn't get this to work at all without so much static you couldn't even hear the song. I was very disappointed."
4,Great way to listen to and charge your Android on the go,This is the second iTrip I've purchased. The first one lasted a year before being stepped on in the car. These work great to broadcast your music in most cars or vans while giving you a USB port for a quick charge on the go. The only thing I would improve on the product is a better way to store the wires while in use. Would recommend this to anyone.
1,sounds like crap and keeps shutting off,well the title pretty much covers it! i did all the setup stuff correctly and just couldnt get this thing to sound right. finally i just stuck it in my work truck for when i gotta drive out of town. very unimpressed
1,Junk,"I have owned another Griffen Itrip for 2 ears and i love it and it a quality product. Too bad this is not that, right out of the package the sound is just fuzzy. it doesn't matter how clean the radio station is. Really, it is just unusable."
2,"A good price, but outweighed by cheap quality!","This is an edit to a previous review. Originally, I rated this product 3 stars for its nice price but I ""thought"" it was a little on the cheap side. Sadly, my gut instinct was correct as this item quickly deteriorated and would no longer charge my Iphone as the light just kept flashing on and off between red and green as to say there was an issue. Battery power never went up and the device malfunctioned within 3 uses. Do not recommend."
2,Good while it lasted,This FM Transmitter worked great for my iPhone and my wife's iPod shuffle... for the 3 months it lasted. I would recommend getting a different brand.
5,It works,"One of the better ones I've had. Probably should have spent my money on a car with a less crappy antenna though. This was cheaper than a new car though, so it won."
4,Excellent for the price,"I bought this FM transmitter not expecting anything great. I was actually surprised how well it works - especially for the price. (close-out sale $2.99 plus shipping!) It is easy to set up and use and has worked flawlessly for about a month now. The sound quality isn't perfect (better than AM, not as good as FM radio) but if you have an EQ on your mp3 player you can get pretty good sound with it. Sometimes my car stereo starts to pick up a distant station and it causes some static. A quick change of the channel usually fixes it. The range on this unit is surprisingly good - about 75 feet. My wife was able to receive my ""broadcast"" while driving her car behind me without much static. I've never tried the USB charger jack so I cannot comment on that part. Overall a very good buy for the money."
2,Bad sound quality and a lot of glitchs,"First of all, it sounds really bad. All FM stations sounds MUCH better than this device. I was trying to play with equalizer on my player, but it didn't really help.Second of all, this transmitter always switch frequency without any actions on my side. This makes it pretty useless."
3,"It works well, but know the limitations.","The product works, but I get static and interference in some areas. It also depends on the position of the item and the reception of your vehicle. I have a built-in antenna in the windsheild of my car, so static from a station gets picked up in my transmitter.I download podcasts and songs, so it is very convenient. It is a pain to drive for a couple of hours and have to chainge stations in an area, but I still like it."
2,poor quality all around,"Compared to two other transmitters that I have owned, this product by far was the worst. The sound quality is fuzzy and it has already quit working altogether after one week of use. Now all I use it for is a car charger. CRAP."
3,mostly pleased,i really liked how clear it sent the signal to the radio and that you can use any fm radio station to send the signal to. eventually it started to cut out (lose signal)every 20-30 minutes needing unplugged from the cigarette lighter and plugged back in.
3,FM Transmitter,"Easy to use. Preset channels make it easy to locate a clear channel in a new town. Loses some sound quality, but with all the road noise, it does not bother me. I had to turn the volume down on my MP3 player, or the sound is muffeled. Cheap and easy way to listen to your tunes while driving."
1,Does not work with the iPod Shuffle,"There is wire coming out of the unit that is so close to the USB socket that you cannot plug in an iPod Shuffle, except perhaps with a USB extention cord, so the 'recharge in car' feature is moot.The sound quality is unlistenable except out in the countryside - far too weak a signal.Off to the trash!"
3,"It's good, but not CD quality","I like this item because it's very easy to use. You pick a number on the dial and match the setting of the iTrip and just plug in your MP3 player. Sometimes, the reception gets a little static like a radio station not coming in all the way. Eventually, I'm going to figure out how to plug my MP3 player into the sound system, however, the car is newer and I haven't had a chance to do that yet. This is ok for now."
1,Bad Bad Reception...,"I stay in New Jersey. This device 'works' worse than a ten-dollars model I bought off eBay last year.There are too much static and basically I can only vaguely hear the music from my player when my car is not moving. Once I'm on the move, static just took over and I no longer hear anything anymore.I tried pressing every other button to tune it, but this just does not work.I do not recommend buying this product."
1,Not worth it,"I tried this with 2 different phones and 3 different radios only to find that the sound and signal were HORRIBLE! I have used fm transmitters before and never had one this bad. There was one built into my last phone and it was incredible. You would think one built outside of a phone would be even better, but not this one! I know the price seems to good to pass up, but it's not worth the anger you'll feel when you can't use it."
2,You definitely get what you pay for.,"I saw raving reviews about this product - AND it was cheap! I previously had a COBY Transmitter that I was trying to replace. It had a short in it and the sound had deteriorated significantly. However, the sound of the COBY was still better than the sound in the iTrip. Now, if this is your first FM Transmitter and you have nothing else to compare it to, then you may think that it is wonderful! But trust me, with this product, you get what you pay for. I paid about $10 for my COBY FM Transmitter and I plan to purchase another one. I would return the iTrip - but for $2? Not so much!"
1,"Works but sounds is ""flat""","The sound quality I received though this device (even in international mode) was ""flat"" and not enjoyable to listen to. I expected at least radio quality however that was not the case. A huge difference is seen when listening to music through the itrip then switching over to a radio station with good reception. I am planning on trying another FM transmitter with a different manufacture."
2,"product not so good, seller wonderful",product not so good but the seller was super nice & tried to help as much as possible. he did everything in his power to make me satisfied with the product but the product didn't work. ={ the charger part of the item works on iPod touches but not always on iPhones. the fm transmitting part didn't work. you cant hear the words. you only hear a back beat & even that is very fuzzy. you can only hear the words if the song has no beat & it is just spoken word.
4,fm transmitter,"i got mine used so it was only 6$ after shipping and they delivered next day. its easy to find a radio station with the selection buttons, my only problem is i get a lot of signal noise. i think it may be coming from my cell phone which i use as an mp3 player so i guess thats my problem not the transmitter, but for the money this is really the best thing out there. i'm very happy with my purchase."
2,itrip fm transmitter,i read other reviews for this product and so thats why i bought it..however once i got it most of the channels have too much static. i am unhappy with this product.
2,Requires a USB cord for charging,"This device does play your iPhone through the radio, but you have to use a separate USB cord to do the charging. I would suggest finding a device that only requires one plug-in instead of two.Also, I read from an expert that you can actually use third-party accessories designed for recent iPod models with the iPhone. When those devices are used, you might get this message: ""This accessory is not made to work the iPhone"" or ""This accessory is not supported by iPhone."" It will then give you the option of putting the iPhone into AirPort mode. But you can ignore that option, or you click yes.I didn't realize before ordering this charger that I could use the DLO charge and player that I have for my 5th generation iPod. I get the message that it was not made to work with the iPhone, but it actually does with no problem."
1,FM transmitter for IPOD,This product did not work in my Blazer. The result was excessive static. Amazon was good about returning it.
1,worst radio adapter i've ever used!,"I'm done with trying to find a good radio adapter for my ipod, none of them work! This one was especially horrible, I could only hear the fuzzy bass. No words, no guitar, nothing! I wish they'd make them like they used to..."
1,poor result,This FM device wooks very poorly in metro areas. I mean poorly. Maybe out in the country towns with only a couple of transmitting stations it would work as advertised. don;t waste $$ otherwise
1,Griffin iTrip Universal FM Transmitter,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JV9NL2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI have an '07 Honda Accord Coupe with an XM radio antenna. No matter what frequency I select I cannot get clear, static free reception. I've tried every possible orientation of the device trying to align the transmitting antenna with the receiving antenna."
2,Not for me,"I read a lot of the reviews here before buying this. So, I knew there could be problems if you live in a larger area with a lot of stations. But, this thing worked terrible for me, when I first tried it yesterday. The few stations I found that would work, would work intermittently. It would sound fine, then as it went out of stereo, for whatever reason, it wouldn't.Also, read and knew about changing it to international mode, as described here. That was an exercise in frustration. Perhaps I'm missing something? When I hold down Preset, and it goes from 1, to XL, then to US, nothing happens when I hit + or -.I'm sending this thing back, and getting a cassette adapter for my MP3 player.Wish I'd known more at the time, as both my cars have cassette players"
2,static,I got alot of static from this transmitter.It got worse as I pressed the gas peddle.I think it depends on your vehichle too.My friend has no problem with his.Amazons policy of free shipping (buying & returning) made it real easy.
3,So so.,"the FM transmitter is alright i guess, there is alot of static when driving. If i knew it would be like this i wouldn't have gotten it."
2,WORKS (minimally),"As soon as i plugged in my iPod Touch and found a station, it worked perfectly. I was quite skeptical of the quality of the product, and was pleasantly surprised to hear ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" in almost crystal clarity. That was until the car began moving. At that point, static took over and there was no music to be heard. Since then, I have spent many car rides searching for viable channels, to no avail. At best, it is like listening to a cassette recorded from an old, scratched record. I even tried the international option, but I found that the stations deemed as the solution all had radio broadcasting loud and clear through them. I only payed $8 including shipping for this item retailed for $50 elsewhere, but it was still quite a disappointment."
2,just so so,The frequency selected (such as 87.7) is not stable. It will automatically stoped 3 minutes after frequency set.
4,Great little product,"I use this with my Sansa Clip and it works great, clip stays charged and the FM tuner in the middle of the cord makes it easy to change the station on long trips."
2,Not a fan...,"I think FM transmitters are a crap shoot. Some will work better in certain cars and certain areas. This one did not work well for me (04 Mustang, South NJ). Someone else I know had this one also, and it didn't work well in their Mazda Tribute or Toyota Camry. The signal was very static-y on every single frequency I tried. I eventually bought one by Monster and I love it."
4,Very nice,"This works as well or better than advertised. Finding a working frequency was a snap, and we rarely had tuning problems. Certainly recommended."
2,Ok sound but not enough power,"The sound is decent enough, although not great. I was disappointed to find that it didn't produce enough power through the USB connector to charge my HTC Hermes (aka TyTN, ATT 8525 etc)."
3,Great convenience,"Listening to my MP3 music on my car radio is a pleasure. A lot more convenient than fiddling with CDs. I use playlists on my Sansa e260 and plug the Griffin into the headphone jack.I must admit at times the signal is weak and it sounds like a radio station at the edge of it's range. But for the price, it's hard to beat."
1,Very weak radio signal; picks up static,"This is the worst FM transmitter I've used. The radio output is very weak, and I mostly hear static, even in my small town and on the open highway. I've tried many different stations with no improvement. I replaced this with theXm Auto Cassette Adapterand haven't looked back."
3,good price but not a consistent product,Bought 2 of these for both of my cars. One works fine but other does not - it keeps turning off. Changing the preset channels is a bit tricky also. Overall an ok product for the price. Good that it can charge the ipod at the same time.
2,Almost no chance to use it.,"Well, ideally Ok, but practlcally, we almost don't have to use this, maybe used only one time.Anyhow thanks.Sung K."
4,mp3 transmitter,Works just like stated. Only drawback is on long trips having to find a new clear station.
3,Ok for the price,"Item works ok. It's just what you need but don't expect too much from it. Works fine but always capture statics. Mine works only in one station without too much problems but it does get noisy annoying sometimes. Then again, item is ok for the price."
1,Defective? I'll never know..,"I had the same problem as one other reviewer... The thing kept shutting off. I was playing my iPod through it and it kept shutting off. Extremely frustrating. So much that I just tossed it out the window. So I'm guessing it was defective but whatever I'll never know cause I can't return it now.From when it was on the sound quality was as good as my old one. I put it into international mode so I could get it to use 87.7-9, and it had good enough sound quality for me.However with the shutting off issue I think I'm just going to spend the money to get a new deck for my car with an auxillery in. My old car had that and it saved a lot of money, time, and hassle trying to deal with FM transmitters."
1,J.U.N.K.,"My transmitter arrived today and was total junk. didn't work on 87.9, or 87.7, or any other suggested frequencies suggested in these ""5"" star ratings, EVEN on international setting. Even when I could get the signal halfway clear, the audio was total garbage, no bass and max distortion."
5,Chrystal Clear Music through the Radio,"I bought this to listen to music on my way to school and work because my car only has a cd player and radio. This was the only way to connect my iPod to the car. This one looked perfect for me because not only would it broadcast my music over the radio, it would also charge my iPod!Out of the box the station 87.7 was not available and it was broadcasting in LX mode.To unlock 87.7: hold the preset button until you can switch from US mode to INTL mode. Now it is unlocked.You want 87.7 because no one broadcasts on that station. You will get minimal interference.To unlock DX mode: Hold the preset button until you can switch from LX to DX mode. Now it is in DX mode.You want DX mode because it broadcasts on channel of sound in DX mode. Before it was broadcasting two weak channels of sound, but now it is broadcasting one strong channel.Configuring your iTrip with these tweaks will result in crystal clear listening!"
1,Extremely poor quality,"I own 2 different items like this, and this is quite frankly a piece of trash. It does not fit the iphone correctly unless your willing to cut the rubber around the connector. Save your money and buy something else."
3,Good bang for the buck,"I bought this so I could listen to my mp3 player in my car which doesnt have a 3mm plug. Ive had wireless fm transmitters in the past, so I expected the typical static, engine interference, and other various noises. This product gives you all those things - but all wireless fm transmitters Ive had have done it.For the price, you cant go wrong. Its small, out of the way, easy to use, doesnt require batteries, AND it charges your mp3 player. If you can find a good clear station, youll get decent sound. Just be prepared for the random noises and dont expect CD quality sound."
1,FM transmitter works poor in Sacramento with iPod Shuffle,"FM transmitter works poor in Sacramento with iPod ShuffleVery difficult to get clear ""open"" signal - either with US or Int'l setting. I regret the purchase."
1,Griffen FM transmitter,I could not get my MP3 player to sound clear through my car stereo. I live about 15 miles from downtown Chicago. Maybe I'm too close to the big city for the product to work.
2,Stay away...,"This thing is horrible. I wanted to like it, it looks nice, it has great features, but the sound quality is horrible. The highs are just not there. It sounds like someone turned the treble down half way. But that's not the worst part; the thing turns off every 1 to 2 minutes. This is an energy saving feature which turns the unit off when it doesn't sense a signal, which is all well and good, but it doesn't work! The threshold is set way too high so it constantly turns itself off unless you have your player turned all the way up, causing horrible distortion. Do yourself a favor and get something else..."
3,Works well sometimes,"The sounds quality isn't great, and the only way to get a clear signal is to be miles away from any city. Otherwise, it is really difficult to find a radio station where the transmitter will not be interrupted by lots of intermittent static."
3,Pretty good overall,"Works as described, so for the money it's pretty nice. I recommend doing what others have suggested about changing the mode to ""INT"" to allow access to lower frequencies (87.9, for example). I recently used it on a long trip and it did just fine, even through some large cities, with only occasional and brief static.My only beef is the auto shut-off, which can be maddening for ""softer"" songs. It turns itself off after 30 or so seconds when it doesn't ""hear"" music. It only requires the pressing of one-button to turn back on, so the actual delay depends on how quickly you can hit the button. I wish this so-called ""feature"" could be disabled or the sensitivity adjusted. That's what's keeping it at 3 stars, not 4."
1,Not worth the price,"I was very disappointed when I plugged in the transmitter and only heard the music for a few minutes before I had to start scanning for stations. Living in a city poses problems- there are few open stations to tune into. I tried setting it to international stations as another reviewer suggested, but that did not help. Maybe if I lived in a rural area, I might have been able to tune in. But I cannot imagine having to keep changing channels when driving long distances. I returned the transmitter and bought a $6 adapter to plug into my car's stereo system."
3,Good but Sensitivity is not the best,I purchased this to play my Sansa Fuze in my car. It worked fine BUT there was a sensitivity issue. If the device does not detect a signal after about 50 seconds(I believe) it shuts off. This happend frequently. Not with rock/pop music but with more classical or folk music. I even turned the volume up a high as it could go on my fuze but on many songs it would still shut off automatically. I returned it(Thanks Amazon) and purchased the FM transmitter specifically for the Sansa devices and it works great. I would recommend getting a device that is specific to your iPod/MP3 player versus the Universal device if you listen to music that is softer such as Classical or Folk.
4,Works great for me,"I agree with a previous reviewer who says that these things (regardless which model) will work better in certain cars than in others. The Griffin iTrip works very well in my car ('00 Saturn, Pioneer CD deck, in South Central WI). I made the mistake of not getting a deck with an Aux jack when I purchased a new one in Fall 2005, but I didn't yet have an mp3 player at the time and had no intention of purchasing one.... little did I know!On the other hand, I had previously on 2 occasions bought one of the Belkin Tunecast models and they were both wretched, and were promptly returned both times. Yet, based on the reviews, they seem to work well for some people.The price on the Griffin seems to be coming down, so definately give it a try. And you can even charge your mp3 player on the go with your own USB cable!"
4,"Great design, easy to use, may lack power.","This is a beautifully designed accessory and is very easy to use. Only downside I have come across is a lack of power, I feel like the radio on it could be a little bit stronger resulting in cleaner performance. The built in usb charger is a great feature."
3,"Nice design, but the signal is not strong enough","Nice design, but the signal is not strong enough. I have checked all FM frequencies, but my radio still pickups up statics sounds."
1,Very Poor Reception,"I have an older 2009 version and it works great, so I bought 2 more of the iTrip Auto Universal Plus as gifts in April 2010. Both were terrible. Don't waste your money and the hassle and expense of a return. Since they were not defective due to shipping you have to deal with Griffin, not the seller or Amazon. No channel works even when I leave the metro area and go out into the country. We used these in 3 different vehicles and other FM radio stations interfered across the entire FM dial and you hear the buzzing of your engine as you drive. Very poor quality. Save your money and use your earbuds. BJ."
2,be careful,"This product is just fine if you don't mind static. It have a lot of chanels to use, by finding one that's always clear is hard. Changing the channel on the radio and the device is not easy while driving. So you end up with poor quality from time to time. When it works it works well but it doesn't work all the time."
2,What Happened?,I had one these transmitters before by that same company and it woked fine. This one that I have now doesn't work at all. I went through every station on the radio and I found NO clearity.
4,Pretty good transmitter,This is the 3rd transmitter I've tried in the last few months and it is by far the best of the 3. It works so much better than the $30 Arielle that I had to return. I still get a little static here and there but overall it does a good job. And I did switch over to the the Int'l mode as mentioned in a prior review so I could set it on 87.7. So far no major problems. Glad I got it a couple of weeks ago though when it was only $10.49. But even at $17 it's still a good buy.
2,I tripped,"I bought this FM transmitter expecting it to be a high quality product, but, I was mistaken. The sound quality is terrible, the static that is experienced while trying to listen to your music is annoying, bordering on infuriating. Although it is easy to tune the Itrip to the frequency of your radio, even at night with its nice backlit lcd screen, I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy listening to their MP3 while driving in their car."
4,Very practical,"I bought it for my iphone so I can listen to the ipod and use it as hand-free speaker phone.I am using FM 90.5 band without any problem( NY city metropolitan area). The sound quality is very good except when I drive through a high interference area.Overall, it is practical and easier to use than the ear phone"
4,works great if you can find a free channel,This product is easy to use and has a usb port you can charge your MP3 play while you listen to music. One strange thing ( and it is probably my car radio) the frequency they recommend doesn't exist on my car also I live in an area where there are very few if any unused frequencies. When I do find one the sound is usually clear. All in all worth the money.
2,It's no Soundfly SD,I bought this dirt cheap unit to try before spending more money on the Satechie Soundfly SD. The unit is noisy and subject to drop-out and hiss. Buy the Soundfly SD instead...I just did...and it rocks!
1,This is not a good product,"When I use this in the mornings, the signal is decent, with some static. In the afternoons, all I get is static. I like a little more consistency and efficiency with the products I buy, so I'm returning this one and hopefully getting something that will work."
2,Should have spent a few dollars more.,"The radio signal keeps going bad and I have to find a new station. My understanding is that the other one, the one that cost a few dollars more is much better. Spend the extra money."
5,Works great -- but only if you use it correctly,"I bought this for a long Uhaul trip. Worked like a charm. A few notes however: it's not going to work as well in an urban environment -- too many competing signals. In all cases, try to use the international option -- you get to use channels that are usually clear. Also, if you don't plug your ipod/phone/whatever into the charger the transmitter will go to sleep every minute or so. Very annoying, but easily avoided if you are always plugging in your device. Last, you'll need to play with the volume on your device to get an optimal signal -- too loud and the sound will clip."
4,Perfect for the use,"I got this product shortly after the 120 gig Zune was released and couldn't be happier with it. All I wanted was a transmitter that would play and charge at the same time which this does. Living in close proximity to New York City (Central New Jersey), there are very few frequencies you can set one of these devices to. You can go from 88.1 to 107.9. I found 107.9 to be the best. You have to adjust the volume of the Zune down and play with the radio volume to avoid distortion but that's about it. No other issues.The reason I am replacing this unit is because the wiring at the end is coming loose due to wear and tear. I can be quite rough on these things. However for the price and the fact I don't use memory cards or flash drives this is the unit for me. Simple and to the point. It works. A good product. I couldn't find this in any of the big box stores and don't want to pay 50 or 75 dollars for something I don't need so good thing for Amazon and Prime Shipping!! The happy husband."
1,Junk,"Product worked fine for two months, this week out of the blue the charging portion completely stopped working. Kind of defeats the purpose. Would not purchase again, wasted my money."
1,Terrible reception,"I previously owned a similar Griffn iTrip product and hoped that this one would be of the same high quality. It does not live up to expectations. The sound quality is simply terrible as it is unable to transfer clear sound to the speaker. Instead, what accompanies the music, etc, is a noise that can only be described as constant high-pitched radio interference. And, yes, I have tried every open frequency in an attempt to find the best reception. This is just not a good product. I would keep looking. I still am."
2,"Great build quality, poor performance","This is a great looking product, but the looks are deceiving. The sound quality was way off. Couldn't properly adjust the volume to reach the best/most output from my car's sound system. The product also picked up engine noise, such as humming when idle and humming when revving. Had to buy an alternative (cheaper build product) that works perfectly now."
1,TRASH!,"I didn't like it at all!!It had like an ""interference."" Every time I used it, it played the music into my car radio, but if I touch the transmitter, I could hear every touch in the radio, as well. TRASH!"
4,Great transmitter,"This is a great transmitter for your car! Follow instructions of the other reviewers (about switching into international mode and back) to get 88.7/88.9 and not have the transmitter turn off because of the power saver (which is annoying, but avoidable by switching back to US mode). It's had good signal strength so far, little problems with static, and has a USB port for charging devices."
2,staticy...weak,in relatively urban area i could not get even decent sound from this device.....USB charging port burned out after a few weeks but transmitter still works...not pleased all...there are much better options for this type of device..avoid this one
3,It worked and stopped,"It worked for almost a year and basically stopped working one day. Then again started working. Even though the storage and usage was very carefull and always kept inside the glove compartment.It picks up lot of noise like the mobile phone signals when connected to a cellphone to play music or to talk on callsOtherwise it does its job pretty decent.The stereo quality is not up there. When I played the same MP3 player using an AUX cable, could notice the huge difference in stereo quality."
1,Sucks!,"This product just sucks. The design is really nice. I liked the fact that it has an additional USB port so I can plug an additional cord in to charge my phone as I am listening to Pandora. However, it doesn't matter how convenient the USB port is or how nice it looks if the transmitter never catches ANY clear stations. I tried EVERY station and ended up returning it and purchasing the Monster brand transmitter for a little more money. The monster brand one works GREAT!"
1,"Barely Works, Broke Quickly","Product was received quickly, but unfortunately it also died quickly. Out of the box it worked reasonably well, not amazing signal strength (even at 87.9), but it was adequate for what I was expecting if not slightly worse that other transmitters I've had.However, after about 3 hours of use the transmitter barely functioned. It was noticeably worse than at first, even in the same location, with the same equipment, etc.I do not recommend this product at all."
2,You may be disappointed,"In my area of the country, there are not many open spaces on the fm dial at all. I've tried fm transmitters before, only to be disappointed because there wasn't enough room to allow for clear transmission. I'm in Tulsa, OK.Since it's been several years since I tried, I thought perhaps the technology had improved enough for this one to be different. Sadly, that is not the case. I have no doubt that this is a fine fm transmitter *if you live in an area where there is not a lot of radio reception*."
3,Griffin iTrip Review,"It works well, but I have to turn the volume up really high in my car and my iPod volume is about 3/4 as high as it goes. Any higher on my iPod and it sounds scratchy, but turning up my stereo volume gives a weird static noise, mostly only heard when a song is not playing, or if the song itself is quiet."
5,Griffin iTrip Universal FM transmitter,Excellent reception the only problem is when using the BB app for listening to radio sometime hums.
4,Very pleased with this!,"This product is easy to use.....just find a station, set the Itrip to that same station and voila! your music through your radio. The only issue I have had with this product is some static (not all the time) and a low humming in between songs. Other than that, I'm pleased with the quality and price."
1,Worthless,This product is not what expected no matter where i go no matter what station even the international channels still have static
2,Horrible,"As soon as I took it out of my mail box, I went straight to my car so I could test it out. The sound was bad, until I adjusted to volume on my Sansa Clip and radio. Then, the sound was perfect...had a very clear signal. I only used the transmitter for 2 or 3 minutes. So yesterday, which was my second time using it, the sound was horrible! There was this irritating humming noise, and the humming only got faster and high pitched as I proceeded to drive. I tried using several other stations to see if the humming would stop...but it didn't. I changed from US to INTL mode...that didn't help either. I also changed from DX to LX...and NOPE that didn't work as well. So basically, I will be sending this back tomorrow. I surely do hate that my Monster FM Transmitter stop working all of the sudden, but due to poor customer service I was forced to search for another FM Trasmitter. Well...I guess my search continues."
3,stops transmitting,The device will stop transmitting at irregular intervals. It is very annoying. When it doesn't stop working it has no other issues.
4,Griffin makes great FM transmitters,"This product offers great value for money. Simple to use, good transmission quality. I have had it for about a week now and have been quite satisfied. There is occasional background noise that requires the transmitter to be moved around a little and/or channel changed but that is true of all FM transmitters."
2,Works well but doesn't work long,"The product works really well, but after continual use, it just randomly stops working. You have to pull it out of the jack, and then plug it back in. The signal strength is really good, and its extremely easy to use, but it doesn't work consistently. I really like the sound quality, however."
1,Worthless Piece of Crap,"This device is utterly worthless. I bought one for the car and any music that I listened to with any thick textures was hardly recognizable. Lots of static, lots of noise, horrible. Also, the cigarette lighter plug would come unplugged after going over bumps in the road. It's amazing that I didn't kill myself or someone else between Boulder and Denver while trying to find a frequency that didn't make Modest Mouse sound like screaming zombies. This might work OK in the boonies where there aren't a lot of closely spaced radio stations, but if you plan on using this in the city buy something else."
2,WAS REALLY RUDE WHEN THEY RESPONDED TO MY LAST EMAIL.,"""I RECEIVED THE ITEM BUT IT DID NOT WORK. I CONTACTED THE SELLER AND THE SELLER IS SENDING A REPLACEMENT. I RECONTACTED THE SELLER TO MAKE SURE ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS AND THE RETURN EMAIL WAS IN MY OPINION VERY RUDE."""
2,No 87.9???,"Works fine, but it is pretty disappointing that the tuner starts at 88.1 instead of 87.7 or 87.9."
2,i got it broken!,"I got my package on time, so I can't say anything bad about the shipping. But less than a week after getting my itrip, it didn't charge my ipod while it was playing in my car!"
1,"Don't buy it, it's out of stock with no backorder date",I placed the order on the Dec 14th. Now it's the 28th. The order goes to some Automotive supply store called Midway. The web site still shows there are 5 in stock. But the item was back ordered. I called Midway today and they can't tell me when the order will be filled.
4,Griffin I Trip Auto transmitter,The product came packaged as noted. The only thing misleading was it didn't note that a separate power supply was needed to charge the MP3 player.
1,"If you're buying this for your iphone, don't bother.. it doesn't work","I bought this device primarily for my iphone, as the iphone is listed as one of the supported players. It was suppose to be an all in one device, i.e charger and player; but, after carefully reading the enclosed directions, I couldn't even get the device to charge or play the iphone. It may work on an mp3 player, but I'm not taking my chances."
2,Use as a last resort,"The Griffin iTrip Universal Transmitter and Charger does work once you find a station that doesn't get interference from radio broadcasts. I didn't realize when I purchased this that the sound quality would be so bad though. Reading about FM transmitters, this probably isn't any worse or better than any other FM transmitter. If you don't mind your music sounding like it is being played through a thin pillow, you really can't go wrong for the price of this item."
1,Griffin I-Trip,This product does not work near as well as expected. Certain days it works well and then other days it does not work well at all. I would not purchase this product again.
1,Don't bother!,"I had the griffen itrip for my ipod, it went on top of the ipod itself. That one was pretty hard to work but once you got it synced up with a radio station, it worked well. This one is not even worth it. When it syncs up to the station you can still hear static the whole time. I have tried every station possible and it doesn't matter. Pluse I have to place the zune in a certain spot in my car or the static is too terrible to listen to. The charger works well, but the part that plugs into the cigerette lighter gets really warm, almost hot. I believe you're better off buying these items separately. I don't even bother using the griffen part anymore, it is just too fusterating. I am just going to buy a radio with a direct mp3 imput."
1,"not bad, but not good for me","When I am driving my dogs settle, but as soon as I stop or get out of the car they move about, so the purpose of this product, for me, was to contain the dogs while I'm not in the car. Unfortunately it took less than one minute for them to figure out that if they pulled the screen the elasticized top would move and allow them to jump into the front seat (and eat my lunch!). Perhaps this product would work for those whose animal(s) require only a visual barrier to deter or restrict their movement, but it was not at all effective for confining my two adventurers."
1,For SUV - Hooks to outside luggage tracks,"I have a small car - the item I got in the mail says ""New larger version"" this is for an SUV or truck - it doesn't hook to the inside of the car it actually hooks to the luggage tracks outside on the roof of the car. I couldn't get it to fit in my car and my dog got stuck in it and looked like a fish caught in a net. NOT GOOD!!! He could have been hurt or gotten hung up in it, the mesh is very large!!!"
1,backseat rider net,Completely useless unless you have a very small dog. All the dog has to do is push on the net with his paws and he's able to climb right over. Waste of money.
1,Pet car mesh barrier doesn't work,"Ethical - Spot Backseat Rider Net Car Mesh Barrier for PetsThought this item might help keep my rowdy dogs from trying to climb into the front seat of the truck with me, but I was wrong. I've stopped using it because the dogs kept getting stuck in the mesh, and the mesh will not stay taught between the seats, even when pulled tightly. Maybe I can use it to tie down cargo in the truck bed instead..."
4,Good product!,"I have a 2008 Toyota Camry and I was a little unsure where I'd hook it up. I also have a 75 lb. golden retriever who loves to ride on the console between the 2 front seats, or try to get in the passenger seat.I was able to attach it to the bottoms of my front seats (around the legs) and also to the 'handles' on my ceiling. I had to pull it extremely tight to get it at the height I needed, but it still sags in the middle. I think I have to play around with the tighteners that are shown on the back of the box and then it will be taut on the top. I have tried the dog seatbelt, and the dog hammock. Neither of these have kept my dog in the back seat. This net has done a good job so far. I'm happy that I bought it and think it's a good deal for the price."
1,Easy Installation?,"I'm not sure how well this product works because I can't install it. The thing keeps getting tangled up in itself for one thing. One of the hook clips has a piece of plastic melding it to itself, which looks like a manufacturer defect, and results in me not being able to attach the clip to anything. I can't figure out how to hook it up at the bottom, and the tighteners on the top and side in the picture are both right next to each other on the side on my net - huh? It also came with two plastic pieces that are mentioned nowhere in the instructions on the back of the box. I can usually figure things out, but after attempting to install this thing for an hour, I give up. I wish the instructions were clearer."
2,"great quality, not great for cats.","I bought the rider net because it is very hard for my cats to remain in their crate on my 7 hour drive back home for school. Most other backseat car products are made for large dogs, so when I saw that this didn't have large holes in it and it went from floor to ceiling I was very hopeful. The product was very easy to install in my Honda Accord and for the first hour the cats remained in the back seat with no problem. After an hour though both of them figured out how to climb over and around the net, completely defeating its purpose. The next rest stop I ended up just taking the net down. The product is well made and easy to install, but unless you have calm and non curious animals it probably won't work for your needs."
3,didn't work for us,"The quality of this item seems fine and will work for dogs that just need a visual barrier. One of our dogs always stays in the back seat, but the other likes to come up front when we are away from the car and wait for us in the driver's seat. It might work if the barrier came up to the ceiling of the car but I couldn't figure out a way to make that happen. Our dog (85 pounds) just jumped right over it. When we returned, he jumped back into the back and ended up getting his leg caught in the netting. Luckily we were there to untangle him. Since it was pretty inexpensive, we will just donate it to our Humane Society Thrift Store and hopefully somebody else can use it."
1,Very bad quality,"I just brought one from a internet store and I have to return it on my own cost. It's a brane new product. However, the quality is realy bad. The one way transmission is broken at all, which you cannot hear anything but noise. The another way transmission is sort of working but very noisy as well. I doubt if Motorola realy test the product before putting them on the shelf.If you still consider buying it, I'd suggest you try it from the local store first. Otherwise, you may have to pay the shipping fee to return it.I would give a 0 if there is 0 rating."
3,It's alright,"It doesnt stay in place when u makes turns & bumps so it's kinda annoying, but sometimes there is no problems"
2,First impression -- not good,Just received the book and tried the Lasagna recipe which is the biggest disaster I've ever seen in a cookbook. The recipe is all wrong (2 1/4 cups flour in a quart of bechamel sauce! ) Other recipes look good (Osso Buco and risotto). Just avoid that Lasagna recipe!
2,Little Too Small,This was a little smaller than I anticipated and my larger dog destroyed it within minutes. It wasn't as well made as some other toys.
3,Still no match...,"I have yet to find a toy that will give my 55lb lab a run for the money. The stuffing was removed in about 20 mins or so. The rest of the body is still intact. This toy is cheap enough that I don't really care too much that it was destroyed so quickly. He can kill other much more expensive toys in the same amount of time, so I don't mind. He loves all the toys he receives. Of course my other dog has nothing but destroyed toys to play with. LolBottom line:spend a few dollars and let your pup have some fun.If you found my review useful, pls vote ""yes"""
2,"Good price, but won't last long","I bought this just because it was cheap with free shipping. I did not expect it to last very long with my 70lbs puppy. Usually his stuffed toys will last a few days until he performs a lobotomy on it and removes the brains and squeaker. This toy, however, lasted less than 5 minutes. I'm not sure why this one got destroyed so much fast. I'd give it 1-star if the price werent so amazing, but considering I spent 4$ on this thing, I'm not too bothered by it. But, I would not recommend for strong chewers or for larger dogs. I'm going to be sticking to kong products from now on."
2,Piece of crap,"Lasted about an hour until all the fur came off the thing just from the dogs tossing it around.I think I only paid a couple bucks for it, but the cleanup wasn't worth the bargain.It was in the trash after day 1."
2,Squeaker only lasted one day,"My Pocket Shih Tzu loved playing with this toy, but the squeaker died after (literally) one day of playing. I would not order this again."
3,Lasted 1 hour but worth every penny!,"I bought this dog toy while shopping on Amazon @ 30,000 feet on a Delta flight (way cool!). When I got back from my business trip I found that the octopus had lost his battle with my Yorkie Ginger. My wife said that Ginger just hated the thing :) She was ripping at it until there was stuffing pieces throughout the house (1 hour). My wife then placed the octopus on top of the refrigerator where Ginger could not see the ""enemy"". That lasted all of two minutes till Ginger used her snout to find the whereabouts of the missing 8 legged enemy. At this point it was time for the Octopus to leave the house, via the trash. Ginger did not want to see her enemy go without total inhalation so she decided to knock over the trash and release her vengeance. Needless to say my wife was not happy about the mess but we both enjoyed story and watching our pup have some fun as well!"
2,Chewed right threw,My 10lb malti-poo chewed threw this toy in 3 days. Not a well made plush toy.I would not recommend. Other Kyjen products alot better quality.
2,Fun but not durable,This toy instantly became one of my Bichon's favorites. He's about 9 weeks old. He hasn't been able to tear apart any of his other toys so I was surprised when he managed to tear this one apart in less than 48 hours. I will be buying another octopus dog toy but hopefully a more durable brand.
3,destroyed in about an hour,"I agree with a previous review stating this was destroyed within an hour. I just received this last night. Our 4lb dog, Piper, LOVES toys and goes through them pretty regularly. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money knowing she loves to tear them up. Upon seeing the 'new toy', Piper couldn't wait for us to let her have it. After about 15 min, she had already broken a hole in the side. (I wasn't surprised, lol.) About an hour after giving it to her, there was stuffing ALL OVER the living room and the poor squeaker was in peices. (who knew a 4lb dog could be so destructive? Good thing she only tears up toys and nothing else!) I just let her finish as that I'm sure was half the fun. After throwing all the stuffing away, she is still running after this toy; so not all is lost. Good price, not so great quality, but it still served it's purpose. It kept our Piper entertained all evening!"
3,Cute but easily destroyed,My dogs destroyed this toy in about an hour. I removed the stuffing though and they still play with it so it was not a wate of money. This toy is for a small dog/puppy. Cute toy for a small dog
2,Not for play...poor quality :(,"I bought this for my 3 month old puppy, who is 6 pounds. It lasted a week before the poor little guy started falling appart, exposing the threads and stuffing. NOT SAFE TO BE PLAYED WITH UNSUPPERVISED. Your puppy/ dog will choke on the stuffing & can even get to & eat the squeaker! she absolutely adored this toy but it fell apart way too quickly & no, she wasn't tearing it up. was heartbroken after I had to take it away."
3,Not too durable,but we've had worse. She's a chewer and though it got a couple small holes in it on Day 1 it's still around - we haven't thrown it out for oozing stuffing... yet!
5,The dogs love this toy!,"I bought two of these toys for my two dogs, and they love them! Such a fun toy. Would definitely buy again."
3,"Very Cute Toy, Not durable though","We gave this toy as a gift to my sister's dog and he loved it immediately! It is such a cute toy and very soft. But the very next day, my sister told me he managed to pull off 2 of the legs. I was surprised since this company also makes the ""Egg Baby' toys and through the years our dogs have put those to the test but the toy still looks great. Unfortunately not this one. Cute toy, soft, squeaky but not built to last!!"
3,my dog tore it up fast,It was a alright toy for the price my dog liked it she tore it up in two days ow well
5,Octopus plush toy,Too bad the doxy loved it more! It is now a nono-pus. No arms at all. Is there a toy that is impervious to a daschund?
4,SO CUTE,"SOO MANY DOGGIES WILL BE HAPPY TO GET THIS AS A GIFT,,,FUN TO PLAY WITH N HRS OF ENTERTAINMENT,,,,THEY WARE HAPPY"
3,Cute but not very sturdy,"This is a very cute toy and kept my puppy entertained for a few days. Until he ripped it apart. My 6 month old puppy tore this cute little toy apart in a matter of days. So if you have a dog that likes to chew, this toy is not for you."
3,eh ... kinda small,Sure my dog loved it ... he also loves an empty plastic water bottle. I was just expecting it to be a bit larger.
3,C,"super cute and arrived as expected, however only lasted about 5 min. I purchased this for a 4 month old boxer."
2,This Is Not the Recitation of Desiderata That Inspired Me,"Les Crane's performance of Desiderata, with high-pitched female gospel-like backup and 70's quality electronic music is not the recording that inspired me during my teenage years. (That was a few decades ago.) Two tracks on the Les Crane CD are okay, ""Nature-Wilderness"" and ""Love-Children Learn What They Live"". The other tracks are overdone.Updated on 2010-09-25It took years of searching, but I finally found it. The recording I would heard late at night when the radio station was signing off the air is by Dave Allen, an Irish comedian. The recording is on a 45 RPM. The title is ""A Way of Life"". The other side, which I'd forgotten about, is titled ""The Good Earth"". Both are inspirational.[...]Updated on 2010-10-26And, for those who care about who was first, Mr. Allen's 45 RPM was released in 1969 according the YouTube post."
3,NOT THE ORIGINAL,"I was 12 years old when I heard the beautiful Go Placidly. (about 1970.) I ordered the Les Crane version thru Amazon, and while it is still inspiring, it is NOT the original recording. The original speaker had a more powerful, and more inspiring, and deeper voice. (and like this powerful poem from my childhood, a voice I will never forget). An earlier commentator mentioned the original voice belonged to Davison. Unfortunately, I cannot find a copy anywhere. Any ideas?"
5,Desiderata is a beautiful piece,"I finally found it. After buying several versions of the piece Desiderata, I finally found the version that my dad used to play when I was young. It had a real effect on my life. Les Crane reads the original Desiderata composition, written by Max Ehrmann, while beautiful music plays in the background. The following is the chorus that is sung at various times throughout the piece. ""You are a child of the universe...no less than the trees and the stars...you have a right to be here...and where or not it is clear to you...no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should"" This a great piece...I highly recommend it."
3,Not for beginners,"If you didn't see the list of topics this book covers, then I suggest reading it before continuing on with the purchase. This book is not for beginners. It's a jump into the deep end of C#, with only a brief look at the basic differences/advantages of C# over Java and C++.Class-based programming is nothing new. However, class-based component orientation programming is a more robust, extensible concept. My favorite aspect of C# is the near-elimination of pointers, and the headache they bring along in C++.The book is full of syntax help, which is invaluable for anyone attempting to branch out from C++ into new programs in C#, or possibly even for the advanced.It's deep, and this book will serve those already familiar with object oriented programming much better."
5,"The thicker, the better? Not!","I find this book very useful. It is a thin book for a technical book, but what's good about being thick when there are too much unnecessary information is in the book?This book is thin and to the point. It may not standout in your bookshelf, but it surely does the job of being a reference book."
3,A more mature Malaria!?,"This was quite different from their earlier undertakings. Being that it has a very laid back, almost soothing sound for most of the tracks. Not that this is an easy listening type album, I thought 'Phophet and Keep me in love', ROCKED. However...theirprevious efforts are more engaging and artistic.I did turn a buddy on to this album and he thought that it was the BEST they ever did. He plays it nonstop...so what do I know...LoL!"
5,Learned from Steinbeck and then outdid the master.,Kevin McIlvoy must have studied at John Steinbeck's feet and then surpassed his teacher. The common man and his humanity made glorious. My heart grew.
4,Good,"They were smaller than I expected as I guess I'm used to the jumbo ones that are sold individually. We have been enjoying them. I'm not sure if they gave us mostly the yellow/orange ones or my child ate most of the red/blue ones while I wasn't looking. Will buy again when I run out, which wont be too long."
4,Works great,"Simple to use and good construction. Nothing fancy, just a timing light that does its job.First use was in full daylight and it was easy to read the timing marks. I am happy with the purchase."
3,good product,"At first i was cynical about the timing light but when i got it and connect it to my truck then i was a little impress, all in all it did the job."
2,Timing light OK,"Got to be carefull how I word this, or it won't be posted. Has to be cleared first? It took a very long time for this to arrive, I think because it was sold by A*****.LLC. Emphasis on the LLCpart. Very disappointing since it was supposed to be in stock."
4,Easy-to-use item,"The item seems to be made from good-quality plastic, you feel that it will last long if properly used.It was great that the light part was flat, this really makes it comfortable to get close to timing marks on my 94 toyota camry, without touching the belts.The space there is really narrow.It works perfectly so far, and the only reason I didn't give 5-stars to it, is that there was ~5mm-length ""mate"" line on the lens, going through the center!And I noticed it when the item was still in package (it comes within transparent plastic package).First I thought it's a dirt, but once opened the package I noticed that this is a defect on lens.Anyway, it is not a microscope so it's not so important issue, it works fine for me and the light is being seen well on shiny summer lunch-time :)"
3,The Mounted Joust,excellent product. Has many references and descriptions of tools used in the art of the tournament.
5,"Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch is always a good read.","This is one of our favorite books to read aloud. I bought one for each one of my daughters, and a couple more for friends. The seller was first rate."
3,*yawn*,"This is not the best book I've ever read, and I may donate it to the school.The rancher goes to his ""sleepy"" town for excitement - and wow, what an exciting day he has! Why, there's a checker game that just made a king, and it only took two weeks! The whole town turned out to see a turtle cross the road!Meanwhile, his wife ""misses everything"" because she's stuck at home while more and more farm animals give birth and boring stuff like lottery tickets and oil wells happen. Shucks.There's not much to it, but it is pretty funny the first few times. I think it'll get more use in a classroom than in a fairly small family, though."
5,love it!,Fun book for adults & kinds. Teaches kids the experience between fast & slow--if read out loud well. Just a darn cute imaginative book.
4,Completely Wacky Fun!,"I've read this book to my son over and over and he just loves it. Although the story is one of those rather slim two dimensional narratives, the wonderful illustrations make up for a lot and keep everyone amply amused. We love the contrast of the two different 'worlds'; the speed at which everything happens back at the farm versus in town. Hysterical stuff!"
5,A Deadly Exchange = and exciting adventure,"Sheryl Stafford, the author, has done an exeptional job of writing a fast-paced, action-packed book. Once you start reading you won't want to put this page-turner down--and yearn for more upon its completion. This pleasure read would lend itself to a fabulously, exciting movie. I hope Stafford is already writing a sequel and this book achieves the notariety it deserves. So if you enjoy reading abnout thrilling adventures that take place in the tropical islands you will enjoy this book immensely."
4,"A Deadly Exchange, great reading.","Please don't read this book before going to bed hoping to be lulled into sleep, because you will still be up at dawn turning the pages. This is a fast read, I couldn't put it down. What seems like an idyllic sail to the Bahamas turns into Matt and Alex's worst nightmare and we are instantly caught up in it. A drug deal gone wrong, sadistic drug lords, fishy Federal agents, foul weather and a plucky heroine all conspire to make this an exciting novel. Hoping for more from Sheryl Jane Stafford."
5,no time to quit,"Well written because of inside information, she lives with a Vitnam vet.She knew what to do to survive,survival came back to haunt him. When push came to shove he did the shoveing. You live and breathe danger with each word that Sheryl writes. Being a former Army/Navy diver I don't read popcorn thrillers. You have to excite and keep me excited .Sheryl has been on the high seas so she can feel and make you taste the salt clean air. This is the work of A true salior,if you need a high then this is for you.can't wait to see what she will write next."
5,My kinda book,Couldn't put it down.This is the best book I've read in years.Sheryl puts raw emotion into play.I felt like I was there.I can't say enough about this book.I'm waiting for her next one.Robin Graysmith
2,Not good for noisy gym!,"These phones sound good, but not good for noisy gym. They are not isolating headphones, and I found theneckband uncomfortable when working out. I found MME ear monitors better, the screw into your ears typemuch better. My gym blasts music from the ceiling speakers - the MME's block much of it, but like a lotof earphones, you have to experiment and try different ones."
2,Disappointed. One-size-fits-some?,"I bought these headphones to replace my current in-ear style. Going on my previous experience with theSennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging CradleI'd bought previously, and the rating this model received, I figured I had a winner. Boy, was I wrong.The PMX60s cannot be adjusted short of heating and re-shaping the neckband, and they have a tendency to slip off at the slightest movement. The poor fit also leads to the front of the speakers not sitting on my ears fully, letting outside sounds in. The speakers seem underpowered and tinny, even after adjusting the EQ settings on my mp3 player. I was going to give it a couple days, to see if they could be ""broken in"", but gave up after one day and returned them.Not recommended."
2,not durable,"I have it since almost a year now, and I use it all the time, but the neck band is kind of tricky weak, I am always in a fear that it might break. Right ear sounds lower than the left ear, should have been more durable. looks good as new but needs too much care"
4,Great Price with Excellent Quality,"THe Sound Quality is WAY better with the Sony Earphones I used previously, I am really glad that I gave it a shot and such a delightful surprise."
3,Light in weight and bass,"Bought these as a replacement to similar Sony phones, which I found uncomfortable on long runs. They have incredibly clear sound in the mids through highs, great for classical music, though that isn't what one typically listens to while working out. Despite the assurances of other reviewers to the contrary, these headphones do, in fact reproduce bass quite badly and they WILL distort at moderate volumes in the 100-800 Hz range. On an album like Speakerboxxx, the drivers give off a sound like a leafblower instead of thumping with the bass. Sennheiser has clearly sacrificed the potency of the driver to reduce mass. They are very comfortable for this style of phone."
2,VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH SENNHEISER,"Sadly I got to tell that I am very dissapointed with this PMX60 headset. The sound quality is very good but the durability is poor. I bought this on april 2009 and 28 months later the neckband brokes with apparent no reason. I am a very light user, (never use this for excersice or jogging), and maybe I have used this for only 30 or 40 times, (less than 2 hours each time), in the whole 28 months. BAD SENNHEISER... BAD..."
2,I've had better,I was really disappointed with these. Considering they originally cost 50 bucks I thought they would sound better than my Sony headphones that came in a similar style.(mdr-g42) I was wrong. They sound crisp but have no bottom end. Very weak. They also distort at high volume. I'm sticking with Sony brand from now on.
4,"Short, short cord","These headphones are great in every way but one - the cord is waaaay too short! OMG, would it be so much to add another foot?!"
4,The best,"These are the best headphones for the price. Having top notch sound quality and comfort. The only issue is that the neckband is a little weak, but for people who aren't like me and break headphones like wishbones, these are perfect."
5,Great set of behind-the-neck headphones,"I have been using these headphones for about a year now and I absolutely love them. I have owned a pair of Bose on-ear headphones, and I know these don't quite compare in overall sound, they win in comfort and size. The only con these headphones have is the same fault that any Behind-The-Neck headphones have... if you have a coat or a shirt with a collar, the headphones can get pushed around a bit. I have passed many headphones down to my sons, but these I just won't give up. I may have to buy a 2nd pair and see how much they can hold up to a teenager's abuse."
3,Eh,"These are far from the best headphones I've ever owned. They look nice and they feel very comfortable. The noise bleeding doesn't really bother me, but I suppose closed headphones would be better for riding the noisy NYC subways as I tend to do, but these are ok. The problem I have is, and I should have listened to other reviews, is that the bass on these headphones is extremely underwhelming. I've gotten better bass out of crappy $15 Phillips headphones. Overall I don't think these were worth the money I spent on them and if they broke I would get a different pair with better bass."
3,Decent but not great,"these are decent sounding headphones made by a good company. the sound is overall good but lacks bass. these are lower end sennheiser's, entry level really. if you can find these for 20.00 or less i'd say they are worth it. i would look into sennheiser pmx100's if you want a quality behind the neck headphone."
5,Sounds great.,I needed something for the gym and it worked to what I was looking for. I really enjoy the quality of the sound that it has. I know that Sennheiser make great products so I knew that they weren't going to leave any thing out in the consumer head phone.
4,"Great Sound, Excellent Value","I bought these headphones to replace another behind the neck pair from Sony, which I thought I had lost. The Sony headphones had a more comfortable fit, but the sound quality of the Sennhesier's is so superior that even after discovering that I had only misplaced the Sony's. I'm still using the Sennheiser's three times a week when I run. Great sound at all frequencies, with night tight bass. The headphones fit securely and are perfectly comfortable, just not quite as good as the Sony's. For the price, though, they can't be beat."
2,Only lasted about 2 months,"I heard good things about this brand but I was really disappointed with these. They stretched out really quickly so they wouldn't fit on my head very well. Then, after less than 2 months of use, the bass is totally shot. It's crackly and pretty much ruined. The $10 headphones I got at Radio Shack lasted a LOT longer than these. If you're looking for a good set of durable headphones, keep looking."
4,Great headphones for the money,"I bought these for working out and other activities. I tried other phones from local retailers but for about the same price, these are much superior in terms of sound quality. I also bought a pair of PMX100 which have even better sound than these, but the PMX60 seem a bit more rugged and sound fine. I plan to buy a couple more pair of these for kids."
4,Sound great .. slightly annoying for eyeglass wearers,"These headphones sound great. But, I wear glasses, and the over-the-ear loop part is slightly annoying, because it rubs against frame of the glasses. I end up putting the headphones under the glasses stem, and then it's not so bad."
4,great price-sometimes too loud,"I bought these because I don't like something sticking in my ears. For that, these are great. You don't even realize they are there. The sound quality is one of the best I've ever experienced. But they can get loud! These are open headphones, and even I turn my Mac waaay down, there is some (very little) leakage. But if you turn in midway, then people can sing along to whatever you're listening.Anyways, I love these headphones, definitely would by them again."
3,"O.K., but not as good as the MX-500 earbuds","After reading some of the good press that the PMX-60's received at the time of their release, I decided to try them. A/B-ed against the Sennheiser MX-500 earbuds, the PMX-60's, to me, were a disappointment. In my judgment, the MX-500's better the PMX-60's in just about every category: price, comfort, sound quality, aesthetics. The MX-500's have a much more open, clear and detailed sound--and better bass--than the PMX-60's; in short the MX-500's are much more involving as well as more affordable. I'll continue to do a bit more A/B-ing, but the verdict is already in: Save $10 and buy the MX-500 earbuds instead of the PMX-60's!"
5,very low profile headphones great under helmets,"These are typical great Sennheiser quality and they fit perfectly under a snowboarding helmet. The only thing you could possibly ask for would be a volume control in the cord, but you can buy plug-in in-line volume controls (which get desroyed after a season or two anyway so probably better this way anyway..."
4,Good but noisy,"Incredible sound quality- however, it has very little outward noise canceling, so everyone around you will be able to hear your music rather clearly if you're playing it on the iPod's maximum volume.However, this means that it can double as a speaker, which is a plus!"
1,Broken in 8 weeks,"I bought this headset for my daughter at Christmas. They sounded great and she loved them, but after about 8 weeks of use she quit using them. She showed me that the speaker part pulled out of the band.After examining them I see that it is all plastic and the wire rides in a little grove on the inner side of the band. When the speaker part pops out the wire become the support and the whole thing just dangles around your neck.I was very disappointed with the workmanship of this product and would not recommend them."
3,Not very durable,"I purchased this in July 2011 as the PMX 60ii(No longer offered on Amazon) but packed inside was only the PMX 60.While the sound is extremely good, the neck band on mine also broke for no apparent reason after only 4 months.I've had cheap behind the neck headphones in the past that have lasted me for years. 8 or 9 years for some unknown name......And they are still in good shape in that regard.Why can't Sennheiser produce a stronger headphone? That I just cannot understand."
3,They work good,Problem is that they don't fit ones head tight enough to hear your music without hearing external noise. They need some way of tightening because exercising or walking with them will cause them to move.
3,Good but not Spectacular,"I rollerblade with my Creative Nomad Zen MP3 player and I had been using some behind the head Phillips headphones that I really love. I got these to replace those and they are equal in sound quality. These are much more comfortable and just tight enough so that they don't let the wind rush in when I rollerblade.-very comfortable-crisp sound quality-bass isn't anything special, I could use more-wind doesn't rush in when I rollerblade, but they don't crush my head and ears either"
3,LEAKAGE!,"I purchased these headphones for $13.69 (excluding shipping), and I will be returning them asap.Pros:-nice fit-good sound-very nice design/styleCons:-SOUND LEAKAGE! Like, I couldn't believe how much the sound leaked out of these at a moderate volume level. I highly dislike that. I've never owned a pair that leaked so much; this is why I will be returning them asap.I would not recommend these if you're going to be around people."
3,"Leaks a lot of sound, not adjustable",OK -- so the sound is great for the price. I don't dispute that.You should be aware that the headphones aren't adjustable AT ALL. Sennheiser: Get a clue. One size doesn't fit all in this world.The cord is short. With most portable audio equipment this isn't a big deal. Be careful if you got these for work.They leak sound like they're cranked up and pointed at somebody -- even if they're not actually cranked up and pointed at somebody. At pretty much any decent volume setting somebody next to you (or in the next cube!) can hear what you're listening to. If you have privacy (or annoyance) concerns -- these aren't the headphones for you.
4,Nice product,"Well, I just got the headphones today and they are working out great. I know that a few other reviewers have complained about a very short cord length. However, I find that the length is just fine. It is enough to go from my head to my waist (i'm 5'11""), while still giving some slack. They are very comfortable on my ears and on the back of my neck.However, just as others have mentioned, these headphones can DEFINITELY be heard by people around you. If this is a problem for you, then I wouldn't buy these. But, if you think this won't be a real issue, then they are a great set of headphones and sound great!"
4,Just what I was looking for.,"I had been searching for a behind the ear headphone to connect to my ipod while I was washing the car or doing yard work. I wanted something with relatively good sound and didn't cost more than $25.00. The ipod's in-the-ear headphones were uncomfortable and fell out too easily. I also tried lightweight over-the-head headphones, but they too were uncomfortable and fell off too easily. The Sennheiser headphones fit me comfortably, stayed on my head, and sounded better than the price I paid for it. For me, it a great find and just what I was looking for."
3,just ok,"I had sony mdr g52 for years and after seeing the reviews on these, thought, i will give them a try.If YOU want a deeper richer bass sound, stick with the Sony's. These have a very crisp sound, in fact so muchcrisp treble, you can hear a treble highs that are annoying and there is no way to enhance or add a bass sound to the headphones. I thought i was being too picky and did a comparison test with my old ones with the family. They agreed, the sony's were smoother and richer bass. Headphones bottom line are good and worth the money, but there are some smoother better sounding out there."
4,"a bit uncomfortable, not enough bass","These hurt my ears after 30-40 minutes of just sitting at Starbucks. Bass is pretty unnoticeable. However, the headphones (as is pointed out in other reviews) sure are louder than others, which is a plus in a coffee shop."
5,Sound good and stay in place,I'm on my third set of PMX60's. They sound great but the main reason I buy them is they stay in place no matter what you are doing. Working in the yard or going to the track is no problem. I'm on my third set because I abuse the the cord. Once I broke the wire by getting caught on a door handle. I cut the cord with a saw on my last set which were only 3 months old. My fault.
4,Nice comfortable 'phones,"These seem to be a variant of the PMX-100 headphones but with the around the neck design. I wanted a light and largely open air for around town, shopping and such. They do let others hear a bit but there just a nice general use pair of headphones which I use with my iPod. They are what they are and do it quite nicely - the sound is pleasing with clear highs and decent lows. They are not closed or in ear types, nor are they high end but hey for 90% of iPod use they're great and I definitely recommend them."
2,Not worth the money,Unfortunately these headphones were just not what I was hoping for. They seem to not fit right on my ears and allow a great deal of ambient noise in which in turn causes me to have to turn up my music to compensate for it. The sound quality is just OK. I will probably end up giving this set to my kids and finding another set for work.
2,Hope your head is huge!,"These ear phones have no adjustment options, so unless your head is quite large, these will be uncomfortably loose fitting and distracting should you move your head."
3,"Great sound, cheap cable",Been through three pairs of these with the cable messing up every time. Definitely not up to cycling long-term.
1,Not what I was hoping...,"The unit looked decent on my head (or so my wife says) and that is where the good review ends. The headphones did not seem to fit properly on my ears. I have a 7 1/4 hat size, not really big and not really small. The sound was heavy on ""tin"" and light on ""boom"". They actually sounded scratchy and distorted even on low volume. I had purchased a pair of Sony MDR-G57G sports model headphones for my wife a few weeks ago and they look, feel and sound great for about the same money. My suggestion is to get something different. Rod"
2,They're okay.,"The sound is too airy, and lacking on bass. They also make cymbals sound horrible, maybe a little bit tinny?Sure, they look cool, but you can find better sound for a lower price.I also own a pair of Sony MDR-Q22LP's and they sound much better, and cost less. The cord is also longer on the Sonys and they also fit better. My head is a bit small, and the PMX60s are always sliding down..Totally NOT recommended for exercising in. If you want something to exercise in, get the Koss Sporta/PortaPros. Much better sound quality, and have a better fit.If you're willing to go $10 more, the Senn PX100's are also much better.These are getting 2 stars because the cord is very thick and they look cool. The sound is mediocre."
2,"Good sound quality, but HORRIBLE build quality.","I've purchased this item numerous amounts of times because of the superb sound quality. Unfortunately after owning my 3rd set I can no longer recommend this product to anyone. These headphones sound GREAT, and since I love loud music these were perfect. They bleed ALOT of sound, as in people can hear if you crank it up. But after breaking my 3rd set I can't stand it anymore. Nothing provoked it this time to stop working. The left ear started scratching a bit, then it completely died. And it's not my iPod's fault. So while it's a very good pair of headphones, it really doesn't last long at all."
2,No good for exercise,These ear phones won't fit in your ear if you plan to exercise. They also kept falling out of my mp3 player. I stopped using them altogether. They make work well if you're not planning to use them during a workout.
5,I can't believe what I'm hearing,"For $25 you really can't go wrong here. I just got my pair earlier today and I couldn't be more happy. These headphones are really, really light and comfortable. The sound is unbelievably good. The cord is a little short as others have said, but I'm using these headphones with a new 40GB iPod, so they're fine for what I need 'em for.People can definitely hear your music if it's loud enough and your location is quiet enough. In a louder environment you'd be fine, but if you want these headphones for use at the gym or something like that then you may be in a bit of a quandry.All in all, this product is excellent and unbelievable for the price. If you're looking for affordable headphones to use in conjuction with a portable music source I doubt you'd find a better pair than these."
2,Not worth the money,"I cannot get used to the on-top-of-the-head style so this around the neck is very important to me and what I'll be comparing it to.Not nearly as good sound quality as the Polk Audio Ultrafit 2000 which cost about the same.I have a small head and the fit is fine. The earphones fit right on my ear.The sound quality reminds me of the Creative headphones that used to retail for about $15 (and now sadly discontinued).If you're going to spend 65 bones on a pair of headphones that are going to get really sweaty, spend it on the Polk Audio version. Or tell Creative to bring back theirs which looked remarkably similar and had the same audio performance and fit."
3,Reasonable Quality Budget Headphones,Sound quality is acceptable. It's clear but the bass response is limited.Comfort is very good. My ears are sensitive to the pressure from headphones. I can wear these for over an hour with no discomfort.Since they're the open ear type they're not the ideal choice for wearing on public transportation or in elevators.
1,Waste of money,"Don't believe the good reviews! These headsets are awful!!!!! There is no way to adjust the fit, and it would be a miracle if they fit you correctly. Absolutely the worst headsets I have ever owned, no reduction in background noise, I wore them one time on the subway and threw them out when I got home. I couldn't hear the music on my iPod because of all the background noise. No matter how much you turn up the volume they cannot compete with the ambient sound around you.Don't waste your money and time and cheap out on these. Suck it up and spend a few more bucks and get a good set of earbuds like the ER6i."
1,Cord isn't 6 feet long.,"The product description says the cord is 6 feet, but it's really only just over 3 feet long."
2,bad information!!,"I was VERY disappointed with these headphones. Don't get me wrong, they work just fine and the sound quality is just great. My disappointment is in the advertising on Amazon.com. It plainly says that the headphone cord is 6 feet long - which is exactly why I bought these. I wanted headphones that I could wear at work (plugged into my speakers) and still move around a little at my desk. The cord ACTUALLY measures less than 3.5 feet - shorter than the headphones I was trying to replace. I would have bought headphones that were twice the price to find a set that would have had the length. I'm very, very disappointed in Amazon (or whomever is responsible for the advertising)."
2,kind of a waste of money,"they were kind of a waste of my money to me. the sound is too poor of quality for thirty. the treble was good but no bass. if you want good sound quality get earbuds they are the best especially the MDR-EX51LP and the E2C. if your buying these for running id get the sony brand they are cheaper and are the same sound quality but if you want good sound quality for running get clip earbuds. earbuds are probably better becauseallthe sound goes into your ear and none of it is lost. clip, behind the neck, and lightweight headphones arent good because the sound goes into the air. so yeah like i said i would get earbuds, clip earbuds, or the big studio headphones with the ear cushions, the sound isnt lost. if your low on money though and want to spend less than twenty or maybe even ten try MDR-E828LP and HA-X570 and MDR-J10 for good sound under twenty."
1,Don't wast e your money!!,"I read a few reviews on here about this headphone and the few that wrote the bad side about this headphne was true. If you like for everyone to listen to your music w/ them on then get them, I don't. Yes they r very light and feel good around the ears but thats about it. I perfer Sony's and that's what I am going to stick with, for the money u pay for so call good quality isn't all that is expect it to be. Do your reseach before u jump for style I perfer good sound quality. The sound quality is poor to me very loud and no deep inner bass. Hope this help everyone."
3,"Looks good, but doesn't sound good","I have tried PMX 40 and PMX 100, this headphone doesn't even compare, though the construction is quite good but the bass quality is so poor. Surprising if your are to compare the sound quality with other over the ear headphones of Senn. You might as well as consider Koss KSC75 is way cheaper and sounds better, that if you don't mind clipping something on flaps of your ears. Actually, I want to return this item, that if I had the chance."
3,Headphones had the correct cord length,I was looking for a shorter cord so that I could use them when running and exercising. The cord length was fine. The quality of the sound is OK but not great. The plug seems to short out once in a while but it is OK.
2,poor fitting,This product is not sized for small heads. It is too loose and there is one place on the skull where it puts pressure behind the ears that gets uncomfortable.
2,not good enough,"The Sennheiser PMX60 headphones do not fit well, so how can you tell what the sound quality is? It's my first Sennheiser purchase, but I can't view any difference in the pictures. I wanted a snug, well-fitting, light-weight neckband design that delivered great sound quality. Can someone help me with this? These slip, fall, do not stay where needed.Also, an in-line volume control is a great added feature."
5,Great headphones.,"I have been a fan of Sennheiser for over 25 years. The PMX60 is very lightweight and comfortable, but what prompted me to get this pair was that my son commandeered my other set because he liked them so much.The bass is rich, full and distortion free. The PMX60 can handle gut-churning lows that have made other headphones (and some speakers) distort to the point of sounding like farts. (I recommends the opening bass notes of ""Mirror in the Bathroom"" by The English Beat on the ""Dance Craze"" soundtrack as a test. Many higher priced headphones have failed this test.) Also, the highs are crisp and clear."
2,Too Much Hype For An Average Item,"I bought these to replace a very identical neck-wrap around pair made by Sony. Bad decision. Yes, the highs or treble is extremely audible, but that is all you get. The bass compared to the Sony is weak. I think it is caused because the design of the neck band, though comfortable, allows the bottom sound to leak out thus resulting in only midranges and highs. Way too overpriced. The sound of these equals a $10 set. Very diappointed. I thought these would be an improvement over my Sony's which just needed replacement foam headphone covers, but they are not. I guess I learned my lesson. I'm going back to my Sony's and replacing the covers."
5,Sennheiser PMX60 Review,These headphones sound better than some more expensive ones I have. Don't know how they do it for the price.
5,Dandy product,"These are great. Nice sound, comfortable (even with glasses)... easy to live with. I dig 'em."
4,"Practical, doable tips","A straightforward how-to-do-it little book (about 50 8 1/2 by 11 inch pages) that, though published in 1981, still is relevant."
4,The 1 to buy,"If you're going to buy just one of the Tori Amos sheet books, this is definently the one you are looking for. All Tori singles from ""Little Earthquakes"" to ""From the choirgirl Hotel"".I'm not a good piano player, so actually I'm not able to play any of the songs -yet. The closest I can get is ""china"".One of my friends, however is a great Piano player so I can tell that some of the songs are simplified, for example Cornflake Girl; but that is very understandable...no one can play the piano like Tori. The interpretions however are very good and I would definently recommend it; both if you are a great piano player or just interested in music."
1,Very POOR Quality,"I have a hard time buying things online because I am a very visual person! This item was very poor quality. I wore it 3 times and washed it 4 times and the threads were so thin in places you could see through it. I was also 2x bigger than a normal sized medium. I do not recomend this Company ""Hice"""
2,Disappointing,"Material is paper thin. Colors are not near as vibrant as in picture. Very disappointing, but also very cheap. Good example of you get what you pay for."
1,"Promising start, ending in massive snore","I have loved Freya North's novels since stumbling across one in a secondhand bookshop a few years ago. Usually lighthearted, moving and entertaining, Sally has left me perplexed and slightly bored. It opens with an astonishingly raunchy sex scene which could bode well for the rest of the book. Sally doesn't want the chap to fall in love with her, but he does, and she basically goes nuts and runs off. What is perplexing is that it's never really clear why........I ended up skipping a great chunk of fairly snore-worthy stuff where she runs off to an elderly aunt in Mull (riveting - not) and going to the end to confirm that yes, they did end up together. There's a sort of vague reference to someone who broke her nose in the past, but she'd moved on from that......honestly, a massive disappointment. Read Cat, Pip and Fen again rather than wasting your money on this."
4,Good,"Celibidache Bruckner playing is unique, this album represents the last good recordings Romanian director, of course live recording, Celibidache was contrary to the recording studios"
2,Not for the long time fan,"After listening to some of the ""original"" recordings such as Greatest Hits and Back Home Again, I listened to this and felt realyl deflated. the technical quality is there and the singing is not as inspired as we all know it so often was. I agree wih the earlier reviewer who suggested making one's own CD."
3,Not his best recordings,"I have performed his music since I was 12 years old. (over 25 years ago). I know his music quite well and was looking for a good collection since most of mine were on Vinyl. These are not his originally released works. The digital remastering is actually of poor quality in my opinion. It is a great collection but if you are looking for original commercially released versions, this is not the CD to buy."
5,Great Interventions,This book is very good at breaking down the most basic of interventions that some times get overlooked. The interventions listed make you critically think about how they can be used and where else and which sub topic you may find the specific nursing diagnosis needed for a specific care plan.
5,So good it will make you cells splater,"by far my favorite david torn album instead of splattercell's oh.Draws a lot of simulatities from splattercell with cut up and proccesed drums with lavish and un paralel guitar and guitar like effects. This man playes like no other with either a fusion blues esk approach or a crazy electric fusion better than vai, and satriani together. He simply states in the liner notes that any sound that sounds like a keyboard is actually a guitar.If you have the chance to pick up this out of print gem its worth exporting, more than any other torn but their all really good but door x or (door sucks)."
1,THROW THIS ALBUM IN THE GARBAGE CAN,"This album is terrible. Do not buy it. It is the most pathetic record i have ever heard. I wonder how record labels can put out such garbage as this...hense, the name of the band."
3,A band with future......,"Having seen them live and having listend to the CD ,I find that Idiot Box has improved a lot; in fact, I believe that they are a band, which should be taken seriously. The CD itself lacks a bit of final professional production, but what can you expect for the moment: No new band can afford great production. Nevertheless, the music is nicely composed, very intelligent and really interesting. From all of those Bay Area bands that I have heard, this seems like one heading for success!"
1,Disappointing,I should have given more thought to the previous review! Talk about a big disappointment in the number of examples actually presented in this book. Very few problems have actually been solved and even these are quite too simple. I was expecting a book that would really help me prepare for the civil discipline specific portion of the EIT exam. Unfortunately this book only skims the top of major topics and does not go into any sort of detail whatsoever. The book itself is not much thicker than an average National Geographic. My suggestion would be to leave this book alone and study from reference text books.
2,INCOMPLETE!,"I was looking for a more comprehensive coverage like Michael R. Lindeburg reference manual for the topics mentioned in the civil review, especially for a person who has been out of school for sometime.More subject matter is required for the topics mentioned rather than just having some typical problems solved as it is done in the book for each topic!!"
2,janes,this book is a total disappointment omitting important information such as detailed description of variants and the numbers produced.
2,A time capsule but not much more,"In spite of the claim on the cover, this book is far from comprehensive. British, German, and US coverage is okay but other nations, including USSR, are covered in superficial detail at best.It's an interesting historical artifact but there are far better reference books out there."
1,Not worth it,"I was really disappointed in this book as I was used to the quality of their newer books. The only thing it has going for itself is nestalgia, beyond that there are many more books that are more useable."
3,A reprint of two 1947 books.,"As I purchased it, the book was really two books, in a slipcase. One is the Jane's WWII military aircraft; the other is Jane's WWII fighting ships. Both are reprints, published in the '70s of two books published just after WWII ended. Pictures are small and muddy, but this is certainly a comprehensive overview of the military hardware of the period. Of interest to the historian or the buff. I got it for about $25 and this is the price range you should look for."
3,first online shoe purchase,"this was the first time i bought shoes over the internet because my feet are usually hard to fit, but these fit great and are comfortable too."
3,Tennis shoes,"They look good. They seem a bit longer than my other Adidas of the same size and aren't too well padded but for the price, they are fine."
2,lot of synths and sequencers..,"lot of synths and sequencers..good songssort of unrecognizable, most of them thoughit;s ... INTERESTING ...prob not best intro to either bob welch, or bebopwle"
3,Ex-Fleetwood Mac member takes on Bob,"Almost 15 years after his last LP bombed, Bob Welch comes back on a much, much smaller scale. Bob Welch Looks at Bop is his musical tribute to Be-Bop, the musical revolution that took pace in the mid-forties. Welch begins with a roaring jazz number called ""Bird."" God only knows who is playing the instruments on this record, but the record as a whole sounds as if it was recorded predominately live. Some of the record though, could've used some mixing. Songs like ""Pretty Things"" are just pointless and have no substance. ""Hustler"" takes off of an old Fleetwood Mac number and sounds like he's dealing drugs in an underground sex asylum. ""I Got Rhythm"" sounds like he has rhythm, but not much else. No soul or depth, his vocals are so ordinary and doesn't stick to anything. The album as a whole can aquire attention after a few listens, but in the future, Welch should actually try and impress us on the first listen."
2,Awful,"I cannot believe how bad this CD is. He turned a Fleetwood Mac song of his (""Silver Heels"") into something sick and perverse. The rest sounds like he lost his rhythm, and his voice is hoarse, which might be due to age, but that is no excuse for a man with brilliant song writing abilities to do something as bad as this."
1,Confusion,"This book lacks the clarity of his earlier ""Constructive Living"" book. Strange that with fifteen more years to ponder his philosophy of life he actually regressed. There is something useful in this book but this author can't express it clearly. Perhaps the next generation of Constructive Living writers will be able to fill this gap."
4,Chuchito Valdes: Keys of Latin Jazz,I saw him in concert. He all but destroyed the Grand he was working with. He was excellant!
1,Sad Muffin Baker,"I have had this book for a few years now, and I have yet to find a worthwhile recipe in it. In fact I was searching Amazon for a new muffin cookbook when I saw this one so I felt like I should leave a review. The book has no pictures and I find the recipes strangely ordered. I would not suggest this book and it will be available at our next family yard sale. I feel bad about leaving a poor review because I am sure the author put a lot of work into creating it, but I would like to hsare with outhers that I do not feel like this book is a good addition to my collection."
3,US cookbook,"I found it difficult to maintain the measurements of cups and mml and I think consequently two of my attempts were not so good. I will give it another try, surely"
5,A skeptical but creepy account,"First off, this book gave me the willies. It has a lot of information on the subject especially the events that took place near the Sierra's in the late 60s early 70s, but it relates the information in a well crafted narrative with atmosphere. Good at presenting possible supernatural/extradimensional aspect of sasquatch phenomena"
5,Plenty to Ponder Here,"This is one of the best Bigfoot books I've read to date. Loaded with interesting facts & accounts of eye-to-eye contact with the woodland creatures called Bigfoot. Published in 1976 there have been many sightings since then. This book details reports of encounters with hairy giants, UFOs & other aspects of the ""psychic"" Sasquatch, along with 8 pages of photos.For the Bigfoot fan it's a great addition to your library."
1,I hate this doll!,"This doll is so ugly. I hate the clothes, makeup--EVERYTHING! I got it for my birthday, but I never liked Meygan and I am glad they replaced her with Dana. As I said I got it for my birthday I asked for a Nevra Surfari Doll , but this was the only one left ( I wonder Why) The clothes are not the best clothes I've seen so far. And the neck broke off the second day I got it. Also in the picture she has straght hair , but when I got it she had these curls that I didn't really like and I couldn't comb. So if you want a doll that you can play and brush her hair this is not the one. The only real use for this doll is for collectors and should only stay in the box untouched.............FOREVER (Or of course it will break) If you want to argue with me be my guest-write it in a further revie~~~*Michelle*~~~"
1,Near off ugly,this doll have the uglyst topp i ver see zebra something like that meygan haves always hair like orange why slumberparty too it must be red but slumberparty was funky she was pretty but wildlife safari hmm green eyes is not her best colour i think
3,alright i suppose,"I bought Meygan and i thinks shes durable and stuff but i agree with the first viewer,she is ugly. her clothes and accessories are cool but she is butt ugly, she has an awful colour of eyes and i wish i never bought her. thats my opinion anyway.."
1,NEVRA!!! ÀND FIANNA!!!!,I love these dolls they are sow diferent than the other dolls nevra and fianna are te most prettyist they are the best sow buy these 2 toys but i don't like yasmin i have here wild life safarie she is sow lame i don't have fun with here sow i throw here away goodbye ugly bratz.sow meygan is little bit too orange cloe tto white and yasmin ielll!!!! nevra is brown and have nice clothes fianna have red lipstick great!!! sow these too dolls are sow great
5,Meygan is the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Meygan is so(...) cool!I soooooo agree with jadesbiggestfan Meygan is worth a whole lot of money.I also I'm a Jade fan.I was soo(...)upset when Meygan left now I'm a happy that they got her back, but MAKE MORE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!HELLO PEOPLE, people like Meygan so why don't you make more of her!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Wild Safari Meygan,My daughter absolutely loves Meygan in the new Safari Collection. I think myself this particular Meygan is a little bit different from the Meygans in the past she comes with an animal print shirt which makes her stand out and also shes got a rocker side to an outfit with the army green skirt and chains. She wins my daughter and I's vote for this series of bratz
1,Ummmm.....eck?,"i don't mean to be mean or anything but i was really really really dissapointed with this brat, in so many wayz. i never really liked meygan really, but anyway someone gave this thing to me as a gift so i had no choice... anyways i think the clothes she came with where kinda.....ummmm.... ugly,(whats up with that vest thing????) maybe x'cept her second outfit. and her hair oh my gosh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! well it was kinda cute and curly on one side(sorta like feathered and 70's ish)...... but on the other side it was all flat and life-less, whats the deal there? then shes got these weird baby poo brown streaks in her hair, i've never seen anyones hair that color before. but anyway, to say the least, this doll is not what you want..."
1,Disappointed,"Val was great but the storyline, setting, and overall production was horrid. Senseless violence with no higher purpose.Had we been shown more internal mental conflicts of the character Val played it might have justified the grotesque killings. But as for the philosophical concepts portrayed it went into the idea of an eye for an eye as each bad cop got killed in a similar fashion of how they had tormented the hitchhiker accused of killing the police chiefs daughter. One gets a feeling the hitchhiker or traveler is justified in seeking revenge but in the end we find out he really did it. The absolutely only redeeming quality off this movie is it's eiriness."
2,garbage,3 things that made this film possible1. val kilmer ran out of money for burgers2. the world decided everyone had 90 minutes too long in life and needed to waste it3. someone had a pretty amazing idea but unfortunately delivered it to the wrong peoplei only give this two stars because of kilmer. imagine this film is the vietnam scene in forrest gump. val kilmer is gump running back into the fray rescuing every scene until he gets shot in the arse and finds bubba who dies. like the twist in the end of this film. my netflix subscription is now cancelled to avoid anymore of these debacles.
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen! Do not waste a minute watching this movie. The acting was terrible, the plot stupid, and the ending was junk. I wouldn't take 100 dollars to watch this movie if someone paid me. Horrible!"
2,Unoriginal and mediocre,"Oh, Mr. Kilmer, what's with all these mediocre movies? You used to be in the really good stuff.This movie isn't terrible. It had real potential; the problem is ""wronged man returns from the grave for vengence"" has been done before, and this movie didn't really feel like it brought anything new to the table.There were no real surprises, except the end, and that was more of a train-going-off-the-rails than a surprise-twist. I think this movie's big problem is that it revealed the crime of the 6 cops too soon, and then kept rehashing it over and over. Maybe if they'd left the why of it all until the very last minute, dropping hints now and then, but never revealing it until the final showdown, it would have been a more compelling film.-HS"
2,Meat Splatters,"""The Traveler"" starts out like a spooky paranormal mystery. Val Kilmer's Mr. Nobody is played with an understated air, creating the sense of mystery. The handsome Dylan Neal plays the lead Detective Alexander Black whose loss of a child has triggered the chain of events. John Cassini does an amazing job as Deputy Jack Hawkins who gets spooked and plays the role like a raw nerve before his demise. The husky Christopher Gauthier plays the dimwitted Desk Sgt Gulloy; one wonders how he got on the police force. Paul McGillon has a strong supporting role as Detective Jerry Pine who has his eye on Camille Sullivan as the female deputy Jane. Unfortunately, the screenplay doesn't hold up well with the film degenerating into meat splattered against a wall in what is basically a slasher film. While there are good performances, the film is not memorable. Taxi!"
5,bowwww bowwwwww,at first i looked and i thought it said no one had reviewed this but then i looked closer and saw that sixteen people already had which i guess makes me the seventeenth. i thought it was weird that no one would have written any words about it cuz it's really good and i like it. john peel reading the lil children's story is a true delight even though i can never pay attention throughout and connect the beginning to the end. try it it's difficult.
5,another pixie with a blowtorch,"You'll never hear anything remotely like this! If you want to chase a rare butterfly off the beaten path, take ""Unicorn"" past the beaded curtains, ensconce yourself in a serene dark room, put it on, and reality be damned! The eccentric Mr. Bolan, strangely fated to have carried Eddie Cochran's guitar and a magician's instructions, with nimble assistant Mr. Took, casts a deceptively light, heady spell."
5,Absolute classic of the psychedelic folk,"This album is the best that Marc Bolan ever did. Wonderful tunes, such ""Chariots of Silk"", ""The Seal of Seasons"" and the best song about betrayal ever written, ""Iscariot"", make this record essential. Buy it, now!!!"
1,How the hell did they get a record deal?,"I know some people would base that on image, but its been done so many times before ever since that dumbf**k Pisstina Auguilera appeared. But this makes Christina look like Janis Jopplin. This is so Godawful I would take even Feminem over this (note that Feminem is #1 on my list of people who I want to die). I heard the song ""Don't Cha"" while flipping through the channels trying to get to Comedy Central (the only good basic cable channel) and I felt like sticking my head in a bear trap. Why? Because the sound of my own death would be much more enjoyable then listening to five seconds of this...this, I dont know. Anyone who calls this music needs to stop and actually realize what they're listening to. And Busta Rhymes? He was good when he was yelling ""woohaw!"" in the ninties, but now he's just a crappy has been. So seriously, how the hell did these people get a record deal? I have yet to find a halfway decent answer..."
1,Pathetic (1 Star),"Is the song catchy? Yes. Will it sell well over a million copies? Yes. What's even scarier is the fact that this song was out not even an entire year ago and folks are eating this up as if it was new. Two words: Tori Alamaze. And Busta Rhymes adds nothing to the song either. Busta has been washed up for quite some time now. Yeah, he was tight at some point, but he's garbage now and this is coming from someone who had respect for Busta at some point (I have his first 5 albums). Dude is washed up and these Pussycat chicks are just another talentless product of the MTV machine. This act will be totally forgotten by October."
1,A&M blows it!,"The Pussy Cat Dolls come off lame in their presentation as Pop Stars. They are like a watered down version of the Spice Girls, only without being self aware of the cheese factor, which makes them bar far, dare I say it, lamer.Top that off with them trying to break through, with someone else's recent break through song . . . and you have a recipe for disaster. This new version's vocal lacks the gritty honesty of the original vocal, by Tori Alamaze. That is what made the original popular. The music has been over produced and now sounds terrible. Not even a cameo by Busta Rhymes (probably his weakest to date) can save this sinking ship. A&M; records has made an awful choice and should bury this single and re-promote the original. (which you can still buy on this website).A&M; be ashamed . . . be very very ashamed! you blew it. A great song that could have made you a lot of money . . . ruined.Don't buy this single."
3,RHONDA,"What's up with all the negativity? Music is not suppose to determine how you live your life; it's just suppose to be fun and take your mind off the hum drum of everyday life. This song definately makes you forget about everyday life. This is just a fun song. I am a nurse and I see plenty of sadness. I don't choose to make a song that's not ""wonderful"" or how the group dresses a big event.No, the lyrics are not great, but the music is fun. Loosen up people and enjoy the music. I think it is a really fun song."
1,boastful music that rots,"What's with the chorus of this song? It's so obnoxious! ""Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?"" The singer isn't hot at all in my opinion and can't sing worth crap. This song annoys me in every aspect, has oh so despicable lyrics, a terrible beat, and is just an abomination to modern music. This song gives me chills I hate it so much. Don't buy this freakin' single, it is sooooooooooooooo bad. Girls can't rap either"
1,Bad but surprisingly successful,"""The Pussycat Dolls,"" six women who are ok-looking but don't have good voices, have recorded a crappy single with a mediocre beat and corny lyrics. The entire song goes something like this: ""Don't cha wish your girlfriend was wrong like me, don't you wish she was a freak like me..."" over and over again! There's nothing wrong with sexually strong women, but give me a break, how monotonous can you get? Plus, they all sound like they're about to fall asleep while singing.The beat is sloppy, with random instrumental sounds every four seconds. It's too slow to be a dance song and too fast to be anything else.Nothing to get too excited about, just your typical one hit wonder."
2,Not now or ever....,"I don't know why but i figured that since this song was doing so well on the charts. That there had to be something good about the song..but sadly i was mistaken and the only good thing about this song is that Busta Rhymes is on it. Well that of course and a few minutes later it's over with. Those are the only redeeming qualities of this song. I expected a bit better from Nicole (used to be in that girl group Eden's Crush). But nah its not appealing, not happening and i dont care for the vocals in any form. The message behind the song is something that i normally wouldnt care about but in this case. Its hard to not be like huh? I dont wish i had a girlfriend like that..""don't cha"" nah not in the least. They can keep this song and file it under D for dont listen to again."
1,Pop trash,"Well, if you want lame watered down trash with no meaning, then this is the song for you. I saw it once and it was filled with the o so meaningful and heartfelt lyrics "" Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me"" give me a break. You're better off buying new album's by artists such as Obituary, Nile, Necro A.K.A the Sexorcist, The Black Dahlia Murder, Arch Enemy and so on. I mean, who actually listens to and enjoys music like this?"
4,Love the song!,"(Im 17 under my fathers email account)I loveeee this song. Its so catchy and upbeat. At first hearing this song I didnt know who it was by but I loved the song, then I saw the video on either MTV or VH1 and saw Nicole Sherzinger (sp?) from the girl group ""Edens Crush"". Being a fan of ""Edens Crush"" I was so happy to see her doing something since the group went down the drain (miss them).This song is deff one for the club. If you havent heard it yet (which I'd be surprised if you havent) go check it out! Its great :D"
1,"mindless, vapid, crap","I'm not surprised to see Busta in this video, he's a sellout who'll be in any video or single as long as you give him some money. Obviously any amount of money will do.The music is third rate and the lyrics are laughable. Undoubtably this will move some units and MTV will play it death before these girls even achieve their seven and a half minutes of fame.This track won't even make it on the radar of VH1's list of ""Worst Songs of 2005.""But, you know, the girl who sings it is hot. And it makes for some good eye candy. Just mute the TV and you'll survive."
3,"An ""ok"" song that grows on you","I'll admit...when I first heard this song I absolutely hated it. My friends in NC and MD kept raving about this song. I had never heard it. The song hadn't been played in Houston, TX. I heard the song in July when I went to visit my friend in NC. It did nothing for me. The song eventually reached Houston in August and the only reason I listened to it was because I was trying to win Destiny's Child tickets (and I did win). The first few times the song was played I ignored it, but like any song (well, some songs) that's played constantly...it eventually grows on you.I learn lyrics to songs in a day...1 week tops...but I still don't know the lyrics to this song. Right now it's just the beat that's catchy. The music makes you want to dance."
3,Nice Summer Hit,"When I first heard this song I thought it was ok and cute. Nothing special. But upon hearing it again and again, it becomes this amazing ear worm that will not leave the brain. I love this song now, it's fun and just perfect for the summer. It's not a very artistic song, but who cares! It's fun to dance and hang out to. I've been seeing other reviews about comparisons to Tori Alamaze's version, but that's a mistake. This is a individual song and should be rated on it's own merit. One thing is for certain though and can't be bashed by anyone, people will adore this song because it represents everything summer is, carefree enjoyment. Plus, these girls are simply freakin' hott!"
1,Don't cha wish the Pussycat Dolls could sing?,"""Don't cha"" is the Pussycat Dolls' collective ode to stealing other women's boyfriends. It's their way of saying ""we're so hot,so irresistible."" Ugh. Maybe if they COULD sing,""Don't cha"" would be FUN bubblegum pop. Instead,it's annoying. There are stupid saxophone riffs to make it ""jazzy.""""Don't cha"" ranks as one of the WORST pop songs ever. It's rank. Avoid."
4,I definitely like it,"I dont know if I have ever heard the original song that was mentioned in the other reviews, but I think it is a cute song. It has a Prince feel to it, not to compared the Pussycat Dolls to Prince of course."
5,Do some research and get the facts first people!,"I love this song! It is upbeat and fun although the lyrics dont have much depth but who cares. I guess when you have been put in a situation like the one they are singing about you will understand unless you are the ""girlfriend"". But to all the haters of this song, Tori Alamaze gave up all of her rights to this song after a short period of time when the song did not immediately become a hit. She did not even write the song! Can you believe Cee-lo wrote the song and he knew it would be a hit so he recruited the PussyCat Dolls to ""redo"" the song and now the song has become a success. In case you havent noticed at the end of the video Cee-lo makes a brief cameo. So PCD didnt steal anything from Tori Alamaze, they were simply given a chance to make a hit song by the person who wrote it because the initial singer couldnt do it. And thats the facts."
1,The Worst Song ever?!,Wish there was zero stars! Quite possible this is the worst song ever! Makes me wish for the Apocolipse.
1,Garbage (Rating: 0 out of 10- -0 stars),"This song sucks. The Vagina Cat Dolls song ""Don't Cha"" is pretty stupid and overrated. I hear that song on every commercial, and they play this song into the ground at my school at every party. These girls remind me of the group Dream from Bad Boy back in 2001, sexy females with no singing talent. That is what is shown on this album, no singing talent what so ever. But Dr. Dre said ""Sex sells"", but I'm glad that I didn't buy their full length CD. As for Busta Rhymes, he does absolutely nothing to this song. Not even his fast rhyming can save this song. Although if you're one of those people who listen to those radio stations where they play a lot of mainstream music or watch MTV alot, then you will love this song and probably their CD. I find it to be just overrated to the core. Word to any other pop artist that uses sex appeal with no singing talent. 0 stars!"
2,Don't cha wish they'd give you back your money,"Well, for starters I think that you have to seriously ask yourself why you are searching for deep meaning from a group called ""The Pussycat Dolls."" Unlike ""The New York Dolls"" who revolutionized punk rock, these ladies are not going to bring the musical world to its knees. However, this will likely become an anthem for Ladies' Night at your local dance club and will get lots of play at bachelorette parties.Let's face it folks. It's been a cruel summer. Gwen Stefani taught the world to spell ""bananas"" with her tune ""Hollaback Girl."" Why should this group who are better known for their abs than arias be any different?"
4,Not that bad,"This song is not that bad. I don't see how anyone can hate it, it is done pretty well. The video is good too."
2,"Don Cha Wish Your Girlfriend Was A Slut, Like Me?","Well, that's kind of how I figured this song, after seeing the video. Kind of sounds like what an ex-girlfriend would say to you, after she comes back 20 pounds lighter, in an effort to make you wish you'd stuck with her (I have an ex like this).Actually, this group is like a long string of ""girl"" groups, i.e. Expose, the Flirts, Company B, the Spice Girls, the Cover Girls, Sweet Sensation and heaven knows how many others: girls that can sing kind of, look sexy with all the songs written and produced by a man (or men) with some serious sexual frustration, or perhaps trying to answer some gay or transexual questions within themselves.Okay, that's probably a bit much; but this song is gonna be about it for the PCDs. They might get a couple more suggestive songs and vids out of it, but after that, they'll be on the slush pile, and the subject of a Where Are They Now question on VH-1."
1,....sigh....,"...well...just when you thought the world couldn't get any worse here come the PUSSY CAT DOLLS...i mean really...even the band name is incredibly stupid and unoriginal. these girls and their and song aren't even worth negative a million stars, let alone one. they are nothing and they know it...it shows in their song - they have low self esteem, so to make themselves feel better they have to flash everything to the world and agree to be sexually explicit in their lyrics lol. but i do admit...that...yes...it is catchy...so just download it :)"
3,Catchy yet Trashy,"Sigh. An embarrassing guilty pleasure, perhaps. I personally like it if for no other reason than it's catchy and I like the guilty rush of listening to something so trashy. But I'm a full-grown woman, whereas this song is marketed toward pre-teens, who are still trying to get a grasp on their sexuality and their own worth.The fact that these girls performed this song at the teen choice awards is, in one word, pathetic. Would I listen to it? Sure. Would I mind my 19 year-old little sister listening to it? Nah. Do I want my 12 year-old sister hearing this? NO."
1,WTF - WHY???,"""dont cha want your girlfrend to be a slut like me, dont you want your girlfrend to be OLD like me, crap i'm really getting sick and tired of this type of music. These skanks are nothing but soccer moms all dressed in dominatrix outfits. Jesus, these old hags are pretty conceeded, i dont know how ppl put up with this sh*t, this is pure garbage! This song is boring and overdone. 1/5 (1 for the cheap laughs me and some friends got for the horrid lyrics) SKIP THIS"
3,"Decent track, but it follows within the same realm...","This track is decent as the beat & music makes for good grinding at the club, but for it having more substance besides that, I am not sure. The rap by Busta Rhymes is the usual i-am-going-to-make-a-woman-into-a-object rap done by so many other rappers which has become beyond boring. Vocally, the lead singer is sufficient for this type of music as she is not as nasally as some of these other 'singers' out there, but her vocals sound more like she is talking and just lengthening some syllables than actually singing. But the song has a decent hook which can keep the tune in someone's head after listening to it. Overall the song is not bad but not excellent either as the lead singer, Busta Rhymes, and the music itself does not go outside of the realm of pop's processed, radio-friendly style.Also, one shouldn't base a song solely because someone may look good to you, but they may have no artistry substance to back them up."
1,Don't Cha,"I thought this was a video and it wasn't. Actually, I bought two of these pieces of crap. The music is okay but I wanted the video. Accordingly, I wouldn't buy this song without it being a video; period. Waste of money."
5,"It is truly, ""The best""","I personally own 68 albums by Al, and I wouldn't part with any of them for love, nor money."
4,one of our great poets,"how do you discuss 23 years, the last half of a great poet's long career, in such a short allotment of space. you really can't. i will say that some of his better works is in the first volume. that isn't much more i can say than pick up his collected works."
5,Richmond VA Rocks!!!,"Richmond, Viginia home to some of the greatest bands of our generation. If you like this, which you will, go check out other local acts like The Gepetto File and Cough."
5,Our Baby's Bedtime,"My 18 month old son and I both love this book. I think he can really relate to the illustrations for several reasons. First of all, the characters, like his family and himself, are black people. Secondly, the book shows the family doing things that we do as a family such as reading, singing, giving the baby a bath, and giving the baby a good night kiss. This book reflects a normal, two parent family who have a lot of love for their child. What could be healthier?"
5,Excellent bedtime story that stands the test of time,I have read this story to all 4 of my children almost every night for 10 years. Every one of my children loved it and my oldest now recalls it with fond memories. I purchased a copy to keep to read to my grandchildren one day.
4,"Watched with Martyrs, and strongly preferred this film!","I watched Inside and Martyrs within a couple days of one another, and while I hated Martyrs, I LOVED Inside. Both are gross films, and I'd be hard pressed to say which is more unsettling. But Martyrs felt hopeless and empty at the end, and while I understand that that was its point, I will never rewatch it. I will almost certainly rewatch Inside, which is just a great, fun horror movie. It has a real slasher sensibility. It's super gross, sure, but it isn't hopeless like Martyrs was. It just feels like everyone involved is having so much fun. The crew, I mean. Not the characters. The characters are decidedly NOT having that much fun. I mean, here's a movie where two women are locked in a house, while one of them tries to TAKE the other woman's unborn baby. It's a gaudy and over-the-top premise and they wring every bit of suspense and horror they can from it!"
5,unlike anything i have ever seen....i loved it!,"NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH...THIS MOVIE IS VERY VIOLENT AND BLOODY. I WON'T GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE PLOT. READ OTHER REVIEWS FOR THAT. I'LL JUST SAY THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN...AND I HAVE SEEN ALOT. WHAT MAKES THIS ONE DIFFERENT IS ALL OF THE EMOTIONS THAT COME INTO PLAY. IT'S ABOUT LOVE AND LOSS... THE LOSS OF A DREAM, THE LOSS OF A FAMILY..LONLINESS AND DESPERATION TO HAVE A CHILD AT ANY COST. I CAN REALLY FEEL FOR THE CHARACTERS. WATCH IT, YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT. THE IMAGES STAY WITH YOU... I HAD TO BUY IT."
2,Don't waste your time/money,"So I purchased this movie just based on horror fans reviews saying this was a must see. After watching it, it kinda felt like a waste of time. There were good elements and the story line was ok, but I just didn't find it to be very captivating. Things I liked: the gore. Things I didn't like: everything else. It didn't seem to make a lot of sense at times. I am a big horror buff and I didn't think it was anything to remember."
2,extreme gore!,"This movie is by far the best horror movie I have seen in a very long time! It is original, intense, and ultra gory!Highly recommended!Buy this movie, you won't regret it! ; )Oops, I meant to give this movie 5 stars, not 2 stars!! Duh!"
3,Blood and More Blood,"This was okay. It really depends on what you're looking for in a horror flick. A widowed pregnant Mom and a deranged woman who lost her baby and still wants one spend Christmas Eve battling it out in a VERY bloody, gore strewn encounter. It has a few tense stalking moments, but most of the horror here comes from the act of harvesting another's baby in the messiest way possible. Exploding heads, gouged eyeballs, abdomen cutting (with shears - no less)and a the reddest walls since those outside the elevator bank in The Shining. More of a gross-out horror than anything, but if that's your cup of tea, enjoy."
1,Just another horror film...,"Bought this DVD solely based on other reviews of this title, even though I'm not much into horror type films to begin with. This title certainly didn't do much for me, and in my opinion, certainly didn't live up to other reviews of this title. As far as the 'gore' raved about in this film, it really wasn't anything special with respect to gore type horror films. Really nothing any more, or anything new, than one would expect from this type of film. Certainly even an old film such as the Exorcist far exceeds the 'gore' factor of this film. Sorry I bought it... For those considering purchasing it, rent it first. Oh, and the 'lip sync' or dubbed speech... whatever they did, was pretty obvious."
1,I'm not a psychopath,"I'm really disturbed this sick movie got 5 stars from other viewers cause unless u are a psycko u can't get to love this movie except if u are only a gore-fan.This movie has a lot of gore and that's that. Now i'm a horror fan. Not a gore fan. I like more the plot stories the mystery, the suspense, the real horror movies which are not present gore as their main element.Gore does not scare me. IT MAKES ME SICK."
3,DISGUST/GORY & GREAT!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE LACKS NOTHING WHEN IT COMES TO HORROR. I READ LOTS OF THE REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING IT, AND I'M GLAD I BOUGHT IT! HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THIS GRUESOME IN A LONG TIME. (INSIDE) HAS IT ALL. THERE ARE SOME SCENES IN THE MOVIE THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE BUT THE OVERALL MOVIE ITSELF ONCE IT GETS GOING WILL HAVE YOU ON THE EDGE OF WHATEVER YOUR SITTING ON. IT'S DEFENITLY A MOVIE BUFF'S COLLECTOR."
5,"Inside was stuck inside my head for a long time, scary as hell","Let me start off by saying that i watched this film about a month ago, and it's still stuck in the back of my mind. It's got everyhting, it's gory, and scary as hell. I have recommended this film to many people, people need to see this masterpiece. The voice overs were great except for the police officer, just didn't sound convincing.This film is worth every penny i spent, and i'll leave it that."
4,get Inside!,"This movie is a real gore fest! Blood spurting from necks and so on.After a pregnant woman's husband is killed in a crash the terror begins.A strange unstable woman appears on Christmas Eve to use the womans phone.The cat and mouse game begins!It's scary! It's gruesome and you'll be saying ""That's messed up!"" What a great movie! I tink I'll Buy it!"
2,Undone By Excess Carnage,"Beatrice Dalle really delivers here, and the premise is rather unique - too bad it's all undercut by FAR too much gore. A shame, because at first it feels like a French giallo, which would be very interesting indeed. If there was a more understated version of this it might achieve cult status; as it is, it's just a test of your endurance (or your stomach)."
4,From a horror fan,"Well, when they label this one EXTREME they were not joking. It is a simple plot and a somewhat surprise ending that made sense. some could figure it out early on in the film. but the gore is some of the most realistic I have ever seen.... and not for the squeamish at all. well done effects. very creepy!!"
3,Well worth the Hype,"I read about this film many times before purchasing it and i kept wondering is it true? is this film really what it hyped up to be? i put it in the player and was dam near blown away. Crazy females, gore galore, scissors; who could ask for anything more!! Not gonna give away any of the film..you gotta see it for yourself, but as a mother this film moved and disgusted me!"
1,"Vile, Boring Nonsense","I like horror and I don't mind gore if it, like nudity or sex, serves the story in some way. This is just a mean-spirited, ugly movie that lacks imagination so it attempts to make up for it with gruesome violence. If that's all you're looking for in a movie then a) good luck with that and b) enjoy this thing. It's pace is excruciatingly slow and it succumbs to nearly every cliche you can imagine--the killer, who is simply an averagely built female, somehow manages to be superhuman for no good reason, or rather everyone else is transformed into a weakling when convenient for the ""plot"" (and I use the term loosely); everyone she kills is equally stupid in some way or other; the revenge plot that is often repeated is repeated again here. Just an awful, dull, unpleasant, derivative film that deserves none of the accolades given by other viewers."
4,Wow. Really well done!,"I wasn't too sure about this film since the cover looked like one of those, ""The cover is better than the movie."" Actually, I wish they hadn't given so much away on the cover! Great beginning, great ending, excellent effects. Even the CGI is pretty good - not being a fan of CGI myself. Very dark and creepy story. I have to admit being scared a couple of times. :) Beatrice Dalle is just wonderful and very spooky!! A must have!"
3,Very Very SSIck!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,"This is the sickest movie since ""Maniac"" in the 80's! Buyer take notice, this is a French well acted gorefest, but a one time watch, simply put to disturbing gore for me and Ive' been a horror fan for 20+years. Nothing likeable or funny in the film for fun's sake. I'ts not Friday the thirteenth, where the characters are likable or you care or don't if they die, more like a slow start to a hospital emergency room, taken over by the antichrist. lots of that red stuff, eat first! PS. What's with the french? They are making sick demented mildly entertaining horror films, if only they had the balls to fight for other causes?!! Proud to be an American."
4,Couldn't stop watching...,"I didn't know what to expect. Wow! This film was sick and disturbing yet at the same time I could not turn away. **Small Spoilers** Ok, the main Character was not that bright and should have left the house. Police were absolute morons. Overall this film was infact disturbing yet something a bit different. I enjoyed it because the gore looked very real, the acting was decent (well watchable) and it was creepy as hell!"
5,"If you're a true horror fan, INSIDE is a MUST!",Words just cannot describe the experience that is this movie. Even after hearing how brilliant it was I still wasn't expecting a lot from it. This went above and beyond my expectations and is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. The set-up is really well-done and creepy. Especially the stuff with the woman outside the window. There are some really brilliant shots and the atmosphere is great. And once it gets going it doesn't let up. This is easily one of the bloodiest films I've ever seen.Anyone who calls themselves a horror fan has to see this film. The French sure know their horror.
1,5-Star Reviews = Viral Marketing for a stupid film..,"Inside is a tribute to the ""Idiot Plot"" - that is a plot that would'nt work unless everyone in the film is a halfwit. This bloody, pointless film is about a pregnant woman hunted by a crazy person in her home. She locks herself in the bathroom while the crazy person stabs at the bathroom door with a knife and screams.But then things get really stupid. The killer is a woman who weighs maybe 120 pounds - she kills four full-grown men! 2 of them are armed cops! One of the cops is in the house when the lights go out, so he goes into the basement to turn the lights back on! Yikes - now THAT'S stupid..Of course, none of the cops called for help when they were OUTSIDE and they noticed that something was wrong - double Yikes..Skip this mess."
2,Subs,It would probly be a good movie if the thing was in English it sucks when you have to read what they say
1,subtitles suck,"i wish i had read that the movie was all foriegn. so if your into that, this might not be bad for you, however i can't read and watcha a movie at the same time. sucked in my opinion, but then again i only got threw 30 minutes of it before i was bored with reading the movie"
1,Don't believe the hype.,"I read all these glowing reviews and immediately pulled out this movie and watched it. Wow what a waste of time, this movie was so sub par I just can't believe all the positive reviews for it. Low budget / limited locations doesnt have to be this bad (see [REC] for example)"
4,Great movie,"I had heard about this movie online a couple years ago and finally just had to buy it to see what the hype was about. I'm a huge horror fan so for me this movie was excellent. Very psychological and graphic effects. The ending scene is disturbing, but in a good way to a fan of this genre of movies."
5,Amazing French Horror Film,"A friend recommended I see this film and they were so right. The story line ties together well and the acting is very well done. If you have a weak stomach for gore, do not watch this film!"
1,Doesn't come close to the 1978 original release.,"This collection in 1978 contained Don't Cuss that Fiddle, Crime still don't pay, and Welcome to 2003. Three great songs not available anywhere else. And, the only reason to buy this title (WAS). This pathetic release isn't worth buying. Why did BMG/RCA leave out songs? And then have the nerve to give it the same title?"
3,"Frustrated, angry, and disappointed!","Some great early outlaw music but for those of us that remember (or have) the origional album this CD is a BIG disappointment. I think it is criminal that RCA chose to delete some of the best songs from the album and market it as the origional. If I were an attorney I would let RCA know exactly how displeased I am in court. On the plus side, I think it contains the best version of ""Momma's Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys"" ever recorded."
1,"THIS SENSOR FITS THE REAR, NOT THE FRONT ON A C36 AMG","PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS SENSOR IS FOR THE REAR SENSOR, NOT THE FRONT AS SHOWN!"
5,Not just another linux book.,"This book is a must have for the NT/2000 person who wants to know more about linux. Those of us with a solid background in NT are now able to leverage much of that knowledge to quickly get past many of the linux hurdles. This book has clear examples and will answer many questions in a way that you will understand. If you are curious about linux and know NT, do yourself a favor and buy this book first."
3,Book for NT admins,"The overall content of the book is adequate for those new to Linux but is a bit dated (Written for OS versions well over two years ago) With new book available I would recomend buying Linux Administration: A Beginner's Guide, a great book. This book focuses entirely too much on Windows rather than Linux which is what it is supposed to be about."
4,Mostly a good book,"It's a great resource to have, coming from the Windoze world. For a beginner in Linux though, gets a little too deep and spends a lot of time on Xwindows. This may prove very useful later, but for now, I just skipped most of that. Would I buy it again? Absolutely. I've got mine filled with sticky notes to note key pages for troubleshooting, etc."
2,Disappointing,"I always thought that a decoder ring was something that you got out of a box of cracker jacks. But Minasi's offering is no prize.The problem: Minasi tries to cover every popular distribution of Linux in just 500 pages. He generalizes, much to the frustration of the novice user.Indeed, there is useful information contained within ""The Secret Decoder Ring"" , but as the reader you often feel that you need a decoder ring to find it."
5,More good work,Yet another quality work from Fr. Paul. The learning begins on page one and doesn't stop until the last. Add it to your collection.
3,Brutally uncompromising...,"Bloodrock's debut doesn't stand the test of time as well as the rest of their catalog, but it's still a fine album full of interesting music if somewhat cheesy lyrics now and then. The centerpiece is Fantastic Piece Of Architecture, an extended dirge that succeeds quite well, despite its length and marked lack of dynamics, due to Jim Rutledge's profound interpretation of the lyrics. The rest of the album is a rough mix of what their following albums would boil down to a unique brand of heavy rock/metal that followed its own path, critics be damned."
3,"Good for sophisticated users, but lacks thoroughness","It has a good amount of detail, but lacks many features thatare now quite commonplace. END"
2,Definitive Reference?,"This book is suppose to be ""The Definitive Reference for Dynamic HTML."" If that's what it's suppose to be, then why are there only 126 of 1100 pages devoted to DHTML? If I were you I would pass on this book if you're looking for a help with DHTML. You'll end up spending more time searching on the web for answers and references rather than this book.The book does cover DOM, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. But what I was looking for was straight DHTML. The title really threw me off. Theres more pages devoted to DOM then there are for DHTML."
3,Disappointed,...I purchased this book. I thought it would be a how-to book but it isn't. I feel as if I wasted (Money)because the book is useless to me since it's way over my head.
2,Good Reference,"I own Danny Goodman's JavaScript Handbook from circa 1996. That has nothing to do with this review other than to say this guy has been doing this stuff for a long time. This is a great reference book to have handy and has good examples of each tag, element, or keyword in HTML, DOM, CSS, and JavaScript."
5,Excellent book for all developers,"This is a really useful book, IMO, for developers of all skill levels. The book's strongest point is how it explains how to write for the different kinds of browsers out there...great for site planning! My only complaint is the book doesn't have a code disk or web site--but I wouldn't let this stop me. Bottom line, a really useful book."
4,The value of an out-of-date book,"In designing a new DHTML website for a client that is at the cutting edge of technology, we carefully made it compatible ""down"" a browser or two (with a default site for non-compliant older browsers) -- only to discover after launch that half the client's employees have Netscape 4.06 installed as the official company browser. This book is just the reference I need; for one thing it will remind me (and other web designers) that not everyone is using my favourite browser on my machine with the latest version of every bell and whistle -- and show the way to maximising audience with a creative, stable, and efficient website that doesn't depend on installing IE 9.5. And O'Reilly have never let me down."
3,Excellent Reference for HTML and JS Compatibility,"Although there are many topics on DHTML in this book (some useful, some not, some inaccurate), this books strength is as a reference to browser compatibility. It's somewhat dated now and could use an update, but should still prove useful for browsers up to early 4 versions. This is also an excellent HTML and JS reference, offering many useful details on each.This book is an essential book for every web developer-the perfect complement to an existing library."
1,Worst book by Goodman _or_ O'Reilly ever,"I have been a fan of Danny Goodman's books since the heyday of HyperCard, and a fan of O'Reilly & Associates since I first played with Perl many years ago. But this book is far below the standards both have set with their previous works. I have found it to be nearly useless in practice: the index is a vestigial afterthought; the organization of the core reference sections is unwieldy and counterintuitive; the page layout and navigation elements (such as guide entries and section headings) give local information only and don't help the reader maintain a sense of where in the (deep and byzantine) section hierarchy they are. I'm sure a large part of the blame should rest on the chaotic subject itself, but the reputations attached to this book lead to the expectation that it will make sense of a muddied topic, and it just doesn't. This is the first Goodman or O'Reilly book for which I really just want my money back."
4,Great Reference - Not for those looking for tutorials,It's a good book - just not meant for individuals looking for a series of tutorials.
3,Book Index sucks,"I used to have the previous edition. I could quickly find objects and properties in the books index and just go to what I wanted. This new edition doesn't even have the event handling properties such as onmouseover and such. Its also missing some minor properties for css or html. I know the big ones, its the minor ones that i need help on. Its great that it takes into account safari, mozilla and opera compatibility, but they really did a crappy job on the index. Apparently they wanted to safe paper and removed some things from it. so, now I use the old edition and new edition. A big inconvenience."
3,"Good reference guide, but lacking in detail","Pros:+ Pretty easy to look up a specific style property, object property, Javascript property, etc.+ Each property shows whether it is compatible with Netscape, IE, DOM, CSS, etc.Cons:- Often lacks necessary detail: ""Not all event types assigned a constant value are yet implemented as events in Navigator 4."" (OK, which ones??)- Very subtle differences in typefonts between major headings (i.e. HTML tags) and sub-headings (properties for a tag), making it easy to get lost ."
5,Awesome - my BIBLE,"I am a professional DHTML developer and this book is my BIBLE. No other work has so comprehensively and thoroughly documented *cross-browser* Javascript, DOM, HTML, and CSS in one place. It very clearly tells you what is available and what will and will not work on various browsers and versions -- something that is otherwise extremely difficult to cull from widespread sources.The reviewers here that have given this book a low rating because it isn't a concise tutorial are silly. It's not a tutorial -- it's an excellent, comprehensive reference meant for people who already are somewhat familiar with the basic concepts of DHTML. Once you learn the basics and encounter the nightmare of cross-browser scripting, you will surely appreciate the scope and magnitude of this truly definitive work. This is THE single DHTML reference to have."
3,JavaScript !,"Simply, It's NOT the book I was looking for.I had ""JavaScript bible"" for ""GOODMAN"" before that, and it was better (But still NOT that good book though).I'm MCSD certified, had alot of writing with JavaScript and none of the two javascript books I have meet my satisfication.I have been looking for ""Real-time JavaScript programming"" book (Deals with JavaScript as real and powerful scriptable language NOT a couple of effects and decorations) .I have to admit it, this book serves as a good REFERENCE no more.And still NOT that good reference 'cause too many things had changed since this book was published .Want a JavaScript reference ?Run to more decent books that has the update for new browsers and codes ."
2,Not as good as it seems,"Well here is the story:My friend and i work as web designers. Well we desided to learn some dhtml and starting looking through books, then we desided to buy 2 books, so that when we'd finish them we could exchange. Well I bought this book and my friend got ""DHTML and JavaScript"". I was really excited, because i wanted to learn some DHTML and learn how to use layers. CSS was not really my concern because i already read many online pages with tutorials and i know it pretty well(SO as javaScript). Well, when i opened the book i was really disappointed beacuse the book dosn't even talk about layers. Just CSS and JavaScript which was complete waste for me. Well when i looked at my friend's book, that book really got me interesting it has a very good coverage of both Layers and how to use them combined with css and js...The book also included a very good reference table for css commands. I think that ""DHTML and JavaScript""(isbn: 0130863343 ) book is a much better deal."
3,"Good reference at the time, but now outdated...","This is not a book for a beginner, but for the more experienced developer. This book is packed with information. If I had purchased this book when it was first published, I would have given it 5 stars. However, the book was published in 1998, and the content is getting dated -- enough so that I mildly regret buying this book, thus the 3-star rating. Even so, if an updated edition comes out, I will buy it, for an up-to-date reference of this calibre would be a well-thumbed book on my shelf."
5,Great Reference,"This ia a great reference for any tags that you are unsure of how to use, if it's supported, what attributes are available. I highly reccomend it as reference material, if you're looking for anything else like how to do web design then you're in the wrong place. This is meant for the experienced HTML coder."
4,You need this book,"This is a great, comprehensive reference book for those needing the specifics about DHTML. In addtion to the DHTML and HTML sections, it includes a DOM Reference, CCS Reference and a Javascript Reference.It points out differences in HTML 4, IE and NN. (Keeps you from wasting your time if you are seeking cross browser compatibility).Along with the Definitive Guides to HTML and Javascript, this is a must have !"
3,"Not suitable as an introduction, but a good reference.","This is not the book for you, if you are new to dynamic HTML and scripting (JavaScript or VB Script). I made the mistake of buying it too soon, before I learned the basics. This book seems like a good reference, but I suspect it will become out-of-date soon, due to the nature of browser wars."
5,"The Bible, Third Edition","The finest review of this book I can give is simply this: I bought the first edition in 1999, the second edition in 2003, the third edition in 2007, and as long as Danny Goodman and O'Reilly keep up the good work, I'll buy the fourth edition in 2011. There is no more indispensible book available for the Web GUI professional.One caveat: This book is not for beginners. If you don't already know how to build a modern DHTML/CSS/JS/Ajax interface, this book will likely be a waste of money. Moreover, if you're looking for how-tos and recipes, look elsewhere. This is a comprehensive encyclopedia of the DHTML universe, nothing more and nothing less."
2,Annoying Songs,"Does anyone really need to know how to say nice purple tie? I wanted to learn basic italian, but what I got instead was annoying songs that got in the way of learning the language. My kids were laughing so hard at the lame songs that we forgot what we were trying to learn! While it was good to have the book that goes along with the CD, the formate and the some of the first lessons were not where I wanted to start out (scrambled eggs vs fried?). The lessons did get better as you went along. If you don't mind learning italian Sesame Street style, then this is the CD for you."
3,"A bit buono, a bit cattivo","Good things--the songs will stick in your head, and this will help memorization. There is a logical progression. The accompanying book generally helps, especially if you're like me and want to see the word as well as hear it. It is espeically useful in some of the pronunciations not always covered in guide books.Bad parts--the main male character has an awful pop voice. The romance story-line can get uncomfortable; when he is singing about how he wants her to kiss/hold/touch him now, I wanted to leave the room. And some of the choices are foolish. If you are only going to learn the basics, wouldn't you rather know how to talk about sights than how to leave a message or tell someone they have a nice refrigerator?Since I expected the songs to be cheesy, I can't hold that against them. But I expected better thinking of what lessons would be covered. My advice to Berlitz would be to skip having a plot and focus on what we actually need to know."
5,From London to Paris and Back in a Canoe,"A publicity stunt!This entry in the Mariners Library (#24) is notable because MacGregor made his 1867 voyage from London to Paris in order to promote his canoe design. MacGregor was a great 19th century marketer, seeking royal patronage for his 21 foot yawl which was one of the great forerunners of the modern canoe.First Thus, baby blue cloth over boards with navy details in dustjacket; 214 pp with a few illustrations."
5,Solo Sailing as Marketing Campaign...,"...or even publicity stunt.This entry in the Mariners Library (#24) is notable because MacGregor made his 1867 voyage from London to Paris in order to promote his canoe design. MacGregor was a great 19th century marketer, seeking royal patronage for his 21 foot yawl which was one of the great forerunners of the modern canoe.First Thus, baby blue cloth over boards with navy details in dustjacket; 214 pp with a few illustrations."
2,Inadequacies,"This book had two main problems.Firstly, the original page numbers were repeated in the text in three different formats: a straight number, a phrase such as 'page 23', and both of these enclosed in brackets.The lack of cosistency I found very distracting.Secondly, none of the original illustrations were included. The text refers to various illustrations to explain the author's descriptions but none of them have appeared in this electronic version. You had to follow the description of the boat layout and its style very closely and still had little idea as to what the boat looked like."
1,"A book for it's time, 1887.","The auther, a man of considerable education, means and ego, tells of the 1887 sailing of his 21 foot yawl, Rob Roy.Not written in the pleasant narrative of Joshua Slocum, (Sailing Alone Around The World) of his 1895-1898 voyage."
4,A philosophical approach,"Intense book. You can summarize it by saying ""The book is readable independently of your ability to understand it"". Is best if is used in a doctorate program where you can extrapolate the philosophy between the lines and the author's point of view. Final warning: Do not read this before going to bed."
3,"""Out Foxed""",I was worn down by the time the DVD was completed. This documentary seems to have tried to do too much causing me to lose interest and have trouble connecting all of the movements and information presented on screen.
5,The Hen House,"Although most of us who were drawn to the film could be considered as ""Preaching To The Choir"" there's plenty here to open eyes. It's basically what many of us have seen going on since shortly after Fox came into being. It's amazing though just how many people don't seem to question the one sided slant towards the extreme right wing. I'm guessing that this movie isn't going to get coverage on any network. I only hope that there's enough people who've never really noticed the extreme slant of Fox get a chance to view this. Then there will be less chance for Fox to rule the ""Hen House""."
1,Not journalism and not revalatory...,"Surprise, Fox has a republican bias. I suppose no one in the country could figure this one out.The fundamental flaw with this documentary is that it points the finger at Fox for all sorts of reasons, while comletely ignoring the fact that all other stations do the same thing to promote whatever agenda they want to promote.The reason Fox stands out is because it is the only station that does not have a leftist bias. And it's getting better ratings than any other news network. I mean the leftists are right all the time. How could anyone not have a leftist view point, much less give higher ratings to a station that has a republican view point. Obviously, those that watch Fox are knuckleheads."
2,SELLING THE NEWS,"THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY...BUT RATHER A BIASED COMMENTARY...HOWEVER IT IS TRUE....AM NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH FOX NEWS..HOWEVER WATCHING THE MAJOR NETWORKS ONE CAN SEE THE HYPE THAT IS GOING ON, AS THE FILM POINTS OUT.YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH TIME TO GET THE STORY IN AND GRAB THE AUDIENCE ....NETWORK NEWS AND THE CABLE CHANNELS ARE ENTERTAINMENT.....THEY HAVE BECOME THE NEW VERSION OF THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER....NOT REAL NEWS...BUT GRAB THE AUDIENCEWATCH WHAT YOU SEE, BUT BE AWARE IT MAY BE HYPED...FROM ALL SOURCES."
1,Bigots' delight,"If the Good Lord Himself started a television network and peopled it with His angels and saints, the devil could easily make a DVD like this about His leftist or rightist or upsidedownist leanings. Fox is biased, sure. But not nearly as much as, for instance, the BBC, which reviews this weird concoction of half-truths in a programme on 3 documentaries about Iraq, the other two being about Michael Moore and Al Jazeera. So yes, in comparison Fox is definitely fair and balanced."
1,Disappointed overall.....,"I thought this would be a little more ""educational"" - but turns out to be more like a propaganda film. It's bearable - but use your ""one free rental"" rather than actually paying for this one!"
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I guess my main complaint about this movie is the whole ""oh wow I can't believe Fox does that!"" Reaction they're trying to get out of the viewer. Just present the information, no need for ridiculous dramatization of it.I did give it 2 stars though because there's a few clips I haven't seen before like the apology. It was also interesting to hear from Jeremy Glick too."
3,2.5 stars,"This documentary had a chance to sxpose to bad practices used by Fox news, not just Fox News but most mainstream media outlets. While it did have some good info, most of it was interviews and opinion. There should have been more time spent on other news sources, and digging up better information."
2,Amazon writer is humorous,"I think it's funny and a little like the pot calling the kettle black, isn't it, for the ""professional"" Amazon reviewer to say that Fox is biased, especially when he himself has written such a completely biased review of the film? The reviewer obviously hates conservatives and Fox news, but it's okay for him to be biased. In fact, the really funny thing is that it's okay for Dems and liberals to be biased all they want, but when Fox or any other broadcaster portrays things with a little bit more reality and truth, the Dems get their underwear all in a bundle.And NBC, ABC, and CBS are NOT biased towards Democrats?!?! Come one, get a grip."
4,"Very inlightening, ""A need to see""","This is something that everyone needs to see so they can make there own judgement and see how the media is shaping the news to what see and don't see, what we hear and don't hear. ""PURE CENSORSHIP"" and it has an agenda."
5,Fair and Balanced Documentary,"By insisting that the rest of the media is left-leaning Fox News has somehow been exempt from criticism of it's neo-con bias... until now. Great film based on actual clips from Fox News. In the same way that Michael Moore uses video of George Bush to expose our fraudulent president, ""Outfoxed"" uses clips from Fox to give lie to the claim of fair and balanced."
1,Video Kool-Aid,"Typically shoddy agit-prop from another George Soros-funded leftist hate group. Strictly for die-hard lefty Kool-Aid (Drool-Aid?) drinkers, as is obvious from the ""positive"" reviews obviously planted by (big surprise here) ""MoveOn (to the gulag) .org."" Anyone claiming to find this worthwhile can safely be counted on to already have pictures of Hitler and Stalin in their wallet."
1,It's gotta be baloney.,"The left is beside themselves trying to stop the truth getting out there. As an ardent news watcher and reader of the web and books, I can only say this:We are so lucky to have Fox News! Exposing the left wing agenda and how it is destroying our culture and our way of life."
2,Technically....,"never seen it. Not planning to. Not into Lieni Refienstahl stuff. If we're talking about Rupert Murdoch right wing bias, okay, let's talk about Ted Turner and his bias against Israel, God, etc, etc. If you present one side, you must present the other, or you are simply a propagandist, much like Ms. Refienstahl or, at this time, Michael Moore. Is it a bad thing to present propaganda? Yes."
2,"Decent, but...","When you come right down to it, do you really need a documentary like this to tell you that Fox News is biased? As I was watching this I fealt like this wasn't telling me anything that I didn't already know. This whole documentary was ultimately underwhelming in the sense it is preaching to the converted and will be ignored by Fox News loyalists. This whole movies seems more like an attempt to exploit liberal anger over the current administration and apologists for it since this is becoming the new thing to cash in on.Being a pundit and documentary director has never been so profitable."
2,I give it an extra star for effort!,"I applaud the producers effort to expose the Fox News giant as a bias outlet. We need more investigative journalists in this country. Although, I don't approve of how or why they are doing it. You might notice that the 1st & 2nd name, after the producers, in the credits are ""Moveon.org"" and ""the Center for American Progress""; two far left 527's that actively promote thier agenda. How am I to believe that this is a fair criticism when it's being put on by two organizations that dislike Conservatives. Furthermore, Greenwald has started the new millennium by making no less than 5 anti-Republican/Conservative movies.This film doesn't even give Fox the chance to defend itself, and it doesn't imply that any other media source could be bias. I had hoped for both when I bought it.Just once I'd like a documentary put on by a non-partisan group...just once."
2,Conglomerate News Network,"Well done documentary, but not entirely true. ALL news networks are biased, and their slogans are all misleading. CNN calls itself the Most Watched News Channel, when FOX NEWS beats it in the ratings fairly often -- often enough to discredit that claim. All the major news networks are owned by conglomerate corporations such as AOL-Time-Warner, therefore, all are biased. Plain and simple. Get a grip, folks, all news media outlets are the same, so stop demonizing Fox News (the way you claim they demonize others) for its conformity."
2,So-So,"If you've watched Fox News for at least an hour, you won't learn anything new. ""Fox News has a right wing bias? No way!"" The only real insight comes from the ex-producers and former employees, especially by the ex-anchor who was suspended for failing to live up to his superiors' expectations when reporting Ronald Reagan's birthday. Other than that, you hear from a variety of far-left sources like the Orwellian sounding ""Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting,"" a news watchdog group that only complains about conservative or alleged rightwing bias in the news. Another key figure is MediaMatters ""CEO"" David Brock, a self-confessed liar and ex-hitman for the Clinton hating right, now a convenient subordinate of the George Soros Empire doing the same exact thing. I don't like Fox News, but I also don't recommend this movie unless you're a diehard Fox hater."
2,OK... we get the Point!!,"The folks who produced this flick sure have a knack for hammering the point. Yes we get it! Is Fox News evil? Unlikely, but you start to wonder who is fooling who. Unfair and unbalanced, sure, which network isn't? But Holy Smoke, the point is repeated like a woodpecker on a feeding frenzy. It might have been interesting to also interview current Fox News employees instead of exclusively Former Fox News employees...just to round out a fair and balanced documentary!"
5,Hard-hitting and well researched....,"I find it interesting how right-wing conservatives will attack this documentary apparently without having seen it. It is admittedly hard-hitting, but rightly so (pun intended!). Walter Kronkite and other respected journalists find FNC's tactics not only NOT ""fair and balanced,"" but contrary to all good journalistic practice. One only has to see some of the exchanges between Bill O'Reilly and those guests with whom he disagrees to conclude that FNC's agenda is to serve as a 24/7 promotion of the Repulican agenda -- not to provide ""fair and balanced"" news."
5,Not surprising,"I found this very entertaining and not at all surprising. Anyone who is objective politically to any degree can see the extreme bias that is Fox news. They don't have interviews, a question is asked then the anchor and GOP guest just agree for about 10 minutes before the Bush04 ad. Rupert is a genius, he has found a way of brain washing that is legal. Fox claims to love and support the troops, in fact claim to corner the market on it. Problem is they brush over the fact when it comes to reporting those who have lost their lives. They are only worthy of mention when alive. In death, silence. Fox some of us see through you."
3,Good Case - Extra Gravy Unnecessary,"The DVD makes a good case against Fox News. I have two major criticisms. First, the movie overuses ""horror"" music to strengthen its points, which in effect make them biased. Viewers should shriek by listening to the content, and not the music. Second, the creators should not have included the footage of the two anonymous interviewees because they damage the film's credibility."
4,Propaganda 101,"The DVD is very instructive on the most basic technique of propaganda, the repetition ad nauseum of a specific idea. The effect is stunning as the movie makers piece together a string of news clips, stretching across a period of time, with near identical messages, in many cases word for word. The readers and analysts who populate the Fox newsroom all look as if they walked off the pages of the National Enquirer, but they do have a role to play and they play it very well. They very often repeat lines, from newscast to newscast, verbatim even in different contexts such as ""newscasts"", interviews, opinion segments, and so on.It's no secret that this simple technique has a very pronounced effect on the impression people have of what's important and what is not. J. A. C. Brown wrote about this in the 1950s in his Techniques of Persuasion when the memory of Nazi Germany and its use of the big lie was still fresh. As Outfoxed shows clearly, the network has these techniques down cold."
4,Consumer Fraud,"What many reviewers here in this forum seem to have missed, especially those that gave it poor reviews, is what the documentary shows is that Fox News goes beyond a conservative bias. They accuse Fox News of ""Consumer Fraud"". Under the guise of ""Fair and Balanced"" and ""no-Spin Zone"", Fox news has a clear agenda of promoting Right-wing polices and conservative agenda to influence public opinion. They are actively engaged in Right-wing Propaganda. But they hide that from the consumer(viewer). Thus it is fraud.The reason for the four-stars is that this documentary, although well done and compelling, is produced by ""Move-on.org"" as well as other liberals, so it can easily be accused of bias. That alone is enough to discredit this documentary in the view of many conservatives. But if you are open minded and seeking the truth, I recommend viewing this and decide for yourself."
5,GOTTA LOVE IT!!!,Using the MEDIA to Bring Down the WORST MEDIA in America today.Nothing is sweeter then giving those a taste of their own medicine.But what makes is even better is that it's a great film... and we're right.
3,www.sportofdistraction.com,"I give 3 stars for the material & footage that this documentary brings to the attention of people that may or may not have been exposed to it before. The bias of the makers of this documentary is obvious & about as strong as garlic the next day following an Italian dinner coming out of your pores.So, the question should be, regardless of bias, is what this documentary true or false? The ridiculous nature in which FOX presents news, and the bias they ooze through the screen is disgusting and in need of exposure...and to that end this documentary is successful. Is it great?..probably not. Is it informative?..yes, depending on how much you already monitor FOX's slant.Bottomline: if you're extemely familiar with the ineptitude of the media & FOX's sick game they play with the whole ""Fair & Balanced"" thing...then don't bother buying this DVD...if you think FOX isn't that bad...please view this DVD at any cost."
5,Should be mandatory viewing for all Americans !,"Congratulations to director Robert Greenwald for exposing the truth about FoxNews. Yes, Murdoch is a marketing genius that has enabled him to brainwash millions of intelligent educated good Americans to his far right wing agenda....""Unfair and Unbalanced"" ! Fox does not report the News. ""Some people say"" it is nothing but pure commentary."
5,Never thought I'd see the day,"Great, out of left field expose on Fox's outrageous bias. The skewering of Bill O'Liely is the real highlight :)"
3,Fun....,"Vester's piece is allot of fun, but terribly biased. The humor in this is that the topic she is covering is equally biased."
5,A look into propaganda in a Democratic country.,"Very informative, insightful movie. Proves everything you have heard... that ""Fair and Balanced"" is the most ironic tagline in the history of media. Highly recommened.Have not seen ""Fox Attacks! Edition""... but I'm sure it is up to the standards of the original movie.I also recommened this in its book form and ""Fair and Balanced My A$$."""
4,Rupert Murdoch = Adolf Hitler/Stalin/Saddam,"This film shows beyond a shadow of a doubt the corruption in the news media and how it is effecting our country. Ironically, I first heard about this movie ON the Fox News Channel! Of course they were trying to smear it, like all conservatives act, rather than giving an opposing viewpoint with evidence, but all it did for me was whet my appetite to see this film. Although this is somewhat preaching to the choir, it always helps to give people evidence of just how corrupt our country has become, and why we need a change in power. The sad thing is that most of hte people below the Bible belt rely on the Fox News Channel for info, and its just playing into the hands of the Bush administration. This is a sign that we need to change things. Good job."
1,A Propaganda Film.,"This film is just a left-wing propaganda film. If it was truly ""fair and balanced"", it would also delve into and expose the vast majority of news networks that have a liberal bias, such as CNN, CBS, ABC, etal. Surely there's much more evidence of liberal bias out there than conservative bias. Don't waste your time and money with this left-wing propaganda film. Beware of biased films claiming to uncover biased news."
1,Incomplete,"Of course we do know that Fox news isn't balanced, but that's normal. On the other side, why don't we make a movie about Turner and CNN?"
1,more propaganda to accompany Fahrenheit 9/11? by incee3,"These ooor people who are so agitated by Fox news and consider themselves ""media experts"" should just watch MSNBC,CNN and CNBC to view the bias they prefer. I say thank God for Rupert Murdoch and do not worry about the rest of us."
3,You have to be kidding!,"Fox News is biased? You don't say. Why make a documentary about it? Why not include every news agency? They are all biased. Truth be told . . . if you're liberal and enjoy a good thrashing of the other side, get this film. If you don't enjoy that type of entertainment, use your money on a more useful product (like the cancer patients of St. Jude's Childrens Hospital)."
3,not much different than just watching Fox News,"let me start by saying i'm not a fan of Fox's brand of ""news"";but as i watched this i was getting more and more angry. it wasa little tough to decide if that was because of what was onthe screen (O'Reilly, etc), or what i was seeing (a documentaryabout O'Reilly etc).i think the problem with this is that it is really just likewatching an evening of the Fox News network. there was toolittle actual commentary or opinion -- there was reaction towhat the excerpts were showing, but no real dissection ofthe tactics employedin the end, this comes over as a Fox style attack, that justhappened to be pointed at Foxi was expecting more; the 3 stars are because there were somepriceless clip"
3,"Good, Could of been much better","The Good - Clips of Fox news, O'reily and Friends breaking the hippocratic oath of journalism.The Bad - Too many long interviews with unknown people.The Ugly - The Editing is very low quality.Do not buy unless you hate fox already, Rent it first then decide."
1,You are going to believe what you want to believe...,Forget truth here - hard spin to the far left!Lift anything out of context and you can make it say anything you want.Pure drivel on the order of Fahrenheit 911...Only the gullible and truth-haters will appreciate.
1,Conservative Bashing + Election Year = Greedy Author,Mr. Greenwald joins the ranks of those 'trying' to insult the intelligence of 'common' people.
1,PURE EDITING FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES,"This film is NOTHING but editing, it plays HALF of scene's from Fox Shows, and COMPLETELY EDITS out half the entire clip, to try and show only what the DIRECTOR wants you to see, not the whole scense. It CUTS OFF (nterviews, HALF WAY, and doesn't show the other half, which makes it make sense, what a Propoganda waste of a film. No need to write a review, cause this film will never be taken seriously."
1,Far from Fair and Balanced,"I find the 5 star reviews astonishing.I found this to be a biased, carefully edited election year attempt to discredit the leading, some what conservative news network.Hollywood is desperate to discredit anything that doesn't follow the liberal mindset.If you watch this film remember it is biased and question what you see, as you should any where.I'm sorry I wasted my time."
1,LIBERAL JUNK!!!,"Liberal junk. FOX NEWS CHANNEL is the only news network that dares to tell the true story. Fair and Balanced is 100% correct. CNN, ABCNEWS, MSNBC are all liberal based news. They all have an ANTI-Bush agenda. If Adolf Hitler were running for persident on the Democratic ticket the fools would vote for him. Gore lost, get over it. If ignorance is bliss Democrats are just plain giddy. This DVD is nothing more than propaganda. Too bad you cannot teach common sense. On the same note - Michael Moore hates America!!!"
5,Ignore the Right-Wing Nut Job Comments,I've been employed by Fox as an analyst. Trust me- they're biased. This film exposes it in a way that you really can't question. The facts are the facts: the network makes no effort to present the news in a remotely professional fashion. That's why I stopped working for them. You don't have to be a lefty to realize this. Even moderates like myself know bad journalism when we see it- and Fox is journalism at its worst.
4,Pretty darn good,"Pretty good doc, they do a great job of using Fox footage to get their point across. Frank Capra did the same thing during WWII when he used the Nazi's own films agaist them. The film makers definatly have an agenda, but seem to be on target with every film. I like the point that American's think goverment propganda is something that goes on in communist China, not here. If there ever was a case for someone's conspiracy theory views to actually make sense, this is it."
5,Let the video tell the story,"Fox News promotes itself as fair and balanced, when what it is biased and unbalanced. This DVD provides mountains of evidence in the form of video segments that contradict official statements that the network is unbiased and even handed.Particularly galling is the Jeremy Glick segment, presented in its entirety here. O'Reilly puts words in Glick's mouth, and later segments is seen claiming that his own lies about Glick are Glick's actual sentiments. This is reprehensible.It's an unflinching depiction of the Republican Party's mouthpiece."
4,happily signed the petition!,"I went to a standing room only viewing of Outfoxed last night and loved it! To be honest it didn't give me a lot of information that I didn't already know since I am an avid news reader of many sources. What I really enjoyed were all the great media analysts that were sourced, the interview with Walter Cronkite and Al Franken. I found the whole experience worth every minute of my time and gladly signed the moveon.org petition for Fox to remove the ""Fair and Balanced"" from thier reporting. I would encourage anyone who wants to have a sense of community and thoughtful discussion to go to moveon.org and look for a house party to view this work, if there isn't one in your area, spend the 10 bucks to buy it and offer your house or coordinate some sort of center for a viewing in your community though moveon.org. The whole experience coupled with my loathing of our commander in chief has made me want to really get involved in this campaign."
1,From MOVEON.ORG. Need I say more??,"It's amazing ... after nearly fifty years of having the liberal agenda dominating the news, a television network comes along and - gasp - decides to tell both sides of a story and becomes a smash hit.What happens? The establishment immediately puts out junk like this. First off, the some of the supposed ""whistle blowers"" in the film have never worked for FNC. Others were terminated because they simply weren't up to snuff. These are some facts that this film conveniently forgets about ... or maybe they simply don't care about the facts here.(...)"
1,Pure Leftist/Liberal Propaganda!,"Given the flood of insider books, interviews, whistle blowers and even a recent PEW poll that clearly identifies the overwhelming liberal bias (and propaganda) of most major media outlets it's not surprising that not only is FOX the #1 choice of most americans nowadays for it's frank reporting but now it comes under attack from those who prefer their news ""their way or no way!""It is the success of FOX that frightens these liberals the most as it interferes with their brainwashing! Truth and facts have always been something they fear!If I want frankness, tough questions, and the unslanted truth I watch FOX.If I want propaganda I watch the others."
1,Oh Please,99% of the media is left-biased. Fox is the 1% that isn't. Let's all get real and make up our own minds.
4,Elightening and Sickening at the same time! FOX = BAD,This is not the most exciting or entertaining documentary ever but it certainly is timely and informative. I've learned Bill O'Reilly is a complete pig and the whole Fox News Network is a right wing political machine...not at all fair or balanced. This film needs to be seen and discussed out loud. When did news become biased entertainment for the lowest common denominator. This is powerful and sickening stuff!
4,"Right or Left, We Need News, Not Dogma","Outfoxed shows how Fox News is not a news channel. It builds a case that FNC is not even a conservative commentary station, but instead a mouthpiece for the Republican party.So many of the reviewers here give Outfoxed thumbs up or down based on their politics . Anyone wanting open, fair political discussion and an informed electorate should be offended by manipulations such as those exercised at FNC. Outfoxed is a compelling call to return to objective news, something we should all endorse."
1,What a waste of time,"I think the director of this DVD must misunderstand FOX's slogan... ""Fair and Balanced""........... what Fox means is they are the one news network that makes things ""fair and balanced"" by trying to offset the far left leaning of vistually every other news source out there.... NBC, ABC, CBS, MSNBS, CNN, TNT, etc..If ""slanted news"" is REALLY his concern, why pick on FOX for leaning to the right ?Why not go after EVERY OTHER News Channel that leans to the left....WAY TO THE LEFT !!The reason of course is he has an agenda..DUH"
1,527 movie sponsered by MoveOn.Org,"If MoveOn.Org has this right, then so do the 250 veterans who served their country in Vietnam. Oops, this logic only holds weight with those who CAN think logically. I guess that's the real reason most extreme liberals hate Fox - it leaves them in the dust intellectually or they just can't stand to hear the other guy's viewpoint get a fair shake."
1,It's About Time someone is Fair and Balanced,I get a big kick out of watching liberals panic in the faceof the truth. And this biased and inaccurate movie demonstratesthat to the fullest. For decades we have had no choice beingspoon fed a liberal point of view on the network newscasts andthen CNN. It finally took a true pioneer in Rupert Murdochto bring us a Fair and Balanced view of the news and all thatwhining by the other news networks and ex-Fox employees isnothing more than jealously and bitterness at a news organization that is Number One in cable news.Murdoch definitely Outfoxed the liberal elite.
2,FOX's bias must just be more entertaining than others,"This film is well put together, thus the second star. Fox news has officially been exposed to be almost as biased in favor of the right as the other networks offered with or without cable and countless filmmakers are to the left. As biased as they may be, they are still incredibly outnumbered and manage to do very well. Let's face it, this ""documentary"" or whatever you want to call it is simply made and adored by the same people who would put you in jail for saying CHRISTmas instead of ""happy holidays"". If you enjoy child-like persecution masked by carefully selected video clips this is right up your....."
4,Fox Has Truly Been OutFoxed,"The video is a serious effort to expose the reality that Fox News is the American Pravda. Conservatives will cringe at the notion but facts are facts. Although the video clearly has a viewpoint, it presents its viewpoint through the firsthand expierences and knowledge of former Fox producers and other employees.The video is important because we are entering an era where both ""wings"" - right or left - seek ""news"" presented from an opinion based or philosophy based perspective. True journalism - the doman of the traditional skeptic - is shunned in favor of validating a partisan viewpoint. Fox set the trend. The others are following."
2,Fox Is Like Any Other Cable News Channel,"Fox news is no different from any other cable news channel; it sucks! Sure, it has a right-wing tilt, but as a conservative I'm not impressed. Like any TV news station, network, cable, or otherwise, it resorts to shock journalism and tabloid sensationalizing.I found Fox News offensive long before I detected any bias; it's loud, noisy, and obnoxious. And they aren't any good at their bias. Their lineup is full of conservative lightweights like Sean Hannity. I miss the good old days of Crossfire on CNN when Pat Buchannan had it out with Micheal Kingsly. Sure, they were two extremeists, but at least they were smart.OUTFOXED seems more obsessed with coroporate control of the news, intstead of the overall dumbing down of it.It's sad to see our country looking to ANY TV NEWS for their information. Take some time and READ FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!"
1,Worst camera ever,"I have a Dimage Xt as does about 5 other people I know. We all love them. So, I recommended the X31 to a friend. That was the biggest mistake I have ever made.The X31 is a piece of trash. It is unable to take focussed pictures inside a dimly lit bar. My Xt had no problems taking pictures in the same situation.If you want a camera that takes pictures in focus, you should avoid the X31."
2,Save your money,"I was hoping that when I pay a good amount of money for a product from a well known company which has a reputation in photgraphy, i'll get a camera that can take pictures. With the x31 that is hardly the case since the camera doesn't know how to focus. If you plan on taking pictures anywhere other than under glaring lights or the midday sun, buy another camera because the camera will just get confused and give you that little red dot telling you it can't focus."
5,Quite a Bargain,"The Seller was courteous and prompt. This little camera is amazing, I have one already that I paid over $175 for and I wanted a spare as they no longer make this model and I love it. It zooms in to take detailed close-ups, and takes great portraits and landscapes too. The slightly used one I purchased here was exactly as described and works perfectly."
3,Not usable in dark places!,"The camera is easy to handle and therefore for people who just wanna make pictures. The camera needs some seconds to focus the object which makes snapshot almost impossible. It is really convenient because of its size and the inbuild lences. The camera is really good for daylight use, but if it gets darker outside or even inside you can not use the camera at all. The flash, needed to focus on something, is to weak."
1,Average Book but Coan's Attack on Chapin's Family Are Sorry,"Coan did a mediocre job writing the book. Provides some insight in Harry's life. The book might have even gone over well if Coan did not constantly slam Harry's widow Sandi at every opportunity in the prologue and epilogue. His actions showed NO CLASS which Harry had a lot of. I imagine Harry Chapin would roll over in his grave if he saw it. If he had problems with Sandi, he should have left them unspoken. I do not recommend wasting your money on this book. I sure wish I had my money back."
1,Coan's writing style and self-absorbed attitude does not do his subject justice,"An accurate sub-title to this book might be: ""How I screwed Sandy Chapin"", as the author continually makes disparaging remarks about her. There's an irony in this author fairly gloating over the fact that he won a lawsuit against her for attempting to halt the publication of this book and then, as he mentions the lawsuit she won against the trucking company who's vehicle stuck Harry's car, suggests that she donate some of the funds to WHY-because ""They could use the money"".Whatever bug Coan has up his posterior gets in the way of his biography of a fascinating, insightful and very human man we knew. It's my hope that the family, who continues Harry's causes, will one day write a better biography than this."
4,RERELEASE/Reissue,"org is from Product DetailsAudio CD (October 6, 2001)Original Release Date: 2001Number of Discs: 1Label: Five Star"
5,One of the most amazing albums ever,"Sometimes time, space and people all converge to create something truly amazing. The Cowboy Junkies Trinity Sessions album is one of those.""Heavenly wine and roses, seem to whisper to me, when you call, when you call""Sure, Lou Reed wrote it. But nobody performs ""Sweet Jane"" better, ever has, or ever will."
5,A Hauntingly Beautiful Album,"The Cowboy Junkies are a great band and Margo Timmins has a beautiful voice. The Trinity Session is possibly their best album. It contains some really great cover songs, including Hank Williams' I'm So Lonesome I COuld Cry, Blue Moon and the best cover of the Velvet Underground's Sweet Jane. It also has some great originals, such as Misguided Angel and 200 More Miles, which shows the bands songwriting ability. All the songs are really good. This is just a great album and a great introduction to The Cowboy Junkies."
4,MELANCHOLY,"The CD is full of feeling and marvellous melodic lines. It has the perfect soundtrack for those Sunday nights after having a lot of fun during the daytime. You lay and put this music and then relax and go to sleep. But it is not for all tastes and for all times, as it is very melancholic, as Cowboy Junkies always sounds, but here even more. ""Blue Moon"", the famous song, is the highlight here."
5,UNIQUE ATMOSPHERIC SOUND,"This elegant, spooky and emotionally gripping music can loosely be placed in the same category as Daniel Lanois' masterpiece Acadie and perhaps be described as folk or country based atmospheric rock. There is an understated elegiac tone throughout, especially in songs like Misguided Angel, 200 More Miles, Dreaming My Dreams and the exquisitely sorrowful To Love Is To Bury. They turn Lou Reed's nervous, pulsating Sweet Jane into a dreamy folk song and the traditional Mining For Gold into a spiritual anthem. Their own compositions like the aforementioned Misguided Angel, To Love Is To Bury and 200 Miles are as good as the well chosen classics that they interpret with such brilliance. I'm not familiar with their other work, but albums like this don't come around very often. It was recorded in a church in Toronto which probably explains the unusual overall sound. A classic if ever there was one."
5,Sophmoric? I think not....,"Trinity sessions, released in 1988, followed the Cowboy Junkies first album, ""White Off Earth Now."" This is one of those few albums that now matter how I try, I cannot find the words to describe it. Right up front the listener is confronted with Margo Timmons' voice on a traditional piece called ""Mining for Gold,"" and from there it only gets better. ""Misguided Angel,""""200 More Miles,"" and Hank Williams' ""So Lonesome I Could Cry"" are only a few of the highlight of this album.... And there are no low points... none at all. Margo Timmons is one of those rare gifts given to humanity. Her voice cuts like the sharpest of knives, and soothes like the coolest of salves. Micheal Timmons plays the guitar not with virtuosity and technical ability, but more like a master sculpter who wields his hammer and chisel, knowing precisely when to strike hard or gently.You gotta hear this one."
5,Beautiful and Original!!!,"The Trinity Session is a CD you must buy!! The songs are enchanting and the lyrics are full of meaning. It is an unusual style, but it is a great break from the usual sounds of songs today. I especially like the songs ""sweet jane"" and ""misguided angel"". The songs are sung with feeling and they are so beautiful. I can listen to this CD again and again and never get bored."
3,Uneven mix,The vocals are totally drowned out by the instruments - especially on To Love is To Bury.
5,Simply awesome easy listening,"Put simply, this album is a no-brainer for those who like relaxing, easy on the ear, calming, enjoyable, (and extremely well produced) music. I only recieved it a few days ago, and have listened to it each night I got home (and hummed bits at work).I have just discovered this band, and this album (courtesy of amazon) and its only a matter of time before I start working through the rest of their back catalogue!"
5,Impressed!,"I bought this CD used because I liked ""Sweet Jane."" I heard it on the radio about 15 years or so ago, but was too [out of it] to get the name of the group. I recently heard the song again on a public radio station and ... I was in a better position to get the artist's name. I have never heard of the Cowboy Junkies and I'm not familiar with their other work, but this is a very good CD. The muscians take me back to the day's when country music was good and her vocal range is excellent. In fact, spooky! I'm not sure if country is the right category for this CD, but it's delightfully different!"
2,"Not their best, too lifeless, undynamic","Hipster favorite ""Sweet Jane"" cover is very good, the rest of the record a bit lifeless and undynamic. It's all in the same vein. Lugubrious mood throughout. Many love the recording and they should be credited for the attempt at a minimalist ambient sound. But there's a constant sibilance to her voice that annoys me and, again, I think the fragile set-up compelled the lack of dynamics. Some of the songs are suited to the sound, but not all of them. One Soul Now is an infinitely better album."
5,INDESCRIBABLY PLEASENT,"Singer Margo Timmons would seemingly be just as comfortable in a forties piano bar, as in a nineties shooting gallery (sorry. couldn't resist). Her melancholy vocals are haunting. The (usually) slow strum of the band generates alcohol induced dreams in those who listen up. If he played this at his place, I'd screw him'"
3,Honed aesthetics,"3 1/2Last chance for a slow dance. Soothing, and sad, these atmospheric tributes along with quite a few worthwhile covers were on par with the best slow-core could muster, the Junkies here especially sounding like some kind of countrified early Low. While the lyrics and mood may remain similarly down, the subtle life injected over evocative female breathy-ness is anything but. There is nothing too special about much songwriting in the originals, they simply emulate traditional forms far more sensitively in this taut session. It is amazing that this was recorded how it was, I supposed they had a sound and they knew what they were going for, and it still remains an amazing production technique, perhaps overshadowing much of the work itself."
3,Phosphagen HP,"Phosphagen HP is a very good choice if you are searching for a creatine based product.I've used generic type micronized creatine as well as several other brand names. It's easy to get ripped off buying into all the marketing about creatine products having ""something extra"".Sometimes there is a better formulation, but in my opinion they haven't improved too much over some of the original creatine formulas such as Phosphagen HP.If you are looking for a quality product for a reasonable price, this one is a very good choice."
3,its good i think...,"Well creatine is creatine.. except this one theoretically helps shuttle more creatine into your muscles with the carb rush (insulin).. sounds great.. it does make you bulkier quick, so you better want to be bulky if you take this.. and you do feel about a 5 to 10% increase in energy when working out I'd say.. its good, it sounds good, mostly its the placebo effect I think when it comes to the energy.. so its a neutral to good supplement, but I don't see why you shouldn't buy it..."
1,No expiration date,"The item itself is great but I would suggest ordering from fitrx or muscledepot instead. On the original order I received the item with the entire label missing so I sent it back requesting they send the item in it's correct packaging. The replacement was received with the label but the ""best if used by"" date looks as if it has been mysteriously erased."
5,New wave returns!!!!,"This CD rocks with energy and attitude. I'm a big fan of early 80's new wave and punk, and this CD has hints of my favorite bands from that era - The Police, Blondie, Go Go's, the Clash, the Pretenders... great playing, great singing, and fun, in-your-face pop songs that got me singing along after one listen. This CD absolutely ROCKS!"
3,Quite Expensive for What It Is,The idea of math practice with the wheel is good. The portability is good because you can take a few wheels with you in case there is something specific to practice. As far as durabilty it is thin cardboard so it all depends on how much care you take. I think the price is expensive for what it is. I paid almost thirteen dollars and yes even though it is a wheel it still serves more or less the same as flashcards which are 1/4 the price. I wouldn't recommend this product simply for the price factor. For that price you can buy some cubes and rods and teach hands on math.
1,What is this C R A P?,"All I want to know is, where the heck is Sisters Of Mercy Hold No Pain Against The Dark Lord, with their song, ""Silk Blood on the Footsteps of My Mind - Revisited""?"
2,Weird Method,So you watch this guy - Ernest Solivan explain how the brain works and he uses his terms. And then his method for opening mental blockages is to touch your thumb and finger together and say relax. After telling your sub conscious and conscious to work it out. And then he's up there testing how hard he can push down on your arm and touching your right side of your head or the left to tell if one side of the brain is off. I don't beleive this works. The cost is not worth what you get. Not much. I recommend Joel Osteen or Glenn Harrold for changing the way you think is a much better investment. PS. Ernest's friends must have wrote the good reviews. I give it two stars because the explanation of how the brain works and fails sounded interesting.
2,Missing Too Much to Be Really Useful,"This is largely a collection of URL links. The author is inconsistent in explaining what is available at each site. Sometimes there is a lot of explanation and at other times none. Putting the term ""spinal stenosis"" in Google, Yahoo! or other widely used search engines can lead to equal, if not better results.The other content of the book is limited in explaining the condition of spinal stenosis or the diagnostic tools and treatments commonly available. Many critical terms are omitted from the glossary and the arrangement of information can be very confusing to someone new to the topic.I was deeply disappointed in this purchase."
1,what a rip!,"The is downloaded copy of the NIAM website, and a list other research websites. I learned more from Google."
1,Defective disk,Defective disk (not the first one from Bill Knell). Promised refund - never received it. Not recommended.
4,DANNER 9.5 MAG DRIVE PUMP,"I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL DANNER PUMPS INCLUDING THREE OR FOUR OF THIS MODEL OVER THE 25 YEARS SINCE I BUILT A KOI/ WATERLILY POND. THEY FUNCTION WELL BUT EVENTUALLY WEAR OUT. WHAT GOES IS THE IMPELLER NEEDING TO BE REPLACED AND EVENTUALLY THE ROUND HOLE IN THE BODY WHERE THE IMPELLER DWELLS BECOMES WORN, OUT OF ROUND AND WITH GROOVES WORN INTO IT THAT THE PUMP BECOMES NON-FUNCTIONAL. THEN IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I MAKE A POINT OF CLEANING THE INPUT WEEKLY AND KEEP THE PUMP OFF THE FLOOR OF THE POND TO LIMIT PICKING UP DEBRIS. THEY ARE GENERALLY STURDY, WELL FUNCTIONING PUMPS."
5,The last... and one of the best,"Many other people have sung the praises of this fine album. I'll just add a couple of things. :) One thing (and I know it's the wildest of pipe-dreams) is that I would love for someone to reissue this CD with the cover art Jim FitzPatrick painted for it. Despite the fact that, IMO, the art was some of the best Jim ever did for Lizzy, the record company decided to go with something more ""modern"" and ""metal"". From what I understand, Phil Lynnot was NOT pleased with that decision. One other factoid, for those who give a damn: ""Dimebag"" Darrell Abbott once listed ""Cold Sweat"" as among his top ten favorite songs.It is such a CRIME that this was the last Thin Lizzy album. I just watched the ""Live and Dangerous"" DVD on the 4th, 22 years after Phil's death. What a great band.Rest in peace, Philo."
4,Lizzy's Last Stand...,"Everything that made Thin Lizzy the great rock band it was is in this album...the great lead harmonies, excellent song writing, great performance, and dead on guitar leads from some of the best players of their time. There is some over the top 80's metal production that makes the album more of a ""glam"" piece than it should have been but don't let that fool you...it's a rock and roll album from start to finish. It opens with the hard hittin' title track and doesn't let up until the closing chords of ""Heart Attack"". The songs show what Phil Lynott was all about...writing songs with great melody, harmony, and strong back beat. Just take time to listen to ""Holy War"", ""Baby Please Don't Go"", or ""Bad Habits"" and you'll get it."
3,Cold Sweat Burns,"This is a must have for aspiring rock guitarists.Play the opening riff to ""Cold Sweat"" thru a good amp at HIGH volume and you just might meet God. Fans of the more commercial ""Jailbreak"" era (which also produced excellent music) may be slightly disconcerted by the harder rock leanings of new guitarist John Sykes - who revitalized David Coverdale's career a few years later on the ""Whitesnake"" album - Be not afraid! This is Phil Lynotts' Thin Lizzy at its best! For some reason best left to politicians and record company execs, ""Thunder & Lightning"" is not available as a CD in the US. To get your hands on a copy of this essential Thin Lizzy, you must needs buy an import version at a substantial cost increase. Thus, 3 stars."
3,essential lizzy,The sound quality on this wounded bird CD is awful. Even using EQ adjustments its awful. I consider it the worst sounding CD of any I purchased over last 10 years. I only give it three stars because its a dirty jewel in the thin lizzy collection.
2,Weak...,"Frankly, I'm shocked by all of the praise this album has received on this site. This is basically 80's schlock-hair metal with no hint of the Thin Lizzy that reigned supreme in the mid-seventies. Lynott sounds tired; probably wasted. I cringed during most of the tunes, excepting the decent ""Sun Goes Down"". Everything else sounds derivitive, forced, and just plain boring..."
2,"Seek the Original ""Man Plus""!!!","Not particularly interesting nor intriging. Just when the plot began to go somewhere, I ran out of pages. Not particularly bad, but if you are a Sci-Fi fan, and are intrigued by the character of Roger Torraway (as I am) then seek the prequel titled ""Man Plus""."
3,INTERNET GROWS A FACE,"This book is an oldie but it's amazing how man continues to plod on toward a Martian landing as did the characters in this story. I kept wondering for 17 chapters who the narrator,""We,"" was who told the story? In a cutesie, laconic way this question was sort of answered in Chapt 18, the four page ending. I won't, but I don't think it would spoil anything by revealing the ending, in fact, not knowing the ""We"" identity sort of spoiled the book for me. I like to know who is telling me a story. Still, much was attempted for the 1970's so I will only spank the author with the brevity of this review."
3,Good Story Exotic Background,"Kelly Ryan is a transplanted Chicagoan living on an island in the Caribbean. She runs the island's radio station and has the annual island birthday parade dumped on her. It doesn't help, that her boyfriend dumps her and her ex-husband is getting married again. A tourist with a know it all attitude ends up getting murdered and Kelly finds herself trying to find out who did it.I enjoyed this book. It makes a wonderful beach book, and the author has left plenty of plot lines dangling for sequels."
1,Horrible! Hopelessly contrived attempt at humor; very boring,"What a waste! The author tried hard to be funny, but fell far short of the mark. It was ridiculously unfunny, a very dull mystery. It might (might!) have been okay if the author hadn't tried so hard to make every paragraph witty, but it was a complete and total waste of both time and money."
3,There is a reason the second recording was never released,"While the music that we know from the first album is a 5 star record for that moment in time, the unreleased songs at the end of the CD which were to have been on the follow-up album are just awful. It's amazing how a band can be so good for one album and show so little on the next."
3,D-Nice can get the party startin,"D-Nice does have the hype and the energy to get the party startin and this album does showcase his ability to move a crowd...not all rap that you can classify, but ok."
1,Not enough information,"This book doesn't give you enough information to defeat certain bosses, it gives you inaccurate or wrong information. The item guide is too small and hard to find. It should include a full map of the world."
3,the unoffical work of Mark MacDonald and James Hogwood,"I enjoyed the Final Fantasy VII: survival guide because of its details and writting format. It gives a great walkthrough of the game in a reader-friendly format. The illustations in this book let you see perfectly what the writters are talking about. Without a walkthrough of any role-playing game, you are bound to overlook several items throughout the game. This walkthrough is a perfect book to read if you want to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of the wonderful game. While this book is not as well written as the offical walkthrough, it is a great, less expensive substitute."
4,Hey It didn't tell me how to defeat Ruby Weapon..,"This is a good step by step guide to defeat Final Fantasy VII. Well, the game is so linear and there is no plot twist in this game.. However, in order to survive, you have to collect various type of material orbs. You can follow the guide book and save your time searching for all the material orbs. FF VII fanatics know that the ultimate challenge is to defeat Ruby Weapon.. This book doesn't give any hints on defeating this monster..."
5,Myoplex Ice cream,"I stopped drinking these after getting tired of them long ago. I just remembered about my half-full box of packets and mixed them in a Vitamix with just water, not so great (very foamy). The next day I tried blending a packet with lots of ice, a little cold water and frozen fruit --Make sure you use the tamper as it turns out very thick-- Wow! It turned from hard to eat to ""I can't wait to eat this after my workout."" I highly recommend any of you with a high-powered blender to try this. It makes two giant bowls with all that ice and fruit so you can eat it all or save some for later (If frozen overnight nuke it on fairly low power for a minute and it should stay ice-cream like.) Also I don't know if it is a coincidence but I think having one of these a day is helping my weight loss/muscle gain (combined with intense exercise) and it helps me feel full for several hours and also avoid sweets."
4,Myoplex creamy chocolate shakes are good,"They are creamy, chocolatty (as advertised) BUT to be truly tasty, you have to add stuff such as a banana and/or frozen chocolate yoghurt or ice cream. This is why I only give them 4 stars."
4,Great Tasting Shake,"Took a chance and ordered this protein shake and was not disappointed. Rich chocolate taste. Mixed in a blender with a banana, milk and ice cubes it makes a great tasting shake. Have one after my morning workout and it's all I need for breakfast. Not disappointed and would order again."
1,Chalky,This mix was chalky and more like ovaltine than chocolate flavor. Returned and doing more research n high protein mixes.
1,Disgusting,Stick to the pre-made shakes. This powder is difficult to get down. Doesn't taste anything like the chocolate shakes. Avoid this stuff.
4,Um yeah.,"I don't know exactly what people expect to get out a review for a protein shake? It makes me feel better after drinking it, but that could be psychosomatic. It costs a bunch, but it comes in nice packets, which specify servings and nutrition information. You could probably achieve the same thing with one of those big buckets of questionable off-white powder, but then you don't get the impressive packaging and presentations. I mean, if the things is psychosomatic, then every little bit helps."
2,"Horrible ""diet"" taste","Nutritionally, Myoplex is pretty good. It has a good ratio of carbs to protein, it's low sugar, and contains some vitamins and minerals. However, the taste leaves a lot to be desired. Drinking this stuff mixed with water or milk is one of the most vile tasting concoctions I've ever tried. The taste is so cloyingly artificially sweet that it makes any diet soda seem appealing, and I hate diet soda. If there was ever such a thing as diet Yoo-Hoo, this is how I imagine it would taste. I need to throw in a few scoops of peanut butter, or chocolate powder, or yogurt, or whatever I can find in my cupboard to get this stuff to be anything close to palatable. I'm definitely going to try another brand as soon as I finish my remaining packets...or maybe before."
2,A waste of money,This album is only 20+ minutes long and doesn't start to cover the career of a truly great singer. Was he country or pop? Does it matter? The quality on this album is not great. Go for one of the longer and remastered releases.
2,"A vague, impressionistic bibliography.","The author provides no first-hand knowledge of his own, providing only second-hand synopses of the works of others.If you are willing to research further, this would seem to provide a ready-made outline. My interest in buying the book was for possible linguistic comparison, but the author only names a few native gods and gives very little in the native languages.The author prides himself in identifying his allegience to French methodology. Evidently this explains his negligent lack of maps, glossary, charts, or any detailed descriptions of concrete facts."
1,"Order paid for, and never Received!","I ordered this book on October 24, 2010. Today is December 26. It is now two months later, and I have not received the book! The vendor has received payment on October 26, 2010. I am not happy!"
3,Chris de Burgh is workin' on his timin' sharply!,"Well, at first I didn't liked his new album that much... as it's a little modern, but later on.. after listennin' to it again and again, I gotta say it's a great one, specially the LEBANESE NIGHT, duet with Elissa.."
4,De Burgh keeps it fresh after 27 years,"You would think that after 25+ years in the music business, having amassed a personal fortune estimated at nearly $50 million, Chris de Burgh might be ready to hang it all up and head to beach pictured on the cover of ""Timing is Everything"".Or, at the very least, you might think he'd simply throw together a few half-developed tracks and call it an album.Wrong on both counts.De Burgh is still in great voice throughout the 11 songs on ""Timing is Everything"", and his lyrics still have the ability to paint vivid pictures of love, war and compassion.The opening and closing tracks (""Guilty Secret"" and ""Save Me"", respectively) are the album's weakest. Not bad songs, necessarily, but they just lack the depth we have become accustomed to from De Burgh.The rest of the album is absolutely excellent."
3,Paradise Lost,"Looking at the cover of ""Timing Is Everything"" you'd think the music would be as refreshing. It is to an extent. De Burgh attempts to make an upbeat and exciting recording but it falls rather flat. De Burgh has created a cd with a slick production and nothing really memorable. This isn't ""Spanish Train & Other Stories"", ""The Getaway"" or ""Man On The Line"". There are no interesting stories here, just bland songs about infidelity and romance--a territory well worn on previous outings like ""Into The Light"", ""Flying Colours"", ""Power Of Ten"" and ""Quiet Revolution"". At times, I even felt that Chris sounded downright silly. The best that can be said about this cd is that it's mercifully short and upbeat."
5,Uplifting,A good book to bring you to grips upon receiving devastating news-word for thoughts were strong --recommend for anyone to read
5,Secrets from the Sisterhood of Breast Cancer Survivors,"This is a very good book. When you are going thru the Doctors appointments and treatment you need all the uplifting and support you can get rather it be by reading, friends and family. This book was one of the uplifting tools used."
1,Uplift (surprise!),I was surprised that this was not really a novel but a collection of comments by women who have survived breast cancer. Wonderful collection but certainly not worth $11.99 for my Kindle posing as a Barbara Delinsky novel!
3,BODY WRAP Women's LongLeg Panty High Waist High Waist,This item doen't slid down from the waist as other shapers do but it does not hold you in as well as other shapers I have tried. For the price I was very disapointed.
3,Thief that steals from a thief...,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie a few yrs back and It is excellent. The story is about a very attractive and smart bank robber that went through so much trouble to pull of the heist of his life only to be outsmarted by a beautiful insurance agent. The lady keeps stealing those diamonds and the gentleman keeps stealing them back. In the process, you get to watch some of the most ingenious disguises presented."
3,Poor Description,"First of all, the color is way off...it's actually a light grayish taupe. Based on the weight in the limited description it should be obvious that this is not STONE, but plastic. It comes in two pieces, you attach the urn to the base. Mine have a couple of small dents/imperfections, but for the price I'll keep them and face them the other way on my back patio. Not a quality looking planter, you'll need to drill drainage holes."
5,Truly enjoyable,"Stanley Stewart presents several stories from air incidents with a brilliantly narrative manner, keeping a fine balance between the technical and non-technical aspects of every case during each presentation.I truly enjoyed reading this book, and currently looking to order other titles by same author, simply because of the way he writes (which, to me, is compelling).Highly recommended."
4,Could not put it down,"Deals with the unexpected on the flight deck and how the pilots with quick thinking (sometimes outside the box) deal with unknown happenings. True, exciting stores that end well and in a way that a bit of a problem (not that one would not want that to happen) but it takes some of the suspence away. Thats why I give it 4 stars - probably should be 5 stars. Great book that inspires confidence in flight and the training the crews undergo."
3,Crisis on the Flight deck,This is a summary of various air incidents well recorded by others. I was expecting something with more depth on the relationships on the flight deck and traffic control and therefore somewhat disappointed.
4,works ok,"This thumb rest is okay, it fits some instruments better than others. If it doesn't fit well, it will rip."
3,Only get for small thumb rests.,"The thumb rest is ok. When you put it on the clarinet it is too small, but my thumb rest is big, so only get this if you have a small thumb rest. It took it a very long time to come, but overall the thumb rest is good."
3,Only get for small tumb rests.,"The thumb rest is ok. When you put it on the clarinet it is too small, but my thumb rest is big, so only get this if you have a small thumb rest. It took it a very long time to come, but overall the thumb rest is good."
3,"If you're interested in this book, you're already lost","I was interested in this book, my brother had it lying around. I read it (it's a series of vignettes about Mormonism with a lot of ""what ifs"" as their basis) and enjoyed it, but it didn't stop me from eventually following my logic and conscience and leaving the Church. Didn't hasten it either, for that matter.Just by picking this book up you've already shown that you disbelieve."
3,Nice Price!,"The Why We Fight series is a masterpiece, composed of many clips taken from the second world war. I plan to show this series to my class, and I know they will be entertained and educated. The price is great, but there is one problem there should be seven programs. Series titles should include: * Prelude to War * The Nazis Strike * Divide & Conquer * Battle of Britain * Battle of Russia Part 1 & 2 * Battle of China * War Comes to America. To get four for 9.99 is a steal!"
3,ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS,"As a former chef-owner of a restaurant in my younger years, I was surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the Bookbinder's White Clam sauce wihtout doctoring. It is a great product for easy convenience."
4,Shapes Puzzle,"We have only the Shapes puzzle--purchased at a local ""maxximum"" discount store...if you get my meaning...This was my daughter's very first puzzle. The oversize wood knobs are perfect for litle hands! She quickly learned these three shapes (triangle, circle, square) as a result of this puzzle.We don't use puzzle pieces as teethers, but she has chewed on the pieces many times and no paint or clear finish is chipped off of any of the pieces.My only complaint about this puzzle is that the pictures underneath the pieces does not match the puzzle piece. For example, the triangle puzzle piece is supposed to cover up a piece of pepperoni pizza--this REALLY confused my daughter for quite awhile as she noticed the circles on the piece (ie the pepperoni pieces) rather than the overall triangular shape of the piece of pizza.Now that she is older (21 months) she is a pro at this puzzle and usually avoids it in favor of more challenging peg puzzles."
3,Nervous,"My nearly 1 year old son enjoys taking the puzzle pieces out of their allotted spaces and banging them together like a tambourine. However, since he is teething, everything ends up in his mouth. His little teeth are peeling the paint on the top of the puzzle pieces so I'm continually pulling pieces of paint out of his mouth. He's whittling those puzzle pieces down like a beaver and I get nervous a chunk of wood or paint will be swallowed. Probably being a paranoid first time father but still a little nerve wracking."
4,Excellent Printer if you need a Laser,"This refurbished printer is classic HP - works perfectly! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that because it's a jillion pounds, the seller packaged it safely in that foam packaging that conforms to the shape of your item, but during shipping the bag that contained the hardened foam slit open, and lots of the ""foam dust"" was down inside the printer...had to take it apart and blow it out with canned air. BUT - it's still a great printer, and the ""beginner cartridge"" is still printing beautifully after a year and a half, and i print out LOTS of legal and loan documents. GET THIS INSTEAD OF A NEW ONE!!!"
1,Unavailable,"All excited that I found it and was all set to order when I read the scripture ""This item is not available"".Real bummer"
5,Funny and Frightening,"If you've ever been confused,irritated,or just plain angry about the condition of today's medical system, you must read this book. Vick's witty prose lays bare the medical industry's laws, regulations, and profit-oriented structure to reveal how today's physicians must bob and weave in order to provide patients with the care they need. But even the best of those docs are becoming increasingly flogged by the system, and, as a result, many feel they have no choice but to leave their chosen profession.Vick's observations about ""alternative medicine"" scams and the overbearing influence of insurance companies is especially insightful.All this serious fodder is woven into an entertaining story that will keep you riveted. And what could be bad about a book set in Hawaii? It's paradise, after all. Oh - except for those pesky problems with the medical system.This is well worth the read."
4,Poisoned medicine,Vick perceives the irrational forces that are shaping modern medicine and conveys the tragic results with a sense of humor. Nothing else seems to have been effective in getting those who control medical economics to come to their senses. An entertaining story.
4,Good introduction to UK culture,"Although the book is aimed for academics of Cultural Studies, this great book would also serve as a good introduction to UK culture for anybody who is interested in understanding how culture plays an important role within the UK political situation which is now entering an era of big change. Gardiner provides thorough analysis on the cultural history of the UK using examples in linguistics, popular culture, literature and so on. Sometimes his examples lack relativism but this would indicate that more debate should be taking place on the subject Gardiner introduces."
1,"I usually buy based upon customer reviews, but...","this time I was burned! I could not believe how bad the vocals sounded to me, so I asked a friend to listen; her comments are too unkind to put into print. Suzanne's voice is far from ""smooth"" or ""sultry"" - it's grating and often sounds off key. The instrumental tracks are just a relief from listening to that voice... and while I do admit the pianist, Dave Hazeltine is wonderful, and the quartet equally in a groove, they are little compensation for the half of the cd that is unlistenable."
5,Brilliant.,"Over ten years on and this album is still as fresh as it was day one.Supergrass had a very headstrong, expressive first album. As a second album ""In It For The Money"" was a musical improvement, but lost some of the more earthy expression of teens finding their way in life, but it comes together as their most overall enjoyable album to date. Sure, they haven;t had a bad album yet, and they are all quite good, but ""Money"" peaked as an overall package. Afterwards they became, at times, wistfully plastic, creepy, obtuse and silly.I still love their recent albums, but wish they would release one every two years minimal."
5,Big Comfy Couch: Upside Down Clown (Vol. 5),Great seller and the DVD was exactly what was describe. The DVD arrived on time and in great shape would do business with this seller again.
4,Good vaporizer,"Great all around vaporizer but I wish there was a way to fill it with the top on so that it wouldn't overflow when you put the top blue vaporizer piece into the lower white tank. It does gurgle quite a bit but that seems to provide ""white noise"" for the baby to sleep to. Make sure to clean with vinegar as this improves performance quite a bit. Also the direction state not to add anything to the water like Vick's vaporizer ""mix"". I haven't but can't see how this would harm the unit...Maybe it removes the anti-bacteria coating. There should be a provision for this. They have a cup were the steam comes out but Vick's recommend not placing the mix in there so I dilute with water and place in there anyway. Seems to work fine that way."
2,**Shrugs**,"I think that Hobson's book is good in a way that it provides a counter-argument to Eurocentricism such as found in David Landes' the Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Beyond that, however, I find that Hobson is lacking in any real substance and rather chooses to bash Eurocentrist's arguments rather than making any of his own. He resorts to many of the same pitfalls that he sees in Eurocentric authors by presenting the East as the sole site of pre-1800 civilization. I understand that he is trying to undermine Eurocentric arguments, but by being so obviously one-sided he is defeating his own cause."
3,Pure polemic,"Reading this book is like walking in to the middle of a unpleasant divorce argument or a trial where one lawyer is rebutting an argument that has already been made to the jury. If you are looking for an introduction to the topic of how the East and West interacted or influenced each other, this book will disappoint. Several alternatives are listed in other reviews.The author's decision to organize the book around a series of arguments he sought to defeat, his pedantic writing style, and the lack of balance in his language combine to make the book a difficult read. The term ""vainglorious"" is used so often to describe opposing views, that it deserves a long rest. Hobson cites an endless list of secondary resources of unknown quality which could interpreted as evidence of either thorough research or cherry picking; the book's lack of balance leads one to suspect the latter."
3,Prompt Shipping,"Prompt shipping; the copy I was promised was supposed to be new, but the copy I received was a used one. This copy had a lot of marking, notes on the margins."
1,simplistic,"This book is very disappointing and not up to the usual scholarly standards one associates with Cambridge University Press. The argument is a simplistic polemic (West bad, East good) that does not progress beyond the secondary sources that the author relies on. It cannot be compared to serious works of world history by Mcneill, Wallerstein, etc."
1,Save your Money,"50"" wing span my hind end. Don't waste your money. Go to Wal-Mart or Target. This product was cheap and not at all what I ordered. Where did it say in the product discription that I would get a 22 inch kite with rainbow colors? No where that is where. Second purchase that I hate."
4,Beautiful quality,"The box is very beautiful, wife loves it and there is lots of space for her massive collection of silverware."
1,Just awful,"This software is awful. Yes, it does everything the advertisement says, but that's it. No background options, the help menu is very basic, no design tutorials to get you started. Very basic program, I'm very disappointed."
2,Not the same as the original,"I bought this CD thinking it was that same as my record. The cover is deceiving; it has the same cover but three tracks are missing. What a disappointment especially since ""Let's Take the Long Way Around the World"" is not included. Only 9 tracks included not the original 12. I felt slightly ripped off."
1,Did not buy it from Amazon,I didn't buy the Cassette tape from Amazon I bought it new back in 1980 on Cassette and know own both the Cassette and the cd version and may I add the Cassette (believe it or not) sound way better than the cd and like the other person said it has more tracks on it than the cd does cause I looked at the cassette and both the LP and the Cassette have the track listings in order match up just perfect. I recommend getting the Cassette version now people say Cassettes wear out easy but thats not so it how you take care of them sure if you don't take care of them and don't keep them in their cases and some other things they after a while will not play good but if you take care of them keep them in a case don't leave it lying around in the open or beat and bang on it or take the film out because if you do that they won't play worth a damn.
3,Not so bad...,"...but not so good, either. Bessmertnova was 49 going on 60 in this. She looks older than Juliet's mother! But it doesn't matter as there is little attempt to portray her as a young girl. In this production there are no sets, no scenery, little pantomime and almost no attempt to tell the story. It is a dance version rather than a dramatic version. I tried to appreciate it as such, enjoying the dance, not worrying much about the story. But so much of the dance is trite, hackneyed, overdone and unimaginative! Grigorovich has recycled much of his own choreography from Spartacus and what worked then and there doesn't work here. There is much marching and goose stepping and old-style classical moves. In the scene where Juliet takes the sleeping draught, Grigorovich has choreographed Bessmertnova dying, or falling asleep as though she were Myrthe with the Willies from Giselle! Strange."
1,VC 1000W,This product was is not good at all. I used it for one day and smoke was coming out from it. I had to return it to amazon.
2,Fuses Constantly Breaking,"Using this item to power a 220 motor. After two full days of work with this motor, I have blown all the fuses.Instead of up-stepping motors, I am considering switching over all my 220 motor appliances to 110, as it seems that even a 1000 amp single socket step up cannot handle 220 motors.Maybe the item description could have mentioned that 220 motors will not work with this step-up, then I would not have bought this item, and would not give this 2 star review.Btw. where can I buy these fuses? Not locally in my area, just checked."
5,Great Product,"I am deployed in Iraq right now, and this product was given to me. I thought I would share that it is working wonderfully. I have plugged an array of 110v things into it and they work great. It is heavy, well built, and does its job. There is no noise to it whatsoever, except when you turn it on, but that's normal to ALL step converters. If you are looking for a good converter, consider this product."
2,Loud noise,"I am not clear about the internal mechanism of this box, it worked silently at the beginning but made loud noise when the output is larger than 500W, is it normal?"
4,Easy to use and did the intended job.,"I got the product on 06/15/2011. As far as packing of the product, it was very well packed with Styrofoam padding on the sides which covered the front and rear panel.Back Panel: It has four input voltage selections - 240v, 220v, 200v, 110v.Front panel: On/off switch with a light and sockets for 220v & 110v appliances which is clearly shown in the pic.It also came with two extra fuses.After 1st use, I'm pretty satisfied with the item. There was some smell, which I guess is from the transformer and I assume it'll go away after using few times."
2,not what i needed,"thought this could do a standard conversion from a US 220 down to 110, but only works to convert US to EU and visa versa"
3,"It's okay, not much information really.","I think this book is kind of thin. I read through it once and it is not a really good guide because the information is not really enough and some information is missing. In this book, they mainly just say how each team do in the upcoming season and some little hint for playing for each team. But overall, it is still okay to get this."
3,You get what you pay for,I purchased this items for my teenage daughter. I thought it would be nice to combine the MP3 player along with the flash drive that she needed for school. The display screen cracked within the first week. The device is larger that I thought it was going to be based on the pictures. With the rebates it was still a good price for the item.
3,"flaky power, trash manual, not really a value player","I bought this for my 12 year old son. He wanted a player and needed a USB drive, and I wasn't sure how much he'd use one. Consider it a decent starter player, with lots of features, but don't consider it a value even with a $25 rebate. I have never seen such a useless and poorly written manual in my lifetime of buying Japanese, then Korean or Chinese inept translations. It likes to power down if the battery is used at all. I paid $30 with rebates and feel like they did not go to enough trouble to take my money. Having said that, with a fresh battery and everything working, my son totally loves it."
4,Trailer wires,"Easy hook- up, good quality. I have to put extra words in this in order to submit a review....stupid requirements"
4,Easy install,"Everything went in just as in the instructions. The only problem I had was adding the ground wire. I don't know if Jeep frames are extra hard or what, but I broke off the self-tapping screw that came with the kit. Ended up having to drill and tap a new hole and use a machine screw. Kit could also use some foam tape to retape the connectors after adding them. I reused the Jeep tape for the two connectors, but now there are four to deal with. Kit also needs a bracket to hold the 4-pin connector. Apparently there are two different types and I am hoping to buy the right one."
3,"Great Activities, but loses stars for inaccuracy","This is a great idea, and my 6-year-old and I had a lot of fun doing the activities. The kit includes supplies for making some dinosaur ""fossils,"" a deck ""Dinosaur Snap"" cards (although we found they worked better for playing ""Concentration""), and the pieces to put together a T-Rex skeleton.My problem is with the accompanying book, which contains some inaccuracies - for example the statement that ""Scientists believe that crocodiles, sharks and even birds have come from dinosaurs."" Erm, no. Crocodiles and sharks were around before dinosaurs evolved. The book opens with the statement that dinosaurs are ""reptiles,"" which is no longer universally accepted. Especially since this book was published very recently (2004), it's very disappointing to find such stupid mistakes. When my six-year-old points out an error, that's very bad sign.So, I recommend the activities, but be aware that not everything the book says is true."
1,Couldn't be more disappointed,"Got this in 2009, used it twice, worked fine. Third time I tried to use it, the unit powered itself off when connected to the vehicle and the Enter key was pressed. Consistently, in more than one vehicle. Unfortunately took my time sending it in, warranty had lapsed, sent it to SPX service repair center as the manual specified, who prompty refused to fix it, even though I provided them all the out-of-warranty info they wanted. Their explanation was, apparently, at $76 per hour labor it just wasn't worth it. So now I have a bright orange $200 brick. Thanks, Actron."
3,Best scanner at a reasonable price,"This scanner (KIT) reads both OBD1 and OBD2 systems. It helps alot with troubleshooting emisions systems and controls. It also reads out data on systems with the engine running,O2 sensor, T.P.S.,coolant,rich or lean fuel injector setting and more. I think it is the best affordable scanner.The CP9150 is a CP9145 scan tool with the cables needed for OBD1 readouts"
1,Maybe I Missunderstood the Advertising?,"This product is advertised to enclude cables to read codes on, among others, 1989 to 95 Chrysler products. The cable to connect my 91 Eagle Talon is not only not included but the company has none and is not planning to get one. When I bought this 91 Talon (New) it was Advertised, sold, serviced by Chrysler and carried a 7 year ""Chrysler Bumper to Bumper Warrenty"". This is a Chrysler Product. The CP9150 is actually a CP9145 with extra cables and a case. (Not mentioned in advertising). When I inquired about getting a cable (not included) for my 91 Talon, I also asked why I could not read the fault codes on my 2000 Cadillac STS and 99 Chevy Conversion Van this is what I understood the Actron technicion to say: ""This unit is not capable of reading and will not read problem codes for ABS, Body, Drive Train, Transmission or Motor, only Gov. regulated emission codes."" I certainly got the wrong impression from their Ad. I sent it back."
5,CP9150,"Order was here FAST. I have played with scan tools from 1980 to date so know how they work. I got this 1 and in a few moments had used it on my Van (Dodge's) and Truck. I did see complaint's about what it WON""T do, and that it is a CP9145 in the case. Hey, read the add, its updated to CP9150, and not only for cables but programing. With OBD, it can work on about anything you connect it to. This is a great tool for not only DYI, but 1 that will work in a repair shop also. Like I said, I have only a few moments of use with it and for CEL problems, it was fast, and easy to use. Great tool, great price ..........."

5,"A vital, timely, level-headed financial preparedness book","In What If Boomers Can't Retire?: How To Build Real Security, Not Phantom Wealth, Thorton Parker draws upon his more than forty-five years of diverse experience and expertise in government and business management, strategic planing, finance and accounting, as well as policy development, to present the reader with a solidly written, informative and ""user friendly"" guide to protecting personal financial interests, including preparing for stock market downturns, scandals, and ultimately end up being able to enjoy a retirement that is not dependent upon social security. A vital, timely, and level-headed financial preparedness book, What If Boomers Can't Retire? is a ""must read"", not only for people of the Baby Boom generation, but for Gen-Xers and anyone else who must plan for their retirement despite the vagaries and volatilities of the stock and bond markets."
2,"One Great Thought, So Many Pages","Amazing concept and credible, but apparently wanted to lead us, as a Pied Piper to his world. I guess he's pretty smart, because he confused the heck out of me. An academic andeavour to fill a vitae. As a financial planner, I had to take seriously what he wrote concerning the largest demographic having to sell their stock. Left way too much out on solution, Way. Way, WAY too much on the political.Couldn't get a grip on who he was trying to reach."
3,A naive viewpoint,"Although I agree with the author's basic premise, that there will be too few prospective stock buyers when the boomers get ready to sell, no valid alternatives are offered. The author suggests that political and financial authorities should tell the truth so that remedies may be sought. But there are none! Obviously if any great number of investors stopped investing in the stock market or began drastic asset reallocation, the market would either crash or stagnate right away, and whatever value now exists would dissappear. There is no way to predict what the ultiimate level will be, so why precipitate it now? His suggestion of ""productive investment"" misses the requirement of liquidity. If the stock in a corporation is not traded, it is a very poor vehicle for retirement purposes unless it pays large dividends. He sounds like an ultraliberal greenie."
2,Mr.,"Hi,I got the CD and was very dissapointed. Shipment was just great, but the quality of CD was quite bad, Sound reminds the phone, like from the very old vynil record"
3,Unpleasant smell....,"I've been using this product for almost 2 weeks. Of course I have not seen any improvement yet, and will update later if there are any changes to my dark spot. However, this thing stink so badly. It smelled like cooking oil with onion or garlic. The first time I applied it on my face I almost gagged. Thought about not using it, but then I decided to give it a try. So i'm using this under my moisturizer that have a pleasant fragrance. I still can smell it, but it was a lot better. Wish they would do something about the terrible odor."
1,Waste of money,"I used this produce for almost 2 months, twice a day as instructed. I have a few small age spots. But this product has no effect so far."
2,Does not work,I've been using the product for a month and so far I haven't noticed a significant difference in the age spots on my face. I'm going to get a dermatologist opinion. I also may try the new Clinique or Garnier products on the market. I wouldn't recommend this product.
1,It smells,"I tried this as an easy way to remove some perma-freckles from my arms. OK, I slathered it on. And maybe I got a bad batch. But . . . the cream smelled really bad and the odor lingered for hours. After two days I threw it out and decided to look for some other product."
2,Disappointing solo debut.,"Moraz' performance on Yes' Relayer made clear that he was an exceptional keyboard talent. Unfortunately, this debut recording also exposes his weaknesses as a frontman and composer. The tunes are none too original, the vocals and lyrics mediocre at best and the arrangements rife with cliche's. Moraz and company overplay quite a bit which leaves the listener numb with boredom by the end of the disc. A shame really as he was quite a talent. Stick with Relayer avoid this solo effort (and it's follow-up Out In The Sun) like the plague...Simon"
2,Not engineered very well,"I like Moraz and this album a lot,however this particular album is really in need of a good remaster.There are passages when literally the drums go from up front and big ,to washed out and murky in the mix.Sounds like a very bad splice job at times.Great material,but just not presented very well."
4,I Revisited,"This was a standout from the first slew of Yes solo albums released. Patrick Moraz helped pioneer the world music genre. He has a good amount of Brasilian percussion and rhythms not heard this half of the globe since Sergio Mendes and Astrud Gilberto! John McBurnie and Viv McAuliffe (who I heard of through Anthony Phillips) providing vocals makes this more accessible to the mainstream. It's a long-running practise in prog and sometimes blues where it's one person's name on the front and someone else singing (like Rick Wakeman for starters!). Some of what we've heard on ""Relayer"" is here as well.Moraz says the album is really one piece, but he segmented it to make it more convenient. After this, he would leave Yes and have a solo career, as well as a stint in Moody Blues which ended in legal acrimony.Originally released 1976 by Atlantic Records in the US and Canada, and Charisma/Philips Records for the rest of the free world."
3,Marred by distortion,"The only thing this import seems to offer over the 1994 reissue is a more complete reproduction of the original cover art (albeit almost too tiny to read) and hotter output. Sadly, the output is a bit too hot, particularly in the piano solo in Impressions -- there is noticeable distortion on this version which is absent on the 1994 release. For that reason, I'd recommend the 1994 reissue over this one."
1,You're better off buying a used copy of the '89 release,"I read the original release of this book and enjoyed it very much. It was republished in 2006 and the changes included, though minor in terms of plot development, were offensive in terms of character development. That characters could be gay in the 80's and 15 years later be reduced to 'just good friends' is a sad commentary on the state of publushing in the US today."
4,Berry Review,I found this book to be both suspenseful and thought provoking. I read it in one evening. While being constantly entertaining it also deals with the serious issues that we all must at some time explore in our quest to understand the reasons people behave the way they do. I especially enjoyed how he deals with the question of communication between the dead and the living and the soul searching and ever conflicting subject of spirituality.The author has either done much research or learned a lot through life experiences and is knowledgeable of his subject matter. I am looking forward to his next publication.
4,Multi-level read,"Where to start? Yes, a page-turning suspense novel, but one that lingers over philosphies about life, about death and about those characters both human and inhumane. A complex work by a complex author. Worth reading on more than one level, or just for a heck of a good story."
5,Spinbrush Replacement Brush Heat,"Reasonably priced, variety of colors, quick shipment. I am very pleased with product and timely shipment of product."
2,brush replacement heads,"Turns out these brushes didn't fit my husband's toothbrush base, even though they seemed to be the right style, so they were useless to him."
4,good purchase,"I had searched in every store in our town, as well as in others in other cities and had had no luck in finding replacement brushes for my Crest Spin toothbrush. I had just about given up and was going to buy a new toothbrush. Then I thought of Amazon. I immediately found them online and ordered them. They arrived early and I have been very pleased. What a good find!!"
1,Poorly made,I purchased this for our blue road trip grill. It took a while but I finally got it to fit in the case. The first time I fastened the straps one pulled out of the seam. The grill was such a tight fit that I didn't think it would matter if it was not fastened. The first time we took our grill in the case tailgating the zipper started pulling out of the seam. I emailed Coleman but got no response. It's a great idea---too bad it is so poorly made. I feel like I wasted $46.00.
3,Carry Case,"My only complaint is that it could be 1-2"" longer as we fight to get the grill into the case everytime."
5,Great Case,"I bought this case and the red road trip grill together. The grill fits perfectly when the handle is removed. I also have two of the stove grate accessories, and the griddle accessory, and they all fit in the bag. That's including the two grill grates it comes with. I also have the propane adapter hose for the big tanks that fits into the case as well. I don't understand the reviews that say the grill doesn't fit. The case keeps everything together and is great for storage. We only use ours for camping, so it is stored half of the year. Great grill, great case."
2,doesn't fit the grill well,The case is too short in width to easily fit the grill. It is very tight and you have to work the grill down into the case slowly at each end. It will not rest at the bottom of the case but gets stuck halfway down so the cover is difficult to zip closed. We really need this case to work as we only use the grill away from home and transport it often. I assume there is no other alternative so we are using it the best we can. They should redesign it to fit properly.
3,"Great accessory, but doesn't fit the Roadtrip Pro","I bought this bag to go along with the Colemen Road Trip Pro Grill that I bought my boyfriend for Christmas. Unfortunately, the bag did not fit the model I bought, so I sold it to my dad who has a smaller model of the grill and he loves it. Perfect to throw in the car for tailgating!"
5,Great case!,"The case for the Road Trip grill is great. Much easier to transport, given the weight of the grill. The extra compartments are great for storing extra grill inserts. The only thing is that the grill does not sit up by itself in the bag; therefore, it must be laid down or leaned up against something. This is not a problem given that the ease of transporting is much more important!"
2,Be careful that your BBQ does not have the retractable legs,"There is nothing wrong with this item quality wise it just does not fit my Weber BBQ. I may very well fit if I just had the BBQ and no base. But I think almost all of these cookers are sold with the retractable legs, and this case will absolutely not fit if you have those. I think the same thing happened to the buyers that previously got my case as the box it came in was taped up so it was obviously sold before. I thought about taking off the base, but that is not a simple job and completely unpractical to take off the base, store, put base back on when you use it.If you only have the top part this case will be fine."
4,The first accessory you should get for your RoadTrip Grill!,"Why doesn't this just come with the grill? This case is a must have if you own the RoadTrip grill. You're going to get your grill dirty and this case keeps it all enclosed so there's nothing getting your car/truck dirty. They could have made it a little bit bigger, because it's pretty tight getting the grill in there. It has pockets to store the grates, but no place to put a propane tank or the regulator. But it's very well made and looks like it will last a long time."
1,DOES NOT FIT ALL ROAD TRIP GRILLS,"I found this wheeled carrying case to be useless for our Coleman Road Trip Grill. We purchased a new Coleman Road Trip Grill, Model No. 9941A (the Blue one) in July. Although the ads say that this carrying case with wheels works on all Coleman Road Trip Grill models, this is simply not true. We could not get the grill to fit in the case with the stand, let alone the two side tables and the tank. This carrying case must only fit the older grills that are red in color and have the older fold-up stand. Coleman was not helpful at all and it took two emails and several weeks before they even acknowledged my questions and concerns. I returned the carrying case as it is of no use to us if we can't get the grill in it. Don't waste your time if you have purchased the blue grill and think it will fit in this case."
2,cover wont fit with handle on grill,really.... grill wont fit with the handle on it. Poor design .... wouldn't have taken much more thought or design to make it really nice. Disappointed!!!
2,too small,"This product was very mis-leading!! It says it fits the Road Trip Grill LXE,But in fact it doesn't. Unless you take the wheels off, which is a pain in theA$$. Not a good product! Very dissappointed."
2,dont waste your money.....this bag sucks,I purchased this bag and was very impressed. The grill fit nicely and all the pockets through out the bag i though was really cool.. First time i took this bag out it worked out fine.. at home i notice the wheels broke off from the bag. I talked to serval people and they have had the same problem.. SO IF YOU BUY REMEMBER THE WHEELS WILL BRAKE OFF
4,Nice case,"Nice case overall. Easy to pack bbq and store or wheel around wherever you'd like. Had a little trouble fitting the handle of the grille so had to detach it and shove it on the side in order to close zipper. Otherwise, pleased with this product."
4,"Great, but with a few quirks","Coleman RoadTrip Wheeled Carry CaseI think this bag is amazing, but there are a couple design areas where I was at a loss until reading a few helpful reviews, where others before me gave excellent directions on getting the grill into the bag. By leaving the stand extended and shortening the leg, and then placing it in the bag and collapsing it, to fit almost perfectly.Coleman needs to put directions in and on the box.Another issue that I have and a few others also have, is the fact that one end of the bag will not zip around the chrome handle on the grill. I am thinking this might be a variance in sewing technique, making some bags slightly smaller. I cannot imagine another reason that it works for some and not others. I am not going to remove the handle on the grill. There's got to be a better way."
5,Great,The coleman road trip grill and accessories fit perfectly in the wheeled case. It is heavy so the handle and wheels make it a lot easier to transport the grill.
1,Coleman Road Trip Wheeled Carry Case does not fit grill,"The case it great, but it does not fit the Coleman Road Trip grill we have, handle sticks out the top and it is unable to zip. Very disappointed in Coleman and it's misleading advertisement for this case. Love the grill however! Next time, make the grill lock shut so you can roll it without the grates falling off, and make a case to fit it!"
1,Coleman Wheeled Carry Case,I am not impressed with this product. You must remove the handle of the BBQ or it won't fit into the cover. The tie down strap ripped apart on the first time I put the BBQ in the carrier. I wouldn't purchase this item again.
1,This does NOT fit all Road Trip Grills,The description clearly states that it fits all Coleman Road Trip grills. This is not the case as it was about 6 inches too short for mine. The good thing is that they paid for the return postage and issued a complete refund.
2,Returned,It does not fit the Coleman grill with the wheels and handle. You would need to remove wheels and handle in order to use. We returned this item.
3,road trip case,very tight fitting more room should be left for easy installation.a pocket for the regulator would be nice. will not stand up on wheels
3,Doesn't fit with handle.,"I have the RoadTrip LXX. You have to take the handle off and carry it separately. The zipper is difficult to get started and seems like it is not going to last. We'll see. You also have to remove the regulator attachment in order to fit it in the wheeled carrier. All this to say, I wouldn't buy it."
5,Handy Carry Case,"Bought this for my hubbys road trip grill. The grill fits really well and gives me a warm fuzzy knowing that any grease not cleaned will not end up where it should not (on the camper or the truck). It has handy wheels that make moving it around real easy, and getting it down from the pick up with the built in handles also makes things easier. The extra grates that we have bought for the grill fit in the pockets and storing the grill brush with the grill is another plus. It seems really well constructed and I expect will last us for years to come."
2,Why would they do that?,"The case is nice, but for the life of me, I can't understand why they would design it specifically for the Coleman roadtrip grill and then not allow enough space to zip it up with the grill handle attached. I like the protection it provides when stored in the RV, but I would think twice if I had it to do over again."
3,RoadTrip grill carry case,"Price was good, as was delivery. Case appears rugged. Storage for ""optional"" items like griddles not so great. Otherwise, nice case."
4,Great item!,"I purchased this bag to go with my new RoadTrip Grill. It's a must have for anyone who will be using the grill to travel with. This keeps the grill contained and protects it from getting scratched while traveling. I like the compartments in the bag, but decided not to use them for the grill plates...it's makes it too heavy for me to get the grill in and out of my van. I have a tote that I keep all of my camping supplies in so I just keep the grill grates in there. The wheeels makes it easy to move the bag around. I love this bag and I would have given it 5 stars, but I think that it's strange that I need to remove the handle from the grill to get it to fit in the bag. The bag should have been able to accomodate the folded grill as-is."
4,Sound Purchase,Case is sturdy and works well. Be sure to air out the case prior to storage if it will be indoors because the material it is made of has a strong odor. Otherwise it is a great carring case.
5,This is a brilliant book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book, and especially finding out all about the animals and about the different ways of life out in the heart of Africa. The whole Willard Price books are so good I am collecting them!"
3,Don't really know what to make of this one,"Hey, if you are like me, you have heard ""Gonna Find Me a Bluebird"" and you want more like that. Keep looking!Now don't get me wrong, I am sure longtime fans of Marvin will love this and won't want to miss what's here. But, I just needed some Marvin for my collection, and this was all that was available, so I got it, and still can't make heads or tails of what is here.The remastering if fantastic, and Bear Family does another awesome job with the booklet.To summarize: For long-time fans only!!!"
4,What a pleasant surprise!,"I am a huge fan of both Before Sunrise and Before Sunset (the sequel to Before Sunrise). I saw Before Sunset today in the theater and couldn't help but wonder if I would be able to find music like the song Julie Delpy sang towards the end of the movie. I loved the Nina Simone song as well but I absolutely loved and quite admired Julie Delpy and her singing. What a wonderful surprise to find out that she actually has her own cd out. It's very fresh, very relaxed and yet so feminine and well, ""french"". The reviewer that said her attitude comes out through her music is completely correct. Her songs are not classic works of art but they are very sweet, very calm and worth the 20 some odd bucks. This cd is probably not for everyone I'm sure but if you like French films, indie movies and jazzy waltzy type music, you'll love this cd."
4,It helps that shes a bombshell,Julie Delpy is amazing and her music is semi-hypnotic. I am easily dazzled by europeans and hints of accents. I dont think I would have liked the music as much if it didnt connect to the movie Before Sunset.
3,Advice re shopping for this CD,"I saved a couple of bucks by buying it on Amazon.UK from an American vendor. As for the CD itself, while I'm a fan of Delpy -- and it's very charming that she decided to release this amateurish and unpretentious album -- it's hard for me to get past the high notes she misses (in some instances she's a full step off). I don't understand why she didn't simply do more takes and get them right. I was also disappointed to find that only one song is en franais."
1,snails and liberty fries,"I don't really like this album but at least people react on it.It's hate or love nothing in between.I've only got to say that internet is not american and "".com"" doesn't mean US.If we french ,have got the choice of where we surf,it's only because we do speak more than one language (see Julie's album).Still if you like her so much,you can have her."
1,I've wasted my money,"I am from Belgium. I don't have much money and I love music. But I didn't think I was going to regret so much to have bought one CD. Truly, not only Miss Delpy cannot sing, but her lyrics are absolutely stupid and I feel that she is deeply frustrated. I should have thought better because I saw her guest appearance in E.R. last year and she was pathetic ! So is her album. Save money, don't buy it !"
2,I wanted to like it,"I like her as an actor. She is great on the screen. I think the best thing she did was Kieslowski's ""White."" But, sorry, she has no voice and these collection of songs are either very wierd or just boring. Too bad. Wish I could get my $25 ( ! )back. Its just not worth the money."
2,Not As Expected,"I ordered this CD because of the song ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life"" which I love. It was very good, but the rest of the CD was just not good enough for me to keep for just one song. I'm sorry to say that I returned the CD."
5,INTRODUCTION TO HOSPITALITY 4TH EDITION,It was my 1st experience purchasing books off of Amazon.This book has all the reading materials for my class. I couldn't believe the pricing for this book was so low. When my other classmates shared how much they paid( over $80). It was such a blessing to pay what I did. They have the 5th edition but the information is the same. I will shop more @ amazon.com for reading and other items.
3,"Disorganized, but never the less useful tips in the Book","The disorganization of this book is amazing considering that this is a Laura Lemay book. Do not buy this book if you wish to create enterprise solutions. The content of the book is more relevant for the mom-and-pop web site designer.However, what makes this book useful is that it contains a number of useful tips on the design issues and tools for a web page. Many better tools are now available than those mentioned in the book, but that is not Lemay et. al's fault. The design factor becomes important since now we are no longer concerned with learning HTML (the generators take care of that). If you are a mom-and-pop web site creator then you might find this book useful for the many useful tips.Sanjay Bapna http://jewel.morgan.edu/~sbapna/"
3,Lots of Tips,"Gosh! I found this book useful and am amazed at the flames of other readers. I found information here that none of the other (Que, Sams, Wrox, etc.) books had. For example: Mailto, Submit-it. In this it solved some problems for commercial pages I had developed that I could not (repeate could not) find in any other book (or even the news groups). The only reason I graded it down was due to the organization. There I do agree with the other readers. It would seem that this book was rushed out the door to print."
1,Piece of trash,"It wasted me 40 dollars to buy this useless piece of trash. Disorganized, never could follow examples ( exceptd you already know the stuff well, but then you don't need this trash). Don't buy!"
1,Can some one say crap?,Save your money for steroids. This book will make you angry at the fact that people try to pass of such crap for high prices.
3,chinese painting techniques,"lovely caligraphy, and good brush stroke explanation. I found it a bit shy on good explanations. I would recommend it for the Caligraphy portion of the book."
2,"Some good songs, pretty cruddy singing","Neal Morse for some reason sounds really good on the first section of ""All of the Above"" but is terrible on track 2 and other various songs on the CD. Everytime I hear him hit a bad note, it makes me wince. Same goes for Mike Portnoy. He is an excellent, innovative drummer, one that I look up to, but he goes a bit overboard with his singing, for his vocal abilities are very limited. Otherwise the musicianship is good quality. The cover of Genesis's ""Watcher of the Skies/Firth of Fifth"" was excellent, as well as the 30 minute epic, ""All of the Above."""
5,Its what makes a live album great and other thoughts,"The one thing I hate about many live albums is the inclusion of overdubs after the fact to correct the flubs. There are none of those on this album. Yes, TransAtlantic make a few gaffs, but that's part of the charm. I got this album soon after it was released and have enjoyed it ever since.Sadly, with the exception of the soon to be released DVD, there will be no more TransAtlantic. Neal's decision to persue other musical avenues has ended this great collaberation. Grab this collection, grab SMPT:e, grab Bridge Across Forever.The one thing you need to remember is that all of these albums were recorded over an incredibly brief period of time. SMPT:e was recorded in four separate studios with the players not really playing together until the Live in America shows. Bridge was recorded in a four days, with some tweaking after the fact.These three albums are a testament to the creativity and talent of these four musicians. Don't let them fade away."
4,Handy Chord Guide,"This deck (and others from the same manufacturer) is really handy because of the binding it uses. Each page/card is attached to a swivel allowing you to flip to the right chord quickly, while making sure the entire deck doesn't spill across the floor when you (or your cat) inevitably knocks it off the table/stand/etc.The easy-to-see diagrams provide a lot of detail considering it is designed to be a quick reference format.I would prefer having more chords at my fingertips but that's just me. There are electronic gadgets and computer software available if you crave something more comprehensive.This set covers the most commonly used chords and would be just fine for beginning to intermediate players."
3,"Missing some chords, awkward to use","Some basic important chords, B-7 for instance, are not included. Having the deck all attached is sometimes awkward when trying to display several cords at one time."
1,stereotypical xenophobic,"a film about a good ol indian village girl going to the US to marry an american of indian origin, a spoilt brat. The cliche and hyperbole are expected of a bollywood film, but the portrayal of american culture as materalistic, permissive and bad and indian as pure sita savitri is rather stupidly done."
3,I found mine for a lower price.,"I bought this at Walmart about 2 years ago..for $30.00 ...this price is a rip off. Overall, the only downs to this product are the limits of 6 conversations, and no backlighting. It's useless in the dark."
1,I Paid shipping costs for an item that did not work,Our ImFree did not work...so I sent it back. I was only refunded the purchase price...I was charged $7.99 for shipping to me...and then another $5.96 to ship it back...they did not refund my shipping costs....I spent $$13.95 for NOTHING!!! it did not work...it's not like I just wanted to return the product because I did not like it...it would not charge or turn on!!
1,Too Much Fluff,"Amherst Media publishes some great books. Their books are usually to the point and full of practical examples etc. This particular book it nothing like others that I have read. The author rambles on and on without getting to the point until the end of the chapter. The author goes on tangents, discussing topics like ""the percentage of people who can remember a punch-line to a joke"" (I am serious). There are some good tips but you must search through 90% of fluff to get to one or two good points."
4,"A great intro, or expansion of knowledge to the initiated.","From Auras to Astral Projection, this book covers much ground in very few pages. The depth of insight and thought put into this book stretches well beyond the page numbers. Written in an easy to understand, non master level language, the concepts are all presented clearly and expanded upon to great extent. ESP, precognition, and many other areas of Psychic study are discussed. Chapters have a small review area in which the main concepts are stressed. This book is worth it's cost, and is a must read for the entry level (very worthy of the read), or even the experienced occultist (Covers more ground than most other books - especially for the cost)."
3,Poor packaging of DVDs,Don't stack DVDs one on top of another. This can result in damage to individual DVDs. The Jean Harlow packaging is the best.
4,"A chilling, yet realistic portrait of life in gangs.","This is an incredible book. It gets you to the bone.I cried during this book.This book exposes what is beneigh the surface. It shows how easy it is for a young man to get into this life in gangs, and how easily it can destroy him and the people around him.Sanchez doesn't write ""My Bloody Life"" with intellectual prose and fancy speech, you won't have any trouble interpreting his writing. But he speaks the truth with gut-level honesty.This book will make you think."
1,Reymundo's Book Not Bad - For Fiction,"As a Veterano member of the Almighty Latin Kings Nation, and an educated man who has, for the last 7 years, held the honor of being one of my Nation's leaders I feel the nessecity to speak on the subject of my former comrade Reymundo's literary rendering. While his book is enterataining to the uninitiated ( much like the movie ""Boyz in the Hood"" or "" New Jack City "" ) It presents very little historical fact. A brief synopsis of what he left out can be found on this website"
1,Save your money,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is a story of self pity and written in the manner of a 5 year old. I actually had to force myself to complete the book, think twice before you buy this one."
1,Dont Believe the Hype!!!,"humboldt park is full of yuppies now, this is unabashed hyperbole.BORING!!!"
2,not what i expected..,i was expecting a tough in your face gritty account of life as a L.K. the same accounts depicted on t.v. documentaries..however i felt the book focused more on the authors sexual escapedes then his actual account of gang life..and the little written of his gang activity is based in the late 70 era..and not at all the magnitude or the rise of L.K. of the modern times of today..i found myself skimming thru ppages and skipping chapters looking for somthing worth reading..it truly lacks..
4,Turn of Events,"I found this book to be interesting. It was sad to see how this man never received love as a child and in turn didn't know what love really was. He was a puppet for his gang who only gave him ""respect"" if he did what he was told. This man's life was out of control from day one. I finished this book in no time as it was interesting to see what happened to him next. I can't wait to read the unmaking of a Latin King."
2,You Must Be Joking!,"I was definitely interested in reading this book, but the fact that the ""spanish"" written in the book was more like spanglish, incorrect grammar, with spanish definitions completely inaccurate made me believe that this was not truly an autobiographical memoir. But when the author proceeds to state that Puerto Ricans were being deported back the island during this time of his life in the book. That is when I finally said ENOUGH!!! Puerto Ricans are AMERICAN CITIZENS BORN TO A COMMOM WEALTH NATION THAT BELONGS TO THE USA!! Before an author begins to write a ""true autobiographical/memoir"" get your facts straight! A proud Puerto Rican knows his/her facts! Interesting book to read, but please, take it with a grain of salt, and remember; all that you read is not always true!"
5,loved this book!!!!!,"Loved this book, learned so much about the population and gang life! I would really want to learn more about it as my job is to work with minority population as a therapist. have recommended this book to many friends as well as students and parents."
5,Excellent,"I have a short attention span, and I still could not put down this book. It's interesting for anyone, like myself, who wonders what the life of a gangster is like."
4,The definitive book on public speaking.,"Great little guide for those of you wishing to ""bring your A game"" to the public speaking arena. Karam provides pearl's of wisdom for the novice speaker. I found the information about overcoming fear to be very helpful."
4,"Books for the striving, talented runner...","John L. Paker Jr. is an elitist, and thank God. Those people who think everything written about running should be aimed at Runner's World readers can stock their shelves with the stuff written from the editors and contributors of that magazine without worry of running out of words. Plenty is written, and will continue to be written for the person who runs for fun, excerise and socialization. For those other people, however, who know what it's like to strive towards fast times, for those people who know what it's like to run 20 quarter mile repeats, and run 100 miles in a week, books by John Parker are for you.Read ""Runner's and Other Dreamers,"" and read ""Once a Runner."" These books will haunt you because they sound like they are describing your inner thoughts, dreams and nightmares. These books tell how it really is to be out there on your own, thrashing your guts out on a trail somewhere...read them and know you are not really alone at all."
5,Addressing both factual events and the religious questions,"Collaboratively written by military chaplains Timothy Demy and Gary P. Stewart , In The Name Of God: Understanding The Mindset Of Terrorism is a comprehensive and informative inquiry into the phenomenon of religious terrorism throughout recent history, from cyberterrorism and information warfare to the September 11 attacks to the threat of nuclear bombs. Addressing both factual events and the religious questions that people ask in the wake of tragic loss, In The Name Of God: Understanding The Mindset Of Terrorism is a chilling and close look at what is really going on behind today's terrible headlines."
4,A Lexicon of Terror--Book Review,"In her study of the Argentinan ""Dirty War"", Feitlowitz does a marvelous job of conveying the true sentiment on the subject from argentines before, during and after the military coup of 1976. The terror, the hopelessness and today's heartwrenching despair. Her book recounts the testimony of families of the ""desaparecidos"" (disappeared) and victims themselves whom she interviewed during her six year research on the subject, in Argentina. She eloquently conveys to the reader the fear and confusion that have been long ingrained in the minds of Argentina's civilians, as the result of the atrocities committed by the dictatorship. As a teenager growing up in Argentina during this period, I attest to the veracity of the emotions delivered by the author in her writings. A must read on the topic!"
3,"Interesting Characters and Premise, Mediocre Presentation","Interesting, engaging characters carry the story, but the plot limps along with little direction, split into two very different halves and culminating in something of an anticlimax. As always, Ferber enclosed the main story with a post-story frame that, in this case, seems to serve little purpose except to moralize about her characters' misdeeds."
3,white man/mixed woman,This is only review that mentions Clio and being 1.2 black. In the movie starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper the nurse reminds Clio not to hope for acceptence because her grandmother was a placee and her mother was a placee. At that time that ment a white man married/single entering into a arrangement with a black or mixed race woman to support her and any off spring produced of that sexual union.
3,flimpsey,"the two separate paint roller areas aren't very deep, plastic is flimsey will have to set inside a reg paint tray"
4,"Yes, it's a Mary Sue, but still a good read!","Tempa Pagel lives in Newburyport, has a little boy and a little girl and a husband. So does her protagonist. Yes, that means we've entered Mary Sue territory. Ordinarily that would totally sink a book, but Pagel still manages to turn in an enjoyable read, believe it or not.Unlike the typical Mary Sue, she avoids turning her protagonist into a hyper-idealized, romanticized version of the life she wants to live, which helps keep the story grounded and readable."
1,ghetto little tuxedo,"I didnt try this on my son right away, I assumed 2T would fit since all other regular 2T clothes do. Well the shirt was too tight, and the stitching around the buttons was gathered and didnt look good. The pants and the hat were cute, but we ended up just spending more and getting him an adorable tuxedo elsewhere. If your spendng a lot of money on your wedding, go the extra mile to make sure your little guys look good its so worth it. He looked awesome in the tux we got him."
2,poor quality,"on the computer the outfit looks good however the material is looks cheap and is of poor quality. The size is inaccurate, very disappointing."
4,Really Cute!,"Outfit is really cute. The fit was perfect. Quality is ok, don't imagine it would last too long if he was wearing it often but seeing how we only need it for 1 day I think it will be fine. Shipping took a while."
2,"So cute, but alas...","This outfit is absolutely adorable!! But I'm giving it 2 stars because the sizing is way off and the fabric seems plow quality. We ordered a 9-month outfit for our 7-month old (who is of average to just-below-average size), and it doesn't fit. We will have to buy a separate shirt, and the pants may still fit when we need it next week, but they'll be a little tight...and his legs are normally still fitting into 3-6 months pants!! Sigh. The hat completely didn't fit, even when it arrived when he was 5.5 months. Sort of expected that, because his head circumfrance is on the larger size, but was a little surprised, given that it's supposed to fit a 9-month old. So we had to buy a new hat. All in all, I would probably suggest buying the knickers/suspenders/tie separately (if that's an option) and trying to find a shirt/hat elsewhere. The other thing about the shirt...it's a tuck in, not a onesie. So on a baby, you can imagine it won't stay put for long."
5,Great Book,"After purchasing this book, it is more about finding more time to read it. The book is filled with amazing facts and stories. I would recommend (and already have) to many of my friends."
5,a must read!,"This book is a must read for any NASCAR fan! I have been a fan for quite some time and it tells a story that I knew little about. The stories of Red Byron, Roy Hall, Lyod Seay, Red Vogt, the Flock brothers and many more! Just one of those books that I couldn't put down. It paints a picture of early NASCAR that has not been talked about for years."
3,Good history,"This is a very well-documented history of the roots of NASCAR, illuminating well- and not-so-well-known facts about its moonshining roots, pioneers in its development and the autocratic role of Bill France. While I enjoyed the story, I felt that this was a book in search of a good editor. There's a lot of repetition -- the same facts told in one place are repeated in another, while some paragraphs begin in exactly the same way, on the same page; all of which got in the way of the story, at least in my opinion. Also, some of Thompson's vernacular was incongruous with the overall tone of his narrative. I found myself editing the book while I read it, which, unfortunately, resulted in a few bumps in what should have been a relatively smoother ride. This being said, it's still a comprehensive and well-researched history of America's fastest-growing sport and, for the most part, very readable."
2,Interesting but lots of inaccuracies,"I purchased the book for a person who is a NASCAR fan and knows the insides of car engines. He liked the idea of the whole book, but felt it had a slow beginning. He continually noted many inaccuracies in the details of how cars work, how parts were modified and which engines were in which cars. His comments included it was very unprofessional of an experienced author to not check his facts and terminology before publishing. Yes, the book is not too detailed to be fun for a non-mechanic to read, but it seems irresponsible to relay information and details that are not true. Those of us who don't recognize incorrect information will be under the assumption that what they read is correct, and that seems a real disservice to all readers."
1,The writer is clueless,"The errors in this book show that the author knows nothing of automobiles. Given the made up ""facts"", such as ""a 1926 Model A Ford"" and ""high compression manifold heads"" (what does that even mean?), no telling how much of the rest of the story he misreported. Typical outsider, trying to claim knowledge he doesn't possess, then writing a monstrosity."
2,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I bought this item online. It is really a neat piece of equipment. It has all the accessories and it worked great.... for about one day. Then it quit.Searching my owners manual; I found no customer service number, only an email adress. Also it had instructions to return the item with a $6 money order and wait 8-12 weeks for a new one.Of course I returned it to the store and bought a different product from a more established manufacturer. Coby should stick to making telephones if they refuse to spend the money on customer service.I think anoter company sells the same item, and reviews of that item have indicated very sketchy quality as well.A GREAT IDEA POORLY EXECUTED!"
1,Power Failure,My children received the Coby for Christmas and it was wonderful and worked great through 3 movies and the power would not come on. We sent it back and got another one and it only worked through one movie and the power did not come on. I would not recommend this product based on others having the same problems.
2,"Very Neat, Until it Fails.","Worked through about three movies, and then failed! Very strange. It would appear to be a power reset issue of some sort, as if it can't work out to use battery power or the adapter connection. When the power key is pressed, the front LED dims for about a second, as if it is trying, then simply sits there. If the battery pack is connected it's LED will switch on for that interval.Still searching for some reset mechanism. If anyone has some info, please post, as this is a very nice unit with great build quality otherwise. Other interesting things:-Rotating the usint on it's y axis can cause the spinning disk to brush against the internals if you do this too quickly.-There's a little holographic sticker over one of the screw holes that says ""NO WARRANTY IF TEARED UP"". Funny! I hope this isn't the reset button."
2,DEAD BEAT UNIT - NOT WORTH BUYING - AVOID AT ALL COSTS,I had the same issue as lots of people in here - Unit played 4 good movies and then suddenly one morning it refused to Turn ON - just displays a red Light and does not power up . tried everything...nothing worked.... i would not buy this unit for free even----now i know why sony is sony and all these small coby's are trash..
1,Was great for a few movies - then died.,"I bought this unit for its great set of features and accessories, but the tablet design is what really sold me on it (very easy to hang in the car). Used it for 3 movies, then half-way into the 4th it died. Unit will not turn on no matter which power source is used. There were no troubleshooting steps for this scenerio in the book. The disc would not eject so I had to use the ""paperclip method"" to open the unit. I was hoping to find some magical ""reset"" method on the web, but only found a lot of other people with this same problem. Returning unit to my retailer."
5,Excellent!,"These were easy to order, the company was very communicative, and the matches were shipped super quickly! The items themselves looked lovely and were a wonderful addition to our favors. The metallic green lettering was perfect! I would recommend this seller and their customized matches!"
1,not worth the paper its printed on,"I thought this was a deal, until I received the item. First off, more than half of the items were printed off center. Then, about one-third of them were spotty where one or more of the printed letters did not show up. The printer did offer for me to send them back and they would be re-printed,but my philosophy is if they didnt get it right the first time, why would it be any better the second time? So I ate the cost, went elsewhere and spent only about 10% more, and was amazed at the superiour quality of the item from the knot.com. sorry, amazon, this seller is not up to par."
5,used for wedding,I was very happy with the product I received. They turned out exactly as I intended and were delivered to me very quickly. I would recommend this product.
4,At last!! A leading role for Reginald Denny!,"By far my favorite of these is Lady in Scarlet. Denny is wonderful in this comedy/mystery. Lots of intrigue will keep you guessing. Denny, remember, was the sidekick in the Bulldog Drummond series. For me he far out shown the various leads.The others movies aren't mearly as good and for me would rate 2 stars."
4,Another Good Collection of Classics,"A really nice group of films at a bargain price.JIGSAW -Tightly-woven plot into print shop owner's death. D.A. thinks its suicide, Assistant D.A. suspects murder connected to a shadowy political organization ""The Crusaders.""THE LADY CONFESSES - Wife missing for 7 years re-appears and then is strangled. Husband is the prime suspect but witnesses confirm his alibi. Plot thickens as another murder occurs.THE LADY IN SCARLET - A lawyer's romantic feelings for his secretary are put on hold when he becomes embroled in the murder mystery of an old friend's husband. A tangled web of extortion, corruption, pilfered bonds and...a second unsolved murder.THE MANDARIN MYSTERY - Skilled sleuth Ellery Queen is on the perplexing case of the chinese Mandarin, a stolen stamp worth $50,000. A dead body is discovered in a locked library, a counterfeiting scam and another murder."
3,It will do,"Entertaining, Quality could be better, audio and video lacking in some cases, missing Dvd #9, but for the price and number of movies not bad."
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly","The good: cheap price [under $3]. The bad: shipping and handling was over $19.00 The ugly: the hanging device was not included as advertised. Having said that, I purchased this model to replace another soda bottle feeder attachment which went bad so I already had a soda bottle with a hanger. I find the span/diameter too small to accomodate [perch] more than 2 birds at most. [squirrels are not an issue where I live] We have a flock of wild finches which regularly visit our feeders. They only use this feeder when the others are empty. The flow of feed is adequate [we use medium grain rice, the birds love it and cheaper than buying an equivalent amount of bird feed] The feeding device functions well and fits our 2 liter bottle as advertised but the amount of feed which sits at the bottom is minimal due to its small size. Will I purchase another? Not anytime soon and probably not from this company because of the UGLY."
3,PLASTIC NOT SQUIRREL PROOF!!!!,"CONCEPT IS GREAT BUT IT LASTED LESS THAN ONE DAY! MY SQUIRRELS ARE TOO AGRESSIVE AND HAD IT DOWN AND CHEWED WITHIN A DAY. OVERALL, IF YOU'RE SIMPLY FEEDING BIRDS AND DON'T HAVE A CRITTER PROBLEM, IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT. CHILDREN CAN DECORATE THE BOTTLE AND IT REALLY WORKS WELL AS AN INEXPENSIVE FEEDER OPTION."
1,wild bird feeders,"We are so pleased with these feeders in our yard. Nice way to recycle those plastic liter bottles too. I bought enough to last for awhile and when we run out, we know where to get more now!Definitely recommend this type to others.Thank you,Larry & JoyAnn"
1,veterinary notes for horses,"not a good copy, pictures very old fashioned could not read some of the script, seemed as if ink had run out on copier. bought as a present but could not use so sent back"
3,Good for What it Is,"We received this toy a year ago and have been playing with it ever since. My daughter 2 yrs old now still likes to scoop up her other bath toys with the net. I like that the net floats on the water so that even in a bubble bath she can find it. The bugs were thrown away long ago. While they are cute they get moldy like any squirty toy and we threw ours away about two months after receiving the toy. For the price, we really got a net and I feel like it was a bit steep. But the play factor for us was worth it. Over all a well made toy that lends itself to some great imaginative play."
3,Some fun.,"Simple toys for the tub. They are durable and creative. Do be sure to drain out each ""bug"" to avoid mold inside of them. A bit steep in the price."
2,Bugs are fine - Net tore the first day,"I was very disappointed in the net in this set--there was a rip after only a few minutes of play in the bathtub, the first time we used it. I would expect toys made for young kids to be slightly more durable than this!"
4,I Love This Show!,"For ""What Not To Wear Fans"" this is a must have! My daughters and I watch it together and its always fun and inspiring!"
4,Great book.,Great book. I love the use of real models and they really cover a LOT of shapes/sizes. I learned a ton!
5,Donde esta Matt en espanol?,"I'm about to buy this set, 'cause I've already known that everything the others have said is true, since I won a 45 of ""My Kind of Girl"" at a drive-in in 1962.Why does noone seem to know that Matt had a huge body of work in Spanish? He was one of the absolute hottest in South America in the late 60's. I was there-heard a song and thought, ""Man, that guy sings like Matt M."", and sure as hell, it was. I've never been able to find much of his work in Spanish-hardly any at all. Even most Mexicans are not familiar, though he had a TV talk show in Mexico City at one time.WHERE IS MATT EN ESPANOL?"
3,Quick Release works too Good!,"i like the case, but the case has a ""feature"" to quick release the belt clip. that release is too easily triggered, resulting in my case being left places unintentionally"
2,What a boring novel...,"The plot looked interesting on the back of the book but after finally finishing (I found myself skimming through many pages), all I could think of was how much time I wasted reading it. I was even more disappointed to learn that there was a sequel so I wasn't even granted an end to this dull novel. The first few chapters were interesting and held promise but then the story just lost its charm and plodded along . All the characters (except for Osmond Kott) were basically the same--loving, caring, good, noble, beautiful. I found Price's writing to be too flowery and idealistic. She needs to spice things up more to hold my interest. I do not recommend this book unless you want to learn a little about the South during that era. And if you're looking for a romance novel--go for the ones that have real passion in them."
4,Interesting for visitors to Savannah,"I began this book prior to a trip to Savannah, using the guidebook ""Sojourn in Savannah,"" which has an excellent fold-out map, to familiarize myself with the places mentioned. Although I didn't finish ""Savannah"" until after my trip, I found it provided a good historical background on the city. It wasn't among the most compelling works of historical fiction I've read, but the characters were interesting and the book provided a valuable perspective on Savannah at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries.Visitors interested in the city's beautiful buildings should consider taking Jonathan Stalcup's ""Architectural Tour of Savannah."" The easy 90-minute walking tour included many of the places mentioned in the book and was doubly interesting because of the connections."
3,Wrong size,"The last person to review this show said they run small, I think they run big. Im usually a size 6 and I got a 6 today and it is way too big for me. Im going to have to reorder a 5.5 or even 5."
5,Heavenly,"Sweet god, what a great record. The music and the way it was recorded in the studio is just AMAZING. Love and Rockets here give us one of the most solid records I've heard from the 1980's. The songs are fresh sounding solid rock (injected with a sense of grandeur and not a trace of sugar coated fakeness - yet it has huge mainstream appeal they play L&R; on the radio a lot), you could tell it was a new direction for Daniel Ash & Co. Just a fantastic record from the 80's amazing blend of rock, synthesizer, drums and good lyrics! Take a dash of Beatles, throw in some Jesus & Mary Chain, some Bluesy Rock, Dylan and finally a nice thick layer of gothic roots - then you have Love and Rockets.""Live a life you love, use the God you trust and don't take it all too seriously.""This is the repackaged edition - the whole album is remixed and sounds perfect also the album art is different. Included is a little booklet about the band's origin."
1,Who writes all these five star reviews??? The author???,"This is the worst book I ever bought and read. I've read thousands and a hundred or more on Aliens and UFOs. I agree with everything the reader from California said. The writing is Okay, but the story, plot and characters reak! Sorry but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it."
1,Worthless tripe,The only reason I did not rate it less is that the option is not available. Weak plotline- unbelievable characters- no continuity. My Advice? If you are interested in the subject you would be better off joining the Self Realization Fellowship (which I also do not recommend)
5,INTERESTING,The Great Pyramid; crop circles; abductions; Operation Paperclip at the end of World War Two; Easter Island; the Men In Black (STAAR); Atlantis; Aurora; of course AREA 51-- have I forgotten anything? This book has it all and pulls it together nicely from the perspective of some relatively ordinary people caught up in events greater than them. VERY ENGROSSING
3,Good Science Fiction but Bad Translation to Kindle,"I read this book (and most of the others in the series) some number of years ago. I remember that it was a good science fiction story. I also remember running out of books - I thought the last book in the series was written at that time, but it wasn't.I decided to re-read it on the Kindle recently. I think it still is an interesting story - a different take on the Roswell/Area 51 classic stories; although, maybe not as compelling as when I read it may years ago. However, it seems the translation from print to the Kindle is rather sloppy. There are misspellings, incorrect grammar, etc. is multiple parts of the book. I don't remember these being in the original paperbacks I read but I have not checked.In any event, I would still recommend the book, but maybe not at the top of the list."
3,Area 51,It was exciting and captivating most the way through but then it seemed like it was rushed to conclusion by including positive outcomes for several very difficult situations.
4,"Old-School ""Grays"" and Conspiracies","Reading this book was like time traveling to the 50s through the 1990s when it was written. Area 51 is a solid alien encounter / abduction / Cold War / conspiracy novel. Looking at the cover, I have to admit I was leery. It looks like a media tie-in, but it was surprisingly well-written. Now I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. I liked the characters, especially Turcotte and Kelly, and I thought most of the twists and turns were plausible if over-the-top. Sometimes it was predictable, too. The ending was especially larger than life, but I guess that's expected in techno thrillers of this scope. Reading Area 51 was like watching ""Independence Day"" or ""Cowboys vs. Aliens."" It was good fun but a little silly."
5,Bob Mayer's Area 51 Series,"Amazon asked me to review this book. By the time I received their request I had read the entire series - it's just that good! Sure, some of the scenes are a little over the top but the plot continues to unfold throughout the series, developing characters book-by-book until you suspect EVERYONE of not being who or what they seem to be. Without divulging anything of the plot buy the first in the series, and then go ahead and buy and rest of them at once, because you'll just waste time buying them individually. I was hooked! Good stuff!"
3,Si-fi thriller has its good points.,People get so crazy about Area 51 that I was hesitant to read this book but it turned out to be a fun si-fi adventure.If you really get into Area 51 and UFO 's you will probably enjoy this book.
3,"good story, but the typos!","This is a good story, but the e-book is riddled with typos! Most of the ""he'd""s and ""don't""s are capitalized throughout the book - regardless of placement in the sentence. It was terribly distracting; half the time my phrasing would get thrown off because my brain would say ""new sentence"", but it wasn't.I gave the story a 3 because it was interesting enough to keep me reading regardless of the lack of editing...I'm not certain if poor editing is an aspect of e-books. I came away believing self-publishing was the source of the evil after falling for one of Amanda Hocking's drivel (gawd only knows how why she became popular). But this book is published by Dell. Maybe they did a bad convert to Kindle format??If I were the author, I would be horrified."
5,Whew-- talk about pulling it all together!,"The author uses every-- and I mean every-- mystery on the face of the planet in this story. Guess there's some he might have missed, but I imagine they'll be in the sequels. But it works, kind of, if you're willing to suspend a little belief, but hey, it's fun. Good action scenes. I've read both books-- the sequel Area 51 The Reply-- and am looking forward to the third-- Area 51 The Mission. I would also recommend some other books-- Alien Rapture by Steiger is good. Darlington's book is good if you want to know a lot about Area 51 and the strange people who surround it."
3,"A thin plot for a thick book. Otherwise, pretty good.","To spite the fact that the book was obviously written with ""soon to become a major motion picture"" forefront in the authors mind, I thought it was good.I usually expect to get more out of a book then the wiz-bang stuff you see in an action flick. Not in this book. I did enjoy that fact that for once I got to read about this cool stuff, without someone insisting that this is ""real"".Overall, a good light read. Especially if you are into this kind of X-File stuff, like me. :-)Andre"
2,Where is the quality in the formatting???,"So far I have read the first two books.The story so far is really good. The only problem I have is the conversion to digital is the worse I have ever seen on here.I have about 90 books purchased from Kindle, and the formatting into digital for these two books is almost worth not buying.IF you fix the formatting for this series, I will give it an 8 out of 10 rating. As it is right now, I would give it a two.I don't know how a book gets converted into Kindle format, but if the author has to pay someone to do it, they need to get their money back."
4,Wanting to lose myself,"I guess i started reading this book after first reading another series from the same writer. Possibly expected too much of the same, but found this book great once i got into it.enjoy"
2,area 51,"Previous reviews stated that while this series was not great literature, it was not useless. i tend to strongly disagree. This is by far the largest waste of eyesight and liesure time I have invested in my 56 years of reading."
3,too many books,If you start with this book keep in mind that you will need to order the next 5 books to finish the story! Each book in the series is really just a chapter. Don't get me wrong it is a good series but at the end of each book you see that you must order the next one. I'm glad I'm finally done.
5,Wow-- everything and anything--,"What more could this author have put in this book? You name it, it's here-- UFOs, crop circles, the Great Pyramid, Easter Island, on and on. And it works. That's the amazing thing."
4,Mysteriously Intrigued,I found this science fiction novel extremely fascinating as it filled my mind with exciting ideas. It makes you feel very alive to imagine that an alien colony visited our planet over ten thousand years ago leaving behind technology beyond that of most people's comprehension. I seriously plan to read the next two novels furthering my imagination of the UFO phenomenon.
2,"Silly plot, flat characters","After reading all the glowing reviews, I bought Area 51. I can't believe this is the same book everyone else is reviewing. It's not a bad book, but it is certainly not a 5-star book.Area 51 attempts to explain every mystery in the world, like Atlantis, the Great Pyramid, Easter Island, UFOs, crop circles, cave paintings, the creation of the atom bomb, the Nazis, and your wife's latest haircut. The large amount of mysteries described and supposedly solved with a single common solution really stretches the believability factor. The plot, while action-packed, is silly and unbelievable. The characters are static, two-dimensional, cookie-cutter stereotypes with no growth or development whatsoever.Area 51 is a quick pulp novel with not a lot of depth. If you just want a quick mindless read, it's okay. If you're looking for something with a bit more meat and believability, look elsewhere."
4,Alright,It's is about fiction alright it was a good book about UFO and about like aliens and so forth etc
5,Fantastic !,"Facts and Fiction intermingle to tell one hell of a story! A fantastic read for both believers and non-believers... especially if u are well versed with UFOlogy, u will find it a compelling read... its got it all - alien spacecraft to ancient Egyptian secrets - the whole thing :)) Full 5 stars!"
4,Very believable sf.,A great fun read that mixes all of the subjects from the Coast to Coast radio show. Mr. Mayer 's background and education shine through in the best possible way.
5,works,"we have three humidifiers that all look the same, but are different brands...the filters worked for all three and the cost was fair"
1,Doesn't work,I bought 3 of these to use with my Honeywell HCM-890. The humidifier won't work with them. Maybe they are too thick. I'm not sure what the problem is but I bought a new humidifier (same model) to test it and it didn't work with that one either.
1,Wrong size,The dimensions given are not accurate. Truck body is much shorter than listed. We will be returning this product. Very disappointed.
3,The Truth is Not always what it seems.,"I was Pre-Trib, Pre-Mil for the last 17 years, simply following what all the popluar authors taught and nevery really being a 'Berean'. I bought this book to give to any of my ""misguided"" friends who might know the ""Truth"". It sat on my bookshelf for about a year before I decided to read it. I beleive it was one of the best decisions of my life. I immediatly began to find many theological faults, improper exegesis, and just plain poor biblical hermeneutics in it. I couldn't believe that I had fallen for this garbage for so long. I give it three stars because it has broken me from my errorful ways of interperting the bible. No longer does a certain eschatology theory rule my theology, now theology rules my eschatology. I have done a full blown study in dispensationalism (which is what these authors preach) and have found it wrought with errors. It is unbiblical and was only brought about to help premote the pre-trib, pre-mil. viewpoint."
1,Pointless,"Although I didn't pay for it.. we have this book at work. I've never read any of the Visual QuickStart (sounds like a Microsoft product!) books before, hope they're not all like this. Quicktime Pro isn't exactly rocket science as it stands, so a book is going to have to have some good information in it to make it worth.I give you an example - ""Creating Video from Many Images. 1. From the file menu, choose Open Image Sequence. 2. In Open dialog box, locate and select any one of the sequentially named files and click Open."" etc. etc. As I said, QTPro isn't rocket science. I followed this guide and had a problem. I clicked on the sequentially named files and it wouldn't load more than 2 images. Why? The book didn't give me any clues. I found out from trial and error, it's dependant on file names. Sorry, but this book is pointless. It's like a 360 page book on the DIR command."
4,Perfect mellow pop,This EP is a nice taste of what you can expect from albums like Full Issac and Nobodys cool. This band is and will continue to be the best little know pop band that ever was. A band that stays with you when other bands fade. Perfect mellow pop.
1,"I've read a lot of crap, but this takes the cake","I'm not going to take up much room with this one-- but this was one of the crappiest books I've read in a long time. I usually enjoy the recitation of gear (think Beowulf...) but we're talking camping gear, here. The Deliverance-like scene was way too graphic,which I might have been willing to accept if it had served a decent plot point-- but it doesn't. There aren't many instances where I'll not finish a book, but I'm debating not finishing tis one. And that's especially hard for me-- I was an English major and know how to tease out substance from challenging literature. That would be a waste of time with this book, though."
1,the west nile virus of fiction,"what happened to richard matheson? fine short story writer turns to what john d. macdonald called ""irving books."" bloated, badly written and just plain stupid. this book gets one star only because it cannot get none. thank god for libraries - i didn't have to waste money on what might be the worst book i've ever read. please encourage your local libraries not to waste theirs.absolutely dreadful."
3,"Unimpressive, but not as bad as most reviews suggest!","This book has a lot of bad reviews. While I agree the book isn't about anything novel, it is entertaining to read.The book in short, is about two men who go off on a camping/hiking trip for a few days. One is a writer who knows nothing of the outdoors while his ""friend"" is more savvy in this area and serves as his guide.Things quickly turn bad when it turns into a chase of cat and mouse. I must admit, this book is explicit and rather depraved- and I think that's probably the strongest part in the book. Conversly, I think that part also turns many readers off, as the homosexual sex that takes place is so explicit, that it can be a lot to stomach.If you are into homoerotica, you'll probably enjoy this book. It is way too ""out there"" for the housewife but if you don't mind hearing the intimate details of homosexual sex, you'll probably enjoy the plot."
2,Written past reason ... and then some!,"Based on the many positive blurbs from other well-known writers that appeared on the cover, I picked this one up thinking it might be a grand introduction to a great writer I had somehow overlooked all these years. Having read it now, I feel that neither the introduction or the oversight was all that grand.Matheson takes a classic thriller idea -- one man hunts another in the wilderness -- and loses it in a wild, untamed land of unlikable, unbelievable characters and less-than-possible plot twists. Despite being well-written when it comes to style, HUNTED PAST REASON is not written well enough that one suspends all reason or disbelief to get thoroughly lost in the story.If you're hunting for a good thriller, you're on the wrong trail with this one."
1,A totally predictable retread.,"The title says it all, baby! This story is so old that Alfred Hitchcock would call it derivative. Can't understand why this rotten old story was published. Several mispellings in this tale and the strong liberal bent reduced this novel from a strong 2 to a very weak 1. Better luck next time, Dick. Loved your Hell House, though."
1,"Oh, Please....","Absolutely, without question, the worst book I've ever managed to finish. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Predictable, uneven, and....stupid. By halfway in, I found myself hoping that the ""bad guy"" would be successful in his quest to off the whining, moaning, holier-than-thou ""hero"". My God, this was a terrible book. The absolute capper for me was the episode with the trapped mountain lion. How lame can you get? This appears to me to have been a ""Outer Limits"" screenplay gone terribly wrong."
1,"Predictable, mindless, boring","Reading this novel was like watching a B suspense movie. Stock characters, predictable plot, and no surprise ending, violence, and an annoying narration between the main character and himself! Highly not recommended."
3,Not all that bad,"Wow, there are a lot of negative reviews for this book. Maybe I'm out of place or something, but I found it to be rather entertaining. Sure, you have to suspend your belief at times, but what horror/suspense book doesn't require the same treatment? I have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed Matheson's earlier works a great deal more than this one. However, I still turned the pages as quick as almost any book. I didn't find it tedious to read or boring at all. I think perhaps this book is getting an unfair shake. At the same time, I'm not going to give it a super-high rating either. I sure hope Matheson puts another book out soon, I've always been a fan of his. Perhaps I'm showing some bias, but he certainly didn't lose me with this book."
1,Likely the worst book I've ever read,It's a shame I can't give it less than one star. There is no reason to ever read this book.
1,I wish I'd known,"... how lousy this book was. I wish I'd thought to log in to Amazon and read the other reviews before being sucked in by the Matheson name in an airport bookstore. I wanted to throw the book down the air-flusher.It was like a bad dream I couldn't wake from. I kept waiting for the REAL Richard Matheson to appear -- the one from I, Legend, Hell House, Stir of Echoes. But know, some James Dickey wannabe has obviously taken over his mind. I found the plot to be tired, and the sex/violent scenes to be gratutious. Now, mind you, I'm not one to shrink from erotic horror and I've even published vampire stories, (including a short-short I dedicated to Mr. Matheson), but this was simply hack work.Next time, I'll buy a classic from the airport bookstore, and wait to log on and read the reviews at Amazon."
1,Stupid Beyond Reckoning,"If bad writing were a crime, Richard Matheson would be on death row.As it is, I feel like I've done hard time by reading this book.Mr. Matheson uses the protagonist in this book as a vehicle to float every left-leaning, New Age theory imaginable: he's pro-reincarnation, anti-gun, anti-violence, pro-animal rights. And the results are almost laughably absurd. After the main character has been sodomized and beaten and is fleeing a psycopath in the forest, our hero stops his escape to rescue a cougar that has been trapped by a fallen log. Why not brew a little latte' while you're at it? And after the psychopath rapes the protagonist's wife as a prelude to murdering the hero and the hero gains the upper hand, the protagonist refuses to kill the pyschopath ""because that would make him like the psychopath."" Huh?It's this kind of muddleheaded thinking that the reader must endure thoughout the book. Save your money and your time. Look elsewhere."
1,terrible,"I must admit that I've always wondered why Matheson's books are considered classics in the horror genre. For the most part they're readable, some even stay with you for a while, but classics? No. So all I expected from this one was a moderately enjoyable read. I didn't get even that. While the writing was competent, it was extremely repetitive. Either Matheson was afraid the reader would forget what he'd said ten, or even five pages back, or he kept forgetting that he'd already told us something. There's enough half-baked philosophy in here to fill a dozen self- help books, the situations which arise are improbable, to say the least, and the ending is like something out of a B slasher movie. Just when you thought the villain was dead ... guess what?"
4,4 1/2 stars,"When Bob Hansen, a successful author, and Doug Crowley, a middle of the road actor, set out on a hike, Bob begins to realize that he doesn't know Doug as well as he thought.With a narrative that draws you in, Matheson's latest is a highly suspenseful novel that will make you read non-stop till the thrilling end. You'll be reminded very much of the movie `Deliverance' when you come to certain spots. Gruesome visuals and intense action make this a thriller you won't soon forget.Recommended."
3,Basic Sciences,"Purely a basic science perspective to surgery. If you are weak in this area, then it might be what you need. It is not designed as a clinical text. It is dense, slow to read, and a great sedative, but honestly, it is beneficial if you need to touch up you basic science fund of knowledge."
5,On the border of genius,"Calexico is a great band, though not necessarily a great live band. Invite Mariachi de Luna de Luz to the party and that's taken care of. Excellent musicianship and the charisma of the fine musicians of De Luna de Luz makes this DVD a fine experience. All the tradition of mariachi music with the artistry of Joey Burns and Co. Discover the next new best thing."
4,a great introduction to a classic,I 'discovered' Hoagy Charmichael as an undergraduate at Indiana University and this was the first piece of Charmichael's work I ever bought. My original copy was a tape I played again and again until there was nothing left but squeaks. This recording has the best collection I have found of Charmichael performing his own work. I have since purchased many recordings of Charmichael's work but this will always be my favorite.
5,Great Early Recordings,"Carmichael was there on the ground floor of the pre-big band era when jazz was king and the men who would be giants just hung out and played together. Bix, the Dorsey brothers, Goodman, Goldkette and more. Here you can catch how jazz influenced the sound of pop in the late twenties and how perfectly suited to that sound Carmichael's compositions were, while still managing to push the envelope on new and interesting changes.It's always a pleasure to hear him work. He was cool long before it was in vogue, relaxed and yet always in control. (Trivia note-- Carmichael was Ian Fleming's idea of what James Bond would be like.)"
4,Do not overlook these classics,"I wish someone had told me earlier how good these books are. I picked up a used paperback of ""The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu"" and, even before I had reached page 50, I knew that I had to have more. I therefore rushed out to find these omnibus editions. Sax Rohmer wrote the Fu Manchu stories between 1912 and the late 1950s. From a chronological standpoint, then, but also thematically, Rohmer serves as a literary bridge between Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and Ian Fleming's James Bond.Put the political considerations aside, and enjoy these tales as a reflection of the times. They are worthy of a wider, modern audience."
5,Get your kids to read!,"I am not reviewing a particular book however I feel if a parent is trying to encourage his child to read, any of Rohmer's stories may will be a good place to start.I was 14 years of age when I read my first Sax Rohmer story, ""The Green Eyes of Bast."" I can remember exactly where I was and the feeling of creepiness that enthralled me. A combination of mystery and horror is a good combination to entrap the imagination of a youngster.With all else vying for your kids' attention these days getting them to enjoy reading just for the pure fun of it can prove difficult at best. I found that introducing my teenage son to Mr. Rohmer worked resulting in his reading becoming a habit that has stayed with him into adulthood.There are of course many other authors that may well do the same but Rohmer worked for me as well as my son. What the heck, why not give it a try?The Green Eyes of Bast - Sax Rohmer"
1,Buyer Beware!,"To the publisher of this ebook and to Kindle readers: I downloaded the free sample of this ebook out of curiousity. Unfortunately, this book was not Dr Fu Manchu but a Jack London book! Please fix this error! Thanks!"
3,"Silly, Silly, Silly!","When these stories were written they were in the horror genre, but now they are in the hilarity-horror subgenre, like the movie The Gremlins. Dr. Fu Manchu is found in a Chinese opium den in London, complete with a trapdoor that drops all unwelcome policemen into the Thames. This opium den is festooned with - Yiddish theatrical posters! Apparently to Sax Rohmer, anything east of Greece is ""Oriental"". Oh, how we wish al-Quaida were just like Dr. Fu Manchu, limiting themselves to weapons such as red centipedes and poisonous Burmese snakes."
1,No good junk,Handle binding from the start. Required manually lifting the handle after each staple. After approximately 60 staples it stopped engaging staples. It would cycle but not fire a staple. Do not wast your money. Design and qquality are junk.
2,Baby Ben knobs too small,"I have been having so much trouble finding a wind up clock WITHOUT a battery! When I saw the selection at Amazon I was so happy. I read the reviews, I loved the look of this clock because the colors were unique. The knobs to set the clock and the alarm are so close together, but I worked through that. The problem is the small ""alarm"" area shown on the front of the clock. It is not accurate. When you are depending on this clock it better go off at the time I ""thought"" I set it for but it was never accurate. I would rather have the alarm be a hand that I can set instead of a little box. Nice looking clock but not good enough to rely on."
3,Doesn't quite keep time,I found this clock for my husband and he was really excited to receive it. It worked okay but the time was always off. He tried to get it right but it still didn't stay on time. He has put it away for now but maybe he will get it out again and play with it. It's still a very nice clock...small and compact. If only we could get it to keep time.
2,"Worked OK, but not as durable as it should be","I got this clock about 6 months ago, and the screw holding the alarm-set post in place has already broken. It's a nice looking clock, but don't get it expecting a solid lifetime of use like Westclox used to make."
3,Rather Unattractive,"This alarm clock keeps time well and has a sturdy and heavy metal body and felt bottom built to last. The face is not exactly the same color as pictured, nor are the numbers as attractive. It is rather difficult to set the alarm precisely, it would be nearly impossible to set it for a time like 5:17. Also, the colors clash with the tan/brown face, beige body and gold around the face and alarm button. I've included two pictures of what it really looks like."
5,Reliable alarm clock,The sound volume of my dinky little battery powered travel alarm clock just doesn't do the job. The wind-up mechanical Baby Ben is far more effective for me at home and on the road.
3,"Missing the correct 45 single edit of ""Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)""","First of all take note that some of the reviews here were posted prior to the Deluxe re-issue by Funky Town Grooves. The re-issue gives you every track on the LP plus bonus 12"" and single versions. Only problem is they made one big mistake. The 7"" edit of the hit single ""Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)"" used on this CD is the same INCORRECT edit that has appeared on CD for the past two decades. Still a good purchase, but if you are looking for the correct 45 edit of that song it is not on here. They missed the opportunity I'm afraid."
5,Should've made the top 40 in the U.S.,"It baffled me when I heard the music on video programs in the 80's that it wasn't getting well received on the pop charts and I vowed back then that one day I would explore Kershaw's music more thoroughly. It took me over 20 years but I finally made good on it. I am as pleased with the music as I was then.This is catchy, jazz-like rhythm with playful lyrics that are compelling without all the preachy tirades you might get in the more common 80's intellectual songs. Some of the songs may seem more eccentric but all have something catchy and enjoyable. A unique 80's experience for those who only know the U.S. chart-toppers."
3,Nik Kershaw knows what's good for you,"Nik Kershaw was an unfortunately typical artist in the video-happy 80's. Tuneful, photogenic and big on synths, he was a cross between George Micheal and Howard Jones. That is epitomized on his biggest international hit, ""Wouldn't It be Good."" The video was typical of the period, wild haircuts, ersatz Bowie posturing and satellite dishes. The album ""Human Racing"" became his biggest hit and he established himself overseas, but is pretty much a one-hit wonder in the US.This collection doesn't do much to dissuade anyone from thinking his lack of star magnitude was unjust. The songs on the collection are pretty run of the mill, with only ""I Won't Let The Sun Go Down on Me"" and ""The Riddle"" (which was the title track to his second album and another pretty cool video) being the most interesting and individualistic songs here. For those three, this collection rates 3 stars. As for the rest, it's a tad on the generic side."
1,Might as well have bought the single,"Although there are some good covers available on iTunes, one can't get the original ""Wouldn't it be Good?"" unless they buy one of these Kershaw compilation discs and this was the cheapest one! Because they are ""imports"", some cost upwards of $20."
3,waiting for it to work,I have used eb5 for going on 20 years and love it. I was getting some puffyness in my eyes and thought I would try the eye cream. I have been using it now for two weeks and so far I see no difference. Maybe it takes a little more time to work.
2,Heads Up repackaged a used headliner,"I purchased this headliner for my 2003 Xterra. When the package arrived I matched the color to the existing headliner and it was perfect. After tearing the SUV apart and preparing the headliner board for the new material I finally opened the package. The headliner material had several stains on it. In one spot there were two black stains about two inches in diameter. There were several slivers of wood everywhere and they were embedded in the material. Additionally, I counted seven black stains about 1/4 inch diameter all over the place. They material was not rolled nicely either. When I unrolled it there were so many creases I could not even count them. There is no way that I could have applied the material to the headliner board in the condition it was received.The head liner material looks like it would work perfect if it was not delivered in such poor condition."
4,Iron Tabs,This is the best price I have found for iron tablets. Ordering and recieving the product was easy and trouble free.
4,Watchout Camel Fans,"For those who like Yes, Camel or Genesis, add Osiris to your list of Prog. Rock bands. Great work for a band who recorded this CD back in early 80's & still sounds great as east meets west in their music. Once again fantastic job from an arabic origin band."
2,meh...,"This is clearly written for people who know nothing about skinheads, straightedge, punk, 2nd wave ska, etc. etc. That gets real annoying, plus stupid considering something like 90% (surprising accurate figure pulled from thin air) of this book's readers are people who have some knowledge of all that.There's also some stupid lines. I felt embarrassed when whats-her-name goes ""promise you'll be straight-edge with me.""Meh... the bok's ok. Its a quick read at least. Kinda' stupid how the end there's review questions... like we're in sixth grade English... wonder when this book will make it to those kids. In twenty years will it be read like the Outsiders? I doubt it.If you can pick up a copy for a couple bucks, I wouldn't laugh at you for buying it. I mean, I did. But I'd say you're better off just saving your cash and reading it in the store."
2,REAL SKINHEADS,"WAKEY WAKEYSkinheads is a youth culture that started in Britain in the early 70's. We had kids shaving and then slashing their heads with razor blades before they came to school just to make an impression. They scared the pants off me:steel capped doc martins, and agro.My bus trips home from school could be an absolute torture. Still we all grow up and other parts of the world take up what the Brits left behind. It never ceases to amaze me that the yanks have somehow adopted this working class British cultural phenomenon without realising what it is they are latching on to.I am not sure I liked this book it seemed too much a parody of hte real thing."
2,Joe Hawkins with a tye dye,"This book is moderatley entertaining. It even slightly touches on some reality. Overall, it is yet another book about skinheads, written by somebody who knows absolutley nothing about them besides what he can pick up in books. Oh well, should I really be so suprised?"
1,Cartoon Skin,"What a terrible waste of time this book turned out to be. This is nothing but vulgar fantasy for mass entertainment. Of course the nazi skins in this pathetic pandering mess are nothing but cartoon cannon fodder for the ""good guy"" skins. Honestly folks I have known ALOT of nazi skins and none of them acted this way or would have tolerated it from someone else.Anyone who says this is even remotely realistic knows absolutely nothing about the scene. As stated this is just pandering to mass entertainment fantasies and is a staggering disappointment for anyone looking for an objective and honest view into skinhead culture. Save your buck and go buy some...gum or something."
1,OK BUT BADLY RESEARCHED,THIS BOOK WAS WELL WRITTEN AND THE STORY WAS OK BUT WHERE WERE THE SKINS?!?!?!? ALL I READ ABOUT A BUNCH OF STRAIGHT EDGE SKINGIRLS AND POT SMOKING HIPPY SKINS!!! THIS BOOK WAS BADLY RESEARCHED!!!
1,Skin who?,"I just got this book the other day. Thinking it would be a story of what real Skins have to put up with everyday. After reading the first 50 pages about black skins, mestizo skins and white skins hanging out together drinking and smoking pot, i realized how lame this book really is. People tend to think the real Skins had no pride in themselves during the sixties, do we forget how the Skins traded roles and ever since then Skinhead is a one way thing, its a sense of pride for white working class. Blacks did not event Skinhead. I have to laugh at this book. It is a complete joke."
5,the best book ever,"this is my favorite book and it made me love reading after [cruddy] books in high school made me think all books ... This IS a beautiful book. If you don't feel like buying it get it from the local free library and love it there.one thing, there is a little bit of, um, [homosexual] subtext in the book, and you wonder about the friendship after a while."
3,Heads Up!,"I found this book well written. However, having ""grown-up"" in during the Gorgon (Medusa) era I found it to be more than fictional. I know the real ""Timmy Penn"" and the whole gang. Anti Racist Skins? What! Are you kidding? They were just the opposite.What is amusing is that one was black and the other a Jew...and they were the worst. So maybe the author decided to take them to there extreme opposites? These guys where and most still remain complete losers. I still see them around doing the same old -Drugs, Booze, no real job to speak of...and most are in their 30's. It was hard for me to read this book without puking. To portray these guys other than the bastards that they really are is so verymisleading."
4,Very well written and very touching.,"This is a great story about youth, maturity, excess, violence, brotherhood, and unity.The character, ""Alex"" in the story is someone you bond with right from the minute he tells his tale and he sets off after his parents are arrested for selling marijuana for the streets of Chicago. His fellow skins are also very inspiring and have their moments. The character goes through a lot of self-redemption and asks a lot of questions about life and where he fits in.This is a modern day Huck Finn like adventure. It never dies and you can never put it down. The author, Alex DeGrazia, did an amazing job on this book and I wish he'd write another like this or a sequel to it."
2,Inexperienced,"This novel, while having an interesting premise, has the feel of the writing of an eigth grader who has just discovered Minor Threat and Bad Brains. It's melodramatic and does not ring true at all. It's all a bit too ideal, too much fantasy--skinhead family, Tim's room, the free Doc Matens....meh. Read it and you'll understand."
4,Pungent & Convincing,"DeGrazia's ""story"" rings with autobiographical verisimilitude. There are some well-turned literary fluorishes and plot twists to boot. A great book for a snow day or a long flight."
5,dead-on about the skin movement with a killer fiction story,"I grew up in the time and place of this book-- and man-- does this guy know how to write. He nailed the mood-- the feelings of desperation that swirled around in those days. It seemed like nobody who hung out around Clark and Belmont had it together-- bad families--real poor-- parents on booze-- whatever. But everybody clung to each other for a sense that they belonged to something. I feel like I knew every single one of these characters in the book-- even though I know this is plainly a fictional account of a very true movement-- and dead on about the skins-- the good, the bad and the ambivalent. It's a complex thing all of it-- and De Grazia tells it just right. The guy knows what he's writing about-- in the past many things written about skinheads have been a sick sorry excuse for the truth. Thanks for telling the truth."
2,Really?,"I am amazed by the fantastic reviews. The book feels like a first year Fiction student wrote it. And am I the only one that noticed all the grammatical errors? Why doesn't the author know the correct way of using ""me""/ ""I""? Very strange. I feel like a lot of the good reviews come from other Chicagoans. It's like being a fan of a band just because your boyfriend's in it."
3,US Skins but no Rudies,I found the book a good reported view of a kid getting caught up in the Skin culture. I found Ratz are Nice by Lawrence Ytzhak Braithwaite a little more from the street level. Tim is an opposite to Braithwaite's shifty but cool Edison. But it's still good to see 2 novels out there with great Skin characters and about the American Skinhead Nation.
4,"A good book, not a great epic","I think that American skin is a good book and tells a great, intereting story. It gets a bit farfetched at times, but Alex Verdi is an unlikely hero, battling his own demons and becomming a skinhead along the way.The fact that Alex was a skin isn't the focal point of the story, or at least, it shouldn't be. Too many people get wrapped up in that fact that they base the whole book on the fact that skinhead-ism wasn't accurately portrayed or the scene was wrong or such. Just concentrate on the story."
5,Hard Core Fable,"The straight ahead telling of this tale is deceptive. Despite the realistic depiction of modern-day steet life, this is, in fact, an often-times surreal, dreamlike, and mythical meditation on the eternal qualities of contemporary American life. All of the gritty, realistic strands of this story are intertwined with glowing threads of classic fable. You could say that some of De Grazia's plot twists are throwbacks to the Greeks, but I would say they are less nods to fatalism than they are declarations of faith. The most prominent lynchpins of the structure protrude proudly, and defiantly, like the shiny brass rivets in a pair of Levi's jeans. What a novel for our times. Congatulations."
5,Fastest plane ride of my life,"I read a great deal on planes because of business but this one was more than a quick thriller. I hadn't heard of it before but since my brother insisted I thought I'd take it along, not expecting much because his taste is very different from mine. I liked it from take off. Plenty of action but also really thoughtful. Alex, the narrator, was really natural and not stilted like I feel about most new first person fiction. I read the whole way home and was one of the last to get off the plane. I can't wait to recommend it to my friends."
5,Captures the spirit of old school and does it justice,"so maybe Don DeGrazia doesn't do the best job of hiding the fact that the Gorgon was in fact Medusas, but hey, anyone who was around in the 80's and early 90's and happened to be weird could figure that out! It's just refreshing to see someone actually tell it like it is and show that not all Skins are racists and actually say ""hey, the only real Skins are the anti-racist one's"". I was never a Skinhead, but I've had many many friend's who were and I wish some of the hardest one's were still around to read this book... I think they would appreciate it greatly."
4,"Great Bag, but if the color matters to you....","I purcahsed this bag for my Father for Christmas, he does not use it for camping, but as his couch cozy....so the color would matter in this case. The pictures on everything I have seen made it look brown/tan. It arrived today, very quickly I might add, and well, it is not brown/tan at all. This bag is GREEN! The inside is a very bright green/yellow and the outside is a dark olive green. The construction seems very good, as it is with all Coleman Products. This bag is also sufficiently heavy too. I hope that he will still like it, although it completely clashes with his living room interior. If not, I will have to return. To conclude, if this bag is not for camping use, and the color matters, just be aware that this bag is green."
2,massive,"I saw that other people really liked these sleeping bags for car camping, which my boyfriend and I intend to do. However, each one of these sleeping bags is massive! We both fit in just one of them and they weighed (and took up) a ton of room! I would not recommend these even for car campers."
5,"Great for camping cuddles, but not ""portable""","This is a large sleeping bag. Think a queen size comforter, when you unzip and fold the things flat.I bought two of them, since they can be zipped together into one large sleeping bag. My girlfriend and I were planning a number of camping trips and we wanted to be able to be wrapped up rather than stuck in separate sleeping bags. These bags fit the bill.Now, the downside: these are NOT small sleeping bags. After they are rolled up, they're still the size of a large duffel. Each. Fortunately our trips were mostly festivals and large campgrounds where we were driving in, so this wasn't a problem. If you're carrying these around for any significant amount of time, you should probably look at a smaller option.They're machine-washable, but you'd have to go to a laundromat or somewhere with large machines.Great value!"
3,"Warm bag, but very delicate","It is a very warm sleeping bag, but shoddily made. The bottom (feet side) zipper area, the stitching holding the zipper and fabric has broken, thus creating a hole (Kind of voids the idea of having a sleeping bag). Mind you, it is not a rip, but there is a hole. I only slipped into the sleeping bag and this happened, so apparently you need to be very careful when using this if you don't want to damage this so called ""rugged"" item. I won't return the item because I know how to sow and can fix this problem, but I'm just saying that for the money (I know I could have spent more, but for the price it shouldn't have broke after 2 days) there could be a little more quality.Also, the pillow that comes with the bag is a joke, but that really shouldn't be why you are buying the bag in the first place."
5,AWESOME SLEEPING BAG,"This is one of the best sleeping bags I have ever owned. It is real warm, the zipper plow is nice cause it keeps the clothe out of the zipper. The only thing bad about this bag is that it could use a better way to keep it rolled up. I have two of them. It is real nice that you can join two of the sleeping bags together to make one large sleeping bag. This was real nice when me and my wife went camping in Yosemite."
4,Vive Louis Riel!,"Yes, I'm a Franco Manitobain. Yes, I think Louis Riel is a hero ... at least to many in Manitoba. And that's my bias or point of view. So, I was very happy to find this book.I thought the graphics were wonderful. I really like the way Chester Brown accommodated English speaking readers but still made the point that many of the characters were really speaking French -- he used a different font but the text was in English. I thought that was a clever way of solving that problem.It's a great way to learn about history -- through dialog, text, and comic strip drawings.The history itself was fairly good. Although there were a couple of times when I felt that something was being described through the lens of the Anglo government in Ottawa. Also, I would have liked more Métis history in this book."
4,Great read,"This is a great read, fascinating glimpse at an enigmatic figure. A page turner with decent notes at the back (don't you wish movies explained all the liberties they took with their stories?)My only gripe is its readability. This edition is a rather compact trade paperback. It's easy to carry around and read on the streetcar, but that comes at the sacrifice of panel size. You might be squinting at some of the more detailed panes.I would still recommend this book."
5,Arcane yet Awesome,"With absolutely stunning photographs and accurate definitions, this book is a landmark in publishing. The authors have created an illustrated dictionary using state-of-the-art imaging techniques. The nearly 1000 color pictures, the majority photomicrographs, are crisply reproduced. The book's strength is in presentation of details of cellular structure, so important for identifying mosses and their ilk. This book will be useful for years to come. This is not a book for the beginner; without solid training in general botany it is likely to be overwhelming, if not impenetrable. This is a reference book, not a text. For the beginning student of mosses, however, it can be a stepping stone to mastering this fascinating group of land plants. The only caution is for northern hemisphere botanists: almost all the subjects are drawn from the flora of New Zealand. Although the images might illustrate a term well, a North American reader will never encounter most of the species depicted."
4,Solid Album,"He had a strong Whiskey Voice&a way with expressing Himself.I grew up on ""don't Let Your Babies grow up to be Cowboys"" with Willie Nelson.that song was especially Happening when Roger Staurbach was the Dallas Cowboys QB.anyway Waylon was a straight up Artist in His Presentation."
5,The Good Old Outlaws of Country,"This is Waylon before the Dukes of Hazard and all that. This album goes right up there with the Johnny Cash, Hank Williams Sr., and Willie Nelson. Comfort food for the soul when the autotuned, air-tight, over produced light weight rock that passes for country gets to be too much. I'm very sure Hank done 'em this way."
4,A timeless country music album for anyone.,This album is a timeless classic for anyone who loves or even likes country music. A must have for any music connoisseur.
5,BUY THIS CD!,"Lord it's the same old tune --fiddle & guitar. Where do we take it from here? Rhinestone suits & new shiney cars --it's been the same way for years. We need to change.Somebody told me, when I came to Nashville, ""Son, you finally got it made. Ole Hank made it here and we're all sure that you will"" but I don't think Hank done it this way. I don't think Hank done it this way.10 years on the road, making one night stands, speeding my young life away. Tell me one more time just so I'll understand. Are you sure Hank done it this way? Did ole Hank really do it this way?Lord I've seen the world with a 5-piece band looking at the back-side of me. Singing my songs, one of his now and then. But I don't think Hank done 'em this way. I don't think Hank done it this way."
4,An excellent CD that leaves the listener wanting more.,"This CD is the best available Waylon Jennings CD. It is essential to any fan who enjoys Outlaw Country music. However, Waylon Jennings' Honkey Tonk Heroes is a superior CD. I wish this five star CD was still in print. Waylon's Greatest Hits will have to do for now."
3,The Silvery Light of a Dream,"Beach Boys meets the Beach Boys after stepping through a musical rift in the time space continuum that opened in mid '67 while Brian Wilson was tripping out smiley smile style and wigging out about mysterious fires. Together, the two sets of superheros produce formula based psych pop. Oh, but what a wonderful formula it is."
3,Non-nutritious ear candy 2 1/2 stars,"It's a bit misleading to compare groups like this to ""Pet Sounds"", the Beatles, and the Byrds. Yes, there's chimey guitar and organs and bells and whistles. No, there's not distinctive songwriting. There's zero passion on this record. I like what they and their Elephant 6 brethren are doing but these guys and Beulah need a kick in the pants to even approach what Neutral Milk Hotel is doing. Apples--you need some cojones! This record's too twee for my taste, with no standout tracks at all. But it's still more adventuresome than any supposedly ""alternative"" stuff going on these days."
4,3.75 stars,"this one is a little quiet, almost too literally like the 60s pop they love. for some reason it doesn't stand out from the crowd like ""fun trick noisemaker"" does. i prefer their more sonic feel. maybe after a few more listens it'll kick in for me. i really like ""silver chain""."
2,One Great Song Does Not an Album Make,"I bought this album because of ""Seems So,"" and that is still one of my top fifty songs ever. However, the rest disappointed me; it was just as Beatles-derivative, but nowhere near as good. I advise downloading ""Seems So"" somewhere else and not bothering with the rest."
5,"Sturdy, fun, educational!!!","These are nice and thick, so little ones can't bite parts off. They are also patterned on one side, which helps my son recognize which way a letter is supposed to face. He has had these since he was less than a year old and still loves them at 2 1/2. He learned letter recognition with these by the time he was about 15 months. These are really a wonderful, fun way to teach!!!"
4,My daughter loves these,"My daughter has fun sticking these all over the shower wall and along the bath tub and then taking them all down and putting them away. She has used them as teethers as well so some of them are a little gnarled up so if you want to keep them in good shape don't let baby chew on them. For me the price is so good I figured I would just buy another set when she gets over her teething because she loves these for relief she actually goes in the bathroom and points to let me know she wants one and then just chews away nice and happy, no pieces have ever come off so I've never had to worry about choking but I do keep a close eye just in case."
5,such a great book,"everyone in stoneybrook has entered a baking contest but someone is trying to sabotage the different teams and claudia is trying to solve the mystery. Also it's interesting about how claudia has an artistic flair for designing and decorating cakes though they don't taste good at first, but then when they get a recipe of a cake mary anne's mom used to make before she passed away they make that and use one of claudia's beautiful designs and win!"
3,pre-heating,"Another reviewer of Lodge grill/griddle pans suggested pre-heating the pan in a cold oven at 500 degrees before placing it on the burner. Since I've also had problems with cast iron grill/griddle pans heating uneavenly, I'm tempted to try that, but something in my mind tells me that is defeating the purpose. But I'll try that a couple of times and see if it works."
1,Can't rate - never received...,I have waited for nearly 6 weeks for nothing. I'm very disappointed in this shipment and the lack of ability to contact anyone in regards to the missing item.
3,Light NHL Satire,"Fred Stenson's 'Teeth' has all the right stuff for an NHL satire: a henpecked owner, a handcuffed GM, duelling journalists, a struggling team, and a cowardly center who considers his missing tooth a mortal wound and hates hockey. My only complaint is that several characters appear and drop out of the story too fast. Some of the names the author uses are also distractingly silly. While 'Teeth' is no 'Bonfire of the Vanities,' it does store several chuckles among its pages and it's fun for a quick afternoon read."
5,Does Not Disappoint,"Miro has been described as the French Beck, but he has a style of his own. En Plein Vol successfully mixes funk, folk, and whimsy without losing its edge. It's good from the first track to the last. My favorites include the title track, Normalement (Le Mal Est Fait), and Murder. Another good album to check out is La Voix du Vaurien."
2,ALL REMADE SONGS!!,"THIS CD WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,PRETTY MUCH ALL SONGS ARE REDONE SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
3,Not the best of ...,"Unfortunately, there have been left out songs such as Acapulco that is one of their greatest hits. This song made a great impact all over the world, being one of the favourites of the decade in our region."
2,Netgear WG311,It's weak. It was cheap but the signal is not strong and its not that reliable. I think I am just going to buy a 50ft cable.
5,One of the best books on Spiritual Warfare,"This book by Dr. Barnhouse is one of the best I've read on Spiritual Warfare. He covers a broad range of topics including Creation, the Fall of Man, Angels and Demons, our struggle with sin and the eternal state. This is an easy read for any level of Christian. It's quite understandable for a new believer yet still informative to a Seminary graduate.I give it my highest recommendation."
5,Can't go wrong!,"Just ordered my second book...the first one had worn out over the years and was marked up on every page. Donald Grey Barnhouse is one of the most respected theologians of the last century, yet, he is much more than that. He is for the average Christian mind and the unbeliever as well. He explains, defends, and covers all aspects of the subject he is critiquing. He has great insight in the verses that apply to his subject and is interesting, exciting, and reads like a can't-put-it-down book. The most important: He is very accurate. If you want to know how this crazy world,and the people in it,(including you and me)ended up thinking and acting the way we do, as well as, how we relate,or can'r seem to relate to God ...you'll find out in this book. You can't go wrong!"
5,great book,"Wish I had been exposed to this in my teens, rather than secular junk about the spiritual world. Should be read by all christians."
1,Don't be fooled . . . not a true Philippa Carr novel,"Believe this book was published after the author's death, and it should NOT have been published under the name ""Philippa Carr."" The story itself may be fine, but it was ruined for me when I spent the entire book trying to figure out who Sarah's mother was, since I thought this to be the end of the Daughters of England series. IT'S NOT!! It's not related at all!! It made for a very, very disappointing ending to an otherwise perfectly wonderful book series. So if you get this book, pretend it's by ""Victoria Holt"" and you'll enjoy it more!!"
5,LOOK AT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,She is really pretty!!Her hair style is the best i've seen.Her red shirt fits her perfectly!Good toy!!
1,"if you want humble kids, it may help not to buy this.","Bratz dolls are about fashion and I think personally they aren't a good inspiration for kids. If you don't want your kids to grow up to strut down the highschool building talking about how they're better than everyone else, it may help not to buy this. But it may not. But overall, Bratz are weird."
1,!!!NEVRA ÀND FIANNA SUCKS ÀBOUT THEY CLOTHES,i have fianna funk out drama queen she haves the same clothes like the other bartz nevra to that's weard all the bratz must have they one style nevra to she is pretty and fianna to but get your one style stupid bartz i give nevra 1 star and fianna 1 star to
4,A cheetah's review,"Dear Readers,I think this wild safari fiana doll is great.It can take you on a wonderful adventure!There is one problem though.I don't think the manufacturers should make Fiana with a big forehead.That makes her look well not ugly but just weird.But that is the only problem I have with fiana.Other than that everything is perfect.Especially the outfits!Have a good time play ing the wild safari collection!Yours,A bratz doll cheetah"
5,The Health Physics Solutions Manual,"This solutions manual is a well constructed and a valuable companion to Introduction To Health Physics. The manual provides a step-by-step detailed approach to solving complex and thought provoking health physics problems. The authors' use of easy to follow references and equations makes this manual a perfect guide to solve each of these challenging health physics problems.This is a must have reference for Health Physicists regardless of their experince level.

5,Astounding,A beutiful mix of electronic and organic sounds. A strong sense of melody. One of the top 3 of 2002.
4,Much better than Macho Ssssluts!,"This book rocks. I didn't even mind the hetero Frankie and Johnnie, if it was in fact hetero. Dolly was chilling and amusing...very creative, Ms. Califia! I didn't care for the Mercy/No Mercy bit in there...trying to be too clever for my tastes I think. All in all, this book definitely outclasses her Macho Sluts book and is a good purchase...esp. if you can get it for its discounted price on Amazon.Happy reading, girls!"
2,Big disappointment,I got this and another Tai Chi workout years ago by the same instructor and absolutely loved them.. Too bad they were tapes. This one is a DVD and poorly put together.
1,this (stinks),"I bought this product and recieved it in the mail. When I tried to put my CD's in it, the flimsy plastic along the edge broke. If they want to make more sales, they need to use more durable products in the manufacturing!"
2,Could be better,"It's nice to look at. It holds cd's. It just isn't very efficient. It is made to hold 4 cd's total in each sleeve. If you place all 4 cd's in it, they are held so tightly that you can't get one out. If you only place 2 cd's in each sleeve, they fall out. Like I said, it's pretty. I like the color. That's about it, though."
4,It works!,"At first, I didn't know that I needed one of these to use my old turntable with my new amplifier. But when I found it, I ordered it, and had it plugged in 3 days later. For once, a simple fix for a potentially difficult electronic issue."
5,It did the job.,"I looked everywhere for a pre-amp that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. Hell, all I wanted to do was listen to my records. This thing did what it was meant to do. Nothing went wrong, so there's nothin' to complain about."
1,Stops Working After a Few Months,"Like many others who have mentioned, this preamp stops working after a few months. One of my channels stopped working and the humm would not go away."
1,Failure,It simply did not work when it arrived. There is not even a light switch to indicate the unit was on. Disappointing.
1,Disappointing,"Used this unit with a well grounded turntable but still experienced a very audible hum. Incidentally, the turntable was previously used with an ""xitel inport"" and exhibited absolutely no hum so my sense is that the Pyle Preamp is the problem and not the turntable itself. Repackaged it and put on the shelf. Go the xitel route and save the dollars and grief!"
1,Stay Away!,"We had this plugged in for less that 1/2 hour and the adapter burned up! It actually melted on the sides...it's a good thing we smelled it, or it may have stared a fire! It was too hot to touch. We never did get it to work before it burned up :("
4,"great, inexpensive product",I purchased this with the intent of transferring my LP's to CD. I have no complaints about the product - works great!!
2,Does not work well,"I have bought 3 of these , 2 are still in use. The most recent purchase has no left side audio the other ones work after some serious fiddling I got the other 2 working. I would say spend a little more and get a more quality made preamp"
3,Not enough amplification,"Most modern stereo systems will require pre-amps so you can ""hear"" the old-school turntables. It works, but fails to boost the signal to the level I was hoping for. Place more in series? Maybe that's an idea. But then I realized playing records are a pain in the @#$, plus records produce low quality sounds. I got this to show my 8 year old daughter what old technology used to be like. RIP records."
3,"Good, but obviously not the best","Works quite well, be sure to ground the record player to the side of the box at one of the screws. A little grainy at high sounds but great piece of equipment to get my record player working again."
3,50/50 review....,"Pyle phono preamp is fine. Clean sound. Gets the job done without any problems.If your new audio system dosen't have magnetic phono inputs then this is theunit your looking for. (I just used the CD Audio input! Easy!)However, the China made 12VDC/100MA wall wart died just past the 30 day mark.Good thing I keep spare warts around, had the exact powerpak needed, that andthe fact the Pyle didn't need anything fancy power wise.I would send the dead pak back to you Amazon but it's just not worth the postage."
3,Works as advertised,"Works, however it has a loose ground wire that is not mentioned in instructions. If this is not connected you will get feedback noise in your recording. The wire should be longer or with identification. Very inconvenient."
1,Do Not Buy!!! Spend the extra cash to get something better,"I really should have read more reviews before buying this, just like a lot of other people have said the left channel slowly went bad, didn't really notice it on older records but on ones where it certain sounds are separated between the left and right channels it became very obvious. After that it just slowly started to die altogether, trust me spend the extra cash and get something nicer it will be worth it in the end.Also don't come with a place for the ground wire, ended up having to connect it to one of the main screws."
5,This Pyle pre-amp gets the job done!,"My turntable had a magnetic needle cartridge and I couldn't get any volume for recordings out of it when hooked to my PC. So I bought this Pyle pre-amp. Hooking it up is a breeze and it amplifies the signal perfectly so I now get excellent recordings. I've already copied over 60 of my LP's with this super device. I highly recommend this Pyle pre-amp. Good price, strong, well designed metal case, made to last."
3,It gets the job done,"Like I said It gets the job done. It amplifies the sound but there is a lot of humming and noise that it makes in the process. Its not the stereo, its brand new, but it could be the record player. I don't think so because it worked on the phono input of my old stereo.Like I said it works but I might invest in something a little nicer to crank up the old Whitesnake vinyl with."
3,"Does the job -- lacks ""ground"" connection","I've purchased pre-amps before, so I should have known to look for the one feature this product is missing: a grounding terminal! Since most turntables plug into the wall with a 2-prong plug, there's also a ground strap which usually plugs into the mixer, amplifier or pre-amp. The model has no ground strap, so I'm nervous that I may start to hear some buzzing in the system. I'll just have to cross my fingers..."
4,works just fine,This preamp works great for the money. I have had no problems with it and it boosts the sound plenty so i can listen to all my records. The only thing i could ask for would be an on/off switch. Other then that this is a nice little addition to any set up.
4,Cheaper than buying a USB turntable,"Despite some of the reviews I decided to buy this little device anyway. I have had nothing but good luck so far. I probably have used this over two dozen times already for hours on end. Very simple to hook up: plug in the transformer, connect it to the amplifier, and then connect the RCA cables. I use the Input Deluxe system for recording my old LP's which has RCA connections to the USB device. It is far cheaper than buying a new USB turntable."
5,Phono Preamp,"Received fine, easy to connect. New amplifiers don't have a connection for phonograph records. This preamp allows me to play my old time favorites, and old time performers no longer avaiable"
4,"Works Fine, But The Diagram Is Backwards","This simple gadget does what it was designed to do. At first, though, I thought it was dead. Only after ignoring the diagram that came with it (the only instructions, BTW) and plugged the RCA cords in from the opposite sides, did it work. In other words, the ""Phono"" side went to the amp, and the amp side went to the turntable. Confusing to explain, but if yours is DOA; try it, it might work. It did for me, and John Lennon is wailing."
3,Defective Power Supply,The Preamp worked well as soon as I was able to supply 12 vdc to it. The included power supply was defective and provided no output voltage. I was in need to use the preamp without further delay so borrowed a 12 vdc power supply for another system to get things going. So I'm satisfied with the preamp but disappointed that it was lacking as a complete functioning package.
2,This unit doesn't have a grounding point...,Ran around trying to ground the turntable... thought this thing came with an input for grounding my turntable because some other mini-preamps made by the same company do. Boo.
3,Just ok,It did allow more sound to come out of the record player but it still does not get that loud.
1,Faulty transformer,I used the product for just one day and the transformer started melting. I had to stop using it product because I was concerned about it causing a fire.
3,Adequate,"For the price it's ok. Even when grounded to unit, there's light rumble generated via the amp. Software didn't remedy it completely. You get a serviceable unit at a cheap price and that's it."
4,Connecting turntable to newer amp,"This pre-amp is an effective and inexpensive solution to the problem of not being able to hook up a turntable to newer amplifiers that no longer contain phono inputs or pre-amps. An on/off switch would be nice, although I worked around the ""power on"" issue by plugging it into the switched power plug in the back of the amp. Therefore, the pre-amp is only powered on when the amp is turned on."
1,Double plus un-good.,Stopped working after a few months of light usage. I would avoid this product and get a better rated one that has a grounding terminal on it.
4,preamp is perfect but not the charger,Preamp is perfect but not the charger that died in two minutes after i connect it on the wall. The preamp sound has excellent quality.
4,"Works well, good price.",This works nicely for ripping vinyl to mp3. My only real gripe is that there is no grounding point so I made one and grounded it to the metal back on my computer. That eliminated the humming problem.While this is not an audiophile grade component it is fantastic for the price and works well for what I bought it for.
1,Unreliable unit,"I purchased this pre-amp for my phono. It works. For me who doesn't care too much to the quality, the sound quality is ok. However, the left channel stopped working in less than 3 months. Now I'm seriously consider a much better unit."
4,Outstanding production and very effective singing,"The La Scala production is gorgeous and effectively captured on this DVD. The singing is always good and sometimes very sensitive and gripping; the conducting is superb, vigorous and also nuanced and delicate. The video filming is especially effective in giving enough cut away shots so that you can really appreciate the beauty of the sets (shades of Fragonard, etc. very appropriate--although why the mosque at Cordoba shows up in one backgound painting is hard to say). All the singers except for Carlo Guelfi, who is very assured throughout, seem to be warming up during their first appearances but overall their committment and acting is effective and moving. The subtitles are amazingly literal so that at times they are very silly, but at least it teaches you just how basic opera librettos often are. Color gorgeous, sound excellent. Highly recommended for any fan of this beautiful and tuneful opera."
2,DULL,"Many years ago, I owned a recording of Adriana Lecouvreur and I think I enjoyed it enough to purchase this new DVD of it. Boy, was I wrong or awfully forgetful. This truly has to be the dullest opera that I have ever witnessed or have ever heard. It truly is a ""one tune"" score with no exciting arias, ensembles or choruses.The signers come-off as interesting as dish-water--not even Olga Borodina seemed to be too inspired. Dessi has always bored me to tears and in this opera, I almost broke down in hysterical sobs. Larin appears and sounds like he just wondered in off the streets.The production, I guess was nice being what the producer had to work with.Buy this DVD only if you absolutely ADORE Verismo operas."
4,Lives up to its title.,This is a rather unique book on warehouse design in that it combines some basic warehouse design content with highly detailed information related to costs and time standards. It's this cost and time standards content that sets this book apart from any other warehouse design book I have encountered. Certainly a valuable resource for anyone with responsibilities for running or designing a warehouse.
5,Information overload,Filled with useful standards and cost guides to help with the design of a warehouse or other storage facility. Well written and informative. Well worth the price.
3,Costly book with limited information,"Although the information contained in the book is useful, it is not comprehensive. The price it sells for is excessive for the amount of information provided."
5,Return of guitar-based rock'n'roll that is a must-buy.,"WOW. That is the 1st word that came to my mouth when I listened to EXTENDED PLAY, the amazing self-produced rookie release of Raleigh's own Drifting Through. Showing experience beyond their years, band members Everett Bolton, Randall Kirsch and Jay Doyle have created an incredibly versatile album that is different in spots but always entertaining. From the mystical beginning of ""The Ride"" through the pounding intensity of ""Hatteras"", Drifting Through eschews the ways of many of todays ""hot"" bands, who feel the only way to play good music is to put a different insturment than anyone else in a band and call it ""alternative"". These guys show their musical skill and ability by rocking out with the simplest of setups, 2 guitars, a base, and a drum. For anyone who fondly remembers simpler times when guitar-based rock was the way to go, EXTENDED PLAY by Drifting Through is a must have."
4,"Impressive, leaves you looking for more.","Music is processed somewhere in the deep recesses of one's skull, open only to those closest and the occasional psychiatrist. The point at which the bass line thumps, the lyrics explode, the electric guitar borders on pure anger, and the drums meet your body's rhythm, is that unexplainable concoction called groove. DT's highpoints (Doyle's solo accompanied by Kirsch's vocals on Washed Away for example) on Extended Play are exactly that; a weird firing of synapses that is nearly impossible to describe.Buy the CD.Turn the volume up to deafening levels.Close your eyes.Trust me you'll understand, or go deaf trying.Their second album, with an even fuller sound, will surely prove this point........"
4,a great listen,"I enjoyed the audio versions of Lois McMaster Bujold's books so much that I started looking for others by the same reader (Michael Hansen). I had never read the book and wondered if it would be hard to grasp audio only. Not so! The plot starts to thicken right away and the characters keep you in the book even cut up into ""drive sized"" segments (I listen in the car on my way to work). I found myself driving home the long way or going on unnecessary errands to finish up a segment/chapter. I finally gave up and brought it in the house to listen to the last few cassettes in a long [session] because I couldn't stand the suspense of figuring out ""who done it"" A great mystery/slice of gritty life book and the audio tape is superb!! Plan a long vacation drive so you can listen to it in one sitting."
2,Deceptive Sizing,"In the twentieth century, and before, cast iron pans had the size stamped on them which told you the diameter of the cooking surface. Twenty-five years ago I bought the Lodge 10SK which is a 12"" skillet with a 10"" inside cooking diameter. OK.With this skillet marked 14SK the inside cooking surface is only 12"" and it should be marked 12SK. They deceptively flared out the sides to get an overall top diameter of 15 1/4"" as a selling point. This isn't very helpful to my pork chops being 36% less space than I thought I was buying. I'd watch out for the 10SK too.I guess to get a real #14 cast iron skillet, I need to get a Griswold.HilditchPS: It weighs 10 lbs."
5,No kitchen should be without one,"Regardless of size, a good iron skillet should be one of the first things anyone buys to fill their kitchen. They're useful in so many ways, not the least of which being that it will last forever no matter what you do to it (unless you're truly insane). Put it on the stove, in the oven, on a campfire, in the dishwasher, run it over with a truck, shoot at it, it won't break. The handle won't fall off or need repair, the coating won't come off (it's not coated, of course), none of it. These things are how they define durable.There are two problems that any chef worth their weight in ham will not consider a problem: One is that the handle IS iron, so you will want to have a potholder or whatever to grip it. The other is that it is not coated with teflon. This will help it cook, but it will also make it stick. Some butter or oil in the pan, or even Pam, will prevent that.Do you have one? No? Pick a size and order it. Now. Or you stink as a cook."
4,Old fashion cooking,"The lodge is a very heavy skillet. It is almost 15"" on the inside and requires a large burner for heating. Howver, it does cook very evenly. Clean up is simple, just make sure you have a large enough space for storage."
5,Cookware for life!,"I am absolutely sold on cast iron. I have 4 different size skillets plus covered casserole, fryer, dutch oven. I really enjoy using this giant one (pick your size for your crowd). I pre-heat it in a 350 degree oven for stove top cooking. I bake coffee cakes, corn bread and fritta's in it. It's roomy for grilling sandwiches. I have also broiled and ""oven fried"" meats in this skillet. I love to bake one pot meals (casseroles from cheese to rice)in the dutch ovens. Wet roasting is nice too but the pots do need to be re-reasoned after. I agree with two other reviews 1) clean up while still hot on the burner 2) no tomatoes! (acidic foods destroy the seasoned coating). Making gravy in these pans really cleans them up. I will never ""need"" to buy another set of cookware!"
4,A truely creepy book!,This book is a must read for King fans. This book is page turner and will keep on the edge of your seat from the begining to the end. A really creepy novel!!!!!!!!
4,Disturbing Novel Of Pure Terror,"What I expected from Pet Sematary was a novel in which dead animals come alive and reak havoc on the humans around them. Not so. Instead, Pet Sematary is a truly disturbing horror novel in which Stephen King brings out the bad side to life, and how a normal family can suddenly become the gateway to evil. I enjoyed the novel very much. It is another excellent King novel in which he develops great characters and places them in a story that could only come from his superb mind."
5,PET SEMATARY is King's best to date!,"PET SEMATARY was not just another great horror novel I was reading, but it was also emotional. Several disturbing mature subjects are talked about in this book, especially ""why people die."" The scariest parts in this book were when Louis brings his daughters cat back from the dead, and when he brings his dead son back from the dead. I didn't go to sleep after reading this!"
1,Did not know this was a Book Club Edition,Very upset when I opened the package. I decided to keep the book anyway even though I wanted to return it.
2,Pet Sematary was a bit corny,"I listened to the audio version of Pet Sematary on my commute to and from work recently. I enjoyed it for the most part, as there were some dramatic moments and it kept the drive interesting.But in giving it a rating I find I can't give it more than two stars because the underlying Pet Sematary story was so corny and unbelievable that it doesn't deserve anything higher.If I were choosing again and there was a better choice available I would pass on Pet Sematary.Looking back on it, it was enjoyable in a corny sort of way, but a total waste of time."
2,Horror? Are You Sure?,"I was really disappointed in this one; what with all the hype about it being the scariest King novel ever written, I thought it would at least scare me from getting up in the middle of the night. Yes, there's a cemetery that brings things back to life; yes, the zombies that return come back creepy; but no, this was not nearly a terrifying read. It surprises me greatly that this book pretends to belong to the horror genre, because really, I don't think even my little sister would get the creeps out of this one, and she can't sleep at night when I'd put on Beheaded by The Offspring in the car on the way back from school."
2,not enough,"a family moves to a place near a pet sematary in the woods. animals buried there do not necessarily stay dead. they come back....different. the family carries on like families do untill ""the incident"". an incident that makes someone consider the pet sematary in a new way. there are some lovely descriptions here, perhaps K's best and darkest. and the plot isn't bad. but it's not enough. too much about ordinary family life and stuff like that. the suspence suffers and the plot develops too slowly. frankly i can't see the reason for the book's popularity. you can do much better with SK easily. this is in fact probably the book SK has worked out the poorest. unnecessary dwelling, irrelevant sidetracks, etc."
3,Don't Read!,"I love much of King's work. Actually I read everything that King wrote up to this book. Soon after Pet Sematary was published King wrote Cujo, another major don't read and put me off of King for many years.Why? These two books aren't especially scary, what they are is UGLY, so ugly in fact that the only word that comes to mind in description is ""evil"". If you liked Nevil Schute's ""On The Beach"" you MIGHT like these two books, because all three of these books end without hope of any kind, and the trip isn't so great either.In all honesty Cujo and Sematary are well written and characters are believeably drawn, but King builds up only to break down. I have read literally thousands of books over the years but for a worse feeling at the end of a book I have to go back to ""A Mill On The Floss"" or something similar. Be warned."
3,You have to wait,"I read this book and as I got halfway through I thought that it was extremely boring. The book finally gets exciting at the end of the story. Although the main part of the book takes forever to get through, the end is worth waiting for"
5,One of the best horror novels EVER!,"I don't know why I put off reading this book for so long...wait, yes I do--the movie scared the crap out of me! While shopping at a used book store I came across a first-edition copy of Pet Sematary and couldn't snatch it off the shelf quick enough.There are many elements that make Pet Sematary work so well. Besides being well-written, great character development, wonderful pace, and no plot holes; this novel plays on many fears of the normal every day person. Many parts of this book sent chills down my spine (and that is really saying something from me).This is one of the best horror books ever written in my opinion (and probably many others as well). If you haven't read this book yet, you are really missing out! Absolutely a MUST read!"
4,Dark Power,"Even though at times this book seems overly influenced by television culture, in that the characters and things they do often appear culled from sitcom and other TV situations, and has perhaps too many goofy high school humor intrusions, it still has a powerful body of dark human dreams and emotions that wrenches the gut. Mr. King has fashioned a relatively simple story from the plight of a single family spiralling, like the arrangement of tombstones in the Sematary circling inward to the unknown deep within a Celtic spiral, into the depths of primal survival emotion and nightmare. This book is a bed of childhood terror and debilitating anxiety, and possibly a portrait of a man and wife who took too long to acknowledge the pain and horror that has a spot reserved in each of us, and is present beneath each of our footfalls as we walk across this world."
2,Not Scary,"This was my first Stephen King book. I remember I was in middle school when I checked it out from a library. I was looking to get scared (which I am rather easily), and this book did not deliver.Although it was quite some time ago that I read this book, I remember its problem was that nothing happened throughout the majority of the book. There was build up here and there, but it always fizzled out. The book just seemed to go on and on and on. Little 13-year-old me was not frightened or amused.As far as I can tell, Stephen King is over-rated. Now in my mid 20's, I periodically return to him, but have always been dissapointed. His stories are page turners and his characters are interesting, but he seems to have a habit of falling short.If you want a ""junk food"" read then go ahead and read this book. Some of the character development is good and it is a fast read --- Just don't expect it to actually fill you up or satisfy you!"
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Reading all of Stephen King's booksWhat impressed me: I feel like I'm constantly repeating myself when it comes to Stephen King, but the man knows how to write characters. Whenever I read one of his novels that I've already seen a movie version of, I'm always impressed by the psychological depth of his main character, which never translates to the screen and Pet Sematary is the same. Louis's inner thoughts and workings are far more important in this novel than any of the scares.What disappointed me: There was an extremely long build up before things started getting spooky. While the ending was pure horror gold, I had trouble getting there because the beginning dragged so much.Recommended: Eh. Nothing horrific in this novel that you won't find in the movie, so only big fans of the story may be interested in getting to know Louis Creed's mind better."
3,Pet Sematary,"I just got finished with the book and it didnt really get exiting until the last like 40 pages, but the beginning mainly tells you about the Sematary the Micmac burying ground and what people use those places for. I havent read alot of Stephen Kings books, actually this is the first one i have read through all of the way, and i am not sure if this is the scariest one but it was a creepy book, like you dont know whats going to happen next. But i think its a good book but its definetly not the best book i have ever read. (at least it not as good as R. L. Stine or Harry Potter!)"
3,"Pretty good book, a little to much detail.","Stephen King really gets you excited about this book really quick. But as I got to the middle of the book it started to get less exciting. Then, at the end of the book it becomes exciting again. Overall, it's a pretty good book."
2,Not as good as I expected...,"Being one of the most famous books S. King has ever written, & since the back of my book said that this book was creepy enough to make S. King scared - I decided to give this book a try...Personally, I don't feel that the story was as scary as all that buildup promised. Also, logic doesn't seem to be the story's strong point: for example - if the force of the burial ground was THAT strong - why didn't it attract Judd to bury Norma there, while it was strong enough for the cat?"
3,"Pretty good. Not his best, not his worst","Let me just start off saying: I'm a HUGE King fan..BUT, in this case, I didn't really enjoy this one as much as some others. It starts off FANTASTIC and really has the potential to be a great book. But after a while (mainly after Gage dies)it just becomes, well, STUPID! I couldn't put the book down though...it was a pretty good read for the most part. The ending, although not Kings worst, is just strange and dumb. Not his best, not his worst. 50/50 recommendation. Some may like it, some may not."
2,One of King's lesser works,"""Pet Semetary"" starts out very spooky, and then about half way through it loses its way and becomes kind of a freak show. The plot turns on extended action by one character (the father of the dead child) that just does not seem convincing. After seeing what the semetary does to the unfortunate creatures buried there, I found it unlikely that even in his profound grief the father would try to resurrect his son. King has written some great books, but this one simply doesn't measure up."
4,Great Book for Cheap!,I only gave this book 4 stars because it didn't come with a dust jacket. Other than that I am completely satisfied! Great hardcover book for a very reasonable price!
4,Pet Semetary,"Pet Semetary was a pretty good book. It was good for a while but the end was kind of stupid because you had to use your imagination to know what happen,. Besides the ending it was ok. I would suggest this book to someone with a lot of time in their hands. Stephen King is one messed up guy."
1,Disappointed,"I've heard that this is supposed to be a really good book, and was recommended to read it. Upon purchasing the book, and reading that it is supposed to be the best he ever wrote, I started to read the book with minimal expectations. Honestly, I believe Edgar Alan Poe wrote a better story with the ""Fall Of The House Of Usher."" This was a very disappointing book. Out of 500+ pages, maybe 20 were halfway decent."
1,As bad as the movie,I thought this was one of the worst books I have ever read. Like reading about a movie. It's the only King book I have read I am sure Some must be better.
1,Over-rated?,"I think Stephen King is the most over-rated author in the universe. I've found that the movies adapted from his books are better, which I find unusual since the books are usually better. I remember reading this book in one sitting because I couldn't believe it was so bad. I didn't even find it scary. But how can you write gory and scary scenes as well as the movies? Is this a trait of the genre? I've read 'Carrie' and 'The Stand' which I thought were better. Again though, the movies were better. I guess I'm really not a fan of horror novels, so this whole review is suspect. I've never read any other horror author."
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"When I got Pet Sematary, I thought it would be as good as The Shining. It wasn't. What I bought was boring, slow moving, and hardly scary. The only real scares come in the last 30 pages of the book. NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL THEN!"
4,A semetary you don't ever wanna have to visit.,"Pet semetary is one of the more popular novels by stephen king and it's easy to see why, It's brillant. Alot of people think that this was the last truely great novel he wrote. I don't share that opinion, in mine that position is reserved for his 1991 novel needful things. With that said pet semetary is original, intelligent and scary. By the late 80's king's ideas were virtually untouchable. No horror writer could test his imagination. I give pet semetary my highest reccomendation as it easily earns a spot in my top 10."
