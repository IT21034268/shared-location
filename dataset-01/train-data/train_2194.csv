4,Good!,"I too was very surprised at this straight to DVD movie. I watched it with my 3 year old this weekend and found it to be funny and cute. I definitely recommend it, especially for little ones who love Cinderella."
1,"No More Remakes Of Disney Movies"" They Are All -1","All of The Limited Issue dvds that were made were excellent. I give all of them a 10+. All the remakes listed here and many more. children should not even watch half of them. Starting with, Cinderella, Lady & The Tramp.Toy Story, Toy Story 2,Tarzan, Snow white,Beauty & the Beast A disaster dvd.Little mermaid.ON & ON & ON Are no Good. I give them all a -1 No more remakes they stink. Some I would never let my children see. That's how bad they are. I give all these new dvds A -1. Oh well Disney has over 35.0000 Factories all over the world making these 2nd rate dvds to sell. making more money by having the dvds made overseas.Still using the Disney Logo & Buena Vista.Made In the USA."
3,wow . . . .,"So yeah, I haven't seen this movie. I probably will and it probably won't be terribly stupid as some sequels are, but this pains me. Greatly. Cinderella two was not the greatest disney sequel. The Little Mermaid 2 and Mulan 2 were both better. So why is it that this one get's a 3? Why should any of them get a 3? If anyone from disney reads this--PICK ANOTHER FAIRY TALE!!! There's lots out there that haven't been disneytized. Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltzkin, and then there are the ones from other coutnries that western europe and Grimm and stuff. China--like Mulan--good movie. Make something new and original again. Please!!! Parents, babysitters, and teachers who have to watch these things beg you!!"
2,Disney still can't get it right,"I miss the days of Disney classics with good storytelling and good themes. Unfortunately, Disney hasn't told a good animated story since Tarzan. Pixar does it well, but Disney insists on recycling their old classics in the way of straight to DVD movies. Cinderella III is just another sophomoric recycling of a Disney classic. The plot was unbelievable and silly (how could the Fairy Godmother be so careless?), the characters sound like every other animated character, the songs were generic Broadway and all sound the same, and why do the stepsisters have such beautiful singing voices? In the original Cinderella, they couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. Did their tone-deafness all of a sudden disappear? If you have children, this may amuse them, although this no where near captures the spirit of the original. The quality of this is no greater than a Saturday morning cartoon."
1,My 5 year old cried when watching this one,"My 5 year old watched this movie, as it was rented for her. She loved the first one, she thought the second one was OK, but she really did not like this one. Mostly because it was a negative tone, they didn't get married, have the happily ever after, etc, etc...She started crying after awhile, and told me she didn't want to watch it anymore, and we sent it back to Blockbuster after about just 35 minutes watched or so. I put on the original one (which we own), and she was OK again, but she most certainly did not like this one.If you have really young girls who are into the princess thing, they may not like this, since it somewhat ruins or at a minimum brings down what little girls have in their heads as fantasy from Princess Land. :)"
2,Don't spend your money,"I not only grew up on Cinderella, but it was the ending of my wedding video and when my marriage broke up I watched it every day for goodness knows how long. I was extremely disappointed. The voice of Cinderella is extremely similar to the original, but the singing is no where near the same talent. Only two blue birds and Jacque and Gus gus appear (forget about any of the other characters they never appear), and Anestasia gets a conscious? Are you kidding me? My children loved it, but actually prefer the original (they have good taste.) I should have rented it first to decide if it was worth paying over $20.00. In this case absolutely not. Find a boot leg."
1,"Everyone is fawning over the new sequel, as usual...*yawns*","This is about Cinderella going back in time, hence ""what if the slipper didn't fit?"". It ""answers"" a lot of questions that you didn't ask. This was an insult to the original Cinderella in short. If this were truly all that great, it would have:1: been released in theatres by disney2: would have made a killing in sales3: would have TONS of toys and commercials based on itBut since it doesn't... You have to wonder, despite all the reviews, why it doesn't attract more attention than it does. This is a typical disney sequel folks, so that means that you have to sift through the reviews and use your common sense.Amy, 10"
1,Cinderella 3,"This is another move along with Open Season, ..we did not receice.. dissapointmt to the max"
1,Terrible!!!,"I ordered this item from Jennifer Hale on Jan. 1st, but I did not receive it as of February 1. In addition, no reply to my twice e-mails. I lost money and time. How do I get a refund? Unpleasant.. Terrible.."
1,My four year old neice may like it but I won't !,"I despise Disney sequels because there is no need for these movies. Why can't they make something original. I've seen a few good disney sequels (emphasis on few)! If they are gonna remake any movie it should be the ""Black Cauldron"". That movie wasn't very good to begin with. I recommend Narnia the Lion the witch and the wardrobe over this movie. This movie is just the original Cinderella in reverse. Geez this is reminisent of the little Mermaid II return to the sea. Come on, Cinderella III a twist in time geez where did they get their stories from a fanfiction site. Does happily ever after mean anything to you people at Disney."
4,Sweet film,"The product itself arrived on time, and as for the actual film, I enjoyed it. I don't think Cinderella really needed a sequel, but either way, it's watchable. I liked seeing more of Prince Charming and seeing how strong their love really was."
4,A good lesson for little girls..............,"I found this movie to be an interesting counterpart to the original - which I loved as a child and still as an adult. I found the story line interesting - Cinderella didn't rely on or even think about contacting the Fairy God Mother to get her out of the situation. With the help of her friends (granted they were mice & birds) she figured out how to resolve 'the problem' presented to her via her step-mother. The movie plants a good seed that we females should not rely on 'others' (i.e. the knight in shinning armor or the prince) to save us --- we need to be able to save ourselves for ourselves - that we have the inner strength to do so at our disposal. Doing so, we become a stronger person and more of a partner to the male we choose to love when we become adults."
1,Did not meet expectations.,"If you want yoga positures, forget this CD. It has no yoga. Not sure what you would call this CD. Lots of talking."
5,Michelle Lemay's Spirit Flow,"Great stress relief from the total body stretch. The title is perfect. I find after each session I do feel more ""Alive in my body/!"" The only issue I have is that at the beginning of the complete workout, on my copy of the DVD, the first inhale movement, audio and visual is missing."
4,Fun romp down memory lane,"I saw all of these movies back when I was a kid. While some of them (Elvira) have lost something with age, the others have not. I especially loved Transylvania 6-5000 since now I know the actors in it better. I had completely forgotten Geena Davis was in it! Well worth the cost even if I never watch them again."
1,Save Your Money,"Just received two of these. Yes, how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it. The quality of the casing is really poor. The plastic is very flimsy feeling. The labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box. They show signs of just simply being really old.The instructions are written in many languages which is fine, but there are things they fail to tell you. I also ordered the Juice AA 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead. The charger blinks red with those batteries, but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means.If you go to the juicebattery website, they do not mention this product anywhere. Not even when you search for it. A good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product. The company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now.As with many things, made in CHINA!I got a few more days yet before I need to return them via Amazon's return policy which as we all know, ROCKS!"
2,It works,"The charger supports various formats of batteries and gets them charged, eventually ;) It would be nice if the charging worked quicker, but other than that it is a decent product."
1,Weak cup of Coffee,I was very excited about getting this machine only to discover that all varieties of K-Cups that I ordered produced one of the weakest cups of coffee that I ever had. I was able to return it but could not return the 100 Kcups that I purchased with it. Very disappointing.
3,Mixed results,Tried it on 5 different tanks/ponds. More effective on smaller tanks than larger. Very effective on my indoor aquariums (5 gal or smaller). Good on my two smaller fountains / ponds (> 20 gal). Results usually seen within 36 hours. No effect on my 50 gallon patio pond. Have tried as directed (one application per week). Have tried doubling the dose. Have tried increasing frequency of dosing to 2x's wk. Even completely drained and replaced with aged water including reco'd dose. Still greenish and cloudy. I have good filtration with a strong submersible pump that provides more than adequate circulation. Local temps during this time range from 40 to 70 degrees. Some sun followed by days of cloudiness. Hardly the kind of exposure that would normally foster high algae growth. Stumped as to why it works so well on smaller indoor and outdoor tanks but not on a 50 gal pond.
3,Works on my little pond,"I have a new pond, and start to see algae to cloud the water after just one week in the sun. At first, I put in the right dosage. The 2nd day, the water is still green and cloudy, but rather more brown (the color of the extract). I put in the same amount and the water became clear on the 3rd day. There is still algae on the liner and rocks, but water is clear (still a little brown). So, I'm happy. Just hope it can last 4 weeks or more because it's not cheap.Update: one week later, green water is back and worse. Used the extract 3 days in a roll, and it didn't help or maybe even worse. could algae be feeding on the barley and peat extract? Strange. I will try pond bacteria next."
3,"Are any facts in a movie accurate? Well, some, but not all.","I would caution individuals to be wary of receiving historical information from a movie. Many individuals have rightly stated that Oliver Stone, as usual, changed the facts to conform with his vision of the world. With that said, it was interesting, even if many facts were untrue, to see how Hollywood interprets Reagan. Coldly, I'd argue. Reagan is portrayed as an unintelligent and uninterested president. Such a characterization is unfair, especially in light of the recent publications of Ronald Reagan's collection of letters demonstrating that he was a man of ideas, and this explains why he won every election in a landslide.I felt that this movie gave the impression that our democratic system was being challenged and was in danger of falling into chaos. Historians would likely have a different perspective...Michael"
2,Poor content and misrepresentation of the players,I don't think the documental is representative of President Reagan and Vice-President Bush characters. I was expecting something with much more quality in content. I would definitely do not recommend it. Is not worth it!
2,Would... you... like... to... surf... the... internet... ?,"If so, be prepared to do a bit of tap, tap, tapping of the fingers. I love my DS, and around 5 years ago, this would have been a decent mobile browser. But today even the most minor websites have lots of data and images to load, all of which will bring your surfing experience to a near standstill. I don't think this is the result of too-high expectations, either. After all, the very first page that you'll see when starting the browser lists Nintendo's home page as a suggested link; but that site is almost completely unusable using this platform, something I think is a little embarrassing for Opera and Nintendo.Bottom line, the only practical use for this is checking e-mail and perhaps a few blogs, and that's really all there is. The next DS should be a bit more powerful and hopefully that'll bring a truly great mobile net surfing experience to the masses. Wait till then."
4,A whole lot more than expected,"I will make this review a short one. This is because I am writting it from the very product I review (actually, I am even using the stylus to write).I just bought my DS browser yesterday and I can say it is a very cool thing. I genuinely love this this thing! It is simple enough to use and is rather functional. Now, I must confess that it does have its flaws, but they are far outweighted by the positive aspects of it.I have been able to read news, check my e-mail, browse amazon.com, and surf quite a few others things with great ease.I must accept, though, that this browser has some limitations: no audio, no video, no flash and some heavier-than-usual load times (although they are not as bad as some might say).Having said all of the above, I do recommend getting this great product, as it certainly delivers what one expects and is great fun to use."
2,*** WAY TOO SLOW -- NOT RECOMMENDED! ***,"Even with broadband (not like you can use it any other way...) this browser is way, way, way, WAY too slow. I'm returning mine. No need for a review. You can read other people's reviews if you're that curious.Trust me, it doesn't matter how well designed it is. (It kind of is.) It is unusable. Remember 56Kbps dialup modems via phone landlines? Well, the internet is different today; pages are much more complex.Anyway, remember 56Kbps and how slow that was? I swear this seems about a quarter of that speed. I don't know how fast it really is, but with today's more complex websites and the DS being not that fast with wireless data in the first place, 1/4 the speed of dialup may even be generous!"
2,Not as convenient as you'd think,"I purchased this item on impulse and it served as a good reminder that not every piece of technology that is released is worth its weight in gold. The Nintendo DS Lite Browser does a minimum job of surfing the web and checking web based e-mail but that's about where the convenience ends...and it's not really that efficient at doing that. You're still not able to access video (streaming or otherwise), there's no javascript support or flash media. Even with images disabled the load times are horrendus and the browser is prone to lock up quite often over the simplest of task. There's too many other options available for mobile wireless access to justify buying this product. I love my Nintendo DS for gaming but when it comes to web browsing I think I'll look elsewhere."
4,Works for the basics!,"If you're expecting magic speeds, design brilliance, and the ability to watch Youtube videos, then you probably shouldn't be looking at this. However, in the absence of a smart phone or laptop, this device is more than adequate to check your e-mail, read the news, and maybe poke around on Facebook a little. They've created an interface that works quite well for the device, and that's what you need. (This is especially great for traveling, as then, if worse comes to worst, you can always play Pokemon during your two hour layover, time sitting during the rainforest's enthusiastic daily rain that made you reluctant to bring your laptop, etc.)"
1,Are you kidding?,"bought it and took it back to eb games next day. pointless. considering how difficult it is to get the ds online with it's crappy WEP only (when nintendo can do an update but they don't care and don't want to), the browser seems like insult to injury with it's $30 price tag. you gotta be kidding? it's not a game, it's not worth $30, it's an update or value added NOT a release. nintendo is acting like microsoft (with the high failure rate of xbox 360s) and just trying to do as little possible to improve on a negative on this product line."
1,"don'tt buy this product, not worth it","this product is definitely not worth the money,i bought it months ago, and have never been able to figure it outwhat a waste of money"
3,it works...for some things...slowly,i kinda knew what i was in for when i bought this. it's cool and clever and does what it's supposed to do. but it's reeeeeeeeally sloooooooooooow.
3,Pain in the A$$,I like it to a point. I think that they should have maid it compatible with the original DS. I had to upgrade to the lite DS (witch I dont like as much) just to use it. If Nintendo was smart at all they would have made it compatible with the original. I am highly upset about that..
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"DO NOT BUY THIS! i recently bought this item only to take it home and realize that it barely works at all. i bought it knowing that the connection speed was slow and that i would not be able to watch videos, but i thought as long as i could check my e-mail out and about it would be worth the price. low and behold, even reading e-mail was too much for this little puppy to handle. i tried to open a page with more than one photo and it ran out of memory. even wikipedia proved to be too much with all of the links and images. you might be able to manage a google search, but of course it would be difficult to to open any page you foud unless it was text only, and what good is that. the only use for this product i can think of would be a paper weight, or maybe a frissbee, but a crappy one at that. sorry if i sound cynical, but you will understand my frustration if you waste your money on this essentialy really expensive piece of plastic. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
2,Not recommended,"My gf got one today, and i tried it to see if it's useful or not.Obviosuly, it's not as good as what i thought!1.can't load any flash/java...etc (means no youtube movies or myspace music)2.connecting speed is way too slow. It takes about 30 secs to load a page.3.screen is too small. It makes it really hard to use, for example. you would have to scroll down half of the page just to get to sign in boxes.or a paragraph would be seprated into tons of lines.basically, the only good things about it is that you can at least check e-mails or get news on DS. (spend 38$ just to read e-mails on DS?)"
1,Very Disappointed!,"The browser does not support the latest version of Adobe Flash. It only supports version 7.0 so many flash movies on the Internet (that use version 9) will not load! In other words, sites like www.youtube.com won't work!"
4,ds browser,when i first got i went on it a lot but it gos slow and but it was fun and i have i psp now internet's way better than ds browser.
3,Functional for occasional travel,It's good enough for occasional travel to read emails if you don't want to bring a laptop. It works as advertised. I was not expecting much so I was not disappointed.
3,"its slow, but it works","This browser works in a pinch. It's slow, and if you use windows live hotmail you will need to set it to the ""Classic"" setting or you will have a very long wait for your email. Clever use of the two screens to pan around the pages."
2,Sooo slooow,"I eagerly awaited the release of the Opera browser for the DS. My girlfriend tried to talk me out of buying it, but I had faith in Opera after using the top notch Wii browser. Now, I have buyer's remorse. Before I bought it, I had already come to terms with it's lack of Flash. After I started using it, though, I realized there were bigger problems. It takes minutes upon minutes to load anything. Loading a single Facebook page takes on average 2-3 minutes with images disabled. This application is basically useless to me. I could see it being of some use if you're stranded on a deserted island with only your DS, assuming the deserted island has wifi, and you have many hours of time to kill whilst awaiting your rescue.I'm already eager for the next gen of the DS so that Opera can put out a real browser. Only buy this as an emergency browser, since everyday usage is pointless."
3,WARNING,"Be sure to check the version of the browser you are getting! My boyfriend picked this up for me when it just came out, and unfortunately I discovered after opening it that it is for the DS Lite. I happen to have the old DS and the extra memory card that comes with the browser will not fit in the old style. (It is smaller, designed to fit flush in the Lite gameboy advance game slot.) You need the memory card to use the browser.The packaging states to visit the nintindo website to find the Original DS version, but I still have yet to locate a site that has two different browsers available."
4,Good for mobile browsing,"This browser will not replace your internet use on a normal PC. It does ok for regular internet browsing. I use it for browsing websites that are meant for mobile access (thus less multimedia content) and going to these websites is pretty quick and allows me to read stories, check sport scores, weather, etc without having to carry a laptop around the house. I believe most people already know this, but this requires a wireless access point (wireless router at home, an open wireless access point in a store or near a store)."
3,very handy,"it can be a bit slow, but what do you expect? it's certainly NOT a computer connection. It's very handy when you need something really quick and you don't feel like starting up your slow computer. if you disable images the website loads faster. there is no video, flash, or sounds, but it's meant to be a handy tool, not a computer replacer.websites like myspace are slow, where as things like email, google and other search engines are pretty quick.i definitely recommend this if you have a ds lite =)"
3,there are better things than this,a notebook that costs as much as a ds would be better and dsi dsxl and 3ds come with internet maybe crapier since it has less memery
2,Not worth the money.,"Yeah, it works... BUT no flash support, no audio, no video, and very slow, so what's the point? My son was very disappointed that he can't watch You Tube videos or listen to music. The DS does not have the hardware to support any USEFUL internet browsing."
3,Browser for emergencies,The DS Browser is a great tool for those times that you needto connect to the internet to quickly check something. It is of course not as fast as a regular computer but still very functional. I use it frequently to read books online.
3,For Basic Browsing and E-Mail,The DS Lite Browser is slow and does not render webpages well. It's ideal for a frequent traveler who needs a quick access to the web.
3,The extremes are a bit silly...,"...the moderate reviews are spot-on. The browser _is_ slow, sometimes frustratingly so. And it's a bit of a pain to use, as the display's smooshed and typing is a chore (though this may be common to other portable web devices). But if you already own a DS, this doodad gives you basic portable web access for thirty bucks, and that's a fair price in my book. This is a basic tool, not an entertainment device."
3,No Flash Player,I purchased this browser for my 9 year old who likes to play games on the internet. I did not realize that you could not download any of the flash players. It does work and you can look at web pages and do searches but I would not buy this for a young child. It is more for an older person who just wants to look at the news etc.
4,Works to browse the Internet.,I am using this on a DS Lite and it works well to surf the internet. The drawbacks are that there is no option to download/save anything and some of the websites will appear as RSS feeds rather than a normal elaborate website with all of the bell and whistles.One issue with the DS and not necessarily the browser is that it can only connect to password protected Wi-Fi networks that use a WEP key and not WPA or WPA2.
2,The browser that takes the fun out of browsing the Internet,"I expected too much from the Nintendo DS (Lite) Browser. When I heard the browser was from Opera, I jumped to make this purchase. Over the last few months I've used Opera Mobile on my Samsung A900 cell so I thought this would be as good (if not better).I was only in for a huge disappointment. Even with the memory card, this is not a fun browsing experience. You can browse WAP and simnple text sites with no problem -- but that's pretty much the world wide web circa 1997. I think I'm being too generous giving two stars as my rating.Save your $30 and buy another DS game (or save up for a real mobile Internet device like the iPhone).The Major Flaws:NO VideoNO SoundNO Flash plug-inNO Pdf viewerSlow, slow, and slower..."
1,BEWARE STORES SELLING DS LITE VERSION FOR DS,"There are web-based stores who advertise a DS Browser on their website, sell you a DS Lite version when what you ordered was a DS version, and then will not accept a return as you have opened the box to determine that the Lite version will not fit in the DS."
3,Browser,It does what it says it will. I you can check your email and stuff but for faster speed you can remove the images.
2,Meh...,"If you really need to have access to the internet and this is your only option, it's useful. If you're expecting a browsing experience that's any faster than a 28.8 modem, you will be greatly disappointed.The interface is great. I don't fault Opera at all on that. It's easy and fairly intuitive to use. That's why I gave the product two stars instead of one.The overall experience is so hampered by the slow speed and lack of features that you expect (in many cases need) that I gave up trying to use it. If I HAD to have access to something online right away, it wasn't Flash or Ajax based, it wasn't a PDF document, and I had the time to wait for it to load I'd use it....maybe."
1,DS Browser,This browser is not a built-in (have to purchase) and yet it does not work really well on most web sites. The speed is too slow compared to a wireless connection using B band (10 MB). It's not worth the money to buy and the effort to create this software.
1,Has very weak wireless security,"The Nintendo DS Browser uses WEP encryption which is an early encryption method that is very easy to crack. It is worthless for securing a home network. If you are using WPA or WPA2 encryption on your home wireless network, do not buy the DS Browser because you will not be able to use these higher levels of security."
4,The Tragic Genius,This book covers the life of Jack Cole. Famous for creating Plastic Man and latter his Playboy Magazine cartoons he killed himself just after realizing his life long dream of a syndicated comic strip.This book (though it really is more a square bound magazine) cover all aspects of his career with many illustrations in black and white. You see the man for the inventive genius he was.But what will really haunt you is why. Why did he kill himself? It haunts me all the time.
2,Inconsistent at best,I thought Hard Green was a good enviro contrarian take. This one is not nearly as good.
1,Raises the bar for fallacious logic,"Hmmm... If you wish it and you dream it, then it will come true. Well, that's a philosophy for some. Others prefer a well-reasoned argument - you won't find it here. It's out of print now - as it should be."
1,Some physics basics,"""The cost of energy as we use it has less and less to do with the cost of fuel. Increasingly it depends instead on the cost of the hardware we use to refine and process the fuel.""Answer to the authors: That hardware becomes more expensive over time can be due to increasing amounts of energy consumed in producing that hardware itself.If we look closer at what we are doing than man now is substituting fuels of low entropy for fuels of high entropy (and hence low quality). It is no wonder that we will need more sophisticated hardware for doing so.Humans never produce energy, they collect it. They collect those energies which are most concentrated and most easy to reach first and than focus on those of lower concentration and quality or on those at greater depths. Concentrating, refining and reaching this energy will take up evermore energy in itself. This goes on until the energy invested in such undertakings outstrips the energy gained by it."
1,Just do the math(s)!,"The fact that anyone could be taken in by the delirious pseudo-science presented in this book is a sad reflection on the level of mathematical innumeracy in our culture. For a free summary of much of the real arithmetic of energy: see http://dieoff.org/synopsis.htm. I can only imagine that the authors of this book have cynically concluded that telling people what they want to hear can be very profitable, even though all the actual evidence fails to support such false optimism. The authors' thesis is about as plausible as ""Intelligent Design"", and falls apart just as quickly when subjected to rational analysis. If you find yourself being lulled into a dangerous belief in this book's claims, then I've got an idea for a perpetual motion machine, to which I'd love to sell you the rights!Dave Hodgson [Graduate Electronic Engineer, US & Japan Patent Holder, for inventions that actually work!]"
1,Followed by Helen Caldicott,"Peter Huber was on C-Span 2 last Sunday. He lets us know that $50 oil will not last since oil can be produced from Canadian sands for $20. It should be amusing to follow this prediction. Is he unaware of net energy questions and EROEI? He was followed by three hours of Dr. Helen Caldicott which believe it or not, was easier to take."
1,Drier Then Burnt Toast With No Butter,"This book is Drier Then Burnt Toast With No Butter. I have honestly never read a book less interesting then this one. It seems as if the author is more interested in sounding intelligent then in conveying his message. I consider myself an intelligent person and read 2 or more books a month and at many points I had no idea what they were discussing. I only made it 3/4 of the way through this book and since I am not covered by a life insurance policy, decided to stop as I was so bored I thought I might keel over and die. Dont read this book unless it is a choice between reading it or 20 to life."
2,Bottomless well,"Great idea, poorly executed. Writer makes way too many wild jumps without telling a compelling story, mixing high-level pronouncements with in-depth and overly-complicated science/math explanations. Underperforms"
5,A sound response to the new religion of Environmentalism,"Environmentalism is one of our current society's new religions -- complete with extremist ideologues and evoking polarizing emotions similar to those arising from the abortion issue. This text is a wonderfully-sound, logical exploration of energy from scientific and economic perspectives. It reads like an engaging business text or extended magazine article, which is to say interesting, logical, and persuasive. The authors nicely puncture some of the Malthusian myths about energy which pass as current conventional wisdom. No doubt this book is unpopular with the mainstream press, academe or Sierra Club-types -- much of what it lays out is heresy to the ""big oil/industry/capitalism is bad"" orthodoxy, but convincing nevertheless. Facts are stubborn things! A good read with lots of food for thought."
1,Dumbass Philosophy,"This is a really stupid dumbass philosophy written by selfish Americans for selfish americans. The arguments it contains are ""highly polished and deeply scratched"". If you want to put your fingers in your ears and go ""La La La"" and pretend global warming isn't happening, then this book is for you. If you want to keep driving your SUV whilst pretending that you are not sending your grandchildrens future up in smoke, then this book is also for you. if however youc are about the human race, I suggest you don't buy this book unless you are looking for comedy,"
1,"All points of view are welcome, no matter how ignorant....","Yes, economics drive both effort and technical innovation it the petrochemical industries. However, world oil production is near the peak of a well established ""bell curve"" profile (a profile predicted AND experienced by the United States oil industry) Argue the decade of the world peak, or the slope of the bell curve decline, if you will, but the fundamental principals are understood, and most surely, finite.Lastly, to ignore issues such as CO2 induced climate change, harmful emissions such as coal fired - air borne mercury, oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, etc..... is both ignorant and irresponsible. Thousands of jobs will be created and new technologies will be discovered by the process of SOLVING our future energy dilemmas of security, pollution, and climate change, NOT by ignoring the real issues.So.... let's get on with it.Jim LeidelEnergy Manager& Mechanical Engineering PhD StudentOakland UniversityRochester, MI"
5,"great case, works well with Lowe Toploader Zoom cases","This case is well designed, durable, and can hold a wide variety of lenses, including substantial zooms if the lens hood is reversed for storage. The ability to attach it to a LowePro Toploader Zoom case is handy since it allows the body and two lenses to be held securely as part of the same bundle and allow access to BOTH lenses simultaneously, making smooth changes of lens and handling caps easier."
4,Works great,"This works great, fits a Canon EF 70 - 200 F4 IS with tripod mount attached and the lens hood reversed. The fit is snug with the tripod mount, but it fits fine. The protection only seems to be foam, so you still wouldnt want to drop the lens case with anything breakable inside."
4,Good Protection- Doesn't Fit Everything,"I found this while searching for a case for my Nikon 80-200mm F2.8 AF-S ED lens. While it does fit in here, the sun shade and tripod collar do not. Not a huge deal, but it was one of my first thoughts and it disappointed me.With that said, the fit for the lens is snug and it has lots of hoops and velcro for it to attach to other packs.I feel very secure having my expensive-for-me lens in and I would recommend to anyone. I would just let them know what won't fit in there."
3,Shannon Turlington,is a jerk for giving away the ending in his review. You may not have liked the book but to give away the ending can only be done by a jerk.
1,It stinks.,"For social commentary and suspense, try ""This Perfect Day"" instead. If you must read it for yourself, borrow it from the library. In my opinion, Rosemary's Son is a unforunate waste of paper, time and money from a normally quite gifted writer, Ira Levin. A real clunker."
1,"Oh, please...","I am horrified that such an excellent writer would stoop to such a trite and disappointing ending. The majority of the book was palatable, but the lousy ending left me with a foul taste in my mouth. Rosemary's Baby is indeed a classic, but this one is just a cop-out."
1,"Should've been names, ""Rosemary's Stillborn""","Although occasionally witty, most of the dialogue is cheesy, the plot paper thin and the pacing uninspired. I had to read the ending three times in shock, horror and disbelief at the sloppy, amateurish way a previously accomplished writer chose to end this yawner. Maybe I 'm in the minority but the book felt as if it were a first draft, a scattergun regurgitation of ideas, outlines, characters and witty snippets of conversation.Shame on the editor (if there was one)."
2,"Yes, it's a downer","A cautionary tale: I brashly ignored the other negative reviews and bought the book anyway. Imagine my shock when the reviews turned out to be correct. The ending IS indeed spectacularly silly (reminiscent of the movie DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, but worse).There are a few nice waspish observations in here (like ""Her mascara looked like it wouldn't make it through dinner"" to describe a distraught woman, and ""What's-his-nom"" to refer to a previously introduced Frenchman. But there's no real suspense or credibility in the whole enterprise.I've now read all seven of Levin's novels. This ranks the lowest. Read A KISS BEFORE DYING, THE STEPFORD WIVES and of course ROSEMARY'S BABY instead. Trust me on this one!"
2,a disappointing ending,"i thought this was a good book...but the ending was such a let down! i guess i really wanted more substance. it built up and up and up, then dropped you like a lead balloon. the characters were a bit on the sappy side. i liked the basic plot of the story, but i think it could've been written better."
1,Like ordering filet mignon & getting McDonald's!,"I loved reading Rosemary's Baby - it was a good suspenseful page-turner! Son of Rosemary, however, was a page-turner simply because I wanted to see if it would get any better. It didn't. Ira, Ira, Ira - whatever possessed you to dash off this piece of drivel?! It reads as a half-remembered delirium-induced dream that took about ten minutes to write down. Surprise, surprise. Did you borrow that ending from a ""Dallas"" plot from years ago? Or did you lift the whole story from ""Devil's Advocate"" - esp. Andy's icky incestuous inclinations? I found this book a total disappointment from a so-called master of suspense. And if this was supposed to be a commentary on society, evangelists, or whatever, it failed miserably, in my opinion."
1,Not worth your time -- it didn't seem to be worth Levin's.,"I cannot recommend _Son of Rosemary._The book is so shallow you can't even get your toes wet. The story is ridiculous, the dialog is inane, and I believe the twist at the end was written for the sole purpose of convincing the reader to look back on the book and think, ""Gee, I guess all that rubbish was possible after all."" Tragically, the conclusion robs readers of any suspension of disbelief they might have harbored after reading the wonderful _Rosemary's Baby._"
1,A big disappointment full of errors,This book is a complete waste of money and time! The only horrific thing about it is that it actually has been written (and that stupid people like me pay for it...). Don't read it. It will only make you feel disappointed and sad.
1,Not worth bothering,"I LOVED Rosemary's Baby and expected far more from the sequel, which I found boring and, frankly, difficult to finish. I did plow through, however, and agree with those who say the ending is a total cop out. Don't bother."
1,Son of Rosemary is literary garbage,"I'm tempted to review not just Ira Levin's book, but also the review from the New York reader who claimed that it should've been marketed to a literary avant garde audience: pretty funny since the book has absolutely no literary merit whatsoever.""Son of Rosemary"" is a cheap, slap-dash, totally uninvolving excuse for a novel which is - above all - pedestrian. It isn't funny, it isn't scary and its attempts at biting social commentary couldn't be more inept. In fact, the only worthy aspect of this terrible waste of paper and ink is that it left me with an anagram - ""ROAST MULES""- to ponder for awhile - an anagram that Levin admits was given to him by someone else.""Rosemary's Baby"" was a classic of the genre - and the movie is a classic of any genre. I picked up the sequel hoping it would be good enough to warrant a Polanski-directed sequel. Sadly, it isn't even worthy of Ed Wood.I could get more in depth - but why bother? ! Ira Levin certainly didn't."
1,Disappointed,"After Rosemary's Baby, This Perfect Day, The Stepford Wives - this was so disappointing. I used to say I had never found an Ira Levin book I did not love. This book has defiled this memory. But the other, earlier books are wonderful - buy them!"
1,Good Recycling Material!!,This would make a hilarious movie to watch on Mystery Science Theater 2000 (MST3K)!!! I am only sorry I have to rate this with one star! If you offered less I would have chosen it!
3,"Not great, but not that bad","Sure, this book could have been better, but it's not as bad as some of the reviews suggest. As for the ending, I wonder if it really is a ""Dallas"" situation? Maybe Rosemary isn't exactly where she seems to be. In any case, there is another nice surprise at the end. Has anyone figured out the anagram ""ROAST MULES?"""
1,"Oh, please!","Sorry, but all the subtle subtextual layering in the world can't make up for story problems of major proportions. And arguing that if I didn't like it, I must not have understood it is almost as big a copout as Levin's ending."
1,"Ira Levin, What were you thinking???????????????","yes, this one is a stinker. What can I say that has not already been articulated very well in the previous reviews. The reader who described this book as being only for the literary avante garde audience probably also considers Danielle Steele and Jackie Collins literary geniuses. An insult to the original book and to us readers who just didn't ""understand "" it. I'm astonished that this piece of trash made it to the publisher. Next time take up a collection, I would gladly send a check to Mr. Levin if it means I will never have to experience such a painful book."
1,Why Zero Stars Should Be an Option,"Place this one at the top of the list of sequels that never should have been written. The plot is ridiculous and the writing abysmal, coming nowhere near the brilliance of the original book, which Levin ultimately dismisses with an unexpected plot twist that leaves the reader dumbfounded and angry. Furthermore, his failure to reveal the anagram of ROAST MULES, which he continually touts as a key element of the story, is frustrating and inexcusable. What a tragic way to end what was an otherwise noteworthy writing career."
1,Dear God,"Well, it might be overkill, but I feel compelled to add criticism to the ocean that this book has already received. I feel almost bad for Levin and his complete breakdown of creativity, until I think that if this novel had been submitted by someone with little or no credentials it probably would be mounted on a wall in some editor's office as an example of the worst piece of writing ever submitted. Someone actually published this and I feel like they literally reached into my wallet and took out the money. I kept hoping while reading this novel that I was missing a joke, or that the whole thing would be revealed as a parody. No, I think Levin was serious the whole way through. I could recount at least ten solid examples of cliche, but to do so might send me into therapy. Don't even think about buying this book."
1,Ira Levin Sells Himself Out,"If you loved Rosemary's Baby, one of the seminal horror novels of the 60's, stay away from this book at all costs. The ending is one of the great let-downs in publishing history. What would cause Levin to savage his own work by cheaping the original with this pale sequel? The gods of publishing are the only ones who know. It is very rare when I finish a book and want to throw it across the room, but that's exactly what I did with this cheap-jack exploitation of a great horror novel. Do yourself a favor -- read the original again and let it go at that."
1,What a disappointment,"I began reading this novel with high hopes. I thoroughly enjoyed Rosemary's Baby, and could not wait to read the long-awaited sequel. I read the novel on and off for about a week. The book moved at a sluggish pace and I simply couldn't get into it. By the time I came to the ridiculous ending, I was disgusted. I will not give away the ending, but lets just say it's a major disappointment. Save your money and skip this novel..."
1,Aren't We Devils,"I just finished reading Rosemary's Son, the sequel to Rosemary's Baby. I've read thousands of novels, this is certianly in the bottom five. The terrible dialogue and tortured exposition serve only to irritate the reader and telegraph every ""surprise."" It is a piece of throw-away junk that deserves no respect at all. If you feel sorry for Levin, do your self a favor, send him a few bucks and take a pass on the book."
1,Quite possibly the worst book ever written.,I felt as if I were part of a bad dream...a very bad dream....only it wasn't a dream. I have often heard people say that the author wrote this one for the money. There is no doubt that Mr. Levin did exactly this. My only question is how can he stand the embarrassment of having his name on the cover. I am still getting over the ending. While Rosemary's Baby was in no way great literature...it was an amusing little read..this piece of rubbish cannot even consider itself a distant cousin.
1,"Very disappointed, the book was simplistic in style.",I was excited to read the sequel but was disappointed. The writing was jerky in style and disconnected making it hard to follow. The ending was a disappointment also. It strikes me as a book very quickly written and only for the money. It has no heart and I don't recommend it to my friends. It was a waste of a read.
1,"I threw this one in the trash, but not soon enough!","I was so happy when I accidentally came across this book. I LOVED both the original book and the movie with John Cassavetes and Mia Farrow, so I was thrilled to find out that a sequel had been written so many years later.I wish I had never seen this book. After I finished reading it, I felt so angry. How dare anyone -- let alone the original author -- totally tear down the ENTIRE plot of the original story, which was so perfectly written and filmed.I promptly threw this book in the trash, where it belongs. I couldn't even bring myself to sell it. I wouldn't want any fan to experience the extreme disappointment and anger that I did.Appalling!"
1,Simply terrible,"So many sequels disappoint fans of the original work - and this one is no exception. Although it begins well, it quickly disintegrates into implausability. Plot points are frustratingly simplistic or inadequately fleshed out, so that the reader is either guided insultingly through the book or left to fill in important sequences without enough information to do so. Somewhere toward the middle, I started turning pages to leapfrog to the end, never a good sign. And the ending is ambiguous - surely intended to leave the reader thinking about it, but a little too ambiguous for my taste. I spent an hour on the Internet afterward trying to have it explained for me.Take a pass on this one. Thank goodness I borrowed it from the library instead of spending good money on it."
2,Roast Mules,Can't figure out what Roast Mules is - any help?Found the ending very confusing - real/dream/fantasy?
1,The joke's on us/Roast Mules Solved,"Roast mules = somersaultI've adored most of Ira Levin's books. If you've never read This Perfect Day, it's worth the effort of unearthing a copy. That being said, if this ends up being Levin's last published work, he leaves a sad legacy. I bought the book at Goodwill for $1 and I still feel cheated. I would feel cheated if somebody had paid me to read it.This next paragraph could possibly spoil the ending, so read no further if I and the majority of the other reviewers haven't scared you away from the book.The winner among the utterly ridiculous sub-plots and literary devices in the book has to be how Levin so disasterously resolves his story. Let's just say that if you were disappointed by how they brought back Bobby Ewing on Dallas, you'll be prone to violence when you finish Son of Rosemary.Also, could somebody please explain why, oh, why Andy's sexual attraction to his mother was a plotline? Where did that come from?!"
4,Quick Read But Well Worth It,"I had one hell (no pun intended) of a time trying to track this book down in stores and finally I caved and bought it online (for a penny, might I add). I absolutely love this book. Alot of people thought it sucked because not much is going on in it until the last two chapters (What made me laugh is the fact that Levin chose to label Chapter 18 as 6+6+6). Yes, the ending DOES take a little thought process to understand, but when you figure it out, it's totally disturbing. I can remember first seeing Rosemary's Baby and thinking ""Wow..is this movie boring"". Then I got to the end and was creeped out. I thought the same to a lesser degree as I was reading this, but I would definitely recommend this as a must read, even if it is a little short."
1,This is one of the worst books I have ever read.,"Having read and loved the original Rosemary's Baby, I began the sequel with great trepidation (sequels rarely live up to the original). I finished Son of Rosemary, and, sadly, it was worse than even I could have anticipated. The plot is pradictable; the dialogue uninspired; the characters one-dimensional. To those who have read Rosemary's Baby and have anxiously awaited a sequel, I say use your imagination and compose one of your own. Levin has really let his readers down on this one."
2,The ending was an easy way out,"I found the original more believable. This was more social satire. Andy's following should have been smaller and Roesmary's suspicions greater. I kept putting the book down thinking to myself, ""It should be titled 'The Further Misadventures of the Village Idiot'."" The ending was an easy-way out that requires a minimal amount of imagination. There are times when one can get away with this kind of ending. I have seen it done very well on television several times, but I expect more from a book than I do from my television. It takes me a longer amount of time to read a boom than it does to watch a TV show or a movie. So I expect a little more substance. I did enjoy this book though. But it was NO classic wheras the original was."
1,Maybe expectations were too high.,"But nothing the other readers who panned this said is an exaggeration. As a writer, I know the temptation of a stiff advance, but I would at least try to do the sequel justice.For a really diabolical read, try Thomas Montleone's BLOOD THE THE LAMB. You won't feel like you wasted money and, worse, time on that one.If you must read SON OF ROSEMARY just to see if it's THAT bad, get it from the library. Better yet, don't read it. Think of Ira Levin fondly instead."
2,Rosemary lays an egg.,"I must admit, Son of Rosemary held my interest during the opening chapters. But, things slowed down fairly quickly. Then, finally a murder takes place (now we're getting somewhere). But, that ending! (GROAN!) Not only does Son of Rosemary end with a cop-out, but the wonderful Rosemary's Baby does, too! Don't bother."
1,A major disappointment,"It is a major disappointment to find this novel to be so total a failure. The author of the seminal horror novel 'Rosemary's Baby' and the wonderfully surprising ""A Kiss before Dying' seems to have given up caring about his characters or his readers. There is not a moment of suspense, mystery, or suprise in the book. The 'surprise' ending is a shopworn cliche, which betrays the original book and those of us who so admire it. I wish that the author hadn't bothered writing this terrible waste of his time and mine."
2,Reading this most anticipated book became a chore.,"I was really excited about reading the sequel to ""Rosemary's Baby"". I knew that the sequel wouldn't be as good but, I didn't really think it would be this bad. Character development was nonexistent. Every character seemed ""diluted"". The whole book seemed rushed, as if Mr. Levin wrote it under a weekly deadline. The ""incestuous"" feelings did not work. The book read like a Reader's Digest Condensed version of a really bad book. Now I know why it took Mr. Levin so long to write a sequel. He really didn't want to and his heart wasn't in it."
2,Horrible - Save your money and do not buy this book.,"This book was an absolute chore to read. I had very high expectations, and they simply did not come close to being satisfied. The ending [which I will not ruin] is, in my opinion, a cop out. This book does not have any of the magic or suspense of its predecessor. UGH! I wish I could get my money back from the bookstore"
1,Levin should be ashamed of himself!,Rosemary's Baby was and is a classic. How could its author spit on his own creation this way? The ending was outrageous. I bought this book and hardback and when I was finished I returned it to the bookstore and got my money back. I feel it would have been more honest had Levin reached into my pocket and grabbed for my wallet. People will buy this book because of the original and this novel is a massive cheat. He has forever tarnished the glory of the original with this piece of trash.
1,it could have been slightly worse.,"granted, i would not label this a ""good"" book; in fact, it is quite possibly the worst book i have ever read. the original novel worked because it takes a very ordinary premise (a woman having a baby) and frighteningly proposes the impossible (could the baby be the son of satan?). this one fails because it takes a ridiculous premise (the son of satan has gotten the whole world to worship him by simply saying ""love ya"" a couple of times) and then proposes the utterly obvious (could the antichrist be up to no good?). but let's face it, any sequel to rosemary's baby was bound to fail, because the twist has already been taken . . . and as bad as this sequel is, it is ten times better than the DREADFUL 1975 made-for-tv-movie sequel, Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby . . . at least in this version, the coven isn't referred to as ""the tribe"" . . ."
1,Ira Should've Quit While He Was Ahead...,"When Mr. Levin sold his soul, he should have made more than just one good book part of the bargain. Rosemary's Baby is brilliant. Son of Rosemary is garbage..."
1,What a disappointment,"I started this book with eager anticipation remembering the sleepless nights I experienced after reading ""Rosemary's Baby"". Well I slept like a baby after this one. The fact that it is not a horror book, though, is not the failing of this book. Ira Levin who so beautifully brought to life the characters of his first book, fails to make us care at all about any of these 2 dimentional characters, the worst of whom is Rosemary. I can only assume that Mr. Levin threw this together for the huge advance he undoubtedly received. I wonder if the money was worth the damage to his reputation as a writer."
1,"If anyone else had written it, Levin would sue...","Appalling sequel to his own mega-bestseller ""Rosemary's Baby"" has celebrated author and playwright Ira Levin plumbing new depths. He has the germ of an interesting idea here, but gets all fouled up on where to take his characters, and he doesn't seem to know his leading lady anymore. The climactic bouts of violence are heavy-handed, with an eye on the movie action-market(dream on), and the final chapter is sad, sad desperation. What went wrong? I think Levin is a writer of his time, and should continue writing as if it were 1965(there's nothing wrong with that). Being modern and up-to-date isn't in him, just as being kinky or salacious wouldn't suit any buttoned-down writer of his generation."
3,Good info,Good info but a bit out of date. Definitely geared towards VW fans but practical info for anyone tackling a wiring porject.
2,for eggheads only,"Unless you are willing to spend considerable time reading and absorbing the Theory of relitivity this book is NOT for you. The fact that the author chose to use the Pinto as his subject should be warning enough as it, like this book, leaves MUCH to be desired. Wiring diagrams are small, cluttered, and incomplete. Following (or trying to follow) these diagrams will assure you of one of two things; A Fire or a car that won't start. The novice who is trying to wire a car from scratch will find that this book was a waste of time. The more experienced car buff who has an electrical problem MIGHT find a solution."
1,Don't buy it.,Unless you already know how to wire a car and have a thorough knowledge of electricity and electrical fundamentals this book will be absolutely worthless. It will show you how to solder in case you don't already know how to. Don't waste the electricity necessary to order it.
4,Dont hurry,"I bought this book in 2004, I expected a quick fix for my electrical ignorance but I didnt get it. I reread the book a while later and actually paid attention then. I finally got it, if this book has a major flaw it is that it doesnt point out key things about electrical systems very well. Trust me when I say that this book delivers the goods. This is not a perfect book but it is the best diy electrical harness book out there. I have most if not all the books available here and this one is the most useful for diy wiring."
1,wheres the book,"how can i write a review if i can't see the book. you are telling me to review the book, but it is not available for review."
3,Can I put my arms down now?,"Although this is a low-impact video, it turns out to be one of Gilad's toughest (for me anyway) because for so long in the beginning of the video you're doing arm exercises, then doing leg exercises with your arms held out in front of you for what seems like forever. Tough! The rest of the video is easier--low impact aerobics then floor exercises. The abs section is kind of tough too, but not torture like that arm section in the beginning. Of course, I enjoy a challenge, so I try not to avoid this video too much, but it's not one of my favorites. As for the 30 minute low-impact section, it's just not advanced enough for me so I haven't tried it since the first time I did this video. It's more of a cool-down after the high impact 60 min. workout, if you have that much time."
4,Solid Case: unbalances small bags,"The Lowepro Case 4 is a great case for a long telephoto. It's well padded, well-built and protects the lens very well. However, I tried to use it with a small Lowepro Rezo 190 AW and found that (even using the SlipLock attachment) it completely unbalanced the bag. It was so uncomfortable and unpredictable, that I finally gave up and bought a Lowepro AW Magnum (where all the gear I use fits inside the bag) to replace both. I now just use the Case 4 for storage purposes or to bring the telephoto along in the car when I'm ""hand-carrying"". I believe it would work much better as an attachment on a medium size bag where another lens case could be hung on the other side of the bag to better balance the weight."
4,If Only,"This CD Includes BSB's Number 1 Single 4 The Year 2000, Is The Sign To The Begining Of The New BSB Era The One That Over Floated With The Released Of This Particular Single Cd."
4,"Sing, Song, Swing","Charlie Watts brought the elements of jazz drumming into the blues/r&b; English rock of the 1960s and his style has not been duplicated over the many years of his legendary work with the Rolling Stones.The CD, initially released in 1987, is the Watts' Orchestra - featuring some of the finest UK jazz musicians - in concert. Watts is what Buddy Rich was to his bands; the drummer leads by keeping the swing, but provides the soloists enough room to give their own ""autographs"" to the music.It is a solid CD from a musician who as early as 1964 publicly acknowledged his enthusiasm for the music of Charlie Parker - publishing a cartoon tribute of The Bird's work - and has never abandoned his love of jazz."

3,not a bad fountain,"it's always a little hard to know what you're getting when purchasing online. the instructions were scant, but after a few trials i got it right. it requires distilled water only - so be advised. overall, though it's a nice fountain. the water isn't tooloud or distracting. it's a nice addition to my office, & the kids i work with like it a lot."
1,This book is a lie and falsification,"It is a piece of propaganda from start to end. It is so bad that it could have been written by the propaganda section of the KGB. Whatever Patrick Tierney writes should be regarded as a complete lie. What's next, Patrick Tierney, ""The Protocols of Sion""?"
1,Ridiculous and outrageous,"This book should be titled 'lies and deception'. Even extreme anthropological Marxists like Ferguson and Harris - whose ideas Tierney uses - have distanced themselves from this work. The book contains consistent rewritings of other writers' work and deceptive misquotings (used in one situation by one author, and then trimmed and applied to another situation). The allegations that scientists and the anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon used a bad measles vaccine to experiment on the Yanomamo was dismissed by an expert on vaccines in minutes. The only interesting question concerning this book is why Norton published it, and why they continue to sell it. Astonishing!"
1,Trash and drivel,"When the controversy surrounding this book first hit the press, many newspapers who investigated Tierney's allogations found them to be untrue or exaggerated making them pointless. Also many people quoted in the book have said that they were misquoted. The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and others wouldn't go near this story. So what does that say about this book--don't waste your money. If you like fiction, you'll like this book."
4,Courageous Book,"I viewed the film ""Ax Fight"" in college. I was anxious to read the book Darkness in El Dorado when I heard it was to be published. I commend Mr. Tierney for his courageous profile of western-influence gone very wrong in the rainforest. The most facinating portion of the book was the telling investigation of how western anthropologists used the Yanomamo Indians to 'prove' their preconceived notions of human behavior.I have been amused by the vitriolic reviews from the outraged scientific community regarding this book. I do agree Tierney seems to have given a 'pass' to the equally destructive religious missionaries in the rainforest and that needed to be pointed out by the critics. But to say the book is way off the mark because he dares to criticize one of their own scientists seems self-serving to me. I believe this story needed to be told."
2,When Journalists Try their hand at Anthropology!,"I am currently an Anthropology Student at Wilfrid Laurier University, and for a Term Paper for a Classics in Ethnography course, I decided to look at this recent uproar over Chagnon and Tierney.I decided to buy Darkness In El Dorado so I could read it on my own pace, and not be rushed like many University Students are. When i finally completed it I was not sure what to make of this so called ""Non Fiction"" book.What I read was nothing more than an attack on Neel and Chagnon, with have truth evidence, and the twisting of quotes from experts. If one was to do the research I was intailed to do, then I beleive that you would all come to the conclusion that this book was nothing more than journalistic sensationalism, and not a true documentation of meticulous research as it is being praised to be. This book truly belongs on the FICTION shelves of any book store."
1,Accusations have not been substantiated at all after ten years...,"A long list of alleged crimes of researchers studying an indigenous tribe in the Amazonas is presented. It is rather riveting reading and you start to work up an indignation about evil researchers. The only problem is that there is no evidence. The author himself noted that he has no smoking gun evidence at all. Instead, after the publication, the accusations have all been scrutinised by several outsiders. Not a single accusation has withstood the external scrutiny. So the whole book is an extreme exercise in hypocrisy and cynicism (but I'm sure some asses would now argue that it all is a conspiracy against the author). Zero stars."
1,fiction should be called fiction,"There are numerous factual errors that have been refuted in numerous places and unfortunately the author takes potshots and makes false accusations and individuals who are dead and unable to refute his charges. If you want to read this fine, just remember that even though it's in print doesn't make it true or accurate."
1,The Shame of it all,"Through cleverly worded inuendo, this book pretends to expose serious ethical abuses of scientists, anthropologists and journalists in the Amazon. Yet a careful reading shows that none of the allegations are supported by data. While it is very important that all of us who work with people pay scrupulous attention to ethical issues - in this country and overseas - to create havoc with half truths and statements quoted out of context as Tierney has done is unconscionable. The reviewers who praised this book need to first investigate the allegations and not necessarily believe everything they read."
4,A page turning story of exploitation of the Yanomami Tribe,"I am not an anthropologist (I am not even sure if I spelled the word right). I recently purchased this book because I was doing some research for a junior high presentation on South America. I was fascinated at the implications of Tierney's book. While at times it seems like a bar room brawl between Tierney and Chagnon (Neel, Lizot etc)in the prose, Tierney states his points and backs them up with support that would appear legitimate. Power corrupts, and it is evident that researchers and writers should be wary of the power they can hold over their research.Great book Mr. Tierney! Thank you for opening our eyes wider to the issue."
5,to the light of day,"Darkness at El Dorado is a riveting and very well-documented examination. The cases Tierney has investigated are important enough in themselves. But beyond that, the overall treatment demonstrates how ""official science"" has been used to service pillaging the rainforest and the devastation of the indigenous inhabitants.The fact that right-wing intellectuals (not just Chagnon) are set to howling over this expose also indicates just how accurate it really is."
2,Whitman album is better,"The slides on this album is prone to scratches. And on mine, anyway, some of the slide pockets are too big, allowing the slide to become tilted and exposing the coin.Got a used Whitman and the slides cover the coins and seem to be more scratch-resistant.I don't know the archive quality between the two."
3,(Almost) Smog Heaven,"Rising from their ""supergroup"" origins, the members of Golden Smog have been able to cohere into a distinctive beast all their own. They certainly still wear their influences quite plainly, however. Their love of '60s and early '70s rock is evident throughout the new CD, leading to a fun ""spot that band"" listening game. I heard Stones, Beatles, Dead, Who, and Badfinger... a LOT of Badfinger. The problem is that these Fine Day songs sound good but are relatively non-memorable. The result of the weak songwriting for me was that instead of really enjoying these new tunes, I began to long for music by the original groups they sound like. In fact, I think I'll go listen to some Badfinger right now."
1,This one goes to the used CD store...,"I had such high hopes for this one! However, after about a dozen tries, I cannot stand this music. It is uninteresting and possibly contains the worst songwriting and lyrics I have heard in years. Or maybe it's the schmultzy music that is so unbelievably weak. Whatever it is, it has no magic, no risk, no intelligence."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Maybe a few more listens will help, but this album reminds me in a lot of ways of Bubble Gum music from the late 60's. Way too cute. After eight years I expected a lot more."
1,Not a good choice,"While admittedly a very pretty gown, there are very sharp, possibly plastic threads, or I'm not sure what in the seams of the shoulders that cut. I have done everything I can think of to find the sharp objects in the seams but cannot. I think it's in the actual construction. Wherever and whatever it is, it makes the gown unwearable. My shoulders were horribly scratched after a short wearing of it. Very disappointing."
3,edthird,"This is a good book and the only one of its kind of which I am aware. On that basis, I can recommend it heartily. However, there is plenty of room for improvement in future editions. Most obviously, the balance of coverage needs to be tipped in the direction of 4-strokes. At present there is a 4-stroke chapter, but it follows three longer chapters on 2-strokes engines and repairs. The other serious weakness, in my view, is the lack of a complete and detailed index. The publisher cut more than a few corners here. There are tons of missing entries: tire, tire pressure, tire selection, tire mounting ... just to give one example. And some entries are silly: ""two-stroke engine"" with two pages cited, despite the fact that there are three chapters relating to the subject. But all that said, there is plenty of really useful information in the book. The chapter on tuning tips, for instance, is wonderful, as is the extensive range of illustrations."
3,"Informative, but limited","The previous review is an accurate description.Gorr's Performance Handbook attempts to cover a huge amount of material -- essentially every aspect of motocross tuning. That's a lot for any single author, especially in a single book. The result is a lack of thoroughness and detail on certain topics. Four stroke motors, for example, are neglected in comparison to his sections on two stroke motors. The book is an updated version of Gorr's older book directed at two strokes.Still, I like the book because there is nothing else like it. I use at a starting point for tuning information, then follow up with more detailed sources. The chapter on chassis and suspension tuning is my favorite because there is so little information available on this topic.I can recommend it as an introduction to performance tuning. You will need more info down the road. It was fun to read despite its shortcomings."
2,"Man, Hank, the Trans-Siberian Express story is getting OLD!","Okay, you have a choice between recent Rollins DVDs. Either way, you're gonna lose.An unhealthy chunk of this, as well as the Live in NYC DVD, are taken up with Rollins' account of his time spent on the Trans-Siberian Express, a bit that's really not all that funny, and drags on more than his stories about his infected hand and almost stoning a fisherman to death Down Under (where this DVD finds him). At least here though, you don't have to deal with the labored discussion of de-scenting spray from the NYC disc.The earnest, intense rooftop commentaries seem kind of out of place as well.That's not to say there's not some great stuff here. Bush bashing is always a joy with Hank. His musings on getting older are also a laugh. I really loved his ""You really want my money son? MUG ME!"" story. It's just that this, like Live at Luna Park (but for different reasons), could have been so much better.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
3,OK..loud..,"Can't expect too much from this mini heater. I have high 10ft ceilings and this heater has trouble heating a 10x10 room. This little guy might be good if you need heat right away, but I don't see a big benefit in keeping it on for long periods of time if you have a more efficient source of heat.My DeLonghi oil filled radiator uses less power and puts out a lot more heat (albeit slow to start)."
4,Good little heater; energy efficient mode not that great.,"This is a decent little heater, although I used one from Holmes that was better. Bought this thing because of the 875w energy saving mode, which is not that warm, but that was expected. I usually end up turning it up to the 1500W mode (gets very hot) for noticeable warmth in a cold tile bathroom or under my desk. I also figured out that I like oscillating heaters better."
4,"so far, so good","We have only used it once so we don't know how durable it is but it is quiet and effective and is a nice, compact size."
3,good for its price,"it worked very well for the first month, but after that it makes noise while working which I guessed was because of its fan got dust, so I dust it off, but still makes noises."
3,Underwhealming,"This unit is pretty weak. It is okay for very small, enclosed spaces, but forget about larger rooms. I much prefer the Lasko 755320 heater I bought around the same time."
2,Too noisy and not very powerfull,"The product is too noisy! Also, it's unable to heat up a whole room with high ceiling. It's probably OK for a small room, let's say your kitchen."
3,It sounds loud...,"I am living Iowa city, and the weather is getting colder and colder. So, I bought this small heater to get extra heat for my bedroom. It actually runs very loud, which is quite annoying for me. Moreover, I don't believe the ""thermostat"" works at all. The manual delusively says that the ""thermostat"" can be used to maintain the temperature. It is not true. I have to turn it on and off manually... However, it is cheap. For that reason, we probably should not have high expectation."
4,little workhorse...,"Well, it's lightweight. I can carry it from room to room in a small 1 br apartment where I don't think the heat works. So this little workhorse has saved me. I have had to turn it on or off myself though, as I really doubt the ""thermostat"" really should be called that. It's not automatic. It does warm up the room fairly well, though. I tried to find something NOT made in China because DeLonghi is an Italian company, but no such luck - it's still made in China. Found it at Frye's for $20, worth it."
5,Happy with product; fits the bill.,This little heater is perfect for my bathroom and other small spaces. Saves raising the thermostat for several rooms when I only need a little heat. Very happy with the product.
4,Gets the job done,"I purchased this for my young son's room, on the tip that it was compact and somewhat loud. The white noise fits the bill for his room, which isn't heated as effectively as the rest of the house. This unit doesn't draw quite as much as some of the larger heaters, it's very small (a good bit smaller than expected) and gets warm but never so hot I'm worried about one of the boys touching it, even while it's running.The thermostat is a bit fussy, so it might take a couple nights to get it set where you want. The first two nights it was probably around 85 degrees in the morning, because I don't think the thermostat had ever shut it off. But really, if the only complaint about the heater is that it's occasionally overzealous, well, that's a good problem to have."
2,Thermostat Doesn't Work At All,"Aside from being noisy, the thermostat on this little heater is non-functional. Turn the knob until the heater just cuts off and it will never turn on again! Turn the knob until it turns on and it will run continuously, forever. There must be about a 20 degree F window on this thermostat which makes it nothing more than a redundant on/off switch. While the unit puts out a lot of heat, I would not recommend it."
5,A powerfull little guy :),"Bought for our bedroom on those cold early mornings before work. I should have purchased one of these years ago, a fantastic little unit. Emphasis on the little, its a tiny thing, but powerful. It has good fan speeds which fill the room well, and is my one saving grace to getting out of a cozy bed as the mornings become colder. For the money, its a fantastic item, it doesn't become overly hot on the front grill as earlier units were prone to, its quiet and solidly built, would defiantly buy another."
3,LOUD!,"This is my first Amazon review, but I wanted to write it to warn others of how LOUD this thing is. It does put out a good amount of heat, but you cannot use it in an area where you will be talking on the phone as it is distractedly loud. I regret my purchase cause I bought this for the office, but it is too loud there. Have to bring it home and buy another unit now."
4,Nice little heater,"I like this heater just fine so far. It seems well made and capable of heating a small area. I would recomend this product. If it holds up over time, I will love it."
3,It is annoyingly loud,"This heater is beyond annoyingly loud compared to others. I was a skeptic when I read this from others, but it's true. But it seems durable and gets the job done. It's nice to have white noise from it while going to sleep."
4,Small and Mighty,The DeLonghi DCH 1030 is an excellent space heater. It is small but packs a lot of heat. We purchased it for our audio room which is about 20x20 and it gets the room warm quickly. It is lightweight and easy to move from room to room. The controls are not well marked and it is nosier than I would have liked but is is a good value for the money.
4,Hot box! Woo!,"This heater is stylish & compact. It's not completely noiseless, however, I rather be warm than have silence!This sucker gets hot and is perfect to keep in the office. Love it love it."
3,Price was good,Pros: It does heatCons:Loudest small space heater I've ever heard. The office is clear full of heaters under desks and this one was so loud I had to take it home and get a different one. The volume/fan speed does not change with the high/low setting so it stays loud unfortunately.Otherwise it's a nice little heater.
2,Put out the heat,"Yes, it puts out the heat and it does shut off when it hits that the right temperature, but then when it cools down it out turn back on so, I have to get up and turn the it up."
4,Good for my office,"My workplace gets pretty cold, so I use this heater at my desk some days. It works amazingly well for being so small. The only thing I haven't really figured out is the setting where it's supposed to come back on after a while. I turn the dial back until I feel it click, but it never comes back on. It's not the end of the world. Perhaps I'm not understanding the instructions. It certainly gets the job done and for a great price!"
5,DeLonghi DCH1030 Ceramic Heater - the best!,This is an amazing little ceramic heater - impeccable quality and works like a champ.If you need a ceramic heater that is easy to use - dependable - functions without flaw - then buy this one.This little baby runs quietly and efficiently. It will heat up a small room (12' x 12') in 5 minutes and keep it toasty. I love DeLonghi products becasue they are made extremely well.If there is anything negative about this wonderful heater is that it is made in China.
3,A little bit of heat...,The lefthand knob on top soon became very difficult to turn from low to high heat to fan etc... So I leave it on low & just plug it in & then pull the plug when I'm heating the area close to my desk... For the LOW price I didn't bother to return it... It gives me the little bit of heat I occasionally require.
2,Lots of heat...and lots of noise,"This heater puts out lots of heat and warms up an area quickly. Unfortunately, it sounds like a jet engine. I mean it's so loud you have to shout over it. If I take a phone call when it's on, I have to turn it off to hear the phone. It's too bulky to ship back cheaply so I'll probably just donate it to charity and order something else."
3,It not what I expected,It not what I thought I was getting. I should have read more about the heater. I typed in battery operated heaters in the search and this is what it showed me so I assumed it was battery operated. It does get very hot thou so that is good I guess.
1,The termostat does not work,The termostat does not work properly. Not possible to set up temperature. Useless for useful heating. I would never buy again.
4,Lots of heating power,"I bought this for my upstairs office. Although I had my doubts of how well it would work due to the small size, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and well the little heater warmed up my 16x22 foot room! It's a little noisy, but I don't even notice anymore, and there is no tipover protection. Otherwise, for the price it's a good investment."
2,Greenhouse use issue.,I bought this for a greenhouse too. I doesn't work as well for me as it has apparently done for others. I have frost bitten plants and ice on the inside of the greenhouse. Last night when I turned the knob some and then back to the settings for frost prevention it came on. I just went outside where it's in the 30s and found the greenhouse temperature similar to the outside temperature with the heater not running.
2,Noisy heat,Although it is small but produces a good amount of heat also a lot of noise.I do not recommend it for your bedroom and if you want to use it on a quite place.I'm going to buy a radiator to get rid of this noisy.Actually it emits very good heat compared to its price and size
2,Does what it says and does it sort of,"I revised the rating to 2 stars due to the thermostat.The good:Fairly energy efficient.Relatively quiet.Pumps out a lot of heat.The bad:The thermostat started out functioning well but got flaky after about 60 days. Its now very fussy and hard to adjust so that it functions as needed. I substantially reduced my rating because of this Problem (5 stars to 2).Has problems with poorly wired GFI circuits.Some fan noise.Not as efficient or as quiet as the oil filled radiatorsDeLonghi EW7707CB Oil-Filled Portable Radiator with ComforTemp Technology, Black.The ugly:Some noisome smell on initial start, cleared quickly.Maybe the EPA should investigate the emissions from these heaters DeLonghi is bad but not the only offender.Overall a usable heater at a good price."
2,Little Loud -- Doesn't have feature I wanted,"I find this heater a little loud. I was also disappointed that it didn't have a feature that I love: You set the temp and turn on auto and then it stays on being either a fan or heater depending on the temp in the room. I have that on another heater and love it. It stays on -- you don't get that off and on clicking. It's a nice ""white noise"" for sleep. For some reason, while reading the reviews and description, I was lead to believe that this had that feature and that is why I bought it.If you want a little heater that heats fast and is nice looking, you'll be pleased. If it being slightly loud bothers you, you won't.If you want it to just be a fan, it will. Just be a heater, it will. But if you want a continual sound to sleep by, as a heater it won't make you happy as it will be clicking off and on. Not many heaters do what I was hoping this one would, so it's more MY fault for misreading than the company."
2,"Good heater, terrible thermostat","This product works fine as a space heater, but what I want you to be aware of is the thermostat. Its a simple dial, but if you want to keep the room at a normal temp (say, 65-75 degrees) you have about 5 degrees of the 360 degree dial to work with. With such a small amount of precision allowed, its literally impossible to get the heater to maintain a room temp around 70 degrees plus or minus 5 degrees."
3,"Works fine but thermostat does not work.,","Works fine to heat up a small room. The thermostat is useless. After adjusting as instructed to the point where the unit first turns off, it will never turn back on, no matter how cool the room gets. You either have to turn up the heater manually or just be cold. Unit appears well built for the price and it does spit out the heat which is it most important job but just do not expect for the thermostat to work."
4,"Great heater for single rooms, and more!","I love this heater and am thinking about getting another for another room. It heats my apartment bedroom well (though not TOO hot, which works for me), and even into the next room over. It's reasonably priced and very light weight. It also has a great 'white noise' sound that I love when sleeping. I would highly recommend this little heater to anyone."
2,Noisy and stopped working after a year,"It warms up the place, but very noisy. Also the cable got disconnected after a year of using, and the heater does not work anymore.Instead I bought : Sunpentown-SH-1507-Mini-Tower-Ceramic-Heater, and I am very happy."
3,Good for small size room Only,The product quality is good. the only problem is that it is pretty small. So it is good for only small size room only.
2,not enough heat,This machine didnt put out near enough heat & without a fan didnt satisfactorily move around what heat there was.
1,Broke after two months,I was very disappointed to find that our heater broke after two months of occasional use. The switch that controls the strength and power is stuck in the off position.
1,Yikes! - Trips GFI,"My unit arrived in good shape and in timely fashion, but, I will be returning it because it trips my GFI (causes my power to shut off). This happened both times I plugged it in and let it run for 10-15 minutes. My Lasko 754200 ceramic heater (got on Amazon for around $20)has never caused a GFI trip, and is comparable in size and ""sound"" (and I think puts out a little more heat). I suggest the Lasko!"
5,Winter Wonderland with warmth,"it doesn't get cold in Southern California, but don't ya know it, it does get chilly! Those mornings are perfect with this lil space heater.Pros:Two prong cordSmall sizeCeramic heatertip over - autoshut offCons:None noted.A real nice find; and a real nice buy. I also have used this to keep my feet warm and found that the heat is also good for warding off Zombies that are looking to invade. So far, Me 1, Zombies, 0."
2,Heats fine but thermostat does not work.,"Works fine to heat up a small enclosed room. However, the thermostat is useless. After adjusting as instructed to the point where the unit first turns off, it will never turn back on, no matter how cool the room gets. You either have to turn up the heater manually or just be cold. I have a Holmes model HCH4266 in another room that cycles on and off like it is supposed to but this model is either on or off, no cycling to maintain temperature.Unit appears well built for the price and it does spit out the heat which is it most important job but just do not expect for the thermostat to work."
3,Satisfactory heat,"This is a satisfactory and handy size heater. Although the instructions say it is not for use in the bathroom, that is exactly where I need a heater in this transition period after air conditioning but before furnace help is needed to heat the whole house. By plugging it in away from water sources in the bath room, it does a safe and satisfactory job in cutting the morning chill in the bathroom, making the start of the day much nicer. It is at a bargain price and the lowest priced small heater I could find, so I am doubly pleased with its performance. It is quick to start heating and makes a small bathroom comfortable in a few minutes."
1,Plug was melted and prongs were severely corroded.,"The plug was melted and the prongs had severe corrosion on them. Even so, the prongs had the little plastic cover on them that comes on new electrical items. It was very obvious this heater had shorted out and someone put the plastic cover back on the prongs, put it back in the box and it was sent to me. I will never buy from this seller again."
3,Decent heat,This little heater makes enough heat to warm up your bathroom if you are keeping your home on the cool side to save energy. It is pretty loud. I wouldn't want it in the living room while I was trying to watch TV but it's OK for the bathroom.
3,"Still working, but I wonder for how much longer","This heater was great to begin with. It heats a small room rather effectively and it looks reasonably nice. It's also safer than some other types of fan-based space heaters since it would be impossible to get to the moving parts without breaking it open, and of course no outside surfaces get too hot to touch (also nice, especially with a baby in the house).However, after only a couple of months (of daily use), it sounds like the bearings or something may be giving out. There's a louder-than-usual rattling noise when turning it on, and the overall sound volume (which was fairly significant to begin with) seems to have increased. Basically it sounds like it's gotten loose in the joints.We're still using it and it's still heating rooms fine, but my confidence is fairly low that it will last long."
2,"Strong Heater, Poor Temperature Regulation",This provides strong heat but be prepared to be constantly turning it on and off manually - the thermostat is worthless for maintaining less than about a 5 degree range. My last heater was able to keep the temperature within about a 2 degree range.
4,'Bose' for Heaters,"The box I got this in looked HUGE. When I opened it, there was a much smaller box enclosing this heater. As compared to my previous heater, this one looked a bit to small and underpowered. I have to admit now that I was wrong.Pros. 1. On max setting, It's pretty effective ( You HAVE to keep your feet at a distance )2. The noise is noticeable but bearable.3. Small and sleek4. Multiple settings availableCons 1. The grill in the front gets pretty hot. Might not be safe if you have baby @ home2. Does not oscillate3. The thermostat control didn't feel that responsive to me. It did make a difference..but not as much. What did make a difference were the 2 modes/settings"
4,Great little office heater,"I put this little heater under my desk at work since they keep it so cold in here. It works well and have been using it about 3-4x a week for the past 6 months. It does have a fan option but I never really use. Heats up fast and great price, I would purchase again if needed."
3,good heater if you angle it right,this heater is the cheapest i could get. it can ge really warm-hot if you angle it right but at other times its like not warm or hot at all.... so i would have to have it near me 1 ft near my bed and turn it on. the fan sound is kinda loud
4,"Small, but Powerful","PERFECT for using in my room, which gets very cold, but I don't want to turn the heat on in the rest of the house just to heat my room. The fan is louder than I expected, but not too loud as to be bothersome. The fan really make the difference, though, of helping the heat circulate throughout my room. Easy to operate."
1,I had to return it...,"It seemed to heat up the room quickly, but you're supposed to be able to turn the knob slowly and hear a click at the temp you want the room to stay at...and mine just never turned on again after that! I'm assuming that it was supposed to because how else would the room stay at a certain temperature...So maybe it would have been good if it worked properly...."
5,Very Good Heater,"This heater is really good.I am actually going to purchase two more and i would recommended to anyone. We currently use it to heat up the bathroom in the cold winter mornings or whenever we are going to bathe our newborn, This heater does not have that awful smell that some heaters generate. I have also used this heater in a 14X16 bedroom and I was surprised that it actually warmed up the room considering that the bedroom had 2 very large windows. the thermostat is pretty good. this heater has two settings to regulate the force that you would like the heater to operate in. the only hting that I wish this heater had would be a timer. :( you can buy a small timer from you local hardware and adapt it to this heater. very simple to do but youhave to spend a few $$$ otherwise this is an excllent heater."
4,Great little heater,"I picked up this heater because I have a cold front room, with people going in and out of the front door all the time. I keep it on the lowest setting and it keeps the temperature of the room around the thermostat at about 70 degrees, so the furnace doesn't have to keep coming on all the time. I've had this little guy for a couple of heating seasons (I live in Wisconsin) and it's a keeper. Also, it doesn't get so hot that it will start paper on fire, so it can sit up on a desk or table. Forget those fake ""Amish fireplaces""--get a couple of these instead."
4,Great Heat...slightly noisy,"Great little space heater for my desk at work, slightly noisy but after a while you get used to the humming."
3,It's okay,It works fine and keep my feet warm. But it is not strong enough to warm up entire bedroom. Also it creates quite loud noises when you operate.
4,love this space heater!,Needed something to warm the bathroom up in the morning since our bathroom is the furthest from the central heating unit and therefore the coldest room in the house! I love that this space heater has a high and low fan setting and a variable heat setting (although personally I always put it on high heat/max output!). Only complaint is the cord is SUPER short and I sure wish they would have made it longer because we don't have outlets everywhere and we have to be careful with a toddler around that she can't get to it either. But the product works just fine.
4,It's like having Randy come by and play for you (in 1970),"Randy Newman / Live (Recorded 1970 and released in `71): Just Randy at the piano singing his great early songs. Randy seems to have been born with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek, much to the delight of music lovers (or, at least, lyric lovers). This album is not exciting but is entertaining. A nice four-star album."
4,You will easily outgrow this,"I can't fault the instruction or the production quality. My grandmother will appreciate this and give it a 5 star ratingMy other ball work-outs:Natural Journeys On the Ball Pilates with Lizbeth GarciaAdam Ford's Stability Ball Upper Body Work outWork-out DVD collection:Trainer's Edge(Cardio Interval Training with Petra Kolber, Killer Abs and Back with Michael Olajide)Madonna Grimes Afro Latino MovesBodywisdom Perfect CoreBilly Blanks (Boot Camp Elite, Mission 2 Maximum Power, Get Ripped Series 1 and 2Kukuwa Dance Work OutStripilatesAfrican Healing Dance with WyomaJeff Costa's Cardio Strip Tease Workout Vol. 2The Firm - Jiggle Free Arms ~ Firm-Transfirmer SeriesDance with Lisa: Red Hot Salsa Made Simple ~ Lisa NunziellaSamba Party Workout 2 - Brazilian Carnival Grooves ~ Samba Dance WorkoutDance with Lisa: Red Hot Salsa Made Simple ~ Lisa Nunziella"
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"This DVD is not for beginners.1) There is an assumption that you already do yoga at an intermediate level and you are simply transferring it to a ball. The DVD should have been called Balance Ball Level 1 for Yoga Practitioners.2) There is a lack of simple slow progressions of the exerises. You are basicly thrown into a a full speed exercise with several movements and breathing points.If you are a practicing yoga this could be a very good video. For its stated purpose, I give it 2 stars."
1,Good for Grandma,"I was very disappointed with this video - it did absolutely nothing for me. When it says ""Beginners workout"" they're not kidding! I think this so called ""workout"" might be challenging for someone in their 60's who has basically never done very much of any kind of exercise their whole life. It was a waste of money if you ask me. I like the balance ball exercise idea, but I honestly got more of a workout from the 20 min. sample DVD that came with the ball than I did from this nearly 60 min. beginners workout dvd."
1,Should be called Balance Ball for Seniors,"There are a few good exercises on this tape, but overall it's just sitting on a ball for a half hour. Many of the exercises do not need the ball and in fact it just gets in the way. This makes me feel like they just tried to jump on the balance ball bandwagon by showing the same old moves on a ball instead of a chair. There was nothing here that made me feel like the balance ball was necessary or that this was a unique kind of workout. I felt downright silly during some of the moves, like one where you sit on the ball and bounce while swinging your arms at your side. When this tape is over, you will still be wondering when the workout is going to start."
2,Boring!!!,"This was a very disappointing purchase. I nearly fell asleep watching it. The host talks in monotone. There's relaxation music in the back ground. Overall, don't waste your money."
5,A complement to the other Suzanne Deason ball videos,"I was reluctant to buy this DVD because I already have the other balance ball videos of Suzanne Deason's. But I'm glad that I bought it. Balance Ball for Beginners has different movements in it and there were almost no repeat exercises from her previous videos. The DVD also has chapters which not all exercise DVD's have, so you can do one or two segments at a time. A practical purchase for a beginner as well."
5,Great taste!,"This is one of the best Irish Creme coffees I've tried. No artificial taste, no after-taste; just lots of satisfying flavor."
1,Do you like rust?,"Do you like rust? I don't. When I bought this ""stainless"" steel dish rack, I didn't expect it to rust away, but it did. I had to throw it away after only ~six months. It's not worth it at all."
2,Not well designed,"I found this product to be much cheaper in quality than I expected for the high price. It wasn't terrible, but I thought I was getting a 'high end' product, and it wasn't even as strong as a basic Rubbermaid dish drainer sold everywhere for MUCH less. And the more you ""expand"" it in a bigger sink, the weaker it gets.It was way too shallow - it would hold hardly any dishes at all, and full-size dinner plates would flop over in it! (I suppose it would be OK with Corelle or plastic plates.) Also, since it's not very deep, your kitchen faucet won't be able to clear it when there are any dishes in it. I returned it.My recommendation? Keep looking. :-)"
2,sink rack,"didn't really give compete dimensions, length by width, both open and closed. The dimensions showed gave differing values. Plus the reviews several times mentioned the item rusting."
1,stainless material,There are many types of stainless material. The one I got is made of the cheap stuff. Arms rusted and fell off.
5,My new dish rack,"Wonderful product, especially with the extensions on each side where bottles or large glasses can be place so that they don't take up space the plates need."
2,There are better,"My 6-year old didn't keep this action figure with his favs for very long. The figure is not a good likeness of Han Solo and is ""kind of boring"" according to the little man. The most disappointing thing was that while the price for the action figure wasn't too bad, the S&H was outrageous and made this toy ridiculously expensive. It doesn't list the S&H until after your order is totaled either, which is a rip off. I wouldn't purchase it again or recommend it to anyone for the total sales price."
3,36 Strategies of Ancient China,These are very definitely descriptions of old Chinese proverbs which are cut-throat ways to beat your enemy or competition. Interesting read.
4,"As advertised, a good book for the right autdience.",This is a good book for programmers just starting with C++ or people that have been programming C++ for only a few years. It would probably also be helpful for programmers moving to C++ from C. It is a nice refresher for seasoned C++ veterans.
4,Very good book to review some important topics in C++,"This book like effective C++ gives very important pointers.I found that some topics are worth reading like function objects because this kind of information is something you gain only with good experience.Lot of optics are covered. There are couple of design issues like factory method discussed.The topics are well explained but I felt some topics are too short like for example, the items on smart pointers and auto_ptr.More explanation could have been given for better conceptual understanding (I don't think he explained why auto_ptrs can't be used in containers properly).No item on reference counting unfortunately.But in general this is a very good book, good for interviews(should be complemented with other books like that of Meyers) and to improve one's understanding of certain topics like, funtion objects, function pointers, how to prevent heap allocation, how to make concrete classes act like ABCs etc."
5,Love it love it love it.... did I say I love this watch? :),"I used to think that it was very many to wear those big heavy flashy watches, but since I work in a field that requires me to use my hands, I needed something lightweight but still classy. I originally purchased this watch with a leather band... big mistake. The leather stunk very bad after six months from my sweat, pool, ocean, cleaning agents and other nasty stuff. I replaced the leather band with a new leather band on my old watch so that I can use it again when I go out to fancy dinners, but I really love this new watch with the metal band. It's very thin and doesn't look like I'm compensating or trying to make a statement."
5,Skagen Mens Watch,"Purchased as a present for my son. Very well presented,looks to be well made and stylish. My son is very pleased, it looks well on his wrist. Would definitely recommend."
4,Nice watch for a good price,"Nice watch for a nice price. I like because it's thin & light. The small dials for the date are a little hard to read, but other than that it's a great watch. The clasp is easy to get on & off."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"The description does not note that the 24 hour time dial is not separately adjustable to a different time zone than the main dial, it is therefore IMO a almost useless feature. The watch case is also thicker than described at closer to 9mm rather than 6mm though the tapered case design makes it appear thinner than it actually is when worn.I found the contrast level between the dial and hands less than expected from the photo, making it harder to read than expected."
3,Watch didn't work,"I purchased this watch for my husband for his birthday. Huge disappointment when I received the watch and it didn't work. The watch is beautiful, just wish it worked!"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING--BE WARNED!!!,"SEE ALL OTHER REVIEWS--DO NOT ORDER, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE LONG VERSION OF THIS CLASSIC SONG!! YOU AREN'T EVEN GETTING THE SINGLE IN A CASE. BIG RIP OFF AND FALSE ADVERTISING..THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!"
3,the real deal,"you fools. this is simply the reissue version sold in the stores for $5. it never came in a jew case or had any art work. if you want that, buy the more expensive import. this is also the radio edit for those who don't want to hear madonna drone on for 5 1/2 minutes."
1,Not worth one star,"In short - this movie is just painfully bad. A few pretty girls, a nonsensical poorly executed plot, and some of the worst acting on the planet! I would be suprised, but then again it is a Hong Kong movie. It seems that the only interesting ""Chinese"" movies being made these days are coming out of the Mainland and Taiwan. What is wrong with HK? They just don't have an excuse!"
3,Having problems...,I got this watch for my husband in 2008 and it is now in the shop for the second time. The first time they made so BS claim and charged us for the repair and it was less then 6 months old. Now it will not keep time and the second hand erratically and intermittently functions. We shall see what they say. I have had great success with Citizen in the past but not so much on this particular watch.
4,beautiful,"The watch is very beautiful, imposing.The only problem is that is too expensive comparing with these functions: cronograph and depth meter just.Even it is made by titanium, it could cost less.The best point is its power: eco-drive, that convert solar in eletric energy."
4,A must-read for every teenager and adult,"Even if one is not promiscuous, there are serious consequences to having sex with more than one life-partner. Since serial monogamy is so common, this book needs to be read by everyone. Your life truly is at stake if you ignore this doctor's evidence."
1,Not what you want,"This may carry the Schrade name but it isn't the one you want. It is a cheap version, the blade isn't as good and the scales (handle) is much softer than the original. It isn't bad, just not what I expected. The package says ""Made in China"""
1,Broke during Light use,"This was the fourth Schrade I've owned. So small and light I think the couch keeps eating them. The latest incarnation was nothing like the previous ones. I couldn't keep an edge on it for the life of me. Then the blade broke off the handle while trying to 1/4"" double braid. I've since switched to a Case brand that is the exact same size. The Case hold a fine edge and seems very durable so far. No more Schrades for me. When I pull out my knife I need it work."
4,Another decent Chinese model,"Simple knife, perfect size for my taste. Great for opening boxes and other general purpose tasks. It was not razor sharp out of the package, but it was sufficiently sharp for what I needed. Also, there is no fingernail groove for opening, but it opens just fine using your forefinger and thumb. Seems sturdy enough, though the body is constructed of plastic. Definitely MADE IN CHINA - as soon as I can afford a nice American-made Gerber, I'll likely have no use for this. However, it is comforting to know I have a fairly sturdy throw away knife for day-to-day applications in the meantime."
5,Very nice for the money.,"Its perfectly pocket sized, the blade is good quality for the money spent and it opens & closes easily. Arrived sharp and holds an edge."
2,"Cute beads, but difficult to use","My daughter received this bead set for her 3rd birthday. The hand painted beads are bright and attractive, and she was eager to start beading. However, the rough texture of the wood on the inside of the beads makes it a frustrating experience- she isn't able to bead without assistance. We ended up exchanging the beads for a set with a smoother interior surface. My sister also purchased these beads for her nearly three year old, and she had the same experience; her daughter was unable to string the beads- the laces snag on the rough interior surface, making it difficult to bead."
3,fine motor fun,"The quality of this bead set is great, but they're a bit difficult for an early bead stringer. Stringing beads is a skill to master between 18 and 24 months, but the channels through which you must thread the cord are a bit too long (accomodating the fun graphics) and hard to do for someone in that age range. They weren't the right toy for my 20 month old son to learn on. I recommend this toy for a child who can already string beads and complete other lacing toys. For them, this would be a great gift."
5,Common Sense,"I purchased this for my daughter. Her baby is one yr. old and already showing signs of temper tantrums. We watched it together and I was amazed that no one thought of this method before. It's just plain common sense. It's basically a baby version of the Faber/Mazlish ""Talk/Listen"" book that was our bible. Thanks for offering this."
5,The best gift...sleep,"A friend lent this DVD to us (thankfully since I didn't have enough sleep to read the book thoughtfully), and parenting became much easier. Our daughter had colic, I suppose. She cried a lot. This DVD easily taught us methods to sooth our baby. I then lent it to many friends who also found the methods invaluable. The DVD is essential as the practices suggested should really been seen, and not just read."
3,Worth reading but hard technique to apply,"Unlike Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block, I found that this DVD did not really equip me to do the technique. However, the book and DVD do have great suggestions regarding listening and helping your child to know that you understand him. He also has great suggestions for stopping the tantrum before they start. That's why I say that it is worth reading but a difficult technique to apply. We don't do the toddler-ese because we never seemed to do it right so it did not work but we have applied other techniques and found them to be very helpful."
3,The content is not as expected,I was recommended to have this from my daughter's pediatritian. I was kind of disappointed becasue there is not much more than what the pedicatrician told me.
3,Limited information,"I don't have much time to read books, so I thought getting this DVD would be better. It only covered how to deal with tantrums and talk to your toddler. I wish they would have touched on other parenting ideas to raise toddlers."
2,Not too realistic,We weren't blown away. I'm not going to start whining in public like my toddler does and I don't think he should be led to believe that it is ok to do. We do try to sympathise with him but not to that degree. The dr. seem a bit strange as well.
3,not for all toddlers,"The DVD is a great product, but the techniques illustrated therein aren't for all toddlers. My son reacted by screaming back at me--he didn't think my ""toddler-eze"" was empathetic--he thought I was making fun of him!"
5,Empathizes with child's emotions,Karp provides simple ideas that value the child's dignity and emotions while helping to stop tantrums. A lovely video for parents of toddlers.
5,Fabulous video!,I have not read the book but the video is excellent and perfect for expecting and current parents. I also watched Dr. Karp's other video and was also impressed.
3,Happiest Toddler on the Block,"I liked Happiest Baby because it made sense. Happiest Toddler did not give my child enough intellectual credit. Treating them like ""cavemen""? They are very smart by 2 years old. Except for a few good points, I did not find this video helpful."
4,good,"Not as good as the book b/c it doesn't explain the philosophy behind the method. But it is nice that they get right to the point. My husband who did not read the book, thought the tactic was silly and got angry that the dr. wants you to talk to your kids like cavemen. He understood after I explained that you don't talk to them like that all the time, just when they are upset. But at least he can get the information without picking up a book (that will be the day!)."
2,"It's an okay book, but...","...it's nothing what the editorial review would like you to think. I've read many of Frank's articles on Washington Post's Cameraworks and like many of his articles on there, this book is much ado about nothing. You're better off spending that money on a subscription to a photography magazine."
5,Go Governor Huck!!!,"Governor Huckabee is a fine Christian man, a natural-born leader, and an individual of great decisiveness and courage. He knows what to do and when to do it. This book is an excellent leadership book, and well worth the time."
1,DON'T BUY THIS! It is not the book!,"If you, like me, were looking for the Paperback version of ""The International Story"" by Ruth Spack, you will be disappointed. When you klick on the search result for this book and follow the link to something Amazon describes as a Paperback version of the hardcover, you will get instead an Instructor's Manual To Accompany - not the real book. I am really angry with Amazon for mislead its customers. Make sure you buy the hardcover if this is what you are looking for!!"
1,Total lack of quality in product or coffee it produces,I bought one of these and it worked one time then would not work after the first use. I returned it and received a replacement thanks to Amazon's great customer service. The second unit works but not very good at brewing a quality cup of coffee or a consistant quantity either. I usually have to restart the coffee maker two or three times to get the entire cup filled. I will definately not purchase another Toastess product! Disappointed in Deland!!!
1,bad choice,"All I can say is.. Do Not purchase this product! It does not work. I had to return this product twice. Two different coffee makers, two different times."
1,MORNING DISAPPOINTMENT,AFTER USING THE COFFEE MAKER SEVERAL TIMES IT QUIT MAKING COFFEE. I SENT IT BACK AND RECEIVED A REPLACEMENT WHICH DID THE SAME THING. ONCE AGAIN I RETURNED IT AND WON'T GET ANOTHER ONE NEEDLESS TO SAY. AMAZON WAS REALLY GOOD ABOUT REPLACING THE FIRST ONE AND I AM WAITING TO SEE IF THE CREDIT COMES THROUGH AS QUICKLY.
1,Right out of the box defective...not even one cup of coffee!,"I had read similar review at Amazon before and desmissed it thinking, well, if someone got a defected unit out of the box back in 2007, maybe by now they probably fixed any quality problems (come on, what can be that hard about getting a coffee maker to work?!). Well, not only did I have to wait all the extra time to get the item, but for $30 I should have known better and get something at a regular store. I had to return it and still don't have a replacement... If you want to have a decent cup of coffee w/o the pain, go out and get one at the store. Not this one."
1,Tastes like BLAH,"What a horrible cup of coffee! I tried everything:1) multiple brands/strengths of coffee2) multiple volumes of coffee ground in the filter3) different levels of wateretc... Hell, I finally even tried brewing it twice to see what would happen.No good. I've probably brewed 30 or 40 cups of coffee in this thing and they all suck!"
1,don't waste your money,"after less than 12 uses, it died. What else can I say? don't buy, don't buy, don't buy don't buy."
2,Personal sized coffee maker not what I expected,"The coffee maker directions were very misleading. Unless you physically unplug the appliance from an outlet, the coffeemaker will keep cycling. The auto shut off is not truly auto. Also, the plug is extremely short, making it very difficult to find a place for it on my very small counter."
1,just plain bad....,"I bought this coffee maker for my desk at work, i liked the compact size and mug size. I made ONE cup of coffee and the unit would not shut off rendering it useless ( as I could not start another brewing cycle. Second, you have to unplug the unit after every use, big pain in the rear... It went back. My advice would be to look at the Black & Decker models, never have a problem with them."
2,Not worth the Money,"I am a serious coffee drinker and when my last single serve coffee maker finally died, I ordered this one. After reading all the reviews I thought this sounds like a great coffee maker. My new coffee maker arrived and I made a cup of coffee for the next day to take on my comute to work only to discover that my coffee tasted blah - hot water (just like one of the reviews stated). When I did read that review I thought, well they didn't add enough coffee, so the next day I made another cup of coffee, I made sure to put more coffee grounds in the filter. Well, to my dismay, blah - hot water again, but with just a hint of flavor. For the amount of coffee you have to put in the filter to just get a good cup of coffee is not worth the cost of this coffee maker. I returned this and ordered my old brand the Black and Decker Brew-N-Go. Now this is a coffee maker, I should have just ordered it from the get go."
2,Looks lookingnice but works poorly.,"I have owned this coffee maker for almost a year now, and it is not working. The heating element seems to have burned out.I would not recommend this to anyone. Besides the fact that it did not last for one year, there are designs flaws about this maker.For one, it seemed like no matter how I had the mug placed in the designated area, there was almost always coffee on the counter after brewing a cup.Most flawed in the design is the fact that one has to unplug the device after each use, to reset it. The is a major PIA, and a feature not seen on any other device I know of or own.I would recommend anyone looking at this coffeemaker to keep shopping."
3,Makes watery coffee,"This product works okay if you are a relatively infrequent coffee drinker and just want something quick. The easy to wash filter is a nice feature. The accompany travel mug is pretty much junk. It doesn't insulate well and after one run through the dishwasher, it somehow got water trapped inside the insulating area.The coffee is sub-par however and tastes awful. It does not make a strong or even medium bodied brew. Even with adding more grounds, the coffee this product produces is watery. If you are a coffee aficionado this product will disappoint you."
3,design flaw,The on button does not work all the time. I believe it is a bad design as it does not click or trun. You just press down but it does not engage most of the time. Ha I known this I would not have bought it.
4,A good study,If you are looking for a book on the ancient Israelites origins you will not find a better book then this one.It discusses most of the current theories and discusses them in some detail. So you will get a fairly good background on current thinking on the subject as well. Unfortunately some of his comments do get a bit ugly but those of us who have read Dever have got used to this trait.
4,Who Were the Early Israelites?,Very interesting dicussion of the subject but neither maps nor diagrams were satisfactory to the lay reader who has only scanty biblical knowledge. I was disappointed that the era covered did not stretch back to the origins of the Semite peoples and/or evidence of the Abraham story.
5,Highly informative,A very scholarly review that both informs and raises interesting questions.A must read for people who want to get a grasp on the background to the Mid-East history.Larry Sazant
2,One Problem,"This is a very good summary of the current state of Biblical archeology, with nice diagrams and pictures. But I am a bit of a maverick and I kept asking myself as I read it: ""yes, but what if the chronology is wrong? What if the Exodus occurred in 1450 BC as the Old Testament states and what if that was at the end of the 13th Dynasty rather than the middle of the 18th?"" Then all of the problems in Dever's book would not exist. Do yourself a favor and check out ""New Chronology"" or ""Synchronized Chronology."" Dever acts like it doesn't exist."
1,extremely biased...,"Not one single author cited in the references is an Arab...Prof Kamal Salibi's challenging research and hypotheses are not touched...This is a very apologetic work of fiction (not based on archeology or scientific rational methodology), to justify a zionist status quo...Just for these reasons, from the comments, and taking a peek at what this writer has written, I will make it a point not to read, buy, or even refer to this book as a reference..."
2,Archeology?,"This book pretends that archeology can tell us what he Bible cannot and this is a wortwhile premise. However it faulters on the fact that it creates new myths after having discarded the Bible. Since the Bible is just 'story' it relies on archeology. But archeology only tells us that 'yes people did live here' it doesnt tell us how many there were or what they thought or how they worhsiped. For instance it cannot account for nomads or semi-nomads, an important part of the Middle East even today. Thus it cannot tell us much about the overalll picture, it can only tell us what it had found. What it has found is inconclusive and relies mostly on the theories of archeologists.So this book weaves together theories and then turns them into a new beleif system, one equally improbable as the source it seeks to debunk, the Bible.Less than credible. A fun theory.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,Nice looking unit,"with good heating capabilities and a smallish footprint, perfect for the bathroom. The only drawback is the annoying clicking sounds when the thermostat kicks in."
2,not what i expected,"when i got my box i was excited . i have now baught a few items on amazon but the heater does'nt keep a room warm enough for what the descripttion had said for the square footage, but i guess you don't always win online. the machine is maybe big enough to keep my bathroom warm but thats about it."
4,delonghi heater,"This heater has been great for our toddler's room. We wanted a heater that has a low profile (that was harder to tip over) that would give even heat. The timer is great to have, as the room can heat up right before bath time, and at 5 am in the morning without us having to get up. It gives very adequate heat for a northwest facing bedroom here in the Rockies that is about 120 sq ft. The only thing we noticed was that when we first fired it up, it did give off a strong oil smell, which has not recurred since the first 2 uses."
2,"Very loud cliicking, groaning noises","The heater works fine, but as other reviewers have noted, the heating process apparently creates expansion/shrinkage of the heating vanes, and the noise is VERY NOTICEABLE.This heater is so loud (ironic since it has no moving parts) that it's entirely unsuitable for use in sleeping areas.I wouldn't buy it again. There's plenty of other choices that do the same thing without waking me up at night."
2,Stopped working after under warranty repair,"I liked the product to heat up the bathroom in the morning. It also kept the bathroom dry and the towels warm. It stopped working at 11 months, was sent for repair under warranty and then worked again for 3 months. Not worth sending in for another repair even if covered. Will look for another heater."
3,Great when it's not leaking oil on your hardwood floors.,"So I ordered two of these items. Both worked as described right out of the box with little noise or drying effect of the air you get with other types of radiating floor heaters (the ones with fans built-in). I use one to keep my cat warm at night. He sleeps in the tub - out of reach of the central heat. I use the other unit in my office to save money by heating only the rooms in use at the time. The only problem is this second unit started dripping oil all over my hardwood floors and Persian rug. As you can imagine, I wasn't too thrilled, but Amazon is refunding my purchase price so I'm satisfied. I plan to keep the other unit until it breaks."
1,Bad idea!,"I bought this heater for my sister's dorm room. She complained of an oily smell that was so vicious she had to keep the window open. Despite leaving the heater on all day, her small dorm room did not warm up and it really only radiates heat if you stand right next to it. She is using it to warm up her clothes in the morning, but other than that - it has very little use. Bad deal - don't do it!"
5,VERY GOOD HEATER!,"I've got so many good things to say about this heater. First of all, we have 2 Delonghi heaters. The first one we've had for 8 years now and is still in good working condition,and we just bought the second recently and they both work great! It heats up in as little as 1/2 hour to 1 hour on medium-high setting and dosen't run up my electric bill.Then I turn it down to low for the rest of the day and night. It heats up a medium room of 12X14 nicely. My family loves it alot. It takes the chill off the air and it's not too warm either."
2,Stopped Functioning After one Season,I used this product in my bedroom for one season with great success. It kept my room toasty warm. However after a few days into my second winter it stopped working completely. I checked other reviews on Amazon and this does seem to be a common issue. Now that the warrenty is up I don't know what to do. I am disappointed with this purchase!
3,"For the price, get a bigger heater","This small radiator heats as well as the honeywell's bigger radiator. Howeer, for the price, you're better off getting a bionare. Heats faster than oil filled. Anyway, this radiator died on me about a month ago(bought it in january) and had to send it to a hard-to-find representative."
2,De Longhi Radiator,"First product seemed to leak, and soon stopped working.Replacement (thank you) seems ok, but (plastic) cover[ends] seems not to fit well.General comment: heat - ok, cosmetics - less than expected."
3,Works well for its size,"I got this because it has the timer feature, which means it warms up the bedroom while I'm downstairs and goes off in the morning. However, I wish it had an overide switch on the timer because if you want it on at a different time you have to resent all these tiny pins that look like they might break. Better bet is to find a non-digital heater with no timer and get a separate appliance-grade timer ($10 or so) which has a switch you can move independent of the time. However, this puts out a lot of heat for its tiny size and unlike some heaters has three settings - I use just 500 wats most night snad it works great."
3,Nice even heat and compact ; Odor and control issues.,"We have 2 other DeLonghi oil filled radiators and this works as expected . I have two complaints, however. After a few hours of use the heater still gives off an unpleasant odor when turned on. This will probably go away, but I wish DeLongi could use an odor free paint or do the break-in at the factory. One should not have to break-in an appliance in one's garage.Also, the timer-the reason I bought this particular model- is poorly designed. The only way to turn on the heater is to flip the timer pins to on. There should be a separate switch enabling one to choose between always on and timercontrol. This would avoid the necessity of fiddling with the timer when one just wants a little heat."
4,DeLonghi TRN0812T,"Overall i like the heater. I was disappointed with the height of the aparatus. Also the timer system, didnt like (it's manual) Really have to read instruction on how to set the timer."
4,So Far So Good!,"I've been using this radiating heater for a few days now, and it's working well. I'm heating a bedroom-sized office which would normally be around 50-60 degrees. When I leave the room and come back in, I easily notice that the office is much warmer. This takes about 10 minutes to make a noticeable temperature change and ~15-20 minutes to reach final desired temp, which is pretty good if you're familiar with radiators. It doesn't make any strange noises or smell bad, so I'm very glad I purchased this instead of a noisy fan-heater.On the negative, the knob controls are a little antiquated though (eg. the programmable timer still has those little flip-switches for each 15-min integral which you want the unit to stay on/off, and the thermostat knob is a little odd), but those are not a significant problem as they do still work as expected. Considering this one is in the low price range for radiators ($49 from Amazon), the unit is great."
1,Buyer Beware! Product worked for only 1 year,"This is a nice small little heater we used to heat our bedroom and later our living room. We had no problems whatsoever for an entire year, until today - it broke! We checked the outlet, the GFCI plug, etc. My only consolation is that I am not the only one, so buyer beware. Seems for a good number of reviewers that this heater only has a year's lifespan."
1,3 different units stopped working within a year.,"Since I live in a temperate climate (rarely drops below 35 degrees F), I pretty much never run my furnace and only use space heaters to heat my house. I bought three of these units last year, and was just thrilled with them- they did what they needed to do heating-wise, the programmable timer was super convenient for areas like my bedroom that I don't need heated when I'm not home, and the GFCI plugs made me feel better about running them in rooms with older wiring.Well, the first one quit working within 8 months. I had a spare that didn't have a GFCI plug and used that instead, since that one was in a room with brand new wiring. The second one quit a couple months later. I ordered a new one, same model, to replace it. The third one just quit this week, and now that I am seeing the number of reviews that say these guys quit working within a year, I won't be ordering the same model to replace it."
1,Constantly shuts off and don't put out much heat,"This heater sucks up power and don't put out much heat. I have a small bathroom and it will not even keep that warm. The GFCI plug keeps tripping and turning the heater off. Its plugged into a GFCI outlet which does not trip so the fault is within the heater. This thing is a total piece of crap and a waste of almost $70. I feel like I've been robbed. Buyer beware, this thing is a RIP OFF."
4,"Timer Works Well, Heat is good",Got this to heat my master bath in the morning. I can set the timer and the heater comes on before I get up. Only problem is that it does not heat the bathroom quickly.
1,Returned!,Out of the box the heater did not work. I own two other DeLonghi heaters for over five years and they are great and still working. I like the programmable feature that you set once and it comes on without you thinking about it. I bought this one as a Christmas present for a relative. How embarrassing to have to substitute another gift at the last moment. Very disappointed and will not order another one. Someone at the Quality testing desk fell asleep on the job!Stan
1,Had to change this review,"This little radiator is perfect for the bathroom, on those cold mornings/nights when taking a shower is an experience you're not looking forward to. It fits nicely in a corner when not in use, and takes the chill off the average bathroom in about 15 minutes. I haven't used the timer yet, but just from looking at it and reading the instructions, I can definitely see how some other reviewers have found it a bit difficult to navigate. But all in all, this heater does exactly what I need it to do... warms up my bathroom.UPDATE: This heater broke down shortly after my initial review, after relatively few uses. It took months of arguing, but the company finally did replace it. The replacement stopped working after about a month, having been used for about 4 hours a week. RUN, DON'T WALK, away from this thing."
3,tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick - noisy timer,"the heater works fine, 2 levels of power helps so that you don't trip the circuit breaker if you are running lots of other things on the same circuit. The timer is a nice feature...but...it makes tick tick tick sound all of the time, which may or may not matter to you. If you are in a quiet office, you will probably hear it always."
4,good deal,This heater is small and compact. It seems well built with nice easy to use features. It delivers a fair amount of heat for it's size. For the price it was a good deal. I am using it in my cellar in small room where when I need to warm up the area to ferment beer and wine.
2,"Loved it, but it broke after a year - two of them, in fact","We needed a small, safe heater for our bathroom and got this one. It's small but powerful, and did a great job of heating - so good, in fact, that the next year we bought another one for one of our bedrooms.That's the good news. The bad news is that the first one died shortly after we bought the second one, and the second one died just over a year after we bought it, as well. Note that the second one was never used in the bathroom or moist area, so that wasn't the cause.It's a shame, because up until the point that they died we loved these heaters."
2,has strong smell when I turn it to max heat,"On the second day we used it, we turned it on to max heat since that day was cold. It was put in my baby's bedroom. Then after half an hour we heard that he cries. When we got in, there was very strong smell coming from the heater, the smell is like that some plastic material is burned. Horrible! Don't know whether it's toxic or not."
1,Disappointing,"This product was generally very disappointing, for three reasons:- For about 3 months after purchase, it is emitted a putrid smell of oil.- The thermostat leaves much to be desired - the room is either boiling hot or freezing cold.- 5 months after buying it, it just stopped working - $75 down the drain.Not recommended in the least."
1,Leaked on 2nd use,"On the 1st run, this heater performed well. I like the idea of a slow steady heat source that lasts after you turn it off. Heated my 12 x 17 room with no problems.On the 2nd run, it leaked oil all over my carpet 10 minutes into heating. Dripping right from the bottom on the end opposite the controls. I unplugged it and moved it onto the linoleum and is currently still leaking as I type this.I like the idea of this heater but I didn't pay $69.99 at BB&B; for a !@*$@!!! idea.Will I try it again? Depends on the defect rate. Maybe there's another radiator brand out there."
3,Only a good choice if you have an enclosed space,"I bought the DeLonghi radiator heater because I was looking for something that provided good heat but didn't have the noise associated with fan driven units. This unit certainly heats up with settings for 500, 700 and 1200 watts but the heat mostly radiates up, not out. This means that in order to feel the heat, it must gradually heat up the room and if your room isn't enclosed, you don't really feel the heater working. Since my home is more open, the heater had very little effect. In fact, I put a thermometer about 4 feet from the unit and after running it all afternoon, the temperature only went up 1 degree. I couldn't test it in a more enclosed space but I'm guessing it would work better there. For my needs, I'll go back to a fan driven unit that puts more heat directly into the needed area."
4,"works, just a tad bit noisy","works well, puts out good heat and doesnt get too hot for kids touching it with the larger surface area of the fins. only problem is on med or high, the heating element creaks as the metal in the unit expands and contracts while the element turns on and then turns off. whatever metal they used in there, it changes size to easily with temperature so in themiddle of the night, click... tick tick tick tick tick as the element heats up, then click, element goes off and tick tick tick... as the element cools down. the larger version of this didnt have the problem, you cant tell, hardly, when the heater is switching on and off, you just get nice heat coming off it."
3,Good heater but noisy,"I bought it, used it for a week and then returned it. The Delonghi TRN0812T heater did a good job heating up my bedroom on days that the outside temperature was about 40-50s. I liked the fact that the temperature fluctuations were mild, which is certainly an advantage oil-filled heaters have over other systems such as coil heaters. The show stopper however, was the noise it made when the thermostat triggered the heating element. It was as if someone was knocking hard on your window: tik, tik, tik ...It woke me up everytime several times per night. This was probably caused by the expansion of the metal sliding over another hard surface, and it is a serious defect in design. I ordered another oil-filled model hoping that it doesn't have this problem...but, that's going to be another review."
3,Good But No Manual Over Ride,This did put out a good amount of heat. Only problem is there is no manual over ride and the 24hr programmable timer is difficult to program.
2,Would be great if it lasted,"Met all my needs, works well, and for a great price, but died before hitting the two year mark (so basically two winters). Conveniently, the warranty is only for one year. If you do buy this heater, take care only to turn it up as high as you need it. If you leave it on MAX all day it'll wear itself out."
3,Click Click,"Heater worked fine for 3 days. Then, every time it heated up and cooled down it made a very irritating clicking noise. Can not use it in the bedroom.....It is noisy. I will return it and try another one time. I like the design and safety of the product."
5,Excellent product/worth the price,"I purchased this heater through a recommendation of a friend. The product is excellent, looks good and most of all is very, very quiet. Heats up a pretty large room with high ceilings. I recommend this product without reservation."
4,Delonghi portables x2,I purchased my first DeLonghi Oil-Filled Radiator in about October '09. I bought it for my son's upstairs bedroom (it's the attic area of an older home so chilly in winter). It worked great. Heated an area about 300 SQ FT nicely. He liked it so I decided to by a second for his rumpus room in the basement where there is no heat but he and his friends spend a lot of time playing video games etc. I bought #2 in December '09. It also heated a room of about 100 sq ft. very nicely. But within the month it ceased to function. No explanation. Just stopped working one day. Very disappointing. I did return to Amazon for replacement. The replacement unit arrived/an exchanged was made in mid January '10. So far so good. Amazon was great about the exchange. But it was a little disappointing that unit #2 only lasted a month. Overall I would recommend this unit for small to medium sized rooms.
5,DeLonghi,"This is an awesome little heater. I bought it for my wife who pooh poohed it as being too small and since she rules the domain I figured it would be a quick exit... nope.. she loves it. Works reat... I have owned the larger oil filled ones when we had little kids in the past. Since the quality was a known factor it was a simple decision to stay with the brand. Excellant... no hot spots.. does what we wanted and for the price on Amazon... what can you say? Look at the Mfg website and compare.... Thanks Amazon and Delonghi. I am not a troll or being paid to write this... I live in YL, it is very moderate... mornings can be a bit cold in a back master bath where it resides in winter now...."
2,Defective and no help from Delonghi,"It's a great looking heater. The size is right too. And, it gets good and hot fairly rapidly. However, within one week of opening the box the thermostat stopped working. I had the heater in my kids' room set to warm to about 66 degrees. When I came into the room the next morning it was in the 80s and the heater was hot as a pistol. I soon figured out the thermostat was not working. I tried numerous times to get Delonghi to at least talk to me about the problem without success. So now I have a heater I have to watch very carefully and rarely use. I would have returned but by the time I opened the box I was well out of the return period."
2,Too noisy for baby's room,"This heater makes rather loud clicks at seemingly random times. Not sure if it has or will wake up baby, but I'm not about to take any chances, he is not a good sleeper as it is. Plus, the clicks get amplified over our monitor and wake us up. I think I will try the ""eco-heater"" next.Addendum: Well, we kept this heater for the baby's room. The loud clicking has subsided for the most part, and it does work well, and is compact. When it does click or creak, it does not seem to wake him up. Also, it seems to be more stable than the taller versions."
2,Not so hot llike other space heater,"I have multiple space heaters, this one i bought for tunr on at a specific timing and the configurations are complicated and then there is no overiding remote that i was thinking would be available."
5,wonderful,"I bought this space heater a month ago. It has been working very well. The thermostat and timer are both easy to use. I have a (very) small one bedroom apartment, and it heats the whole thing quite well. My apartment is only outfitted with electric heating boards and that was much less efficient and more expensive than this."
4,works great,"i really like this product. this is my second one in 4 years, i think the last one died when our power went out. 24 hr timer & thermostat. not sure the cost of electricity usage. my only per peeve is the smell, takes a long time to burn off, have used it every day for over 3 weeks and it still smells. it's small but sturdy."
2,Heat output just isn't that much,"This heater works fine and is compact, but it just doesn't do the job heating. I have it in a small room (10 X 12), and if I close it off and leave it on high for several hours, it will warm the room up some, but maybe only to about 67-68F according to the indoor thermometer I have on the wall. It is warm right over it, but how much time do you spend over a heater in your home like you would over a campfire in the woods? I will say it is quiet compared to a heater fan of course, so if you want to be cold and in peace and quiet, it will work. I would say this is product is only for a small, enclosed space such as a bathroom or small bedroom that is closed off, well insulated and has no windows."
1,So Disappointed!!,"This product worked well for the first few days and then would not turn on at all. Tried the reset buttons, checked the outlets - nothing! It has been returned to Amazon and am awaiting my refund. I will not be purchasing this product again."
5,"Safe, efficient and easy",this is my second DeLonghi heater. Now I have one in each bedroom. They don't blow so its not instant heat. It is consistent warmth. It is quiet heat. It is safe so I leave it on during the night. Great product. (I just turn it on and off - I haven't set the timer to go on before I get home)
1,DON'T BUY DELONGHI!! THEY ARE JUNK!!!!!,"I bought this exact same DeLonghi heater three years ago, only used it a few months out of the year, and it just died. Cheap junk made in China. Delonghi is CRAP!"
1,dissatified!,"Worked splendidly for 2 weeks then completely stopped. ""Someone"" in this family had thrown out all paperwork, instructions, receipts, warranty info- everything. Now what!2 months later tried again and bought this identical item at Bed,Bath&Beyond; and from the beginning there was an oil leak that required plastic padding for the week we used it. BB&B; gave us a full refund which was much easier than Amazon's return procedure."
2,Not simple to operate,"Although Delonghi is a reputable name, I cannot figure out how to properly operate this heater. There is limited information and I even brought it to a repair shop recommende by Delonghito see if there any problems. Needless to say, the repair shop did not find any problems with it. Lo and behold, I brought home and still cannot operate it!!! I would like to returned it, please advise!! Thank You"
1,not recommended,"Mine stopped working without notice after two weeks of purchase. When I called customer service, they asked me to ship it to service center on my own cost. Anyway, DON'T BUY IT!!!"
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!,"I have been using great working larger size DeLongi radiator for 3 years. And I wanted buy another DeLongi radiator in smaller size. However I had to return 2, T W O radiators!!! First one stopped working within one month and second one stopped working in second day. I only used them at night too.They should recall this model!!!!!"
1,Less than 30 days quit working,"Sold as new. Seller offered to refund or replace, but requested the item be returned in the original box, which I don't have anymore. Also, seller charges a 15% restocking fee...on a non-functional return they will likely refurbish and re-sell! After time and money spent shipping and the restocking fee, not worth the bother. A great policy for the SELLER."
1,Disappointing for a DeLonghi product,"I had an older DeLonghi heater, and gave it to my brother. I wanted to get one of the sleek, newer looking models, like the DeLonghi Solaris. But this thing doesn't give off half the heat that my old heater did. Seriously, this isn't what I expected. If I turn it on maximum settings, and place it close to where I'm going to be sitting, or near the bed, it's almost okay. But the other, taller model I had before was light years better. Bummer. I'd return it, but no longer have the box, etc. But I wish I hadn't got it."
2,Worked Well While it Lasted,"This was my fourth Delonghi oil-filled radiator. I buy them instead of higher rated, ceramic space heaters because I prefer the slow, steady heat and they are safer around children and in the bathroom.This one worked great for almost two years and then just stopped. The previous three lasted between three and seven years so this one underperformed.I'm in the market for my fifth and it will be a Delonghi, just not this one."
1,Didn't last 5 months.,"I bought this in December and it worked great for 4 months. Good controls and timer, small footprint, and easy to use. If only it lasted maybe, FIVE YEARS LONGER!"
2,has potential,"Great design, had hoped it would work better than it does. Gives off noxious odor even after putting in garage for 2 weeks. Electric bill jumped up $50 during those two weeks. The one I bought could be a defective fluke but Amazon won't refund because it contains a flammable liquid(oil).Have to go through manufacturer which has been a pain also. Please keep this in mind when buying something like this. I have other DeLonghi heaters bought elsewhere and they work great."
1,Timer Broke within 3 days,"Purchased to help me get through a cold bedroom through the winter, the timer on this broke within 3 days, turning it into just another oil heater. Where to return it, once bought through Amazon? And why pay the shipping to return? The experience has reminded me that Buying Local is ALWAYS a better deal. Dang it ! I was really looking forward to this one."
2,not really what I was expecting,"firs of all this was intended for my bathroom which is quite small and wt eaven after having it turn on one hour and a half befor shower time the room is still quite cold, maybe not as much as before but deffenetly not worm.the other issue is that either you use the timer or you turn it on and of, so if I want to use it at another time diffrent as the progrram I'm forced to turn the timer dial and therefore loose the actual time."
1,Waste of money!!,"We have two different delonghi heater and one works so perfectly and this one so horribly! It worked great for few months and then got too hot, does not turn off properly. The on/off dial settings stopped working"
3,Great when it works,"Of the three that we have purchased, only one of them works perfectly. One of them started ticking obnoxiously after less than a year. We had to throw that one away. The replacement that we ordered started clicking loudly with a couple of weeks. It sounds like two pieces of metal banging loudly against each other. After another week or two, it started buzzing.It's clear that the timer mechanism in these are unreliable. As much as I like these heaters, I can't afford to be replacing them constantly. I am looking for something else now. Perhaps something without a timer that can break so easily."
1,Worthless,"Korea has the worst reputation in terms of teaching jobs. Look up ""Korean school blacklist"" on Google and see the State Department's travel advisory on Korea - gives a lot more useful info than this piece of fluff."
4,Work Assignment,"This book was a work assignment - lead a discussion group of a summary of the book. After reading the summary, I wanted to read the entire book. It's short and to the point. I've always loved eagles, so the analogy was great for me."
3,A lil steep I reckon,"1st 2 songs are great pop numbers off their Real McCoy lp, there's 3 others that don't really stick out much, a messed up recording but good performance [I was @ the show I recall] of Outdoor type & to be honest I forgot what the others were but they were kind of moulded together. If it was regular single price, fine, but I can't see too many forking out full album price for it. Get Manilow or You Me Carpark Now though, local lazy classics."
3,Assumes Too Much Knowledge,"This text assumes much too much knowledge. You would either (A) Have had to work at Sun, or (B) program in Java with the web server all day to understand this book. I would consider myself an expert in Java, and I was not able to follow this book. Chapters 1 and 2 are good, but after that, they start talking about things that are meant for a part II or III. It's really too bad this book was so complex."
2,This Book Is For Dummys,"Should have been called ""Java Web Server For Dummies"" The book is so elementary, and poorly designed, it's sick. Don't buy this book unless you want to read the comics that are in there. Buy the Hunter book. You'll learn something at least."
2,This Book Is For The Java Fools,"I read this book. This book is meant for people who just want to learn about Java Servlets, and nothing else. The writing quality is poor, and the gammer is also quite poor. Too bad that this book turned out to be so poorly written, because the content may have been good."
1,Not a very robust presentation.,"Actually, my main comment on this book is that you can learn quite a lot. The examples are so imcomplete and buggy that working them out will really teach you a lot about servlet programming."
5,Strange reviews,"I find it strange that the only negative reviews I can find on this book are about the writing style. As if I wanted War and Peace with the Servlet API on the side. Unlike the Denver reader, I thought the writing style added, rather than hindered, the reading experience.And if ""recent college graduates"" scare you, sell your stock in Yahoo and stop running Linux. :D"
2,This Text Is Not Worthy Of Publication,"I thought that the ideas of this text were superior, the topics to be covered. I immediately purchased it. After reading Chapter 1, it become apparent that this text was written by incompetent authors, with large attitudes. The grammar was horrible. Sad..."
4,Nice Clock,A nice looking clock however the back edges are sharp and will scratch up the paint on walls leaving a silver-ish ring.
2,Did not care for it,"I was rather surprised how little I actually enjoyed this book given all the other marvelous reviews. I think it was the style in which it was written, it just never flowed easily for me with its ""Elizabethan cadence"" and the quoted poetry. And I really couldn't like the hero; regardless of how remorseful he was for how he treated the heroine it just wasn't enough considering all he put her through. I liked the heroine a bit better, although she, too, wore on me as the book went along. Yet aficionadas of medieval romance fiction will enjoy it for its historical depth and florid style."
2,Perhaps is the time period that I do not enjoy?!?,"... I found the dialogue to be rude and the period primative. I should probably stay away from 'mouse-like' heroine from now on because I just did not like Nora at all. She seems so spinless to me. Chirstian is no better - jumping to all the wrong conclusions without even investigating any of the possibilities. I was totally disgusted by the way he treated Nora espcially with other women. I have a real dislike for that type of childlish behavior. The story has a pretty simple plot with mouse-spy daring to save the kingdom and misunderstood by lover-husband as traitor. The way that Christian had to climb back to grace was touching, but I think that is too little, too late after what he put Nora through."
4,My first read by this author.,The story line was interesting. I looked up details from the period because of this story. I would read more books by this author.
3,"the good, the bad and the ugly","The year is 1558. Nora (who's shy & sweet) & Christian (who's bold & bawdy)are an unlikely match. Both are involved in Tudor court intrigue. I gavethe book 3.5 stars.GOOD ASPECTS1) Nora learns to be assertive & at times aggressive (defends self/others)as story moves forward.2) Her young Page, Arthur, is loyal and sweet.3) Christian is a yummy arrogant alpha male, w/ some vulnerabliity. Grovelhe does.NOT SO GOOD ASPECTS1) Hero verbally abuses heroine & is unfaithful D/T BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.2) Hero has 2+ bottles of ETOH on wedding night, still able to have sex. Huh?3) Modern words take away from story ie ""tricked out in a gown.."" (pg 35)""you're an old maid"" (pg 56) &""..the most accomplished player.."" (pg 232)etc.4) Nora thinks she's ugly most of the book. Enough already!!!"
5,High quality video!,"I was so impressed when I bought this video. It shows Ashkenazy from when he first arrived in England and playing with Barenboim and Harrell.You also get some lovely shots of when he arrived in Iceland.There is a superb section when he plays a Chopin recital in Belgium.You hear some wonderful playing in the background, then he comes in to the green room to meet his wife,after that he goes out and plays the complete Chopin Etude No.1 as an encore. What a thrill to listen and see that! There are also parts of Beethoven concerts etc. Also some very rare footage. I highly recommend this video!"
1,Complete Failure,"It does not work...don't buy it. I have tried it with multiple devices and multiple configurations, to no avail. A waste."
1,Very disappointing,This film is very disappointing. Everything is weak. Tchaikovsky fans will be perplexed by this terrible film. The story is confusing and hard to follow and the music is placed without any context. A wasted opportunity.
4,Interesting and Educational,Mr. Neuman's book was remarkable in his telling of how he has managed to overcome childhood and early adult abuse apparently to be a happy and well adjusted man.This book was most educational about the era in Germany immediately after WWII continuing with the problems still existing today. The book is also a peek at history in the USA in earlier years.Thank you Mr. Neuman
2,Flimsy,"Looks nice, but very fragile. Drawers are all a little uneven and barely held together with a few screws. Spend the extra money and something more sturdy."
3,Damaged cabinet,"I purchased 2 file cabinets, they were simple to put together and were of sturdy construction. The only problem was that one of the metal sides had a ding in it. I contacted the company and they agreed to replace the damaged part. Three weeks later and no part I called back only to find out that their number is disconnected."
4,getting organized,"I odered this fill cabine and it came faster than then I was told, that is always a good thing. Came in good shape and it was time to put together, it is not that hard, but when i got to the last drawer threads were missing in one side had to call Keda and have it shipped. They are not bad to deal with just not the fastest.If it would have came with out this problem I would have given it five stars. Looks good and work well over all I am happy."
4,"Great file cabinet, over priced here, I concur",I agree with the first review. This is a very attractive file cabinet and quite practical. I paid much less for it from the other seller. This is really overpriced.
3,"Good for the price, but the price is cheap","The good news is that this filing cabinet is a good value. The bad news is that the very low price means there were some fit & finish problems with the one I bought, mostly due to a bad weld on one component. All in all, I'd buy another if I need it, since I can't find anything equivalent for even twice the price but don't expect perfection at this price."
1,Avoid - poor manufacture,"Basically it looks ok and the aesthetic design is fine. However, the parts don't fit together, the side panel of the hanging file drawer was either damaged or poorly manufactured meanign the parts had to be forced together having hammered the thing into shape. Several of the screw hole did not line up and the draw fronts are insubstantial - unsuitable for screwing into. I could have been sent the Friday afternoon clunker but clearly the QC process isn't what it might be. The lesson is that filing cabinets are generally round the $200 mark. $100? I guess you get what you pay for. But even then - garbage."
5,Great Modern Look for Office,I have a small black ladder desk from Crate & Barrel so I need a nice 3 Drawer cabinet to put a printer on top and to organize my stuff.This look of this cabinet is perfect with the black and the steel and black glass. I love the look of the glass and you can lock the wheels so they don't go anywhere. The bottom drawer is perfect for files too! Great product!
4,Great cabinet for the price,Using it in a front office - had bought the desk at Office Depot. Can't beat the Amazon price.
2,pain in the *ss,"We haven't even put it together yet. There are so many steps and instructions for what we thought was a simple little piece of furniture that we are sorry we ever purchased it. It will probably look nice and be useful once it is assembled, but I'm not sure if that day will ever come."
1,scisandra berry,it makes many claims but dont work! ...... dont wast your money on this b.s. product! ..... it dont do nouthing!
3,East and West spirituality,"Though I found the contrast between east and west interesting, this book just didn't ""get"" me. It seemed heavy handed at times in what I saw as insistence that Eastern spirituality would be the ""saving"" of Western religious practices. Having read the book within a discussion group, I find it telling that there is not one phrase from it that stays with me.Normally after discussion, I would have something tucked away as a thought provoker or a spirtual vitamin. Not in this case."
4,"Great Gun, but a little loud.","When I first got the gun I thought the battery would have some charge in it and tried to fire it, it didn't work. You need to charge the battery pretty much overnight the FIRST time you charge it. It is a great gun, it shoots as hard or harder than what Amazon says it does (330 fps) and has a great rate of fire. The battery is really hard to wedge in the circular case where it goes, but after practice it becomes much easier. The Hop-Up knob is very nice if a bit sensitive. the 330 round mag is a godsend, you can just keep unloading at your targed. I havn't tried shooting it anybody but considering how fast the rounds fly comparing to my other gun, it'll sting.Pros:Mostly Metal330 round magazineGreat rate of fireSturdy constructionHop-Up is goodExtremely accurateCons:The battery is extremely hard to get in and out of the gunThe gun is VERY loudOverall I think the Pro's Far outweigh the Con's"
5,an amazing gun,"The accuracy is amazing, the power is unbelievable, ans the gun it self is just shweet. If you live on the east coast expect about a week for it to get to you. but anyway this gun is a must buy. All of the extras on it make it an awesome gun. this was by far the best investment ive ever done. so buy this gun or you'll be sorry you didn't when your friend is beating the crap out of you with it."
3,"Good, But Not Great","Upon recieving the gun, seemed okay, the gun was most definatly used, although reading other reviewers, some peeps have said that it was a pain to get the battery in and out of the barrel, which in return was true the pictures that ive uploaded will show you proof, and the gun that i recieved was super-glued seemed like a returned gun that in return was sent to me probably by mistake but nonetheless the gun worked and no complaints, although after a few modifications the gun actually impressed me by far considering how fake it looks from the outside the motor design is pretty decent and is worth the money, but, be warned, you will have to do some slight adjustments to get the battery to fit nice and good. the reason this gun is getting a three star rating from me is that the battery compartment is a pain to get together, take alook at the pictures and you will see how to fix that minor problem."
2,i think i got the wrong gun.,"I bought this gun for about 65 bucks from airsplat. if you look at the pictures of this gun at the top of the page. it shows 2 different guns one is the well m4 a1, one is the d-94. i ordered the m4 a1 and got the d-94 and the D-94 is less than half the gun the m4 a1 is. there is no compartment where the hop up is hidden, such as the photo shows at the top of the page, nothing happens when i pull the handel in the back, the handle just pops off. did every one else get the right one?"
2,Not Good,"When I opened the package for this gun i thought ""SWEET!!"". Turns out I was wrong. I spent an hour trying to get the battery in. When i shot it, it was pretty powerful and accurate. That didn't last very long. In about 4 months the gearbox completely jammed. I took it apart, but it still didn't work. Then I looked and it said 1 month warranty!! That is pretty cheap. I thought this gun was a good price ""WRONG!!!"" It is terrible for the price. Don't buy this gun because of the other reviews. Soon they will experience the same thing that I did. I recommend buying the ""AK47 assault rifle."" I got that gun a couple of months ago. The battery is easy to put in and it is very acurate. The gear box is well put together. They say that the m4 has a metal gear box, but that doesnt mean anything. The rest of the gun is made out of crappy plastic. The gearbox is losely put together. Now I have 1 thing to say. ""DONT BUY THIS GUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" FYI I am not Ann Underhill."
1,Do not buy if you want to keep $60-130 dollars...,"The gun came on the promised date. Couldn't wait to open it. Opened it and the stock fell off. They shipped me a crappy gun with a broken stock. The battery compartment is a pain in the *beep* to put on. The directions are horrible. Like, they aren't even on paper. They are unclearly printed on the back of the box. I was missing two of the rods, (Ram and unjamming) but still got the cleaning rod. Other than that, the gun so far is okay. The magazine is a bit hard to get in and out, but I am already used to it (after using it twice.) I have yet to use it in a war. Don't buy this gun if you want your $130 dollars. I have no clue why they raised the price on this crappy gun from $60 to $130. They must think we are idiots. Don't buy if your smart....."
1,terrible customer service,"This gun is amazing it is the best gun I ever owned, but it had a manufacture defect so I tried to send it back and here's what happened. Airsplat has the absoulute worst service that I have ever seen! They siad they would email me in 24 hours and it's been a month! I have also called them multiple times. I hate airsplat! Get this gun just not from airsplat."
2,complicated,Ok first of all it is impossible to put the battery in the gun. Second of all the magazine wont crank. The reason why I rated this 2 stars is because it looks cool.
1,Everything broken,"I ordered this gun from Airsplat along with 5,000 BB's and a speed loader. The bag with the BB's was split open at the bottom and all but 100 BB's were missing. The speed loader was snapped in half, completely useless. My gun would fire, but no BB's were loaded into the chamber to fire, so nothing came out. Do not order from Airsplat, the shipping is OK, but really expensive,and everything is broken. My friend ordered a gun from Airsplat and the barell of the gun was snapped off when he got it. Do not order from airsplat."
3,Matrix Style,"I bought 24 of these from an outlet store for 12 bucks. I first read these reviews. I got one of my BDU jackets, and then I stuck all of them in there. I could only fit 18 of them. They were all loaded. I then took the mags from all of the others and loaded them up for backup. I basicly pulled a matrix style stunt. I took out two of them, shot them, two more, shot them, etc. etc. The only difference was that I put them back in my pocket afterwards. I then kept one out and reloaded it with the 4 excess mags. It was a 12 on 12 battle. I got 4 of them. I had so much fun. Two of them broke a week later. And eventually affter about a month, I had about 10 of them left. So I got the mags, and handed the guns and mags out evenly to my teammates for sidearms. Overall, it is a pretty reliable gun when you have 18 of them. But damn was it fun. Don't buy 1 for this price."
1,Not worth the money or all the aspirin.,This piece of trash is way to disgruntled and literally takes forceable entry for the battery. Not only this but its instructions are not detailed enough and eventually you will throw this 50 dollar piece of junk across the room with no hope of ever taking a shot. Get an M16 so that the battery compartment is in the butt of the gun. the location for the battery is the worst placement ever.
1,disappointing,When I first got the gun it was exiting. After i charged the battery i took of the bottom barrel and they both came of and the little circle thing on the top that was suppose to be glued on was off i wasted hours trying to fix it. Then i finally realized that it was broken. I do not recommend this gun.
4,"Great gun, small flaws, overall great gun","I ordered this gun August 16th, and got it today, let me say this is a great buy for 100.00. I was waiting for it the entire day, when it showed up, the wait was definitely worth it. I took it out of the box, charged it up, and spent an hour test firing it. The firing was good, and very accurate, WITH my custom electric sight, which added on. However, the only flaws were the stock, which was a little loose, and putting the battery in the barrel. I feel like it is going to break whenever I put it in. So that scares me. Overall, this is a great airsoft rifle, and it is worth your money."
3,decent,Pros:- short- light weight- realistic- fast rate of fireCons:- loose or easly broken but fixable parts- very load- short battery life- not as powerful as advertizedoveral not a bad gun and for the price it is alright.
5,Great gun.,"I bought this gun about six months ago, and it is absolutely amazing, still to this day. Compared to the rest of my friends using other brands and AK's, and is a very light, compact rifle but still can reach out very accurately at about 150 feet, with .2's. I recommend using only .2's if you don't plan on being very close."
2,dont buy,i bought this gun because i wanted a small automatic gun just to shoot at my friendsjust noit lasted two days then the safty broke so you had to pull it out then press it to shoot and then the motor just started to make a grinding noise and it didnt work.the reason i gave it two stars is because it was fun to shoot for the two days i had it. the automatic was slow but that doesnt matter because ur not gonna buy this gun anyway.
1,"Don't buy this gun, at least not from HotImporttoys.","So i thought i had a good deal on my hands until my gun came after around 8 days and the motor was broken.i contacted the hot import toys support and they nearly ran out the 30 day warranty until they finally the go ahead and shipped it to them.When i got it back (today) after waiting about another 1.5 months, i expected a working gun with no problems.it seems that the slide has no spring in it and will therefore almost never open up the compartment where the hop up adjuster is. i thought this wasn't a big deal at the time but you have to adjust the hop up.also the gun jams every 4-5 bullets.Do not buy this gun, at least from hot import toys."
1,Rip Off!!!,"It broke after 4 times using it, broken stalk and it wont fire!!! GARBAGE!!! To make matters worse my 30 day gaurntee is up and im out of my $100!!! I tried to find the return address and there was none...I will never buy this product again!!!"
1,Horrible Gun,"This gun is absolutely terrible. The battery takes really long to charge, it is kind of low powered and I got it from Airsplat which is a very bad airsoft company. The gun is pretty much all plastic except for the barrel. When I shot a bb, it took a 45 degree turn to the right and I wasn't doing anything wrong. I cleaned the barrel out and there was nothing in it. It should have been working perfectly. The battery caseing is extremely hard to deal with but eventually I got pretty good at it and it wasn't much of a problem. Then the next problem was the stock of the gun fell off randomly when I was running. Fortunately the stock doesn't affect the shooting of the gun but it made the gun look really stupid and the stock really helps for aiming. I would say this gun is about 50 ft. for range with .12 gram bbs. I was a very big mistake to buy this gun. If you want to buy an airsoft gun, look elsewhere, the places like [...]"
2,Horrible quality,"This product is made of cheap plastic. It has broken for me twice. The first time was a blown fuse. Second is a mystery, but likely a gearbox issue. If you want an electric gun that shoots really hard and straight for 5 minutes, get this. If you want great accuracy and FPS for years, get an Echo 1."
2,Looks O.K. but isnt good at all!,"I bought this gun to go along with my MP5A5 when I was just starting airsoft, it was good for about 2 days. but after no more than maybe 50 shots when i pulled the trigger the blowback motor just made a weird grinding sound. So i sent it back, I got a replacement and shot it and it was like the gun had 50 fps and the bb barley came out of the gun so I decided not to get another replacement or refund, because I would have payed more to ship it back than the refund would have been...when it comes down to it, the 17$ clear walmart spring pistol i have shoots 10 times better than this gun. I know most kids like me crave an automatic pistol just because it is soooo cool, but you would be better off going to shortyusa.com, hobbytron.com, or airsplat.com, or just your local airsoft, sporting goods, even walmart stores to get a better gun than this.DO NOT BUY, VERY DISSAPPOINTING!!!"
3,good gun but took to long to ariv,i would have gave it all five stars but it took over a mounth to get here. The gun can shoot and break skin at 30 feet a way. It has a good weight and is very relalistic. i hope you like this review and DON'T GET THIS GUN FROM AIRSPALT.
1,Terrible,I give this a 1 star because I ordered this from Airsplat. The shipping took a hell of a long time. The metal on the strap that comes with the gun breaks like lead on a pencil. But the gun itself is great. Its pretty accurate and pretty loud. But do not order this from Airsplat if you're planning on getting one. The service is terrible. Would of given this better ratings if it was delivered on time and in better condition.
1,The gun was terrible,"It says the gun is new, but when I got it the rail mount for the sight was broken in half, and the box, which had been opened before, was full of holes from being shot at with BB's. There were no instructions for charging the gun, the charger didn't work with the battery. The gun has 250 - 280 fps, not 350 - 380 fps. Thanks for ripping me off guys."
1,this gun sucks,"ok when i first got this gun on xmas it rocked. but then latter that afternoon when it was done charging angain, the stock just fell off. the company did adout nothing to help. finally i just sent it back for them to repare. after about 3 weeks i got it back. it worked good again in the beginning but then it just stop shooting. i fond out some of the wires disconected so i put them back but it still didnt work. hotimport toys wont let me reteren it, all they'll let me do is send it back for a replasment. do not buy this gun. it is a wast of money. all the good revews are lyes."
1,Don't order on-line,"I pay $79.97(total)bought this rifle,it working but no BB going out.I don't think the rifle is new.I want to return it,but the company will charge 15% restocking.Also I need to pay shipping,you see...... How much I lost? Don't buy."
3,Plenty of bang bang but not enough pew pew,"True, this gun is excellent for leaving a welt on your friend in the yard. But what if your friend was wearing galactic body armor? Then what?"
1,this gun sucks,"beleive me. this gun sucks. all well guns are bad and most of them have under 200fps, im sure this one does. what ever prize they put on this gun, its probably too high so instead of spending your money on a gun that doesn't weigh anything and looks really bad, get something for over $100 at a site that is only about selling airsoft guns.worst gun ever."
3,It is ok,The gun has a. Nice look and feel but you have to have the clip wound up very high. You can only get out 4-5 shots but you have to wind up the little gear again.
1,Good looking crap gun,"This gun looks and sounds amazing, but its crap, i ordered it,took forever to get here, plus the battery it comes with is crap and dies in five minutes, the front sight came crooked, it does have great range but it doesnt last long, it'll just stop working when you least expect it."
2,Bad Gun,"I bought this gun over 6 months ago, it worked for about 1 week, then just stopped firing... After we got it working again after 3 months it worked for another month. After a month, the gun started jamming and making a screeching sound when you tried to fire. We still haven't Fixed it!!!! Overall, good gun while it worked, but broke easily. I would recommend it... but since it is HORRIBLE when it comes to reliability, NEVER BUY THIS GUN!!!"
2,review,"This product needs to have a bigger space for the battery. Once you take off the black plastic cover, it is hard to snap it back because of no space for battery."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i got this gun and i was all haapy. I get the battery charged and im shooting it i decide to move the stock and it all together brackes off! I can live with that but i mean come on. the next day im out side shooting it on semi-auto, I switch it to full-auto I pull the trigger and nothing it stopped working out of no where. all and all it looks good shoots fast, and straight but it broke the second day i had it so I say it is a waste of money!!!!"
3,ok,"This was also overpriced. Again I thought I was purchasing ""Hot Wheels"" brand. I could have purchased this same item at Walmart for half the price."
4,accurate and fun,"Because of torrential rains I only had the chance to do one of the walks in this book on my visit to Italy this past October--from Ripa d'Orcia to Bagno Vignoni--but it was one of the highlights of my trip. I found the directions to be painstakingly accurate, which was surprising to me considering that this book was published 3-1/2 years ago. Walking from place to place and then eating delicious local cuisine is a wonderful way to explore Italy and I'd love to return and do other walks from this book."
3,Beautiful walk but the milage given had to be incorrect.,"We just returned from a trip to Tuscany and Umbria where we took one of the walks, actually we took 1/2 of one of the walks. We planned to walk from Montepulcina to Pienza stopping at Montechelli for lunch. The book said it was 3 1/2 miles to Montechelli and another 3 1/2 miles to Pienza. It took us 4 hours to walk to Montechell. The walk was beautiful and the directions exact. There were four of us all in good shape but the walk was more exhausting than we expected, given the discription in the book. We knew we could not continue on to Pienza. Montechelli is tiny pristine town without public transportation, but with wonderful people, one of whom gave us a ride back to Montepulcina. I would recomend this book for anyone interested in walking in the area but my experience is to double the amount of time they expect the walks to take ."
5,Oustanding guide for those who like to walk and like to eat!,"We've used the earlier version of this guide for two wonderful trips to Tuscany; one in late September and one in early May, so we got to enjoy both the grapes on the vines and the spring flowers.I cannot reccomend this guide enough and have given it to several friends--forget renting a car, this is absolutely the BEST way to see and experience Italy and meet the people. The information provided is extremely detailed, the walks are gorgeous and the food is, of course, delicious. An added plus is that if you spend this much time walking, you can eat pretty much all you want and NOT gain any weight! Bravo!My only complaint is that there aren't more guides like this for the rest of Italy!"
2,"Great title, lousy content","I bought this book expecting it to be our guide for wonderful culinary and walking adventures in Tuscany. The descriptions are incomplete,(e.g. there is directions on how to go in one direction but not how to return). The only good thing about this book was the adventures that evolved while we were lost looking for the trails described. Italy appears to have a well mapped national trail system, however due to our lack of Italian and the inability to decipher when the National Park offices were open, we were unable to acquire the maps and corresponding documentation. I would suggest that this information be included rather than the chaotic and hit or miss selections included in the book.The book was pretty worthless. I abandoned it in my villa, not worth carrying home."
1,Out of date and inaccurate,We tried to do some walks based on the instructions in this book and found it very out of date. In some places the author suggests doing a one way walk and taking a taxi back - Sibillini - there is absolutely no way anyone could find a taxi at the end of the walk. Don't buy this book unless you want to get lost. We also went a restaurant the book recommended in Radda and it was the worst restaurant we ate in for the full two week vacation! I have thrown the book in the trash.
3,Fair Movie,"A fair movie with good stars,but it is lacking in something. The movie stars Angela Mao,Carter Wong,Cassanova Wong and Chen Sing.The plot revolves around finding a missing Japanese Shoguns pearl. Summary of this movie - Great Stars but only Fair Movie."
4,Best in over a decade,"everybody look out Flotzilla is back!!! Flotsam and Jetsam havent sounded this good in years. The only drawbacks are the albums length, and it's production. the production on this album is good enough, though it seems to change a bit throughout the course of the cd. Flotsam and Jetsam are definately moving in the right direction. a few more killer fast and groovy tracks and maybe the Andy Sneap treatment and we're gonna see a full on Flotsam assault, sure to crush everything in it's path."
1,more garbage,This band is a lot like AC/DC in the sense that they keep the same format for every album. Starts out passable and goes to garbage quick.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"No joke, it's the worst mix in music history. The entire CD is MONO. Yep. All the main rhythm guitars are MONO. Everything is centered and crap. Sounds like there is ONE guitar. They literally went from one of the best mixes in metal history (My God) to the worst in one CD jump. Truly baffling.Before anyone claims I'm ignorant... I'm an audio engineer. I know what I'm talking about. AVOID THIS CD LIKE THE PLAGUE!Only buy this CD if you are DEAF in one ear."
2,review from the Synthesis,"There's a time when you have to sigh, reluctantly resign and surrender your place of fame to some promising up-and-comers. This isn't necessarily an age issue; it's more about what is relevant. Some things are happening now; other things, like this latest release from Flotsam and Jetsam, were happening about 10-15 years ago. Everything about it is typical: the power metal riffs, the very Metallica-esque vocals, the same old guitar solos, the relentless drumming, the classic and consistent thrash metal sound, lyrics about demons and dreams and even the standard ballad. So guys, it seems to be about that time. As Buddha says, ""Like every living thing, in the end it sickens and dies.""Bonnie J. BaileySynthesis.net"
5,Good and Well-organized,"Well organized, scientific, and full of useful material. What else do you need?!"
3,It's a good book for beginners,"It's a good book for beginners, but the CD doesn't show the examples of the book!"
1,Recorded CD doesn't match the book's examples.,"I just purchased ""The Contemporary Arranger"" written by Don Sebesky. The CD containing the recorded examples that come with the book don't match the track listing on pages viii & ix. The example numbers (Ex.) can't be found on the page numbers. I went to the publisher's web site looking for a corrected track list of the right example numbers and pages of where they can be found in the book, but I couldn't find it, nor do I see them list this book. Otherwise, it looks like a fine book."
2,I Love My Wife,The print is fading and the adhesive is letting go and it's been on my truck for only two months.
2,Why make this?,"I thought this movie was a new uncut movie, but unfortunately, it wasn't. It took 2 episodes out of volumes 5 and 6 in the supers season, and they left one out of each!.This makes me not wanna buy the fifth movie. I also got the sixth uncut movie with this, so it wasn't worth getting.In the first episode:Hawk's Eye and Tiger's Eye both target Mina at the same time.In the second episode;A woman who's beenwaiting for her soulmate... get's targeted.The rest of the episodes you can get on Dark Pegasus."
4,I'm Straining here!,"Very nice and useful tool for the sink. I leave it out on the sink always. Strains hot foods like steamed vegetables and noodles.Always available with plenty of room to rinse salad and fresh produce. and yeah have used it to dry small washed items like utensils, spoons and forks. It can sit on table supported by it own footed stand. I take it to my garden. Pick my veggies and herbs and take them straight to the sink to rinse. Now this is what I call a useful tool."
4,It's a strainer.,The ability to extend the handles such that it rests on the walls of the sink is nice. Hard to clean the fine mesh. It's a strainer.
3,Wish the holes were a little smaller.,I have had this for years and I like the fact that I can hang it over the sink but rice gets wedged in the mesh and underneath the lip.
4,What you see is what you get,"Works as advertised. Fits on the sink, drains stuff, good price. What more could one ask for?"
5,you can't beat quality,"My daughter was desperate for a strainer and she got TWO for her Birthday, one from her husband and this from me. The one from her husband was the rubber pop-up kind and seemed to be better suited until it broke after only a couple of months. She called to tell me that this was working beautiful and how glad she was I had purchased it for her. Goes ino the dishwasher, the stainless is study and no rust, it is a little bulky to store but she has tons of space so this is a keeper."
1,Don't BUY IT... PLEASE,"I hate this item. The dirts always HIDE behind the 2 cm stainless edge. Enlarge the picture of this item and you will see the stainless around the edge of strainer. If this product doesn't have stainless edge, I might recommend this item.However, the stainless steel mesh is very very very difficult to clean and the dirts won't come off that easily. I have to use more water than usual item.Yesterday I washed spinach leaves, and today I washed rices, both of small pieces are still on the strainer espeically behind the stainless egde.I would recommend to use the normal plastic or silicon strainer."
1,Almost cool,"I love the size of this and the way it's arms can extend over my sink. However, the metal rim that goes around the top of this catches food all the time.There is a gap between the rim and the mesh large enough to catch large pieces of food (over 1/4"") It is nearly impossible to get clean and sanitized. The last time I used it I was tapping it to get the water out of the macaroni I was straining and some sort of moldy glump fell out of the rim into the macaroni. I had to throw out the whole mess, including the strainer. I'm not going to put up with accidentally food poisoning my family."
1,Inferior product,The metal slider arms do not slide back and forth smoothly...they are constantly catching on the metal shaft. Very inferior product that I would not spend $20 for.
4,Sturdy and durable,"I've been using this for a few weeks now to hold small parts in my sandblasting cabinet. So it's more than sturdy enough for kitchen use! I'm very pleased with it, the grips can extend out fairly wide or collapse back down to make it easier to handle."
5,nice extendable arms!,"purchased this for my wife for xmas, wife like it then she noticed the extendable arms which she loved. can span sink opening, trash can opening with comfort grips and bottom stand for stability. Good Buy!"
2,"Maybe I got a bad batch, but fresh brewed tastes sour","I use paper filters for my coffee and clean my Melita drip cone after every use, yet every single cup I've had of this coffee has tasted sour as if there was a little bit of spoiled coffee from improper cleaning. I know that is not the case because I have four different types of coffee and this is the only one that tastes this way. I was disappointed after hearing good things about the Gevalia brand."
1,"Chessy,sappy,lame dreck!!!!!","Generally, one or two tunes like this will turn up on a rock artists album, but this baby is cheesy,sappy,lame hair metal dreck from start to finish... and did I mention the lyrics - absolutely abismal!If you like this kind of stuff (and somebody must, because this record saw the light of day), then go ahead and enjoy..."
2,THE RISE AND FALL OF THE WHIG PARTY,"A MASSIVE WORK WHICH BECAUSE THE AUTHOR FOCUSES ON STATE BY STATE DETAILS BECOMES TEDIOUS AND REPETETIVE. THE FOCUS ON MINUTIA PREVENTS THE READER FROM APPRECIATING THE CONTEXT OF THE WHIG PARTY'S PLACE DURING THAT TURBULANT ERA OF ITS EXISTENCE. PROF HOLT HAS WRITTEN A REFERENCE WORK FOR THE SPECIALIST, BUT FOR THIS GENERALIST NON-PROFESSIONAL WHO PLOWED THROUGH ALL 1200 PAGES, IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT"
2,Not a good purchase....,"Arrived heavily packaged in peanuts, which was a chore to unpack. The tree arrived dry and despite my daily mistings and watering, has turned rather crispy. I bought a smaller one from a different vendor and that one is thriving and growing. Overall, very disappointing for the money and compared to the other one an inferior product. Would not waste my money again!"
2,"Of all the kids books, this one I remember.",I was delighted that Amazon actually had this book listed. Somehow I remember this one of all the ones I read. The title always intrigued me and echoed for many years. What I would give to read it again.
1,Came defective,"I bought this watch as a gift for my son who is recovering from major surgery. I bought it five weeks ago. He did not open the gift until yesterday and the clasp is defective. Amazon won't allow me to return the watch because it is over 30 days. This is not ""prime"" customer service."
2,Language!!!!,"Started this book and thought it was going to be good....but...I do not like to read the f word all the time. There are many wonderful words in our English language, why use this one so often. Did not finish the book."
1,Not my style,"Book is not my style, language vulgar, story line may be good, but the langauage and no story line , except sex really turned me off."
2,Dragon's Kiss,"Mostly poorly written porn trash. 90% sex and 10% storyline. Would not reccomend to anyone. I like scifi, but this was poorly done."
5,WOW that is hot,"Very hot and steamy, with a good story line in there to pull in together. I found it much too steamy to read anywhere except home alone. But I couldn't put it down, The storyline was excellent, and creative. I cant wait to read the rest!"
3,Incredible,Unbelievable exploits from an over active mind preoccupied with incredible sexual exploits. Oversexed Dragon/king and a nymphomaniac lover engaging in impossible activities.
2,Cool watch,"Got this watch because I used to be mesmerized as a child by my dad's Bulova or Armitron digital watches from the 70's and early 80's. The case looks like it's made out of die cast metal which easily gets scratched. Didn't use it too often because it bugged me that I had to push a button to see what time it was...but then again, this was a novelty purchase. Watch had sad end when clueless girl at jewelery shop left case open when I took it to change batteries. Watch guts got oxidized. Don't recommend for daily use."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"This book is great! I started out pretty sceptical of some ofthe very subtle ques this book talks about, but after a littleexperimentation and practice I'm impressed. Some of this is common sense, but there are a lot of signals I was sending and receiving that I never realized."
1,The Sad Truth,"It should be noted by any who would be willing to buy a DVD like this that George Alexander has no affiliation with Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu (the the fighting style of Miyamoto Musashi). I honestly cannot challenge the effectiveness of anything Alexander attempts to teach the viewer of this DVD, but I can challenge it's authenticity in regards to being the fighting style of Miyamoto Musashi."
1,"fat, slow and inaccurate. Musashi must be rolling over in his grave.","I am sorry to say that I actually own this. I believe that if one is to demonstrate the techniques of Musashi one must honor him by doing the movements without supplemental Oxygen. A true practitioner understands that if one is out of shape then one cannot continue the battle. Alexander breathes heavily through the entire DVD that some of it is hard to understand. His cuts are slow and awkward like a novice, a total fish out of water. Anyone that thinks that his cuts are impressive are clueless. Cutting sticks does not show ones ablity to cut, a cheap alternative to Goza or Tatami are water bottles. If one is able to pass a blade through a water bottle without disturbing it understands the principles of cutting. Do myspace search for jaime_avalos@hotmail.com to watch a real cut! How can you sleep at night knowing that you put out such garbage? Musashi must be rolling over in his grave!!!!"
3,Not the best VBA book,"I was very impressed with this book for about the first 3 chapters. As I got into the more code-oriented sections, I became less impressed. This book contains tons of great information, but it is often hard to get to. The author is too wordy when trying to make his points so the important things tend to get lost. There are lots of code examples in the book but not good ones. The author frequently follows his examples by saying 'you will never do this' and then gives the reason why. I would prefer examples that I might actually be able to use some day even if they are harder to understand. He does have terrific exercises at the end of each chapter. I learned more from doing the exercises then I did reading the chapters.I think any one who reads this book and does all the exercises will have a good basis for writing VBA, but I also think you could do better by getting the latest edition of Power Programming Techniques by John Walkenbach."
1,Predictable tripe,"Wow, you'll be hard pressed to find a more cliched and do-it-by-the-numbers comic. And that's saying a lot. This 'manga' (it wasn't made in Japan so it's really stretching the definition)involves an idiotic claims adjuster, Jeremy, who is being framed for fraud by his best friend, Jake. When he finds out, what does he do??? Appologizes for tearing up Jake's office looking for proof and helps him clean it up, then takes one of Jake's cases to make up for it. There is no suspense, tension, or intrigue in this dull and flacid book. The plot obvious and the characters all act like they have the intellegence of preschoolers. If you're looking for something creative, entertaining, or interesting, look elsewhere."
4,antique clock repairing,"As a beginner in clock repair I found this book to be invaluable. Although there is alot of technical information, which isn't necessary to an amateur, I have been able to repair 7 mantel clocks which could not have been fixed by 'trial and error'. This book really gives on insight to the internal workings of mechanical clocks and should be in any amatuers library."
3,Clock Repair Handbook review,"The book arrived quickly, and in good shape. The book has a lot of good information, with clear diagrams."
4,Baby G Solar...big for a womans watch but great!,"It is a beautiful watch....Solar/Atomic/metal band/ It has a great look...and I played with the automatic light of the dial when you turn your wrist quickly. It is a neat feature..no button to push in the dark! It is a quality watch that I love. I will say though, it is big for a woman's watch. So if you have a very small wrist, or are very dainty, I don't this this is the watch you want. There isn't much out there for woman and solar/atomic. It is smaller than a man's atomic, but not much...The watch arrived on time, in good condition and ready to wear.It has great features. Be sure to set the time zone when you get it."
3,mimisthebest,"Paper seems to be of good quality. Graphic seems a bit hazy, not as detailed or colorful as expected. Overall, a good value for the price."
2,Determine if it is a CD or a Book before buying,"I now have three of these CDs. I wanted just a book, and it is not always clear that you get a CD and only a CD. I eventually got a book. The purpose of this CD is simply to let you know what the notes sound like. The book is great."
4,Easy Read,"I found this book because of a Walker Texas Ranger episode that mentioned it and the quote that was used on the show sounded like something I wanted my son to read.I bought the book thinking that there might be some ""words of wisdom"" that might help him in life and in competition.While the writing is simplistic, it is in a good way. It makes it easy to apply the principles being taught to almost every facet of life.I think it could be a useful aid for any young person that is competing in any type of martial arts. My son is competing in fencing and his advice still translates well.I think it could be a good book also for anyone struggling with anger management issues, assuming they are willing to read it."
1,Worse. Book. Ever.,"I had to read this for a college English class. This book was lousy. It was poorly written, and filled with mindless ramblings. There was no real arch of progression, and the diction seemed straight out of the likes of teenage romance books."
5,Chuck Norris for...,"I bought this book after it was recommended to me not knowing what to think. Wow this book had a ton of information but was still written simply. In a nutshell Chuck talks about what it has taken for him over his own lifetime to learn different disciplines of martial arts. In this book Chuck also talks about Qi energy and how he has used it. Overall this is a great read for someone who is interested in Chucks story, his disciplines or just becoming a better person."
4,Worth reading,"Being a Chuck Norris fan his book ""The Secret Power Within"" was enjoyable and an easy read. Chuck told stories that were touching and poignant. He talked about Zen and Meditation which help him keep his cool in the ring and in life. I saw him win the World Championship in Dallas where in the preliminaries he knocked out ten competitors with no signs of nervousness or fear. Chuck is a true champion in the ring and in life."
5,"An Excellent Book, Even if You Don't Do Martial Arts!","I recently re-read this book after an initial reading in 1997 or 1998. When I first read it, I was interested in exploring Martial Arts and found it to be quite interesting.A few days ago, I picked it up again and was pleasantly surprised at how well the book had stood the test of time. Part biography and part philosophical exposition, this work has good, practical advice for living and facing struggles in the ring, workplace and home. It is a nice introduction to Zen and also provides an interesting look at the author's personal struggles. The writing style is lucid and easy to follow.It is brief, easy to read, but thought-provoking."
3,Warmed -over Hyams Review Comment,"I have a comment on the person who wrote the ""Warmed -over Hyams, May 14, 2004"" review (actually a comment on that person's comments :-)The person the commentor mentions, Joe Hyams, is also Chuck Norris' biographer (Helped Chuck Write ""The Secrets of Inner Strength"".) So after having looked at both, I am not sure who really borrowed from who.It sounds like they have both worked together and may have exchanged stories. My guess is Chuck re-used stories he and Joe had discussed. But of course, we will not know ntil someone asks Chuck or Joe."
3,wow,I should have realized when people said that this book was very difficult to read not to buy. This book is for people who have doctorate in theology.
3,Instructions do help !,"There were no detailed instructions as how to use this item. It may work well but without instructions, it isn't worth alot !"
5,"Sleek, functional travel alarm","When this travel alarm arrived, it was a little bigger than I thought it would be, but overall I'm very happy with it. It's got a sleek metallic look that's very attractive. More importantly, it's very easy to use: I could easily set the date, time, alarm, etc. without glancing at the instructions (and I'm usually no whiz at these things!) I've owned smaller travel alarms in the past, but their control buttons were often too tiny for my fingers, and using the functions often baffled me; this Polder alarm is really user-friendly. Also, I like the fact that it runs on one AAA battery, so replacing the battery is a snap."
5,"Not as good as original, but a must for any fan!","I enjoyed the episodes. A glut of ghost type stories, but interesting nevertheless. Just as with the originals, there are some chapters that are better than others, and some that are just plain weak."
1,Great series - poor picture quality... :-((,"The series ist great, but the picture quality is very poor. It looks like a cheap VHS tape...The series was filmed on 35mm, but edited on video. Very stupid...CBS, please make a new master from 35mm (like STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION)...Please make also a blu-ray release (HD) with a new master!"
5,Buy the package deal,"I bought season one because back in the 80's there must have been some competing show I was watching, like Cheers or whatever. So I never got to see a great revived series. There are a few yawners, but by and large it is an excellent collection."
1,Nothing like Season 1; very boring,"For some reason, I can't seem to remember ever even seeing Season 2-3 of the The New Twilight Zone back when it was on TV. Season 1 was very good and enjoyable to watch. Season 2-3 is nothing like season 1. The stories are poorly written and really do not even have that signature ""Twilight Zone"" touch to them that you find in the original series or even season 1. I can honestly say that there only a handful of stories (3 or 4 at most) that are worth watching in this set. For the most part, you will just find yourself fast-forwarding or just skipping through most of the set.As a fan of the original Twilight Zone and season 1, I found myself quite disappointed and it's a shame Season 2-3 wasn't worth it.Read the customer reviews and decide for yourself."
3,A worthy successor to Rod Serling's vision,"The 1980s revival of ""The Twilight Zone"" had some memorable moments that would stand out in the minds of its viewers. While it did offer some changes (i.e. The Grateful Dead offering its version of the classic theme), all-in-all it was a good follow-on to the classic 1960s series. Purchase it if you are a die-hard TZ fan - if not, its worth a weekend rental."
3,modern versions of the Twilight Zone,"I love the twilight Zone episodes. Prior to purchasing seasons1-3 of the 1985-1988 series of the Twilight Zone, I vaguely remember these episodes. After watching each one, there were some of the episodes that I liked and some that I didn't. I must admit that the remake of Night of the Meek was not as moving as the orginal version. If you are an big fan of the Twilight Zone series- purchase this collection."
2,It works for us but not anymore,I read other reviews that say dust get in the fan and stops it. This is true but all you have to do is use a vacuum (the more powerful the better) or do what I do and use compressed air to blow it out. I take it off the wall and unplug it before I do anything. I usually have to do this around once a year. If I don't the unit will turn on but shut itself off after the sensor inside sees that it is getting to hot with the fan not working. I owned mine for about 4 years now and it still works.I do agree that they should have put a bigger fan in it and they also should have put spacers that you can stick on ether side on the back so it will fit snug to the wall. I used pads for wall spacers. These pads normally go under furniture to keep the furniture from markup the wood floors. These pads seems to work very good as wall spacers for me. (put the pad in the back behind both diodes on both sides) it works for about 2 years before it died on us.
1,cheap heater,"We had this heater mounted in our bathroom for 1 winter before it died. It gets dust in the rear intake where the fan blade is. It doesn't take very much dust to stop the fan blade from spinning, in turn, causing the heater to overheat and smoke. It's a shame, I thought for $60.00 it would be a higher quality heater. It really is not."
1,"Bad, bad product.",Does not heat a room as advertised....Very clumsy device...just a bad all around product.
1,DeLonghi Bathroom Heater,"It should be clear in the Amazon presentation of this product that it is for wall mounting only. Had I known that, I would NOT have ordered it. Thanks!"
1,***BEWARE MADE IN CHINA***,"I ordered this heater expecting the usual high quality Delonghi Made in Italy product. Well, I received neither! First this is not a high quality product nor is it made in Italy. The heater is cheap chinese junk!! Do not waste your time nor your money."
4,I want to hear more,"If you like Fiona, then this lady is for you. She even does a cover of Fiona's Living in a boys world. Hence the title. She has soul and emotion. This CD has a good sound. Well done. Not like the stuff that passes for music today. It is a shame that she and others didn't get any airplay. I love the 80s and miss the music of that time."
5,"I really injoy this song, it has real life scenarios.",My review of this cd is it has real life problems. And it would be a lot better if real people could understand this before they make this mistake. So this song should be listened to because it is a great learning tool.
5,YOU WON'T REGRET THIS PURCHASE,"THIS WALL MOUNT IS MADE WELL AND VERY STRONG. VERY EASY INSTALLATION. LOOKS VERY GOOD IN APPEARANCE, AFTER INSTALLATION. I GIVE THIS WALLWALL MOUNT 10 STARS."
5,Just as advertised,All of the reviews I read about the product being very durable and well made were true and the price was great.
3,"Not really for a 27"" TV","I purchased this item for my 27"" TV only to find out that 27"" refers to the width of the cabinet, not the screen size. If the TV cabinet is wider than 27"" it can't be rotated to the 90 degree position because the cabinet hits the wall bracket unless the TV is located off center on the shelf. Similarly if the TV is deeper than 20 inches there may be a problem fitting on the shelf or rotating. A minor problem for my set but it may be an issue for larger cabinets. Another problem was that the slots for the safety strap are located too far towards the front of the shelf and which could permit the TV to tip over even with the strap in place. You can see the slots in the photo of the shelf. I added a couple of clips towards the back of the shelf to position the strap for more security. I didn't use the slots as shown in the instructions.Other than that the mount appears sturdy enough for the recommended weight and is easy to assemble and install."
5,TV Stand,"Well constructed tv shelf unit. Put together in a few minutes, and it isa very strong unit. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Cheap and Well Made!,"This mount is solid and I have had zero problems since I mounted it a year ago. It is holding a 19"" TV in my daughters room and has yet to worry me about falling down. I periodically check to make sure it is still level and not once have I had to adjust it."
1,Don't use for a large TV!,"I used this for a 27"" TV--heavy, but not above the recommended weight. After about 4 months, the bolt sheared and TV crashed to the floor."
3,not bad,"I was craving fig bars without the unhealthy & artificial ingredients. These were definitely edible, not bad at all - but by no means amazing or addictive. I won't buy them again because the price seems way too high for the size package (when you factor in shipping and it is about $9 for a pack that is about the same size as the fig newton brand packs)"
3,Weak Gethryn,"One of the author's more forgettable tales. The unprovable impossible murder of Mrs. Hale-Storford provokes the wholesale massacre of the cardboard cut-outs staying in the house, one of them by a good method which John Rhode would later expand on in In Face of the Verdict, but, despite its extreme shortness, the book runs out of steam well before the end, becoming a thrillerish manhunt with much rushing about by rail and car, rather than ratiocination and deduction. The solution to the original ""murder"" turns out a disappointment."
3,An Enjoyable DVD for Archaeologists,"I am disappointed with this DVD. When I learned about the title, ""The Secrets of Genghis Khan"", I expected that I would be entertained with his genius in tactics and strategies. After all, Genghis Khan is the greatest conqueror in history. Both Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great had their setbacks but, Genghis Khan has never been defeated in the field. Instead, we are treated with a brave visionary leads over a team across the steppe of Mongolia on a quest to discoiver the lost tomb of Genghis Khan. This team, led by Maury Kravitz from America was a total fiasco. This DVD is fraught with archaeological details but contains nothing about the majesty and greatness of Genghis Khan. If you are an archaeologist or a prospective archaelogist, you might enjoy it. If you look for the grandeur of Genghis Khan's feats, forget it."
4,Gets the job done,At a cheap price the USB U-8 gets the job done. The little problem I had with is that it hardly fits into the USB slot on my camera. It's a little bulky on the end that goes into by camera.
4,Cam Cord!,I had never bought something off the internet .. this came QUICK and in perfect shape - and my camera is charged and breathing ;0) so it does the job!
1,Returning it right away.,"It will not work with a Kodak EasyShare c183, so don't even waste your time trying. Shipping was fast, but very disappointed that they don't have it listed which ones it doesn't work with, would have saved me tons of trouble and time."
1,Garbage!,"It took significanlty longer to arrive than other items ordered at the same time, and when it finally got here, it didn't even work. I'm not even going to bother returning it. I just want nothing more to do with it."
1,Breaks after use,This is the second cable I have ordered from the same vendor. Each one breaks after the second use. Silver end that plugs into camera bends and pulls out of plastic part of cord. I was EXTERMELY careful with the second one after having had this happen to the first one.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.Going to order one straight from Kodak and bypass the hope that an off brand/maker is just as good.
1,Didn't Work,"I lost my charger for my Kodak M863, so I ordered this. It simply didn't work. Plugged into camera and nothing."
1,not to my liking,This was the second time purchasing this item and none worked this item is very faulty
3,does not fit the camera,"What I did not know is that this data cable does not fit the camera itself. You need to purchase an adapter that fits into the camera, and then connect the data cable to the adapter in order to use it."
5,great product,I needed a new USB cord so I could sell my camera. A friend suggested Amazon.com and now just days later and less than $3 from my wallet I have a new cord and a happy new owner of my camera.
2,yes it work,"yes i like the cable cord i help a lot, and am able to share my picture with friends and family over the internet"
4,Camera USB interface,"Good USB interface. It not only works with my Kodak camera, but also with my trail camera for hunting. Great product at an exceptional price plus fast shipping."
4,:),"I lost the charger for my Kodak M340. I went to Best Buy (where I purchased the camera about 2 years prior) and they told me I had to special order it directly from Kodak. After hearing that, I thought I'd be spending at least $20, so finding this on Amazon for about $5 after shipping was awesome! It arrived about 3 days after ordering it, which was just in time for graduation. :)"
4,it works.it works.it works.,"worked the first time I used it. I is an aftermarket, not the Kodak trademark, it works. it works.it works."
1,Not compatible with Kodak Easyshare.,Wrong U-8 cable for Kodak Easyshare. Either there is more than one U-8 cable style or it is defective. It will not fit this camera. Amazon showed this item as frequently bought together with the USB AC adapter I bought. Do not buy this cable for Kodak Easyshare. I did not bother to return it because it was very cheap.
2,Only works on 1 of my 2 PCs??,"I have 2 PCs, 1 is a desktop that 1 1/2 years old and another is a laptop that 1 year old. The wire only works on the laptop?? Both are USB2. The original wire from Kodak worked fine on both."
1,USB Kodak Cable,It took forever for the cable to arrive. Eventually when it did after several emails and phone calls - it was the wrong cable! Did not fit. In the process of tryng to find the correct one and return this one..
3,Shipping was awful.....,"My overall review of the product was fine it works with my camera, I just had an awful time getting my item. It was sent through USPS and I had to wait 3 days pass the date to receive the item. Tried to contact customer service and let them know my problem and it was no help at all."
1,It does'nt work with my Z650 either,"Maybe I got a bad cable, but mine does not work with my Z650. All I get is a blinking light. The computer does not recognize the camera at all. Which is about my luck."
4,exactly what i needed and ordered,"After finding out what the name of the cable i needed wasi looked it up, found this item, and ordered it. after a prompt arrival and fair pricethe cable is proforming exactly as exspected. no problems since"
5,"Hooks up to the Camera, not the docking station","This cable works great. I just was looking for the cable to connects the computer to the Kodak docking station and this one is NOT it. This cable hooks the computer directly to the camera. But it does its job and transfers the pictures, so no harm."
4,the price is right,This cable is nice to have on the rare occasion that I want to connect my camera directly to the computer. I had to have it at this price.
5,"Easy To Find, Right?","My Easyshare camera, USB cord and computer were beginning to have a hard time transferring pictures into the computer. Not knowing where the problem lay, I decided to start with the least expensive part of that trio - the USB cord. I went to at least 3 stores, bought a USB cord from one, wrong size (who knew?), tried two more stores, nothing in the right size. Of course, I found exactly what I needed at Amazon, and it arrived in good time. It also works perfectly. Very happy customer!"
5,Kodak USB Cable Model U-8,I needed a replacement USB cord for my Kodak Easyshare C713 camera. This one worked great! No problems.
1,Does NOT charge,"This cord does NOT charge the camera as stated that it would for my Easy Share M341. I read on page it was for charging and uploading pictures, not the case at all."
2,doesn't fit my camera,"my camera is on the list but it doesn't work for it. its the wrong shape all together, hopefully I find a replacement or my camera is junk"
3,will this fit a CD82,Help! Im looking for a cord for my cd82 and i cant find any besides the expensive one. has anyone tried this?
1,Horrible Product,I have a Mac and PC laptop and this product did not enable me to upload pictures from my Kodak digital camera on either computer. Utter waste of money; I am extremely disappointed.
3,"""Kodak"" USB Cable - How to Fix Plug Difficult to Insert Problem","The price and delivery time are good.The problem for this cable and the C743 camera is that the camera plug housing is so big that the back surface interferes with the jack access door and the bottom surface interferes with the access door latch peg of the camera. If you do not fix the problem it will be difficult to insert the plug, and I suspect the excessive force might not be good for the plug and jack.I used a Dremel tool and bit to remove enough rubber from these two surfaces to allow easy insertion of the plug.I gave the item a decent rating because it is a quality item once that problem is fixed, and the price is low enough that I don't mind having to do this minor correction."
1,Don't buy from them,"Even though i bought this for mad cheap, I didn't not receive it what so ever. DON""T BUY FROM THEM!!!"
1,Do not buy from Enforcity,"I orginally ordered from Buy.com and pawned it over to Enforcity. I ordered on Sept 14th, they said it shipped out on the 16th, and after 10 days not product. I tracked it to someplace in Georgia. I nver got it, and so Enforcity said they would ship me out another one, which they said they did, on Oct 5th, well, it is Oct. 20th and no product. I told them I wnted my money back, and they said they would credit my account. Now, I just gotta see it............. I am through with Buy.com and Enforcity."
1,Not even worth it,"Honestly, just go ahead and spend some money on a real charger because this will work for a while but after a month or so it will die out."
1,Does not work with M863,"This does not work with the M863 camera. Do not believe the top review listing compatible products. This is nothing more than a normal mini usb, not the special connector Kodak uses. Wasted my money."
4,Kodak USB Cable Model U-8,"Great price for the item. I checked other websites this was the best by far, even Kodak couldn't beat the price. And the item arrived in a few days. Very pleased, and would shop Amazon again."
5,Great for transfering photos to someone else's computer,"I purchased the USB cable for use with my Z1285 Kodak. I have the camera base/charger, that works great when I'm home, but wanted something to plug up to other peoples computers if I want to transfer photos to them. This cable works great. When you hook it up to your camera and to a computer, you can transfer photos from the camera, as though it's a disk drive... WOrks great, and was inexpensive...."
1,Not For All Kodak Cameras,"The Kodak U8 USB cable is supposed to work with the Kodak Z812 IS camera. I bought this for my Kodak Z812 IS camera and it didn't work. I requested another cable from the manufacturer and he was very good about shipping out another one. Unfortunately, the second cable didn't work either. My advise is to be careful with this cable. It might work with other cameras, but not the Z812 IS."
4,"Works for me, but not official","I lost the original cable for my EasyShare Z740, so this was a replacement. Despite all the 1-star reviews saying it doesn't work, I decided to buy on Amazon rather than Kodak's website because of the price difference.The cable I got is shaped exactly like my old one - however, it does not have Kodak's logo or the USB logo stamped onto it like the one that originally came with my camera, leading me to believe it's a cheap copy. It DOES work fine for transferring my pictures though, which is all I wanted it for."
5,Was glad to get it for the price I paid,But when I went to use it it did not work because the disk I had to upload for the camera was incompatible with my computer and thwy no longer make the camera. It was a good try.
1,"Doesn't work, even though made for my camera","This is a Kodak U-8 USB Cable, which is what I need to get information from my Kodak EasyShare M1063 to my computer. I lost mine years ago and have been using a Kodack Extenal Battery Charger, but it does not hold a charge for the battery as long as I would like. I mainly wanted to use this to extract photos, so I do not have batteries, phone cards, and cameras laying everywhere. After plugging this into many of the USB Ports in my computer, I was expecting something to happen. My new computer did not recognize anything! This cable was useless. I've been buying Kodak Camera's for years, and am wondering if it's finally time to switch."
5,Very Happy,"I was very happy to find this cable at such low price, it was like 30x more on other sites. My other cable is in storage so I really did not want to spend a lot of money. I should know better, I should always check Amazon first!"
1,"Fast shipping, defective product","PLEASE do not waste your money on this! No matter how good of a deal you THINK you are getting, this product did nothing. I plugged it into my computer and my camera (it did fit the camera) and it did nothing. It would be cheaper just to throw it away than send it back, so it's not in my trash can. On the positive side, I got it within two days from ordering."
1,Terrible Service,"It has been over a month since I ordered this product and I have not yet received it. I know it was only a penny - but my account was charged for $5 shipping as well. I have not received it, nor have I had any information from the seller. Not pleased!"
1,Does not work,This did not work for me. It fits my camera but would not charge the battery!! Now I'm stuck!! I went out purchased a new battery because I thought maybe the battery was defective lo and behold that new battery needed charging also!!
1,Did not fit camera,This USB cable was advertised as fitting a Koday easy share digital camera. It did not fit.
1,does not work,"the plug in fits the camera but does not do anything nothing pops up on my computer saying it recognizes this devices, will be returning soon"
1,Fail!,"Disappointed. Even though the correct model number was advertised, I received the wrong cable, with a different model number, which does not fit. Unfortunately the time and expense of returning will be greater than just starting over. I should have not cheaped out and and just gone to the Kodak site, lesson learned."
2,product didnt work for me,"I don't know if it was this product or my camera but after a short time of use, (about a month), the camera stop charging. So now, I'm left with a camera that does not work and I think I may have to buy another camera, just like the one I have, just so that I can use it as a charger,etc. ( Is that too extreme?)"
2,Bad U-8's,"Sorry to have a negative but I ordered 2 each of these chords to have a spare. I had initially lost my original. Well niether of the new chords worked. Then after much search I found my original and it works. So the problem is definitely the new chords, they don't work. Lucky for me they didn't cost very much. These same chords elsewhere were $20.00 and up each. At Amazon I paid less than $6.00 for the two chords including shipping, so the loss was negligable."
1,Never received the cord,"I ordered this and was excited about finding it at such a low price, but I never received it in the mail and had to call amazon and go through the process of getting my refund."
1,Highway Robbery for a proprietary cable!,"I've used a number of Kodak digital cameras over the years - And at one time, I would recommend them exclusively to my family members, but I am pretty angered by Kodak's use of non-standard USB jacks and then gouging their customers when a replacement is needed.If they used a standard USB to mini-USB cable, I could get it for five to ten bucks.Many of the camera's that need this cable can be purchased refurbished now for about twice the price of the cable! It is insane to pay 1/2 the total price of a piece of equipment just to replace the USB cable to the device.Kodak has lost a long time customer (with purchasing influence over multiple house holds) because of this kind of business practice.I'd have given this cable zero stars if possible."
4,Fast and Cheap,"There are three things we all want from a product or a company - good, fast, and cheap. However, we can only really count on a combination of two. This cable and the company that sold it to me went above and beyond the two. The cable was delivered quickly, was really inexpensive and works very well. I will buy from this company again."
1,Cable did not work for Kodak camera,"I bought this to replace the original camera charging cable for a Kodak M1063 that was damaged. The cable was cheap to purchase and I think around $5 w/ shipping. The cable arrived quickly, but did not function to charge my camera. Because of the price it was not worth the time and energy to request a replacement - as luck had it I found an old MP3 cable laying around that worked with the camera."
1,Didn't work!,Bought this to replace my Kodak Easyshare cable that I misplaced. Cable does nothing when plugged in. At least I didn't waste much money on this piece of crap.
5,Perfect match,"The cable was a perfect match for my Kodak camera. Without the cable I couldn't charge the built-in rechargeable battery.Ironically, I found the original cable I had lost several days later. I'll keep the new one, too."
1,Kodak U-8 USB Cable,"I recently bought this item and it didn't work at all for my kodak camara m340 i sent an email back to the vendor who sold me this .. and still NO ANSWER i guess this is the way people want to do business, no problem they took 3usd but it's not about the money it's about the principles. I didn't even requested my money back i only requested a new item that will fit and make my camera charged.. Which was the main purpose but o well.Not good customer service."
1,Does not work for my M1063,"This cord does not work for my Kodak M1063 camera as stated. It will charge the camera, but it won't allow me to upload my photos from my camera to my computer. I'm really disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Works,"I can use this to charge my camera, but for some reason my computer doesn't recognize my camera as a camera when I use this cord... Not sure what the deal is, but at least I can charge it. Kind of a pain that I have to remove my card to review my media. Would've been nice to get a heads up on this issue before I made my purchase."
1,no glitter,"it's called glitter glue, but there is no glitter. it's really dull. I wish somebody had written a review, so I am writing this."
5,just love them,"if you like glitter, you'll love these;and they come in so many great colors...what I love is how fine the tip is so that you can be as exact as you want and the glitter is so fine the tip is not easily clogged....I have enough glitter to open my own store, so I consider myself a bit of a glitter conisuer, and I love these"
5,"Great, versatile product!","These Ranger stickles can be used in so many different ways: You can squeeze them and leave them as they come straight from the bottle, you can spread them around for a thick or a thin layer, you can even use them as glue to embed gemstones or other small objects. They're lots of fun to play with!"
5,LOTS OF GLITTER!!!! Drys GREAT!!!,"The glitter glue is GREAT!!! There's TONS of glitter in it, I'm not sure why the other reviews that said it didn't have much glitter in it; unless they got an ""bad egg"" out of the bunch. It drys pretty fast and it's easy to apply with the nice pointy tip!! I actually wanted to buy ""firefly"" but bought ""green"" instead on accident. My project was a success regardless though. It seems kind of expensive but I'm not sure because I didn't look at what it may be in stores (such as Michaels or JoAnn's) but with the convenience of it being shipped, you can't really be that picky :)"
3,very subtle light pink,"It doesn't look pink in the bottle but it is very true to its name, a subtle light pink. Not a lot of sparkle in this one. Its not dull, but the light reflecting properties of the glitter in this glue are not as reflective as some of the other colors such as 'crystal'."
3,"Amanda is beautiful, but this movie is not","First, just to make it clear to those thousands and thousands globally who see an R-rated movie starring Amanda Tapping and expect to see more of her than usual, the answer is yes and no. The shots that merited an ""R"" use a body-double who is listed in the credits and is not artfully edited into the scene.Second, expecting an understandable plot about ""black hole"" physics is asking a lot more than a 90-minute made-for-TV (?) can deliver. Still, it moves along as well as can be expected and gives a somewhat different Amanda than appears on Stargate SG-1.Disappointments include the effects, which appear cheap, and the music, which comes off cheaper.All that said, as an AT fan, I'm glad I bought the movie. Adrian Paul comes off well and Malcom McDowell again plays a villian, although not an entirely unsympathetic one.I just wish to see Amanda Tapping in a better film in addition to the oft-discussed Stargate SG-1 feature."
2,This movie will suck you into a void!,"I think that this movie is more suited for the Lifetime Channel because the movie concentrates more on Amanda Tapping's personal love life than it does on the ""black hole"" problem that the characters in the movie face. OK, the movie features two very good-looking characters, played by Tapping and Adrian ""Highlander"" Paul, but ""The Void"" feels more like 90 hours than 90 minutes long. I gave it two stars because it has Malcolm Macdowall, who always plays a great villian. However, you should avoid this movie at all costs."
3,"""The Void"" not devoid of entertainment value","While I originally watched the movie because I enjoy Amanda Tapping on Stargate SG-1, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot is pretty typical: Will anyone ever invent an alternate energy source that doesn't threaten to blow up the earth?Though Adrian Paul isn't overly believable as a nerd, with or without glasses, that doesn't take too much away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. Tapping does a pretty good job of playing her save-the-world-scientist character differently from her Stargate SG-1 Major Carter. The two are fairly believable as a couple. Malcolm McDowell gives a standard performance as Adrian Paul's boss, the guy Tapping suspects is responsible for her father's death.The movie has almost as much violence as one of Adrian Paul's ""Highlander"" movies, and even a little sex, if you like that sort of thing."
3,The Void,"The only reason I bought this movie was because I am a devoted AT fan and was not disappointed with her performance at all. She sucessfully pulls off a seemingly stagnant role without imitating her alter ego Samantha Carter. It was refreshing to see her in a new role.The movie was fairly good but not fantastic. One that you can only see once or twice. Malcolm McDowell was great, as per usual and Adrian Paul was good. Overall, an unbelievable and unrealistic movie but perfect for that sci-fi junkie.The plot outcome was predictable but that didn't stop a little angst seeping through. Not edge-of-your-seat but good enough. Almost cliched but good enough performances make it acceptable. However, partly ignre the blurb on the back because I doesn't quite make sense. Who is Kat Hicks?FYO - In the second sex scene the raunchy parts are actually a body double, not Amanda Tapping, called Miranda Hermanson. Also, for those SG-1 fans, note Dan Shea's name in the credits."
3,Adequate Sci-Fi Disaster Movie,"I was able to finish watching this one without too much difficulty; I think one would have to be a disaster movie fan to watch it all the way through. I am one so I could. If you have the opportunity, watch the streaming version first then decide if you want a copy of your own.It does have some interesting moments and managed to hold my attention reasonably well. If you're a collector you'll want to check this one out and you may even decided to add it to your collection. I'm glad I took the time to watch it."
1,The Void,"I bought this movie for 2 reasons: 1) because it has Amanda Tapping in it, and 2) its Sci-Fi. The cover is as B-grade as the movie unfortunately. The acting was awful, and so much more could have been done with the storyline. The science behind the story was very interesting though. I'm not sorry I bought it, I love Sci-fi whether its good or bad. Bad movies help you appreciate the good ones :)"
1,very disappointed,"I purchased this movie because I really like the actress Amanda Tapping. The movie started out really good, and was very interesting. But then, she decides to do a love scene, a very explicit one. So, in the trash the movie went. Too bad. The premise was very good. Liquorish"
3,There's a Void in the story line,"Adrian Paul has lost it since his first 5 seasons of Highlander. Hard to believe this is the same actor. He needs to find some cool roles where he is the hero who makes next to no mistakes and comes out on top. Season 6 of the Highlander and the crap movies that followed brought him down. I only bought this because of Amanda Tapping. It seems like the Stargate cast, Highlander, Sanctuary, and various others in the Vancouver film making area are hanging out together and producing whatever they can. This movie had potential, but I am disappointed. I really liked Adrian's old Duncan McLeod character and he just needs to find a role like that again. He has the potential to play the James Bond role. He just needs to find better scripts."
5,Read This BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have this book in an actual paperback copy that I got from my grandmother after she read it. I swear I have read this book at least 10 times. Its amazing. This story pulls you in and you can't pull it down. The suspense is palpable. A must read!
4,Vey good,"A friend gave me this bk. & I was pleasantly surprised after seeing the movie years earlier - The movie naturally leaves out a lot.I liked how all these different religions were brought together to fight evil. And Spellman seemed to do a good job in researching these different religious theories. Also, she provides a bibliography at the end, which is a nice touch. I would classify this a romantic horror/thriller.My one big gripe (& why bk. gets 4 stars instead of 5) was reading Maggie & Peter's dialog. It seemed like practically every sentence they would use each other's name. Having to read ""Oh, Maggie"" & ""Oh, Peter"" over & over made me want to scream."
5,If the movie is half as good....,"I have not seen the movie yet, but I can only hope they do the book justice. It was an exciting,interesting plot and wonderful characters."
5,absolutely brilliant,i decided to read this book because i really wanted to see the movie so i decided that i would read the book first but when i had finished the movie was no longer playing in my area and i am not even the slightest bit disappointed i do not feel like i have missed a thing and really even though i haven't seen the movie i would think it to be impossible to bring out the talent of this wonderfully gifted writer on a flat screen i would have given more stars if you had them but there isn't a better read around
4,Great book!,"Spellman obviously did her research before she wrote this book. I enjoyed her well-crafted story permeated with Christian mysticism, Egyptology, black magic, rituals, and more. It took a little determination to get started, though. The first couple of chapters had me thinking it was going to be a ""chick book."" After I warmed to the story, though, it was tough to put down."
2,Horrible book!,"We read this book in our book club and I was not impressed. This was like a bad movie on Lifetime. The female characters overanalyzed every little event. This was supposed to be a strong woman-hear-me-roar book? What a joke! As a woman, I'm scared to death someone might read this and think this is representative of my gender.On a more literary note, there was too much material to digest. She explored Christianity, Catholicism, Egyptology, Judaism, Buddhism, Satanism, Druids, Taoism, etc, in relation to the story. Also there was involvement from the FBI, NYPD, Mossad, Egyptian army, Media, I mean the list goes on and on. As a reader I initially enjoyed the occult factoids, then it became ridiculous and annoying. I literally laughed out loud when she would introduce another player, organization, or religion. Definitely not recommended."
2,"fascinating concept, but so poorly executed!","I bought this book in a charity shop after seeing the trailer of the corresponding film.I'm not sure if it's just the edition that I've got, but I found that my enjoyment of the (admittedly trashy) plot was severely hampered by the abominable spelling, grammar, punctuation and typesetting.If you do buy this book, avoid the 1993 UK Orion edition."
4,...some advice for the backplate during installation,"This is a very, very good cooler. I run ~15 degrees celsius cooler, under load, versus the stock AMD hsf combo.Measure the dimensions of the area in your case above and to the sides of your CPU. This thing is HUGE. In a full desktop case, I could only install this after completely disassembling the machine, and then cramming everything back together by flexing the motherboard and the heatpipes more than I should have.Not only is the setup wide, it's very tall. My case cover barely slides over the top of the fan.During installation, follow all of the packagted instructions, except for the step that tells you to remove the backing from the motherboard side of the retaining bracket. If you don't expose the sticky side of the pad, you'll be able to reuse this heatsink."
5,Spare backplates available!,"To answer the review on 10/19/05 (with later update on 6/8/06): the Big Typhoon's backplates (i.e. the spare H-clip kits) are available at thermaltakeshop . com . Just go to the Accessories section and there you should find it. So far that is the only place I've found to get the spare parts, but hopefully Amazon will read this review and consider to carry them themselves."
2,Not so good.,The deal was average but when I got the heatpipe I couldn't install the fan because the fan wasn't built for my motherboard. There was a lack of information about the product. So I now have an expensive heatsink laying on my desktop cause I can't use it even when the description said it was for my motherboard too.
1,"dirty, broken, terrible customer service","Unit came in with dirty scanner glass, and scanned with off color along one side. Shortly after install, unit failed to work. New drivers didn't help, nor did their customer service: no phone calls, only email, and no response after two weeks! Fortunately I was able to send the unit back and get a refund. Buy HP, not Microtek!!!"
1,Disappointed! Out of focus slides and PAINFULLY slow scan times!,"I recently purchased the ScanMaker i800 to scan about 1,000 family slides from the 60s and 70s. I thought I could tackle the task at hand easily by scanning 12 slides at a time. Well, just about every slide I scanned comes out extremely soft and way out of focus.I'm not sure if it's a driver thing or what but the scans came out a little better on a PC than they do on my Mac G4 running OS X 10.4. Each slide required extensive sharpening--to the point where they all look over sharpened. Prescans looked acceptable, but final scans looked horrible. I also tried to scan a few prints, but they look pretty rough as well.I've spent countless hours adjusting the settings in hopes to find a combination that worked well for me, but I just couldn't seem to get it right. This is my first scanner and I'm very disappointed. The product looks well built and all the software seems to function well, just not on my Mac :-("
1,Vista? Do not buy this scanner,"I have had this scanner since March of 2007. But, I cannot use it because Microtek does not have a driver for Vista and the scanner does not work.Do not buy this scanner.The company's support is abysmal; it is non-existent. They have done absolutely nothing to get the scanner working despite calls and provide no information. The date that the drivers were to be ready has come and gone.An expensive doorstop."
1,Slow as MOLASSES!!!!,"I bought this scanner to use for high-volume scanning for a professional video project. This scanner is so slow that the person I hired to do the work BOUGHT A DIFFERENT SCANNER AT HIS OWN EXPENSE TO AVOID USING THIS ONE!!!! EVERY time you start a scan this machine recalibrates itself and that alone takes about 90 seconds. This is true EVEN if you are scanning a series of images that are all the same size, format, type, etc. The scan tech said that he can do 4-5 scans on the EPSON he bought in the same time it takes this one to do ONE! And...over the course of a day of scanning the recalibration, BY ITSELF, adds about an hour to the scanning time. I'd sell my soul to be able to return this thing.When I asked about ways to speed up operation or avoid the recalibration, this is the entire message I got back from Microtek tech support:""Unfortunately, this is the way the scanner scans. There is nothing we can do to improve scan time.""'Nuff said."
1,-1 star,"The absolute worst online purchase I have ever made. The software included was not the software advertised or included with the manual, and after a month of contacting their support team (e-mail only, no phone number to talk to a real person) I returned the product. I was unable to make the first scan with their software. Needless to say I wasted many man hours and will never purchase another Microtek product in the future."
3,"Novelty book worth some laughs, but little in depth substance","Bought this book as a gift for my aunt and uncle. Wasn't expected a complete history of boating and drinking, but the book was a bit shorter than expected. There were a few laughs out of it through the first reading, but my guess is that it was never looked at again."
5,excellent book that captures the look and feel of Beatlemania in 1967,"This book is excellent because it captures the look and feel of that era. It is not just a history, although it is. It is not a biography, although it is. This book is part of that era when we were not sure what was going to happen next in society, but we were excited about it. The Beatles helped define that era and they were swept up in it as well. This book is an excellent snap shot of a moment in time when the world could have gone in many different directions. You seem to feel that reading the book. Great book, nice contribution."
5,Mystical Magical Tour,"Paul Saltzman shares what led him to go to India and how he came to meet the Beatles in Rishikesh. The photographs are amazing and Paul's narrative takes the reader along on truly a mystical, magical, tour. I'm delighted to add this book to my library."
2,"Starts good, then collapses","The first book of this series (First Flight) was pretty good. This one started out okay, though a bit dry. However, 200 pages in, it fell apart and I couldn't figure out what was going on. I couldn't finish it."
3,not terribly exciting,Pretty general. Not exciting. Don't think I would watch it more than once. Most of the TV series focused more on particular types of aircraft or a particular theater.
1,Delicate,"These sandals broke within one week of wearing them. The material used is too thin and ripped out of the sole after just a few days out in them. Try another Volcom sandal, not this one."
1,"A Joke of a ""Documentary""","This was nothing but a camera crew talking to a person who was a ""distant"" relative of George W. Bush. The rest of the film consisted of them following this guy around and talking to people who also knew nothing first hand about George W. Bush. Not really sure what this ""film"" is suppose to be about or what information is was trying to convey??"
5,Bush Familt Fortunes- The Best Democracy Money Can Buy,Told the truth and really will shoch the people of the United States. It should me put on National TV during prime time.
1,Typical Liberal Spin!,"This film is nothing more than cool-aid drinking, liberal propaganda! Don't waste your money, or time on this biased, so-called documentary!"
3,based loosely on facts,I have to admit this is a little over the top. However. that said it still contains important facts that americans should be made aware of. some what of an inside look at the ugly side of our reality with bush
2,Nothing i allready didn't know,This is a very uninforming movie. I'm usually a fan of a good propaganda movie but this is just bad. There is no relevent information here they simply tell you ideas that you most likely allready had in your head without confirming them with hard evidence. If you want to watch an actually worth while journalistic film about the bush ties then get Martial Law 911 : rise of the police state. NOw that is one brilliant peice of work
1,So not worth it,This documentry played out like it was done on a very limited budget by amatuers. Editing and flow of movie was horrible.Learned NOTHING new or interesting that i did not already know about the hypocrisy or shady dealings that has long been the Bush family.Total waste of time and money.
4,Very informative,"Despite occasional loss of left speaker sound, this video is very informative and gives us a clear indication into manipulation of our politics. I found out information that I'd never known. Definitely would recommend this for all to see. I would have given a 5 star rating if not for the loss of speaker sound at the beginning and towards the end. I would venture to say that maybe the actual DVD is of better quality. I have sent feedback to the Video streaming Team to try and correct and they are good about following up with Prime Members concerns and issue with videos."
4,Definitely worth seeing and thinking about,"Greg Palast makes the case stronger than I've ever seen it made: the Bushes may well have ""stolen"" the election of 2000. This is the most important piece of the film, I think. Palast actually shows how the felons list was systematically wrong; and it looks like it was intentional. Palast is a BBC investigative journalist, and he strikes me as a good one. The interview of Palast on this DVD shows him making the case very clearly for a ""paper trail"" to go along with electronic voting. While this movie isn't perfect, it's definitely worth seeing and thinking about seriously."
1,Good intentions are not enough,"Although I have political sympathies very close to the creators of this film, I found the film to be amateurish, insubstantial, melodramatic and over-blown. The BBC correspondent that is followed by the camera, Greg Palast, gives the impression of being over his head. We watch him wander from place to place while he spouts his shock and contempt, but it's all very unconvincing. He's not very articulate, apparently had a research budget of about $22.00, and doesn't seem very knowledgeable (at least by BBC standards). The film is so sophomoric, it almost looks more like a college film project than a product of the BBC.If you really want to know how Bush got to be President, buy a good book. This film is a waste of time and money."
1,the stamp of the King's seal,I think the recent firing of folks at CBS:--The departure (under a dark cloud) of Dan Rather.--Walter Cronkite's summation of Rather's failures and Cronkite's own admitted astonishment that CBS allowed Rather to drive the CBS ship into the rocks.--The total discrediting of the National Guard story via...CBS's Memo-Gate.--The choice of the American people in the '04 election and the recent success of the Elections in Afghanistan and Iraq pretty well drive a nail in the coffin of this work that in my opinion is nothing more than Leftist Propaganda.Just classic Bush Bashing from the Lunatic Fringe sector of American Liberalism.Worse yet it is endorsed by Michael Moore....the stamp of the King's seal for whacko leftist running from the Black Choppers in the haunted delusionary fields of their own minds.For those who actually put some value in facts and resent fiction being presented as such Moore's endorsement makes it clear what Bin this DVD belongs in.
1,Makes Michael Moore look like a moderate,This is a classic example of what liberals resort to ever since becoming unable to win at the ballot box.
5,Every American should watch this.,This is the true and easily found story of the Bush family history of looting this country. You won't get it from the mainstream corporate owned media even though the information is right there for them to pick up.
2,A Doc about Bush and not exactly his family,"I found this documentary left out some information about the Bush family that I thought would be included. The documentary did not cover George W. Bush's grandfather's working relationship with the Nazi party during the second world war. Nor did the doc spend much time on the rest of George's relatives and family members. The doc didn't include as much information as I thought that it would and the material that it covered has already been covered in other documentaries like Fahrenheit 9/11. The host of the documentary had to assert his fedora for no reason which was more distracting and annoying to see in what I expected to be a hard hitting, serious documentary."
2,What was the point?,"I must have missed the point of this one. Didn't do much for me. Felt more like the opening trailer for a longer series that never-was? Skip it and move along theNinja Scroll,Wrath of the Ninja,Samurai - Hunt for the Sword, orPuppet Princess"
4,Great soap,"I used this soap for the first time this morning. I wanted a soap that would do it all bath, shave head and face, for lengthily motorcycle something in a small package, I found it Granpa's Pine Tar Soap. This soap does everything it says it does. I'm more than satisfied. I have Eczema and have to be careful what I use on my face this soap is great. I got a close shave with very little razor drag (could be my blade was two weeks old). The smell not great so I don't smell the bar."
5,I love this stuff for excema and sensitive skin,"I have excema that is only help by using a tanning bed. this soap is so wonderful in that it does not aggervate or irritate my skin at all. its kinda got a tire smell, but once you use and it and feel how good your skin feels, and how squeeky clean your skin is yet without any dryess, you will hopefully learn to LOVE the smell like I did. Now i think it smells good. I use this on my kids too occasionally, and it rinses off IMMEDIATELY with no residue. I want my grandma to try to too, its very good stuff. I have tried everything, baby soap, etc, and nothing works like this. I even use it on my face and I invest alot of money into my face w/ products"
1,Really awful smell,I don't know if this soap is good for anything because I only used it twice. I couldn't take the smell and I threw it away.
2,Do you want to smell like tar?,"Cleans well, but leaves you and the surrounding area smelling like you just sealed your driveway. My fault as it says that in the name."
1,Pine Tar Soap,"I got this soap because I was hoping it would help with my itchy skin, but I could only use it once because it smelled like burnt plastic and although it lathered white it left a brown film on my skin. I was very unhappy with this soap. It doesn't smell like a pine tree or like pine tar at all. If you can stomach the scent it seemed like a nice soap, but I just couldn't handle the scent it was just too much."
5,The best thing I did for my skin,"My skin was always very dry, with no pimples or visible pores, and in my mid-thirties I started getting huge painful acne and clogged pores all over my face! I have no clue why it started and I can say that I tried pretty much everything and anything (except the prescription drugs) to get rid of it. Thousands of dollars left in spas for various treatments, spent on products,vitamins, cleansing inside and out ""healthy"" products-you name it! The worst part was that nothing worked.The price of my miracle is only $4.00! Now I only use sunscreen, and some transparent powder when I go out. Nothing else and my skin was never as smooth and beautiful as it is now. I couldn't be happier. This soap is the best and I wish I've found it earlier!"
4,Drying but a clean wash - cept for the dark residue,I smell like a BBQ... or fireplace! I actually love it. It's super drying on my skin though. Even worse on my face. I feel clean though.
3,"Great for hair and skin, scent is controversial.","This soap was recommended to me for the dreaded dry winter skin. Let me say it does that job VERY well in addition to healing up rashes and other blemishes. Unfortunately the smell is very ""manly"" and not something I want on my skin."
3,"A collection of client reports: a Handbook (simplified), but not a Textbook","If you are a professional working on ABS and you want to have a handy collection of the client reports that were distributed by Salomon Smith Barney (now Citigroup), well this book might be very useful for you. The book covers a large breadth of topics and generally they are written quite well. But putting together 700 pages of reports written by different authors doesn't make it an organized book. Most of the chapters are neither a logical consequence of the previous one nor self contained, and they require you to be already familiar with the terminology. Furthermore, this book lacks examples of implementation details, and the mathematics involved doesn't go beyond the very basic. For example, you won't get much detail on how to structure a CMO or how to calibrate a prepayment model.If you don't already know ABS and want to learn the details of securitization I advise you to consider the book of Stone and Zissu."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Lakhbir Hayre has created a comprehensive and authoritative reference guide for the asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities markets. In compiling this book, Hayre drew on the expertise of ABS and MBS specialists from Salomon Smith Barney, which was a pioneer in the development of these markets and still trades the largest volume of the securities. This huge volume includes plenty of charts, graphs and illustrations as companions to its enormously detailed and clearly explained descriptions and analysis. We [...] recommend this book as a useful reference for experts and an enlightening introduction for securitization novices."
5,Filled in the gaps,"This helped me understand how this works, with some of the jargon and some of the standard models that are used in valuation."
4,almost...,"It works as advertised, and is a nice watch,... but despite the fact that it says LADIES, it is LARGE!!! The face is an inch and a half in diameter and heavy. The band is also very large, and has to be taken to a jeweler to adjust (NOT the usual pop out the pin adjustments)."
2,Nice clock during the daytime,"I purchased this clock and have had some problems with it. The first one I received I pushed the button in to set the time and the button became stuck. I was never able to try it, so after sending it back and receiving another clock I did not have any trouble with the buttons. But soon learned the display does not have a light. So it is a great clock during daylight hours but at night the display is dark. So if you want to see what time it is during the night hours, keep a flash light by it! I will be returning it again for that reason. I was disappointed. Other than those reason the clock was clear and was useful with all of it's information on the display."
1,No Reception,"We get no radio control signal with this clock anywhere in our home. Get the Equity 86709 SkyScan Atomic Wall Clock instead. We have several of them, and all receive the signal just fine."
2,No Reception,"This is a beautiful, high-tech looking clock with all of the information I want. The jumbo display in nice so I can read it from accross my office. The only problem I had was the clock wouldn't receive the radio controlled time. I tried at the office and at home, both inside and outside, but nothing. I live in suburban Detroit, and I have no problems with radio reception whether AM or FM. This clock was close to want I wanted, but without the atomic time feature, I'm returning it and continuing to search."
3,This is overrated,"Please know I'm a science teacher. This kit is fun, but most of the activities can be found online by simply typing in fun kid science projects. The rock candy solution didn't work at all and had to find a better ratio online.....btw a 3:1 sugar:water ratio works much better and you'll have some decent to taking over crystals in 1-2 days. Some of the other projects are simply making cupcakes and cookies and talking about the difference between baking soda and baking powder. This can be found online as well. My advice....it's fun, but save some cash and put a good search engine to use."
3,its fun...but work,I got this for my 8(almost 9)yr old for christmas... it was on her list. It is fun but be preapared to do a lot of the work. Children can't do this with just supervision.
3,just okay,What was really upsetting was that the litmus paper doesn't work. It's probably old. Now I have to get some fast locally because I have 2 curious girls that want to see what's going on. So we couldn't do the first 2 experiments.I also would have wished for some explanations about the chemical reactions.My girls (almost 5 and 7) are asking every day to do something with this set. At least it made them curious about chemistry. There are not many experiments in here but I was inspired to just find some on my own.If your kids are as young as mine you will have to help them a lot. But in my case that is part of the fun.
4,As long as you do it,"This isn't really a gift for someone who doesn't want to sit and do the experiments with their child. It does make them think a bit, and my daughter had fun."
4,Good fun with a little help!,My 8 year old son got this for christmas and we had a lot of fun with it! It definitely requires some adult supervision especially for the baking and the rock candy. My son had the most fun making the fizzy drinks and learning how to make soda. Although the recipe for the soda doesn't taste that great it was a lot of fun to make and he did learn all about acids and bases. The other great part of this was that these recipes are easy to recreate even if you run out of the supplies that come with the kit. The big test tubes were also fun.
2,not worth the money,"I bought this to use with my 7 year old son, and I had high hopes for this item based on other reviews and the price, however:-The litmus paper for acid/base experiment do not work-The recipe for the ""soda"" is not drinkable, in the least-Powders for rock candy were supposed to be colored, but were not-Materials are flimsy-The booklet is merely instructions, no teaching of the ""science"" involved.I haven't finished trying the other experiments and I am not sure I will.You could look these ""experiments"" up yourself and do a much better job of rounding up the materials and educational information, with less stress and better results."
2,science kit,"This kit is not what I thought it was going to be. The plastic petry dishes broke almost right away because they were made out of such thin cheap plastic. The plastic tubes do not seal very well, therefore liquid leaks from them. And most the experiments are not tasty, but actually very yucky. I purchased this for my 10 yr old daughter and she required lots of help to complete the experiements."
3,"Tasty Science, Not so tasty","Scientific Explore has great kits and usually if you follow the direction you would come away with great results, however this one did not turn out so great. The cookie dough was not consistant. We had a long time getting it to stick together and the dough just kept coming apart we had to improvise a little. The finished product tasted ok. The cupcakes work out well. They don't keep very long. You have to eat them right away otherwise,they'll spoil. The rock crystal candy never harden. I don't like to give such a bad review, because I like all Scientific Explore's products. Maybe someone else will have better success with this product."
3,Fun but not very tasty,"I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas. We were very excited to get it out of the box and try it out. Our first project was the soda, it was simple enough to make, but the taste was horrible, even though we followed instructions and added more flavoring for taste. The cupcakes and cookies had the same result.The instruction booklet it comes with does hold some educational value, and if you do all the steps in order, it can be a fun learning process. Just don't expect your child to be willing to eat the projects!"
4,Excellent Choice,I bought this and had it shipped to my Godson for his birthday as he loves to experiment with anything and everything and also loves to help in the kitchen. He ABSOLUTELY loves it!!!! He was so excited and has called me several times to tell me what he has done with it today! Awesome gift for such a reasonable price.
1,wastey science,"Please don't waste your money on this product. It's beyond ironic that the word ""tasty"" is in the title, the stuff is not even edible. Most of the experiments use home ingredients, the kit has 4 test tubes and a couple of packets of ""ingredients"" and 3 horrible ""flavors"". The suggested experiments aren't worth the mess they make and the dishes you have to do afterwards. The only thing my 6 year old learned is that sugar tastes pretty good as long as you dont add their flavoring."
1,First science experiment -- fail.,"The first experiment listed in the booklet is an acid/base experiment involving common household liquids -- baking soda in water, vinegar, etc. The kit comes with red litmus paper, which turns blue if the liquid is basic, but does NOT come with blue litmus paper, which would turn red if the liquid is acid. Haven't tried the other experiments yet, but experiment #1 is a FAIL."
2,fun? maybe. tasty? not so much.,"my daughter received this as a gift. the ""cupcakes"" (i use that term very loosely) were absolutely vile! blech! the only reason it got any stars from me is that she had fun making the flavored sugar candy powder. i think you'd probably be better off buying the ingredients yourself and making actually edible creations."
2,Wouldn't buy again.,"This toy is good in theory but the experiments require a lot of ingredients from your home. The few experiments that we did try didn't work well. Nice idea, poorly designed."
2,"Should be called ""horrible-tasting science""","The title of this review is courtesy of my 7-year-old son (and I don't disagree). We had experiences similar to those of other commenters, as follows:1) the litmus paper didn't work.2) the fizzing soda tasted horrible.In addition, we also noticed the instructions had errors (I don't think they were written by someone with a good grasp of English). Following the instructions for the fizzy drink led to much overflowing from the test tubes. Also, as one reviewer pointed out, there's little to no discussion of the science behind the experiements."
2,Not Tasty and Not Science,"My 7yo little girl got this from us for Christmas. She'd been asking for it for a while. My husband has done most of the activities with her, but while she likes them, we're not fans. There's not a lot of experimenting to be done. Nor do they really give you any reasons why you're doing the activities. The rock candy didn't work. The cupcakes and the soda tasted awful. Based on buying this kit, we wouldn't buy any of the other Scientific Explorer kits at all."
2,Please save your time and money,"Cool gift in theory, but the fun factor ends there.I give the manufacture and ""F"" on this for quality assurance and instructional material. Kind of hard to teach your kid how to follow instruction when the results are this bad."
2,Disappointing,The experiments do not work as described. We followed all the instructions and it never worked.Nothing tasted as described. It was just a disappointment.
2,Not so good,"Bought this for my son for Christmas because he loves to help us cook and make his own ""projects"" in the kitchen. The instructions are so hard to follow they can hardly keep dad interested let alone a young child. They don't explain anything, the kitchen test needs to explain in a fun way what acidic and basic are in the first place. The rock candy didn't even work, not to mention that it takes 4 days+ to make. I will not buy their other science kits."
2,Not for those interested in science,"This kit wasn't what I had hoped it would be. Maybe we got a bad batch of materials, but the litmus paper and the rock candy experiment didn't work. But even if they had worked, there is little or no science involved. There are no descriptions in the instructions that teach about the reactions or chemical processes that are taking place. Other reviews have mentioned that it was a lot of fun for their kids and it is on some levels, but my daughter (age 7) is intensely interested in conducting experiments and understanding why things work. If your child is similar, buy something else!"
2,What a let down!,"I ADORE all things Aventura, own every song they've made. So of course I asked for this cd when I knew it was about to drop... the LIVE killed me. You can barely hear the music, it's like I'm sitting at a concert - but kinda far away. On the stereo at home it fills the house with so much noise that I end up turning it off. I assumed with 2 cds and a dvd one would be live and the other studio, but nope. All screaming crowds. I even searched to see if it came in a NON-Live version. I'm disappointed, but love them anyway, just don't recommend this CD."
1,It was missing the 3rd CD,"THe 3 CD set is a lie! I only received teh 2 CD sets and where the 3rd CD/DVD was supposed to be, was EMPTY!!!!"
4,Recording quality could have been better,"The new songs are great. However, some of the Live recordings could have used better live sound work. It's apparent that they simply wanted to take performances from different Latin American countries, not based on sound quality. They should have recorded at an concert set up specifically for this album. In one performance you can even hear audio feedback (loud ringing)!"
4,YOOOOOOOOOO,K.O.B is good and its evident that their taking their style of bachata further and adding new twists with their new tracks.i would say is like an intermediate album. Aventura is just breathing in and out all the success theyve had since they started and define themselves once again. All their albums have been great and K.O.B just sums all theyve done and a taste of what they got next.
1,BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!,"The Spode Christmas Tree creamer is a lovely item. However, don't let the good price fool you. I ordered this item on 12/13/04 to be sent to NY as a Christmas gift. Guess what? The item was shipped to me instead on 12/17/04. Spoke with customer service on 12/18/04 and assured that a replacement item would be shipped on 12/27/04 to NY (after Christmas) in addition to sending a return shipping label to me. Guess again? Now, it is 1/3/05 and customer service says the replacement order was cancelled with no notification to me. Another replacement order can now be arranged for a NY receipt in about 2 weeks. I am bypassing amazon.com and replacements.com to ship the package still in my house directly to NY on my own. It is simply not worth all the time and trouble dealing with all this inefficiency and embarassment."
1,Worst book ever,"You will like this book if you are a believer in moral relativism - it's okay to do bad things to arrogant, incompetent, foolish people who deserve it. I almost couldn't finish the book for being beaten over the head repeatedly with this message. I found the other books in the series mildly interesting, but overwhelmingly repetetive (war is bad, messy, dirty, soul-killing, repeated several times each chapter). This book did nothing to advance the character development of the Revely siblings or the mystery of the Peacemaker's identity. The episodes of Joseph as gunner shooting at the Red Baron and going through the German lines to retrieve a deserter were so ludicrous and ill-written as to be comical. The whole book was merely a thinly-veiled vehicle for Anne Perry to get out her message that you can do anything you want as long as you have good intentions. I don't plan to finish the series. This book completely killed any interest I had in the story."
2,Disappointing entry in series,"I have enjoyed the three previous novels in this series set during World War I, this novel, however, was tedious to the point of boredom. No character is thin without being gaunt. No decision is met head on, rather each character is treated like a potential Hamlet, full of indecision and totally overwrought. Miss Perry's editor obviously gave up and surrendered her blue pencil leaving the author to blather on and on and on. I will get the abridged version of the next title."
5,Anne Perry's books,I have been reading Anne Perry's books ever since her first one came out and have never been disappointed. This war series has been very good also.
3,Moving at a Snail's pace,"This book is really tedious. There is more description than action and a few of the plot devices seem way too contrived. The bit with Joseph in the airplane just didn't seem realistic too me. Also the longer this series goes on, the more I detest Josephy, the chaplin. While he is indeed the main character in this 5 book series, he becomes more loathsome and sententious with each book. I really dislike him and find his brother Matthew a far more interesting character and it is too bad that Anne Perry decided to focus on Joseph."
5,Helpful Reading,When you enjoy reading as much as I do it is so rewarding to be able to continue toread my particular authors regardless of my inability to see printed pages.
5,a must have,the title says it all. i have used this set for 4 years now and have not had a problem with them. if they ever break or if i round them off they are easily replaced with the lifetime warranty. i recommend this set to anyone in any field
2,Not what I had hoped,"I was really disappointed with this video. The low production quality really shows. Much of it looks like it was filmed with a cheap pocket camera. Lots of bad edits. Lot's of history on Texas, cattle and ranches but most of it doesn't correlate with the historical or modern cowpuncher and how he was shaped. Very little time was actually spent showing cowpunchers doing their work. Also, Waddie Mitchell, Queen of the Buckaroos, really shouldn't have been included is this video. It seems he was included purely to make snide comments about the cowpuncher way of doing things. I haven't seen any of the other videos in the series and after watching this, probably won't."
4,Texicans - A Must Read,Reading the Texicans gave me a glimpse into an era of Texas history that I had never visited. I thoroughly enjoyed this historical novel and read with excitement and anticipation to what was next for the Stockman family. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys historical periods in Texas history.
3,Excellent characterizations but more like a short story,"Irini Spanidou is clearly a great writer with a defined style and a particular talent for conveying the personalities and emotions of her characters. While there is not much of a plot in the literal sense of the word (the book is on the short side, with very few ""events""), Spanidou is able to bring her characters to life using minimal descriptions, dialogue, etc. If you are looking for a good ""story,"" this won't float your boat. However, if you are more interested in exploring the psychology and emotions of people, in a setting other than the U.S., this might be just right."
4,"Said it was new, but it wasn't","When I purchased this book it said, ""new"" in the description, but the book I received was not new. The corners were bent and it had dings all over it. Since it's a hardcover book I am not too upset, plus I paid only a dollar for the book, so all it all not a bad deal. The book itself is amazing. I highly recommend it."
1,It arrived broken,"I waited so much to get this base given I bought the UPPA Baby Vista stroller for my baby that when I got it and it was broken I was beyond frustrated. I did not get a chance to try because I sent it right back and asked for the refund. I did not want to go through the same process again. I think that baby items in particular, although it should aply to all items in general, should have a high standard of control over their products. I just imagine if I had placed the baby on that base and it came crumbling down."
1,BAD VENDOR WARNING,"I ordered a ""new"" swimsuit from this vendor. When it arrived, the packaging was torn and open, and the tags were loose. Yuck. I contacted the vendor to request help returning it and they refused. If you go through their feedback (wish I had done so before I bought!), you will see other stories like mine."
5,Perfect Swim Suit,I checked many shopping sites including the TV shopping and this was the best price of all. The swim suit was brand new with tags still on. The seller specified that the sale is final so make sure that you order the correct size before ordering. (I agree with their policy) I'm glad that I checked Amazon.
1,What a bummer,"I've got all IAN MOORE releases and loved everything he has done until this offering. MODERNDAY FOLKLORE and ALL THE COLORS were excellent and intelligent changes in direction, while still maintaining the obvious skills and energy from his BLUES persona. This is like EMO dross.....LEONARD COHEN without the humor. There is not even a tiny bit of energy to be found anywhere on this disc. If IAN still plays the guitar, it sure is not obvious to this listener. Not sure which drug you'd need to take to make this dirge sound good. Crying shame for one so obviously talented as IAN MOORE. I am also still listening to find the INTELLIGENT bit that some reviewers are referring to. PRETENTIOUS - YES - WANKING - YES - FLACID - YES - INTELLIGENT - NO !!!"
1,"Not warm, but dull","I am a big fan of the D'addario phosphor bronze round wound strings, but wanted a slightly warmer sound. Thw flat tops just seemed dull sounding to me. After about a week I dumped them."
1,jerrybnc,The strings sound ok but I was looking for some that would be more like the ones on my electric.These strings made my fingers sore. I won't buy them again.
4,"No squeak, kind of tinny.","I bought these strings to get rid of the squeak that occurs when you run your hand up the neck as you're fretting the guitar. That part worked wonderfully. If there are any squeaks at all, they are very minor. However, the strings don't have as much of a full sound as my previous strings, kind of tinny sounding. I bought the light versions and I still think they are pretty heavy. Don't know if they have an extra light version, but if they do, I would try those instead. Overall, pretty happy."
3,Not For Fingerpickers,"Not quite as bright as new strings usually are, but definitely warm sounding. Less string squeak is nice. The thing I couldn't get over, unfortunately, was the weird feeling of the bass strings to my right thumb. I usually don't use picks. As smooth as these strings are to go up and down the fretboard with my left hand, the right hand just didn't like them at all- the bass strings seemed to have some weird styrofoamy feeling friction against my thumb and it sorta slows my right hand down, throwing me off my attack, and just feels icky. For slide playing, they are quite nice. And if you use fingerpicks or flatpicks, they should be just fine."
1,The worst fictional comedy I've ever read.,I wish I could give this a zero or negative stars.This sounds so fabricated and made up it's hard to get through without laughing. It sounds like this wee guy's ego has got a firm grip on him. His sense of self worth and fake toughness is laughable. I have a real hard time believiving that law enforcement is terrified of a 5'7'' 150 pound guy. Ha. What a joke. His stories of his encounters with law enforcement are hillarious. This book should be labeled as pure fiction. I'd bet any similar weight varsity high school wrestler would pummel this guy in under a minute.It's ashame he didn't spend his time incarcerated more wisely and get himself some sort of education so he wouldn't sound so ignorant. No one believes these idiotic stories from a Napoloen like twerp. It's ashame this b.s. was ever written.
1,Just dont do it,"If you don't like the book John Shea will probably come to your house, and beat you up. He spends the entire book explaining how tough he is. Repeat: do not even think to look at John Shea funny. Just a horrible read."
1,Keep you damm code.,"I am Irish - true. Truth something I found hard to find in this book. About 4 pages in I knew I did not like John Shea. I did not like his big head, his self prommition and his lack of any remorse. I might just say to John Shea if I ever meet him ""It takes a real man to admit when he has bone wrong"". My advice don't waste your money on this book I am sorry I did. If you want to read about Southie Read Michael Patrick McDonald, Howie Carr read anyone expect this idiot."
3,"Good story, written by a guy WAY too full of himself","Very interesting read about Whitey Bulger and the Irish mafia in South Boston. But Shea comes off as an egomaniac wannabe boxer who considers himself the only honorable criminal in Southie after Bulger is discovered to be an FBI informant. If you liked ""The Departed"" you'll like the book, just be prepared for an author who reminds you OVER AND OVER that he's better than other criminals because he never took a plea bargan."
3,predictable entertainment,"Entertaining insight to the 1970's - 80's Boston irish mob. Authentic story, predictibly leavened by the author's projection of himself as a ""superman""."
1,total waste of time,"I read this book and came away very dissapointed and asking myself what the author was trying to say .He was a drug dealer,He has a complete lack of respect for woman as he himself writes how he is hurting this young Asian girl at the very beginning of his book.The author also states he was running the So.Boston drug operation at 20 yrs. of age having been familiar with this case thruogh family of police invoved he was at best a mid to low level drug dealer who recieved little or no respect on the streets except when he arrived with back up I went into this book with an open mind but came away very dissapointed this was merely an attempt to cash in on other books on the same subject that have a true story to tell"
1,Shame,"Badly written, gratuitous, and completely immoral for its encouraging people to keep quiet. This is no real man. Anyone involved in this project ought to ashamed of themselves. Plus he stole a lot from other people's books about Southie. Or tried too. It's so badly written it doesn't even matter."
1,How did this ordure get published?,"I read this half expecting it to be something like Michael Patrick MacDonald's exquisite ""All Souls."" What a disappointment! As a lifelong Bostonian and former amateur boxer who had a few occasions to interact (marginally) with guys who knew the entire dramatis personae of this book's genre, I would call it a fairy tale. Shea was a second rate amateur boxer and a thug. The book is so self-aggrandizing and insubstantial. And from what I have heard of Whitey Bulger, he did not suffer fools gladly."
1,Who does this guy think he is fooling?,"I have read a lot of True Crime books but never have I read one as poorly written and dumb as this one. This guy is trying to make a killing out of the fact that he committed crimes and then went to jail for them and that makes him a hero? Who is he joking? He's a lousy criminal, he got caught, he went to jail, end of story. I have heard from people far more connected to Whitey Bulger than this low level drug dealer that he was anything but the tough guy in Bulger's mob that he tries to create in this ridiculous book. All he is trying to do is prove he is still a man. After wasting my money on this silly book, I still remain unconvinced. Don't even think of buying this pathetic book."
5,The Most Credible Book out there,"I've been following stories about the Irish Mob for several years now, and I've got to admit that this story is the real deal. All the others are written by either journalists or government/paid informers. Never trust someone that rats on others to save their own skin. They'll say anything to get ahead. And journalists will also say anything to get ahead. Objective journalism died many many years ago.So what are you going to read, rat stories or hack stories? I say none of the above. The only real option is ""Rat Bastards,"" the real story written by one of the few Stand Up still alive. So do yourself a favor and check this book out, otherwise you are a Rat Bastard!"
1,Load of Crap,"I have read Black Mass (great book) and Eddie Mac's book (so so..) so I definitely have an interest in the Irish Mafia. But, this has to be the worst books that I have ever read. If you want to listen to this clown rave about how good of a boxer he was or how much he loved his girlfriend or how he hated rats, then this is a good read for you. But, honestly I dont beleive any of the stories in this book and I think you are better off spending your money somewhere else. This book should be classified as FICTION."
1,A sick joke,"From the first page of this book, I started to get sick, but since I had actually spent money (don't ask me why I bought this book. I must have been crazy but I love anything to do with Whitey Bulger) I decided to finish it. I should not have wasted my time, as well as my money. This guy is not only ridiculous, he's pathetic. Trying to prove his manhood in every line. All he proves is that he got out of prison too soon. The book is poorly written, as dumb as the writer. And I'm feeling just as dumb since I paid good money for this piece of junk. Take my advice and save youself the money. I know too much of the Bulger story to believe this guy had anything to do with Whitey. Whitey was too smart to spend a minute with this jerk. Something is wrong with a big time publisher that would want its name on this lousy book. Shame on you, HarperCollins. This is the last time I'll trust your judgement on a good book."
4,A rat himself indeed,"This is a great book depicting the lower forms of society who chracterize themselfs foolishly with world like honor and being a ""man"". One need not search very far to realize honor is found in the many men and women who prodly serve this country or respond to the countless needs of many americans. Shea is rivoting and indepth about the life he grew into from the streets of south boston. A hero by no standards, Shea is of a species similiar too in knowledge and charachter of a rat he lothes to be. I have read many of the books from similiar low lifes of the south boston lure and find this book to be similiar in content. One can only hope that many of the young adults growing up in S.B. not follow the footsteps of such scum bags who spilled their cess and bile over the streets in the form of drugs and corruption. ENJOY!"
5,Fascinating,"This book is excellent and should be read by all who enjoy an edge. The author shares his fascinating experiences in the projects; the streets; the ring; the narcotics trade; and the criminal justice system. Shea survived some very scary places through a remarkable spirit of aggression and an absence of fear. He describes horror and brutality with cerebral observation and introspective eloquence. He is not a sympathetic figure, but he never asks us for sympathy, perhaps only for a little respect for a guy who grew up hard and paid a hard debt in full."
2,NOT for Beginners,"Although this DVD is marketed to beginners and is included in Gaiam's ""All Day Yoga for Beginners,"" this is NOT a beginner's workout. This 20 minute workout moves quickly from pose to pose, using the Yoga name rather than a descriptivephrase, i.e. ""Begin in mountain pose"" rather than ""begin by standing erect."" forcing the student to constantly refer to the screen.Many of the poses require more balance and flexibility than a beginner possesses and no intermediate or substitute poses are given. Instructor Suzanne Deason's only concession to beginners is the use of a block to lessen the stretch of some of the poses.I would NOT recommend this to a beginner."
4,Useful Short Practice,"This is a good 20-minute all-around practice, useful for squeezing in when you don't have much time for yoga practice. I've got where I prefer it to both the a.m. and p.m. videos in this same series.It includes everything a good yoga practice should: a warm up, standing poses, twists, backbend, forward bends and relaxation. Emphasis on loosening the shoulders, and opening the lungs.Naturally, in trying to include so much in such a short time, there are parts that feel a bit rushed, which is the video's main flaw. However, it's not so fast that I can't keep up. If I have a leisurely morning ahead of me, I will generally choose something else -- but I'm happy to have this for mornings that aren't."
3,20 minutes is not enough to relieve stress,"In my opinion, stress can best be relieved by a good workout, which you won't find in this DVD. As a college student who practices yoga regularly, I have found that an hour of yoga or pilates helps me calm down and focus, and really helps in relieving pain from my back (where a lot of us carry stress). So my suggestion is that even if you have a busy schedule, you need to make room for an hour of full-body workout which will make you break a sweat. Look for yoga dvds that can provide this for you.I guess what I am trying to say is that although the instructor is pretty good, and the dvd is concise and gets straight to the point, I don't agree with the product's claim that it will relieve stress."
2,Good content but packaging was a bit misleading,"The actual yoga practice on this DVD is beneficial but entirely too brief, in my opinion. the actual practice is only 20 minutes. The cover notes say there is a total of 1 hour and 5 minutes of content. The rest is an interview with Susan Deason and a ""how to"" section for using yoga props. This is a very mild practice and using the props is very easy and really doesn't require any extra help. I couldn't care less about an interview with Susan Deason.The ""special edition"" DVD I bought was also supposed to include a 60 minute pilates workout with three 45 minute variations. If those on on this DVD, they didn't include a selection button on the DVD menu. A bit disappointing."
4,Relieved the stress,"This is a very relaxing video, only issue is there is a lot of prop use and no mention that they are needed on the cover.Also kind of quick. Would be better if it had a review of the positions first and slowed down a bit."
2,stress relief?,"This tape does not relieve stress in my opinion. The practice is fast paced and people with previous injuries may re-injure themselves as I did. I was interested in a tape for stress relief, relaxation,and strength to recover from many injuries.I did not find it in this video. I did not feel relaxed or destressed. In fact, I was anxious because the flow was too fast for me and I could not keep up with the instructor. I was pausing the tape frequently to go into poses correctly,and no modifications were instructed. I used the props and did the exercises incorrectly.Definately not a beginners tape. I actually found more instruction and modification in a yoga book.I have developed my own practice with fantastic results."
3,Not for an introduction level student,"Rather than being famous drawings, they are drawings made by artists more famous for their paintings. More for the advanced art lover."
4,"Comprehensive, Excellent for History Lovers","I picked this up for the depression history, which was excellent. It gels a lot of sequential events into a comprehensive, albeit long, history of the era. If you like history, this is the best work I have read, so far, of this era. Kennedy's observations on Roosevelt's statesmenship was tremendously insightful. The remainder of the book on the war was icing on very well baked cake."
3,Very informative. I now have a new understanding of the depression and why it happened.,I am still reading this very detailed account of the time period. I have to stop and process what I am learning.It has been very eye opeing.
4,Excellent,"Well written, well researched. Eerily reflective of our own times. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in history. Reads like fiction."
3,Too Much Narrative,"Here's a review in process: I'm about 1/3-thru this book, and have found it to be almost entirely broad narrative of the Hoover presidency & American population trends. Gets pretty tedious. I'm hoping the author at some point relates individual experiences thru firsthand accounts, specific stories and vivid description of American lives that allow the reader to see, feel, taste what it was really like to live in this time period. Will update this review with hopefully more positive things to say. Nothing sticks in my mind at the moment, which is the problem of narrative writing."
5,Required reading for anyone seeking facts about this era!,"Freedom From Fear is an amazing collection of information regarding the tumultuous time period spanning 1929-1945. Kennedy presents a balanced, pragmatic view of the political and social issues of the day that have often been revised and twisted beyond recognition by others. I especially enjoyed how Kennedy addressed many controversial rumors regarding WWII, including events surrounding the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the race to develop atomic weapons. Some sections regarding monetary policy, the gold standard, etc., were sometimes tedious, but most of the time I could hardly wait to turn the page! I recommend this book to anyone interested in American and world history, but especially to those not old enough to have lived through the Great Depression and WWII."
2,An attempt to rewrite history,"I would have guessed that this book was written by Rush Limbaugh or Ann Colter by its attempt to mislead and rewrite American history. Roosevelt the mental lightweight causes the Great Depression before he becomes president, is responsible for World War II with his weak foreign policy, and blunders through economic recovery with the New Deal. The hero is the misunderstood economic genius Herbert Hoover, whose policies later adopted by Roosevelt ultimately saves our nation. All of this wonderfully supported by the commentaries of Roosevelt's political enemies. This book is laughable and hopefully will not be taken seriously by anyone."
1,Disappointingly narrow,"After reading David Walker Howe's excellent ""What God Has Wrought: The Transformation of America, 18-15-1848"" I begin looking at the other books in the Oxford History of the United States series. I saw David Kennedy's ""Freedom from Fear"" and assumed that it would be as well-written, broad and interesting as Howe's book. Big mistake!In spite of its subtitle ""The American People in Depression and War: 1929-1945"" Kennedy's book is mainly a history of the Roosevelt administration, its policies, and politics and a military history of World War II. As far as a history of the American people, there is very little of the social or cultural history that made Howe's book so interesting.As far as the political and military history of the Roosevelt administration, the writing is tedious, although I really don't find Kennedy to be overly biased one way or another.Overall a disappointment."
2,"Far too negative on Roosevelt and the ""New Deal""","I know it is chic to resite the non-accomplishments of past or current world leaders, but this is too much. For 362 pages we read that Roosevelt did nothing right, that he careened from crisis to crisis, never did anything than had any effect on the economic problems of the times, did nothing for Labor or Farming, attacked Business on every possible occation, destroyed the Military, lied to the American People to win re-election in 1936, tried to destroy the Supreme Court, etc. It is hard to find anything that the author thinks Roosevelt did right!We then read 18 pages on how great and meaningful the results of the New Deal were and how they not only changed the country, but saved democracy as we know it!I can't wait to find out how Roosevelt lost the Second World War. I am sure he did it all by himself!"
3,Is Freedom from Fear All that Good,"I suppose I want to comment on the concept of freedom from fear. I do not think it is possible to be free of fear without first destroying all those whom you fear. Understand that the arms race was preceded by WW II, and we have been arming ourselves since to be free from fear. If all you are concerned about is freedom from fear then you will have very little freedom. Life is risky and is filled with many snares. You can try to remove the hazards but your life will be empty and suffocating if you would eliminate all things that would cause you fear. I hold freedom of fear suspect as it is not in the Bill of Rights. All I can advise is that you live with your fears. Courage is bearing your fears without making a prison for yourself or others."
1,CHECK WITH SELLER TO SEE IF YOU ARE GOING A FULL CD OR A SINGLE,"Note that this Amazon listing is for the cd SINGLE, and not for the whole album. In spite of that, all the reviews and information suggest a full album, as do the prices of the used items. I recommend contacting seller to determine what you are actually going to get. I thought I was ordering the whole album and got only a single."
5,"Deeply touching, beautifully conceived and realized.","Beth Nielsen Chapman is as good as there is among singer songwriters (other than the High Priest and Priestess of singer-songwriters: Paul Simon and Joni Mitchell).Beth Nielsen Chapman writes and sings from the depths of her soul, a soul which has known tragedy in addition to euphoria. Among other perspectives, she manifests in her albums the heart and soul of a woman who loses her love -- her husband, lost to cancer -- and recovers with verve and renewed energy. This alone makes her music worth hearing. Her words and music pour forth as a tonic for the troubled heart.But there is so much more! Amidst the exquisitely lyrical music (and specially beautiful vocal harmonies), and of course the lyrics themselves, her music somehow includes great, catchy refrains! Some of her rhythms remind of Carole King, but this is an artist of depth beyond the 'tin pan alley' of the Brill Building, and the catchy Carole King."
5,"The ""Official"" Album of Grieving","If you are grieving, you need this album. It was written as Beth went through the loss of her husband to cancer. It profoundly traces her experience as she tried to get through to the other side of grief-- as a young widow with a child to try to raise without his father. This album goes bravely to the core of the experience all the way through to hope-- simply and eloquently.This record reflects the profound loss, depth of grief and yet also the sureness that you can come out on the other side--richer, deeper and more loving than you thought possible.Her sweet clear voice is so honest and accessible. Although Sand & Water was released more than 10 years ago, it has a timeless, immediate quality.Everyone grieves differently. Yet the experience of grief is universal. They say grief is divided when shared. Beth's recording shares and divides our universal experiences of grief in a deeply moving and healing way."
5,"A sweet, romantic disk with beautiful ocean metaphors","I heard one track of this CD on a TV show, and ordered the album to listen to the rest. The entire album was a wonderful surprise. The music is a mix of up-beat and soft, romantic tracks; the lyrics rich in meaning and full of images of the sea. Beth's voice is clear and sweet, and the musical arrangements are fresh, without being over-complicated.I have owned this CD for about 4 months now, and it is still my favorite! Today, I'm going to buy another one by this outstanding artist. Keep an eye on Beth Nielsen Chapman - she's going to have an important imapct on the music scene.Mark Jordan"
5,Someday Everyone Will Know Who She Is!,"I've been buying and enjoying Beth Nielson Chapman's music since her first couple of songs became popular in the early 90's. Each new song of hers seems better than the last. It's hard to pick a favorite. Her ""Sand and Water "" CD just took my breath away, and I've played it more than any music I own. Her music and words flow together into something that is so unbelieveably beautiful, sad, and romantic. It seems that every one who hears her music thinks she is someone very gifted and special. I wish she had more CD's out there."
4,"A Solid ""Ma Vlast"" But Not As Powerful As It Could Be","Sir Colin Davis is captured on this recording with the London Symphony Orchestra in a rare performance of Smetana's ""Ma Vlast."" This is a very good reading, but it lacks the punch of Rafael Kubelik's accounts on Deutsche Grammophon with the Boston Symphony Orch. and on Supraphon with the Czech Philharmonic Orch. James Levine, Libor Pesek, Neeme Jarvi, and Charles Mackerras have turned in good performances of ""Ma Vlast"" as well that are worth checking out.The audio quality, however, is excellent. This recording has also been released as a hybrid SACD. I imagine that sound is unbelievable in surround sound.This is a good overall interpretation and performance, but it wouldn't be my first choice for this piece. Sir Colin Davis usually does a fine job, but his true specialty, for me, are his interpretations of Berlioz and Sibelius."
5,Very Interesting,THsi book as a very interesting perspective and I think it is very good. THe tape defiantly helped whith understanding how to follow through with the books ideas.
4,modern fairy tales are the best!,"i love fairy tales of any kind. this is a collection of short stories -fairy tales written from a lesbian point of view. i think the beauty and the beast adaptation was my favorite, oh, and the cinderella one (what a great compromise they all came up with at the end). i really didn't like the one about the woman who knocks her head and goes on to save all these fairy tale women by having sex with them. i hated her tone and her dumb 'being a good butch' blah blah. yuk. you might do better to pick and choose your stories, but it is very good."
3,"FYI -- Book is in Thai, not English","My star rating means nothing, since I can't read the book (but can't opt out of the star system). Except for the preface and title page this book is not in English, as the product details state, but is actually essays in Thai for language learners."
4,DVD/VCR Mounting Bracket,I found the bracket to be perfectly adaptable to the application I needed. It was easy to install and very sturdy.
5,Legends of Jazz,Very cool collection of Jazz greats.Exactly what I was searching for.Provides a taste of some great music.Makes you want more.
2,The not-so-great Central European bestseller,"While the much-praised book does offer a good joke every now and then, the attention it receieved in Central Europe is probably due to the breakup with the ""very very serious... and sad"" stories usually told in the region. Apart from a bizzare portrait of the new riches of Prague, there's not much to be appreciated in the book."
3,Decent,I bought this book because I have absolutely no clue about car repair. My car needed a new radiator and thought this would be a good purchase. The book had just a couple of pages on how to do it and lacks information. I ended up doing it myself.
5,GREAT SELECTION OF COSMIC PSICHEDELIC MUSIC!!!,"This is a very recommendable CD.The first CD starts with very well crafted HAWKWIND's selection, which for reference can be compared to the live recording on Pink Floyd's UMMAGUMMA (i.e., very much cosmic). Then it moves to VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR, which also has its cosmic nature and adds eclecticism to it.The second CD starts with 8 songs from AMON DÜÜL II, very well selected, in which the vocals and guitars are excellent; this may be a little less cosmic, but, for perspective on how good it is, the sound is similar to Peter Hammill's. The last section of the CD are 7 additional great songs from VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR, which show the creation of complex layers and profound vocals by Peter Hammill (himself in this case).Overall quality of the recording is excellent; this is key to notice since there is another CD with the same title that has been reported to have not good sound.All in all, this CD delivers what it offers; enjoy it!Fer"
4,Good New Band - Debut EP,"The Answer is a new band from northern Ireland. Formed in '00 by guitarist Paul Mahon, they are a hard-ish rock band whose roots are obviously set in Led Zeppelin-esque rock.Their tight riffs and and high pitched vocals are very catchy and I would reccomend buying this collection!Paul Mahon - GuitarMicky Walters - BassCormac Neeson - VocalsJames Heatly - Drums"
5,Definite requirement for installers...,"I do alot of car audio installations and this little thing saves alot of time... i can strip ""ALMOST"" any wire in a second... i say almost because it does not support 0/1, 4 and 8 AWG... bigger power lines... but for more common uses for speaker wires and other electronics, this is no doubt my best friend... If you are not able to pick it up on amazon, all local autozones carry this for under 10 bucks... i bought it as a replacement after one of my customers ran over my first one..."
1,Boring!!!,"My daughter has a lot of books, and this one is very boring. It's just dogs barking. I bought it because of all the good reviews on Amazon. Don't believe the hype. This one is not worth the $6."
5,Buyer beware!!,"If you are looking for a cute little book to quietly read to your child look elsewhere. This book demands imagination and volume! My son loves this book when I read it. I bark and howl to my heart content. but when others read it and do not ""do"" the noises and just read them he is not amused and quickly finds something else to read. Be prepared! I personally love this book but know a few people who can not ""get into"" the book! But I agree with other reviews which say this is not a teach your kid numbers book. But it will teach them to say dog!!!"
5,Fun for baby because Mom and Dad sound Silly!,"My one-year-old loves this book, probably because it requires Mom and Dad to make silly sounds. The first time we read the page where the dogs howl at the moon, she cracked up laughing. It's definelty a must have."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!,Such a fun book and so sweet when my husband reads it to my daughter. Her little eyes light up! Cute book :)
4,Good,"This book is funny and probably as good as Boynton's ""Barnyard Dance!"". It is important to have a good counting book for toddlers. Two such excellent books that are aimed at the slightly older toddler are ""One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish"" by Dr. Seuss and ""One, Two, Three: This Book's for Me"" by Stuart Samuel."
1,condition,"This book took forever to arrive and when it did it was in awful condition. Like disgusting, things spilled on it, pages messed up, etc. This was supposed to be a book for my kid, no way I let my child touch this filthy book.I don't want my money back... but I am not happy with my purchase.-Kevin"
3,Kind of annoying,"My daughter likes this one, but it's hard to read it to her as it is merely a book of 10 dogs with 10 different barks. If you're not feeling very creative, this is the last book you want to see."
3,DOGGIES,One dog. WOOF!Two dogs. WOOF! Yap yap yap!Three dogs. WOOF! Yap yap yap! nnn...nnn...Four dogs. WOOF! Yap yap yap! nnn...nnn... Rruff Rruff.Five dogs. WOOF! Yap yap yap! nnn...nnn... Ruff Ruff.aroof aroofSix queit dogs.Seven dogs. WOOF! Yap Yap! Ruff. nnn... aroof! bark bark. grrrrrEight dogs. WOOF! yap yap! Ruff. nnn... aroof! bark bark. grrr arf arf and one cat Mrrow!
5,Great for toddlers and adults,"Sandra Boynton's books are great for little kids and also for adults because they are humorous and easy to read. Other childrens books are tedious to read and don't make any sense, these books have real creativity that even makes adults smile."
1,Bad Buy,"I bought this book based upon reviews. I have not read it to my grandson yet, but reading it myself, I am not happy! I am wondering if I got the wrong book! There are 8 dogs, NO howling at the moon! It is just 8 dogs barking. I feel cheated. NOT HAPPY!"
2,Annoying to read!!,"I received this from my registery and was super excited to read it! I read it to my bump- BOY is it annoying!! Just imagine reading out loud at least 5 different barks, multiple times- ""woof, arf, rawf"" etc. And it's not just a simple woof, arf, you say it and the barks increase. It was definitely a cute concept if you want to influence your child to become an animal lover, but it is not fun for the parent to read it out loud."
3,It's cute,"I ordered this book because I had never seen this particular Sandra Boynton book in stores. I thought it was just ok - it's not as much fun to read aloud as some of her other books, but the art is cute as always."
3,JUST OKAY,"Normally I love Sandra Boynton's books, but this one I was a little disappointed in. What parent wants to bark and woof for ten pages? That said my daughter does love looking at all the pictures of the different ""doggies"" which is why I gave it 3, and not 2 stars."
4,Doggies,My four year old grandson loved it. I will donate it to the local library as soon as he gets tired of me reading it to him.
5,"Doggies and counting, what more could a kid want?","We got this book for my two-year-old, because she loves doggies and kitties. It was a good call. Boynton's books are all so short, cute, and fun to read--just the right length for the 1-to-2 year old attention span. This one basically counts up through 10 dogs and their various barking styles. My daughter loves to participate in the reading, by counting and repeating each bark. She *loves* it."
4,Best Man for Dummies,The book was well written and gave solid general advice of being the best man. I did not realize however that the book was the UK edition until after I had recieved it.
3,Does an okay job heating up the room,"This heater does a decent job warming up a small room, but I don't think it is very good heater to sit in front of to warm up if you're coming out of the cold. The air coming out is more warm than hot, and it isn't easy to position in such a way that the heat is hitting you where you want. I like the thermostat control, but it is annoying that I have to reprogram the temperature every time I turn the heater on as it defaults to 75 degrees. It is a very safe heater; there aren't any parts that feel hot to the touch, and there's a cutoff switch on the bottom. If the heater tips over or is picked up, it will automatically shut off. The remote control works fine. Overall this heater is acceptable, I don't feel strongly one way or the other about it."
2,Lousy thermostat,"Product manual states a 3.6 degree difference between on and off which is too large of a difference, set it for 68 deg and it doesn't shutoff until 72. I bought this for my bathroom, it is either to hot or to cold, and when it does finally shutoff at setpoint the thermometer climbs a few more degrees, i think the temp sensor is affected by the air being drawn into the unit. I bought it specifically for the thermostat feature and it is terrible and will be returning to costco."
2,Noisy on Auto,"I bought this heater for our daughter's room and like other reviews the Auto is too loud. I can hear it two doors down in our bedroom when it kicks on. As for keeping the room heated, it does a good job but I'll be returning it due to how loud it is."
2,Disappointing Heater,"This heater provides a good amount of heat. However, it is noisy on the high setting, the thermostat works poorly and anytime you adjust the heater, it emits an extremely loud and annoying beeping sound that cannot be turned off or down. I would look elsewhere..."
1,FIRE,Worked fine for 1 year. Almost burned down the house. It was merely plugged in and not turned on.Unplug the unit and quit using it. Should be recalled.
2,Flips breaker,"I bought this a few weeks ago and have had trouble with it tripping the breakers. Our home was built in the late 70's, and I'm not an electrician so I don't know what our amps are for our breaker box. I've tried it in different areas hoping to find a circuit that will allow it to work without trouble. But if I forget I have it on and turn on another appliance, then it's lights out. I will probably return it and look for something that has lower wattage."
3,Beware of seller called ** Todays Concept **,"I ordered this heater from Todays Concept & paid for it (virtually via Paypal) on 11/24/07. Amazon's stock meter said that Todays Concept got these IN STOCK. But nope, the guy just kept avoiding the repeat ship date questions cos' he got zero in stock, as of 12/5/07, words from this guy was: A few more days before he could ship out. On 12/6/07, Amazon stepped in & canceled the order. And still, not a single apology from Todays Concept. Sure that he never took my money, but he wasted nearly 2 weeks of my time while Mass. has been having sub-freezing temperature since 2 weeks ago. Beware of Todays Concept, don't trust their IN STOCK claim. I ordered another one from Amazon today & within 2 hours, I got a tracking # already!"
5,Its a very good Heater.,"I had one since last year and now that is cold again , I bought 2 more.I have one on my Office, on my Room and on my Studio.Good for a 12' x 12'"
1,It's Not Safe,"Pros:1. Worked well when it lasted2. Tip-over preventionCons:1. Tip-over prevention feature is basically a press switch at the base, so whenever the unit is lifted from ground and the switch unpressed, the unit is turned off and settings need to be resetOther thoughts:It prevents you from tipping it over to burn the floor, thus the name Safeheat. However, it DID NOT prevent itself from overheating and melted its front panel face, meaning its buttons got fused to the face and became non-pressable. Luckily it didn't overheat to the point of causing serious consequence except destroyed itself.DeLonghi's customer service did not reply to email of complain about this incident, which happened roughly 4 years ago (couldn't remember the specific year)."
2,DeLonghi Review,"This heater is packaged well (ala looks nice) but it doesn't put out much heat even on the high setting. I do like the ""tip"" safety feature (and it blends with my decor) so it was not a complete waste of money. I would not use this heater for anything more than heating up a small bathroom as you have to be very close to it to feel any warmth. My larger rooms heat better when I use one of the small space heaters I purchased at a local retailer."
2,Fair,"This image is deceiving, as the heater is much smaller than i expected. It also does not generate much heat (and its only very warm). Also, the remote died after 1 day of owning it. Overall, I do not recomend this product unless its used for a closet."
4,"Works well, relatively less noisy","I just started using one today and I like it compared to a couple of other ceramic heaters I have. This one is less noisy, looks good and includes a remote control. Its a bit taller than my other two ceramic heaters but that's what makes it more effective, I think. Good purchase overall. No complaints so far."
5,Not for Kollywood fans,"This book is more suitable for young Tamil children who already speak colloquial Tamil (their mother tongue) and need to learn the written Tamil (also known as Classical Tamil, which was last time updated in the 13th century). It's not really suitable for foreigners who want to be fluent in colloquial Chennai Tamil (the variant used in Kollywood).On the other hand, it's a good book for those interested in Southern Tamil (including Jaffna Tamil), because their speech is closer to the written variant."
3,fifty years?,"nice book with nice pictures and entertaining text. small problem....not actually a 50 year thunderbird collection. almost nothing on the 2005 t-bird and not much more of the 2004. the writer did find space to add filler pictures of many other makes to include jaguar, mustang, buick riviera, chevy monte carlo, and others. still a somewhat nice book but should be bought at a discount."
4,T-bird 50 years,Great book. Owned a '57 t-bird and had to have this book too.Sold the t-bird but still have the book. Nice!
1,They leak!,"Though this product may be the most economical storage bags on the market, they leak! I have experienced NUMEROUS times of these bags leaking when thawing. I recommend spending a bit more $ and buying Lansinoh bags- they are worth it."
3,They're okay,"I used these bags for 8 months when I pumped and stored my breastmilk for my daughter. Only over the past 2 months when I have thawed the milk in a bowl of warm water have I noticed that the milk tends to leak from a seam on the bottom of the bag. Not every bag does this but it is still frustrating when your ""liquid gold"" is being lost. Some of them seem especially hard to open below the zipper, too, and you end up ripping the bag! Next time I am trying other bags!"
2,Lansinoh Bags Are Better,"I normally buy the Lansinoh brand storage bags. I decided to try the Gerber ones because they were cheaper. Its really hard to right on them with a ball point pen. You're not supposed to write on it with a sharpie because there's a chance of contamination. The ziploc seal on two of the twenty five bags was not connected on one side. I also found them harder to pour milk out of. I like the Lansinoh ones because they have two ziploc seals to insure that no milk gets out. They are easier to write on, AND the part you write on is above the seals. I have never had a dysfunctional bag with the Lansinoh ones."
2,Hoping they won't leak now,I bought a box of these last week; so far 2 out of 5 bags broke when I tried to open them! To open the bags it says to pull gently below the zipper - the zipper part detached from the plastic bag; on the other the plastic tore. The bags that did open without breaking were are in my freezer now. After reading some of the other reviews on here I'm hoping they do not leak or break when we need to thaw them out. I'm looking for another brand now.
4,They work for me!!!!!,"The Gerber bags work great for me. I pump severl times at work and store the milk in the bags and freeze when I get home. I dont know what these people are doing with the bags and why they are leaking but I love the bags, and their very convient. They take up less space than bottles."
4,Good Bags,"I used these bags for my first baby 2 years ago and will do it again for my new little girl. I am a physician-in-training therefore had to go back to work when the baby was only 4 weeks old. I had to work many 36 hour shifts therefore I essentially lived on pumping. I froze lots of these bags for one whole year and never had any problems. I did not directly write on the bags, but rather I put the same day's milk in a large freezer bag and labeled it. They are just right for my budget and the fastest/easiest for my busy schedule."
1,Gerber Storage Bags,"When I received this product the box was open, I don't want to use the bags because the box was not protected and I think the bags are dirty or they are not higienical. I feel upset because I wasted my money, I always thought the gerber products were the best but I was wrong."
1,Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!,"These bags leak! I've purchased at least 4 boxes, and all of them have had leaky bags. Some leak upon defrosting, and some leak right from the start. I've switched to Lansinoh bags, because these Gerber Seal N Go bags are such a huge disappointment from an otherwise reliable baby product company."
1,Do not be fooled!,"I generally love Gerber products; however, these bags are terrible. They are hard to open, leak if they re sealed and fall over and don't stand when filled with milk. I'm sorry, but this Gerber product is not alright with me. I'll stick with Lasinoh or First years (the best, but extremly hard to find)."
1,Bags leak and are difficult to use,"My child is now 2 months old and I have been pumping breastmilk since her birth in order to build up a supply. Not only are the bags difficult to pour the milk into, they leak upon defrosting. Today was the first day that I defrosted a frozen bag of milk and soon found that it was leaking in the fridge from the seam at the bottom of the bag. I am very disappointed as I have worked hard every day in order to pump milk. I read similar reviews regarding the leaking but figured it couldn't happen with every bag, however sadly I am wrong. I wish I had used Lansinoh as their bags are thicker, more durable and priced the same as Gerber."
4,Great! :),"I love this step ladder and for us 5'1"" people we need something like this. It's light and very verstile. I like it because it was extermely light for a step ladder and you could store it just about anywhere."
5,Light Ladder,Was searching for this ladder (my Mom has one). Was so glad to find it on Amazon.Could have been packed better. It arrived with a small dent!
3,Great step stool EXCEPT,"QAULITY is great on this stool, it is very light and folds easily, but the folded width is almost 5 inches and the top handle, when open, is not as high as most. Because of this it does not provide much stability when on the top step. I had to return this stool as my storage space was too narrow plus I did not feel secure standing on the top step."
5,Lightweight but....,"This ladder is amazingly lightweight and being so it is a pleasure totransport. However, I was disappointed to find it has a weight limitof 225lb. Since I weigh 242 lbs I am hesitant to actually use it. The product does not have the structural integrity of its heavier cousins. The steps start to creak and shift when I start my ascent and I feel quite uncomfortable being on it.That said, if you are of normal weight it is a great step ladder. It can be lifted with one finger with ease and looks sharp too."
3,Great Verses,"This DVD has some wonderful Bible verses with beautiful pictures. The only I did not think was that great was the quality of the music. It did not sound like it was recorded very well. The selection of music was good, but the recording quality seemed a little bit low. It could have been my DVD player, but I am not sure."
4,Roll Tide!!!!!!,The only issue I had with this product is that it wasn't as long as I had thought. I have worn and washed this item several times and so far it has kept its shape and has not shrunk at all. I have really enjoyed this item!! GO BAMA!!!!!
5,Lovely stories that really hook you...,"A wonderful collection of short stories, and one not so short story, set in many places and many time periods. World War Two, with the SS of course, flashbacks of Vietnam of course, and a band whose music can kill. Well, it may not sound very original it is, in fact, very new and twisted in a lovely matter that makes it all very hard to put down. It was nice to see Erich Zann make a appearance and the first person account of the attack on Innsmouth was amazing to read.Many of the characters are from older, earlier stories, so readingDelta Green: Alien Intelligencewould help somewhat. As well as knowing a LOT of Lovecraft's, and his fellow-writers', works. If you liked this series of short stories may I also suggestDelta Green: Denied to the Enemy (A Call of Cthulhu Mythos Novel of World War II)?"
2,ZZZ...ZZZ...ZZZ,"I hate to admit it, but I am pretty dissapointed. Like the rest of you, I have thoroughly enjoyed the previous books in this serie about the worlds toughest scimitar-slinger and his gang of monster-bashing avengers.However, this book is progressing so slowly that now I have given up! I have been trying to finish it for as long as I can remember, because I really want to get on to the next RAS book. I just can't.I can't even recall what I have read so far.I really regret writing this negative review, but R.A.S. has made me expect the most fantastic experience every time I pick up one of his books."
4,A good change of pace in the series,"You know, if you read the entire legacy of Drizzt straight through (which you may be doing with the new book coming out soon), it is actually quite relaxing to read about a character other than Drizzt. Wulfgar, by no means, is a boring character. Despite what others say, I think this book was actually quite entertaining, and unlike other reviewers, I could care less if Salvatore uses some of the same phrases over sometimes. It really didn't annoy me. These books are meant for entertainment, and to maybe teach us a thing or two along the way, who cares about the occasional grammar slip? Besides, the story was not all that weak, and the action scenes were not all that fantastical (considering there weren't nearly as many of them as usual), and it actually makes some sense in a way that it will likely set up the rest of the series."
2,I hate it!,"I like Salvatore stories, so I ran and bought this piece of romantic crap. Ok, the psicological problems of Wulfgar is a very interesting plot, but the romantic crap of lord Auckney is sooooo boring and the plot is soooooo slow. The good thing, Wulfgar loses Aegis-fang, the bad thing the stupid pink novel that salvatore wanted to share!!!. Better to save your money and ask for borrow it!"
1,This book could have been covered in 4 chapters...,"It is upsetting to see that a once great series, full of great characters and action, has become a very mediocre series filled with boring characters and an author that lacks the ingenuity that hooked us all.I loved most of the previous books by Salvatore, but a true fan must see the denoument of this author, as his books, now, take an entire novel to unfold, what he used to do in one or two chapters.Spine of the World, would have been better off, being a 4 chapter part of a real novel...the plot and story were not enough to carry it for a full 300 pages.I hate to say it, but perhaps Bobby Salvatore has finally sold us out, turning out garbage instead of the high quality writing that he got us all addicted to, such as in The Crystal Shard, or the Dark Elf Trilogy.Think about what I said...we all know it to be true"
1,Overly unimpressed,"I don't mind the fact that the book isn't really written very well, and I will admit I am not pleased about this book not having the main character in it. Those two things don't make this a bad book. What makes this a bad book is that it is very repetitive in regards to Wulfgar's story arc and the development is atrociously slow. It was like a bad season finale. The other half of this story is a bad rendition of a Shakespearean love story. Salvatore will never be mentioned with great writers, but he was able to create an interesting world with interesting characters. None were in this book, and I am now leaning towards just googling the series and finding a summary of the remaining books in fear of another book filled with fodder.The Spine of the World: The Legend of Drizzt, Book XII"
4,Nice read,"Not all foes can be vanquished with his mighty Aegis-Fang. This truth Wulfgar learns the hard way. Our favorite barbarian falls to new lows as he goes from hero to barfly. Still trying to recover from his ordeal at the hands of Errtu, Wulfgar hides behind the bottle rather than face his problems.Wulfgar finds solace in the bed of Delly, a barmaid who falls for the tormented big guy. Though it does make things interesting in the future when Wulfgar and Cattie-brie meet again in the future.A good book, though this should not be a surprise from the likes of Salvatore. A bit drawn out at parts but still a good read."
4,Awesome,"This book, although it does not feature Drizzt still delivers everything your expect in a Bob Salvatore novel. I for one truly enjoyed getting to know Wulfgar and his troubles in dealing with the memories of being trapped and tortured by the Balor Errtu. This book is a story well told, with twists and turns that weave into the very soul of the ""Companions of the Hall"" stories."
1,Don't bother with this one,"What a dissapointment. I have read EVERYTHING Mr. Salvatore has written and was always happy. Until now. This book is a pointless trek through Wulfgar's uninteresting melancholy just to set up (I think) the possibility of a new series.If you HAVE to read it, skip to the end.And next time, Mr. Salvatore, NO DRIZZT = NO DICE!"
4,Long wait in shallow waters,"I have always been a dedicated fan of R.A. Salvatore, especially his character drizzt. Unfortunatly, this book was a let down as Salvatore did not describe things in as much depth as he usualy would, but this was still a great read. One thing that disapointed me was that wulfgar lost hammer andd this really anoyed me. The main reason I like wulfgar is due to his hammer, and i hope in ""Servant of the Shard"", he will get it back. I also found it pathetic thst at te end everyone believed meralda's baby was wulfgars daughter. People like Priscila should of realised his shouldn t be so. As I say, I waited a long time for this book, but it was a bit shallow."
2,Someday,"Again Salvatore gives us an average Drizzt type book. The deveolpment of Wulfgar is excellent however way too much effort and time was spent on the peasant girl and her struggles. I personally cared not at all what happened to her, one way or the other. Salvatore needs to put more drama and hardship in his Drizzt type novels in order make the good times seem better. He succeeded in doing this in his Demon Wars series, but I feel, has not done it in this series since the Legacy. Overall a good read if you like Salvatore, but he can do better."
1,What do you expect?,"Salvatore is not a talented author. He has NEVER been a talented author. The original Icewind Dale trilogy does have a certain amateurish charm, but the man's style is not one that bares close inspection. Yes, at one point I did enjoy the minutely choreographed battle scenes. And yes, I am no longer ten years old. Currently, I prefer novels that emphasize interesting characters and compelling stories. Unfortunately, these are very definitely ol' R.A.'s weakness.Very definitely to be missed."
2,It was horrible,"worst book ever, wanted to die after readeing, The biggest SUXOR!!!!21111!!! omg sucked so bad. Dont waste a opile of poop on it, sucks."
3,"Good, NOT GREAT (Three stars)","Good book, but not great. I've held off reading this one for a little while and finally got around to it this week. I just wish the book had offered less droning detail and more story and character progression. Not enough actual fresh content for me."
1,Not impressed!,"I never thought I would actually say this, considering the character he once was, but Wulfgar is a whiner. Get over it, guy. I have to throw my vote in with those who say ""thumbs down""."
5,A break from Drizzt but not the Barbarian,"This book is the second book in the ""Paths of Darkness"" series. I have to admit, I was a little weary about picking this book up. I had heard many mixed reviews about the books without Drizzt. I am so glad that I read this book!!!!This book is very different then the other Drizzt books. Even the writing format is a little different. Every other chapter Salvatore switches characters, from Wulfgar, to a young peasant girl turned Queen named Meralda.I was a bit confused with the story of Meralda, but it all comes together. Although Her and Wulfgar's paths only cross for a few chapters, they are a major influance on each other, changing each others lives for good or for bad (I will let you read and find out).All and all, I thought this was an exellent book. I read it in 2 days with not problem at all. I enjoyed it a lot and think any fan of Drizzt, his companions, or his enemies will love this book and the others in the ""Paths of Darkness"" series."
3,"OK, but not his best...","This book was merely OK, from an author we all know can write so well. One big problem is that Salvatore left out the character we all love - the one and only Drizzt Do'Urden! He has instead reverted to writing about a big, bulky, drunken brute ~ Wulfgar! I won't ruini the story for you, as it is worth a read, but though the focus on Wulfgar is important to the series, I don't much like it. Don't get me wrong, it was necessary for the plot of the books, and nobody could've done it like Salvatore! It's just ~ not Drizzt... If you've read The Silent Blade, however, you're going to want to get this book to continue the series!"
5,Great,It would of been better if there was more about drizzt and cattibre but overall it was a great book of wulfgars redemtion
1,Salvatore Fans - SKIP THIS ONE,"Having read the whole Drizzt saga, and enjoyed it, I can safely say this book is a complete waste of time. Wulfgar was never a favorite of mine, so a whole book dedicated to this boring fellow was a real snore.It is pretty clear that Mr. Salvatore is trying to spin him off into his own series."
4,Why couldnt Wulfgar just die in the Prisoners Carnival!!!,"This book was a great book but the first half was soo boring then it built up and got more interesting but Wulfgar is probably my most ""disliked"" character in all the Drizzt books(i include this one)Maybe the next book Salvatore will show mercy to Wulfgar and kill him again for another 3-4 books-haha- or maybe bring the whole team back togethor at least. Worth reading though."
5,One of his best....,"This book is great... this one is more serious then the others books of the series. it's more like the ""Demon"" series then the forgotten realm. This book is more for adult and surely not for children. I think it's why some peoples give bad review. If you love great story with surprising ending you will love it. But if you are the kind to like only action (""à la"" Executionner) and you think that story is just a think to slow down the action stay far from Spine of the World because the strong side of Spine of the world is his great story."
1,This Book Was Terrible!,I love Drizzit's books but this was horrible. It's only about a drunken hagard Wulfgar! Were is Drizzit and the rest of the gang! What about the Christal Shard and Jarxale come on. I like Salvatore but he can do better than this
2,Insipid Love Story,"I am a big fan of Salvatore and have enjoyed almost every Dark Elf book as well as the Cleric and Dragon's Dagger series. However, I was none too enthused with this book and it took me a great deal of time to read. I barely glossed over anything having to do with Jaka and I was disappointed with the absence of Drizzt, I kept expected him to pop up especially since exerpts from his journal were used. I also found Wulfgar's struggles with alcoholism, flashbacks and wavering moral fortitude somewhat forced and his continuing escapes from ""justice"" with no gratitude for those who helped him tiring. I will not read this book again and if anyone wants to buy it I'll sell!"
1,Holy sh**! What's this book for!,"What a dissapointment. I knew things would go downhill after Wulfgar returned from the dead, a really crappy idea. I think, if Errtu so desperately needed a prisoner, it should have been Zaknafain. At least that guy was cool. Drizzt was missing a lot. And Salvatore, with this new Wulfgar, SO breaks character. ANYWAY, just skip this book, people. Unless you like sappy romance crap, don't do this to yourselves. I'm sorry I did!"
3,Salvatore's FIrst Book I Was Able To Actually Put Down,"I'm an avid reader of Mr. Salvatore's work. I enjoy his rich characterizations combined with excellent plots. The problem with this book is at times it seems to drag--as if the author was suffering from writer's block and was desperately trying to invent a way out of it.Once I was through the first half of the book the pace picked up considerably and I enjoyed the rest.If you like the Drizzt-Wulfgar-Bruenor-Cattie Brie series you'll probably want to read this regardless what others say--I did. Was I disatisfied by the lack of Drizzt? No, as a matter of fact some of my favorite books by Salvatore aren't in this series."
4,A Great Read Even Without Drizzt,"This is great book and I definitely recommend it. Note to all Drizzt fans out there, Drizzt isn't in this book. This is all about how Wulfgar recovers from the torments of Errtu. His friend from the last book, Morik the Rogue, is in this one as well and plays as Wulgar's sidekick. Basically, Wulfgar is victimized throughout the whole book. First, he is set up to where everyone thinks he is the one who tried to kill Captain Deudormont by two thugs in Luskan. Second, a girl claims he ""ravished"" her, as an attempt to cover her premarital relations. In both cases he is sentenced to death in the most brutal ways possible. It surprised me how much trouble Wulfgar got into in this book. I would give this book five stars, but they didn't have Drizzt or any of the others in the book."
3,A Decent Offering,"This latest offering in Salvatore's series in the Forgotten Realms Universe, while good, was not nearly a match for the rest of the books of the series. The lack of appearances by Drizzt, Bruenor or the others was something I could easily deal with, though I did miss them. What I had trouble swallowing was the incredibly slow pace of the novel. The character development was narrow and confined mainly to Wulfgar's inner struggle, and the evolution of Morik the Rogue as a character. The action sequences, while enjoyable, did seem a little stagnant to me. I hope that the next book in the series will make up for where this one lacked."
3,"Not too bad, BUT...","After the MARVELLOUS ""Silent Blade"" this seems kinda... flat? I know that the IDEA in the Icewind Dale trilogy was to make Wulfgar the big hero, but as it is: Drizzt rules. Thus I was a bit... unamused by the idea that Wulfgar (clearly a ""back-up character"" in the former books) would get a Solo-book for himself. I recall seeing Drizzt mentioned only once. On one page. (snort!) Still; a good book if you like D&D/Forgotten Realms, but to my tastes Wulfgar seems too brutish and shallow to ever surpass Drizzt's level of charisma. A must for those who've read all the Drizzt&Fellows books, though. (Gotta keep up to the story!) ... My 10 cents."
4,"Excellent overview, somewhat confusing","After a long search, I selected this as the best book available for providing a historical overview of the social effects of electronic communication media for my college course, ""The Information Age."" The author clearly identifies the various types of technology: audio, visual, multimedia, and he does a nice job of assessing the impact of these individually and in combination. The latter third of the book becomes increasingly confusing, however, as he attempts to extend today's technologies into the future and predict their effects. My students found the book very interesting, and the author's ideas generated quite a bit of discussion."
2,"Broad attempt, mediocre delivery","Intial chapters on the history of writing as a techonlogy were captivating. But the book quickly fades into conjecture and irrelevance as he moves on to current and future technologies - similar to any of the dozens of other books proclaiming a deeper understanding of the meaning of Internet, or the future of information technology. Overall I wouldn't recommend this."
1,Not as profound as the author thinks it is,"In this book, Levinson argues that information needs to be to the point and delivered concisely. If only he'd practice what he preaches. The information is solid and well researched, but it is presented in such an overly verbose, rambling manner that it is totally unreadable."
1,Unuseable,"I ordered this clock for my bathroom. It arrived intact and I put a AA battery in it. It ran less than a day. I tried multiple batteries, but no luck. It would run for up to 1 minute but that was the longest it would run. When I went to the company's website for information (www.polderinc.com) as listed on the directions included with the clock I found nothing related to the merchandise, just a bunch of weblinks. That was $ down the drain."
4,Does the trick,"I have the same spoon which is probably over 10 years old and I thought this one will be the same quality item. While it certainly looks the same (if only more shiny) the spring is very stiff and it opens/closes very slowly. I hope it'll get better in time. however, it does the trick."
1,poor quality,I bought 3 and the first two I opened did not make a great seal with the tea slipping out between the cracks. Was able to use 1 once.
3,It's OK but not great,Initially it was good for steeping tea but it doesn't stay closed so some of the tea leaves come out so I stopped using it. The seller was great. The product arrived well packaged and sooner than expected.
1,Cheap quality,I bought this product for my tea and It only last me for one month.The quality of the product is not good.
5,An interesting concept from Norway !,"I first came across this tea-infuser in Bergen (Norway) where it's known as a TESIL. I was quite taken in by how practical it was when dealing with loose leaf tea, but using it as if it was a tea bag. I found one on Amazon and went ahead and ordered it immediately. It works great, and even looks great."
1,"Doesn't close all the way, wouldn't buy it again.",The quality of the product is not good. The halves don't close together. The head is bent. I would return them but it isn't worth the time.
1,This was THE WORST product that I have ever purchased!!!,"My tea cup was filled with tea leaves. It didn't sealed completely. Overall, it didn't do what it was supposed to!!"
1,Piece of Crap,"It doesn't completely close and is Very hard to open because (according to my husband) the handle pieces are not put on correctly. Also, the mesh openings are too big for ordinary tea leaves. We have an old one (another brand, I guess) that we're still using. This one is completely useless, a waste of money."
1,Worthless,"The infuser leaked a steady stream of tea leaves into my tea, no matter what I tried. I threw it out."
4,better than expected,"This is an early novel by Josephine Tey (Gordon Daviot) which, strangely is better than her early mystery novels (Man in the Queue or A Shilling for Candles). In this book her languaging is just as good, but her descriptions of things are better and, more importantly, her characterizations are superior. Perhaps because she need not worry about the mystery, she spends more time and puts more thought into character depth and development. The story is good. A farm boy goes to war, has a tough time afterwards, & meets a host of real characters--a con artist, a merciful major, a nasty corporal, a friendly thief, a father-like safe cracker, & a heart breaking woman. He sees good breaks & bad ones too. The only negative I can see is that it's rather passive (to a degree) whereby his choices don't seem to change his fate/destiny/karma. The ending is not for the squeamish, but has poignancy too. It's well crafted--more like Tey's later mysteries (e.g. To Love & Be Wise)."
5,How to Talk to your Angels,This books makes a lot of sense if you are a believer. You will never feel alone again once you learn to talk to your angels. This is the best gift you can give yourself.
5,Extremely insightful.,"Many books on this subject give examples of what ""other people"" have experienced. Kim relates personal experiences and feelings when first becoming conscious of relating to her angels. Reading this book made me feel like I was reading my own stories, with a few variations. It made me want to seek out Kim for a personal reading, which I have had on several occasions. Kim genuinely knows from whence she speaks."
5,Very informative and down to earth.,This book reinforces information that I'd gotten from several other books on the same topic. I especially appreciated Kim's very simple and down to earth (no pun intended) explanations of the spirit world and how it coexists with our earthly existence. I plan to give copies of this book to friends and family members as presents. Her non-religious presentation of this information can be a spiritual help to both the religious and those who profess no particular religious faith.An excellent book.
5,Terrific book!!,Kim does an excellent job in this book!!! This book has been a great comfort to me since losing my fiancé in January... I recommend it highly!!!
3,not what I expected,This book was not what I expected. THis book was written by someone who claims to be a medium and talks to all sorts of people.
1,Save your Money! DON'T WASTE IT ON THIS superfical BOOK!!!!!,"I felt that I had wasted my money on this book. The most basic abc's of Angel Talking were put forward superficially!!!!!! Save your money! The people whom this book has worked for was only because they have a ""gift"" that not many people have. Don't waste your money! The content in this book did not work for me or ANY OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO TRIED IT!!!!! (17 people)!!!"
1,This is a scary book,"I don't like to write bad reviews, but this one is bad. Of all the Angel books I've read this one says you can talk to the deceased. Uh, I don't think so. I had nightmares after reading just 3 chapters. I read chapter 1 and said ""O.K."". After chapter 2 it got scary. I don't recommend this book at all"
4,Informative & Well Written,"Gonzalez writes, in his two volume series the story of Christianity from inception to more modern contexts. This book is a great overview and survey of how the church evolved and where it is today. This book is great for people of any denomination, and can give everyone a better view of where the diverse views in doctrine we see today, came from. This book is a must have if you want to know the foundation of the Christian church. I recommend this book to lay leaders and pastors alike. It is also great because it will point you in different directions if you want to go deeper, with where to go to find the information.Gonzalez delivers a fine work, and he is to be commended for it. I recommend this book without reservation."
5,Easy read,This book is very thorough and informative while being a very easy read. It is laid out in a very logical sequence. I highly recommend it.
3,Very Readable,"I found this book to be eminently readable. It reads like a good novel. As an overview of Christian history this is an excellent book. If you are looking for something more in depth, however, this is not the text for you."
3,Ok for history of Christianity,"This was a requirement reading for my Church History class. Although it does not follow the doctrine's of the Catholic Church, it still contains good historical information. The book is easy to read."
4,An indispensable intro to pre-Reformation Christianity.,"From the conquests of Alexander the great to the missionary efforts of Frances Xavier in Goa, Professor Gonzalez has crafted an intimate, accessible and scholarly work. He covers vast territory (over 15 centuries) with careful detail, yet with sufficient brevity to allow both the casual reader and the student to profit from the effort. A perfect selection for a single semester survey or an addition to your library."
3,"Good overview, but insufficient for advanced students","Gonzalez's work is highly accurate, and provides a good summary of the church history of the period. However, for advanced students, its value is largely as a means of refreshing the memory about developments in a particular period. It does not have the degree of the history of doctrinal development, or even of all aspects of religious conflicts, that would be helpful in graduate studies.As well, I did not care for the writing style, which seemed on a par with what ""grammar checkers"" would allow as not being ""pretentious"" (translation: nothing above the level of an eight year old.) Though I'd consider the term ""readable"" to be very complimentary, this book goes too far, placing the language on such an elementary level that I sometimes had to stop a moment and remember this was not a child's book."
1,"Kindle Edition needs ""Page numbers""","If you need to cite from this book, stay away from Kindle Edition.There is no page numbers. only location numbers which is useless for citing.Seems like I gotta buy the paperback again. Paying money double...Amazon! Please add page numbers in this book!"
1,Lords Of The L.H.P.,"Frivilous waste, but a great title. Save your money. I overspent on gaining a copy to find it a vast dissapointment, don't make the same mistake."
3,Movie great -- this copy was damaged at the end,"The movie was very funny, but the tape was damaged at the end. We had seen it before, but we wanted a copy for home."
1,"I almost smiled, once.","This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Everything in it was done before, by the same movie character, played by the same actor. Total waste of my time."
4,A MINNESOTA MOVIE....YOU BIG PEE PEE HEADS!,"A happy surprise for MN residents. Most of the film references are of MN places, people etc;. Stillwater, Hibbing, Goodue, Cass Lake, Fergus Falls, Fridley, Orono etc. Not surprisingly Pat Proft (writer) grew up in Columbia Heights, MN."
2,Bad,Git the DVD no scratches but it doesn't play all movie couldn't finish it Was real sad got a classic movie
5,My Review...,"I thought this was one funny movie. Neilson always brings out comedy in the other movies flaws. The main story line is he is accused of murder, and he must go on a hunt to find the real killer. The movie really spoofs the Fugitive, being that he does everything that Ford did, just a bit funnier.In spoofs, there really is no plot, exept the title. For example, Airplane!, Scary Movie, Mafia, Spy Hard etc.. When you see a spoof, you know it took a lot of time and effort to do. There were pretty good effects in the film too.The plot is OK, it is what is right for Leslie Neilson. I hopoe he continues. Do you understand the guy is nearly 80 years old? The stuff he does in his films, well most 60 year olds can not do. Congrats.Thanks,R Y A N"
5,HILLARIOUS,"First off,I loved ""The Fugitive"" and the other movies this movie spoofs,and spoofs well I might add, but I also love a good laugh and this movie provides those in abundance. Nielsen is at his best as is the supporting cast,especially Richard Crenna his send up of the T.L.Jones character is brutally funny.Trust me, if you want to laugh watch this movie, although you will probably have to rewind it several times to get all the jokes you missed while you were laughing."
3,Only Fair,Parodies and satires can be great fun or they can drag on unmercifully. This film does something very difficult; it takes a middle road. It is not the great spoof that some of Nielsen's comedies are but neither is it a complete write off. It is not great. It is not awful. It is only fair.The main target for this parody is THE FUGITIVE. It gets in some effective shots at that great thriller but it also takes a few free throws from some other shows as well. They are mostly funny but not spectacular.This is worth a watch if you are in the mood for a silly comedy but it should not be a first choice.
4,The next best thing to Hot Shots,"Pat Proft is absolutely a hilarious writer and after watching this i could tell that most of my favorite scenes in Hot Shots were written by him. This movie is hilarious and one of those movies you can watch over and over and still find things you missed before. I hope Pat Proft makes more movies like this. If you like Hot Shots, or the Naked Gun movies definetly BUY this movie. I've watched this again and again and i still crack up every single time. Turn up the volume so you don't miss anything some of the jokes are very subtle, while others are right in your face. Absolutely Hilarious."
5,WAY BETTER THAT SPY HARD,This movie was very well done. Having tons of laughter included. This movie combines quite a few movies and tv shows to give it the right ingredients. Its just plain Hilarious. Forget Spy Hard and buy Wrongfully Accused.
4,Wrongfully treated,"I enjoyed this film a lot. Reviewers may not have liked it at all, but I liked it. A typical Leslie Nielsen film, I'd say. Better than ""Spy Hard"".I hope ""Titanic Too: It Missed The Iceberg"" becomes a hit. I was disappointed to see ""Wrongfully Accused's"" box office results. But it is a good movie."
1,I'd give my copy away...,"...but would have to really hate the recipient. This is the Worst movie that I've ever seen.I normally like Nielsen's comedies, but this one just makes me cry for the wasted time. In the DVD commentary, the director jokes that he was picked because he is fast and cheap. Unfortunately, I think this movie is a Hollywood joke on the audience. The film-makers realize that they can make money on Anything since apparently We have no taste.There are lots of attempted gags, but zero subtlety. A spoof needs to be based on more than simply setting up recognizable moments from a random collection of better movies."
5,stupidly funny,I thought it was funny how they brought all kinds of different movies together. I loved the part where the guy was swiming with the fish.
5,BETTER THAN ALL THE NAKED GUNS!!!,This Movie is Hilarious and in my opinion Leslies funniest movie EVER! It's a must see for the endless laughs...
4,Another brilliant Leslie Nielsen spoof.,"I own Spy Hard,Dracula:Dead And Loving It,and all the Naked Gun movies and as soon as it's out for video retail,Wrongfully Accused is going right in the video collection with them.I cannot get enough of Leslie Nielsen spoofs,and WA is no exception.Absolutely delightful."
1,Toilet Humor,"I saw this movie a day after I saw ""The Fugitive"". This movie had alot of laughs. Like the Marshall who is supposed to play the Tommy Lee Jones character was halarious, they made fun of him very well. I also like Leslie Nielson style of comedy. The thing is in the last 15 minutes the movie just stops being funny. This isn't one of the best Parodys I have seen. Go see some of his better movies like The Naked Gun and Airplane. Overall see this movie if you want some good laughs but when its over you won't be totally satisfied."
4,many successful gags,"most of this movie was very funny. Very funny spoof movie. Miles better than Spy Hard. Unfunny when spoofing other movies, as someone else said, especially Titanic spoof at end very stupid. Sit through the credits at the end."
5,FUNNY!,"For all you people out there who love dumb movies that would go through anything to get you a quick laugh, you'll love this one! Leslie Nielsen is Leslie Nielsen in Wrongfully Accused, the story of how HIbbing Goodhue is murdered by a one armed, one legged, one eyed man. This movie is great. The actors are great. And the jokes are great."
3,Completely silly,"This movie definitely falls under the category of 'guilty pleasure'; the jokes are childish and a stream of parodies that will date very quickly and played with Leslie Nielson's trademark deadpan sincerity. Grab a bar of chocolate, give your brain a holiday and embrace the absolute silliness!"
5,Leslie Neilson is STILL THE KING OF COMEDY!!!!!!,Neilson did a great job as always!! If you are a Neilson fan I would highly recommend this movie. Very Funny! I never stopped laughing!!!
5,Its about time,"I got one for my son's birthday. Finally I get to watch my husband having fun with the kids. Our 10 year old especially loves football and looks forward to their short training sessions together. Plus the players are so ""cool"". My husband has a great time because he finally has something to do with them and the kids love having his attention! It's just really great to see them having so much fun together. My sister is returning the video game she got for her kid for Christmas and is buying one of these. Thanks for giving us the choice."
2,FOUND IT MUCH CHEAPER,"Unfortunately, right after ordering the product, I found it more than 100.00 Dollars cheaper at the Dallas Cowboys page. I regreted my purchase deeply."
3,its okay,"movie is good, but would like to be able to purchase regular format instead of letterbox,,some people don't have choice to screen size."
4,Your Friends Will Envy You,"I am the proud owner of three ""F5D5230-4"" routers, and I have one at home, one in my car, and one at the office. Setup was so easy, that I had everything running in five minutes. I docked it one star because the manual is incomprehensible to English-speaking people. Whenever people ask me what that fantastic looking little box is with all those wires, I just lean back in my chair and proudly say ""this is the mother of all routers, it's the F5D5230-4""."
3,Good Router But Vulnerable,"This is not a bad router for the price. It's packed with features, such as a virtual server, and restrictive web access settings. The user manual, while better than nothing, is rather sketchy in places. One problem with the router that appears to be a design flaw is that it does not stop ""ping of death"" attacks on the Internet, which have become much more prevalent of late. My recommendation is to purchase a more recent router with better firewall control options (This router has only ""on"" or ""off""). That way you can be sure you will be fully protected."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad product, I've used it for 6 months or so, but requires too many resets for my taste. After 2 or 3 days of use, traffic through the router slows to a crawl, which requires me to reset the router. It's annoying."
5,I'd Give It A 10 If Possible,... Right outta the box it I was up and running in less than five minutes after having set up my network and cable modem. I have a desktop and laptop hooked to the router...The router though lets me transfer data between the two networked computers at blazing speeds. 700 megs in about 5 minutes. This is mainly due to a 300 P2 laptop hooked to a Belkin network card in a PCMCIA slot which is not as fast as my PCI based desktop NIC. The laptop's HD has sub-standard read and write speeds. Setup with the router was easy and considering I knew nothing about networking beforehand it was a plus.All in all this router is in the economy price range and it works well providing your ISP is up to speed. I've never been disconnected from the cable except during Hurricane Lili...and that was for about 12 hours because of power lines down.
4,Inspiring documentary,"This DVD is a very passionate portrait of the work and it does relate a number of facts well. However, when Tilson and other musicians talk about the music, they do not go into great detail. There is no analytical approach as such. Some issues are mentioned but not explained further, such as polyrhythm or polytonality, and at some points it would be nice to see the score to be able to follow the explanations in more depth.All in all, though, just having the video of the orchestra performing is worth getting this DVD and the documentary is a good starting point for more in depth explorations of oneself."
2,Very disappointing,"This is easily the worst DM I have heard post-1985; some of their early stuff was pretty bad but I just chalk that up to being experimental. I had high hopes too considering 8 mixes, and even videos included on the enhanced CD. Don't get me wrong, I am even a fan of techno and electronica, but these variations are loud and too industrial for my tastes. I admit I bought this single without hearing the originals, but it's really the first Depeche disc I've been so unhappy about. I've tried to sell it but good luck unloading it, they seemed to overproduce this one. Make sure you listen to the samples before you venture on this purchase."
3,Not for wristwatch collectors,This book is primarily written for collectors of pocket watches and only gives cursory information regarding wristwatches. Should be titled: Collecting Pocket Watches
2,"should be titled "" collecting American pocket watches""..","The book is well written, and is primarely about watches produced in the USA, and pocket watches at that. There are a lot of illustrations, and describtions of most of the principles of the art of watchmaking."
5,Excellent Collection,"I have read several collections of ghost stories, and this collection is the best of the lot. A large majority of the stories have great twists andd cast a palpable ghostly atmosphere. Superb!"
3,another 3 stars for the babidi saga.,"although eighteen has stopped being evil. she never stops beingdevious. it was nice see her knee hercule in the gut. the fight between Gohan and Dabura is somewhat boring. And once again the villan makes a mistake by telling them what he is doing. despite my complaning, this is a good video and you should by it."
4,One of the shortest and excellent fights ever!,"This dvd is a memorable DVD in many ways. The excellent supersonic fight between Gohan and Dabura showed us exactly how Gohan has been lazy over the past seven years. The Japanese version is a excellent version. 20 years and growing strong, Dragon Ball Z is still a series which will be remembered for ages to come. Avoid the english version they hire very unprofessional amateurs from the Ringling Brother's Circus. The top reason why the english version is so lackluster is that they have pathetic voices and there's constant annoying electric guitar music in the background every second. The Japanese version has very compelling music and the voices are funny and they are better than most of the english voices. Caution: This movie is recommend for ages 11 or older for some very mild violence and constant mild language."
4,Here comes the Buu saga?,This starts off the Buu saga which is the last saga of DBZ and these episodes are good not the best but good. But this dvd comes out after they show the episodes in cartoon network. I like the dvds cuase of the original japanese voices.you should buy this dvd if I was you.
5,excellent,"Thanks, great product, surrendered on time at a fair price. it was already installed in the car working perfectly. ok"
5,Entertaining,"Having read many historical books over many years I found this book very entertaining and an easy read; unlike the text book approach, which is good. Well researched; evidenced for example by certain opinions (such as the Scottish background creating certain grudges so to speak);opinions I agree with together with dropping some minor but interesting side bits such as similar quotes form other people ( I don't want to give too much away). This collectively makes an enjoyable read for young adults & older regardless of whether you are interested in history, the sea or just plain bold adventure. I like the way the book focuses on the man & events, not a detailed textbook on the entire war, its causes & results itself which is the author's aim. This is of course encompassed in the book but in a way that is easily understood without drifting from the main plot. I dare say the author thoroughly enjoyed writing this book; I certainly enjoyed reading it."
5,The real story of a naval hero,"Callo's book, many of the other recent historical novels of the same period, helped me better understand the difficulties faced by our new nation and it's leaders. John Paul Jones, like his peers Franklin, Jefferson and Washington, was not a hero but rather became one because of the challenges he faced both on the sea and in the politics of the new nation. The values and traditions we still follow today are well described and as a retired Navy Officer I better understand the origins of our Navy and Jones' contributions. I strongly recommend this book."
1,READ the fine print!,"The product title is false advertising ""Super EPA by NOW Foods - (1200mg - 120 Softgels)"". It takes two Softgels to equal 1200mg. So you don't get 1200mg out of each of the 120 Softgels as the title implies. This means there are only 60 doses in the bottle making it twice as expensive.I missed the fine print under ""Product Features"" and only read the Ingredients which does not specify that it takes 2 Softgels to get the listed EPA 720mg and DHA 480mg. I don't believe having to take twice as much to get the listed dosage is a feature.My error, but I will never buy again!"
1,Poor Quality,I ordered the football helmet display case. When we opened it the base was scratched us and a corder was chipped off. The acrylic top was cracked at the bottom corner. I do not recommend this product based on its poor craftsmanship.
3,Woo-Ping,"OK, I just wanted to make sure you read the review before you buy this. Woo ping does the action direction in this and Hwang jang lee and John Liu is in it, but the real failing point is the guy playing duel roles as brother and brother. The story certainly isn't one of the worst, but the fu in this one only has a couple of good highlights, they should have had both brothers die, and had Liu and Lee just duke it out for about an hour."
3,PACKNJ,I ordered this watch on Sunday and it arrived in two days. This is the first time I purchased something of a personal nature on Amazon without seeing it first. The blue face is a little darker than the picture and the hands do not illuminate as mentioned in the product details. The band is wide and a little too long. I would have preferred a titanium band but it was not available. I hope it keeps good time. - - -
1,Minimizing Greatness,"Ms. Baldwin's well-meaning little book is remarkable for its errors. Anyone with any interest in St. Catherine's actual life should locate a second-hand copy of Johannes Jorgensen's biography. Ms. Baldwin confuses dates, ignores facts (Tommaso della fonte was apparently ordained at 10, according to her!), and doesn't proofread. She gushes interminably. There are novels about St. Catherine's life; Louis de Wohl's _Lay Siege to Heaven_ is still in print. Read that! It's much closer to the facts!"
5,Incredible story,"If you enjoy fishing and are of an intellectual bent, you might thoroughly enjoy the author's tale of throwing away a boring (if solid) career in favor of pursuit of happiness through fly-fishing and guiding.The tales strike multiple chords and share experiences gleaned from the wild west."
4,jreed76745,"i bought this for my 9 yr old niece,I was shocked to know she even knew who Pat Benetar was when she asked for it. She was very excited, and loves the CD =)"
3,This should have been released in 1989...,"and called BEST SHOTS. Nice compilattion (except for the awful ONE LOVE song) that actually only corrects the 1989 BEST SHOTS cd with the hits it lefdt of (Some even top 20 hits!). Sadly, with this compilation ending with the 2 songs from 1988's WIDE AWAKE IN DREAMLAND, it makes Pat llok like an 80's star. I would have liked to see at least one track each from her 90's output, but, this will do...until the next Benatar compilation."
2,50/50,The first half the cd was okay but it had a huge chunk taken out of it so only the first 10 tracks play
1,Too Many Edits!,"It's inexcusable that nearly half (9) of the songs are edits. A few tracks could have been omitted since they weren't ""hits"" at all, such as ""One Love,"" ""Hell Is for Children"" and ""Precious Time,"" none of which charted."
3,Popular in The Eighties,"In the 80's there she was with Cindy Lauper and Merdona (I can't spell it Madonna, as that means Saint Mary), and there was Blondie.I suppose Ms. Benetar's music contributed something to that period of time, however her music no longer very significant.Blondie remains a classic.It is good to see that there are still devotees to her music."
5,Excellent,"I had forgotten just how good Pat Benatar was, and this album reminded me. I never bought a Pat Benatar album before, but had enjoyed many of her songs growing up and when i saw this compilation, I got it, and have listened to it several times since.You can see and listen to the play list up at the top, so I won't talk about that, suffice to say that all of her top 40 singles are on the album. There is also a brief history of her life which I found interesting to read, including her first husband (which is how she got the name Benetar), and the fact her monther was an opera singer.The other thing I took away from this album is a much greater appreciation for her talent. The woman really could sing, in stark contrast to a lot of the acts of the '80s that were all image. This performer had talent and I am glad I am finally able to recognize it."
2,Shortened and edited,Pat rocks! But why would anyone want shortened and edited versions of the songs? You're better off buying them as individual MP3s.
5,Great service,Great job shipping and product was in awesome shape. I love it. Thanks so much. Would def buy from you again!
5,Best Female Singer Of The Past 40 Years.,"Pat Benatar is a natural. This compilation has been thoroughly reviewed, so I will focus on four very different songs. Her phenomenal voice comes piercing through on ""Heartbreaker,"" a jaunty tune with catchy lyrics & intense energy. In ""I need a lover,"" she deciphers a females self-awareness that is rarely heard from in this genre of music. ""We Live For Love,"" is a smooth sensual song that appeals to the romantic in all of us. This one is good for dancing or driving on a breezy autumn day. ""Hell Is For Children,"" a deeply disturbing tune with its descriptions of child abuse. It brings out any decent persons protectiveness towards kids everywhere. Lastly, in ""Love Is A Battlefield."" She takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of emotions. The honest lyrics & her perfect delivery makes one ponder the title. All of her fans will be pleased with this entire compilation. It has no flaws."
4,Pat Benatar Greatest hits,"The cd exceeded my expectations! It let me remember the songs that i had forgot or let lapse in my memory. thank you , amazon"
5,Pat Benatar CD is great to workout to,I bought this CD because I love always loved Pat Benatar's music. I don't think she's ever done a song I didn't like. The only time I get to listen to this CD is when I'm working out on my ellipse machine. It keeps me motivated to continue until the end. It is currently my #1 choice.
4,"Most songs ok, needs longer version of Shadows Of The Night",Shadows of the night is the short version on this CD. I would download the longer version. Otherwise the CD contains a collection of very good music. I highly recommend it.
5,Blast from the past,"As someone who grew up (literally since one of my first concerts was at a club, JB Scotts, where she played when she first started out) listening to Pat Benatar, it was great to throw this CD in the stereo and listen to why she's an underrated performer in my view. It's a great compilation."
2,not their strongest effort...by a longshot,"Only 3 songs here, none of which are among their best. Production values are nominal, as you might expect from a BBC session. For the completist only; get the rest of their catalog (Anyway, Fearless, in particular) before you spring for this one."
5,excellent,"My basement floods, like crazy if I lose power. researched this pump and bought it..took 20 minutes to hook up, man is this pump quiet and powerful. hooked it up to two deep cycle marine batteries and it works great off AC/ or Batteries ..not only got a good product but at the local lowes it retails for $670.00 with a 14 day wait cause its a special order....one day wait on amazon and I saved $170.00..will shop online for now on!!!"
1,My pump failed,"after 18 monthes, didn't flood but could have, had I not checked it out. Now can't find similar pump with different company. Paid alot for this pump, they dont make them anymore. That sucks"
1,Disappointed!,"If you are looking for a book that contains a bunch of logos along with a description of the meaning of each logo, then, this is what you are looking for.However, I still advise you to save your money. This one is very expensive compared to the content and what is there in the market.I wish if I didn't buy it!"
3,More of the same,"If you own the prequel to this book, you know exactly what to expect. It contains more of the same kinds of designs, in very similar styles, with additional commentary.My thoughts about this volume are pretty much the same as my thoughts about volume 1. It's OK, not great, but a fine resource to have on hand.I'm in the process of producing candidates for a possible redesign of our corporate logo. The logos in this book are a bit too colorful and casual for an organization of our size and nature. But I did find the designs to be artisticly pleasing. For me it is more of a general design resource than something that would help me with my particular goals.Having said that, the title of the book after all is ""Logo Design FOR SMALL BUSINESS."" Pay attention to that last part, and you may be pleased with what you get."
4,Sony VAIO battery,The battery was the correct one for my laptop and it works well. I just wish laptop batteries didn't have to be replaced after only a year. It's seem they stop holding the charge after a year or so.
4,great!!,I love this CD because I love Eric Benet' I great entertainer that does not get the recognition that he deserves
5,I Love this CD!!!,"When I was looking to add to my CD collection, a friend suggested this CD. I am so glad she did!!! This is a wonderful CD. Mr. Benet has a great voice and a sound that is all his own. He doesn't copy other artists. He truly stands on his own. This is a great addition to anyones CD collection and I highly recommend it."
4,El GED en ESpanol,"This book is an excelent tool for any teacher or student that need to improve, review or brush up on some of the grammar rules or mechanics of punctuations. It's a good buy."
2,EL GED en Espanol,"I purchased this book to help prepare a group of students for the GED at St. James in Mt. Rainier, Maryland. The book has many typographical as well as grammatical errors. The answer to some of the problems does not correlate well to the question asked. One student had a similar GED preparation from another publisher that basically contained the same material but with the typographical, grammatical and other errors corrected. I may have received an older (earlier) version of the text. I basically purchased the cheapest book for the class. A friend of mine likes to use this phrase: ""the cheapest thing is usually the most expensive""..."
3,Flash mask dirty,"Product was dusty and had black marks on the mask-otherwise, my son liked it. Seemed to have been on a shelf for long time."
5,Too much fun,"Okay, I've only had this drum for about an hour. And the instructional video hasn't even arrived yet (it was a later order). But this drum is just a blast to play. My ear isn't good enough to tell if it's in tune but I think it sounds just fine. Great tones all across the head and the rimshots are really bright.I'm 6' 2'' and the drum is comfortable to hold and play. I was nervous when I opened the box because it was just wrapped in a plastic bag. But the rugged build of the box and the robust build of the aluminum drum body and rings meant everything was fine. Looks like the rings are cast and then ground by hand so probably no two are alike.I'm confident this drum will give me many hours of pleasure. And at this price how could you go wrong?"
1,"After Virtue, After Thought",MacIntyre makes points in this book by trying to simply confuse the reader. There are too many leaps of faith for this to warrant further discussion.
5,But doesn't Nietzsche win?,"It's a breathtaking book, one of the best philosophy books that I've read. In chapter 9 ""Nietzsche or Aristotle?"" MacIntyre tries to prove that Aristotle wins. The problem is that MacIntyre needs to reinvent a Telos (ultimate end) to replace Aristotle's biological one, and on this he writes only one paragraph that is rather vague, ""the good life for man is the life spent in seeking for the good life of man, and the virtues necessary for seeking are those which enable us to understand what more than else the good life for man is. (p. 219)"" This does sound quite circular, and this ""good"" is never clearly defined.Sadly (I am not Nietzschean), I get the feeling that MacIntyre's challenge to topple Nietzsche doesn't completely succeed. His book then, perhaps, becomes another, extremely brilliant and contemporary (smashing utilitarianism and Kant), 'genealogy of morals.'"
1,Worst Self-Help Book Ever?,"This book must be one of the worst self-help books ever written. The author's talks about the himalayas and 'sages' sound so clichéd that everyone who has been there himself knows it's just a story.The conversations between the brother and the sister are hilarious sometimes. Imaginary example:J: 'Your children are really important, Catherine'C: 'That are powerful words, Julian, thanks for the wisdom!' said Catherine while tears filled her eyes.The author has five ideas that would make a nice brochure. The rest of the book is filled with quotes and a badly written, unbelievable story.Spend your money on something else."
2,HUGE,"This is a great watch in terms of features, but it is simply too big. Certainly not a women's watch and slightly too big for men as well...if you've got a big wrist, try it, but if not go for something smaller."
5,Fantastic,"Brilliant, beautiful, melodic pop rock. It's not the most original stuff you'll hear, or the most lyrically innovative, but there's something sincere and honest about the sound that elevates it above most bands. Jeff Martin's voice is awesome, flowing from laid back and mellow, to huge emotional surges, but never sounding whiny or strained. The piano is also used to good effect, adding touches of softness and beauty to the texture of the songs. ""Second Place Victory"" is a rediculously amazing song. Overall this CD is a great debut, full of easy to listen to, radio-friendly songs. Fans of Waking Ashland, Dashboard Confessional, Mae, and Something Corporate will love it. Everyone else will like it alot :)"
4,Another debut review,"'This Day & Age' is a group that will quickly develope fans and a following. I purchased this CD on whim and I am glad I did. This is Pop Rock with some Coldplay flavour mixed into the band. I loved the cover art of the album and think this is a nice clean almost flawless debut by this band. There are 13 songs on this CD and all the songs are great listening with beautiful guitar play mixed with bass and piano moments. The songs are touching and sung by the lead vocalist with a emotional vigour. The songs that stand out in this release are 'Sometimes' a nice melodical song but a tad too short, could of gone longer. 'Second Place Victory' a beautiful song almost sung in a rhapsody. Another nice song is 'The Day We Started' as well as 'Clouds & Skyscrapers'. I hope the band goes onto better and bigger things. Well done."
1,Do not buy from this seller....,Total rip off. They are only selling 1 roll for that price. Don't make the same mistake I did! I paid over $22 for what I thought was going to be (10) rolls. It has cost me $10 in shipping just to return. Lesson learned the hard way.
4,Good Book!,"Its dimensions are about 8.5 X 11.5 inches. It is about 1/3rd text, the rest pictures and a few cut-out illustrations showing the internal structure of a plane. The author was in the RAF, so there is some emphasis on British biplanes."
5,Everything I was looking for,"If you are like me and have always wondered what happened to these fascinating mammals, then get this is a book for you. It covers everything, but in a readable approach. I particularly like the way it introduces you to the tasmanian residents, new and old. Losing the tassie tiger was a great blow to conservation, but I still hear howls in the background of history."
3,don't let the title fool you.,"this is not a battle royale. it's a fight between eighteen and ""mighty mask"". but maybe it's just not my definition. Goku and Vegeta should be very proud that they're stronger than The S-kai. of course they don't know it yet. despite the fact that this is boring I'm glad that eighteen and ""Mighty Mask"" knocked the hoo-ha out of kilah and jewel, {yes, that's how you spell thier names} espaclly kilah! That guy talked WAY to fast and you couldn't understand a word he says. {and he thinks ""mighty mask"" is talkin' funny}"
3,Low point in the Babidi saga.,"This dvd is the most boring one in the Babidi saga in my opinion. Goku fights Yakan, then Goku, Gohan, Vegeta and Supreme Kai are waiting for Dabura the rest of the time. The world tournament moves along though. Great menu and music."
3,Not so fast before you hit that BUY button,"Really disappointed in this book. I was using RNotes, which is great for the student nurse. Lots of good basic helpful info for clinicals. I was looking to expand my reference base a bit more and go into a book that was available in PDA format. So I bought this ""All You'll Ever Need"" book. It certainly ISN'T all you ever need for clinicals. I am a graduating senior, so I'm still in the novice stage and need lots of good basic info and helpful stuff for work. This book may be fine for the more advanced nurse (I bought it based on a recommendation from an experienced home health nurse who said it was all he needed for his work), but man, its just missing too much of the basic stuff that I still need to look up and that I'm encountering in my clinicals. So save your money if you are a student. Buy the RNotes for a start. One of my profs also recommended the Portable RN as an excellent resource for the novice. But skip this book."
3,Not bad,"I am not overly impressed with the Plazas series. It is frustrating that they change the books only by names rather than content, confusing readers of different editions. For example, they would say, ""Yo soy Maria,..."" in one, and the same number, same exercise, diff edition, ""Yo soy Juan.."" Many feel this is just to make money and force you to get the new edition, rather than improve the book. So I give it 3 out of 5."
5,Love it!,I have this episode and it is very nice. It is from and inspired by when Jesus rose from the tomb. The voice actors are great and the art gorgeous. I love the colors too. I am an artist and let me tell you that they are able to get details drawn very nicely. And the hands look great! (Drawing hands is a huge weakness of mine.) Watching these episodes inspires me to use my gift of art for God to make my own animated stories about God for children and those young at heart like me to help bring them even closer to God. This is a wonderful series. A real joy. God Bless.
1,Inaccurate,"So many things that are Biblically inaccurate. I found even my children correcting these movies. My biggest concern was the way they showed Jesus carrying only wood~not the cross~which is the main message of the Bible. I prefer to only let my children watch things that line up with the Word of God, not to confuse them."
1,Awful old world animation - inaccurate information,Buy it if it makes you feel like you're educating your children but watch for inaccuracies and correct them so your children don't get wrong ideas. ...but don't expect them to watch it without being forced anyhow - terrible animation turns them off quickly and many of this companie's video's are so jumpy/bouncy that they leave you feeling physically ill after watching. Take your Dramamine!
1,Bad investment!!!,Class reunion stuff.Junk Don't waste your money on this like i did.Unless it not being the REAL songs of 1972 doesn't bother you.. (Not original) radio recordings.Not even live in concert.garbage.
2,A very local geology,"I can understand that the two five star reviewers are both residents of San Diego, because they're the only people this book is addressed to. The actual geological story is thin and fragmented. Amazingly there is almost no references to the plate techtonic events that created California. There are no maps to direct you to the sites the author describes, making them almost impossible for a visitor to find.If you (as I) don't live in or near San Diego, this book is, at best, mildly interesting."
2,JMez,"While I thought the cases provided a nice review of 60 IM scenarios that might be seen on the USMLE, the book is badly in need of an editor (notwithstanding that it is supposedly a ""Second Edition""). One case references an ECG that isn't there, a number of multiple choice questions are miskeyed, there is a reference to a previous ""Question 189"" which doesn't exist(probably meant 53-1), and typos such as ""pneumonics"" and ""omplications"" abound, among others. Additionally the self test questions all too frequently have the correct answer ""all of the above"", making it a poor simulation of the shelf or USMLE style of question. Again, the book isn't terrible, but with some serious editing (or perhaps reader input) it could be a whole lot better."
3,"Functional, but the material is cheap","I'm guessing it was made of some sort of cheap fiber, but it does help protect the Go board, and fits pretty well. Overall it's OK."
3,NOT A 15PK!,"I ordered this product because the title says ""15 pack"". However, there are only 12 per pack. I ordered them for my wedding and really needed the 24 or so doilies I was shorted. I requested that they send me the missing doilies ASAP, but they did not make it here before the wedding. They were decent quality, for the ones I did receive."
3,Not a Very Good Book,"In my opinion, the Greatest by Walter Dean Myers is not a very good book, it is acceptable. Myers covers a few but not all things about Ali. Myers writes about great fights, but not about how Ali went to Sonny Liston's house in Miami and called him out. Myers does cover some interesting points about how Ali beat George Foreman and Joe Frazier. I wanted Myers to write about more than how Ali just won fights. To make it a more interesting book, he should have wrote more about Ali's life struggles. Most of the time, Myers would keep me interested by writing about good fights. If you only want to read about Ali fighting and not his personal life, then you should read this book. However, I do not recommend it."
2,the book is small,The book is not that well written and documentedthe format is smallnot a lot of great picturesdisapointed
3,The Greatest Boxer Ever,"This summary is about a African American guy who want to be a professional boxer but, he need to fight with a lot of guys so he can have a shot for the champion ship. Also he need to trained a lot for the title so he can beat Frazier and all the professional boxers who has a lot of experience in street fight. They are very strong because they have a lot of time trained in street fight or something like that. So his coaches Joe push his self to a hard trained so he can beat the biggest professional boxers.I learn the book is about racism because he wants to be a champion but he is an African American so he fights with a lot guys. I think the theme is racism, but also at the sane time is adventure because he traveled a lot for the champion shot. I don't like to much this book because is to longer but I liked because in every story the good heroes win but this time wasn't like that this time the one of the bad guys win the title."
4,Good book for kids,"I bought this book for my fifth grader for a report he did on Ali. He enjoyed the book and pictures very much; to the point that he became quite interested in Ali's life (beyond just boxing). The boook was easy to read, not too long, and had some great, famous photographs."
3,The Greatest: Muhammad Ali,Muhammad Ali grew up as a young poor skinny kid. He had gotten a new bike for his birthday and it got stolen while he was at a trade show. From then on he wanted to box. He won an Olympic Gold Metal for Lightweight boxing and much more. This book takes you through all of Muhammad Ali's life in great detail.
3,Not the Best,"The Greatest Muhammad Ali written by ""Walter Dean Myers"" tells you about how it was for a black man to grow up in the racism and be successful. He did so well all over the world that he got respect from the white crowd. It tells you all the struggles he had while he was fighting and how he went from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali; also how he took it when he got Parkinson's disease. This man was a phenomenon in boxing and you learn that by reading this book. I would not buy the book but get it for a little while from the library."
2,Too Much,"Too much message, too little story. I couldn't even get through the first part of the book. The author did a good job on the characters, but when a character spends two pages obsessing about the nicknames a couple of guys call her, I'm starting to think she's a moron. Then there's the obsessive use of synonyms. Like it was a new word tool the author found and just had to use it. Pedantic? Really? I'm looking at my surrogate mother and THAT'S the word that comes to mind? I gave two stars because if ever I'm bored one day, I may think of these characters and curiousity may overcome me, and I just might finish this one. Of course, having the ""message"" completely overpower the story line, that probably won't happen. Come to think of it, the prologue was pretty off it's rocker as well. It starts with a treasure story. Then about fifteen pages into the book, you are where the prologue started. Why make it the prologue at all?"
2,None of the plot made sense,"I did not get the plot at all nor the reactions and feelings of the heroin. She starts by being almost willing to marry a man because he is a christian. Like why ? He's the only one left of Earth ? I hope not !Then she falls for this adventurer but instead of trusting God's power to change his heart, she immediately proceeds to reject him. Not a lot of faith there if you ask me...As for the adventure part : she gets kidnapped, almost killed, travels the desert (sometimes by foot) with this perfect stranger, all of this because of a amulet, a curse and buried treasure. The hero is like a bad penny. He always turns up even in the most unlikely situations.I appreciate that the christian message of putting your life in God's hands was the mission of the book. Fine. But at least, try to build a logical plot with believable characters."
3,You must suspend belief to enjoy this,"I got this free on my Kindle. It was my first read of a Catherine Palmer novel, this one being written in 1997. It is a swash-buckling adventure set in modern times like Indiana Jones-a mad rush to find the treasure and always pursued by those who want to reach it before the main characters. Packed with wild animals, and crazy rides, the reader is thrown into grand scenes on the African desert, the Niger River, Timbuktu, and all kinds of intrigue. That's where you must suspend belief-it is impossible for that many things to happen to two people in that short of an amount of time and then have everything come out right in the end. But, if you can enter the world of fantasy for this book, you will probably enjoy it. I particularly liked the true historical basis on which this story was set. The author spent a lot of time researching this as evidenced by her bibliography at the back of the book. That part fascinated me."
4,not the most memorable book but good,"I read this book several months ago on my Kindle. Just now, in order to review it, I had to go back and re-read a small portion to spark my memory. Not to say I didn't like the book, because I did enjoy the adventurous side of the story, but it obviously wasn't memorable enough for me that the title alone evoked memories of the story."
2,Too much religious stuff,The depiction about an adventure in African is good. But there's too much religious stuff. It's all right to have Bible quotes. Many books do. But Bible quotes or preachy or prayer on almost every page are way too much.
3,"Good Story, Too Preachy","I really loved the story line of this book. The suspense, romance, and general plot were very interesting to me, and well-written. But the constant scripture-quoting was hard to read. I read a lot of Christian books like this. I like the clean romance, which was done really well in A Kiss of Adventure. I always skip over the preachy bits, but here it was on every page and interfered with my enjoyment of an otherwise excellent story."
2,Not quite what was expected,"The description of the book was somewhat misleading. The heroine comes off as childish and indecisive, yet she wants adventure and not settle for the ordinary. Frankly, it grew tiresome with her on again, off again feelings for Graeme and the situation. There were parts that seem to want to take off but got bogged down with her always asking God what should she do. I thought it was a little over done in that respect. God helps those who help themselves and show some common sense for goodness sakes!"
5,Loved it!,"Adventure with a capital letter! This really was a fun read.....did I mention adventure? It seems that the phrase ""out of the frying pan into the fire"" describes this book from cover to cover. Catherine really is an excellent writer and this is a must read. Enjoy!"
3,My favorite bands worse album,"If you are buying this, let it be known that I would expect you to be a complete-ist collector. Most likely you are interested in the guests, namely Beck and Mike Patton. Patton turns in a song dominated by noise/ambiance/experimentation and NO Peeping Tom style beats or anything like that. In addition to this, the Beck song is the same one featured on Beck's Guerolito, but it is a good song if you don't have that album. All in all the best part of this product is the DVD, which is certainly not to be overloked, because despite the fact that it only has a tiny handful of videos, they are quite developed and amazing in their own right. This is not a bad album, but I expect a lot from my favorite group. I prefer A New White or Yell&Ice...or better yet: 13&God."
3,A lil flimsy,"I typed in the search ""Gray heavy weight file folders letter size"" - my fault for not paying attention to the description that said these were legal size. I would have just returned and exchanged for the letter size, but folders themselves are definitely not ""heavy-weight"". If you are needing these to last, I would recommend a different brand. xoxo"
4,Out of box impression is good,"Out of the box the wrench seemed pretty good. I checked the wrench with a calibrated load cell to check the torque settings on the wrench. All my settings were about 1-3 Ft-lbs low (checked it from 10-150 ft-lbs at 10ft-lb intervals), not bad for the cost of the wrench. I think this will serve my purpose of light duty work on my personal vehicles with no complaints. Note that at low torque ranges the click is not very audible so just pay close attention on low torque settings."
2,Buying CD's without listening first!,"The song I really wanted was on this CD, or so I thought, since it had the same name and singer. After purchasing it I discovered it was a different version and not usuable at all. Wish there was a way to listen to CD's before purchasing. Feel like I wasted my money."
5,Great Music by Terrific Artists,"Putumayo CDs rarely disappoint, and this one surely does not. Those familiar with Middle Eastern artists will be pleased to hear tracks from Faudel, Amr Diab, Khaled and Cheb Mami. Those *not* familiar with them are in for a treat. North African Groove features musicians from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya. You will also hear cross-cultural influences, with some of the songs having a Latin influence, or French. Simply stated, this is good music, great for dancing at a party or just to enjoy. Some are even of interest to belly dancers; I've seen Amina's track, ""Dis-Moi Pourquoi"" performed by a dance troupe. Do yourself a favor, get this CD, introduce it to your friends, and turn the world on to what great music the Middle East has to offer. (As an added benefit, a portion of the proceeds will be donated by Putumayo to Search for Common Ground.)"
5,Keen insight into manned spaceflight,"The updated edition of The All American Boys begins with Walt Cunningham's experiences as an Apollo astronaut in the 1960s and ends with his shrewd analysis of today's manned space program -- and where we need to go from here.Cunningham's unvarnished look behind the scenes at NASA during its heyday is informative and entertaining, but the chapter on the development of the International Space Station and our relationship with the Russians should be required reading for anyone with an interest in manned spaceflight.I highly recommend this book!"
5,The Astronaut Tell-All,"Apollo 7 astronaut Walt Cunningham's book is probably the most candid book about the early astronauts. Cunningham seems to have felt like he was among the astronauts, rather than one of them. He seems awed by the celebrity status conferred on ordinary men like himself, and seeks to dispel the myth of astronaut as hero. He is very blunt, but also entertaining. I don't care about the technical side of the space race, I enjoy reading about the human side, and Cunningham's story is very human. A book any well-read space buff must see. It's hard to find even in libraries, so if you're lucky enough to get a copy, keep it, or e-mail me"
5,Cunningham has The Right Stuff.......,"The crew of Apollo 7 earned the respect of the entire nation for taking the first flight after the tragic Apollo 1 fire. As I learn more about Mr. Cunningham, I am even more impressed. The All American Boys is part autobiography and part analysis of NASA past and present. It is not a detailed flight by flight chronology. Instead, it provides an authoritative perspective that cuts through the clutter and sanitized version we often get. To his credit, Mr. Cunningham communicates in a thoughtful manner without taking cheap shots at his former colleagues.On a personal note, Mr. Cunningham responded to an autograph request within 7 days (small fee - check his website for details). This helped cement my respect for Mr. Cunningham. You will enjoy this book.Mike Hill"
4,Interesting Perspective during the Glory days of Apollo,"This is an interesting and enjoyable book. Of the many space / NASA related books I have read, this one ranks near the top. Walter Cunningham's point of view from his acceptance as an astronaut through his career with NASA is quite interesting, with new details and fresh perspectives of that great, adventurous period in our countries history. The revised edition gets a much needed update but also Cunningham becomes a little more preachy, inflicting his critical views on the current (2003) state of NASA and in the direction that should be taken in future of manned space exploration. I would have been very interested in Cunningham's career and what he has done since retiring from NASA in the early 1970's, but there is little here that details what he has been doing the last 30 years. Perhaps in the next revised edition some biographical details can be included along with Mr. Cunningham's views."
3,Methods in Behavioral Reserach with PowerWeb,"I thought the content was going to help me understand better the hard copy version and test me on the information. It did explain some things better, but it didn't test me on the hard cover book. So, there's really no point in buying this one if you have the hardcover. Oh well."
3,It's ok,"They give you enough line for the repair, but it's a bit expensive for what you get. The delivery was slow. The filter worked all right, but it was a bit of a pain to install"
3,"seems like quality stuff, but not much fuel line","Just enough fuel line to do the fix, on sears craftsman weed-eater. It has three sizes of line, so is probably a more or less universal kit. The filter was much smaller than the original but seems like it would have worked. Sadly the fix was a complete failure due to other unrelated issues with the carb, however I was able to install this kit without any difficulties. I found a video on you-tube that helped with the repair. I had to use a utility knife to remove the old fuel lines from the copper nipples on the carb. With a little care I found I could slice almost all the way through and then tear them the rest of the way, to prevent scratching the copper. The only other tricky bit was stuffing the lines through the holes in the fuel tank. It just took patience and a lot of wrist action."
2,"Independent movie, poor picture, good plot, tiring","The movie opens with the director explaining her motives for making it.She identifies with the situation and characters. She is a first time diretor and First Rites views it as brilliant. I found it to be a dragwith poor cinemetography. Four ladies--each a bit of an oddball, down on their luck--try to find work. Somehow a male friend convinces them to start answering phone calls from people placing bets, using their kitchen.They know nothing about betting but try to make some money. The director decided to make the film a bit alluring so breasts of them in steamy showers are shown. The love lives of two are revealed. At the beginning, one's mother dies. They can't afford a funeral so take the casket onto a subway to get to the cemetary. Sound oddball. Yes. I'll give this film to anyone to asks: VHS version."
5,MATRI --Letters from the Mother,"I found ""Matri"" to be a gentle but profound and poetic guide for women and men on a spiritual path. Zoe Ann Nicholson draws upon the wisdom of saints and seekers from many cultures, many times, and suggests a practice by which today's women and men might weave a new and unique tapestry of harmony and balance from today's chaotic and fragmented energies.""Matri"" points out that we need look no further than our own heart to courageously participate with all of creation in sourcing a harmonious world. I highly recommend this little book. It is indeed inspired."
4,The Four Agreements Especially for Women,"For women who have been inspired by ""The Four Agreements"" by Don Miguel Ruiz, this concise work provides a blueprint that is soothing and empowering. Zoe Nicholson has written a poetic piece that speaks from the heart to help all women find their spirtual center."
2,highway 61 missing?!,why is nobody mentionign the fact that they left off johnny cash's cover of 'highway 61 revisited'? there's no reason why that song should be unavailable and they just ommited it from the soundtrack but they included 'the man comes around'. it makes no sense.
3,"It's still Vic, but not his best work","I love the old stuff by Victor and his live solo shows, but this albums lacks any kind of raw feel or even that many good songs to make this one worthwhile. Check out his earlier stuff first."
3,A bit disappointing.,"I have only recently become a Victor Wooten fan. After hearing his unique style, I purchased his first two CDs and loved them! I could not wait to get hold of the Yin/Yang CD. But, after going threw both CDs I was disappointed, especially with the Yang CD which is all vocal. I expected more bass solos as with his earlier albums. Also, to have Booty Collins on your album and not allow him to ""Get Loose"" with the funky style that made him great was a waste. A Bootsy/Wooten bass duel would have been simply awesome."
4,Yin is world class....Yang stinks,"Just bought Yin/Yang last week. Popped in Yin and was amazed. Every track is great. I'm thinking that this CD is 20 times better than ""What Did He Say"". Listened to Yin 3 times, then put in Yang. Major disappointment. Vic, please stick to the instrumentals. Fortunately, the vocals are confined to a separate CD which will never see the light of day in my player again. In spite of all, Vic is still the best bass player in the world, and I still love his message."
3,the wuss element creeps in,"Victor can still bring the funk, but about 1/4 of the tracks are boring, anonymous cooljazz. These tracks conspicuously feature the ""Fabulous"" Wooten brothers, which if you have those CDs, you know what I mean.His first album was drop-dead unbelievable, and his second was also pretty awesome. This, like 90% of double albums, has about enough good material for one album.Well, maybe I will get my CD-R and make just that CD for myself. The stuff that's good is sometimes very, very good."
2,so/so,i didn't really feel this one.Victor Wooten is talented but he doesn't shine on these two discs.and the wasted song with Bootsy? if you get the Genius of Bootsy Collins on your record you gotta play it to the fullest.this set should have been one disc.way too many folks are coming out with multi-sets.
5,FREAKIN AMAZING,"If you are looking for an innovative album from one of the best bass players around this is it. With a ton more variety than ""A Show of Hands"" Vic puts down some of the smoothest grooves imaginable. This guy has new ideas coming out of his...you get the picture! I thought ""A Show of Hands"" was cool, but Yin Yang is definatly different. And JD Blair, where'd this guy come from? Drums in Stereo on ""Hip Bop""!!??!! Look out for this guy in the future!! The only downside to this album to me at least is the fact that there aren't 3 more cds to go along with it!! GET IT!!!"
2,"Best bass player ever, But can't get a groove on this one","As a huge fan of the Flecktones, I was excited as ever when this album came out. I love the increadible licks and speed that Victor makes seem so easy when you see him live. I didn't know a bass could be played as well as he played when I first heard him. Thats why I bought this album. His other solo albums are great, but ""Yin Yang"", I listened to it twice, and hid it away for ever. If your looking for the funky sound of the Flecktones, check out ""Live Art,"" this isn't worth your money. I was only disappointed when I heard it. It's clear his talent is there but the music didn't fit my taste. He even trys to dub his daughter's voice into a song to making it sound like she raps. It was one of the most disturbing songs I have ever heard. With no disrespect to Vic, this album is just a bummer."
2,Wasted Space,"As a bassist, I purchased this album as a ""must-buy"" especially after Victor's outstanding ""Show of Hands"" CD. On a few cuts, the excellent musicianship continues but other tracks that highlight a child's ""rap"" and random squeals make much of the CD unlistenable. I suggest Victor drop the self-indulgence and get back to the solid, fabulous funk and awesome technique he's known for."
2,Vic still rules,"I love victor wooten but this album kinda .... Vic fans can get ... but not one of them will disagree that he sounds 10 million times better live or with Bela Fleck and the Fleck tones. If you want a great album of vic listen to Bela fleck and the flecktones ""Live Art"" or get one of his other solo albums i.e.,""what did he say"", ""A show of Hands"" Sorry vic, I still love ya man."
2,"Bass - impressive. Vocals - well, please stick to bass.","This was the first Victor Wooten CD I bought, and was very dissapointed. I was hoping for up-beat slap/funk. This is a very mellow cd set with one upbeat song. I don't like ballads at all, and Victor seems to love them. I'd rather not talk about the ""yang"" cd. The vocals make it intolerable. I havn't listened to the yang cd once through yet. I've owned the cd's for three months. If you want to see victor at his jaw dropping best, buy his ""Live at Bass Days '98"" video. he is umquestionably talented, but these cd's don't bring that out much."
5,Go Wooten,"I own his 2 other previous releases and I think that they are outstanding, I read the reviews other people wrote, some of them say that this is a bad album, I disagree for the fact that his first 2 albums were filled with bass solos and what not, this is sort of a change for Wooten, but non the less I think he wanted to change this album, to show that he doesn't have to play fast, to be good, even though his chops are phenominal."
5,Masterpiece Color Nudes,"This is the book that established Uwe Ommer as a master of the nude in color. The photos are fantastically lit with a beautiful natural romantic lighting that yields deeply saturated colors, yet fantastically beautiful skin tones. It is rare to see such beautiful skin tones in photos!The images are at the same time very erotic and very tasteful. The women are just gorgeous, and the naturalness of their poses and expressions draws the viewer in to the photos.If you appriciate nudes this is a must have. If you are bored by the typical color nudes you see in the mass media, such as Playboy, you will probably find this book refreshing.If you appriciate the beauty of black women and long for images that show extreamly attractive exotic black women, you will enjoy this book.If you do not appricate the beauty of black women, you may completely change your mind after looking through this book."
5,AN AFRIPHILE'S PARADISE. . .,"Uwe Ommer's Black Ladies is an elegant collection of African and African diaspora women(at least, there is one photo of supermodel, Roshumba Russell) which represents an aesthetic salute to black beauty that U.S. culture seems unable to produce.Ommer published an earlier version of BL in the 1980s, and his book was featured in a 1986 edition of Zoom, the photography magazine. This new version is apparently not identical to the 1980s version, but it is equally rich. Ummer's African women are natural beauties wrapped-and-then-unwrapped quite wonderfully in an African context, reflecting the photographer's obvious passion for Africa. Those who share his vision will agree that the beauty of African women, far from being the secondary aesthetic as it is portrayed in the U.S.A., is second to none."
3,what good hype can do,"Solid amateur photography intelligently marketed, proof that a well designed package can sell well. Does it then really matter if the ""Black Ladies"" book is slightly better than ""Asian Ladies""? Both books aren't worth the money in my opinion but of course others might think different."
3,Lacks a creative edge,"This collection was a bit disappointing in that the photos were so tame and somewhat on the boring side! It was no surprise to see black bodies in ""respectable"" positions because I think there's this crazy need out there to always present black women as ""queens"". This bunk is exactly what this book delivers.For me, this would have been an interesting book if it had shown the eroticism of black women and the variety of sexuality that exists in black women. Also, it was tiresome to see only tall, muscled, skinny black women held up as icons of beauty and sexuality. Where are the pictures of heavy women? Women who love S&M;? Lesbians? Well, they're not found in this book!Yes, the photos are nice, blah, blah...but, there's nothing else creative or interesting about them."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"This is different to the boring Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Black Sabbath imitation I was expecting. This is a more authentic classic hard rock style, like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd's poppy upbeat stuff. I don't like this kind of music, but if you're looking for an authentic sounding retro rock band that doesn't reduce old-school rock to it's most basic elements, like The Strokes, The Hives, and The White Stripes do, then this is the band you've been looking for."
4,The Treasure Trap,"Billy Beak and Angel Wilson had just met, Angel moved in Mr. Watermelon's old house and he was very mean. He was also very rich. One day he disappeared. Angel wanted to find the treasure because she wanted to be a treasure hunter like her dad. They found a map and got the whole neighbor hood to dig up her back yard but didn't find anything. They interviewed everyone in town that knew Mr. Watermelon and got a whole bunch of clues. They found out that Mr. Watermelon cashed 1 million dollars from the bank and had has money underground with him. Mrs. Jenkins was not nice and she knew a lot about Mr. Watermelon but she was very mean. She had a bridge party and angel made ant chocolate chocolates. She found out and was very mad. They found out he dun an airtight hole in the ground and they were trying to find it and got trapped in it."
3,Beware the PAL format!,"Be careful if ordering this in the U.S. - it is in the PAL DVD format that isn't compatible with standard players on this side of the pond. It will play; however, you only get a portion of the picture and it is in black and white. (And it's interesting navigating the DVD menu when you cannot see the options on the screen!) It was a very nice movie otherwise, and I sure wish I could buy it in a format I could actually watch."
1,Disappointed and Frustrated,"My husband is a huge fan of Alf Wight (a.k.a. James Herriot) but the DVD could not be played on our US DVD player. We had this same problem when we purchased a DVD when we were in England. Luckily they send us a replacement DVD that could be played on out US DVD player. I was disappointed fora couple of reasons: 1.) it was not listed as a UK only DVD, 2). now I have the hassle of trying to send this back to get my money back."
4,Not exactly what I expected,"I thought there would be an interview with the author. There wasn't. Mostly just a look at some beautiful scenery. Very little insight into the ""story behind the story"". All that said, we enjoyed it anyway."
3,"US viewers, beware","This is a PAL-format DVD. I even had initial issues viewing it on my region-free player. That said, if you wondered what Herriot's Yorkshire looked like in the 90's, here your chance. I'd also suggest the 70's tome ""James Herriot's Yorkshire"" with photos by Derry Brabbs as a accompaniment."
3,confusing,This game looks like it could be a lot of fun. However the directions are complicated and I am not able to explain the rules to be able to play. I am considering calling the manufacturer for the directions. Good luck with this one.
3,all the pretty light 1,to whom it may concern i thought more songs would come with the music cd also the case the music came in was broken .
3,"""ok""","You know this cd is ok all the songs I have herd so nothing new its like ""the bets of sould ballet"" because there is no new song, Don't bother."
1,Broke in a month,"I bought 2 bands, the purple and the red bands on Jan 3rd and by Feb 22nd they have both broken. Don't buy them because they are not worth the money. Very cheaply made."
2,A brief 112 page overview of Kung Fu,"A very brief overview of the ""Kung Fu Way of Life"". It is useful as a very basic beginning to understanding Kung Fu. The Horse Stance shown on page 39 looks too wide for comfort. Most other texts on the subject recommend a horse stance ""slightly wider than shoulder width."" I don't recommend not reading this book, but I prefer David Chow's ""Kung Fu"" and Dr. Jwing-Ming's ""Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu"". Personally, I'm a student of Ed Parker's Kenpo Karate, which is derived from the ancient Martial Art of Kung Fu. This is a great way to buy books!"
4,Makeup Galore,I love this makeup case. It holds all of my makeup. The only down side is that when opened it has to be propped against something or it will turn over.
2,"More B2B, Less DOD","As mentioned in another review, this book is very heavily oriented toward the government sector. The basic concepts of course apply to B2B suppliers as well, but it is difficult and frustrating to constantly have to stretch to relate the concepts and techniques to the private sector. My biggest complaint is the author's constant use of abbreviations and acronyms. I found myself having to keep a running glossary of his terms (MTBF, EPR, LSC, to mention a few) just to understand what he was talking about. In general, it is a good book for gaining a basic understanding of supplier warranties, but don't expect it to give you a lot of insight into developing your own."
2,horrible reception,"This phone is cheap, and you get what you pay for. Their range is very limited, and I get an awful lot of ""clicking"" static unless i'm right by the base. I have tried the based in several areas with the same result. They just don't work well."
2,Super-negative... Do you really want your kid to read this one?,"The first half of this book is a prolonged, super-negative anti-baby tirade. Sure, we as adults can see the reality behind Shirley's jealous rants, but can most small children, who are theoretically the target audience here? I think this book indulges in dark, negative emotions, and the resolution is dramatically weak, so the message is unlikely to get through to the kids who need it. I would NOT recommend this book as a tool to work through sibling rivalries."
4,A fun book from a promising new author,"The success of Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code has revealed the presence of a rich vein of material buried in the fringes of Christian history and belief. Now others seem to be looking to mine this material as well. Dourado is David Wood's first book, and overall it is a pretty good effort. The main characters are just quirky enough to be interesting, and the premise is intriguing. There is sufficient action to keep the story moving, and the ending isn't telegraphed too early in the story. While this doesn't have the depth of detail or the extremely intense pacing that is found in The DaVinci Code, this book was very easy to read, and provided an interesting new twist on the source of our biblical stories. This is a great first effort, which hopefully will be followed up by even better works."
4,Fascinating Exciting Read,Dourado was a fascinating read. Fast paced. Good character development. Enjoyable with an interesting twist. Highly recommended. I found it exhilerating and so I didn't put it down for long.
2,Couldn't finish,"I bought this book based on the good reviews it received. I wasted my time and money. The primise is good, which is what convinced me to buy the book. Boy was I disappointed (and a little ticked). I hate to write a negative review, because I know how hard it is to write a book. But this should have been marketed to 12 year old boys, not adults."
2,Too many typos to ignore,"It's one thing to watch a B move and another to read it, particularly when there are so many errors (typos) that jar one out of the story and back to the reality of reading a poorly edited book. These are not always misspellings, but the wrong words that pass spell checkers but make no sense in context. This could have been a better read but for the fact that no editor did."
4,A Good Read for those enjoying action novels ala Dirk Pitt a,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who knew that I've read a number of Clive Cussler action adventures among others. I found Dourado to be quite reminiscent of the type of adventures chronicled by Cussler and other good adventure genre authors.The plot does an about face about 1/2-way through to change direction, and the action starts right away and doesn't abate until the end.This book would be a great way to spend a long afternoon or a short weekend."
4,I Enjoyed This Book,I'll give an book five stars if I finish it and was satisfied with the cost.This was the second David Wood book that I have read. The first was Quest. I enjoyed them both.
4,Dourado,"Good book, same theme as the other church books, but with a slight twist in the endings. Not quite as strong of a story, but still worth reading."
3,Entertaining,"I found the book entertaining and fast paced. It never ran dull because the action kept flowing. I liked how the author used enough detail that you are able to visualize the person or scene in your head without endless droning - Ex. ""The God Machine"". If you are a fan of Indiana Jones, then you will enjoy this. I did give it three stars because some parts were a bit thin and the main discovery was unearthed rather simplistically. Also, NAVY SEALs are crazy smart and the main character sometimes didn't seem so. Overall it kept my interest and I intend on reading his other book ""Cibola"""
3,NOT Clive Cussler,"This was a fun book to read. Obviously an attempt at matching Clive Cussler. Not quite, but good try. Also, it's poorly edited. There were grammar errors, etc. polluting the text. The ending was silly, fantastic, and unsatisfying - there was lots of confusion about the layout of the setting there as well."
4,Great mystery and action,I really enjoyed the Dane Maddock adventures and the only improvement I can think of is the series is a little confusing as to which came first.
4,A Decent Read,"A decent, but not great thriller that weaves Biblical legend and alien visitation theories together nicely. One reviewer compared this novel to Clive Culler's Dirk Pit series, and I agree that the two are similar, so Dirk Pit fans will enjoy Duraudo."
3,Too Far Fetched,"I'm all for the far fetched - no way that's even possible - kind of novel...as long as it's at least intelligently written. This wasn't one of those books. It started out very intriguing and I couldn't wait to read more, then the heros make a crazy inference and things just fall into place. Totally not believable."
2,Dim and Cheap,"ALthough I admit that I have just taken it out of the box, I know my deer will laugh. This thing uses 2 dollar store LED lights that do not light up a closet. I can only get 1 radio station to come in on the ""one"" button tuning system. The on-off switch is inside and there is no way to turn it off to work in the garden. It will continue all day long. Not sure how people are faving success. I have a large garden with a serious deer problem. I just ordered the Scarecrow. I think this thing would do best as a closet radio light for when you are looking for another shirt. But bring a flashlight to help with your search. Disappointed that these guys took a great idea to China and allowed the lowest bidder to manufacture it to maximize profit. That will come back to bite them.Pros:The mount is good. The product Box was nice."
1,deer chaser,"Product is very sensitive.If the wind blows it sets it off.I have it set for 7 seconds so at least it isn't killing the batteries.The light isn't very bright even in pitch black.There is no alarm only a radio that comes on.It does come on when I get within 10 feet of it but I doubt that it will scare a deer away.I have the area tied with fishing line,so the deer will have to break that first in order to set it off.Bottom line,I wouldn't buy it after seeing it work."
2,inadequate to work for long,"I purchased four of the P7840 to scare away deer from entering my yard and destroying my fruit trees and garden. The P7840 accomplished that goal for maybe two weeks after which point the deer appeared to have become tolerant to the deterrent, and went about eating my fruit trees and garden notwithstanding the noise and the light. The batteries wore out much more quickly with the deer constantly tripping the alarms, and rain water filled up the motion sensor cavity. So not only did the P7840 not deter the deer long-term, the P7840 also seems to be ill-designed for long-term outdoor use."
2,NEEDS IMPROVEMENT,"PRODUCT NEEDS TO HAVE A ""NIGHT"" FEATURE. DEER ARE MOSTLY NOCTURNAL. THE CHASER SEEMS TO GO OFF CONSTANTLY IN THE DAY WITH NO MOVEMENT AND SET AT LOWEST SENSITIVITY. SHOULD BE RE-TOOLED TO USE A DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER RATHER THAN A RADIO. PRODUCT IS LARGER THAN EXPECTED. SEEMS TO BE A GOOD IDEA BUT COULD BE VASTLY IMPROVED WITH A FEW CHANGES.BOUGHT TWO OF THEM AND BOTH RESPOND THE SAME."
2,Sensitive,"Nice sensitivity to movement, but the deer get used to it and it stopped working in about a month. Stills works to sense movement."
1,Does Not Work!,"The Deer Chaser scared off the deer for about a week, after which they were no longer afraid of it. My roses are as chewed up as ever. Do not buy this product!"
2,"Not very effective, and didn't last very long.","I bought 4 different deer-scaring devices (two different solar-powered electronic devices, this one, and a motion-detecting water spraying one) to see which of them was most effective. I used them in different areas at different times, and moved them around, to see which worked the best. This one came in tied...for last. It wasn't really very effective at keeping out the deer (none of them really were), and it only lasted for a couple of months, after which time it simply quit working. Best defense? A 7-ft fence."
5,works like it says,We live in a rural area & there are lots of deer that roam around. Normallyit wasn't a problem until we decided to plant some flowers & bushes belowon the hill behind our house. The deer thought it was Home Town Buffet!We put 2 deer chasers on each side of the yard & now when they walk bythey give our yard a wide berth. Our neighbor was so impressed that he askedif we could get one for him as they jump over his fence & eat all his flowers.This product really works and we recommend it!!
1,Coon chaser this is not,"I purchased this device to chase racoons that have been tearing up our lawn while looking for grubs. It apparently ""sees"" them, turns the light and radio on, but does not phase them. So, it does not work for my purposes."
1,Deer Radio,To start I don't feel everything about the device was described thoroughly on the website before I purchased the device. I put one of them up the day I received my order and tuned the FM frequency to an National Public Radio station in the area for talk radio as was recommended(that's right folks it is a radio hooked up to a motion sensor and has a light too). I heard the device go off at night (it woke me up) and the next morning the plants I was trying to protect with the device had been chewed on. Same the next night until the weather made them bed down. Save the money.
3,Dear Chaser NOT Too Effective,"The Deer Chaser product perfoms functionally per specification but is NOT effective at keeping the deer away from my flower beds and vegetable gardens as promoted. The light turns on and off when a motion is detected within the 25ft range and the radio works well on some of the 5 units that I purchased. A couple of them may be defective since the radio does not perform consistently in the same area where others work. Like other advertised product to keep deer from destroying landscape and garden, the Deer Chaser product does NOT deliver as promoted."
2,don't work good,"I have 2 of these and they do not perform well. The radio station keeps going out, the light does not always work and if it is windy out; they go off all the time. They do not scare anything off."
2,insufficient controls,There is no way to switch this off without disassembly. If protecting a garden in daily use then the unit is always on while the protection needed by me is at night. The addition of an off on switch would make this a good unit but without it it can only service areas not in use.
5,"High Quality DVD Transfer; Great Movie, too!","I've been looking for this movie for years, ever since I lost the VHS copy I taped off-the-air in 1979.I was hesitant to purchase it because of the bad reviews of its quality, but when the cover art changed, I figured that the manufacturing process and/or manufacturer may have also changed, so I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did; the video is crisp and sharp, and the audio perfectly clear. There were no artifacts of any kind to detract from the content.It would have been nice to have some special features, though. There are no menus - when the movie is over, the DVD just loops back and starts again from the beginning (makes it very easy to watch it twice in a row. *:^)Highly recommennded."
5,A great gothic romance,This movie is great fun - I remember it when it was first on TV decades ago. Featuring Lindsay Wagner - the Bionic Woman - and a very young Linda Gray of TV's Dallas. A romantic guilty pleasure with beautiful costuming and Victorian scenery.
5,Fantastic escapism,I love this movie – always have. I have an old VHS recorded off the TV from years ago but I would adore a DVD of this great film. I was really chuffed when Somewhere in Time came out on DVD – hopefully the powers that be will consider doing the same for this film.Just because it’s a TV movie doesn’t make it any less wonderful in my opinion. Here’s hoping…
1,Don't bother getting this movie,"I was suckered in by some of the amazon reviews, but this movie oozes old, poor acting. Don't even think about even renting this movie, if people still do that."
5,Movie,"I saw this movie years ago, and enjoyed it so much, I wanted a copy of it. It is just a movie I liked and will watch more than once."
5,Fantastic movie,This tele movie is one of the first time travel movies I have ever seen and throughly enjoyed it very much
5,an old favorite,"I first saw this as a TV-movie on Halloween years ago and was really taken by it. Of course, I was ten at the time, but even at thirty-five, I still really like this somewhat cornball but wonderfully spooky and heartfelt time-travel romance. Lindsay Wagner was great as the heroine who discovers a dress that magically drags her back into the past. I really liked the theme of sad people finding each other and bringing comfort to each other through new love, as well as the time-travel theme. Highly recommended."
5,if you love romance watch this,"I first watched this film many years ago, and have spent the last few years trying to find it on video. I have always remembered it. If you like romantic films with a touch of fantasy, mixed with period drama and modern living, then you'll love this film."
4,Just as I remember...,I saw this on tv many years ago and loved it.....if you like stories of traveling back into time....you will love this!
4,Great movie - The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan,"Really great movie. It came out years ago. Great plot but the acting is a little lacking and it moves a little slow at times. Overall, still one of my favorite movies. Definately worth seeing!"
4,The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan,The supplier of this product was very diligent in getting this item to me and kept emailing me to make sure I received it. I would do business with her again.
1,The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan,Sucks coz will not play correctly on DVD Recoder machine. Only plays black but could hear sound. Box says for standard DVD player only. I may have to watch it only on the laptop if that even works.
5,Better than I thought,I was hesitant to buy this. It is an old movie and I wasn't sure what the quality would be like. But Amazon did a wonderful job on it. It was a present for my sister because she just loves Lindsay Wagner. She was very happy with it and watched it at least six times already. The only downside is that you have to watch it on a dvd player. She only has a computer so I let her watch it on my portable player. Worked great.
5,Two Worlds of Jenny Logan,"This is a beautiful love story set in the present and the romantic past. Lindsay Wagner's present day marriage is on the rocks due to husbands infidelity. She finds a victorian dress in her attic, which she lovingly restores to its former beauty. When she tries it on she suddenly is transported back in time to when a handsome young man owns her house. Of course there is another woman who wants him, played by Linda Gray of Dallas. It's an intriguing and beautiful love story. You just hope she gets to stay with her new love in his time."
5,Recommend this movie,"This movie touches on so much - love, life, and happiness. Jennie Logan is a woman torn between time and love, and makes a decision based on her feelings. I highly recommend this movie - it would be a great show to watch with a couple of friends."
4,Soundtrack,"The music from this movie has haunted me for years. A good time travel story, not quite as good as Somewhere in Time, but still worth the watch. Have a VHS copy taped from television, have not ever been able to make myself toss it. I have added this to my Christmas list :)"
5,Reproducing Mahler,"As several reviewers implied, this performance of #7 does not get into the composer's head. No performance can do that! However, it does capture a less angst-ridden 7th. than is usually the case. This gives the music a chance to breath and lets us hear the musical infrastructure of the symphony. It may not be the ""echt"" performance of the 7th., but musically it is acurate and therefore, a valid interpretation-by the way, this is not MTT's first recorded Mahler, there is a version recorded in his years with the LSO that is as angst-ridden as anyone would like.I would add that no conductor gets into Mahler's head, not even Walter and Klemperer. We interpret what we hear/read in the score and try to approximate it-this is why it is called music-making."
4,"Not one of his best, but worth getting anyway","For me this album was worth getting for the instrumental 'Andy's Bad'. There aren't any bad tracks here, but the slide guitar on 'Andy's Bad' is played with such feeling and emotion it almost sounds like he's speaking to the listener. It's a poignant track, although I'm sure he didn't know he'd be dead within a year."
3,NOT THE BRENDA JACKSON I WAS LOOKING FOR!,This book is not by Brenda Jackson the romance author with the Madaris series. I was disappointed and felt misled.
3,exactly what i needed...but,"This is the exact replacement part I needed for my craftsman lawn tractor. It is fine and the installation was pretty easy. My only concern is that it is poorly designed in the first place. Seeing that the long ""arm"" of this is hollow, it will likely break off again in time like the original one did since it has to lift the entire mower deck. It's not cheap either, but for now, it will do the trick until I can sell the tractor."
3,Quality between the same product differs,I ordered four of these necklaces as gifts for my bridesmaids. Two of the four necklaces were as described. However the other two had to be exchanged because the pearls were misshapen and had very noticeable blemishes. After describing the problem the necklaces were exchanged and I was satisfied with the purchase.
3,Peal Necklace,"The pearl setting is very nice and elegant. However, I am a little dissapointed in the chain, it doesn't do the pearl justice. I was very excited that this came in a 20"" length, so I was unpleasantly surprised that is wasn't a ""true"" 20 inches. It came with an extender on it, that in no way matches the necklace. They should have stated that in the description....Very misleading!"
3,"Beautiful Pearl, Poor Chain","I got this pearl for my sister as a Christmas gift. She was very excited about having a single pearl necklace. Like other customers I was disappointed to see that there was an extender piece on the chain. To top things off this is a very cheap chain. After trying on the necklace the clasp broke while it was still around her neck. I was not impressed. If you do get this necklace, be prepared to invest in a better chain."
4,Good gift for bridesmaids,"I got these as bridesmaids' gifts and they were a big hit. They looked very nice, though the chain was a bit brighter than I had expected. They shipped pretty quickly, and the transaction went smoothly."
2,tangled mess and ghetto pearl,"The necklace arrived and I've spent 30 mins untangling it and still haven't gotten it untangled. The pearl looks like it's squished onto the necklace. Overall not happy, and since I don't know how it will look on me until it gets untangled. I am very disappointed in this product."
5,Good sunshade,"I always thought these things were so goofy looking and silly. Until I needed one! We needed one when our son outgrew his infant carrier and no longer had that convenient little sun canopy. We keep one in each car and they really are lifesavers when the sun is going down and it hits your baby/kid right in the face. Having these is especially helpful in a smaller car &/or a car without tinted windows. I also LOVE having plastic hooks at the top of the shade rather than suction cups, & the velcro at the bottom is also very helpful to keep those suction cups on tight."
2,Ok,"We were given these as a gift. They are pretty small and the ""First Years"" logo on the outside is huge. There are probably better products that won't make your car feel like a moving billboard."
2,a flop,"I was disappointed in the purchase. At first, I thought what great deal to have two for such a great price. Installing the screen was a different matter. I have larger windows in the back and it doesn't cover the entire window. Also because of a slight curvature in the window - the suction cup doesn't stick to the window on the bottom. The velco on the bottom is not an option for me. It still hangs there, but will need to find a better solution when he is no longer in his infant carrier with the canopy to cover from the sun."
1,dont waste your money,i got these and thought they would be pretty good. well i had them for 2 weeks and they broke. they are poorly made and would not reccomend. i got better use out of the cheapy ones at walmart they have lasted longer.
4,Good example of causes of controversy.,"Testimony from a number of contradictory sources over what happened to the ships and men; what they were told by ancestors of their beliefs of what may have happened to the men. Much debate over the names of men who were along on the trek. I found the degree of confusion and contradiction interesting in light of what is factually known of Franklin's travels to be very valuable in discounting what is ""known"" about his journey. While it resolves nothing for sure, it helps to explain why the degree of confusion among early searchers upon trying to get information from Inuits. For the true Franklin researcher, it is highly recommended."
5,Perfect for the in home jobs.,Excellent product from Dewalt. I have the 14.4 V and the 18 V drills from Dewalt and are just too big for the smaller repetitive jobs. The Christmas decorations came down in no time this January and I look forward to using this smaller driver on my next house flip. I have been rehabbing homes for the past five years and always seem to be changing out outlets and switches. This 7.2 V driver will make this job a breeze. Way to go Dewalt!
4,Nice for easy work,"This is not the strongest of screwdrivers, but it is wonderful foreveryday work.Great shipping time and great quality product."
5,Great product,This is a great product for simple things. Just remember you're not buying the most powerful drill.
3,Good BUT... Underpowered & Costly,"I'm a big fan of DeWalt and this is a good ""commercial"" grade tool. But, why DeWalt (Black & Decker) chose to only use 7.2v is a mystery. Also, being mfd in China, this tool is way over-priced.I've found a better alternative, the B&D; XD1200K 12-Volt 5-Position Drill/Driver (ASIN: B00006S7D0). About $31 on Amazon with a coupon. A second battery can be found for $30 or less, if required. Both tools are produced in the SAME Chinese factory too!12v VS 7.2v0-700 rpm VS 0-500 rpm105 in-lbs VS 80 in-lbs Torque24 VS 16 Clutch Settings5 Position VS 2 Postion Head RotationExcept for some VersaPak 'toys', the XD1200K is the only B&D; tool I own. Everything else is DeWalt. In this 'contest' however, the B&D; wins hands down. They should repackage the XD1200K as a DeWalt, raise the price, and clean up!"
2,Why,"Not bad but why would I want one. So what it can driver a 3"" deck screw. I can do that better with a cordless drill or impactdriver. This dewalt is still too big for a small screwdriver. The Milwaukee is over priced a little but it does the one thing better. Being a cordless driver. Its much smaller like a screwdriver. And you can drive a screw and then twist it like a manual screwdriver to check thightness of the screw. And dont have to worry a lot playing with the clutch so you dont strip out screws. Or like installing plastic electric plates, you can screw in then turn screw just a little manually so you dont crack the plate."
3,Did I make a mistake?,"I have been looking for a relatively small, lightweight, but high torque unit I can send ahead by FedEx when I need to uncrate one of the systems I install: these are about the size of a large refrigerator and shipped in big wooden crates with lots of long wood screws that need to be removed. This looked ideal, and I bought one. But I didn't realize it used NiCad batteries - I thought it used Li ones. NiCads don't hold their charge and don't have the power of an equivalent Li battery. I'm worried that I'll find the battery has lost lots of power when I go to use the screw driver, OR I'll have to make sure I recharge the partially charged batteries before every trip, leading to memory issues and short-lived batteries.I may end up returning this to Amazon and getting something else."
2,Bad bit release,"Needs the bit release that their impact driver has . Their impact driver's release has to be pushed forward to remove the bit. This screwdriver release merely needs to be pulled back to remove the bit. However, you bump the release often when using the screwdriver and ZING there goes your bit. I contacted DeWalt but they seemed a bit arrogant so I cannot recommend the screwdriver. (Actually it has been several years since my original review and those arrogant dumbasses at Dewalt still haven't changed the bit holder. So I can absolutely say ""do not buy this screwdriver"".)"
1,Not drop proof,I had my Dewalt screw driver only a few days and accidentally knocked it off the work bench. It landed on the hinge and broke in half. The local Dewalt service center would not cover this under warranty. I have now switched over to Bosch.
2,Not a Panasonic .,My Panasonic cordless screwdriver has more power and runs much quieter and has a smoother clutch. Also the Dewalt unit struggles to hold a charge while the Panasonic stayus charged forever.
5,Fantastic performer!,"I've used this screwdriver for about 6 months and absolutely love it. It replaced a 2.4v Milwaukee model and does everything the Milwaukee did, plus much more, for about $30 less. I use mine for assembling computers, telecom work, light woodworking, etc. In truth, I use it for about 90% of the jobs most people use big 14.4V and 18V drills for, and it's a lot easier to hold for long periods of time. Other than serious drilling, this tool does it all. It's probably the single most useful tool I own, and I'd recommend it for anyone that doesn't need an actual drill."
4,A tough well balanced little guy!,I bought this as I got tired of using my Mikita drill and switching out the bit to make it a screwdriver. This unit is well constructed and well balanced. The torque is unbelievable and the battery life is excellent. I charged it about 10 days ago after a job and went to use it and the power was still high. I did not rate it a 5 as I think that the force of spring that pops out the bit it to high and more than once this caused the bit to pop out of my hand. This is not a major pain given the frequency that I will use it but if I were use it daily it would be an issue.
2,Badly outdated,"I used this tool for a couple of years, disassembling & installing electronic equipment at work, as well as household tasks. It was a big improvement over screwdrivers, that's for sure. About the time the batteries started failing, Bosch, Makita, Milwaukee, and Ryobi came out with their screwdrivers, and I went for the Bosch PS20. Man, what a difference. The smaller 12v Litheon drivers are much lighter, smaller, and at least as powerful as the DW, and the clutch mechanism is much more 'refined' The batteries also last considerably longer. The DW was good in its day, but has been totally outclassed by the competition."
5,My favorite tool,I own 3 of these for both work and home. They rock. Best designed drill - driver I've ever used.
4,Beats Craftsman hands down!,"This is the best cordless drill/screwdriver I have ever owned. The construction is top notch, battery life is awesome and durability is second to none!I have owned several Craftsman drill drivers and of similar capabilities, but their best similar style drill/driver is gutless compared to the torque and battery life of this Dewalt driver.I also liked the bit lock/release feature of this drill-a feature not found on the Crafstman drivers.My only wish was that this driver didn't have a built-in work lamp.You can't go wrong with the purchase of this Dewalt driver."
3,Not quite enough umph,"While the cordless screwdriver is certainly handy and its lightweight is helpful when performing tasks that require extending your arm, I find that the tool just doesn't have enough horsepower to drive some screws. In one case I was replacing #10 brass screws, so there were pre-drilled holes, the screwdriver wasn't up to the challenge and I had to break out my cordless 18 volt drill."
1,Dead in 5 min,"I was **very** surprised to have this unit fail within 5 min of first operation, working under extremely light load. I have many DeWalt tools and the only failures I have ever had (and only a couple) were due to misuse. (On my part or others.) Sending it back for a replacement, and hopefully this was just a rare QA failure. I remain a strong DeWalt fan--but I suppose I had to get one lemon out of the dozens of DeWalt power tools I have purchased over the years. Have to add that I love Amazon's return process. Less than 2 minutes and it's ready for the mailperson. Can't beat that."
5,great deal,"I am a handyman and have had this screwdriver kit for 4 years. Needed new battery and for cost of 2 batteries I got another screwdriver, Great tool, never had any problems with it"
4,DeWalt DW920K-2 Cordless screwdriver,"Purchasers have different needs when they buy tools. I am a DIY'er and I wanted a portable, cordless, driver to replace one that would no longer hold a charge. My new driver would be used in my shop and around our house. It would do those things I would otherwise use a standard screwdriver for. I also wanted a ni-cad battery. At 7.2 v. this unit meets my needs. It is comfortable to use and it is conveniently stored in a hard case.It is my understanding that this unit is being discontinued by DeWalt which may explain the reduced price, which fits in with my philosophy of paying only a reasonable price for tools that I would like to have but can get along without."
5,Great driver,"This is a great screwdriver. I was skeptical at first but after a dozen or so 3 inch drywall screws i was impressed. I have yet to come across something this guy cant handle. Good battery life, great clutch, and plenty of power. Its a winner in my book"
3,Good Tool but the Battery has to go,"I've had this tool for a few years and it has done everything I could expect of it. Now that it's a few years old I find the batteries are not holding a charge for more than an hour of sporadic use. It wasn't much better when they were new either. They are STILL using Nicads in this tool. I think it's the only tool left not using NiMH or Lithium Ion. Two batteries are a MUST because when this tool dies, it dies. If it used LIon or NiMH I'd happily replace it now but I'm very disappointed to see the Nicads are still being used. It would get 5 stars if it used other batteries."
5,TIME SAVER!,"This little screwdriver is such a timesaver. I own an appliance repair business and use it daily. When used within the purposes of its intention, it performs flawlessly. As long as someone doesn't explect it to do the work of an 18 volt XRP drill, driver, they won't be disappointed!"
5,Best tool of this type ever,The Dewalt is a great cordless screwdriver. The two batteries make it impossible to run out of a charge and the torque control is great. Tool has very good balance and can handle just about everything you can think of for a cordless driver. Also does very good light drilling
5,My First DeWalt - Excellent,"An electrician doing some work at my house had this tool and recommended it, so I gave it to myself as a Christmas gift (who better). It is one tool I use all the time. It is extremely versatile as a screwdriver and makes a great drill for SMALL jobs (even though it is not designed as a drill). I love my B&D Versapac screwdrivers, but this beats them by far. This was my first Dewalt tool and I was so happy with it I bought two more as gifts for my brother in law and a lifelong friend. Replacement batteries are a bit expensive, so when the time is right I will probably just buy a whole new set. I highly recommend this tool."
5,"Decks, Tile Backer, & Computers Too","I have used this amazing little giant to install almost 1000 square feet of cedar decking and about half that of tile backer. It is indefatigable, and unlike its larger bretheren, it can be very accurately controlled. (No ""over-driven"" deck screws.) While decking, I never had to wait for a charged battery - one would lose power just as the other obtained full charge.And by dialing back the clutch, I have put this little demon to work on some very delicate items: Electrical outlet faceplates, computer components, etc.The only complaint is occasionally losing a bit due to the chuck being inadvertently activated by clothing or some other object. This is particularly annoying if you are up on a ladder, or if the bit rolls off the deck and into the river."
5,Wanted one for a long time,I have been wanting this screwdriver kit for a long time. I have seen professionals utilize this and have read reviews on it. I was sold. I waited and found it on Amazon yesterday for $62. I couldn't pass it up. Very happy!!!
5,Dewalt DW920K 7.2 volt cordless screwdriver Kit,Excellent small drill for light jobs or tight places with the angle being a advantage. Charges fast..light weight and easy to control. Real handy for the long screws..
2,Wobble Wobble,"So I rarely leave bad reviews because I usually only buy products that have a history off good reviews. And I thought the same of this item. 240 reviews and 4.5 star average is pretty outstanding on Amazon. So I was excited to receive this item. But this thing wobbles! What the heck? I read a few reviews that said this, but that it was just the chuck. Well I put in a long 3 inch screw bit and the wobbling was obvious. Did I just get a defective one? How can you make a drill that does this? It has one job...to drill and drill straight! I am very displeased especially at the price and reputation of this brand. I will be calling dewalt today and report back. Anyone else had this issue or have a fix?"
